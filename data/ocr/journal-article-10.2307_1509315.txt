MCMASTER UNIVERSITY HAMILTON, ONTARIO, CANADA THERE is a large and growing number of people, both Catholic and Protestant, who are coming to recognize Karl Rahner, S.J., as the most important Roman Catholic theologian of the present period.' While a number of books and articles on Rahner are beginning to appear, most of them are limited simply to exposit- ing his position.2 What has yet to be done in a satisfactory way is to think through critically his relationship to and significance for the wider theological enterprise, that is, in terms of the inter- confessional discussion (as well as in terms of current secular reflection upon general human experience). Rahner's work de- serves such consideration, although, because of the fact that since the Reformation and Vatican I Protestant and Catholic thought have tended to develop independently of each other, it is difficult for one schooled sufficiently in Rahner's tradition to understand his work to understand Protestant thought sufficiently well to make a discussion meaningful, and the opposite situation is also the case.3 Without claiming exemption from this handicap, I should like to make a beginning at the sort of clarification and critical analysis that seems to me to be needed. Two important young Protestant thinkers have recently made significant attempts to clarify the meaning of Rahner for Protes- 1 The other name most frequently mentioned is that of Bernard Lonergan, S.J., but at the time of this writing his generally available work is mostly in philosophy. Philosophically speaking, Rahner and Lonergan have much in common inasmuch as both employ the so-called "Transcendental Method." For a discussion of this method and their relationship to it see OTTo MUCK, S.J., The Transcendental Method, translated by William D. Seidensticker (New York: Herder and Herder, 1968). 2 E.g., DONALD L.

George Lindbeck showed the similarities be- tween Rahner and Bonhoeffer, Barth, and Tillich. Schubert Ogden argued that the greatest similarity is between Rahner and Bultmann. While recognizing the merit of these comparisons, I should like to argue that the most significant point of contact is that to be found between Rahner and Ogden himself. Naturally, since the former is a Roman Catholic and the latter is a Protes- tant, one could with reason expect to find substantial differences in their theologies. Moreover, since Rahner is some twenty-odd years Ogden's senior and has been publishing voluminously for years, while Ogden is still in the early stages of developing his position, it may seem premature to attempt a comparative study at this early date. Yet the two thinkers have enunciated distinct approaches, and, furthermore, their thought represents certain tendencies within their respective traditions which are capable of comparison. This article is offered as a beginning attempt to bring the two positions into dialogue. It will focus on the funda- mental issues surrounding the question of religious knowledge. Analytically, it will attempt to clarify the similarities and differ- ences; constructively, it will attempt to assess the latter and to suggest possible resolutions and lines of possible discussion that may prove to be fruitful. I The first striking similarity between Rahner and Ogden is their common commitment to what might be called an anthropological theological orientation. By this is meant a commitment to begin with man, to attempt to think through and express the meaning of theological assertions in terms of human self-understanding. Perhaps this mutual orientation can in part be accounted for genetically by their mutual encounter as young men with the work of the "early" Martin Heidegger.5 At any rate, at a time ' GEORGE LINDBECK, The Thought of Karl Rahner, S.J., Christianity and Cul- ture (October 18, 1965), 211-14.

In other words, whatever else they con- ceive theology to be, they both insist that theology to be rightly understood must be seen as the self-reflexive and thematic expres- sion of faith that has its original and proper locus in man's own mode of existential self-understanding. Thus, for example, for both men theological affirmations about God the creator spring from and express man's understanding of himself as a finite, con- tingent, incomplete creature, radically dependent upon an infinite, necessary, fulfilling, and eternal reality outside of himself.7 Like- wise, eschatological statements have their hermeneutical locus in man's experience of himself as impotent before the abyss of non- being, yet radically confident that the last power with which we all have to do is benevolent and trustworthy. As Rahner puts it, "an eschatological assertion is not an additional, supplementary statement appended to an assertion about the present and the past of man but an inner moment of this self-understanding of man." s And Ogden speaks similarly: o . our eschatological questions and answers offer but one more way in which the meaning and scope of Christian faith itself are explained and made clear . . . If we are not to think of eschatology as a kind of pseudo science in which we build wild guesses and hunches about the future into a structure no more secure than the weakest point; or, if we are not to reduce faith to a loose collection of independent articles of belief . . . , then we must be clear that eschatology is tigations, I (Baltimore: Helicon Press, 1963), xiiff.

The first is philosophi- cal, inasmuch as both men are influenced by and committed to philosophical positions according to which the human subject is the central datum of metaphysical speculation. For Rahner this position is that of "transcendental Thomism"; for Ogden it is "process metaphysics." Rahner's type of Thomism, stimulated in large part by Rahn- er's study of the work of the Belgium Jesuit Joseph Marechal,1o is an attempt to rethink the philosophia perennis in light of con- temporary "critical" philosophy. That is, instead of dismissing the post-Cartesian and especially the Kantian development as a simple case of taking a "wrong turn" (as traditional Thomism and even the sophisticated philosophy of Gilson and Maritain tended to do), Rahner accepts the problematic as a legitimate and important one and seeks to think through it. The modern trend can be characterized as a concern not simply with examining philosophical conclusions critically, but more specifically with examining the human cognitive possibilities, the situation with its limitations and potentialities which both permit and control man's attempt to know. In other words, whereas traditional phi- losophy focused initially and primarily upon the cosmos and hence external reality, Rahner follows Descartes, Kant, and Heidegger in focusing upon the subject and his act of self-knowledge as the key access to knowledge of the real. And instead of trying to comprehend the human self as a mere instance of being already understood on the basis of external reality (and employing a "naturalistic" model), transcendental Thomism turns to the sub- ject at the outset. That is, it urges man to "look within," to at- tend to his own experience of himself as a rational being as the most accessible manifestation of being.

Seidensticker (New York: Herder and Herder, 1968), i8iff.</page><page sequence="5">RAHNER AND OGDEN 381 standing is the paradigm for understanding the external world and not vice versa. Rahner's most elaborate development of this position is to be found in his doctoral dissertation in philosophy (written in the mid-'3o's, while he was studying Scholasticism with Martin Honecker, Kant and Heidegger with Heidegger, and Marechal on his own)," subsequently published as Geist in Welt.12 The book is Rahner's attempt to answer the question as to how meta- physics is possible if human knowledge is sense experience or sensible intuition. In addition to being a magnificently learned study of St. Thomas, the book is a forceful argument against two types of philosophical opponents. (i) It argues against tra- ditionalists who have failed to accept the modern "turn toward the subject," who want to go about their metaphysical business as usual, more or less oblivious to the post-Cartesian critical questions, appealing to a supposedly direct intuition of being or an inference of God from observations of the external world. (2) It argues also, however, against Kant and Heidegger that meta- physics is possible even on the terms of their own anthropological analysis. We will attend to the second point in the section to follow; here we will seek to understand the first. The title of the book is indicative of the argument. Attention should be given to both the "Geist" and the "in Welt"; for Rahner emphasizes both. Man first of all is inescapably "in the world," in the sense that whatever knowledge he may hope to gain of the Transcendent will of necessity be mediated and conditioned by his "installment" in the material and historical. There is no direct, unmediated knowledge of being - contra a priorism, ontologism, popular mysticism, and some forms of traditional Thomism. With Kant in mind he emphasizes that for Aquinas all knowledge of reality begins with and is mediated by sensible intuition. (For Rahner and Aquinas, all knowledge is based upon the "phan- tasms.") In this sense, then, we can see why he is philosophically committed to beginning with man. But this is not so radical or new; many a Thomist has recognized this aspect of the master's n FRANCIS P.

For English translation, cf. ibid.</page><page sequence="6">382 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW teaching before."3 However, it is the way in which Rahner is faithful to man's worldly installment that marks him off from traditionalists. He will not allow that man can quickly leap from his encounter with the finite to the infinite inferentially. This neglects the seriousness of Kant's critique. Rather it must be shown that transcendental knowledge is possible by analyzing the conditions of human knowing.'4 Hence we must attend to the subject with the greatest care. This, however, still is too ob- jectivistic to describe Rahner's orientation, for it is not simply to man in general that one must turn to provide the critical founda- tion. It is, to be precise, to oneself, to an awareness of the dyna- mism of one's own rational and existential selfhood that one must turn. One must note this insistence in Rahner's thought if one is to see the full scope and intensity of his anthropological orienta- tion. The point will become clearer when we have finished the second section of the essay. But the following should help fill it in for now. Rahner, to repeat, accepts Kant's problematic and generally accepts Kant's analysis of cognition so far as it goes. But he insists, in effect, that it does not go far enough: knowledge involves percepts, concepts, synthesis, and judgments - and it is the last aspect of knowledge that Rahner believes Kant has neglected. And it is in terms of judging that metaphysical truth is known. On this account, a judgment is a personal act, whereby an affirma- tion of two "things" is made. There is an affirmation whereby we judge an empirical state of affairs to be the case. This is a direct affirmation. But there is also an indirect affirmation of an "hori- zon," in terms of which the direct affirmation has its meaning. Hence, every judgment affirms not only something about what is perceived and conceived but it also affirms the meaningfulness and intelligibility of the comprehending horizon. But, of course, every limited horizon can in turn be questioned and judged, and that in terms of a wider horizon. Below we shall see how Rahner wants to go beyond Kant and Heidegger to show how man can know God, in fact to show how God is co-affirmed and co-known 1"See, e.g., F. C. COPLESTON, S.J., Aquinas (Baltimore: Penguin Books, Inc., 1955), 26. "1 For the most important statements of this point see RAHNER, Geist in Welt, 69ff.</page><page sequence="7">RAHNER AND OGDEN 383 in our knowledge of anything. The point here, however, is on the other flank; it is to show how man's knowledge of being and being-itself (God) is possible only in terms of man's turning within in an act of appropriating his own rational and volitional consciousness."5 It is only by man's act of judging that he is open to God (that he is "spirit") and it is only by understanding one's own judging that one can understand one's openness to God; or, further, only then and in that manner can one understand being- itself at all. Ogden's philosophical commitment also inclines him toward the anthropological orientation. If Rahner's philosophical father is Marechal, Ogden's is Charles Hartshorne. And it is in terms of Hartshorne that Ogden's philosophy ("process metaphysics") must be understood.16 Let us note the relevance of this heritage for the question at hand. Hartshorne's philosophy rests upon the principle of "reformed subjectivism." 17 The reformed subjectiv- ist principle is a modification of Descartes' "subjectivist princi- ple," according to which Descartes sought to base all reflections upon the self and its indubitable convictions of what is real. Hartshorne accepts Descartes' intention and procedure; he only "reforms" Descartes' analysis of the basic datum of the human cogito. Hartshorne insists that man's experience cannot be ex- haustively analyzed in terms of (i) external, sense experience and (2) a bare and isolated thinking substance. In addition to (I), he argues that even more immediate to man than external sense perception is the nonsensuous and existential awareness of oneself. In this he is not too different from Descartes. But against (2) he contends that basic to this awareness is the self's experience of himself as part of a larger whole, as inextricably a component of a social reality. This awareness provides man with an "inside" view of reality; it serves as our most accessible meta- physical sample, so to speak. It is only in terms of an analysis 1Ibid., I8if. and 387ff., especially 389. " OGDEN expresses his affinity with HARTSHORNE in many places. For a very ex- plicit statement see his Bultmann's Demythologizing and Hartshorne's Dipolar Theism, The Hartshorne Festschrift: Process and Divinity, edited by William L. Reece and Eugene Freeman (LaSalle, Illinois: Open Court Publishing Company, 1964), 493-514. 1 HARTSHORNE, Reality as Social Process: Studies in Metaphysics and Religion (Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1953), 71.</page><page sequence="8">384 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of this experience that one can move on to formulating meta- physical principles, or generic traits, applicable to all other levels of reality (from quantum units to God). Hartshorne puts it di- rectly: "(all generic principles), whatever else they may be, must be variables of human experience." 18 Ogden endorses the ap- proach: A point for a genuinely new theistic conception is "the reformed subjectivist principle." . . . the principle requires that we take as the experiential basis of all our most fundamental concepts the primal phenomenon of our own existence as experiencing subjects or selves.19 In sum, then, just as Rahner comes to the anthropological start- ing point by way of Marechal, Ogden comes by way of Hart- shorne. Moreover, the effect of Heidegger on both men has, no doubt, served to reinforce this common commitment.20 Hence, we can understand the philosophical reasons behind their similar starting point. There is also a similar theological reason for their mutual anthropological point of view. It is rooted in the doctrines of revelation and, more concretely, Christology. Let us turn first to Rahner. For Rahner, a distinction may be made between "unthematic" and "thematic" revelation. Man is a creature who must constitute himself, through the exercise of his rational freedom, in making judgments. Judgments, as we saw above, can occur only with reference to an infinite horizon. This is what it means for man to be "spirit." 21 It is essential to man's nature and is called by Rahner human "potentia obedientialis." 22 And inasmuch as man discovers this horizon to be filled with God's gracious presence, and not simply the empty horizon of God's silence, then one experiences unthematic revelation. This aware- 8 Ibid., 29ff. and 69ff. OGDEN, The Reality of God, 57. 2o Furthermore, it is instructive to note that it is the "early" rather than the "later" HEIDEGGER that has impressed RAHNER and OGDEN the most.

It is also such because it is known implicitly and existentially by man before it can even possibly be under- stood explicitly and conceptually. It is now within this context that we can understand thematic revelation as it is found in Christ. Since man is a conscious being, he can profit from explicit, conceptual knowledge as well as the more primitive and implicit kind. This is the function of what we might commonly under- stand as historical revelation (Rahner's term: "categorical reve- lation") as opposed to "transcendental revelation" (i.e., thematic as opposed to unthematic 24). Historical revelation is an event within the world that can serve to represent in an explicit way the truth of the graciousness of that horizon that is already known implicitly to encompass the world.25 Let us use an analogy in the field of dramatic arts. When one goes to the theatre, one already knows, presumably, at a personal, existential level of guilt, love, forgiveness, etc. But the dramatic presentation serves to express at an explicit level what we already more or less implicitly know. In this way it "thematizes" what is present "unthematically." By grasping its content thematically, we are in a position to make it a part of our consciously cognitive and volitional life. Histori- cal events serve religiously, to press the analogy, as the dramatic productions which mediate and re-present the meaning of the horizon already present to our ordinary judgments.26 Since man knows through encounter with "objects," some thing, person, or event is necessary to mediate and help express the divine. The Christ event is the decisive and normative such event.27 In short, man's knowledge of being-itself occurs only in man's personal act of judgment, which is inevitably prompted by en- counter with objects. More concretely, man is able to know God - which, of course, is the God of revelation - only through 23 Ibid., 161. " RAHNER, Hiirer des Wortes, 87. 25 Ibid., I87f., note. 26 Ibid.

The force of this event is the making possible of human self-knowledge or, more precisely, human knowledge of self encompassed by divine grace. Revelation under- stood apart from this anthropological, existential setting is revela- tion misunderstood. For example, in Rahner's discussion of the theology of death, he urges that man's death and Christ's saving act of laying down his own life must be understood from "within," so to speak.28 He condemns as "mythological" theological state- ments that fail to relate to the dynamism of the self. Rightly understood, however, theology can overcome the disjunction be- tween anthropology and theology, for God is seen precisely in relation to the fulfillment of man's spiritual existence. In this sense, we can understand Rahner's words: Theology is extrinsic to anthropology in the sense that man's center is essentially outside man; it is in God. Insofar as man accepts his exteriority and is willing to see his center as being outside himself, he truly finds himself. By contrast, any attempt to leap outside one- self which is not anthropocentric in orientation is inhuman and there- fore contrary to God. Man draws close to God, not as he becomes less himself, but as he humbly grows to realize that God has called all things to being. This is even more true when Christ enters the picture. Because the Word of God became man, the opposition be- tween theocentrism and anthropocentrism has been surmounted . . now all theology, be it theoretical or practical, is also anthro- pological.29 It was stated above that Ogden's anthropological orientation also has a theological foundation, as well as a philosophical one. We can see this if we attend to his argument in his first book, Christ without Myth: A Study Based on the Theology of Rudolf Bultmann.30 As the title suggests, the work is a study of Bult- mann's program. According to this program, as is well known, it is argued that the New Testament is expressed in a mythological 2 RAHNER, On the Theology of Death (New York: Herder and Herder, 1962), passim.

It is also well known that the reason the scriptures must be demythologized and rein- terpreted is that the mythological world view has been contradict- ed by the modern world view and modern man's understanding of himself. But this is only one reason, and it is not strictly speaking and on last analysis a theological reason at all. However, it is less well known that for Ogden (and for Bultmann) the primary rea- son for carrying out this program is theological, or in Ogden's words "it is something the kerygma itself demands." "3 This is so, Ogden contends, for at least two reasons. First, an adequate theol- ogy must demythologize and existentially reinterpret because "the defining characteristic of myth, or of mythological thinking, is that it 'objectifies' . . . a reality (i.e. God) that is not an 'ob- ject' ". 32 That is, mythical thinking misinterprets the modal status of God.33 God, who is actually the infinite subject who encompasses the world, is conceived as though he were actually identifiable with an objective situation within the world. God who is the "horizon" (Ogden would probably accept Rahner's term) of our understanding is falsely conceived as though he were a possible object that we could perceive and even judge. Therefore, in the name of the infinite, sovereign God, who transcends the world, the theologian must demythologize the myths and rein- terpret them according to their existential motifs, i.e., in terms of man's understanding of himself as part of an all-encompassing, nonobjectifiable whole. The second theological reason springs from Ogden's understand- ing of the universality of God's love with its all-embracing gift and demand. That is, if we believe on the basis of revelation that all men everywhere and at all times are sinners and, as St. Paul says, "without excuse" (Romans : I8ff.), then we have reason to infer that all men are also confronted with the gift, the refusal of which confers guilt.34 Sin is, in short, analogous to a lie rather 31 Ibid., 43. 2 Ibid., 25, parentheses mine. 3 As OGDEN notes, mythological thinking commits what GILBERT RYLE calls a "category mistake," according to which there is "the presentation of facts belong- ing to one category in the idioms appropriate to another." Cf. OGDEN, The Reality of God, 105. Cf. GILBERT RYLE, The Concept of Mind (London: Hutchinson and Company, Ltd., 1949), 8. " OGDEN, Christ without Myth, i54.</page><page sequence="12">388 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW than a mere error; it is a case of knowing the truth (about God) and suppressing it. But it simply would not be the case that all men could be held so accountable if the possibility of knowing the love of God were determined by knowing certain objective historical events, from which most men are after all for all practi- cal purposes far removed in time and space. Mythological efforts to so identify God "objectively" must be demythologized etc. precisely on the theological grounds that it falsifies the universal- ity of God's grace and human responsibility. As Ogden puts it, "Christian faith is to be interpreted exhaustively . . . as man's original possibility of authentic existence. .. ." 35 And he makes clear the reason for this assertion: "Christian faith is always a 'possibility in fact' because of the unconditioned gift and demand of God's love which is the everpresent ground and end of all created things. .. ." 36 This does not make the event of Jesus Christ irrelevant, of course. While, for reasons stated above, Jesus' finality cannot be interpreted as an exclusive manifestation of God nor can he simply be identified with God in any non-dialectical way, he is understood to be of decisive significance as a normative re-pre- sentation of God's love "which fulfills and corrects all other mani- festations. . . ." 3 But one should note the character of the "truth" which Jesus bears: Therefore, we should argue (that we must) observe the important distinction between "knowledge about" and "knowledge of" . . . The statement that Jesus is the decisive re-presentation of the truth of man's existence can be appropriately clarified only when it is recognized that "truth" here is not the timeless truth of "knowledge about," but the existentiell truth of "knowledge of." What confronts us in Jesus is not, in its first intention, a "world view" addressed to our intellects, but a possibility of self-understanding that requires a personal decision.38 The "existentiell truth" of which Ogden speaks is, of course, not truth attained by observation of the external world but the per- 35Ibid., I46. SIbid., I53. 3 Ibid., I53. 3" Ibid., 162.</page><page sequence="13">RAHNER AND OGDEN 389 sonal and "original internal awareness of our selves and the world. . ." 39 This truth, as represented in Jesus, serves as the hermeneutical principle for understanding all legitimate theologi- cal assertions about God, world, and man.40 What we have seen, then, is that both Rahner and Ogden have theological reasons, and similar theological reasons, as well as philosophical ones, for their mutual anthropological orientation. Of course, one might observe that the theological reasons in both cases are predetermined by philosophical positions; hence we have a circular sort of operation. There is some truth to this and it is understandable, given the authors' common conviction that a sound theology is dependent in a way upon philosophical foundations.4" But, as Paul Tillich has pointed out, all theological thinking is in a sense circular and that not necessarily in a vi- cious way.42 What both subjects of this study have tried to do is to articulate positions that are both intelligible and appropriate to the Christian revelation. The anthropological point common to both is that theology finds its basis in the existential self-under- standing of the human subject. II In light of the discussion above one can understand why both Rahner and Ogden are sympathetic up to a point with Bultmann's program.43 There is a sense in which both could subscribe to Bultmann's contention that to speak about God is to speak about one's personal existence.44 But they would once again be one in 39OGDEN, The Reality of God, o104. OGDEN distinguishes clearly between "our inner nonsensuous perception of ourselves and the world as parts of an encompass- ing whole and the outer perceptions through our senses whereby we discriminate the behavior of all the different beings of which we are originally aware."

They would be concerned that the original unsupplemented contention is subject to a Van Buren-like reductionism, whereby theology is seen finally as speaking only about man.46 While it is clear that Bultmann does not intend to speak only about man, it is not clear how he intends in fact to head off this sort of reductionism. This weakness stems in large part from his rather uncritical acceptance of Kant. One sees Kant's influence in Bultmann's assumption that (I) the reality of God is indemon- strable and (2) direct language about God falsely "objectifies" him. Hence one can "know" God only on the basis of a revela- tion, which is conceived in a manner similar to that of the "early" Barth: as a tangent which touches and yet does not touch a circle (Senkrecht von oben, etc.)."4 That this is an unsatisfactory escape from reductionism is witnessed to by the widespread col- lapse of dialectical theology. Perhaps the "death of God" move- ment is the final reductio ad absurdum of this approach. This, doubtless, would offend Bultmann. But be this as it may, while Bultmann fails to provide an explicit account of his overcoming of anthropological reductionism, Rahner and Ogden do provide such an account. For all their anthropological concern, they clearly argue that theology can and must speak about God as well as man. They do this by seeking to overcome the Kantian road- block and they do this largely by recourse to both philosophia perennis and a chastened sort of Idealism." Let us turn to their arguments. The bare outline of their position is: (i) while both accept the "turn toward the subject" which characterizes post-Cartesian and 4 RAHNER, Theological Dictionary, 121-23.

(2) Rather, both seek to show that man's knowledge of himself is always a knowledge of him- self within the context of the all-encompassing horizon of "being" (Rahner) or "reality" (Ogden) - the chief exemplification of which is God. In short, self-knowledge and knowledge of God are inseparable. (3) They attempt to show that this is so by analyzing both ordinary cognition and man's moral experience. Rahner's most elaborate attempt to demonstrate that God is a possible "object" of theological assertions occurs in his discus- sion of ordinary cognition. We noted in section I that Geist in Welt wages an offensive on two fronts. We dwelt above primarily on its effort to show traditionists the full import of man's in- stallment in the world. This is the point of the second part of the title. But now we should observe that it also argues against Kant and Heidegger that man as "spirit" is able to apprehend not only the data of "sensible intuition" but also metaphysical being. This is so, as we saw above, by virtue of judgment. Knowledge involves not only percepts and concepts but also the existential act of judgment. Judgment is possible only by grasping the manifold of perception within the context of an horizon of meaning. Judg- ment does not grasp the horizon as an object; rather, in its act of grasping objects it pre-apprehends ("vorgreifen") being-itself. For example, when the intellect judges that this or that is true, it does so by reference to a horizon which supports and gives force to the judgment. Insofar as it judges a thing limited or contin- gent, it does so only by virtue of a co-awareness of the unlimited and necessary. Insofar as it judges a thing relative, it does so by reference to a standpoint which is itself absolute. Kant's mistake, according to Rahner, was his failure to see that his own attempt to judge the real limits of knowledge was systematically possible only by reference to a standard of reference which transcends those limits.49 Rahner summarizes his argument in the following way: In every affirmation it makes, the human mind affirms, at least im- plicitly, absolute being as the real ground of the metaphysical princi- ples of being and knowledge that are assumed without qualification " In addition to the general argument of Geist in Welt, see RAHNER'S H Irer des Wortes, 8o.</page><page sequence="16">392 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW when any statement is made, and further affirms absolute being as mystery and - in the eminent sense-- as personal being . . . the silent horizon of all intellectual encounter with being, is thus always implicitly conjointly affirmed in every affirmation. .. .50 On this account then, insofar as the self knows itself (or any- thing else), it co-knows being-itself (God) as the a priori condi- tion of its very act. The final purpose of the so-called "proofs" is not to present to man from without, as it were, with news about an object previously quite unknown and hence irrelevant to him; it is rather to convey the reflex consciousness that always and everywhere in his spiritual existence man has dealings with God-- whether he calls him "God" or something else, whether he reflects on the fact or not, . . .51 In short the point of the "proofs" is to demonstrate to man that all knowledge . . ., whatever it may concern, so long as this knowl- edge posits something real - at least its own act - occurs against the background of an affirmation of (God).52 In short, Rahner's "transcendental" analysis of cognition is sim- ilar to Kant's in that it attempts to analyze the a priori condi- tions which make human knowledge possible. His advance be- yond Kant is to show that an awareness of being, of which God is the chief exemplification, is one of these conditions. While Ogden's effort to overcome Kant is largely developed in another context (see below), he gives us good reason to believe that he would be in basic agreement with Rahner's approach just outlined. For example, he speaks of the metaphysical reality of God neces- sarily presupposed by "our scientific reasoning." 5 He develops this point to some degree in his discussion with Antony Flew, to wit: he argues that all cognitive judgments occur within a con- text that is necessarily believed to be an ordered whole. Since every judgment must exemplify this belief and no conceivable judgment could falsify it, we may believe that "reality is an ordered whole" is a necessary truth and the presupposition of all I Theological Dictionary, IoSf. 5 Ibid., 38If. 5 Ibid. 8 OGDEN, The Reality of God, 43.</page><page sequence="17">RAHNER AND OGDEN 393 scientific judgments (and acts of ordinary cognition). It is then a short step for Ogden to argue from this that the idea of a neces- sary order is equivalent to the being and work of God. (What else short of God could give necessity to the order?) 5 Second, knowledge of God is also demonstrated by both men in the context of man's moral experience. Here, however, it is Ogden that develops the argument the more thoroughly. Ogden argues throughout The Reality of God that all of man's moral efforts are rooted in an unfalsifiable confidence or awareness that life is worth living. That is, all moral decisions between concrete possibilities have in common an undeniable existential confidence in the permanent worth of our lives. "Even the suicide who in- tentionally takes his own life implicitly affirms the ultimate mean- ing of his tragic choice." " This belief is the motivation for act- ing to any end whatsoever. It is, hence, an unavoidable, neces- sary belief, since even the attempt to deny it itself affirms it. Ogden illustrates this point vis-a-vis Camus' notion of the "absurd hero": . . intriguing as this notion of the absurd hero doubtless is, it can hardly define a real possibility, whether for thought or existential choice. If all our actions are in principle absurd, the act of heroically resisting their absurdity must also be absurd . . . (but) insofar as resistance . . . is a meaningful act . . . the absurdity of our existence cannot be as unrelieved as was originally alleged.56 Finally, for Ogden, to understand that one's life is ultimately valuable is to imply that it is ultimately valued and this is equiva- lent to a belief in God.57 While Rahner does not develop this idea as extensively as does Ogden or as extensively as he himself develops the argument from ordinary cognition, it is nevertheless present, especially in his most recent writings. He argues, for example, that if . . . values and norms are to carry any absolute obligation it can only be on the basis of man's transcendence, even in morals, with S"OGDEN, God and Philosophy: A Discussion with Antony Flew, Journal of Religion (April, 1968), i6iff., 169f.

Thus even an atheist ethics which is subjectively self-contained is just as impossible as atheism itself.5" He does state, even more boldly, that insofar as one asserts any- thing to be of absolute and unforfeitable worth, even if that thing is an affirmation of the value of atheism, then one implicitly affirms that the whole of reality is such as to permit and sustain this value and hence that ultimate reality itself is the very op- posite of "the abyss of utter absurdity." 59 Now we have seen that Rahner and Ogden both want to go beyond Kant and to argue that an affirmation of God is at least implicitly present and necessarily presupposed by man's cogni- tive and moral activities. Let us pause to note the status of such an affirmation. Rahner, as stated above, develops his arguments most extensively in relationship to human cognition rather than moral awareness. He speaks of this affirmation as a kind of knowledge.60 But this needs clarification since it is a knowledge of a very particular kind. It is knowledge, not in the sense of an "objectifying" sort, whereby we know or can prove the existence of God in the same way we can know or prove the existence of an ordinary object mediated by "sensible intuition." Rahner's con- tention is rather more like that of St. Augustine, according to which the saint reasoned that God functions in regard to the intellect analogously to the way the sun functions in regard to the eye. God is not seen (known) directly but functions rather to provide the indispensable context in which we can see (think about) anything at all (the Lumen Intellectus). God is the ground of intelligibility presupposed by every intellectual act; He is the "horizon" of intelligibility, present a priori in every pos- teriori judgment." Ogden argues similarly, as we have seen, though primarily in the context of man's moral experience: God is implicitly presup- posed as the valuer of human existence as the "background" of s RAHNER, Theological Dictionary, 42. ~ RAHNER, Do You Believe in God? (New York: Newman Press, 1969), 7. RAHNER frequently cites this point in developing his notion of the "anonymous Christian." Cf.

The dif- ference is little more than verbal, however. Neither man claims that God can be known as an object over which we have con- trol; God is rather the first principle of all our knowledge. In- sofar as we make judgments of any sort, they inevitably rest upon a concomitant affirmation of the reality of an intelligible whole within which such judgments count for something. (Even the judgment that reality is absurd affirms that the "whole" or "hori- zon" is such as to make such a judgment both meaningful and warranted; hence the judgment contradicts itself and implicitly affirms its contradictory.) What is the status of this affirmation? It isn't itself knowledge, it seems, if we mean by knowledge some- thing we can prove. But the very effort to prove anything what- soever assumes it to be true. But it isn't merely faith either, if we mean by faith something subrational, suprarational, irrational, or of the nature of a "leap." Rather it would seem that Ogden and Rahner have helped us to see that there is something in be- tween the making of everything depend upon proof, as theologi- cal rationalists have tended to do, and dispensing with proofs altogether, as has been the tendency of Protestant thought since Schleiermacher. That something is recognition that "proofs (or reason) must rest upon insights." 64 In this they seem to have rediscovered something like the methodological foundation articu- lated by St. Augustine both in his epistemological program of fides quaerens intellectum and in his description of God as the lumen intellectus. It is the calling attention to the fact that rea- son itself rests upon and is the reflection of an existential trust. But there is a sense in which this trust is different from the belief often denoted in the dichotomy of belief vs. reason, for that dis- tinction usually derives its significance only in situations in which there are several possible alternative beliefs among which one may choose. But if we say that every judgment illustrates the belief 62 OGDEN, The Reality of God, 138f. 3 Ibid., 21-43. 6 HARTSHORNE, Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism (New York: Harper and Brothers, 194i), 59.</page><page sequence="20">396 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW that God exists and that no conceivable judgment could falsify it, since per Rahner and Ogden every act of judgment presupposes this belief as an a priori, then we are dealing with an ultimate principle and it is rather inconsequential whether we say we know it or believe it.65 Kant, of course, would doubtless object at this point that all that has been shown is that such a belief is a "regulative idea," but that it has not been shown that it is in any sense "constitu- tive." This objection, however, assumes that only those ideas based upon "sensous intuition" can be cognitively significant ("constitutive").6" This is obviously an important obstacle for any philosophical theologian. We cannot examine in any detail Rahner's and Ogden's attempt to meet it here. But we can observe the direction of this answer. (i) They challenge Kant's insistence that all knowledge must be of data delivered solely by sense data; and (2) they strive to show that even judgments of such data rest upon what Rahner calls a pre-apprehension or co-knowledge of Being or Reality itself. The Kantian problematic is at the root of Rahner's Spirit in the World. So far as I know, Ogden has not explicitly dealt with this form of the Kantian challenge. It seems safe to assume, however, in light of his general indebted- ness to and agreement with Hartshorne, that he holds with the lat- ter to the Roycean response which is almost identical with that of Rahner and is characterized in the two points above. In brief, Royce's argument is that an appeal to an absolute knower is logically affirmed in every act of judgment. This is evident, he contends, in that it is impossible to define error unless we refer, at least implicitly, to an ideal truth known by a perfect mind. A real error must be an error about a real being and must fail to conform to a real truth about that being. This real being and real truth are what man's judgment aims at and can never fully attain. The object of our intention in trying to know is an ideal limit which gives our cognitive activity its point. But if this goal is to be binding upon human cognition, it cannot be a mere projection or empty regulative notion.

Whenever man either recognizes his fallibility or asserts that thus and so is true, he intentionally refers to reality as known by God.67 This is only verbally different, it would appear, from Rahner's argument that an affirmation of the "luminosity of be- ing," the chief exemplification of which is God's knowledge of Being, is affirmed in every human act of judgment. Incidentally, we can see at this point how there is an important sense in which philosophy can be said to mediate religion. This is different from and a move beyond Bultmann, who accepts the Kantian limitations, inasmuch as, on their account, it is given to philosophy not simply to speak of man but also to speak of God, not only to clarify the possibilities of human existence sim- pliciter but to clarify the possibilities of human existence vis-a-vis the actuality of God. But their position is also a break with Hegel inasmuch as there is not ultimate surpassing (and Aufhe- bung) of faith by reason; rather it is shown that reason itself rests upon and can only attain to a certain kind of faith. But un- like Kierkegaard, who also wanted to reverse Hegel's understand- ing of the relation between reason and faith, this faith is neither arbitrary nor a "leap"; it is inevitable and rational. If the presentation has been successful so far, we have estab- lished that both Rahner and Ogden, beginning at an anthropologi- cal level, have shown that the basic datum of human conscious- ness is the simultaneity of man's knowledge of himself and of God, more precisely of himself over against and open to the Transcendent. But beyond this level of agreement there are some significant differences. They largely center around the way in which the Transcendent or God is conceived. To anticipate, Rahner describes God in a basically classical fashion and Ogden in a "neo-classical" way. The systematic reasons for this differ- ence largely grow out of different ways of understanding the na- ture of knowledge itself. 8 JOSIAH ROYCE, The Possibility of Error, The Religious Philosophy of Josiah Royce, edited by Stuart Gerry Brown (New York: Syracuse Univ.

Rahner states clearly that the first principle of ontology is that "the essence of being is knowing and being known is an original unity which we call the (conscious) being-present-to- itself of being." 68 And "in its original concept knowledge is self- possession." 69 The argument is that, while in the cognitive situa- tion there is first both the knower and that which is to be known, in the act of knowledge the subject-object dichotomy is over- come. The "original unity" in being of the subject and object is disclosed. "Anything is known in the measure in which it demon- strates itself to be ontologically identical with the knowing sub- ject." 70 In the act of knowing, being can be said to "possess it- self." 71 Of course it is true that in man's act of knowing there is a certain otherness or "residue" which falls outside the partial unification of subject and object. But, by the same token, Rahner would reply, human knowledge is imperfect knowledge and hence the self-possession of being in man is in itself always incom- plete.72 But, since God knows perfectly, the otherness is over- come, the "ontological difference" removed, and there is in God's knowledge a complete being-present-to-itself and self-possession of Being.73 For Ogden, however, knowledge is a form of social relatedness and hence could better be spoken of as "other-possession" rather than "self-possession." 47 Ogden would be willing to admit, with Hartshorne, that there is an important sense in which the subject- object dichotomy is overcome in the act of knowledge. That would be the sense in which the object is "included" by the sub- ject in cognition. That is, to the extent that Y is known by X, the sum total of experiences that constitute X's being is added to, and to that extent Y can be said to be included within the being of X. Man, of course, is only imperfectly cognizant of a small 68 Hearers of The Word, 39. `9 Ibid. 70 Ibid., 42. 71 Ibid., 43. 72 Ibid., 45ff. 73 Ibid., 49. 7 OGDEN, The Challenge to Protestant Thought, Continuum, Vol. VI, 2 (Sum- mer, 1968), 239f.</page><page sequence="23">RAHNER AND OGDEN 399 portion of the world; hence he can be said to include other reality only in a deficient and incomplete manner. But God knows the world perfectly, hence can be said to include the world within his own being. In this sense it can be said that the subject- object dichotomy is overcome in knowing."75 But there is a sense, however, in which the subject-object dichotomy is not overcome in knowing, whether human or divine. Consider the divine case: in knowing a given world-state, God relates to it and even "in- cludes" it for what it is; it thereby contributes to the self- constitution of God's being. But what precisely there is for God to know and include is a contingent matter. Whatever Y is God knows. But had Y been different or nonexistent, God would have known that too, and the sum total of his knowledge ("experience") would have been different. In this sense the ob- ject known, even in being included, retains its distinctness. In this way it can be said to "transcend" even God.7" And hence, there is a sense in which the subject-object dichotomy is found at the end of the act of knowing as well as at the beginning. Therefore, even in the case of divine knowing, knowledge is other-possession rather than self-possession. The logical issue that is determinative in deciding between knowledge as self-pos- session and other-possession is that of whether or not there is a sense in which the subject-object dichotomy is eliminated or pre- served in the act of cognition. For Rahner, the former seems to be the case; for Ogden, the latter is the case.77 Let us see what difference this sort of decision amounts to. 7SHARTSHORNE, The Divine Relativity (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1947). See also his Philosophers Speak of God, I3Iff. " HARTSHORNE, Philosophical Interrogations, edited by Sydney and Beatrice Row (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1964), 346. " The two ways of understanding knowledge can be traced back to PLATO and ARISTOTLE. For PLATO, knowing involves a confrontation between a subject and an object. PLATO, furthermore, openly admits that this commits him to hold- ing that, even for God, "motion" is involved in knowing. For ARISTOTLE, how- ever, knowing is identity, i.e., being's act of self-possession. But then one might ask how God can know anything other than his necessary essence. See PLATO'S Sophist, in Plato: Collected Dialogues, edited by Edith Hamilton and Huntington Cairns (New York: Bollingen, 1966), 93ff. Also: ARISTOTLE's De Anima, in Intro- duction to Aristotle, edited by Richard McKeon (New York: The Modern Li- brary, Random House, 1947), 145-237, 231. The historical precedent is not sur- prising, considering Aquinas's alignment with Aristotle and Hartshorne's with Plato.</page><page sequence="24">400 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW First, there is the question of conceiving of God's love for man. If we say that the subject-object dichotomy is eliminated (or "overcome") and that God ultimately must be thought of simply as dwelling in the state of self-possession and capable of being described as "being-for-itself," it is difficult to imagine what dif- ference any given creature or any creatures at all could make to him. If knowledge of a sinner repenting or failing to repent does finally affect what God "experiences," then it isn't clear in what sense the subject-object schema is overcome. But then one might say that, while God is not affected by contingent events, he can still be said to love the world's creatures inasmuch as it is by his power that they are given existence, grace, etc. But, in reply, one might wonder if "sharing," "sympathizing," "receiving," etc. are not also indispensable ingredients of love. At any rate, Ogden's neo-classical conception of God allows him to say that God in his love both gives and receives from the creatures. The unique "otherness" of the creature is included within the divine life but in a way as to preserve and treasure its contingent uniqueness.78 Second, the two ways of conceiving of God's knowledge also have another less obvious consequence. For Ogden, all men, by virtue of being men, always already know not only of the existence of God but also of the intimate love of God. That is, since men are aware of God's knowledge of reality (that he knows the real, not what he knows about it) along with their own knowledge of reality, and since for Ogden knowledge is other-possession, men are aware that God is open to them as well as they to God; they are aware of God's sensitive relatedness to themselves. They are aware of God's "divinizing" activity, whereby what men are is taken up into and contributes to the divine life. In short, they are aware of God's love for the world. This does not mean that Ogden claims, any more than does Rahner, that man's co- knowledge of God is initially or inevitably an explicit knowl- edge.79 Nor does he mean that man necessarily responds "au- "7The conceiving of God's love solely in terms of giving is not unique to Catholic theologians, of course.

In fact it is the task of theology to bring to an explicit and thematic level what is initially present to man only in an implicit and unthematic fashion. And Christian theology is based upon the event of Jesus Christ, which is itself the decisive and normative explication and thematization ("re-presentation") of the "original self-disclo- sure" of God, implicit in all of man's judgments."s Rahner's position is very similar and yet subtly and signifi- cantly different. Rahner's position is based upon the traditional distinction between nature and grace. Man, in fact, is for Rahner very much as Ogden has described him: i.e., aware of himself as loved by God. But, in principle, it could have been otherwise. And it is possible to imagine man otherwise. That is, by nature (sans grace) man could know only that he is a creature neces- sarily open to God. In this state, man would be aware only of the existence of God as the ground of intelligibility, etc.: i.e., God as self-possessed. But it is in principle possible that all he could know would be God's silence toward man. In fact, God has elected to love man, and hence man is in a state of grace as well as nature. In fact, all men everywhere can know this gracious- ness of God as it is mediated to them via historical events.8s This position manifests what Rahner would call the "double gratuity" of God's relationship to man. The first is God's decision to create a world at all (he needn't have done so). The second is his de- cision to love that world, once having created it. A person sharing Ogden's position would have a number of objections to Rahner's position. Both revolve around the descrip- tion of God's knowledge as self-possession. First, an Ogdenian would argue that in principle it is impossible to conceive of a man not aware of God's love. That is, if man is defined as a rational creature who must make judgments, and if every judgment must 8o Ibid., 188-205. 81It is true that RAHNER makes the traditional distinction between nature and grace. But in his later writings especially he makes it clear that, while a purely natural (ungraced) man must be postulated as a metaphysical possibility (since God does not owe grace to man), in fact there is no such man nor was there ever. Actual man is always graced man: "Thus always and everywhere history is the history of salvation and of revelation." Theological Dictionary, 411. See also his Nature and Grace: Dilemmas in the Modern Church (New York: Sheed and Ward, 1964).</page><page sequence="26">402 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW necessarily occur within the context of a co-knowledge of God's knowledge, and if we understand God's knowledge to be other- possession, a sympathetic (what does it mean to know something without being sensitive to what it is), receptive sharing, then a man aware of God's knowledge of the world is eo ipso aware of God's love for the world. Second, while one appreciates the force of Rahner's contention that in fact God does love the world and all men can know this, one can wonder how the theologian can coherently combine the idea of God as self-possessed and being- for-itself and the idea of love. One cannot help but regard the marriage of the "God of Aristotle" and the "God of the Sermon on the Mount" as an unstable one at best.s2 That is, it is not clear that one can conceive of a God of love being reconciled with God as being-for-itself.83 Third, it would seem to a follower of Hartshorne and Ogden that the vision of God according to the classical account, as self- possessed and impassible, is incapable of redeeming man. That is, if man's basic sin is some form of self-centeredness (incurva- tus in se), then it would seem that only some sufficient motivation for altruism would be capable of setting him free. But what sort of motivation could one find in an unmovable God, who for all of the talk about his love must ultimately be thought of as being unaffected either by our service or by lack of it? Could one help but think, on such an account, that the only rationally intelligible motive would be to "serve" God so that I may benefit (get a reward and escape punishment)? This is by no means to ques- tion the piety of classical metaphysicians, but it is to ask if their metaphysics, which after all makes God beyond serving, is ade- quate to interpret the love which they practice, a love "which seeketh not her own" (i Cor. 13:5).84 On the other hand, for a neo-classicist, on whose account God's knowledge (and hence reality) is affected by others, it makes quite literal sense to speak 82A. O. LOVEJOY, The Great Chain of Being (New York: Harper and Row, 1960), 6. See also OGDEN, The Reality of God, 51. ' It is clear that RAHNER does not intend that God's eternity entail sheer time- lessness or a static state: Theological Dictionary, 340. It is not clear, however, that he can avoid this conception. 84I find myself to agree with LESLIE DEWART'S criticism of Thomism on this point, if not on others. DEWART speaks of this deficiency of the classical tra- dition as inadvertently promoting a sort of spiritual "hedonism."

Fourth, even if it is assumed that Rahner could coherently reconcile God as being-for-itself with the God of love, it is still a fact that on his account of God's freedom, according to which God need not have created or loved a world at all, God's love seems to be made accidental and not essential to his nature (if the essence of an entity is at least that without which it cannot be conceived). The question then is whether a Christian theolo- gian can accept such an account or whether he is not bound to conceive of God, with Luther and others, as "nothing but love" (eitel Liebe)."8 Of course, Rahner might well reply that God in se is necessarily love; it is only his love ad extra that is con- tingent and accidental. But aside from the question as to whether a being necessary in all respects can be conceived to have con- tingent relations, it remains to be shown that a loving God apart from some creation is thinkable.8" What would a solitary God have to love? One might answer that, in this case, love could exist between the persons of the Trinity. But this seems possible only if we think of the Trinitarian persons as distinct centers of consciousness, as separate individuals, and this seems to resemble tritheism more than traditional Trinitarianism.87 For Ogden, following Hartshorne, God is essentially a God of love and it is conceived as a requirement of that love that God always have a creation to love.88 One can easily imagine Rahner having at least three criticisms of Ogden's position at this point, two philosophical and the other theological. I will describe each and indicate how Ogden might be expected to respond. First, if we say that God's knowledge as other-possession, hence 85OGDEN, The Reality of God, 229. 86 Ibid., I7. 11 In fairness to Catholic theologians it should be noted that the most influential Protestant theologian of this century, KARL BARTH, would side with RAHNER rather than with OGDEN and HARTSHORNE on this issue. See, e.g., BARTH'S Church Dogmatics, II/i (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1957), 257-321. Although BARTH rejects THOMAS' concept of God as "static," etc., he would agree with both THOMAS and RAHNER on this way of conceiving God's freedom, etc. 88 Cf.

The doctrine of creation is possible on this account in the sense of conceiving God as the ground of the world order, but not in the sense of conceiving of a first state of affairs.</page><page sequence="28">404 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW his experience, is in a sense conditioned by what there is to know about another, and that the existence of any given other is con- tingent, then this introduces an element of contingency and change into the divine life."9 Rahner, along with any other clas- sical ontologist, could be expected to criticize the idea of change in God in the following way. He would argue that change, if it is not denigration, is a movement from potency to act (a "reduc- tion"). But, on the principle of sufficient reason, one must as- sume that the ultimate cause of the movement, in order to be the cause, must possess already in act the being toward which the changing entity is moving. If God changes, what cause could possibly fulfill this function? And if God is the cause of change, how could he possibly fail to possess in advance of any change the final term of the change? Ogden, however, following Hart- shorne could reply that God can be the cause of change without already possessing the sum total of being and value that would characterize the world-state once the change would be effected. Hartshorne has tried to show this by seeking to redefine "cause" along the lines of modern statistics and physics, according to which, he thinks, the cause need be no more than adequate an- tecedent conditions; in short, it need not necessitate all the de- tails of its potential effect - only what sort of effect must fol- low, generally speaking. It stimulates certain types of effects and provides a limit within which the effect can occur. But the precise character of the effect is to a degree indeterminate, logi- cally arbitrary, and free. Hence all we must say is that God, as cause of the world's movement, stimulates and guides the change. But the sum of reality, aimed at by the movement, of which God is potentially the final recipient, will be additive and novel, in the sense of bringing with it a genuine contribution to reality and to God himself - something not actual before the change."9 Second, Rahner argues at length that part of man's basic awareness of God as the necessary ground of his being is a con- comitant awareness of one's own contingency. Hence we can infer that there is no necessary reason why we were created: God's ' For a syllogistic statement of this, see HARTSHORNE'S question to JOHN WILD in Philosophical Interrogations, op. cit., 158f. ' See HARTSHORNE, Man's Vision of God, i94f., 255, 275, 306, and especially 246.</page><page sequence="29">RAHNER AND OGDEN 405 act of creation is free.9' But, of course, one could admit that the fact that God created this or that creature is indeed contingent; but it would be the logical error of composition to infer from this that it is a contingent matter as to whether God creates some world or another. An alternative would be to say that it is neces- sary that God create something, but what he creates is contingent. Third, Rahner's theological objection would doubtless be that of asking how the idea of the necessity of God's loving the world could be reconciled with the Christian's belief that God's love is gratuitous, unowed to the creature, a free gift not at man's dis- posal. That is, while Rahner insists as emphatically as anyone could that the only God we know is one who loves the world and that the only world we or anyone else knows or has known is a graced world, he must insist also that this is de facto the case and not de jure. That is, since the "double gratuity" of God's love as expressed in creation and redemption is a free gift, it is in fact gratuitous; it is conceivable that God might not have elected to create or that even given his act of free creation he might have elected not to bestow saving grave upon it. This emphasis upon the freedom of God grows out of the Catholic theologian's con- cern to protect what may surprise the Protestant reader: the doc- trine of sola gratia! For example, Rahner writes: When a man knows through revelation that the Beatific Vision is through grace, and experiences it in his longing for it as a miracle of God's gratuitous love, he has to say that it is a free gift, not due to him by nature, not pledged to him by his creation (so that our crea- tion, which was a free act of God, not due to us, and the free gift of grace to the already existing creature, are not one and the same gift of God's freedom). The concept of "pure nature" is implicit in this statement. It is not just a meaningless extravagance of idle theologi- cal speculation, but it is the necessary background against which to see the Beatific Vision as free grace, not due to us; not due to us either as sinners or as creatures.92 So the question a study of Rahner raises for a theologian such as Ogden concerns the possibility of showing how a necessarily loving God, who by virtue of the nature of love needs a creation 91RAHNER, Hirer des Wortes, IO5-17. "~RAHNER, Nature and Grace, 139.</page><page sequence="30">406 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to be loving, can also be said to love freely, in the sense required by man's experience of grace. If this challenge is to be met at all, the answer would involve analyzing the various senses in which God can be said by the neo-classical theist to be free. In brief, that analysis would show the following. First, the response to the philosophical objection above is apropos here also. While it is necessary that God have some crea- ture to love, no individual creature can say that God's love for him is anything but free. No particular individual is necessary to God. God's love for you or me is gratuitous, unowed, and if we possess it, we do so, not with "boasting," but as a gift due solely to God's contingent decision. Further, if the fact that God loves us is contingent, so also is the form (e.g., a historical covenant) that love may take." Second, there is also a sense in which God's necessary love for some creation can be said to be free. That is, we could follow Plotinus and others and say that inasmuch as an act springs spontaneously from one's own nature, inasmuch as it is not ex- ternally forced and hence does not violate but fulfills one's own being, then that act is a free act, whether it is in itself contingent or necessary. For example, given Luther's nature, it was inevi- table that he say, "I can do no other"; yet at the same time Luther would probably say that in the moment of that utterance and deed he was perfectly free. In this sense we could conclude that the necessity of God's creating and loving some world is both necessary and free. Finally, whether man's experience of grace as a gift requires him to conceive of God's freedom in ways other than the two sketched above may perhaps be determined by further discussion. I submit in the meantime that these senses, derived from the neo-classical position, are consistent with a co- herent view of both God's freedom and his love. In conclusion, we have seen that Rahner and Ogden are in basic agreement on the fundamental issue of theological method. We have also seen that their basic difference is to be found in the way the God known according to this method is to be conceived. The difference is not to be minimized.

The striking discovery, to my mind, however, is the remarkable similarity in approach that exists between the German Jesuit and the American Protestant, who have developed their positions independently of each other.</page></plain_text>
