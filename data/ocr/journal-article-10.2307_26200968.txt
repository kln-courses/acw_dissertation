Wasserstrom, Maurice A. Pomerantz, and J. Vahid Brown for commenting on an earlier draft of this article. Any shortcomings in the article are due to me. 1 The most notable and systematic remains Majid Khadduri's The Islamic Conception of Justice (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1984). Given how little scholarly attention Islamic conceptions of justice have received, it is not surprising that Khadduri's book is primarily descriptive. After surveying various conceptions of justice in almost all dimensions of Muslim scholarship, Khadduri concludes that Muslims 'maintain that a "higher" standard of justice must be found, consisting of a higher order of norms and virtues which man kind aspires to realize on Earth' and that 'the debate on justice never really completely stopped' among Muslims (pp. 227-8). See also, two works by Lawrence Rosen, The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989) and The Justice of Islam: Comparative Perspectives on Islamic Law and Society (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999). 2 For a bibliography of these works, see Patricia Crone, God's Rule: Government and Islam (New York: Columbia University Press, 2004), 414—46. 3 In Arabic, the words most often used to refer to justice are 'adl and its semantic variant, 'addla. Qist and insdf are also used to refer to justice, but, more specifically, they connote 'equity'. Other words, such as mizan ('scale' or 'balance'), and haqq ('truth', 'reality', 'rightness', or 'desert'), depending on the context in which they are used, could also be translated as 'justice.'

KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI theology (kalam), was more concerned with shaping individual epis temologies than affecting political institutions. In a brief but learned article on conceptions of political justice in early Islam, Franz Rosenthal commented indirectly on the dearth of scholar ship on Islamic conceptions of justice by observing that theoretical conceptions of justice were for the most part irrelevant in Muslim societies. However, he cautioned that, this seeming lack of interest must not be mistaken for a lack of concern, among Muslims in general, with the tremendous practical importance of justice and injustice in human political and social affairs. On the contrary, the existence of justice and the need for it in order to maintain any social organism was taken so much for granted that except in restricted philosophical circles, no further, more profound study of the problem of justice was felt to be required. In what follows, I build on Rosenthal's observation and seek to show that in the influential works of 'Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415/1024-5) and Ibn al-Baqillani (d. 403/1013) conceptions of justice were founded on theories of knowledge that gave prominent place to intuitions and internal human experiences. For these two mutakallims ('scholastic theologians'), justice was not an abstract ideal but rather a matter of everyday knowledge. Their inquiries into what is just were thus built on expositions of how an individual knows and how individual epistemol ogies define humans' relation to God, the world, and one another. 'Abd al-Jabbar and Ibn al-Baqillani presumed that individuals decide what is ethical on the basis of how they interpret their intuitions and internal experiences in relation to God. 'Abd al-Jabbar interpreted intuitions and internal experiences as divine creations embedded in human nature as a means of deciphering what is good (hasan) or just (adl). He thus defined justice as a type of necessary knowledge (ilm daruri). Ibn al-Baqillani, on the other hand, interpreted intuitions and internal experiences as ethically neutral creations of God that Arabic word primarily used by ' Abd al-Jabbar and Ibn al-Baqillanl in their writings on justice. In their general discussions of justice, they interchange 'adl with qist, 'adala, and insaf, without making significant conceptual distinction between them. However, since it is counted among 'the most Beautiful Names' (,al-asma al-husna), in their discussions of divine names and attributes al-adl is the only term they use. 4 Franz Rosenthal, 'Political Justice and the Just Ruler', Israel Oriental Studies 10 (1980), 101. s As will become clear in the body of this article, I use intuition to refer to 'Abd al-Jabbar's and Ibn al-Baqillanl's conceptions of 'necessary knowledge' (ilm daruri) and "Abd al-Jabbar's distinct understanding of'aql.</page><page sequence="3">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 73 evidence humans' utter dependence on their Creator. He thus concluded that only God knows what is just and that justice is whatever God commands. Neither 'Abd al-Jabbar nor Ibn al-Baqillanl developed a systematic theory of social or political justice; rather, they sought to effect justice in society by affecting the way individuals interpret their intuitions and internal experiences in relation to God. Since intuitive knowledge is located in the individual, the individual—rather than political and social institutions—was the primary unit through which they analysed justice in society. For this reason 'Abd al-Jabbar placed great emphasis upon the dissemination of knowledge by teaching proper methods of reflection (nazar): Know that what is entailed by the religious obligations of the religiously obligated person (taklif al-mukallaf) is divided into two parts. One of them is knowledge (ilm), the other is action (amal)... As for action, it is of two kinds. The first is to teach (ta'lim) and expend every effort in it. One should persevere in doing this as though it were possible to enable the one being given knowledge of the principles of religion (usul al-din) to become someone else and to take his [the teacher's] place. However, this is unfeasible. What is certainly feasible is to explain the method of reflection (na^ar) in the previously-mentioned ways. His [the teacher's] task in this almost impossible undertaking is like the task of the repentant (td'ib) who, when it is impossible for him to undo the sin he has already committed, repents in a particular way, having another act take its place. There is no position greater than the [following] two positions: to attain realization of this knowledge [discussed in al-Mughnt\ and then to disseminate (bathth) and make it manifest (izhdr) to the greatest extent possible.6 For 'Abd al-Jabbar, the effect of religious action (amal) was not to be attained through social or political institutions, but through the act of teaching individuals to think, and to do so in the most intimate fashion so as to impart to the student all that is in the teacher's mind. Although a similar statement is not found in Ibn al-Baqillanl's extant writings, the fact that he, like 'Abd al-Jabbar, argued for what is just by examin ing individual intuitions and internal experiences suggests that he too believed that affecting the way individuals reflect upon their experiences is a form of religious work (amal) in society. Before beginning my analysis of 'Abd al-Jabbar's and Ibn al-Baqillanl's conceptions of justice, I should address an objection that may be raised 6 Abu 1-Hasan 'Abd al-Jabbar, al-Mughni ft abwab al-tawhid wa-l-'adl (Cairo: Mu'assasat al-Misriyya al-'Amma li-l-Ta'lTf wa-l-Tarjama wa-l-Tiba'a wa-l-Nashr, 1960-68), xx. n. 254-5.</page><page sequence="4">74 KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI to my reading of early kalam texts to understand the significance of justice in Muslim society (in this case, the society under Buyid rule). It is often argued that discussions of justice in works of kalam have little to do with social and political justice and that they are concerned exclusively with justice ('adl) as an attribute of God. This is true, if we read these texts, as Rosenthal did, for systematic theories of social or political justice. However, such a reading overlooks the fact that the notion that God is just has not been a subject of controversy in Islam. Indeed, Muslims unanimously agree that God is just and good; as Ibn al-Baqillanl reminds us, whoever believes that God is not always just and good cannot be considered a Muslim.7 What made discussions of divine justice controversial and worthy of theological analysis in early Islam were the implications that varying conceptions of justice as a divine attribute held for order in society. For this reason, one could fruitfully mine discussions of 'adl in kalam for insights into the social and political significance of conceptions of justice in early Islam. Different conceptions of justice played a crucial role in the sectarian differentia tions made in early Islamic history. Insofar as people were believed to be individually responsible for their actions, the way in which they determined how to act justly also determined the degree to which people of opposing views were willing to accept them into the Muslim community as individuals capable of acting justly. BIOGRAPHICAL BACKGROUNDS 'Abd al-Jabbar and Ibn al-Baqillanl were the main proponents of their respective schools of scholastic theology—Basran Mu'tazilism and Ash'arism—during their lifetime. They were contemporaries and both served as judges under Buyid rule. Abu 1-Hasan 'Abd al-Jabbar al-Hamadhanl al-Asadabadl's al-Mughni fl abwab al-tawhld wa-l- adl ('That which makes suffice in discussions of divine unicity and justice'), which is my source for his thought, is our richest extant source for Basran Mu'tazili theology. 'Abd al-Jabbar was born some time between 320/932 and 325/937 in Asadabad, a town located slightly southwest of Hamadhan (Iran). He was best known by his administrative title, qadi al-qudab ('the Chief Judge') for the region encompassing Rayy, Qazwin, Abhar-Zanjan, Suhraward, Qum, 7 Abu Bakr b. al-Baqillanl, Kitab al-Tamhid (ed.

' Abbad (d. 385/995).8 He died around 415/1024-5. Abu Bakr Muhammad b. al-Baqillanl's9 date of birth is not known, though most likely it was within the second quarter of the fourth/tenth century. We do know that he was born and raised in Basra. At one point he joined the court of the Buyid prince 'Adud al-Dawla (d. 372/983). For later traditionalists, the fact that he worked for the Buyids, who were Shi'i, was a source of concern. Al-QadI 'Iyad (d. 544/1149), in his biography of Ibn al-Baqillani, mentions that when his teachers refused to join 'Adud al-Dawla's court because, as Daylami Shi'is (rawafid), they were considered to be among the unbelievers and the religiously corrupt, he said to them: This is what Ibn Kullab, al-Muhasibl and others from that time said—'[The caliph] al-Ma'mun is a sinner (fasiq). We will not attend his court.' As a result, he sent away for Ahmad b. Hanbal, and everyone knows what happened to him.10 Had they debated him, they would have turned him away from 8 On Sahib, see Yaqut b. 'Abd Allah al-Ruml, Mu jam al-udaba (n.p.: Dar al-Fikr, 1980), vi. 168-317; Clifford E. Bosworth, The Mediaeval Islamic Underworld: The Banu Sdsdn in Arabic Society and Literature (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1976), i. 60f.; Charles Pellat, 'Al-Sahib Ibn 'Abbad' in Julia Ashtiany et al. (eds.) 'Abbasid Belles-Lettres, 96-111; and Claude Cahen and Charles Pellat, 'Ibn 'Abbad', EI2. 9 Ancient biographies of Ibn al-Baqillanl differ in their attribution of the nickname (laqab) baqillani, to Abu Bakr Muhammad. Some of them say that he was known as al-Baqillanl ('the grocer'): for example, Abu 1-'Abbas Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Abl Bakr b. Khallikan, Wafayat al-a'ydn wa-anba abna al-zaman, ed. Muhammad Muhyl al-DIn 'Abd al-Hamld (Cairo: Maktabat al-Nahda al-Misriyya, 1948), 269; and 'Abd al-Hayy b. Ahmad b. al-'Imad, Shadharat al-dhahab fi akhbdr man dhahab (Cairo: Matba'at al-QudsI, 1931), iii. 168. Others say he was known as Ibn al-Baqillanl ('the son of the grocer'): for example, Abu Bakr Ahmad b. 'All al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl, Ta'rikh Baghdad (Cairo: Maktabat al-Khanji, 1931), 379; 'All b. al-Hasan b. 'Asakir, Tabyin kadhib al-muftari fi ma nusiba ila l-imam Abi l-Hasan al-Asb'ari (Damascus: al-QudsI, 1347/1928), 217; and 'Iyad b.

In modern times, he is mostly referred to as al-Baqillanl, but because he is recalled as Ibn al-Baqillanl in the earlier biographies and because there is no indication that he himself was ever a grocer, I refer to him by what was most likely his nickname, Ibn al-Baqillanl. 10 This is a reference to the mihna ('inquisition') that was led by the caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833) to establish as orthodoxy the Mu'tazilT doctrine that the</page><page sequence="6">76 KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI this matter.

"With this passionate speech, he gained the consent of his teacher: 'If God has opened your bosom to this, go!'11 In an effort presumably to inform his Buyid patron of correct beliefs, Ibn al-Baqillani wrote al-Tambid ft l-radd 'ala l-mulhida al-muattila wa-l-rafida wa-l-khawarij wa-l-mu tazila ('Laying out the refutation of the atheist heretics, the Shi'a, the Kharajis, and the Mutazila'),12 which is my source for his conception of justice. Al-Tamhid, along with Ibn Furaq's (d. 406/1015) Mujarrad maqalat al-shaykb Abi l-Hasan al-Ash'ari, are to date the most important sources for the early historical development of Ash'arism after the death of its eponym, Abu 1- Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 324/935-6). At some point, after joining the court of ' Adud al-Dawla, Ibn al-Baqillani must have been appointed a judge because, in the classical sources, he is often referred to simply as 'the Judge' (al-qadi). He died in 403/1013 in Baghdad. CABD AL-JABBAR'S CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE The first part of the sixth volume of al-Mugbni contains' Abd al-Jabbar's discussion of justice and its determination ('adl and ta'dil). It begins with Qur'an is the created word of God. For a brief discussion of the mihna, see Martin Hinds, 'al-Mihna', EI2. 11 'Iyad b. Musa, Tartlb al-madarik wa-taqrib al-masdlik, 246-7. 12 There are two scholarly editions of al-Tambid. The first was published in Egypt in 1947 by Mahmud Muhammad al-Khudayri and Muhammad 'Abd al-Hadi Abu RIdah, under the above-mentioned title. This edition was based on a single manuscript. About a quarter of this edition of al-Tamhid is devoted to the question of imama or leadership. The second edition was done by Joseph McCarthy and published in Lebanon in 1957 under the title Kitab al-Tamhid. McCarthy used two additional manuscripts that were not available to al-Khudayri and Abu RIdah. His edition supplies a significant section of Ibn al-Baqillam's theological discussion that is missing from the Egyptian edition, but it omits the latter's discussion of imama ('leadership'). (For McCarthy's reasons for omitting the section on imama, see his preface.) Since I do not deal with Ibn al-Baqillanl's conception of imama in this article, my references to al-Tamhid, unless otherwise stated, are to McCarthy's edition.</page><page sequence="7">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 77 a definition of an act (fi'l), which foregrounds 'Abd al-Jabbar's discussion of justice as an attribute (sifa) of an act rather than an abstract ideal. This indicates not only how deontic but also personalistic13 and practical his conception of justice is. 'Abd al-Jabbar defines an act as follows: Know that what is meant by our description of an act as an act (fi'l) is that it is found occurring from an agent (fail) capable of exercising power over it (qadir 'alay-h), and everyone who knows it as such knows it as an act of his. Whoever does not know it in this manner does not know it as an act. (al-Mughni, vi. I. 5) 'Abd al-Jabbar's definition of an act draws an essential connection between the agent of an act and her ability to perform the act. This is significant for understanding 'Abd al-Jabbar's conception of justice because, as we shall see, he argues that the justness of an act is deter mined by whether its agent deserves praise for performing it or blame for failing to perform it. Justice is thus not an ideal for which one strives but rather a practical aspect of everyday action. Categories of acts 'Abd al-Jabbar divides acts into two broad categories: acts that carry no attribute (i.e., they are neither good nor bad) and acts that carry an attribute, such as goodness or badness. Neutral acts 'have no attribute over and above their existence... e.g., the acts of a person who is 13 Based on studies of religious courts in rural Morocco, Lawrence Rosen has argued that justice in Islam is 'personalistic'. It is not a fixed ideal that underpins social institutions or relations; rather, it is an ideal arrived at through personal negotiations that take place within the parameters of what is culturally and religiously accepted as permissible. This function of justice, he has further argued, reflects the general way in which Arab Muslim culture functions. The metaphor he used to describe this culture is the bazaar in which all prices are negotiable and only fixed on a case-by-case basis through the personal interchange of the buyer and the merchant. (See Rosen, Anthropology of Justice, esp. pp. 17 and 21; 'Justice in Islamic Culture and Law' in Ravindra S. Khare (ed.) Perspectives on Islamic Law, Justice, and Society (Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 1999), 33-52; Justice of Islam, esp. 154-60.) My reading of 'Abd al-Jabbar and Ibn al-Baqillanl suggests a different interpretation. For them the individual is the primary social unit through which justice is realized in society. Justice is nonetheless a universal concept that underpins their particular conceptions of God and God's relation to humanity. Their emphasis on the centrality of the individual for how justice is religiously conceived and sought in society should not be construed to mean, as Rosen would have it, that justice is a negotiated reality in Muslim societies.</page><page sequence="8">78 KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI unaware (sabin) or asleep (nd'im)'. 'Abd al-Jabbar describes the value of acts as an attribute over and above the existence of the act (zaida 'ala wujudi-hi) by means of which we necessarily or intuitively know whether or not the agent of the act deserves blame (dhamm) (al-Mughni, vi. i. 7). Acts that carry attributes are divided into two further categories— good (hasan) acts and bad (qablh)14 acts. Bad acts are acts whose agents are necessarily known to deserve blame when they perform the act deliberately and of their own freewill.15 Using lying (kidhb) and injustice (%ulm), which he defines (al-Mugbm, xiii. 298) as undue harm inflicted on others, as his examples, 'Abd al-Jabbar defines bad acts thus: It is necessarily known (bi-idtirar) that a lie, which entails no benefit and does not repel a harm (darar) greater than itself, and a harm, which entails no benefit and does not repel a harm greater than itself and is not deserved nor is thought to be deserved, when performed by one free and legally competent (al-qadir al-mukballd), makes him deserving of blame so long as nothing prevents it. And we expressed that whatever has this state (hal) is bad, and by this expression we mean that this entitative ground (mana)16 is in it (al-Mughni, vi. I. 18). 'Abd al-Jabbar defines good acts as acts whose agents do not deserve blame: Know that it is necessarily known that an act that occurs in a way in which its agent does not deserve blame by doing it, if he knows that its occurrence in this way is not blameworthy, is described as good', (ibid, 31). Bad acts, unlike good acts, are not subdivided, because even though in Islamic jurisprudence distinctions are made between divinely forbidden acts (baram) and reprehensible acts (makrub), ethically speaking, all bad acts should be avoided, regardless of their status in Islamic law.17 14 Scholars have differed in regard to the English translation of qabih, because qabih denotes both ugliness and moral wrongness or evil; see Margaretha T. Heemskerk, Suffering in Mu'tazilite Theology: 'Abd al-Jabbar's Teaching on Pain and Divine Justice (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2000), 113-14. I translate qabih as 'bad' because the word bad, in English, could be used to make both moral and aesthetic judgments in a way similar (though admittedly not identical) to the use of qabih in Arabic. 15 For a fuller discussion of the goodness and badness of acts in 'Abd al-Jabbar's thought, see George Hourani, Islamic Rationalism: The Ethics of 'Abd al-Jabbdr (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), 37-128. 16 'Abd al-Jabbar's technical use of ma'na as an 'entitative ground' will be explained below in the section on ''Abd al-Jabbar's Conception of Knowledge'. 17 For a comparison of Abd al-Jabbar's categories of acts with those used in Islamic jurisprudence, see Hourani, Islamic Rationalism, 43—4.</page><page sequence="9">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 79 Good acts, however, are distinguished from one another, because the goodness of breathing differs ethically from the goodness of acting justly. Among good acts 'Abd al-Jabbar (ibid) generally distinguishes permis sible (mubah), commended (nadb and tafaddul), and obligatory acts (wajib). Permissible acts are those whose agents are necessarily known not to deserve blame (e.g., breathing); as such, they could be considered as mere good acts. A recommended act is necessarily known to be 'a good [act] that has an attribute over and above its goodness by which its agent deserves praise (madb), such as beneficence (ibsan)', but the omission of commended acts, such as supererogatory acts of worship (nawafil), are necessarily known not to deserve blame (ibid, 37). 'Abd al-Jabbar cites insaf ('fairness' or 'equity') as an example of the third category of good acts—obligatory acts (wajib). Obligation is a value over and above the goodness and praiseworthiness of an act. An act is obligatory, according to 'Abd al-Jabbar, when it is necessarily known that 'if it is undertaken by an agent he deserves praise and if not undertaken he deserves blame' (ibid, 43). 'Abd al-Jabbdr's definition of justice Following discussion of the place of just acts in the context of acts in general, 'Abd al-Jabbar offers this definition of justice: Know that the act which is distinguished by this attribute (sifa) [i.e.,'adl\ is every act that is done either to benefit (yantafi ) or harm (yadurr) the recipient of the act in a way (wajh) that is good (yahsun). As for what a doer (fail) among us does to benefit himself or to repel harm from himself, it is not described as such. Therefore, it is not said that Zayd by eating or drinking or doing what is religiously obligatory (wajib) or commended (nadb) is being just. When he benefits or harms someone else in a way that is good, it is said that he is being just to him and that what he did was just. For this reason, it is not said that a judge acted justly between the adversaries unless what he did to them was good and equitable (insafan), by effecting either a benefit or harm, (ibid, 48) It may seem odd that 'Abd al-Jabbar's definition of justice assumes that assessing the goodness of a harm or benefit brought to others is not subject to dispute, when this is precisely the vexing question of ethics. For 'Abd al-Jabbar, as seen above, the goodness and badness of acts, their praiseworthiness or blameworthiness, are all matters known necessarily (■bi-ilm daruri) through intuition. 'Abd al-Jabbar, like most scholastic theologians of his time, divided knowledge into two broad categories: necessary (daruri) and acquired (muktasab). Necessary knowledge is knowledge that is indisputable and immediately known by all compos mentis individuals. As such, no one</page><page sequence="10">8o KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI can explain why something is known necessarily; knowledge that is explainable can be acquired. Since the necessity of necessary knowl edge cannot be explained, its content can only be communicated by listing what constitutes it. 'Abd al-Jabbar does this by dividing the content of necessary knowledge into two categories: knowledge that is necessarily known by a means (tarlq) and knowledge that is necessarily known without a means. What we know by a means is knowledge of particulars (mufassal) gained through perception (idrak), either through the senses or by finding ourselves (wujida anfusana) in a particular state at a particular time, such as finding oneself in the state of being willing at the moment one wills to do something or the state of reflecting when one reflects upon something. Necessary knowledge that is gained without a means is known through intuition (aql), and it is generaliz able (mujmal). As examples of this type of necessary knowledge, 'Abd al-Jabbar lists (ibid, xii. 66) knowledge of the rules of logic (e.g., two contradictory statements cannot both be true) and knowledge of ethical attributes of acts (e.g., injustice (?«/ra) and lying are bad). 'Abd al-Jabbar's categorization of ethical knowledge as intuitive knowledge begs further inquiry into his epistemology and is significant for establishing the personalistic nature of his conception of justice. As we shall see below, intuition (aql) and perception (idrak), for 'Abd al-Jabbar, are creations of God in humans that obligate them to God (taklif). As such, when 'Abd al-Jabbar says one intuitively knows the goodness or badness of an act, he gives divine validation to individual intuitions and internal feelings involved in making such a judgment, and in this way he universalizes his personal intuitions of the nature of the God-human relationship. 'Abd al-Jabbar's conception of knowledge 'Abd al-Jabbar defines knowledge as follows: Know that knowledge (ilmls) is an entitative ground (ma'na) which necessitates (yaqtadi) tranquillity in the self (sukiin al-nafs) of the knower in regard to what he has considered (ma tandwalah). As such, it is distinct from everything else. This ma'na [i.e., knowledge] would not be distinguished by this assessment (hukm) unless it was a conviction (itiqad19) that in a distinct way (wajb) 18 In 'Abd al-Jabbar's theology, there is no substantive difference between the two Arabic terms most often used to refer to knowledge: 'ilm and ma'rifa. While some Muslim thinkers, in particular Sufis, use ma'rifa to refer specifically to experiential knowledge of the divine, 'Abd al-Jabbar explicitly states that he uses the two terms synonymously. See al-Mughni, xii. 16. 19 On the translation of itiqad as 'conviction' in this context and in Mu'tazill texts in general, see J. R. T. M. Peters, God's Created Speech: A Study in the</page><page sequence="11">EPiSTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 8l convinced one of itself in accordance with what it actually is (aid ma huiva bi-hi waqi). (ibid, 13) ' Abd al-Jabbar's definition of knowledge, through the notion of ma'na, ontologically relates the world outside of humans to internal experiences of 'conviction' and 'tranquillity of the self'. Ma'na literally signifies 'meaning' in Arabic, but it has a technical definition in Mu'tazilT theology. As Richard Frank has argued, ma'na in Mu'tazilT theology signifies 'the intrinsic causal determinant of a thing being-so'.20 In short, as suggested by George Hourani, ma'na could be rendered into English as a 'ground' or, as I prefer, an 'entitative ground' for the attributes and characteristics of a thing.21 According to 'Abd al-Jabbar, the mana of our knowledge of a thing, though not equivalent to the reality of the thing, corresponds to it as it really is. The ma'na of what is known (ma'lum) thus relates humans to the world or the cosmos outside of them by exercising a real influence that is perceived in the self as conviction (i tiqad) and tranquillity (sukun al-nafs) when one knows something or, more accurately, feels confident in knowing something. As such, through the notion of ma'na, 'Abd al-Jabbar ontologically universalizes as knowledge an individual's internal experience of being convinced of something to the point of feeling tranquil and self-assured. While in 'Abd al-Jabbar's epistemology the notion of ma'na relates humans to the cosmos ontologically, intuition and perception relate humans to God religiously, or more specifically in terms of their obliga tion to obey God (taklif). In 'Abd al-Jabbar's epistemology, God is the creator of perception (idrak) and intuition (aql), which guarantees the validity of these personal experiences as generalizable sources of knowledge. We have explained previously that if one is able to perceive (mudrik) and intuit ('aqil) and if there is no outstanding doubt regarding the perceived object, perception is the way of knowledge. We also explained that perception is unavoidable. It is said that knowledge is generated,22 but since it is impossible Speculative Theology of the Mutazili qadi l-quddt Abu l-Hasan 'Abd al-Jabbdr bin Ahmad al-Hamaddni (Leiden: E. J.

Our perception also makes us aware of our internal states (,baly, for example, we perceive ourselves in a state of knowing, reflecting, or willing. Knowledge gained through perception, however, cannot be attributed to our senses alone. If we rely solely on our eyes, for example, we would have to conclude that the sun is the size of a soccer ball. How do we intuitively know to factor distance into what our eyes perceive? We do so because of the 'aql that God created in us. 'Aql is usually translated as 'the intellect' or 'reason', but it has a more specific meaning in Mu tazili theology. In 'Abd al-Jabbar's thought, 'aql does not correspond to what we normally associate with the intellect or reason.23 He states that it is not a substance (jawhar) nor to "Abd al-Jabbar perception does not generate knowledge. Basing myself especially on the text of Mughrii IV (e.g., pp. 50-58), I suggest [reading] here instead of yamtam: bi-ma'na.' Peters accordingly translated the passage as follows: 'We explained that perception is not a ma'na, in which case one could say that it generates knowledge; and (we explained also) that it cannot be generated by the soundness (sihha) of the eye ' (God's Created Speech, 94). Marie Bernand agreed with this and said that she had independently made the same correction to the original, edited text: 'Nous avons, en effet, montrĕ que la perception (idrak) n'est pas un ma'na, c'est-a-dire qu'on ne peut affirmer qu'elle est gĕnĕratrice [de science]. Elle ne peut engendrer la science ni du fait de l'integrite de l'oeil...' (Le probleme de la connaissance, 160). My translation takes into consideration, and indeed addresses, the problem raised by Peters and Bernand in regard to the printed text. However, I have resisted their emendation because if we follow it, it requires us to understand from what follows in the original ('[.. .]wa anna-hu la yajuzu kawnu-hu mutawalladan 'an sihhati l-'ayn') that idrak could have a kawn ('a mode of being'), when this is clearly not the case. The presence of kawnu-hu here indicates that it is knowledge that cannot be generated from the soundness of the eye. That is, there has to be some connection between the fact that we have a sound eye and the fact that we have knowledge of our seeing. This connection is perception, and it results from God's doing. 23 See the discussion in A.

He writes: 'Aql is a term referring to an aggregate of specific knowledges (al- ulum al-makhsiisa).24 When they occur in a religiously obligated individual (mukallaf), his reflections, reason, and undertaking what he has been religiously obligated to do are sound (sahha min-hu l-nazar wa-l-istidlal wa-l-qiyam bi-adai ma kullifa). (ibid, 375) 'Aql is a set of a priori known things that are found in compos mentis persons that allow them to discern and thus become subject to religious obligations. As such, 'aql in 'Abd al-Jabbar's thought closely resembles what is meant by 'intuition'25 or 'common sense'26 in English. Once 'Abd al-Jabbar has established that our perceptions and intuitions originate from God, he asks, why would God create them in us? He answers this question mainly through his theory of khdtir or 'incidental thought.' Khdtir is another common Arabic word that carries a great deal of significance in 'Abd al-Jabbar's theology as a technical term. Literally, khdtir is a thought that occurs to an individual uninten tionally but in relation to something or for some purpose.27 According to 'Abd al-Jabbar, khdtir occurs in humans as an act of God; therefore, like necessary knowledge, there is no doubting it. Unlike necessary knowledge, however, we need to reflect on it in order to distinguish it from seemingly similar internal experiences such as 'talk within the self' (.hadith al-nafs)28 and 'diabolical whisperings' (waswasa) (ibid, xii. 412). The purpose of the khdtir is to warn us mainly for the sake of self preservation (daf u l-darar 'an nafsi-h). The khdtir points to the harm that may come to us from something. It explains, for instance, why we fear death or being mauled by a lion, when we have no actual experience of these events. It, more importantly, acts as a motivator for action. 24 Reading al-makhsusa for makhsusa. 25 Peters, God's Created Speech, 82. 26 Reinhart, Before Revelation, 152. 27 A useful definition given in Edward Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon is: 'A cognition which bestirs itself, or occurs, in the mind, with a view to the end, issue or result, of a thing'. Ibn Manzur in Lisan al- Arab defines it as 'what occurs in the heart by way of direction or command {ma yakhturu ft l-qalbi min tadbirin aw amr)\ 28 hadith al-nafs is a form of mental speech; it is what one silently hears within oneself.' Abd al-Jabbar does not define it.

In religious terms, the khatir warns us of the divine blame and punishment that our wrongdoings will earn us even though we might not see (our) wrong doing punished or blamed in the here and now.29 As such, the khatir motivates (da in) us to look for God and to act ethically and fulfil our religious duties. [Since] the obligation to reflect to know God follows upon the fear (khaivf) of not doing so and since this fear is necessarily a fear of the harms connected to religion (din), such as punishment, sin, etc., and since this matter is not arranged in the 'aql of the compos mentis person as a result of habit ('dda)... then there has to be a sign (amdra) that occurs inside him for him to fear them thus necessitating him to reflect. This sign is the warning (tanbih) of the motivator (al-da't) or the incidental thought (al-khatir). (ibid, 386-7) The 'incidental thought' is not something humans learn through habit or experience, like a craft. Rather, it is a sign that incites fear of divine punishment internally, thus obligating humans to reflect upon themselves and the world in order to attain knowledge of religious duties so as to avoid divine punishment for disobedience. Given this significance of reflection (nagar), 'Abd al-Jabbar concludes that God obligates humanity to reflect and to acquire knowledge (ibid, 487). Given what we know through the khatir about the necessity of reflection for self-preservation, 'Abd al-Jabbar also concludes that the divine obligation of reflection and knowledge is a good act in the sense that it brings about goodness (ibid, 492f.). Thus, humans ought to accept it rationally and willingly. We know that the religiously obligated person (mukallaf), when he reflects, gains cognition ('arafa) of divine unicity and justice (al-tawhid wa-l-adl) and knows that he deserves blame and punishment for disobedience and praise and reward for obedience [to God] and that he deserves these through the power of God—who is sublime and essentially powerful (qadir li-nafsi-h)—for whom it is impossible to be prevented from doing what rightfully deserves to be done (la yajuzu an yumna a min fili l-mustahaqq). Therefore, he [the mukallaf] is more likely to choose obedience and to eschew disobedience because of what 29 Given the role of 'incidental thought' in 'Abd al-Jabbar's theology as a thought that warns us for the purposes of self-preservation, Peters translates kbatir as 'warning' (God's Created Speech, 63-65). See also Reinhart, Before Revelation, 156-7, where kbatir is translated as 'the Warner'. By translating kbatir based on the role "Abd al-Jabbar sees it playing rather than the meaning of the word in Arabic, these scholars obscure its significance for the way in which 'Abd al-Jabbar develops his theology of internal human experiences.</page><page sequence="15">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 85 he knows in regard to the benefit and the harm found in the states of obedience and disobedience respectively. Thus, according to what we have explained, God's necessitating (may He be praised) these cognitions (ma arif) as graces (altaf) has to be a good act. (ibid, 493) In this summary of the purpose of human knowledge and reflection, we find that * Abd al-Jabbar's epistemology ultimately culminates in a view of the essential situation of human beings to be that of religiously obligated persons who stand before an All-Powerful, Just, and Gracious God. This is learned through reflection, which is incited by our incidental thoughts (khatir), and facilitated by human intuition ('aql). From 'Abd al-Jabbar's point of view, there is no doubting this understanding of the world (i.e., of God and the cosmos) because it is validated through a personal conviction and a self-assured tranquillity that as he shows through his deontology, conforms to the reality of things as they are. Understanding 'Abd al-Jabbar's epistemology allows us to appreciate how personalistic his conception of justice is. Goodness and badness, and by extension justice and injustice, for 'Abd al-Jabbar, are intuitively known. That is, we intuitively know whether or not an act that harms or benefits another does so in a way that is good or bad, and thus praiseworthy to undertake or blameworthy if not undertaken. For 'Abd al-Jabbar, such ethical assessments are forms of necessary knowledge and in fact necessarily elude explanation. They are universally and imme diately known by all compos mentis persons. The validity of intuitive ethical assessments are doubly assured—first, as divine creations which, along with the khatir, guide humans toward their religious obligations and, second, as internal experiences of conviction and self-assured tranquillity experienced through the ma'nd of a known thing when one feels like one truly knows. 'Abd al-Jabbar believed in the universality and verity of his intuitions of what is good and just to such an extent that he asserted that whoever opposes them is lying. There is no need to engage them in a discussion; rather, he wrote (ibid, 42): 'We only need to strive to remove their morally corruptive denials' (yajibu an najtahida fi izalati-hi'an al-inkar al-fasid). This statement is evidence for the sectarianism of those theologians who defined the 'rightful' Muslim community (umma) according to their theology (kalam). 'Abd al-Jabbar viewed those who, 30 "Abd al-Jabbar defines grace as 'that on account of which an acting agent (fail) is more likely to perform [what he or she is obligated to perform], even if he does not choose to perform the act because of another [personal] objective (.gharad). This [his not performing the act] does not preclude it from being a grace' (al-Mughni, xii. 493).</page><page sequence="16">86 KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI like Ibn al-Baqillanl, opposed his theological understandings as sources of moral corruption (fasad) in society. Similarly, Ibn al-Baqillanl regarded his Mu'tazill opponents as: 'the sect (firqa) most harmful to this Muslim community (umma) and the most insolent of sects with respect to God.'31 IBN AL-BAQILLANI'S CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE Ibn al-Baqillanl rejects 'Abd al-Jabbar's notions that justice is known intuitively and that the ethical attributes of acts are ontologically deter mined. He advocates divine subjectivism, arguing that justice and goodness can only be determined through the divine commands revealed to humanity. We condemn most fervently the notion that the 'aql32 by itself is a way to knowledge of the badness (ijubh) or goodness (husn) of an act or its prohibition, permissibility or obligatoriness. We say that these assessments (hukm) are all only proven by the revealed religion (al-shar ), without any consideration of the 'aql. (al-Tamhid, 105) Despite his differences with 'Abd al-Jabbar, Ibn al-BaqillanT's concep tion of justice, like 'Abd al-Jabbar's, is personalistic. Like 'Abd al-Jabbar, Ibn al-Baqillanl does not discuss justice as a theoretical ideal but as an attribute of an act. Unlike 'Abd al-Jabbar, he does not view justice as an intrinsic attribute of an act but rather as an attribute ascribed to acts by divine commandments and prohibitions (in other words, by Islamic Law). Also, like 'Abd al-Jabbar, Ibn al-Baqillani's conception of justice is founded upon his understanding of what constitutes necessary knowl edge and intuition. For him too, necessary knowledge is a divine creation that directly links humans to God, but he interprets this divine crea tion differently. While 'Abd al-Jabbar argues that necessary knowledge is proof that God has created in humans the innate ability to know and reflect, Ibn al-Baqillanl finds in necessary knowledge proof of humans' utter dependence on God. The fact that we find in ourselves knowledge, in the attainment of which we play no role, demonstrates for Ibn al-Baqillanl that we cannot know anything, much less make sound 31 al-Tatnhld (ed. McCarthy), 257. 32 Unlike ' Abd al-Jabbar, Ibn al-Baqillanl does not have a technical definition of'aql. Depending on the context, his use of 'aql in al-Tamhid can be translated as intellect, reason, or intuition.</page><page sequence="17">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 87 ethical assessments, without the direct involvement of God. Hence, while ' Abd al-Jabbar's epistemology results in an understanding of humans as beings existentially obligated to God (mukallaf), Ibn al-Baqillanl's epistemology results in the understanding of humans as existentially dependent subjects of a divine master. Ibn al-Baqillani's rejection of deontological conceptions of justice Given 'Abd al-Jabbar's deontological conception of justice, he focuses on the nature of acts rather than their consequences.33 He argues that knowledge of the ethical attributes of acts is both intuitively and ontologically determined. We intuitively know that an act that unduly harms another is unjust, and we can be certain of our intuition because ontologically the ma'na (or 'entitative ground') of our knowledge of the act necessitates a conviction (i tiqad) in us that is experienced as 'tranquillity of the self' (sukun al-nafs). By linking ontology and intuition, 'Abd al-Jabbar's ethics allows for the circumstances of acts to play a role in making ethical assessments. For example, although the act of hitting someone for no reason is ontologically the same whether it is issued from a person who is unaware (sahin) or asleep or a person who is fully awake and aware, we intuitively know that these acts cannot be ethically assessed in the same way.34 Ibn al-Baqillanl rejects 'Abd al-Jabbar's deontological ethics by deny ing that ethical knowledge of acts is intuitive. He states (ibid, 342) that justice and injustice cannot be known 'through 'aql alone because [if they could] it would be necessary for all compos mentis individuals to share in knowledge of them.' In other words, since it is empirically demonstrable that people disagree about what is just, it cannot be said that humans have intuitive knowledge of what is good and just. Once Ibn al-Baqillanl has denied intuition any role in the making of ethical judgments, he cites examples in which the varying circumstances 33 For a comparison of 'Abd al-Jabbar's ethics with modern proponents of deontological ethics, see Abdalla Mohammad, 'The Notion of Good and Evil in the Ethics of 'Abd al-Jabbar: A Philosophical Study with a Translation of "The Determination of Justice and Injustice" (al-Ta dil wa-l-tajwir) sections 1-12', unpublished PhD dissertation, Temple University, 1983. 34 The ethical status of the acts of a person who is unaware or sleeping poses a significant problem to 'Abd al-Jabbar's deontological ethics. He was fully aware of this problem. For a discussion of how he dealt with this issue, see Kambiz GhaneaBassiri, 'A Window on Islam in Buyid Society: Justice and Its Epistemological Foundation in the Religious Thought of 'Abd al-Jabbar, Ibn al-Baqillanl, and Miskawayh', unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 2003, 70-6.</page><page sequence="18">88 KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI of acts demand different ethical assessments, thus demonstrating that acts cannot be intrinsically good or bad: Do you not see that a movement (haraka) which is a movement by itself has always to be a movement wherever it is found? This necessitates that dogs, lions, and other animals that do not reason (la ydqil) would have to be unjust, perpetrators of badness (qubh), and deserving of blame and censure. They would have to be sinners and indecent beings for their infliction of pain upon others according to this point of view. General agreement (ittifaq) on the absurdity of this is proof of the invalidity of what you say. (ibid, 342) It may seem ironic that the point Ibn al-Baqillanl wants to make in this passage depends on his audience's intuition that animals cannot be held morally responsible for their actions. However, as the last sentence of the quote shows, for Ibn al-Baqillanl, the common sense that necessitates our not holding animals morally responsible for their actions is defined not by intuition but by social convention or a general agreement.35 By defining common sense as a kind of consensual rather than intuitive knowledge, Ibn al-Baqillanl recognizes the possibility of common-sense ethical assessments but categorically denies humans an inherent means of determining what is just, independent of divine revelation. Ibn al-Baqillant's affirmation of divine subjectivism In place of intuitive and deontological ethics, Ibn al-Baqillanl affirms divine subjectivism, and does so dramatically. If someone says, 'Is it possible for God to inflict pain (yulim) on children without any compensation ('iivad), to command the killing and the infliction of pain on animals for no beneficial reason, to make some animals subordinate to others, to impose continual punishment for discontinuous crimes (al-ajram al-munqati a), to make obligatory for His servants what they cannot bear, to create in them that for which they shall be punished, and other such things?', it is said to him, 'Certainly! That is just when it is one of His actions (ajal! dhalika 'adlun min fili-h). It is permissible and commendable according to His wisdom (hikmati-h).' If he says, 'How could that be permissible and good from Him and all of it bad when issued from us?', it is said to him, 'That is bad and considered unjust when issued from us only because the Lord of living and non-living entities (mdlik al-ayan wa-l-ashya) forbade us from doing it. If He had not deemed 35 The issue of consensus is discussed by Ibn al-Baqillani in terms of tawatur, ittifaq, and ijma , and it plays a significant role in his theology. For further discussion of this issue, see GhaneaBassiri, 'Window on Islam', 120-6.</page><page sequence="19">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 89 it bad and forbidden it, it would not have been bad when it occurs from us.' (ibid, 341) Again, it may seem ironic that while Ibn al-Baqillanl categorically rejects the notion that ethical assessments could be intuitive, he presumes that his audience would intuitively regard these examples as unjust. Otherwise, the dramatic effect of his rhetoric would be lost on the reader. What is at issue for Ibn al-Baqillanl is not whether or not these acts are actually just but that individual intuitions and internal experiences should not limit God or God's revelation. Human intuition and internal feelings cannot be determinants of the justness of divine acts or revelations. Though Ibn al-Baqillanl strongly affirms divine subjectivism, his rhetorical reliance on human intuition in the above passage suggests that intuition and internal experiences are not absent from his conception of justice. He simply interprets human intuition differently from 'Abd al-Jabbar, on the basis of a different understanding of God's relation to humans. While 'Abd al-Jabbar reasons from his intuitions and perceptions that God has created intuition (aql) and perception (idrak), along with accidental thoughts (khatir), in order to guide humans toward religious obligation (taklif), Ibn al-Baqillanl interprets the divine creation of intuition and perception in humans as evidence for humanity's dependence on God. As such, he understands God's relation to man in terms of a Ruler's relation to His subject rather than a Creator's relation to a mukallaf ('divinely obligated person'). The Creator, Mighty and Exalted is He, is the Overwhelming King (al-malik al-qahir); everything belongs to Him and is in His grasp. No one commands, permits, or forbids Him. Therefore, it is not necessary for all [the acts] that we mentioned as being bad if issued from us to be analogously bad if issued from Him. (ibid, 343) God's actions, as the Lord of everything, are different from human actions because no one rules over God in the same way that God rules over humans. It follows from this that as the Overwhelming King of all things only God can determine what is good and bad, just and unjust. Ibn al-Baqillanl's definition of necessary knowledge For Ibn al-Baqillanl, God's sovereignty over humans is demonstrated through his understanding of 'ilm daruri or 'necessary knowledge'. For him, just as for 'Abd al-Jabbar, the way in which humans intuit or necessarily know something defines their relationship to God. Consequently, his definition of necessary knowledge, though similar</page><page sequence="20">9° KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI to Abd al-Jabbar's, still demonstrates his distinct understanding of humans' dependence on God. [Necessary knowledge] is knowledge that is necessarily necessitated (yulzamu luzitman) in the self (nafs) of the created so that he cannot avoid it nor disassociate from it nor would it be possible to doubt or to have misgivings about what is associated with it. The reality of such a linguistic description (wasf) is that which is existentially forced upon the knower (mimmd ukriha I- alimu bi-hi 'aid wujiidi-b). [Necessary knowledge is forced knowledge] because 'necessity' (idtirar) linguistically signifies 'inducing' (hatnl), 'forcing' (ikrah), or 'compul sion' (ilja). All of these words have the same meaning. There is no difference, in this regard, between one saying, 'the Sultan necessitated him (idtarra-h) to surrender what he had and to sell his property' and one saying 'he forced him (.akraha-h) to do that' or 'induced him' (hamala-h) or 'compelled him' (alja'a-h). Based on what we have explained, it necessarily follows that what we said is a signification that describes knowledge as a necessity. Knowledge and all else that is in the genus of necessity has been described in such a way as to signify that the knower is in need of it (muhtdj ilay-h) because necessity (darura) linguistically means 'needing' (haja)[...] Every one in need of knowledge, or any other type of thing, is compelled toward (mudtarr ild) what he needs, (ibid, 8) It is clear from this passage that although Ibn al-Baqillanl rejects intuitive knowledge of what is good/just and bad/unjust, he does not reject necessary or intuitive knowledge altogether; he relies on it to demon strate humans' continued need for God. For Ibn al-Baqillanl, the fact that God creates intuitions in humans does not validate human intuitions of what is just; on the contrary, it shows that we are in need of God for all of our knowledge. Ibn al-Baqillanl's conception of justice, just as 'Abd al-Jabbar's, is personalistic in that it is founded on his understanding of personal intuition. In order to argue that intuition is not enough and that we need God to elucidate what is just, Ibn al-Baqillanl first sets out to prove that God has spoken his commands to humanity through the medium of revelation. Secondly, he seeks to prove that humans have an accurate record of God's commands on which they can rely, even when God is not speaking to them directly. Finally, he tries to show that God's revealed speech is intelligible to humans in all places at all times. His proof for all of these points is found in his understanding of necessary knowledge or intuition. Before moving on to discuss Ibn al-Baqillanl's understanding of necessary knowledge, it may be worth pointing out that 'Abd al-Jabbar, being a Muslim theologian, did not disagree with Ibn al-Baqillanl about the enduring significance of divine revelations, nor did he dispute the validity of the Quran as an accurate source of divine commands.</page><page sequence="21">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 91 My concern here is not with the ways in which the two theologians established the validity of the Quran as a source of divinely revealed commands. Rather, my aim is to show how necessary knowledge serves as a theological argument for Ibn al-Baqillani's assertions that justice is whatever God commands. Since necessary knowledge is necessarily known, it cannot be explained, so Ibn al-Baqillanl, like 'Abd al-Jabbar, provides a list of what he believes constitutes necessary knowledge. He divides necessary knowledge into six parts. The first five are each associated with what we perceive (idrak) through our five senses respectively (ibid, 9). The sixth is a rather vast category that encompasses what he calls knowledge invented (mukhtara ) in the self a priori (ibtida an), in other words, knowledge that is known prior to sense experience. This category of necessary knowledge includes knowledge of: one's existence, one's state of health, pain and pleasure, will (irada) and impotence (ajz), shyness and courage, and reverence (birr) and recalcitrance (cuquq). Knowledge of axioms of logic is also classified as part of intuition or necessary knowledge. Hence, we intuitively know that two contradictory state ments cannot both be true. While most would agree that the above examples are forms of intuitive knowledge, the rest of what he considers to be known intuitively serves to establish the validity of divine revelation, on which he relies as our source of knowledge for what is just. Within [this category of necessary knowledge] is also the knowledge of the fact that the intent of a speaker (mutakallim), when he speaks, is directed toward what he intends and only toward whom he intends it and that he intends for [the recipient of his speech] to acquire (iktisab) knowledge of the existence of his abilities (maqdiirdt) in terms of speech and other related matters [...] Within [this category] is also the knowledge that a continuously recurrent and widely distributed report (tawdtur) of something is news of its existence. Examples of these are: the knowledge that occurs from news brought forth by reporters from China, Khurasan, Fars, Kirman, and about the appearance of Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, God bless him and all other prophets; and the news of events, civil strife (fitan), kings, governments, and other similar matters, the news about which occurs by way of a group that fulfils its responsibility of transmitting [information]. When they report it [i.e., the news] knowledge is necessitated. It is also sound (yasihh) that God invent knowledge of the existence of something reported from Him without the report being heard from Him temporally. Given this fact, it is sound that there be violations of customs ('adat), the appearance of miracles (mujizat), and interruptions in the usual order of affairs, (ibid, 10-11) The last of these six types of necessary knowledge—divine knowledge that is created in an individual by God but is not heard by others—allows</page><page sequence="22">KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI for revelation to occur as a divinely necessitated personal experience. Despite its extraordinariness, Ibn al-Baqillanl considers this to be a form of 'necessary knowledge', the experience of which demonstrates that miracles or 'interruptions in the usual order of affairs' are possible. It would be easy to fault the logic of what Ibn al-Baqillanl claims here, but for our purposes the logical validity of his claim is beside the point. What is of interest to the topic at hand is his method of argumentation. Ibn al-Baqillanl seeks to validate revelation by pointing to externally unverifiable, internal experiences. Ibn al-Baqillanl does not give us a specific example of a divinely invented report in a person that is unheard by others. However, given that he categorizes this form of knowledge as 'necessary knowledge', it must mean that he is referring to an externally unverifiable, internal experience that is common to all humans. Given that God creates all knowledge, it seems that for Ibn al-Baqillanl, an externally unverifiable, internal experience, such as a 'gut feeling' or a premonition, demonstrates that God can communicate with individual humans without anyone else knowing. Revelation then, as one form of such experiences, though truly extraordinary, is validated by a common place notion for Ibn al-Baqillanl: human intuitions and internal experi ences are in actuality divine creations that directly connect God to humans. What distinguishes the divine creation of unverifiable internal experiences in us from the revelation that established the prophecies of [the Prophet], Ibn al-Baqillanl explains, is the fact that [the Prophet's] experiences were accompanied by 'the splendid verses [of the Quran], undeniable miracles, and [other] clear proofs that are out of the ordinary, uncustomary, and outside of the natural order (tarkib al-tabiaY (ibid, 132). For Ibn al-Baqillanl there is no question as to whether or not God can reveal knowledge to someone without the awareness of others; his concern is with the trustworthiness of the person who claims to have received divinely revealed knowledge. The agreement of the speakers of our language that all fire is hot and burns and that all humans have such and such a composition is deduced through everyone, among trustworthy people (sadiqiin), who reported to us that they saw a fire or a human. As speakers of our language, they intended to make us understand that they saw what is similar to what we call, among ourselves, fire or a human and nothing else[...] Similarly, a miracle is inferred from the trustworthiness of him before whom it appeared because its validity is based on his testimony of its appearance, (ibid, 12-13) According to Ibn al-Baqillanl, the foundation of all human knowledge—whether of miracles or of such empirically verifiable matters as the natural properties of fire—is ultimately personal.</page><page sequence="23">EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CONCEPTIONS 93 . This personal knowledge is generalized, not by ontology or universal human intuition as * Abd al-Jabbar would have it, but by general agree ment among people, based upon trustworthy reports of its recurrence. Personal knowledge is thus generalized by the second of Ibn al-Baqillanl' s three types of intuitive knowledge—knowledge of the validity of 'recurring and widely distributed reports (tawatur)'. This is a concept used by scholars of badltb to distinguish the most sound Prophetic traditions from less sound or weak ones. A badltb is consi dered sound when it is repeated by trustworthy persons from a variety of places and found recurring during each generation from the Prophet's lifetime onward. What Ibn al-Baqillanl asserts here is that the fact that one knows, for example, that Greenland exists, based on 'recurring and widely distributed reports', even though one has never seen Greenland, is based on the fact that we intuitively and necessarily recognize the validity of consensual knowledge concerning it. By identifying the validity of what is known through tawatur as a form of necessary knowledge, he articulates a way in which personal knowledge can be universalized without any form of empirical investigation. In this way he establishes the validity of the revelation to the Prophet and its record as preserved in the Qur'an.36 As for knowledge of the appearance of the Prophet (God's blessing be upon him) in Makka and Madina and of His calling him to Himself, this knowledge occurs necessarily (min jihat al-idtirar) because Muslims, Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Sabeans, Dualists, Atheists, and every sectarian deviant agrees that the Quran that is recited in our mibrabs and inscribed in our books arose from the capacity of the Prophet (God bless him and grant him peace). In regard to its advent, there is no disagreement among them, (ibid, 133) In other words, the Qur'an is necessarily known, by way of tawatur, to be an accurate record of divine revelation from which humans can discern God's commands and prohibitions in order to determine what is just and unjust. Once Ibn al-Baqillanl has shown that divine commands can be revealed and that their soundness can be assessed through 'recurring and widely distributed reports', he has also to show that humans in all places and at all times can understand the intention and meaning of divine revelation. Ibn al-Baqillani does this by asserting that we intuitively know that what a speaker intends is understood by the person for whom 36 This argument also validates baditb as a valid corpus of divinely inspired knowledge, even though Ibn al-Baqillanl does not specifically mention hadtth in this context.</page><page sequence="24">94 KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI the speech is intended. In other words, humans intuitively know that what one intends can be communicated through speech. He also asserts that by speaking, a speaker intends for the recipient of the speech to acquire knowledge of his ability to speak. Anyone familiar with the early history of Islam will immediately recognize in this an argument against Mu'tazill attempts to disassociate any anthropomorphic ideas from God by denying that the Quran was conveyed by God to the Prophet. This denial led to the Mutazili claim that the Quran is God's created speech.37 Ibn al-Baqillanl, like Ash aris in general, would not have understood himself as an anthropomorphist. What was at stake for him was the eternal nature of revelation. As uncreated divine speech, the commands and prohibitions of the Quran remain valid for all times and can always be used to determine what is good and bad, just and unjust. If the speech of God, Exalted is He, was created—and it is agreed that it is not of the genus of corporeal bodies (ajsam)—then it would have to be an accident farad). If it were an accident, it would necessarily become extinct at some point because of its state of contingency (min hali huduthi-h). It would also necessarily mean that the Creator, Exalted is He, would not, in our times, command or forbid anything.... However, according to the consensus of the Muslim community (ijma al-umma), God, Blessed and Exalted is He, commands His creation at the present time to obey Him and forbids them from disobeying Him. That He speaks (anna-hu mutakallim bi-) His commands and prohibitions to his creation indicates that it is impossible for Him to speak with a created and accidental speech. The reason for this is that it is impossible for accidents to subsist [indefinitely], (ibid, 238-9) When Ibn al-Baqillanl states that we intuit the intent of a speech as it was intended by its speaker and that upon hearing speech we intuit that its speaker has the ability to speak, he means to affirm the enduring validity of divinely revealed commands. By listing such knowledge as a form of necessary knowledge, he universalizes the validity of divine revelation for all of creation at all times. To summarize, Ibn al-Baqillanl's conception of justice as whatever God commands is founded on epistemological inquiries into human intuitions and internal experiences that are intended to demonstrate the 37 For a historical background to this controversy, see Wilfred Madelung, The Origins of the Controversy Concerning the Creation of the Koran' in J.

Rejecting intuitive and deontological conceptions of justice, Ibn al-Baqillanl argues that revelation is the only source for determining what is just. Through his inquiry into how humans know, he seeks to demonstrate humans' utter dependence on God for knowledge of all ethical precepts. He interprets necessary knowledge as a form of knowledge that is 'impelled' or 'forced upon' humans by their Creator and Lord. He thus understands humans' standing vis-a-vis God in terms of a ruler-subject relationship and asserts that justice is whatever the Ruler commands for His subjects. CONCLUSION For 'Abd al-Jabbar and Ibn al-Baqillanl, who were the main representa tives of the Basran Mu'tazili and Ash'ari schools of kalam at the turn of the fifth/eleventh century, justice was not defined as an abstract ideal subject to independent theoretical inquiry; rather it was a branch of epistemology. The significance of epistemology for their conceptions of justice is clearly illustrated by the fact that they opposed one another's conception of justice by opposing one another's definition of intuition and necessary knowledge. For each of them, accepting the validity of the other's epistemology necessarily resulted in accepting his conception of justice. For both 'Abd al-Jabbar and Ibn al-Baqillanl the way in which humans interpret the intuitions and internal experiences that God created in them define the way in which they understand their relation ship to God. The fact that theological disputes in their times were indexed by different interpretations of intuition or necessary knowledge and internal experiences suggests that how individuals interpret their relationship to God through intuitions and internal experiences was not considered to be only a personal matter but also one of communal significance. Both theologians viewed those who disagreed with their under standings of knowledge and justice as sources of moral corruption in society; insofar as they misunderstood how one knows what is just, neither mutakallim could trust his opponents to act justly in society. It follows from this that the primary means of religiously acting in society to effect justice, as 'Abd al-Jabbar indicates in the above-cited passage, was to affect the way individuals reflect upon themselves and the world, or more specifically, to affect the way in which they conceive their intuitions, internal experiences, and sense perceptions in relation</page><page sequence="26">96 KAMBIZ GHANEABASSIRI to God, the world, and other humans. The fact that Abd al-Jabbar's and Ibn al-Baqillanl's conceptions of justice are founded on analyses of individual epistemologies, intuitions, and internal experiences has impor tant implications for understanding the relationship between Islamic thought and its sociopolitical context. The prevailing tendency is to read Muslim conceptions of justice in terms of theories of government and the politics of the state. However, in the case at hand, two influential Muslim thinkers' conceptions of justice are founded upon distinct understandings of individual epistemologies and internal experiences. If my reading is accurate, then a certain theoretical modification may be in order. The works of these two mutakallims support the centrality of the individual as the locus of knowledge through which humans are related to God, to one another, and to the world. It may be helpful to keep this classical kalam theory in mind when we engage in larger discussions of how justice has been conceived in Islamic history.
