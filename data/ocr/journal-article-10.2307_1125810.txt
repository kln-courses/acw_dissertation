RUSSELL2 INTRODUCTION It is of utmost interest to determine whether the thought tendencies which have been investigated by Piaget are characteristic of children universally, or whether these tendencies are exhibited only in certain milieu, we are particularly concerned with the ideas which Plaget dis- cussed in "The Child's Conception of the World" (3), namely, animism, real- ism and artificialism. Up to the present time the questions which Piaget reported in this important publication have been asked only of European and American white children. Mead's (2) report concerning the apparent lack of animism in Manus children of the Admiralty Islands does not con- stitute an exception to the above statement, since Mead did not employ Piaget's methods. It remains to be shown that Mead's techniques are ade- quate to reveal animistic tendencies in children. For this reason, we cannot agree with Mead that her results are at variance with those of the Genevan investigator. In the summers of 1937, 1938 and 1940 we employed certain of Piaget's methods with some children who were attending the government day school in the farming village of Nutria on the Zuni Indian Reservation. The in- vestigations of the first two summers were conducted by the senior author; those of the summer of 1940 were carried out by the junior author. The questioning was conducted in English, which is, of course, the language used in the school. Since the native language is spoken in the children's homes, and English is learned chiefly at school, no child was questioned unless he had been in attendance for at least two years and unless he showed an ability to name the objects about which our questions were asked. In all, 24 children were examined, 15 boys and 9 girls, but not every one was examined with reference to each topic. On the other hand, some children were examined on the same topic in each of two or even all three summers. The number of children examined in reference to each topic will be reported in connection with the report of results. The subjects ranged in age from 8 to 16 years. Prior to the examinations conducted by each investigator, he spent one or more days at the school as a visitor, playing with the children, speaking with them and gaining their confidence. Each investigator ex- plained that he taught white boys and girls, that he was anxious to become acquainted with Zuni children, and that he wanted to ask each of them some questions. The subjects were friendly, and rapport was good through- out. Each subject was examined individually in a room separated from the classroom. 1This research has been made possible by grants-tn-ald to the senior author on the part of the Social Science Research Council, whose support is gratefully acknowledged. Appreciation is also expressed to Mrs. Rol Poe and Nrs. 'arp . Sell, teachers at the Nutria Day School, for their wtlling cooperation. 2University of Virgtnta and University of Nebraska. 181 CHILD DEVELOPMENT, Vol. 11, No. 3 (September, 1940)</page><page sequence="2">DENNIS AND RUSSELL: PIAGET'S QUESTIONS ANIMISM The topic of animism was the one on which the most time was spent. Questions concerning which items in a series of objects were living and which were dead were asked in each of the three visits to the school. In 1938 and in 1940, a procedure for the study of animism which we have de- scribed elsewhere (6) was employed. This method asks essentially the same questions as did Piaget, but it makes use of a standardized list of objects, selected because of their universality. In 1937, this procedure had not yet been adopted, but the questions asked were the same, and many of the objects used were the same, as those later employed. In all 24 children between 8 and 16 years of age were examined with reference to animism. Some were examined during each of two summers, a few in all three summers. The total number of examinations was 37. All of the answers which were obtained from the Zuni subjects were of the same types as those described by Piaget and which also were found in our studies of white American children. Typically, in Stage 1 the knife was living because it could cut, the button employed in the experi- ment was dead because it was broken, etc. In Stage 2, the motionless objects were said to be dead, but a watch, clouds, moon and the wind were alive because they moved. A pencil was living when the experimenter rolled it on the table but not when it lay still. Illustrations of answers at the higher stages are few for Zuni sub- jects because only 4 of the 37 examinations were scored as being above Stage 1. Twenty-eight of the 37 were in Stage 1, while 5 subjects showed that they had no concept of living things. While the number of subjects at any age level is too small to justify serious comparison with the white groups which we have studied (4), the evidence tends to show that the Indian children are retarded. Of the 33 examinations conducted with children under 13 years of age, 31 sets of answers revealed either "no concept" or Stage 1. In our experience with white groups of normal intelligence and of ages comparable to the Zuni children we have found no such preponderance of no concept and Stage 1 answers. However, the number of Zuni examinations is too few to permit a statement concerning the reliability of the difference. With 13 subjects it was possible to compare records obtained in two different summers. Some of these records were separated by one year and others by two years. Eight of the 13 subjects showed no change, 3 sub- jects advanced one stage in the later test and 2 retrogressed one stage. There is no indication that these subjects, on the whole, were showing progressive changes in their concepts. IDEAS OF CONSCIOUSNESS In the summer of 1940, 14 subjects were questioned concerning the ability of each object in our standardized list to "feel" when it was touched. The question concerning the first eight objects was, "Does the feel when I touch it?", the experimenter touching the object as he asked the question. The question was changed appropriately for objects not immediately present (5). Eight of the 14 subjects were in the no concept stage; that is, they answered at random or answered "yes" or "no" 182</page><page sequence="3">DENNIS AND RUSSELL: PIAGET'S QUESTIONS uniformly in regard to all objects without respect to their condition or characteristics. Three subjects gave Stage 1 answers; that is, all ob- jects which were useful and in good condition were said to be able to feel. Two subjects limited such consciousness to man, or to man and ani- mals, and hence were classified as in the adult stage. No Stage 2 and Stage 3 answers were obtained. On the basis of the present evidence we cannot determine whether this fact was due to the small number of examina- tions or whether these stages do not occur in Zuni children. We, suspect that the former interpretation is the correct one. THE ORGAN OF THOUGHT The questions concerning the remaining topics were asked only in the summer of 1937. They are taken from the examples of Piaget, and will be familiar to those who are acquainted with "The Child's Conception of the World." The chief difference between our method and that of Piaget lies in the fact that we attempted to ask the same questions of all subjects, and tried to use the same objects of reference in all cases, whereas Piaget varied his questions and interrogated one child about objects which were not referred to in the case of other subjects. One group of queries asked in 1937 had to do with the organs by which various functions are performed. The initial questions were intended merely to establish rapport. They were, "What do you hear with?" "What do you see with?" "What do you run with?" These are answered by white children in a stereotyped manner and were answered in the same way by the Zuni subjects. Then each subject was asked the final question, "What do you think with?" to which Piaget has found that young children reply "with the mouth." Older subjects, of course, give the learned answer that it is'done with the heart or the head. Ten Zuni subjects, ranging in age from 8 to 13 years, were examined. Three gave no answer or else said they did not know. Two, however, one of eight and one of nine years of age, said thinking was done with the mouth. Three gave the learned answer that it is done with the heart or the head. One answered "the eyes" and one answered "arm." The latter was probably an answer by analogy to the answers of the preceding ques- tions; the other reply may also have been this, or it may have had refer- ence to visual imagery in thinking. It is of interest that the answer given by Piaget's subjects also was given by Zuni subjects. However, most of the Zuni children were too old to lead one to expect them to give the childish conception. DREAM REALISM Each of 9 subjects was asked if he sometimes dreamed when he was asleep. After an affirmative answer was received, he was asked further, "Do you see your dreams or do you hear them or do you see and hear them?" Following this, Piaget's question relative to the location of dreams was put, "Where are they when you see them?" (or "when you hear them" accord- ing to the previous answer of the subject). To this question 4 replied that they did not know; these subjects ranged in age from 8 to 13 years. Four, varying in age from 8 to 12 183</page><page sequence="4">DENNIS AND RUSSEL: PIAGET'S QUESTIONS years, placed the dreams externally as did many of Piaget's subjects; only one subject gave the learned answer "in the head." After this question, we followed Piaget's recommendation and suggested that dreams were in the head, excluding of course in this procedure the child who had already given this answer. Only one of the remaining eight accepted this suggestion; all the rest denied that our idea was correct. This, too, is in accord with Piaget's experience (3). Then came the last inquiry concerning the objectivity of dreams: "If someone else were near you when you had a dream could he see or hear your dream?" Six of the nine subjects answered "Yes." This could not have been the result of a general tendency to give affirmative answers, since the immediately preceding question elicited predominantly negative re- plies. ARTIFICIALISM The last set of questions had to do with notions concerning the origin of a number of objects chosen so that they would be familiar to our sub- jects. In this instance we did not employ a rigidly standardized proced- ure but asked our questions variously in the following forms:, "Where do we get _ ?" "Where does come from?" "How do we come to have ?" An attempt was made throughout to make these questions real to the subjects and to interest them in solving these problems. Nine sub- jects were employed; these were the same nine children who have been re- ferred to in the immediately preceding sections, and varied in age from 8 to 13 years as shown in Table 1.

In this table "n. a." in- dicates "not answered" and "d. k." denotes that the child said he did not know. Table 1 reveals a number of practical and common sense answers. All children know that matches are made and come from a store. However, cof- fee is likewise a store product. Trees, and corn and cactus, on the other hand, are known to grow from the ground. Answers to a supplemen- tary question as to whether these objects were planted by people (these answers are not shown in the table) revealed that all children knew that corn must be planted, that trees were sometimes planted, but that cactus is never planted. There were no artificialistic answers regarding the origin of cactus, although one might have expected such. In regard to clouds and hills, some artificialistic and some natural- istic theories were evolved, and each answer was apparently an independent solution. Three Zuni children believed that clouds are due to smoke aris- ing from stoves, a theory noted by Piaget. The others who answered the question held that the clouds came from the air, from the sky, etc. Whether clouds were indirectly traceable to smoke in these instances was not determined. Four origins for hills were recorded. Two subjects held that hills were made of dust and sand piled up by the wind, a process often observa- ble in the Southwest. One girl claimed that hills grow from the ground. One girl said someone piled up the earth to make the hills. In regard to the origin of rain, the usual answer was that it came from the clouds. Since the Zuni belief is that men can induce rain by the proper use of dances and other ceremonies, four of the initial an- swers were followed by a second question, "Can people make it rain?" Four of five Zuni children held that people cannot make it rain. Only one gave the adult reply, namely, that prayer sticks are effective agents in bringing rain. This ignorance on the part of the children checks with the statement of Zuni adults that ceremonies are seldom explained to the children until they are beyond twelve years of age. The origins of eggs, shirts, pencils, dams, chicks and lambs were in general correctly known. On the whole very few artificialistic answers were given. Brooks, however, were thought by three subjects to be man- made. Some of the other answers, while superficially naturalistic, might have proved to be the result of an artificialistic interpretation had the question been followed up. However, in a few instances replies of a naturalistic tenor were pursued further with results consistently of a non-artificialistic nature. For example, Neil, who said the sun was made "of yellow," when asked suggestively if some person made it, said no. Again our data are only indicative of a problem; we cannot attempt quantitative comparisons of the artificialism of Zuni and white children because not sufficient data relative to either are at hand. However, tentatively it would appear that the Zuni subjects give fewer artificial- istic origins than do Piaget's subjects. If this proves to be the case it may well find its explanation in the fact that the Zuni child is more closely associated with phenomena of generation and growth and much less in contact with articles of human manufacture. The meager material cul- ture of primitive peoples may lead to a lesser degree of artificialism in the primitive child. 185</page><page sequence="6">DENNIS AND RUSSEL: PIAGET'S QUESTIONS DISCUSSION The results here reported should be considered as the outcome of an exploratory investigation. They are not sufficiently numerous to enable one to make more than the roughest comparisons with data from white sub- jects. On the quantitative side, however, we cannot refrain from remark- ing that Piaget's data, no less than these, are insufficient for compara- tive purposes. One question which demands serious attention is that of the language factor. The Zuni subjects are bilingual. English is merely an auxiliary language. Since the child first learns Zuni and continually uses it ex- cept when he is in school, it is altogether likely that he thinks in Zuni and does a considerable amount of translation in order to understand and to answer questions such as those here reported. In the course of this translation, much distortion of meaning may take place. It would be most valuable could each investigation of child thought be conducted in the native language by someone thoroughly familiar with that language. This was out of the question in the present instance. However, in connection with the questions concerning animism, we attempted to familiarize ourselves with the Zuni concepts to which the child is ex- posed and to learn the Zuni words into which the child may have translated our question. In regard to the animistic use of language, the Zuni prac- tice would seem to approximate our own. In referring to natural objects many anthropomorphic terms are used, terms which are comparable to our speaking of an angry cloud, a treacherous river, a fierce wind, etc. But in respect to the Zuni term which designates life or animation, ho'i, each of four native informants insisted that it is used just like our English term "living"; i.e., it is used only in reference to persons, ani- mals and plants. The Zuni child's extension of the term to cover all use- ful and undamaged objects is wrong from the point of view of the Zuni adult, and is quite comparable to the tendencies of the white American and European child. Our informants flatly denied Bunzel's statement (1) that to the Zuni all objects are animated. Bunzel may, however, have been referring primarily to the Zuni's metaphorical use of anthropomorphic terms, although she mentions specifically the word ho'i about which we questioned our informants. In addition to persons, animals and plants, the Zuni speak of super- natural beings as living; in that respect, also, their usage parallels ours. SUMMARY A considerable number of the questions employed by Piaget and reported in "The Child's Conception of the World" were put to some or all of 24 Zuni school children who ranged in age from 8 to 16 years. In regard to each topic, the answers obtained from the Zuni children comprised all or nearly all of the types described by Piaget; they are also like those recorded by ourselves in previous studies. No new types of answers were obtained. In other words, the conceptions of the Zuni child seem not to differ from those of Piaget's French-speaking and of our American subjects. Whether there is a difference in the age-incidence of various answers 186</page><page sequence="7">DENNIS AND RUSSELL: PIAGET'S QUESTIONS as between Zuni and European or American children cannot be said at the present time because the data are not sufficiently numerous. The data available suggest that Zuni clhildren on the whole may persist longer in the first stage of animism than do white American children, but that the Zuni subjects develop fewer artificialistic notions or else forsake them at an earlier age. If these differences prove to be real, they may be the result of specific environmental factors rather than representing a general difference between primitive and civilized children.
