The foreign jade was placed on top of one of the grinding stones, together with other jades in local styles. Stone (1977) sug gests, based on the ceramics présent, that the burial might date to the Late Middle B Period (A.D. 850-1502). Jade objects recovered from funerary contexts in Costa Rica date to around 500 B.C.-A.D. 900 (Guerrero 1986,1993,1998). By A.D. 900 the Costa Rican jade lapidary tradition was in decline. Consequently, it is more likely that the déposition of the jades took place closer to the beginning of the Late Middle B phase, ca. A.D. 850. Interestingly, a significant number of Mesoamerican artifacts have been recovered in Costa Rica (Stone 1964), all of them exotic items or preciosities (e.g., jade pendants, pyrite-incrusted mirrorback slate disks, fine ceramic and marble vases). Most of these imports are Mayan (Baiser 1980; Fields and Reents-Budet 1992; Stone and Baiser 1965), but some are Middle Preclassic Olmec and Late Preclassic Epi Olmec (Baiser 1958; Pohorilenko 1981; Snarskis 1979). Some authors have argued that these Mesoamerican imports do not point to a systematized interaction between Meso american and Costa Rican peoples. However, the fact that the only known source of jadeite in Middle America lies within the Mayan région (Bishop and Lange 1993), and the absence of a source of jadeite in Costa Rica (Lange and Bishop 1988), suggest that the Costa Ricans may have attempted to formal ize their relationship with Mesoamerican providers in order to secure a supply of raw materials for their jade lapidary industry. pjg j a) Drawing of Epi-Olmec jade pendant with incised figure of Evidence for such a formalized relationship may befound a noble (suspension holes shown in black).

These two artifacts constitute the most important sources of data used by Justeson and Kaufman (1992, 1993, 1997) in their decipherment of Epi Olmec writing, which has revealed the identity of the Epi Olmec as speakers of pre-proto-Zoquean (Mixe-Zoquean).

I think it likely that the piece arrived in Costa Rica during the Classic period as a resuit of indirect exchange with intermediarles in the Lowland Mayan or Southeastern Periphery région, rather than as a resuit of direct exchange with Epi-Olmec traders in Veracruz and Tabasco. This is because the Cerro de las Mesas cache where a few Costa Rican artifacts were found also contained Mayan jades (Drucker 1955; Reents-Budet and Fields 1991). This supports the possibility that the Mayans were the intermedi aries. Finally, while Mesoamerican artifacts are rare in Costa Rica, when considered in terms of the total volume of ar chaeological findings, a more or less formalized trade be tween the Costa Ricans and Mesoamericans must have ex isted if the raw jadeite used by the Costa Rican jade lapidary tradition originated in the Motagua Valley. In other words, finished foreign imports cannot be regarded as the main evidence of exchange, especially concerning the volume and formalization of the exchange. If most of the raw jadeite used by the Costa Rican tradition came from Mesoamerica, the rare Mesoamerican finished products become simply a small part of the total amount of imported materials from Mesoamerica.

RESUMEN : En el presente ensayo la redefinición estilística de un pendiente de jade publicado por Doris Stone (1977) esta propuesto. Stone describió el objeto como un „bote olmeca"; sin embargo, en base a una comparación estilística e iconográfica entre textos epi-olmecas y la figura incisa en el pendiente en cuestión, se puede demostrar que éste es de estilo epi-olmeca en vez de olmeca. Se sugiere en forma preliminar que el pendiente fue inciso durante el período Preclásico Tardío en Veracruz. También se propone, dado que el hallazgo del pendiente se realizó en la Vertiente Atlántica de Costa Rica, que esta redefinición estilística otorga apoyo a la hipótesis de Anatoli Pohorilenko (1981) de que la mayoría de los supuestos jades olmecas que han sido encontrados en Costa Rica son en realidad posteriores al fenómeno olmeca, y datan del período Preclásico Tardío. También se propone que la evidencia arqueológica de Costa Rica y la región de Veracruz podría indicar que comerciantes mayas sirvieron como intermediarios entre veracruceños y costarricenses. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: In diesem Artikel wird der Stil eines von Doris Stone ( 1977) als Olmekisch beschriebenen Jadeanhängers als Epiolmekisch neu definiert. Diese Neudefinition basiert auf den ausgesprochen engen stilistischen und ikonographischen Parallelen zwischen den Hieroglyphen auf der Tuxtla-Statuette und La Mojarra Stela 1 einerseits und der in den Jadeanhänger eingravierten menschlichen Gestalt andererseits. Eine wahrscheinlich Spät-Vorklassische Datierung für die ursprüngliche Her stellung des Stücks liegt nahe. Darüber hinaus stützt das in Costa Rica entdeckte Stück die Vermutung von Anatoli Pohorilenko (1981), dass die meisten der im so genannten Olmekischen Stil gefertigten Jadestücke aus Costa Rica in Wirklichkeit aus der späten Vorklassik stammen. Desweiteren erscheint wahrscheinlich, dass man basierend auf archäologischen Daten aus Costa Rica und der Veracruz-Region vermuten kann, dass Maya Kaufleute oder Eliten als Mittler zwischen den Costaricanern und den Epiolmeken gedient haben könnten. 19 IMPRESSUM www.mexicon.de mexicon ISSN 0720-5988 Editor: Gordon Whittaker (Alte Dorfstr. 57d, Eddigehausen, 37120 Bovenden, Germany; email: editor@mexicon.de).
