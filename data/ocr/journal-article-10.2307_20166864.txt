<plain_text><page sequence="1">The building's face and the Herculean paradigm Agendas and agency in Roman Renaissance architecture CHARLES BURROUGHS A missionary blamed his African flock for walking undressed. "And what about yourself?" they pointed to his visage, "are not you, too, somewhere naked?" "Well, but that is my face." "Yet in us," retorted the natives, "everywhere it is face."1 One significant feature of postmodern architectural discourse has been the rehabilitation of the term "facade"?literally, the building's face?to conceptualize the front plane or elevation of a building. Nevertheless, this long-discredited term can no longer be used with the innocence of earlier epochs, because the rejection of facade architecture, sometimes denounced as facadism, was central to the polemics of modernism; modernists advocated, instead, an architecture generated from within, like a bubble.2 Both conceptions are rooted in the architectural culture of the Renaissance, when the term "facade" in its current usage entered the major European languages.3 On the one hand, analogies between the human body and a building or a privileged part thereof were crucial in the establishment, following Vitruvius, of the normative conception of a building as an integrated, well proportioned, organic whole. In Renaissance architectural practice, on the other hand, the organicity and commensurability required by the theorists were often challenged, if not subverted, by the separateness of the facade and its assertive role in the circulation of social information and energy. This did not cancel the body metaphor, however, but dislocated it: the fac(ad)e resisted incorporation into the "body" of a building. The internal inconsistency evident in the application of body analogies in architecture complicated the discussion. In Renaissance treatises two kinds of architectural anthropomorphism prominently occur, both derived from Vitruvius.4 The homo ad quadratum et circulum (the man in the square and circle) reconciled human proportions with the mathematical and cosmological relations that provided the axiomatic basis and legitimation of all'antica architectural design (fig. 1). The figure concerned was always represented as insistently male, a gendering evidently assumed compatible with, if not necessary for, its claim to universal validity.5 Nevertheless, the reader of Renaissance architectural texts encounters images of paradigmatic columns as metamorphic human bodies gendered male or female, I would like to express my gratitude to the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, where the first draft of this paper was written; to Irving and Marilyn Lavin for stimulating suggestions and sympathetic criticism; and to Joseph Rykwert for challenging me to address his seminar on architecture and the body at the University of Pennsylvania?this paper is based on my response. 1.

In modem usage the term "facade" is used in the reverse direction of its original metaphoric transfer: humans have or hide behind a facade when suspected of insincerity or dissimulation. This sense of "facade" can be traced to the sixteenth century, for example, to Benedetto Varchi (ca. 1550) as quoted in Vocabulario degli Accademici della Crusca (Florence, 1884), 5.1, p. 467.

Moreover, such column figures echo Vitruvian references to certain anthropomorphic supports as (re)presentations of captives (e.g., the Caryatids) in triumphal architecture, in which the captives' shameful labor resonates with the carrying function of columns. Certainly, columns in Renaissance architecture were by no means always figures of subordination; the recognition, however, of this tradition of anthropomorphism directs attention, more generally, to the inscription of power relations in architectural formations, even against the background of assertions of the transcendent basis and universal validity of the classical architectural system. This tension between particularity and universalism was especially acute in the architecture of facades. For all the current interest in the concept of the facade and its connotations, the archaeology of the Corinthian order. See John B. Onians, Bearers of Meaning: The Classical Orders in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance (Princeton, N.J., 1988), p. 191 (cf. Vitruvius, De architectura 3.5, 4.1, 4.3). Such a marked discrepancy between two kinds of gendering presumably was a factor in the early disappearance of the anthropomorphizing treatment of a building as a whole.</page><page sequence="3">Burroughs: The building's face and the Herculean paradigm 9 term has yet to be written;6 the present discussion is intended in part as a contribution to such an archaeology, followed by the investigation of a specific case of the addition of a new front to a major building, although in such a way that the facade character of the new front was transcended through a profound rethinking of the idea of organicity and the body metaphor in architecture. The developments analyzed in this paper occurred against a background of profound social and cultural shifts; however, the focus will be on an intense architectural discourse revealed in buildings but generally absent from the treatise literature, as in the remarkable case of the pronouncements of the most inventive architect and prominent architectural theorist of the early Renaissance, Leon Battista Alberti. I. On the archaeology of the notion of "facade" If any single building deserves to inaugurate a history of secular facade architecture, it is Alberti's Palazzo Rucellai in Florence. This group of disparate structures is fronted by a masonry screen or skin of stone that denies the heterogeneity behind it but celebrates most emphatically the social position and cultural horizon of the patron, a leading member of the local patriciate (fig. 3). This facade "spoke," to use the linguistic metaphor referred to it by Filarete in the decade after its construction, in the new, ornate classical idiom of Renaissance architecture.7 Alberti was of course one of the most prominent literary figures of his time, particularly and explicitly attentive to linguistic choice and expressive devices. His architectural projects, beginning with the Tempio Malatestiano of circa 1450, consistently confronted the problem of facing an existing structure?or, at least, a conceptually separate structure?in response to a patron's directives or concerns. In contrast to Brunelleschi, one might well Figure 3. Palazzo Rucellai, Florence, facade. Photo: Courtesy of Alinari/Art Resource, New York. characterize Alberti as an architect of facades.8 Yet if one turns to his famous treatise on architecture, written shortly before and concurrently with the design of the Tempio, one encounters no expression that approximates the familiar sense of the term "facade" as a separately conceived and composed element fronting a building from which it is frankly distinct. 6. For a sketch of such a project, see Rossi (1968), pp. 308-309. Subsequently, to my knowledge, no more exhaustive treatment has been attempted, although important contributions have been made by Schumacher (1987) and Werner Oechslin, "Zwischen Aussen und Innen: die Wand und ihre Schauseite, die Fassade," Archithese 22.3 (1992), special issue entitled Nur Fassade/Fa?ade, pp. 27-29 (Oechslin refers to a study in Daidalos [19821 with the promising title "Fassade?ein sp?ter Begriff"; the issue in question does not include such an article). No other article in Nur Fassade discusses the historical dimension of the topic, but see the theoretical study of Andr? V. Heiz, "Vorwand einer Anatomie: Die Fassade," ibid., pp. 20-26. 7. John Spencer, ed., Filarete's Treatise on Architecture, 2 vols. (New Haven and London, 1965), 1:120. 8. For Alberti as a pioneer of facade architecture see, for example, Hans Kauffmann, "?ber 'rinascere,' 'Rinascita' und einige Stilmerkmale der Quattrocentobaukunst," Historische Zeitschrift 8 (1981): 127-128. Howard Burns ("Un disegno architettonico di Alberti e la questione del rapporto fra Brunelleschi e Alberti," in F Hippo Brunelleschi. La sua opera e il suo tempo [Florence, 1980], p. 95) argues that such a conception, although generally accepted, errs through its neglect of the flexibility of Alberti's approach, derived in large part from his conception of ornament as "secondary." In</page><page sequence="4">10 RES 23 SPRING 1993 The absence of this concept of facade from Alberti's architectural treatise is all the more remarkable because he makes frequent use of the term fades, the standard Latin word for "face." But he employs fades for the entire aspect of a building, envisaged as much in plan as in elevation, never only of the front plane. There was good classical authority for this, as Alberti surely was aware. In his Attic Nights, Aulus Gellius insists on an originary meaning of the word fades, grounded in an etymological argument of the kind congenial to Alberti: because it is related to the word for making (faciendo), it should mean the "makeup" (factura) of something.9 The appeal to this passage, which has no direct architectural reference, is consistent with the abstractness of Alberti's architectural thinking, evident in his particular conception of architectural organicity, as revealed through his use of the body metaphor. This informs the sense of the central and very complex notion of concinnitas, which expresses the resolution of mathematical values throughout a building and the ideal norms underlying natural and social process.10 Such conceptual abstractness, related to a concern with the overall unity of any architectural composition, is consistent with and even requires the Gellian connotations of the notion of "face." Certainly Alberti does not entirely neglect facade design: he recommends gable motifs or pediments in association with the main entrance of a grand residence as an ennobling sign?an interesting anticipation of the temple-front facade developed by Palladio and others, although not for urban architecture.11 But Alberti is thinking of the entrance sequence; his concern is overwhelmingly with plan rather than with elevations, although he gives attention to marking major thresholds within a building or its larger analogue, the city. In this fundamental respect, Alberti faithfully, if covertly, respects the position of Vitruvius, whose failure, from a Renaissance perspective, to deal with the issue of the facade set difficult problems for sixteenth-century architects and reinforced for centuries an idealizing current of architectural writing that maintained, against the demands of experience, the unity of the architectural composition.12 However, Alberti's recommendation of the pediment over a palace entrance is connected to the development of the idea of the facade, for he draws attention to the operation of an element deprived of its functional derivation as a signifier. This certainly is consistent with his procedure at the Palazzo Rucellai, for instance, which involved the cunning manipulation of different kinds of sign: heraldic, emblematic, and architectural.13 The classicizing facade itself, with all its cultural and social connotations, appears as a distinctive and powerful signifier; this, rather than its formal influence, is the real importance of the Rucellai facade, although its lessons were not truly learned for many years. Renaissance theory never caught up with contemporary practice. The orders were discussed obsessively, but the facade was not, although often it provided a conspicuous field for the display of orders.14 The term facciata appears in Filarete's treatise, but without theoretical elaboration, as if he were unaware of its disturbing implications and had simply taken it from northern Italian workshop usage.15 Francesco di Giorgio uses the term fades to mean "elevation," whether of a courtyard or the entrance front of the other words, Alberti is here rescued from his (modernist) critics and revealed as himself a true proto-modernist, for whom ornament is a mere supplement to an essential architecture. The problem with this debate is its reliance on an inadequately theorized and historicized notion of "facade." On the Tempio Malatestiano, especially in relation to wider conceptions of boundary and threshold, see Charles Burroughs, From Signs to Design: Environmental Process and Reform in Early Renaissance Rome (Cambridge, Mass., 1990), pp. 210-216. 9. The instances of Alberti's use of fades are collected in Hans Karl L?cke, Alberti Index (Munich, 1979), 3:450ff. Compare Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, ed. M. Hertz (Leipzig, 1886), 1:112: "Quidam faciem esse hominis putant os tantum et oculos et genas, quod Graeci prosopon dicunt; quando faci?s sit forma omnis et modus et factura quaedam corporis totius, a faciendo dicta, ut ab aspectu species et a fingendo figura." On Alberti's use of etymological arguments, see Burroughs (1990), p. 183. 10. Leon Battista Alberti, Dell'architettura, ed. S. Orlandi and P. Portoghesi (Milan, 1966), 1:15; 2:81 Iff. Alberti's ideas surely were operative in the planning, however intermittent, of the Palazzo Ducale at Urbino as well as in Renaissance characterizations of the building. C. W. Westfall ("Chivalric Decoration: The Palazzo Ducale in Urbino as a Political Statement," in Henry Mill?n and Linda Nochlin, eds., Art and Architecture in the Service of Politics [Cambridge, Mass., 1978], pp. 29, 43 n. 29) notes that none of the early descriptions deals with the facades, whereas all emphasize functionally and spatially distinct zones of the palatial complex. Westfall does not pursue the implications of this perception. 11. Alberti (1966), 2:808 (IX.4), cf. 616 (Vil.11). 12. James S. Ackerman, "The Face of Palazzo Chiericati," in M.

Spencer (1965), 1:146 (XI, fol. 84r): Filarete distinguishes different house types according to a social hierarchy; they are characterized by different base proportions expressed in the ground plan, and associated with the Greek orders. As Spencer notes, these proportions are not expressed in the respective facades.

Of sixteenth-century architects, Sebastiano Serlio came closer than his contemporaries to an understanding of the challenge mounted by the demand for architectural self representation to Vitruvian orthodoxy, although he is often classed as a thoroughgoing Vitruvian at a time of increasing reverence for the ancient treatise; in the apologetic preface to his book of portal designs, Serlio excuses his own departure from orthodoxy in response to the demand for the display of escutcheons, emblems, and other markers of social position.17 The facade, then, did not appear as a theme or problem in architectural theory of the Renaissance. Yet by the early sixteenth century, the term facciata was in fairly standard use in Italy; indeed, various ancient buildings and motifs served as models for architects wishing to design a classicizing facade and finding no guidance in Vitruvius.18 This evolution in architectural practice betrays a conceptual shift with clear relevance to the operation of the body metaphor in architecture. Most important, it introduced a new anthropomorphic dimension: the face is part of the body, implying the relatedness of other body and building parts or "members." However, the distinctness of the facade implies the existence of an architectural body separate from it and, as such, incompatible with the demand for organicity. One kind of anthropomorphism, in other words, disrupted another. An inventive response to the problem can be found in the Four Books on Architecture of Andrea Palladio. Palladio's insistence on the centrality of the organic metaphor in architecture involves a generally Aristotelian appeal to the abstract category of nature, although he gives examples related to the Vitruvian idea of the imitation in stone of an originary timber architecture rather than to the metaphor of the human body.19 When indeed he refers to the metaphor of the human body, he reverses the direction of the metaphor by relating the distinction of private and public zones within a building to that between the noble and ignoble parts of the body, not in themselves but as customarily kept open to view or concealed.20 This implies, use of facciata, see, for example, cases of 1473 (Richard Schofield, ed., Giovanni Antonio Amedeo: i document! [Como, 1989], 99f.). I am grateful to Joanne Bernstein for this reference. 16. Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Trattati di architettura, ingegneria e arte militare, ed. C. and L.

Sebastiano Serlio's Libro estraordinario (1st ed., Lyons, 1551) was published as Book VI in editions of Serlio's work from 1585. I consulted Tutte Vopere, ed. G. D. Scamozzi (Venice, 1619), preface to Book VI, unpaginated. Note that Serlio insists that the proportional values of the canonical elements, however fragmented or deformed, remain as recommended by Vitruvius; anthropometry, in other words, survives the demise of anthropomorphism. Indeed, as Onians (1988), pp. 280-283, has stressed, Serlio treats rustication and other ornamental features as a mere mask dressing up the pure architecture beneath; Onians compares this to the contemporary courtly fashion of masquerades (Onians errs in relating Serlio's ideas only to his experience of France, rather than to his insight into the practical limits of classicism). For Serlio's awareness of the social matrix of facade design, see Book VII.62 (Serlio 1619, 156). A similar concern appears in Barbara's distinction between two kinds of dispositio in Vitruvius, one responding to chance and necessity, and the other to the skill and knowledge of the architect; see B.

Palladio associated the Tuscan order (following Vitruvius, 4.7.99; ed. Fensterbusch, pp. 194-197), the simplest and closest to the origin of all the orders, with Vitruvius's araeostyle system (3.3.71; ed. Fensterbusch, pp. 144-147) involving especially wide column spacing that necessitated a timber architrave (as realized in the dependencies of Palladio's Villa Badoer); see now James S.

Significantly, he does not refer specifically to the face of the building, maintaining instead an ultimately Vitruvian model of functional organ ?city. Palladio raises here a crucial, although rarely articulated, issue in Renaissance architectural practice, the expression of thresholds of social and cultural difference. This is clearly connected to the discourse of the facade, for the linguistic and conceptual shift undergone by the term "facade" was symptomatic of deeper transformations, which were manifested nowhere more clearly than in the built environment. In 1475 the King of Naples made a state visit to Rome and joined Pope Sixtus IV in a procession through the streets. According to a contemporary report, he warned the pope that he would never be master of the notoriously unruly city unless he had the many porticoes and other projecting buildings demolished, since they provided convenient sites for concealment and ambush.21 Indeed, the late-medieval urban environment had been distinguished by street porticoes and similar structures that mediated between the street and the building, between public and private space. They had been sites of various ceremonies witnessed by the neighborhood and were used for the display of heraldic shields and other markers of status and affiliation. These porticoes and loggias were absent from the Renaissance built environment; activities formerly associated with them evidently disappeared or migrated into the palace interior, especially the courtyard. The early modern palace facade, therefore, marked a rupture between public and private zones. Clearly, this development resulted from long-term shifts rather than from a particular ruler's strategic decision to make the city transparent to a panoptic eye. The disappearance of street porticoes entailed a certain impoverishment of the urban environment in experiential terms, but the emphasis on facades that screened domestic space while addressing the public realm gave new opportunities for architectural expression. These, needless to say, featured the architectural orders, the emblematic resonances and expressive possibilities of which were zealously researched by the architects of the Roman Renaissance, notably Donato Bramante.22 Bramante shared the deep interest of many contemporary intellectuals in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, which, as understood in the Renaissance, merged the properties of language and imagery, engendering an unparalleled communicative and even epistemological power. For a prominent portal in the Vatican, indeed, Bramante proposed an inscription in mock Egyptian pictograms; he perhaps otherwise shared the widely diffused concern to develop a modern picture writing based on the ancient Egyptian model.23 Bramante's earliest major project in Rome, the cloister of S. Maria della Pace of 1500-1504, is a remarkable piece of architectural bravura, in which various registers of architectural communication are deployed. The cloister's enclosing facades suggest a geometrically ordered, ideal urban environment (fig. 4), in which Bramante brought off the conceit of simultaneously combining four architectural orders in a two-story building, thus going well beyond the ancient model of superimposition.24 In addition, Bramante took the revolutionary step of adapting for contemporary purposes Vitruvius's association of the classical orders with deities of diverse character and gender; most notably, he maintained an emphasis on just one of the orders, the matronly Ionic that alludes to the Mother of God and characterizes the building as a whole. Indeed, Bramante's works at this time suggest a new degree of systematization of the orders as an architectural code. Bramante used the orders at the courtyard of S. Maria della Pace, however, in two fundamentally distinct ways. He deployed four orders in juxtaposition but at the same time contrasted the maternal Ionic on the ground floor with the chaste Corinthian of the monks' private quarters in the upper story. One order alludes to the fertile body of the Madonna; the other, to the abstinence of the monks, whose bodily condition was both a metaphor for and a guarantee of their spiritual life. 21.

S. Maria della Pace, Rome, courtyard. Photo: Courtesy of Alinari/Art Resource, New York. The relation of the orders at S. Maria della Pace is both syntagmatic and paradigmatic.25 They are contiguous elements of a built fabric at the same time as they carry meaning through their place in a differentiated code. It is useful here to refer to Roman Jakobson's definition of poetry as the projection of paradigmatic relations onto the syntagmatic axis, involving a condensation of concepts.26 This aptly describes Bramante's achievement in the confined, carefully controlled architectural environment of a cloister. However, a similar process can be followed in a very different contemporary urban context that, although marked by artistic achievement of the highest order, contrasts utterly with the unified and solemn character of the Pace courtyard. In 1499 a new street, the Via Alessandrina, was cut through the so-called Borgo between the Ponte S. Angelo, then the boundary of Rome proper, and the Vatican palace (fig. 5). It was a prototype of the parade streets, lined by grand palaces, that appeared in the Renaissance in association with the expanding princely courts of the period. In social-historical terms, it Figure 5. Via Alessandrina and Piazza S. Jacopo Scossacavalli. Detail of Etienne Dup?rac, view of Rome (1577). B.M. Maps 23805(8).

The distinction, originated by de Saussure, between the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes of language received its most influential formulation in Roman Jakobson's discussion in a paper of 1956 of what he called the m?tonymie and metaphoric axes of language (Jakobson, Selected Writings [The Hague, 1971], pp. 239 259).

As an architectural historical landmark, it manifests an unprecedented variety and intensity of facade treatment, involving the deployment of the orders and other devices and motifs in a complex play of allusion and occasional critique. Comment on the total environment of the street must be tentative, because many of its facades and even buildings did not survive long; the major monuments are well documented, however, and some still exist. The evidence, especially the polemical response of Raphael to Bramante's palace design, indicates the appearance in Rome of an intense architectural discourse that is the necessary context for the discussion of any major design projects of the first half of the sixteenth century in Rome.27 The Via Alessandrina has hitherto drawn the attention of scholars mainly for its status as an early example of a planned street axially aligned on an important urban feature, in this case the portal of the Vatican palace.28 The street was created by edict: in 1499 Pope Alexander VI decreed the layout of a straight processional thoroughfare through the Borgo, the area between the Vatican and the Ponte S. Angelo. Considerable demolition and leveling was carried out, and the property holders along the route were bidden to erect within just two months buildings seven cannae (15.64 meters) high.29 Evidently, the pope was concerned with the appearance of uniformity in time for the Jubilee of 1500, but it is difficult to see how the terms of Alexander's bull could be satisfied except through the erection of effective facades that screened whatever lay behind. In its very conception, the resulting environment was a theaterlike space set off by impressive urban scenery appropriate for the diverse and lavish ceremonies, spectacles, and festive events relished by the pope and his court.30 The papal vision of uniform street facades in the Via Alessandrina soon was annulled. In particular, Bramante, newly arrived in Rome, received perhaps as early as 1501 the opportunity to design a palace for a conspicuous site and to explore and display ideas about architectural and environmental signification that were to be fundamental in the architecture of the opening century and beyond.31 The site already was marked by the stark and concentrated contrast of two formidable palaces, representative examples of the two major palace types of fifteenth-century Rome, across a newly laid out piazza, traversed by the Via Alessandrina. This contrast of palaces was noted already by the contemporary humanist Paolo Cortesi in a discussion of the residence appropriate to a cardinal. The passage appears in Cortesi's work on the office of cardinal and the lifestyle appropriate to it;32 as such it is an example of a new literary genre, the manual of courtly manners, that was elaborated especially in Roman intellectual circles in the early sixteenth century. It is of evident 27.

The street is discussed, somewhat in passing, by various scholars; specific studies are currently being prepared by Eunice Howe and Richard Ingersoll. 30. Frommel (1984), pp. 226-228. 31. In opposition to the earlier consensus that the palace should be dated ca. 1510, Frommel (1973), 2: 85, published documentary evidence for a date at the beginning of the sixteenth century. More recently, however, Borsi (1989), p. 322, has accepted Frommel's dating hypothesis for the palace but argues on stylistic grounds for a later date for the facade. Borsi also emphasizes the caesaropapist inflection given in the pontificate of Julius II to the courtly enclave of the Via Alessandrina. Onians (1988), p. 237, connects the choice of the Doric order here to a supposed predilection for this order on the part of Julius II; this is too easy an explanation. There is some uncertainty about the exact location of the palace's main facade, which Arnaldo Bruschi ("Edifici privati di Bramante a Roma: Palazzo Castellesi e Palazzo Caprini," Palladio 4 [1989], p. 35) places on the Piazza Scossacavalli, although all other students of the building locate it on the Via Alessandrina. It is surely unlikely that the spirit of Alexander's foundation bull for the street would have been flouted so emphatically and so early. The main entrance and facade of the palace that incorporated Bramante's building later in the sixteenth century were certainly on the street. 32. The text of the relevant section of Paolo Cortesi, De cardinalatu, is published in English translation with a commentary in John D'Amico and Kathleen Weil-Garris, eds., The Renaissance Cardinal's Ideal Palace: A Chapter from Cortesi's 'De cardinalatu' (Rome, 1980).</page><page sequence="9">Burroughs: The building's face and the Herculean paradigm 15 iMBBBnBVlBBBlSKTnLS^MSBaBB?BBBH^ . -?

For the most part, Cortesi follows Alberti and Vitruvius, emphasizing the properties of the plan and the hierarchic distribution of interior spaces, especially along the main entrance route. Yet the effect of the facade (Cortesi does not use the term; he refers to "exterior decoration") was too important in the politically and socially volatile city of Rome for questions of its design to be ignored; indeed, the very security of a palace during an urban riot could, in Cortesi's view, depend on the impressiveness of its facade.33 Cortesi's contrast of current palace types surely reflects the conspicuous topographical juxtaposition of two major examples. The Palazzo Domenico della Rovere (fig. 6), often identified as the Palazzo dei Penitenzieri, had a tower, crenellations, regularly spaced cross-mullioned windows, and a blank, plastered wall surface carrying incised decoration (so called sgraffito), all motifs typical of a specifically Roman early Renaissance tradition of palace architecture (cf. Palazzo Venezia).34 The Palazzo Castellesi (now Giraud-Torlonia) was built just after the construction of the Via Alessandrina (fig. 7). It represented a newer, more sophisticated palace type developed in Florence and Urbino, distinguished by the superimposition of the classical orders on a masonry facade, a motif adapted from the Colosseum, as Cortesi notes (cf. the Canceller?a, also cited by Cortesi).35 Since the effect of one facade depends on the effect of cut and carved stone and that of the other on applied, two dimensional decoration, Cortesi characterizes the 33.

Bramante, whose site faced onto both the piazza and the Via Alessandrina, probably knew Cortesi and his writings; in any case, he made the contrast of art and nature integral to the design of his facade. Bramante's building on the Via Alessandrina owed its fame for many years to Raphael's later occupation of it; once known as the House of Raphael, it is currently referred to as the Palazzo Capri ni after its first occupant, Bramante's patron (fig. 8). Although it soon disappeared into the bulk of a larger palace and is known only from graphic images, it inaugurated a palace type of enormous significance in the history of Western architecture. It was distinguished, first of all, by its conspicuous deployment of an order?in this case, Doric?above an assertively rusticated basement story. The facade articulation suggests a contrast of two main stories, although the grand, paired Doric half columns front both the piano nobile and a mezzanine floor above, whose windows are concealed in the frieze. This disjunction of apparent and actual interior layout?along with the use of plaster to mimic the effect of rusticated stone in the lower story?makes this building a flagrant case of facadism. The increase in scale and plasticity, however, over the motif of shallow superimposed pilasters on the adjacent Palazzo Castellesi, expresses a monumental, even colossal, quality of crucial importance in the development of an architectural rhetoric suitable for the increasingly centralized, even absolutist, political regimes of the time.36 The Palazzo Caprini displayed Bramante's interest in and sophisticated use of the masculine Doric order, associated by Vitruvius with powerful and virile gods 36. On the Caprini Doric as a colossal order, see, for example, Erik Forssman, D?rico, i?nico, corinzio nel I'architettura del Rinascimento (Rome and Bari, 1973), pp. 31 ff.

Pietro in Montorio, where, as Bruschi has argued, Saint Peter was celebrated as a Christian Hercules.37 The Herculean associations of the order were strengthened at the Caprini palace by the marked leap in scale; they would be vitally important, as argued below, for subsequent secular architecture in Rome. The facade of the Palazzo Caprini divides into two horizontal zones. The Doric order, whatever its paradigmatic aspect, is placed in an emphatic syntagmatic relation to the rusticated basement beneath. Various connotations can be plausibly ascribed to the superimposed zones of the basement and the piano nobile; certainly they denote the opposed worlds of labor and exchange and of refinement and authority. Both literal and metaphorical inclusions of the human body in architecture are in question: the lower zone of the facade is incomplete without the bodies of the shopkeepers, framed in the openings of their botteghe as they work at their crafts; the high, balustraded windows above, however, await the appearance of persons engaged in the leisurely surveillance of the urban scene, whose bodies were perhaps imagined as formally echoed in the columns that frame them.38 37. Bruschi (1977), pp. 130f.; Borsi (1989), p. 253. For an alternative reading of the Doric of the Palazzo Caprini as evocative of the bourgeois status of the patron, see Forssman (1973), p. 32. This hypothesis is open to two significant lines of critique: that it involves the assignment to the orders of fixed architectural and social value, as if they constituted a standardized code; and that it entails a hierarchical ranking of Doric as the lowest, although strongest, of the Greek orders. Such a ranking accords with most early modern practice but upends Vitruvius's hierarchy (De architectura 1.2.13; ed. Fensterbusch, pp. 38-41), which privileges the Doric. Bramante followed Vitruvius in this, as Onians (1988), pp. 235-239, recently emphasized, arguing that Bramante's usage relates to the prominence given the Dorian mode by the contemporary musical theorist Gaffurio. This essentialist position is unconvincing: architectural values, even in the case of the orders, are notoriously imprecise and must always be deciphered relationally (i.e., metonymically) in terms of a specific array of forms and their contextual entailments. This is especially true of the Palazzo Caprini. 38. This already is hinted by Bruschi (1977), p. 174.</page><page sequence="12">18 RES 23 SPRING 1993 The horizontal division of this facade into zones is often understood as expressing the contrast of nature and art or artifice, symbolized by the smoothly finished architectural decor and the rough stone. Such a reading is corroborated by Cortesi's introduction of just this contrast in an architectural context, as noted above. The upper zone is expressive of art, further, in terms of a somewhat restricted reference not to the production but to the consumption of artifacts by a leisured class; indeed, in a mingling of classical architectural and Marxian terminology, it can be said to function as a superstructure over a "basis" associated with productive labor. This dichotomy is subtly subverted, however, within the formal economy of Bramante's design, for on closer inspection the "superstructure" is not sharply opposed to the "basis" beneath, but rather seems to grow out of a quasi-natural foundation, as is indicated by an arrangement of blocks that asserts a subsidiary but unmistakable vertical ordering.39 The facade therefore constitutes a model of hierarchic social relations and, at the same time, of their grounding in the natural order of things. In short, the Capri ni facade asserts both the naturalization of social difference and its transcendence within a unifying architectural organicity. Nowhere in the Renaissance built environment are the ideological resonances of architectural form clearer than here. Paradoxically, however, the realm of nature evoked by the Capri ni basement is highly artificial: it is associated with the production and exchange of commodities, and the effect of heavy stone was achieved in molded plaster. The socio-architectural stability implied here is, at best, fragile. The underlying model of Bramante's building was the ancient Roman ?nsula, the urban block with apartments over shops that was identified incorrectly in the Renaissance as a palace (the problem of ancient models for palace architecture, especially facades, was noted above).40 The insula type was expressive of the social relations of the ancient city, providing further grounding for the social and architectural structuring of the Caprini facade. This also refers, however, to the contemporary city. Basement shops, such as those prominent here, were a common feature in Roman palaces, although rare elsewhere. Perhaps they reflected the persistent feudal aspect of Roman society, still largely dominated by powerful clans who could count on the fierce loyalty of men of different social status in the settling of factional conflict. These patterns of association and rivalry contributed much to the notoriously unruly tenor of life in Rome and underlay the repeated attempts of papal regimes to establish and manifest order in the city streets or the rural hinterland. The popes resorted variously to the use or threat of force or, as contemporaries explicitly noted, to the production through architecture or public ceremonial of environmental restraints.41 In Bramante's palace, however, all potential conflict appears transcended in a pacific architectural hierarchy evocative of the Albertian analogy of the house and city, the one a small version of the other, and both ideally subject to benevolent yet firm patriarchal control.42 The rusticated zone of the Caprini constitutes, then, a "natural" support for the social and cultural superstructure erected over it while expressing subjection to an ordering and controlling principle. Such a formulation was not foreign to Renaissance culture, and it is possible that Bramante knew one of Alberti's short parables (the Intercoenales or "dinner pieces") about the revolt of the foundation stones of a temple against the columns they support; the result, needless to say, is disaster for all.43 With its fusion of human and social metaphors, Bramante's facade is a 39. Frommel (1973), 1:95. Frommel's entirely formalist concern is that classical values such as unity and harmony should be assigned to Bramante's architectural composition. 40. The specific model seems to be the tabernae of the Forum of Julius Caesar, for example, as represented in a drawing attributed to Fra Giocondo (Uffizi 1537A; see B. M. Apollonj-Ghetti, "II prospetto del palazzo romano del primo '500," in G. Giovannoni et al., eds., Atti del Primo Congresso di Storia del I'Architettura [Rome, 1936], p. 239). For other possible models in the same general area of the city, see Borsi (1989), pp. 322ff. 41. The example of Nicholas V, as transmitted in Manetti's influential hagiography, was fundamental; see C. W. Westfall, In This Most Perfect Paradise: Alberti, Nicholas V, and the Invention of Conscious Urban Planning in Rome, 1447-55 (University Park, Penn., 1974), pp. 109ff., noting the semiotic aspect of Nicholas's refortification of Rome and the Leonine City.

The parable "Templum" is one of the Intercoenales published by Eugenio Garin, "Alcune intercenali in?dite," Rinascimento series 2, 4 (1964): 216ff. The story begins, "Nam evenit quidem ut lapides, qui pro fundamentis templi substituti iacebant, inepta quadam rerum novarum cupiditate ducti in huiusmodi sermones inter se irrumperent . . ."; the stones go on to detail the luxurious life of the stones of the superstructure in comparison with their own existence of toil and discomfort. The temple itself was dedicated, Alberti tells us, to the goddess Tussis ("Cough") and was one of the finest and most revered shrines of ancient Etruria. For an English translation, see L. B.

The formal aspects of the Caprini facade proved most congenial to the patrons and architects of palaces in Rome and beyond. In the Via Alessandrina itself, however, the type was first modified and then polemically abandoned by Raphael, who after Bramante's death in 1514 inherited his position as leading architect of Rome and, especially, the papal court.44 He built two palaces on the street for patrons? one a doctor, the other an artist and connoisseur?who owed their position entirely to favor at court. The earlier of the two designs, that for the Palazzo Jacopo da Brescia (still extant in slightly modified form), converts the dyadic order of the Caprini palace into a triadic scheme allowing the exterior expression of the major floors, of which it becomes an index (fig. 9).45 Otherwise, the love of the theater that pervaded the refined and pleasure-loving court culture under Leo X is clearly echoed in the narrow side facade, facing up the Via Alessandrina toward the Vatican, with its triumphal arch motif and papal arms, and in the perspectival adjustments accommodating a raking view of the main facade. The facade of the Palazzo Jacopo da Brescia on the Via Alessandrina, indeed the street as a whole, echoes the theatrical scenery of the time, notably that designed by Raphael himself; in particular, it recalls the serried palaces of the Tragic Scene, one of three hierarchically ordered genres of scenery described by Vitruvius and developed by Renaissance antiquarians and architects.46 Figure 9. Palazzo Jacopo da Brescia, facade formerly on Borgo Nuovo (Via Alessandrina), Rome. Photo: Courtesy of Alinari/Art Resource, New York. The definitive formulation of the Tragic Scene, a fictive version of the architecture of a Renaissance court enclave (fig. 10), is that published in 1545 by Serlio, whose publications were greatly indebted to material produced and collected, notably by Baldassare Peruzzi, in the period of the development of the Via Alessandrina.47 Raphael's other palace, the Palazzo Branconio dell' Aquila (fig. 11), represents a complete rejection of the Caprini type for a far more complex composition 44. On the specific character of the Palazzo Branconio as a critique of Bramante's building, see the venerable but useful formal analyses of Wolfgang Lotz, "Mannerism in Architecture: Changing Aspects," in The Renaissance and Mannerism: Acts of the 20th International Congress of the History of Art (Princeton, N.J., 1963), 2:239, 246; Howard Hibbard, "Maderno, Michelangelo, and Cinquecento Tradition," in St/7 und ?berlieferung in der Kunst des Abendlandes.

Peirce's trichotomy of sign types (icon, index, symbol) is useful here, in that while Bramante's palace constitutes an iconic/diagrammatic representation of social relations in the city as in the house, Raphael's tend to be transparent to the inner arrangement of the house in stories but to carry extensive symbolic material.

This fashion, however, did not find favor with certain patrons, who had other than economic reasons for their preference for more restrained and even severe facade treatments.49 In their variety and experimental ism, the palaces of the Via Alessandrina reflected the refined and competitive court culture that flourished under Pope Leo X Medici. Architecture, especially in a courtly enclave such as the Borgo, constituted a privileged mode of self-representation and advertisement, indicating a patron's social status, cultural horizon, and actual or desired position in the labile world of the court. It is no accident that a close friend and occasional collaborator of Raphael's was Baldassare Castiglione, author of The Book of the Courtier, the most celebrated and sophisticated of texts on courtly behavior, which emphasized both socially appropriate behavior and forms of dissimulation and masking.50 In this discursive context, the palace street constituted a physical expression or even image of the court to which it was necessarily and intimately connected.51 The courtiers of Leo X, members of one of many 48.

At the same time, they entered into a double game of representations with their peers, balancing expressions of solidarity and rivalry. During Leo's pontificate, the Via Alessandrina palaces tended to carry the Medici arms, an obvious sign of loyalty to the pope but also of cohesiveness with regard to their neighbors, whatever particularist ambitions might inform the distinctive palace designs. A shift of focus from the courtly enclave of the Borgo to the city proper will reveal a higher degree of cohesiveness conveyed by a group of palaces, built between 1517 and 1534, which share a greater or lesser degree of dependence on the Palazzo Caprini type. Following its abandonment in the Via Alessandrina, this type now migrated into a very different milieu. Unlike the Borgo palaces, these were distributed across the city in accordance with a traditional pattern of urban settlement. Late-medieval neighborhoods had been marked by the social heterogeneity of the population clustered around and often within the residential compound of the leading family of the quarter.52 The coincidence of topographical concentration with architectural and aesthetic disparities that characterized the Via Alessandrina is reversed here; these palaces, although dispersed, display clear indications of architectural and social solidarity. All carry the Doric order above a rusticated basement, although all have three-story elevations in which the colossal scale of Bramante's Doric piano nobile is sacrificed. As a result, the contrast of basement and order is less pronounced, so that the whole facade acquires a Doric/Tuscan, indeed a Herculean, quality. The group of palaces concerned includes conspicuous examples: the Palazzi Alberini Cicciaporci, Missini-Ossoli, Stati-Maccarani, and Cafarelli-Vidoni. All were built for representatives or, in one case, allies of the Roman patriciate, a class whose persistent claim to their traditional authority and status within the city in the face of papal opposition and neglect has been much emphasized in recent accounts of urban development in Rome.53 The economic basis of their status lay in the pastoral hinterland of Rome, with its extensive transhumance system controlled by entrepreneurs known as bovattieri, or stockmen, and organized into a guild of this name.54 The bovattieri and their allies dominated the municipal government of Rome and, mindful of the glorious epoch of the free Roman commune of the fourteenth century, resented and intermittently resisted papal encroachment on their traditional powers and privileges. Against this background, the Caprini palace type, with its specifically Roman associations, became tinged with a broadly republican ideological resonance. This also may explain the popularity of the type with northern Italian urban elites, including many patrons of both Sanmicheli and Palladio.55 The development of architecture in the 1520s was interrupted first by the election of an unsympathetic pope, the strict Dutchman Hadrian VI, then by various financial and other crises, and finally and fatally by the sack of Rome of 1527. It surely was as a gesture of the recovery of his family and his class from this traumatic event that by 1533, only six years after the sack and his father's consequent death, Pietro Massimi commissioned a magnificent palace from Baldassare 52.

This was not just a mannerist ?eu d'esprit, for the result was an even greater emphasis on the Doric order than at the Caprini, while the ground-floor portico also recalled the patrician compounds of late-medieval Rome, the period of the free commune and of the establishment of deliberative institutions still ensconced on the Campidoglio, although now largely bereft of power.57 Peruzzi's design therefore brilliantly combined two distinct but equally ideologically potent models, one ancient, one medieval, as was appropriate for a family that boasted prominence in the traditional institutions of the city as well as descent from the earliest inhabitants of Rome. In particular, the association of the architecture of the Palazzo Massimo with Hercules is explicit; indeed, the family claimed descent from Hercules, who had sojourned in Rome long enough to become a local hero and to engage in a productive dalliance with a local woman.58 Hercules had come to Rome driving a herd of cattle, which was stolen from him by the monstrous Cacus, whom Hercules overthrew. The subsequent sacrifice of one of the animals inaugurated the famous Ara Maxima and, indeed, Roman cult practice in general. Hercules's shrine was located in the Forum Boarium, the ancient cattle market, not far from its medieval and Renaissance successor, the Campo Vaccino in the area of the ancient Forum, which was a major focus of the business life of the bovattieh.59 It is not surprising to find Hercules, himself a bovattiere, or stockman, in his Roman legend, 56.

In contrast, Frommel (in Fagiolo and Madonna [1987], p. 245) asserts that the portico design alludes merely to that of the previous palace on the site; otherwise his analysis is entirely formalist. 58.

She notes that the name Forum Boarium sometimes was transferred from the ancient site to the Forum Romanum, as a translation of the standard early modern name of the site as the Campo Vaccino. The earliest documented reference to a Piazza di Campo Vaccino in the area of the Forum is dated 1563.</page><page sequence="17">Burroughs: The building's face and the Herculean paradigm 23 associated with the patriciate of Rome. Although Hercules was particularly associated with the Massimi family, statues of the demigod occurred with remarkable consistency in the sculpture collections of other patricians (one belonged to Michelangelo's friend Tommaso Cavalieri).60 And the famous figure of Pasquino, the battered ancient statue that served in the imagination of the people as the spokesman for a range of scurrilous and critical opinions about the mighty of the city, was sometimes identified with Hercules, not least in anti-Farnese diatribes.61 The evidence indicates a patrician enthusiasm for Hercules with unmistakable political overtones, quite separate from the better known but equally ideological Hercules cults of various political dynasties and aristocratic families. Herculean references abound at the Palazzo Massimo. The lion of the Massimi coat of arms refers both to Hercules and to the traditional emblematic beast of the free Roman commune. In a fresco in the main hall, Hercules appears with his consort and child in the Arcadian landscape of pre-urban Rome. The Herculean Doric columns of the portico frame a space crowded with leonine and Herculean allusions, like the lions' paws of the stone benches; Hercules himself appears in the stucco decoration of at least one of the lateral niches. Moreover, in the portico ceiling above the entrance route appears a very large coat of arms of the Massimi family, with a helm carrying a scene of a naked man, probably Hercules, in conflict with a centaur (according to Dante, Cacus was a centaur),62 and adjacent to a relief of the child Hercules strangling serpents. The very motif of the curving, Doric portico accords with the Renaissance reconstruction of the Temple of the Unvanquished Hercules (Hercules Victor) at the Forum Boarium as a circular Doric building.63 In other words, the Palazzo Massimo itself asserts a Herculean presence, with strong Ghibelline or even republican connotations, at a conspicuous point on the papal processional route through Rome. At the center of Roman municipal life, the Campidoglio, further evidence of the patrician cult of Hercules can be found. Here stood the bronze cult statue of the hero from the temple in the Forum Boarium; it was one of the few known statues that corresponded to ancient descriptions of them in their original locations. In 1568 the placement of this statue in the Palazzo dei Conservatori was modified, a sign of the continuing concern with its effective display, but of particular interest because the individual responsible, at the time the chief municipal officer (conservatore), was Tommaso Cavalieri.64 Moreover, the Palazzo dei Conservatori preserved a number of inscriptions from the shrine in the Forum Boarium recording the existence of an ancient municipal cult of Hercules, one perhaps echoed, mutatis mutandis, in the Renaissance center of city government.65 The rebuilt palaces accommodating that government were planned by Michelangelo to carry a balustrade on which, against the sky, stood several statues of ancient deities. Prominent among these was a statue of Hercules (fig. 13). 60.

It surely is possible that the niche in the retaining wall behind the site of the Palazzo Capitol i no that appears in early representations of the remodeling of the Campidoglio (the Bufalini plan, the views in Braunschweig and the Louvre [Ackerman 1986, figs. 63, 64]) was intended to contain the bronze statue of Hercules from the Forum Boarium.

D'Onofrio, followed by Vittozzi and Presicce, argues that a statue of a lion goring a horse was destined for the niche. This accords with the ideological associations of the statue in question, but the niche was evidently of the appropriate size and proportions for a single, upright figure that also would complement the axially related equestrian group of Marcus Aurelius and, perhaps, echo the statue of Pallas Athena in a niche at the rear of the courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori, visible through the entrance of the palace (Vittozzi and Presicce 1991, p. 108). Vittozzi and Presicce admit (p. 90) that early representations of the Capitol i ne hill after the construction of the niche show the lion group adjacent to, not in, the niche.</page><page sequence="18">24 RES 23 SPRING 1993 ur?i;r,,i \' i .u.n m Figure 13.

Lafreri, ed., The Earl of Crawford's Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae (Rome, 1569), no. 199. Photo: Courtesy of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, Columbia University, New York. The evidence for this is a pair of engravings from 1568 and 1569 representing the Capitoline hill as transformed according to Michelangelo's designs, a transformation that lingered into the following century.66 One of the slight differences between the two versions is a change in the placement of the Hercules statue, perhaps a sign of continuing concern for the appropriate expression of the hero's link with the Campidoglio. In both engravings the statue is obviously modeled on the famous Farnese Hercules, which was not discovered until 1545, several years after the inception of the project to rebuild the Campidoglio.67 It is likely, however, that balustrade figures, including a Hercules, were foreseen at an early stage of the design process; if so, the Hercules figure may well have been based on the celebrated cult statue preserved in the palace of the city government. Changing circumstances brought about the later substitution with the Farnese type, an obvious gesture of homage to that powerful family. In one of the state rooms of the Conservatori palace, however, appears a different Hercules: a colossal statue of the hero is represented in a large fresco, dated 1569, of a republican Roman triumph, that of Aemilius Paullus. It clearly is not based on the Farnese statue.68 The palace itself is represented prominently in the imagined topography of Aemilius's procession, in which the ?mage of Hercules occupies a place of honor on one of the triumphal chariots. 66.

The statue of Hercules, mounted on a float, begins the procession; the hero carries the apples of the Hesperides, the usual allusion to the Golden Age, although in an earlier design he held his club. The latter arrangement may have recalled the Farnese Hercules type; the former is quite distinct. The presence of the Palazzo dei Conservatori in ancient Rome, partly to identify the mons Capitolinus, seems to corroborate the case for the municipal/republican character of the architecture, although it is true that a processional representation of this triumph in the carnival of 1536 was meant to honor Paul III, as namesake of Aemilius Paullus (Filippo Clementi, // carnevale Romano [Bologna, 1939], 1:208ff.; Mario Sanfilippo, // carnevale di Roma [Milan, 19911, p. 25). This was early in Paul's pontificate, however, before relations with the citizenry soured. The commission for the fresco, finally, was awarded by the city magistrates of the time, one of whom was Tommaso Cavalieri.</page><page sequence="19">Burroughs: The building's face and the Herculean paradigm 25 II. The Palazzo dei Conservatori: a Herculean facade The transformation of the Campidoglio involved the greatest facade project of the sixteenth century: the refacing of two major buildings, and the addition of a new building echoing one of the existing pair and creating, with them, the effect of a stage framed by grand, uniform architecture. In its essential aspects, the design was formulated by 1540, although its realization lagged and was not energetically pursued until the 1560s. The circumstances of the Campidoglio commission are familiar and can be briefly summarized.69 In 1536 the emperor Charles V made a state visit to Rome, less than ten years after his troops had devastated the city. His host was Pope Paul III Farnese, who had acceded in 1534. Elaborate preparations were made, especially along the processional route that, following the ancient Sacred Way, passed through the triumphal arches in the Forum; here, large-scale demolition freed the major ancient monuments from the accretions of centuries, leaving hundreds of people homeless, as Rabelais noted.70 Originally it was planned that Charles would visit the Capitoline hill, like other emperors before him, to be received in state by the representatives of the municipal government whose official palaces were located there. The municipal government planned elaborate decorations, about which little is known except that they were prospettive, a term that recalls the association of the hill with political theater and the formal qualities of the Serlian Tragic Scene.71 The imperial visit to the Campidoglio was canceled, however, and the procession skirted the hill on its route toward the papal enclave at the Vatican. The reasons for this decision are obscure; perhaps there was embarrassment at the shabby condition of the Campidoglio, or funds for the decorations were not forthcoming. It seems clear that the city government was concerned with the reform, even temporary, of the appearance of the Campidoglio but that this was not a priority of the pope's in 1535 and 1536.72 The following years were of enormous importance for the Campidoglio. The bronze equestrian statue of Constantine was brought to the hill, and Michelangelo, who claimed to be opposed to the whole idea, was put in charge of resiting it. It is usually assumed that this was a papal project, and that the transfer of the statue to the Campidoglio was the immediate occasion for the development of Michelangelo's famous scheme for a new piazza embraced on three sides by grand public buildings. The project, which originally involved only the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the public space in front of it, was originated by the city government, which could hardly have expected to realize it without papal support, given the power relations in the city and the sorry state of the city's budget.73 In the fall of 1537, the city council voted for the embellishment of the piazza and the existing Palazzo dei Conservatori, which was in sore need of restoration.74 This was the seat of the municipal administration, notably its elected leaders, the three conservatori. The other palace on the hill was the official residence of the chief judicial officer of the city, 69. For what follows see James S. Ackerman, The Architecture of Michelangelo, rev. ed. (Chicago and London, 1986), pp. 138-170; H?rmen Thies, Michelangelo, das Kapitol (Munich, 1982), esp. pp. 79, 194ff., presenting arguments for the early date of a unified Campidoglio project; Giulio Carlo Argan and Bruno Contardi, Michelangelo architetto (Milan, 1990), pp. 213-238, 252-263. The literature is enormous; the issues raised here must await discussion elsewhere. 70. Rabelais reported that more than two hundred buildings were destroyed (Hoff 1987, p. 21). 71. For a judicious discussion of the relationship of Michelangelo's Campidoglio project to contemporary scene design, see Irving Lavin, "The Campidoglio and Sixteenth-Century Stage Design," in Essays in Honor of Walter Friedlaender. Marsyas Supplement, 2 (New York, 1965), pp. 114-118. I thank Professor Lavin for this citation. In my view the characterization of Bruschi and others of the visual effect of the ensemble as "inverted perspective" is exaggerated (Arnaldo Bruschi, "Michelangelo in Campidoglio e l'invenzione dell'ordine gigante," Storia Architettura, quaderni di critica 4 [1979]: 11ff.). 72. Traditionally the Roman Ghibelline party, led by the Colonna clan, had supported the imperial cause and opposed the papacy (Burroughs 1990, pp. 82, 107, 111, 142). This was not a mere memory; in 1541 war was to break out between the pope and the Colonna (on the so-called Salt War, see below n. 77). It may be significant that the main ceremonial official of the Roman municipality, the gonfaloniere Giuliano Cesarini, who would have presided over Charles's visit to the Campidoglio, was a professional soldier who had served Charles V and been present at his coronation in Bologna in 1530; in 1534 he injured the governor of Rome in a sword fight (Clementi 1939, 1:212 with n. 2; Bonner Mitchell, The Majesty of the State: Triumphal Progresses of Foreign Sovereigns in Renaissance Italy [Florence, 1986], p. 145). Paul perhaps had substantial reasons to keep the emperor away from the Campidoglio. 73. For a concise statement of the conventional view, see Christoph L. Frommel, "Papal Policy: The Planning of Rome During the Renaissance," Journal of Interdisciplinary History 17 (1986): 339 365. For my discussion see the citation in n. 27 above. 74.

Every senator was a foreigner, however, whereas in the period in question the conservatori and other officials of the city government were citizens, always recruited from the rather narrow patrician elite. The oversight of the reconstruction campaign was delegated to a specially constituted commission of three patricians, all of whom had experience both in municipal administration and in architectural or street improvement projects. One of the three was the patron of the Palazzo Massimo aile Colonne, Pietro dei Massimi, whose palace has often been cited by architectural historians?although without referring to Massimi's role on the Campidoglio?as a model at least for the portico of the Palazzo dei Conservatori.75 The oversight committee soon was expanded by the addition of a fourth member, the famous diplomat and administrator Latino Giovenale Manetti. Manetti, also a Roman patrician, is known especially for his role in the extensive series of urban improvement projects carried out under Paul III. The fact that in this case he needed to negotiate his way onto the committee indicates once again the municipal character of the project. When Michelangelo's association with the project began is not clear; it is not documented until 1539, but from 1534 he had been resident in Rome and closely associated with Tommaso Cavalieri, a young but well-connected member of the patrician elite, whose generally republican ideals Michelangelo shared at the time. Moreover, in December 1537 Michelangelo received Roman citizenship; this may be the terminus ante quern of his appointment as architect at the Campidoglio. Work on the project was impeded by the municipal government's shortage of funds; this was a problem at the best of times, and the situation worsened with the terrible winters of 1538 and 1539 and with the famine and general economic crisis of those years. Nothing much was achieved until the years following 1542, when the project had been redefined to embrace the whole Campidoglio, including the Senator's Palace. The first work done involved the latter's double stair, facing the Vatican across the roofs of the city and the commanding gesture of Marcus Aurelius. The change may well have reflected papal pressure, although the vision of a magnificently unified Campidoglio was surely congenial to the city authorities, too.76 However, the war pursued in 1541 by the pope against rebellious elements within the papal states, notably the Roman Colonna clan and their allies, surely must have changed at least the style of Paul's administration of the city.77 The present focus, however, is the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the probable concerns of the commissioners of 1537. They wanted a more modern and impressive front?a true facade?added to an existing building whose substance would be affected little. They doubtless insisted, further, that any facade project should accommodate the two contrasting elements of the palace: the meeting rooms and ceremonial spaces of the city magistrates above, and the offices of the city's guilds, or some of them, on the ground floor. This was a double program; indeed, Michelangelo's scheme gave particular emphasis to the guild offices, whose entrances became conspicuous elements of the ground-floor portico. Finally, the commissioners wanted the Conservatori design related to a wider scheme involving the piazza and the siting of the equestrian statue. The emphasis on the guild offices is crucial, although it is hardly mentioned in earlier discussions of Michelangelo's Campidoglio. The guilds of Rome in the sixteenth century, indeed the whole world of corporate institutions and activity, were caught up in a process of dynamic expansion and change that contrasts with the stagnation of other cities; twenty-three craft guilds were founded in Rome in the sixteenth century alone.78 If Michelangelo's brief involved giving appropriate 75. See, for example, Ackerman (1986), p. 155. 76. In spite of the general scholarly consensus that the unified Campidoglio project, however and whenever it was articulated, was a matter of papal patronage, Mich?le Franceschini ("La magistratura capitalina e la tutela d?lie antichit? di Roma nel XVI Sec?lo," Archivio d?lia Societ? Romana di Storia Patria 109 [1986]: 150) has argued that the city government at very least would have welcomed the reconstruction of the front of the Senator's Palace, the ancient Tabularium, as a key element of the city's ancient architectural patrimony that the municipality was both legally bound and ideologically committed to protect. 77. On the so-called Salt War, see Ludwig von Pastor, History of the Popes from the Close of the Middle Ages (Saint Louis, 1950), 11:340; Mario Caravale and Alberto Caracciolo, Lo stato pontificio da Martino V a Pio IX (Turin, 1978), pp. 251-253. The war started in 1540 with a campaign against the rebellious subject city of Perugia; the Church's forces then turned against Ascanio Colonna and his clan, who for some time had been resisting the encroachments of papal power. By April 1541 the major Colonna fortresses had been seized and the war was effectively over. 78.

An obvious format would express subordination of the guild offices to the government spaces above. A conspicuous model was at hand in the Palazzo Caprini, which was well known to Michelangelo, who had even designed a facade based on it.79 Certainly, the patriciate that staffed the city magistracies, although interested in the orderly regulation of commercial and manufacturing activity in the markets and streets of the city, must have considered itself far superior to most of the activities and people represented by the guilds. Such attitudes seem to be expressed in the contrast of orthodox and strikingly unorthodox architectural idioms within the formal economy of the facade: on the one hand, a colossal, strictly classical Corinthian order, appropriate to a zone of governmental reason; on the other hand, the strange, somewhat squashed Ionic of the guilds' portico, enlivened by strikingly animalistic details and suggestive of the "natural" processes?including the world of everyday labor?that formed the economic base of the city (fig. 14). This corresponds to the socio architectural logic of the Caprini facade, although not, to be sure, to the latter's formal language.80 This is not the whole story, however, for many of the elite, as noted above, themselves belonged to the guild of the bovattieri, whose leading role in the social and political life of the city was asserted explicitly in the statutes of the Roman commune. None of the historians of Michelangelo's project seems to have noticed that the bovattieri had premises in the portico of the Conservatori palace at this time: the elite was active, therefore, on both levels of the palace and, by extension, the city. This complex relationship of the 79. Frommel (1973), 1:147 n. 7. 80. Arnaldo Bruschi ("Michelangelo in Campidoglio e I'invenzione dell'ordine gigante," Storia Architettura, quaderni di critica 4 [1979]: 2-28) has argued that Bramante's Roman architecture, especially the Palazzo Caprini, was crucial for Michelangelo in the formulation of the Campidoglio project. Bruschi posits a narrowly formal influence, however, insisting that the Palazzo Senatorio, with its applied order over a rusticated base, was the first building designed and from the beginning the principal element of a unified overall project. This does not accord with the documentary record, as noted above; see also my forthcoming discussion (cited in n. 27 above).

The famous giant pilasters constitute insistent vertical accents playing against contrasted horizontal zones to create a contrapuntal unity, such as is more evident in Michelangelo's later development of the same general arrangement, with clearer privileging of the verticals, for the exterior of Saint Peter's.81 Ackerman has made two fundamental observations about this. He shows that the insistence on the expression of a structural system, however fictive, denies the facade quality of Michelangelo's addition to the old palace; he argues, further, that the resulting play of dynamic tensions within the structure of the building reflects Michelangelo's radical reinterpretation of the principle of architectural organicity.82 On the basis of a celebrated critique of AI brecht D?rer's theory of proportion, Michelangelo insisted that proportions should be derived not from an ideal human body at rest but from a body in movement: its muscles and sinews in operation, subject to and arousing pathos, within an integral whole. The expression of the exertion and constraint of forces in a building therefore entails a version of the metaphor of the body, although one polemically different, to be sure, from that ingrained in the main current of Renaissance architecture. This dynamic principle is not merely a matter of aesthetics, however, in a project with the inherent political aspects of the Conservatori scheme. Indeed, one can follow the implications of Ackerman's discussion to point out elements of organic metaphoricity that eluded him. A building designed by Michelangelo, especially this building, functions not as a passive object of contemplation but as itself a subject within the physical and symbolic realms that it inhabits and, exemplifying the trope of prosopopoeia, addresses.83 But if this is true, what kind of subjectivity is in question here, who is the addressant? It surely is not simply the city government or the governing class; one must seek instead a less mundane and local subject, charged with powerful symbolic resonance. A striking feature of Michelangelo's design for the Conservatori is the absence of the statuary that clustered around the old building. Indeed, it presumably was Michelangelo's idea to move a pair of river gods from the portico of the latter to the triangular fields produced by his double stair for the Senator's Palace. Architecture became, accordingly, the primary carrier of signification, at least in the flanking palaces.84 But, as argued above, Michelangelo planned from the very beginning of the project to set statues on the balustrades, that is, at the apex of the vertical axes established by the giant pilasters. The latter, therefore, might be read as a line of overscaled, statue-carrying columnar supports of the type of the famous colossus, the statue of Apollo with Nero's features that preceded and gave its name to the Roman Colosseum.85 The most famous extant examples were the two great historiated columns of Rome, set up by Trajan and 81. Michelangelo began work at Saint Peter's after the death of Antonio da Sangallo in 1546. Ackerman (1986, p. 203) notes the decorative character of the system of articulation on the basilica, in contrast to the ostensibly structural character of that of the Palazzo dei Conservatori. Thies (1982, pp. 216ff.) presents detailed and compelling arguments for dating the Saint Peter's facade later than that of the Conservatori. The corollary is that the Conservatori facade as a whole came to serve as an architectural signifier, suggesting an interpretation of Michelangelo's conception of Saint Peter's as, among other things, civic architecture. 82. Ackerman (1986), pp. 37-52. 83. My views here echo those of Oscar B?tschmann, "Text and Image: Some Problems," Word and Image 4 (1988), esp. p. 14. It is a weakness of B?tschmann's argument that he does not mention the rhetorical trope prosopopoeia (impersonation, often involving ascription of speech to an inanimate object). For the prevalence of this in Renaissance usage, see Brian Vickers, In Defence of Rhetoric (Oxford, 1988), pp. 284, 323. 84. There perhaps was an alternative project. In the postscript to his republication of an essay on the Campidoglio, James S. Ackerman ("The Capitoline Hill," in Distance Points: Essays in Theory and Renaissance Art and Architecture [Cambridge, Mass., 1991], p. 415) notes the discrepancy between Vasari's description of the Conservatori Palace in the second edition of the Vite (1568) and the executed version (begun 1564; cf. Dup?rac's engravings of 1568 and 1569). Was the resurrection of the Campidoglio project accompanied by renewed debates about the design (cf. the probability of debate about the location of the balustrade statue of Hercules)? Remarkably, Vasari's reference to rich sculptural ornament, niches, and so on accords fully with the main features of the portico of the Palazzo Massimo aile Colonne, which served for formal and ideological reasons as an important model for the Conservatori Palace, although the porticoes of the two buildings had radically different functions and character. But in 1568 the elite bovattieri guild doubtless was already considering the abandonment, carried out in the following year, of the guild office in the Conservatori portico, where it adjoined offices of other, humbler guilds (see n. 91 below). This implies a concern with hierarchy that may well have provoked the revival of an early scheme, although Cavalieri and others perhaps saw to the retention of Michelangelo's developed project. Additionally, Vasari's own concerns as ducal architect in Florence (he began working on the Uffizi in the 1560s) may have led him to champion a more homogeneous, indeed absolutist, scheme for the municipal palace of Rome! 85.

Early-sixteenth-century elite culture was saturated with emblems, devices of self-definition and assertion comprising an often enigmatic image and text that together carried a complex but powerful message; they were often compared to or called hieroglyphs. One of the most famous emblems of the time, that of Emperor Charles V, doubtless had been displayed prominently during the latter's entry into Rome in 1536. It cited the two columns of Rome but merged them with the legendary pillars of Hercules, columns set up by the hero to mark the opening of the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic and, in sixteenth-century terms, to Charles's transatlantic domains.86 Hercules was, among other things, a founder of cities and buildings; Pythagoras, indeed, calculated Hercules's height from the length of his foot used as module in the stadium of Olympia, which, according to tradition, he laid out and which was considerably larger than the standard Greek stadium.87 And in Vitruvius's famous story, the seductive architect Dinocrates caught the attention of Alexander the Great by appearing before him nude but carrying the attributes of Hercules, the club and lion skin, in evident allusion to the scale and ambitiousness of the project he presented to Alexander?the transformation of Mount Athos into a colossal figure of a man holding a city in the palm of his hand.88 Hercules was one of the most prominent column figures of the Capitoline palaces, according to the engravings of the 1560s. He was among four divine figures crowning the single-bay side facades (the second bay was added much later) that addressed the city and framed the opening of the piazza, as shown in the engravings of 1568 and 1569.89 Two of these statues were of male gods: Jupiter, tutelary deity of the hill and father of Hercules; and Mars, ancestor of the Roman people. The third statue was of a female deity, who by 1568 had been identified with Bellona, goddess of war. None had the particular ideological significance of Hercules, as noted above, to the Roman patriciate, not least to Pietro Massimi, probably regarded as the architectural expert on the 1537 commission. The presence of Hercules therefore cues a particular iconological resonance of the muscular play of contrasted elements, noted by Ackerman, and the colossal proportions of the pilasters. The latter are themselves Herculean, emblematic of a new sense of scale in the ordering of architectural and social space.90 In Vitruvian terms, of course, the pilaster order is neither Herculean nor even Jovian, for it is Corinthian, not Doric. Michelangelo was notorious, however, for developing his own figurai language within the economy of a particular work rather than through established systems of signs: in this case, furthermore, scale itself has sign value. The Hercules of Roman legend is both divine and mortal, a founder of cities and a bovattiere, universal overscaled statue alone or situated atop a large single column, as was the case at least of the Neronian colossus. I refer later in the discussion to Vitruvius's famous account of Dinocrates's colossus project (cited in n. 88 below). 86. See, for example, Arthur Henkel and Albrecht Sch?ne, ed., Emblemata. Handbuch zur Sinnbildkunst des XVI und XVII Jahrhunderts (Stuttgart, 1967), 1: ca. 1198; Frances A. Yates, Astraea (London, 1975), pp. Iff. I am grateful to Joseph Rykwert for this reference. An early discussion appears in Paolo G ?ovio, Dialogo dell' Imprese militari et amorose (Lyons, 1555), p. 16. Giovio, whose book was also published in Rome in 1555, was a prominent figure in intellectual and courtly circles in Rome in the early sixteenth century. 87. Aulus Gellius, Nodes Atticae, 1.1. Gellius cites a lost work of Plutarch on Hercules; Plutarch, in turn, had introduced the story of Pythagoras's identification of the "mensura Herculani pedis" as a six hundredth part of the length of the stadium at Olympia (Greek stadia were traditionally six hundred feet long). 88. Vitruvius, De architectura, preface to book 2 (ed. Fensterbusch, pp. 74-77). For Francesco di Giorgio's interest in the story, see his representation of the projected colossus as Hercules, thus explicitly connecting Hercules to the architectural colossal (Hersey 1976, p. 93). 89. Hercules appears with Mars on the Palazzo Capitolino (the matching palace opposite the Palazzo dei Conservatori); in the earlier engraving Hercules is on Mars's left, but in the second the positions are reversed, and Hercules is on the corner overlooking the piazza. This is a more impressive and conspicuous position, especially as he now faces his father, Jupiter, patron of the hill, across the opening of the square. Michelangelo had associated Jupiter specifically with the Senator's Palace, even planning to set a statue of the god in the niche in front ofthat building (Ackerman 1986, p. 163; the source is Vasari's 1568 edition [Barocchi 1962, 1:85]); the rejection of this plan evidently displaced Jupiter to the Conservatori balustrade and perhaps occasioned a rethinking of the sculptural program in general. As noted by D'Onofrio (1973), pp. 198ff., the Dup?rac prints of the Campidoglio project of 1568 and 1569 show a statue of Minerva in the niche of the double stair; this clearly is the terminus ante quern for the change of mind, although D'Onofrio associates the Minerva figure already with Paul Ill's patronage. A statue of Minerva was placed in the niche, although not until 1582; it was soon replaced by a smaller statue also of Minerva, but interpreted by early commentators as Roma (Barocchi 1962, 4:1502 n. 621). 90. For the emblematic quality of giant columns employed in an architectural composition as potential citations, see Puppi (1980), p. 274. The idea of a specifically Herculean architectural scale occurs in ancient literature: a lost text by Plutarch is quoted by Aulus Gellius (see n. 87 above). Gellius's book was certainly known in the Renaissance, although I have hitherto located no reference to this passage in literature of the period.</page><page sequence="24">30 RES 23 SPRING 1993 and Roman. The association of such a being with the Renaissance Campidoglio and, more subtly, specifically with the facade articulation of the Palazzo dei Conservatori reinforces the transcendence of the dyadic ordering of that facade and of the dichotomies?base and superstructure or art/culture and nature?suggested by it. The Conservatori palace was a city hall, however, not an intellectual exercise. Michelangelo crafted a building balancing the accessibility of the portico, with its local and even popular resonances, with a framing and articulating orthodox order, perhaps an emblem of the claims to rationality of the early modern state. The contrasts explored by Michelangelo are those of any society that seeks to balance popular access and stable and predictable administrative and legal structures. If so, in the case of the Conservatori, much of the point was soon lost: in 1569 the bovattieri gave up their space in the Conservatori to the perfumers' guild,91 a symptom of the growing bureaucratization of municipal affairs, the retreat of old communal institutions, and the rise of luxury trades catering to courtly tastes and pockets. Before the end of the sixteenth century, the central window of the Conservatori palace was enlarged in the spirit of univocal symmetry and axiality, consistent with subordination to an absolutist agenda.92 This fundamental alteration of Michelangelo's design obscured its genesis in the intense situation of the late 1530s. For Michelangelo's expression of an active muscularity, a play of sinews, expresses or rather participates in the complex play of forces and loyalties within the city. The body in and of the building is not, like the captives who support or adorn buildings in the various versions of the Vitruvian story, an emblem of subjection. Rather, it alludes to a social dialectic and the difficult and continually evolving role within it of a political class challenged but not yet overwhelmed by the administratively centralizing, politically authoritarian, and fiscally exploitative tendencies of papal rule. 91.
