<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cowherd and the Saint: The Gratefiil Lion in Icelandic Folklore and Legend Marianne E. Kalinke University of Illinois LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY ICELANDIC manuscript, IB 774 8vo, contains a curious post-Reformation narrative that E. Ol. .Sveinsson characterized as a folk tale.1 The work in question is Vijjfkens saga ktiahirdis (The Saga of Vigkaenn the Cowherd).2 In discuss- ing Icelandic folk tales in his Verzeichnis islandischer Marchenvarianteny Einar Ol. Sveinsson had noted that even as late as the nineteenth century Icelandic literature was affected more by the contents of manuscripts than printed books; that Icelanders tended to preserve literary texts through oral transmission; and that these narratives thus took on the character of folk tales, that is, Volksmarchen} This seems also to have been the case with respect to the origin of Vigkens saga. In her magisterial study Romance in Iceland, Margaret Schlauch pointed out that the saga contains inter alia the motif of the unwelcome wooer, which is com- monly found in romance.4 She drew Vigkens saga into her discussion of the impact of Parcevals saga, the Old Norse-Icelandic translation of Chretien de Troyes's Perceval, on subsequent Icelandic literature and characterized the folk tale of the cowherd-turned-king as "constructed 1 Einar (Jl.

It makes use of the Three Days' Tournament by which Vi'gkaenn, a cowherd, wins a princess" (165, n. 35). Schlauch also remarked that Vigk&amp;nssaga is one of several Icelandic narratives containing the motif of the grateful lion (B360) that was popularized in another of Chretien's romances, hisYvain, translated in thirteenth-century Norway but preserved only in Icelandic manu- scripts, namely Ivenssaga.5 Like several other heroes of Icelandic romance, Vigkaenn is befriended by a lion, and Schlauch thinks that this may be due to the influence of Tram, or the general idea fostered by bestiaries that the lion is a noble animal and therefore worthy of consorting with a noble hero. In fact, both French romance and bestiary probably make the idea popular. (167) In King Arthur, North-by-Northwest, I pursued both the Icelandic variant of the motif of the grateful lion in indigenous romances and Schlauch's suggestion that this might derive from both romance and learned texts.6 Richard L. Harris, who had earlier surveyed some of the same sagas in an effort to interpret the famous wood carving on the ValJ&gt;jofsstadir door, remarked that u[t]he story of the grateful lion apparently reached medi- eval Iceland only in its chivalric form, the lion-knight legend."7 In the first half of the sixteenth century, however, a period that is arguably still part of the Icelandic Middle Ages, a variant of the grateful-lion motif older than that found in the Arthurian romance and its imitators was transmitted to Iceland. The variant, which ultimately derives from the story of Androdes and the lion, occurs in an Icelandic translation of the legend of St. Jerome. The legend is transmitted in the so-called Keykjaholabok (Sth. perg. 3, fol.) and may have been instrumental in 5 Cf.

Vigkznssaga ktiahirdis is one seven Icelandic narratives containing an analogue to the grateful-lion episode in Ivens saga} In the Arthurian romance the essential components are as follows: 1) Iven witnesses a violent struggle between a serpent and a lion; 2) he aids the lion, who appears to be appealing to him for help; 3) after the serpent has been slain, the lion demonstrates his friendliness and gratitude; 4) the lion henceforth accompanies Iven and assists him in his chivalric pursuits. The animal repays Iven's kindness by preventing the knight's accidental death when, in an attack of madness, he falls on his sword, and by aiding him in a series of encounters with a giant, three evil knights, and two giant-like men. Variations of this episode in Ivens saga, combined with related loans from Pidreks saga, were incorporated into later Icelandic fiction, but Vigk&amp;nssaga is the only post- Reformation tale containing the motif of the grateful lion. The motif in Vigkens saga differs, however, from that in the other Icelandic narratives in several respects: the grateful beast is a lioness with a mate; the cowherd helps the lioness not in a struggle with a serpent but rather in the act of giving birth; the grateful lioness and her mate do not assist Vigksenn in deeds of chivalry but carry out practical tasks assigned to them. The Icelandic folk tale illustrates the utilization, adaptation, and amalgamation of matter from diverse sources in the deployment of a motif that had wide currency in the Middle Ages. Einar Ol. Sveinsson remarked on the idiosyncrasies of Icelandic narrative transmission, and noted that there exist . . . verschiedenc Moglichkeitcn, die Stoffe zu vermengen und zu bearbeiten.

(XII-XIII) The realization of the grateful-lion motif in Vigkenssaga kuahirdis exem- plifies this phenomenon. The encounter with the lions occurs in the woods in Vtgkxnssaga. The eponymous protagonist has been riding all night looking for the dwell- ing of the evil Raudur and his brothers, who had been stealing one of the king's cows and abducting the cowherd every New Year's Night.

When Vigkaenn reaches a clearing he dismounts and walks toward an oak under which a lion and a lioness are resting. At his approach, the lion immediately scrambles to his feet and moves some distance away. The other animal, however, crawls up to Vigkarnn. He realizes that it is a lioness in labor. Vigkaenn assists her and the animal gives birth to a still-born cub.9 The grateful lioness affectionately jumps up at him, while tears run down her muzzle ("Fladrar nu dyrid upp um hann mjog vingjarnlegt, og hrundu tarin ofan eptir trininu a J&gt;vf' [20]). The lion now joins the scene and also displays his affection (ccer hyrlegt mjog") . Vigksenn invites the animals to follow him, an invitation the pair accepts, since - as the narrator remarks - lions understand human speech (20) . Vigkaenn then asks his new companions whether they know where Raudur and his brothers lived, and the two animals lead Vigkacnn to the place in question (21). Motifs from both romance and learned literature fuse in the lion episode of Vigkrns saga. A lioness who gives birth to a stillborn cub but nonetheless expresses her gratitude to Vigksenn would have puzzled an audience not familiar with medieval learned lore about lions. The four- teenth-century romznccSigurdarsagapqgla transmits the text that permits one to put the lion episode in Vigkens saga into proper perspective. In Sigurbar saga pogla the lioness is said to give birth to dead cubs, og suo liggiapeir lijflausir . iij. da/ja og . iij. tutur. og sijdan kemur til kalldyrit 00 bUs at hvelpvnutnpar tilpeir lifima. qg tnerkir hannjpessugud sialfan cr sinn son Reisti afdauda en prijdia degi eptirpijning sijna. ( 145 : 1 3-1 7) 10 (And so they lie lifeless for three days and three nights. Then the lion comes and breathes life into the cubs. And this signifies God Himself, who raised His Son from the dead on the third day after his Passion.) The above matter ultimately derives from learned literature, notably the medieval bestiaries (cf. King Arthur, 235-36), as does the reference in Vigk&amp;nssaga to the ability of lions to understand human speech. 9 "Skodar hann nu dyrid vandlega, og finnur ad |&gt;ad er med hunsott og getur ckki faett. Lcitast hann nu vid ad hja*lpa '&gt;vi, og audnast {&gt;ad. Var hunninn '&gt;i daudur" (20) [He looks at the animal carefully and realizes that it is in labor and can't give birth.

Furthermore, when the lioness and her partner agree to accompany Vigksenn, he assigns them tasks ordi- narily associated with dogs. The animals are told to watch the horses for Vigkaenn and to protect the property of the hero's father (21, 26). The partly anthropomorphic, partly canine behavior of these two lions is not original. As early as Chretien de Troyes's twelfth-century romance Train the lion looks at its rescuer with tears streaming down his face (ccsa face moilloit / de lermes").11 In the Old Norse-Icelandic translation of the French romance, Ivens saga, the rescued lion imitates a pet by rolling onto his back - as though inviting the hero to scratch his stomach - and he too expresses his gratitude and peaceful intent by means of tears: "enn leo snyr jiegar vpp aa ser maganum ok skreid ath honum sem hann vildi bidia ser fridar [ok uaetti sitt tryne] med tarum" (102:l-2;13) [but the lion rolls over on his back and crawled toward him as though he wanted to be reconciled and wet his muzzle with his tears].12 In Stgurbar saga pogla a similarly rescued lion looks up at Sigurdr with an "affectionate" look in his eyes ("dyrit leit til hans hyrligum augum),13 and when the animal approaches him, the hero pats the beast as he might a dog. During the night, the lion sleeps in front of Sigurflr's tent and subsequently is put to work as a draught animal, pulling loads of gold out of the dragon's lair (LMIR, 11:147; Ss{&gt;, 9-10). The lions in Vigkens saga kuahirdis have undergone a further develop- ment. Unlike the lions of romance, their primary function is not as the hero's companions and assistants in combat, but rather as dependable creatures assigned specific tasks while Vigkacnn is otherwise engaged. When, after the rescue of the lioness, Vigkaenn rides to the king's castle, the lions accompany him. Having dismounted outside the castle, he orders them to stay behind and guard his horse (21).

The protago- nist is finally betrothed to the princess, and when he subsequently leaves his paternal home for the wedding in the palace, he orders the two lions to stay behind and protect his father's farm until his return (25-26) . With this, the lions drop out of the tale. Vigkaenn marries the princess and accedes to the throne. The narrator brings the tale to an end by remarking that Vi'gkaenn died at an advanced age and his two sons inherited the kingdom. The lion episode and the following scenes in Vijjfkens saga might be considered a not unexpected development of the episode from Ivcnssaga^ a development already evident in Sigurdarsagapogla. In the folk tale the courtly protagonist of romance is replaced by a farmer's son who wins a princess and a kingdom by virtue of his prowess. Given the bucolic setting and non-aristocratic characters, the metamorphosis of the lion as companion-in-combat, a role he plays in romance, into exotic watch dog seems quite plausible. The characterization of the lions in Vigkenssaga - the lioness, whose young are stillborn, and who is able to understand human speech, as old books tell ("segja fornar bsekur" [20]) - is ulti- mately inspired, to judge by the nature of the text, by learned literature, such as thcPhysiologus.1* The author ofVigkzns saga may have also been acquainted, no matter how indirectly, with a lion other than the one made popular by the romances and bestiaries, namely the lion of hagiography, a lion ultimately also deriving from folklore and the precur- sor of the grateful lion of courtly romance. According to Einar Ol. Sveinsson, Vigkxns saga, ktiahirdis originated after the Reformation (LVII) and the tale is preserved in a single manu- script written in the nineteenth century. With the execution of Bishop Jon Arason of Holar in 1550, the Catholic era came to an end in Iceland. Some ten to twenty years before this crucial turning point, the monu- mental legendary, Stockholm perg. 3 fol., had been produced.15 The 14 Another Icelandic lion whose origin similarly is to be sought in learned literature is the lion in Hrolfssaga Gautrekssonar, a lion that can be cowed into submission when subjected to the grunts of pigs. This portrait of the lion presumably arose from learned lore concerning the elephant's fear of pigs.

Reykjaholabok^ so named after Bjorn's home, contains twenty-five legends, several cop- ied from older Icelandic translations from the Latin, but most translated from Low German. Bjorn was not only the copyist of the legends previously translated and the scribe of the entire collection, but one can also reasonably presume that he himself compiled the legendary and translated the Low German legends.16 Although earlier scholarship main- tained that the translated legends derive from one of the many imprints of the Low German Passionael, a popular and widely circulating legend- ary, published eight times between 1478 and 15 17,17 it can be demonstrated that Bjorn's sources were different, longer redactions than those found in the Passionael.18 Several texts in the legendary belong more properly to the realm of fiction than hagiography. The most blatant example is Gregvrius saga biskups, a tale of double incest, which derives ultimately from Hartmann von Aue's legendary romance Gregorius.19 Other texts similarly are more at home in fiction than hagiography, such as the legends of King Oswald20 and of the Seven Sleepers. Still others, while dealing with historical saints, nevertheless transmit fanciful folk tales, for example, the legend of St. John Chrysostom (t407), more than half of which is a tale of 16 The legendary was edited by Agnete Loth, Reykjaholabok: Islandske helgenlegender, I- II, Editiones Arnamagnaeana; A, 15-16 (Copenhagen:Munksgaard, 1969-70). In the intro- ductory matter, Loth presents the evidence for positing Bjorn as the translator of the Low German texts. In her edition ofTlie History of the Cross-Tree, Mariane Overgaard was the first to identify Bjorn as the scribe of the Icelandic legendary and translator of the Low German legends.

Presumably because the text concludes with an invocation of St. John Chrysostom, the tale eventually came to be designated the "Istoria di San Giovanni Boccadoro"21 and the Eastern Doctor and Father of the Church assumed the role of the miscreant. The legend of interest to us in the context of Vigkxns saga ktiahirdis is devoted to St. John Chrysostom's contemporary, another Doctor and Father of the Church, namely St. Jerome (t420). The legend in Reykjaholabok (II: 211-53) consists of three distinct narrative types: biography (chs. 1-4; 8-9); folk tale (chs. 5-7); and miracle tale (chs. 10-33). Chapters 5-7 of the legend of St. Jerome transmit a variant of the folk tale of Androcles and the lion.22 The ancient tale had currency in the Middle Ages primarily through its presence in the Gesta Romanorumy where it appears under the heading "De beneficiorum memoria."23 Ac- cording to this account, a knight chances upon a suffering lion one day and frees the animal from pain by removing a thorn in its paw. Subse- quently the grateful lion refuses to devour the knight when the latter, having become an outlaw, is captured and thrown before the beast. Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur argued convincingly that the grateful lion in the Arthurian romance Tvain^ who "helps the hero only because the hero has first helped it," ultimately derives from the tale of Androcles.24 A variant of the same tale entered the realm of hagiography and became attached to the legend of St. Jerome. In the so-called Legenda aurea^ produced by the Dominican friar Jacob of Voragine sometime in the period 1262-66, the tale goes as follows:25 21 Dietz-Riidigcr Moscr, Die Tannbauser-Legende: Eine Studie fiber Intentionalitat und Rezeption katechetischer Volkserzablungen zwn BujZ-Sakratnent (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1977), 84.

When the monks saw the animal they fled, but Jerome welcomed the lion, which showed him his wounded foot. The monks were called together to wash the lion's foot and discovered that the wound had been caused by a thorn. They nursed the lion back to health, and the lion lived among them as a domestic animal. St. Jerome realized that the lion came to them not only because he was in need of their assistance but also because God wanted to help the monks, and therefore on the advice of the monks the lion was charged with guarding the donkey that carried firewood for the monastery. One day, however, while the lion is asleep, some merchants steal the donkey. When the lion wakes up and fails to locate the animal he was to guard, he returns sadly to the monastery, but doesn't dare enter because he is ashamed. The monks suspect the lion of having devoured their donkey, because he came home later than was normally the case, but fail to find evidence that such is the case. St. Jerome suggests that they have the lion carry out the tasks formerly assigned to the donkey. One day the lion chances upon some merchants whose camels are being led by the monastery's donkey. The faithful animal frightens the merchants off and drives the animals to the monas- tery. St. Jerome realizes at once what has happened. When the merchants subsequently appear at the monastery, they ask for pardon and promise to supply the monastery henceforth with oil. Redactions of the Latin tale in the Legenda aurea quickly appeared in vernacular legendaries. In the German-language realm the tale of St. Jerome and the lion - or reminiscences of it - was incorporated into such collections as the so-called Vers-Passional26 the Vaterbuch (w. 27181 ff.),27 the Elsassiscbe Legenda aurea,28 and Hermann von Fritzlar's Heiligenleben.29 The tale is also included in Dergrofie Seelentrost, a four- teenth-century catechetical text on the Ten Commandments containing a large anthology of exempla.30 Not only a relatively high number of 26 Fr.

Through Bjorn Eorleifsson's translation of Low German legends in Reykjaholabok^ the sacred folktale also became known in Iceland. Bjorn's compilation is a legendary, containing matter associated with the life and afterlife of both actual and apocryphal saints. Given both the late date of composition, on the very eve of the Reformation, and a lack of the edifying and instructive tone that is associated with older legendaries, such as the Legenda aurea and the Passionael, Reykjaholabok could not have had an impact on Icelandic religious life. Some of the tales, how- ever, are characterized by tension, drama, and unforgettable characters and therefore some of the matter found in the legendary might have entered folklore. Although Reykjaholabok is preserved solely in Bjorn I&gt;orleifsson's autograph (Sth. perg. 3 fol.) - which is not surprising, considering that the legendary was produced at the end of the Catholic period - the manuscript nonetheless was read and read critically at that. At the head of the legend of St. Gregory the Great (fol. 33v, b), for example, a later hand has noted: "Eesse saga er lesandi en ecki aullu truandi" (Rhb, LXLI) [This account can be read but is not to be believed], while just before the end of the same legend (fol. 383, b) appears the comment: "j^etta er mikel / lygabok" (Rhb LXLI) [this is a big book of lies]. At the end of the legend of St. Sebastian (fol.87r) someone has remarked: "f&gt;etta eru onytsamleg[ar] baekur fafrodum ad lesa J&gt;vi j^eir finnast marger sem ecki eru djupsetter i Gudz ordi og fremur trua fabulvm og draumum 000 og morgum jllum [&gt;anka enn Heilagri Bibliu" (Rhb LXLI) [these are useless books that the ignorant can read, for there are many who are not deeply grounded in God's Word who would rather believe in fables and dreams 000 and many evil ideas than the Holy Bible]. Despite the derogatory remarks concerning the histo- ricity and credibility of the legends, expressive of a post-Reformation mentality, these as well as other marginal annotations in Reykjaholabok attest that the volume's contents indeed were known. 31 Der Heiligen Leben is extant in 197 manuscripts, 33 High German and 8 Low German imprints. The legendary was published in the period 1471-72 (Augsburg) - 1521 (Straflburg). Cf. Werner WiUiams-Krapp^Die deutschen und niederldndiscben Lejendare des Mittelalters, 188-238.</page><page sequence="11">The Cowherd and the Saint 11 There are reasons why Icelanders, even if averse to the religious literature of the Catholic period, might have read some of the narratives in Reykjaholabok. One of the notable characteristics of most of the trans- lated legends is their injection of extensive dialogue, occasionally also monologue - to replicate thought or prayer - and the introduction of motivation for the actions of the characters. Although the narrator plays an important role in these texts, especially in revealing motivation for behavior, the characters are also allowed to speak for themselves. They are three-dimensional figures and their behavior covers a broad range. While it can be edifying (St. Kunegund), it is also amusing (the devil in the legend of St. Christopher); it can startle the reader (St. John Chrysostom's murder of a woman he has seduced) or provoke chuckles (the encounter of the princess and St. George). One sympathizes with the dilemma of saints caught between celibacy and the need for a wife (Emperor Henry II and King Oswald) and is charmed by posthumous demonstrations of friendship (Sts. Lawrence and Stephen). The dis- course in the Icelandic legendary is remarkably different from that in the predominantly third-person narrative of the Low GcrmznPassionael and its High German ancestor Der Heiligen Lcben. According to Siegfried Ringler, the basis for the formation of a legend is extraliterary: it is faith, not an individual faith but that of the community with its established notions and traditions.32 The sacred legend therefore does not attempt to convey what is novel, nor is there tension produced by uncertainty. In general, the narrative proceeds in a fashion that might be characterized as a simple, calm account ("einfacher, ruhiger Bericht" [265]). Ringler's observations aptly characterize the essence of the legends in the Passionael; the same does not obtain, however, with respect to the texts of Reykjaholabok. Comparison of the tale of St. Jerome and the lion with its counterpart in the Passionael reveals a remarkable divergence in dis- course, which consequently also implies a difference in the function of the two versions. The hagiographic folk tale of St. Jerome and the grateful lion consists of four parts: the lion's appearance at the monastery and its healing; the theft of one of the donkeys the lion is supposed to watch; the return of the donkey by die lion; and the encounter between the merchants and 32 aZur Gattung Lcgcnde: Versuch einer Strukturbestimmung der christlichen Hciligenlegendc des Mittclaltcrs"Wurzbur£iei'PtvsastudienII: Untersuchutigen zurLiteratur undSprachedesMittelalters, cd.

(CC.ix, c-d)33 (Once upon a time there came a lion; he walked on three legs, and the fourth hurt him. He went to the door of the monastery. The brothers became very afraid and fled. Then St. Jerome received the lion quite kindly. Then the lion stretched out the sore foot to him. St. Jerome looked at it and washed the foot until it was well again. Then he saw a thorn in it, and he took it out, and wound a bandage around it, and healed his foot. The lion then became as tame as a little dog and didn't want to leave. Then St. Jerome said: "God has sent us the lion not only so that we can heal his foot - He could have healded it himself - but He has sent him to give us assistance. Therefore assign him a task." Then the brothers said: "He should watch our donkey, and lead it out to pasture and back home." The lion then received his assignment and guarded the donkey, and never left it, but led it out and brought it back at the right time.) The incident, as reported in the Passionael is narratively uninteresting. With the exception of the brief verbal exchange between St. Jerome and the monks, the plot is presented as a third-person report. St. Jerome is a shadowy figure - although the narrator transmits a positive impression by characterizing the saint's reception of the lion as kind - and so are the monks. By revealing, however, that they run away, the narrator contrasts them with the saint and thus implicitly brands them as cowards. The 33 The text is taken from the 1492 imprint of Dat Passionael^ which was published in Liibeck.

The simile provides the explanation for the lion's unwillingness to leave the monastery after he has been healed. The paratactic style of the entire episode, only exaggerated by the recurrent do, conveys the simplest sequential pattern. The uncomplicated syntax, in combination with an account of only outwardly observable actions, produces a vignette devoid of tension, despite the flight of the monks. This form of narrative, which obtains throughout the Low German tale of the lion - indeed, is a feature of all the legends in thcPassionael - lacks vivid characterization and dramatic interaction. inReykjaholabok this episode, as well as the ensuing plot, is presented in a rather different way. The author, that is, the person who composed the Low German version translated by B jorn Eorleifsson, created a tale in which every figure gets his due, including the anthropomorphic lion. Once the lion has regained the use of his fourth leg, he becomes an actor who is on an equal but implicitly adversarial footing with the monks in respect to the monastery's endeavors. The discourse in the Icelandic tale differs radically from that evident throughout the Low German text. The narrator yields the floor time and again to permit the characters to express themselves both in words and action. The Icelandic version is longer by virtue of extended dialogue, additional scenes, and the inclu- sion of motivation for the behavior of the principals. Moreover, the narrator's role diverges from that of the fairly neutral observer in the Passionael who does not reveal what motivates the players. The implied author of the Icelandic version is a partial mediator who understands the story of the lost and regained donkey as the drama of the unwelcome and therefore mistrusted outsider in an intolerant community willing to believe the worst. The tale commences when the lion leaves the woods one day and arrives at the monastery. Although the information is presented as se- quential, the syntax suggests purpose, that the lion knew exactly what he was doing: he "gieck . . . vr morckinne og at klavstvrs dyrvnvm" (II, 216: 16-17) [he walked out of the woods and to the door of the monas- tery] . The reason, we are informed, the lion walks on three feet is that he felt great pain in his fourth leg and therefore could not endure putting the foot down. As in thcPassionael, the monks are afraid and flee, but we are additionally informed that they hid themselves. The fear suggested here thus exceeds that expressed in the Low German redaction. The lion's various motions vis-a-vis St. Jerome are depicted as might be the actions</page><page sequence="14">14 Scandinavian Studies of a mute. When the saint welcomes the lion, the animal understood this ("J&gt;etta skilde dyrit" [II, 216:21-22]). He lay in front of Jerome and stretched out his sore paw "as though he were asking for help" (II, 216:23-24 "jafntt og '&gt;at villde beidazt hialppar"). The narrator com- ments that "God's friend" understood what the animal had in mind. Unlike the scene in the Passionael, Jerome's ministrations to the animal have at least an implicit audience, for the saint asks that clean water be brought to him. This practical consideration also exists in older German versions of the legend as does the introduction of other partici- pants. In the Legenda aurea, St. Jerome orders the monks to wash the lion's paw and to search for a wound (655), actions also transmitted in the Vaterbuch (27205-8). In the Vers-Passional, the activity is depersonalized through the use of the third-person pronoun man (510:8, 10), and while the redactor of thcElsassische Legenda aurea has the monks bring water, Jerome himself washes the wound (658). In the Icelandic tale, the saint not only washes the wound, but then he massages the paw until it is better - presumably he thereby dislodges the thorn. The treat- ment concludes with Jerome calling for a bandage, for the sake of cleanliness, so that the wound would not become infected ("efter j^at J)vxr hann fothen allann aa dyrenv og Jjnarmar vmm med hondvm sinvm J&gt;angat thil at f&gt;vi var allbaett. en saker ohreinenda lieth hann binnda einn dvk vmm so ecki skyllde spillazt saret" [II, 216:27-30]). Needless to say, the beast is grateful and becomes as tame, the narrator remarks, as though it had lived among dogs for a long time. In the Icelandic version the lion has undergone a profound anthropomorphosis; the narrator not merely depicts the animal's behavior but also seeks to convey the underlying motivation. The lion wants to become integrated into the community - the narrator remarks that he did not ever want to leave, and Jerome understands this - but the monks are less favorably inclined; in fact, they could very well get along without him ("en mvnckvm var minna vmm j^at og mattv vel sia af honvm" [216:32-34]). This too is the narrator's observation, and he notes that St. Jerome realized that his fellow monks cared little for the beast. The saint consequently becomes the mediator between the unusual guest and the antagonistic monks. St. Jerome reminds them that God could have healed the animal, had He been so inclined, but that He has sent the lion to be of service to the monastery. In what must be considered a diplomatic move, given his realization of the monks' dislike of the lion, St. Jerome has them decide how the lion might be put to work. They mention his strength and speed</page><page sequence="15">The Cowherd and the Saint 15 and suggest that he guard their donkeys; he is to drive them out to the meadow each day and then bring them back. In their response the monks clearly intend to assert their power over the beast. The lion's work is to be performed "when w want this" and iCwhenhe is ordered to do so" ("er V£r vilivm"; "er honvm er |pat skipaf* [II, 217:5-6]), and the chapter concludes with the observation that the lion drove the donkeys out to pasture and back home "each time he was told to do so." What distinguishes the entire narrative inReykjaholabok, aside from its greater length, from the redaction in the Passionael, is the inclusion of vocabulary denoting the emotional and intellectual realms. The lion is unable to endure (polde . . . ecki) stepping on his hurt foot, and he "understands" (skilde) St. Jerome's benevolence, while the saint "under- stands" or realizes (under stod) what the animal wanted and subsequently becomes aware of (fieck. . . at skilia) the monks' aversion to the animal. The lion did not ever want (villde alldre) to leave the monastery, but the monks cared little (mvnckvm var minna) for this idea and could do without him (mattp vel sica af honvm). When St. Jerome accepts the monks' suggestion regarding the task to be assigned to the lion, the latter understands the nature of the task he is being given (skilde pat sent pvi var skipat) and accepts the assignment readily (oggiorde patafollvm lettha). None of the German versions either depicts the lion in such a human manner or establishes the aversion of the monks to the lion, which is only to increase in the course of the narrative. The monks' awareness of their superiority and their antagonism to- ward the beast implicitly determine the lion's subsequent behavior. The anthropomorphic qualities the animal displayed upon arriving at the monastery become more pronounced. After the lion has been assigned the task of guarding the monastery's donkeys - it should be noted that in the Passionael as well as the older Vaterbuch^ Vers-Passional^ and Legenda aurea the lion has to watch only one donkey - he accepts his charge quite readily (afollvm lettha [II, 217:8]); presumably he is relieved that he may stay in the monastery. The nature of die scene suggests that the lion is listening to the discussion, wondering what his fate is to be. Therefore, once he has learned their decision, "he took good care of the donkeys, driving them home each time he was told to do so and likewise out again to pasture" (II, 217:8-9). The relationship established between the monks and the lion is understood as a contract: the lion is fed in return for bringing the donkeys safely back to the monastery each evening.</page><page sequence="16">16 Scandinavian Studies The initial antagonistic relationship between the lion and the monks resurfaces when the animal literally sleeps on the job. Once more, St. Jerome has to intervene. The Icelandic narrative contains one more scene in this episode than the Passionael and differences in narrative detail, which not only contribute to creating a more vivid narrative but also to arousing the reader's sympathies for the lion. More than in the first episode, the language of the emotions comes to the fore. One day, while the animals are grazing in the woods, the lion falls asleep. Some passing merchants realize that the donkeys are unguarded and abduct one of them. Upon awakening and discovering the loss of one of the donkeys, the lion behaves like a madman. He lamented (barmade hann sier) the loss and ran every which way; when he could not find the donkey, he returned in an extremely dejected state (hardla hrygghr) to the monas- tery. The monks think he has killed the donkey and tell him to go back to the fields and finish consuming the carcass. Despite their groundless accusations, the lion exhibits humility. The narrator remarks that the noblest and fiercest of animals demonstrated his obedience and great gentleness (hlydne ogstora avdmivkth) ; he left the monastery in a dejected rather than an angry state (med hryggv thil lithe en eige grimmv) in order to look for the donkey once more. Although the narrator chooses not to comment on the behavior of the monks, the implicitly positive assess- ment of the lion's reaction suggests that the narrator not only aligns himself with the lion but that he thereby also influences the reader to do so. The references to the lion's virtues in face of persecution suggest that the narrator and the implied audience have a shared system of values. The behavior of the lion stands in contrast to that of the monks. They berate the lion (tholvdvjlla vid hann) and refuse to give him food. The mention of the lion's humility in face of the abuse heaped on him by the monks does not occur in the Low German version or in any of the High German redactions. Nor does the Passionael version convey the impres- sion that the lion is sent to sleep without his supper, which is the case in the Icelandic tale, for the lion undertakes a second search for the donkey after the monks have scolded him. He leaves the monastery with a downcast - yet not fierce - countenance {med hryggv thil lithe en eige grimmv)^ and the narrator remarks that his search for the donkey went just as the day before. No matter where he looked, he could not find the donkey. When he returns to the monastery, the scene from the previous evening is repeated, and the monks harp at him with vile words (harppa</page><page sequence="17">The Cowherd and the Saint 17 ad honvmjllvtn ordvm II, 217:31). Once more the lion does not fight back; instead, he slinks away abashed but peaceably wagging his tail. The episode concerning the lion and the monks is a curious fusion of fictional and didactic matter. While the original exemplary intent is conveyed through the opposition established between the lion's superi- ority and ferocity among animals and his obedience and gentleness in the face of reprimands, the narrator does not capitalize on the lesson to be learned: long suffering and humility in adversity. Because the didactic element is only implicit, the effect of the story on the reader is not edification - the original purpose of the folk tale adapted as sacred leg- end - but rather outrage. Though the lion may in fact be faulted for his shortcoming as herdsman, the reader sympathizes with the animal be- cause of the unkindness, in fact, gratuitous nastiness displayed by the monks. The dramatic irony of the situation - i.e., the knowledge of what had actually happened - forces the audience to assume the adversarial position vis-a-vis the monks that the lion has chosen not to take. Of course there is a lesson to be drawn, but the narrator chooses not to comment. The episode not only provokes the reader's indignation but also creates suspense as to the outcome of the conflict. In effect the exemplary value of the narrative is suppressed. As happened during the first confrontation between the lion and the monks, St. Jerome intervenes once more. He orders the lion himself to carry out the task that had been the donkey's, that is, to fetch firewood for the monastery. Thus the animal returns each day with a load on his back. The episode recounting the loss of the donkey and the assumption of its work by the lion concludes with the narrators observation that the lion does not forget to keep a lookout for the donkey. In the Low German redaction, the above is related with considerable brevity: the lion returns without the donkey, the monks think he has killed it, they refuse to feed the lion, and they look for the donkey themselves but do not find it: Do de brodere sephen dat de louwe wasghekomen vndc brochtc den ezel nicht. do dachten se dat he den ezel hadde ghegheten. vnde gheuen em nicht to ethende als to vorne vnde seden Gha vnde eth den ezel altomale. vnde se sochten den ezel vnde vunden den nicht. (CC.ix, d) (When the brothers saw that the lion had returned without the donkey, they thought that he had eaten the donkey and gave him nothing to eat, as they were wont to do, and said: Go and eat the rest of the donkey. And they looked for the donkey and did not find it.)</page><page sequence="18">18 Scandinavian Studies The last sentence implies that the monks expect to find the donkey's carcass; in the Legenda aurea, however, which is the ultimate source of the tale in the Passionael, the monks are not depicted as being quite that prejudiced, for the narrator remarks that even though they told the lion to eat what was left of the donkey, they were in doubt whether he had perpetrated the evil deed ("Haesitantes tamen, utrum hoc malum perpetrasset" [656] ) . Indeed, in the Vaterbuch^ the belief by some monks that the lion is not the culprit is quite pronounced. The monks report the incident to St. Jerome, and he tells them to feed the lion but to assign him henceforth the donkey's work (27328-57). In the preceding episode, the narrator of the Icelandic version has succeeded in enlisting the reader's sympathies for the lion and arousing antipathy toward his antagonists. In the subsequent episode, another change in narrative strategy takes place or, if you will, a different aspect comes to the fore as the events leading up to the reunion with the donkey are depicted entirely from the lion's perspective. In the previous episode, which concluded with the lion's agreeing to fetch firewood for the monks, the narrator had additionally noted that the lion did this every day. The chapter concluded with a sentence that hovers between autho- rial report and erlebte Rede: enpo villde hann eckigleymapvi at Icitha nockvtca hverivtn deirjhe eftcr asna sinvtn po honvtn skothnade qg lited en. (II, 218:6-8) (but he did not intend to forget to search for a while every day for his donkey, but he had little success.) The reunion episode that follows commences by particularizing the foregoing: "One time, when the lion was searching in the woods, as was his wont, he heard men speaking loudly" (II, 218:9-10). The subse- quent incidents are recounted solely from the perspective of the lion, whose behavior mimics that of a human being. He runs in the direction from which he hears the noise but then veers off the road in order to conceal himself in the woods (II, 218:10-12). Through the eyes of the lion the reader is witness to what happens. Many merchants come into view accompanied by a large group of donkeys bearing goods. Suddenly the lion recognizes the lead donkey as his donkey (asne bans). The narrator returns to report that the courageous lion now demonstrates his might and fury; he jumps at the donkeys and drives them all to the monastery. At this display of ferocity, the terrified merchants run into the woods. A comparison of the above with the Low German redaction only emphasizes the blandness of the discourse in the latter.</page><page sequence="19">The Cowherd and the Saint 19 While our primary concern is to assess the narrative art of the Icelan- dic tale, the origin of the redactions in the Passionael should be kept in mind, for they played a role in determining their character. Scholars have observed that the legends in the Passionael are drawn from a variety of sources including legendaries such as the Latin Legenda aurea and the German Vers-Passional^ as well as individual works, for example, Hartmann von Aue's Gregorius and Reinbot von Durne's Georg?* Some of the source texts were in verse, evidence of which occasionally surfaces in the prose redactions. The folk-tale section of the legend of St. Jerome derives from one of these legendaries, namely the so-called Vers-Passional (Wil- liams-Krapp, 287). The redactor ofthcHeiligenLeben/Passionael legends generally shortened the source texts, reduced dialogue, and retold the narratives mostly in the third person. The nature of the discourse in the legends derives from their function: the texts were presumably intended for use in a monastic community (Williams-Krapp, 295). If one com- pares the reunion scene in the Low German and Icelandic redactions with the text of the Legenda aurea, a modification of detail becomes evident. Jacob of Voragine reports that when the lion espied the mer- chants, they had with them camels laden with wares, and the monastery's donkey was leading them. The author comments: it was the custom in that country, if one undertook a long journey with camels, to have a donkey leading them to ensure that the camels did not veer off the path (656). This did not find its way either into the Viiterbuch or the Vers- Passional. In the Low German prose Passionael there is at first only mention that the donkey was at the head of a caravan, but subsequently we are told that the lion drives the donkey to the monastery, together with all the goods carried on the backs of the camels. The author of the Low German redaction that is the source of our Icelandic version, however, had made a change: just as the lion was in charge of herding many donkeys for the monks - not just one, as thcPassionael reports - so now the merchants' beasts of burden are not camels but rather donkeys. And the enthusiastic lion drives the whole lot back to the monastery. The reunion of the lion with his donkey is followed by the reunion of the monks with the donkey. Their reaction strongly contrasts with their earlier behavior. They now admit they have done wrong, acknowledge the injustice of their earlier accusations, and confess that the lion "has put up with us and demonstrated his innocence far more than we have 34 Werner Williams-Krapp, Die deutschen und niederlandiscben Legendare des Mittelalters, 271-92.</page><page sequence="20">20 Scandinavian Studies deserved" (cc[e]nn hann hefvr oss betvr {}olad og so boret sina oskvlld ollv framar enn vxr hofvm forj^ienat" [218:21-22]). In response, the lion demonstrates the same affectionate behavior that he had shown in adver- sity: he jumps up at them with joy and rubs against them. The realization of the grateful-lion motif in the legend of St. Jerome and in Vighzns saga kuahirUs is quite different from its expression in Arthurian romance and its imitators. As Brodeur has argued, the lion in Tvain belongs to the family of the "grateful beasts, which assist the hero out of thankfulness for a specific service which he has previously rendered them" (518; author's italics). While this is also the case in the legend of St. Jerome and the tale of Vigkaenn, the service rendered by the grateful lion in the hagiographic and folkloristic variants of the tale differs consid- erably from that in the romances. Whereas the lion becomes the protagonist's companion and assistant against enemies in Ivens saga and the sagas that borrow the grateful-lion motif, in legend and folklore the animal is charged with carrying out domestic tasks on its own. The interaction of the lions with the protagonist in Vtgkens saga kuahirUs may have been inspired by familiarity, if only rather vague, with the hagiographic variant of the tale of Androdes and the lion as it was recounted in the legend of St. Jerome in Reykjaholabok. To be sure, the appearance of a lion as help to a hero is a not uncommon motif in Icelandic narrative. Indeed, there exists another folk tale, ccSagan af raudabola," a so-called stjupusaga (ccevil-stepmother tale"), in which a lion, just as in medieval romance, assists the hero SigurSur in combating a series of giants.35 In this case the lion materializes from under a bed during one of Sigurdur's adventures, and when the hero realizes that the animal means him no harm, he pats it. From then on the animal accom- panies him. At the end of the tale it turns out that the lion actually is a princess whose evil stepmother had put a spell on her, that is, the princess-as-lion belongs in the category of Brodeur's "guiding beasts," who help the hero "in order to attain their own ends" (518). What differentiates the lion motif in the two folk tales is the function of the animal. The lion in Sagan afraudabola bears traces of the medieval lion who assists in combat, with the twist that the lion is no lion at all. In Vigkxnssaga, however, die lion has become a domestic animal willing to 35 "Sagan afraudabola," Islenzkar pjodsqgur qg wintyii: Safiiad hejurjon Arnason: Nyttsafh, augm. cd., Arni Bodvarsson and Bjarni Vilhjalmsson (Reykjavik: Bokautgafan I&gt;j66saga, Prentsmidjan Holar, 1956), lV:541-48.</page><page sequence="21">The Cowherd and the Saint 21 assume menial tasks, and it may well be that the motif recalls, however vaguely, the selfless lion whom St. Jerome had helped. The fact that both St. Jerome and Vigksenn rescue lions physically debilitated - as opposed to lions under attack by a serpent, as is the case in romance - further links the hagiographic and folkloristic realizations of the grateful-lion motif. The incorporation in Icelandic literature of reminiscences from sacred literature is not unknown.36 In the last analysis sacred legends can be polyfunctional, embracing the goals of the so-called Bildungsroman, religious didacticism, and entertainment.37 In many sacred narratives occurs a combination of motifs taken from sacred legend andMarchen (Karlinger, 44). The grateful-lion motif, which ultimately derives from secular literature, was successfully employed in various types of sacred literature, ranging from the overtly didactic to texts whose instructive intent was masked by the obviously entertaining discourse of the narra- tive. In the aforementioned Low German catechetical work Der grofie Seelentrost the tale of St. Jerome and the lion is one of eleven exempla illustrating the eighth commandment. The tale concludes on a hortatory note that reveals how a preacher might have explicated the text and applied its lessons: Kynt hue, du schalt truwc kumpan wesen, wan du bist in der pelegrimatese. Bistu vntruwe, du vorlusest al din arbeit. (237:24-25) (Dear child, be a faithful companion, for you are on a pilgrimage. If you are unfaithful, all your efforts will be for naught.) Whereas the paratactic thirty-line exemplum proceeds inexorably to the lesson to be learned, the discourse of the tale of the grateful lion in Reykjaholabok compels one to linger over the text, to be charmed by a 36 Elizabeth Ashman Rowe plausibly suggested in an article published in 1990, that the PdttrSveins ok Finns mFlateyjarbok may have been inspired by the legend of St. Christopher ("Searching for the Highest King: St. Christopher and Pdttr Sveins ok Finns? Arkiv for nordisk filolqgi, 105 [1990], 131-39). The fourteenth-century Ddmusta saga, which is basically a bridal-quest narrative, is at the same time a Marian legend, presumably inspired by the many narratives circulating in the Middle Ages about the willingness and power of Mary to help those devoted to her, no matter how heinous their crime (cf. Marianne E. Kalinke, Bridal-Quest Rotnance in Medieval Iceland, Islandica, 46 [Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1990], 123-34). 37¥c]ixK^'ingcr,Ij^etuiefifof'scbun£i:Augiabefi undErgebnisse (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1986, 37: "Legenden erweisen sich - vor allem in Ablauf der Jahrhunderte - als polyfunktional; sie umschliefien die Aufgabe des Bildungsromans, religioser Didaktik und der schlichten Unterhaltung."</page><page sequence="22">22 Scandinavian Studies thoroughly likable lion, and to hope for his vindication. The vivid characterization, dramatic encounters, and intrinsic suspense of the tale would have guaranteed its remembrance by anyone who ever read or heard it. Thus it is not surprising that the motif of the grateful lion, albeit quite transformed, was subsequently incorporated into oral narrative. While the legend of St. Jerome borrowed the motif from an ancient folk narrative, the tale of Androcles, that same motif in the post-Reformation folktale of Vigksenn presumably derives from the legend of St. Jerome.</page></plain_text>
