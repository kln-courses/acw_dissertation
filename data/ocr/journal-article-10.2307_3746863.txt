Edited, with a Memorial Introduction, by Prof. Kemp Smith. (London: Macmillan &amp; Co. 1938. Pp. Vol. I, xlviii + 423; Vol. II, xiii + 438. Price 3os. the two vols.). I believe this to be one of those rare works which at once take their due place in the front rank of British Philosophy. It is a masterly presentation of original principles that must indelibly impress the thought of to-day. And this not only so far as its main themes are concerned, but equally as regards others which, despite the detailed discussion accorded to them, are skilfully subordinated to the Philosophy of Religion itself. Logic and Epis- temology, Realism and Idealism, Science and History, Ethics and Psychology are all brought within one comprehensive viewpoint, and surveyed with a penetrative vision that never loses sight of the far-reaching forest owing to the innumerable trees. The subtlety of the argument, indeed, sometimes verges upon paradox, as in the question: "Is it possible to experience what it is to be unconscious?" But however involved the analysis may become, it is inevitably refocused upon Religion. The Ontology, in the first place, is unambiguously realistic: "to exist as an appearance is to be the function of an independent Real; every experience of an appearance is an experience of the object itself; the independent Real is a real object of experience." Needless to add that appearance in all its modes, and experience at every level, are conditioned, but always in such a way that despite the profound contrasts between the conscious self and its objects, direct and unbroken contact is sustained between them, however diversified or distorted it may be. Even if the problem of the Real and its Appearances is not finally solved, this discussion is of the highest value. The mere statement of the issues in these terms, however, may seem to assign a relative unreality to the subject; but this suggestion is categorically rejected. For while experience necessarily implies having an object, it is far more significant in that it involves being a subject. Not, of course, that these two principles can be severed; rather is it a matter of emphasis, and even of value; to be a subject has its own intrinsic character and far outweighs the implications, important though these also are, of having an object; and with this Realism is inseparably associated Permanence, in and of subject and object alike. However baffling, or even inscrutable, such Permanence may be, the arguments on its behalf are of the weightiest order; and while the contentions of current Phenomenalism, Neo-Positivism, and Psychological Atomism are clearly recognized and evaluated, they are countered by a criticism so effective as to confront their advocates with extremely formidable difficulties. The term "self" and "selfhood" are, however, employed in an unusually comprehensive, though perfectly legitimate, sense. All selves, without excep- tion, are "highly integrated, self-identical wholes," never to be fully under- stood simply in terms of their physical conditions. Thus far, then, "inanimate 93</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY nature, the actually existing world, is a system of selves," only "not of experience-bearing selves"; the first type possesses an inner, or intrinsic, character of its own which must be rigorously distinguished from all relations, while it also enjoys some degree of the permanence already insisted upon. Incidentally, this principle seems to be very slowly forcing itself upon modern scientific theory, and even, though against the author's own contention, into Physics. But however this may be, the second mode-"selfhood-experience" -involves (to repeat) "a permanent subject," an "identity of selfhood, actually experienced in the sense that every experience comes to us as an experience of the self. We feel ourselves to be the universal and uniform subject of every object and event." Thus all variants of Subjectivism are categorically rejected. The inclusive use of "self" to denote "the complex existent" as such, however, appears to me to confuse the further distinction between this "selfhood in general" on the one hand, and personality on the other. But this is after all a quite minor point; the essential principle is that "we learn to think of ourselves as inviolably self-identical in the unique concept of personality." A "person," in short, is "an experience-bearing self," and personality implies not merely "what it is to have an object," but (once more) "what it is to be a subject," while it is on the contrary "impossible to attribute modes of experience to the permanently unconscious." How, then, do these conclusions bear upon Religion? To begin with, "a personalist interpretation of nature" is one outstanding characteristic of primitive religion; but still more fundamental is the principle that "the notion of personality (is) the pivot on which everything turns," since it constitutes the differentia between the specifically religious, and the scientific-secular, attitude to the Universe, and also creates "the issue that confronts religion itself in one of the most serious crises of its development." But this is no antiquated anthropomorphism. Quite the contrary; the demarcation of the essentially personal aspects of Religion from the impersonal, the secular and the scientific forms one of the most original and valuable features of the entire argument. In the first place, primitive Animism and its derivatives themselves provoke the familiar and powerful "drift towards the impersonal," substantiated as this seems to be by every advance in knowledge beyond early and crude superstition, and culminating in Pantheism and the most prominent types of Mysticism. But however emotionally attractive and logically consistent these may appear to be, they fail, in the end, to meet the conditions of man's existence and to satisfy the demands of his being. Usually, I believe, this collapse is averted by the impossibility of any genuinely coherent formulation of such systems; and if, on the other hand, they pursued their principles to the bitter end, they would prove (to resume the author's own weighty con- tention) that Religion is absolutely inseparable from the instinctive and ineradicable desire for existence which, no matter how refined and elevated it may become, must ever retain its inherent finitude, simply because man is a finite being. "Religion," therefore, "is a phenomenon of finitude, and to remove the finite factor is to cancel our concept of religion altogether." This formulation of the Hegelian principle of Negativity, of course, neither questions the incalculable value of Mysticism nor imposes any narrow limits on finitude, as such; this, to employ a scientific illustration, may expand like the Lemaitre Universe, which nevertheless remains finite! From the purely religious standpoint, then, thoroughgoing Mysticism is self-destructive: "to be completely lost in God is to lose God completely. To become one with the One that knows no other is to cease to be His worshipper. Brahmanism is the nemesis of oriental religion; Buddhism is the nemesis of 94</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS Brahmanism. As a solution of the religious problem of existence, mysticism breaks down."' In the opposite direction, similarly, "a universe which is all God is as incompatible with religion as a universe in which a god is altogether wanting" -the Universe, in other terms, of thoroughly consistent secularism and impersonalist Science. This Universe and these cultures must, nevertheless, be assigned their due r6le in human life; and this is achieved by Religion itself, as it steadily develops, creating the domain of the secular as the sole method of transcending "its own animistic beginnings." "For the purposes of religion," then, "man must be thought of as man"-the essence of sane secularism-"just as nature must be thought of as nature," as pure Science quite logically insists. In other words, recalling what has already been argued about Mysticism, "it is a necessity of religion that the human agent should not lose himself in continual preoccupation with God; he must perforce differentiate his attitude towards the things of this world in such a way that religion itself prescribes." Thus (to repeat) Religion conserves its essence and ensures its advance; for it continues to pivot on personality, and neither secularism nor scientific impersonalism can deprive even the scientist of his humanity. The apparent "retreat of the religious attitude in face of the secularist," therefore, must be viewed in its true light as beina "one with the movement whereby religion becomes clearly and consistently theistic, and theism definitely spiritual." Once it has shed its animistic and crudely anthropomorphic swaddling- clothes, then, Theism involves "a stupendous dualism, a fundamental duality in the nature of things, which is at the basis of all religion." Man himself shares this duality, even while he observes and investigates it; and in realizing himself to be "a finite personality," he must conceive God as "the correlate of a completed personality in man." Not at all, however, in any abstract, arbitrary or artificial manner, but naturally and intrinsically: "the existence of a personal God is the necessary implicate of all personal experience . . . man's practical belief in his personality implies the existence of a personal God"; on the other hand, "the discovery of order in the world does not necessarily imply the existence of an omnipresent Intelligence." This should suffice to show that the arguments advanced are original as well as weighty. "The supreme reality is personal in character"; "God must be a person" in the sense that He is "the Being to whom we cannot relate our personalities in any other way (than) in their synthetic completeness"-a criterion that is unmistakably pragmatic, though by no means easy; while at the opposite pole "the concept of nature serves to stereotype the impersonal interpretation of the world" on which all Science is based. It is, however, impossible, within the limits of a Review, to do justice to the application of these principles to other fundamentally important aspects of human experience-to Ethics, marked by a devastating criticism of naturalistic moral theory; to genuine creativeness within even man's activities, and attaining its perfection in the divine; to the proper functions of History and Art. But in conclusion I should like to remove any suspicion that the author ever yielded to the besetting temptation of the philosopher -over-intellectualization. On the contrary: "Philosophy can never hope to take the place of experience.... Religion is not truly religion until it has incorporated the moral life.... Religion goes behind all intimacies of experience to the universal groundwork of reality. . . . Effectual belief in 1 This finds a remarkable confirmation in The Bhagavadgita: " When one sees Me every- where, and sees everything in Me, I am never lost to him, nor is he lost to Me."

This Mysticism, in other words, is by no means absolute. 95</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY the personality of God means more than a theoretical belief that God is a person. . . . No religion can live on its ideals alone." Inadequate though this must be, it should ensure the keenest interest in the forthcoming sequel, A Sacramental Universe. J. E. TURNER. From Morality to Religion. By W. G. DE BURGH, F.B.A. (Macdonald &amp; Evans. I938. Crown 8vo. Pp. xxi + 374. Price I2s. 6d. net.) In these Gifford Lectures Professor de Burgh continues his defence of Reason in its wider interpretation to cover intuitive as well as discursive thinking. Reason thus interpreted is a function of man's whole nature, and includes the activities of the mind in moral, aesthetic, and religious thinking, as well as in science and philosophy; it is "integrated with the will and the emotions in the living growth of personality." This conception of Reason is supported by accounts of its functioning in ethical and religious experience. Referring to these Professor de Burgh writes: "My purpose is twofold. I want first to show how moral experience presents a problem which philosophy is unable to solve, and which points to religion for its solution. The problem is that of the dualism of ethical principles, according as conduct is motivated by the thought of obligation or by desire for a rational good. Secondly, I shall consider the larger issue of the relationship by way of action and reaction, of morality to religion and of religion to morality." Professor de Burgh is aware that by his analysis and description of rational activity in these two important spheres he is attempting only a limited contribution towards the solution of his major problem. "A complete solution," he tells us, "calls for collaboration of many thinkers working forward, each from his chosen angle, to the unification of the fruits of rational inquiry in science, art, morals, and metaphysics, and with the knowledge revealed in religious experience"; but no one who follows his weighty arguments can doubt the importance of the contribution he has made. Professor de Burgh's examination of ethical experience leads him to distinguish what he regards as two independent types of ethical activity: action for duty's sake, and action sub ratione boni. The key lies in the dis- tinction between theoria and praxis, the former being pure praxis and the latter praxis governed by theoria. While endeavouring to do justice to the claims of both ideals, Professor de Burgh is mainly concerned to establish the independence and autonomy of each. "We should be shutting our eyes to the facts," he holds, "if we ignored or minimized a fissure that cuts deep into the structure of man's ethical nature." In the main Professor de Burgh accepts Kant's conception of moral obligation, but he departs from Kant by insisting upon the existence and importance of another type of ethical experience. Kant fell into error, he holds, when failing to recognize the worth of action sub ratione boni. The discussion of these two forms raises for Professor de Burgh the central question: Can the concept of obligation be derived from that of good? His reply is decisive, for he is convinced that this can't be established by any philosophical argument. He is led to this conclusion by a comparison of what appear to him radically conflicting characters in these two kinds of experience. These may be summarized as follows: (I) Moral obligation or duty is purely formal, unconditional, and absolute. It is universal, and is apprehended intuitively as such in every particular moral act. Duty can't be justified by anything other than morality; and there is no answer to the question: 96</page></plain_text>
