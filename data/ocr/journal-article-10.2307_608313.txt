<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMA PHILOSOPHIAE OF AL-SHAHRASTANi : Kitab Nihayatu 'l-Iqddm fi 'ilmi 'l-Kalam. Edited with a translation by A. GUILLAUME. pp. xvi + 173, 514. Oxford University Press (Humphrey Mil- ford), 1934. 42s. Students of Islam will congratulate Dr. Guillaume on having finished this book and will thank him for it; it is a solid piece of work, well done. There is nothing to add to what was said about the text in an earlier review (Bulletin, vi, p. 1019) ; there may be six mis- prints, all minor ones. Apart from the subject the book is difficult, for several reasons. The author's method is indirect, his argument eddies round the subject, approaching it now from one side, now from another. He states the views of his opponents sometimes singly and sometimes in groups and, as he is not careful to make clear whether he is speaking or quqting someone else, it is easy for the reader to lose his way. Sometimes also he does not finish his argument neatly, but leaves it with a ragged end. Al-Shahrastani was a big man, an acute thinker, and singularly free from prejudice. This book gives the philosophical foundation of Islam; in it the author condemns many errors, often giving the names of their authors. Now Bishr al-Marisi was the bad boy of Muslim theology. Many writers tell nasty tales about him. One is that his mother asked al-Shafi'i to reason with her son and bring him back to orthodoxy because his heresy made him unpopular. He is never mentioned in this book because he was of no account as a philosopher. 1 Cf. le necrologe de R. Ramsay Wright par M. R.

"A man's own need is more apparent to him than an external potentiality's need of a necessary " (50/125). The statements of his faith are often noble and inspiring. His view of man's duty is a paraphrase of: " When you have done all that is commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants for we have done that which it was our duty to do." In addition to editing the text Dr. Guillaume has interpreted it. He has translated the first two chapters almost in full and given of the rest a summary which varies from a translation to the barest epitome. The version is easier than the original. The mixture of translation and summary enables the reader to follow the argument, though here and there he may have to refer to the Arabic to explain some phrase. A few corrections may be suggested. p. 44/105 for JKAiO read J1 and translate: Muh1ammad ibn al-Haisam laboured at all the problems of anthropomorphism till he reduced the divergence to what could be discussed and was not nonsense, except that of phenomena. He left that on the first loom, i.e. un- changed, following his master (cf. Milal, p. 83, 11. 9-14). p. 23/48. Because what he does is more perfect than what he does not do. Read : What can act is more perfect than what cannot act. p. 131/410. The Mu'tazila held views, etc. Read : The Mu'tazila have a theory about pain. According to al-Ash'ari it can happen only by God's decree. p. 107/323 conversations, but they do not determine, etc. Read: Often we call them psychic conversations, metaphorically or really; but they are suppositions connected with the expressions on the tongue. In several places the variant in the notes is translated, not the text. Twice the text is tacitly corrected; on p. 89/257 Abu'l-Husain stands rightly for Abu 'l-Hasan. Chapter 17 deals with the moral law, so right and wrong are better suited to the subject than honourable and base, which stand in the title and elsewhere in the chapter. Other suggestions are:- p. 5/13 in finitude; read: by a finite quantity. p. 12/29 twice that of the moon; read : many times that of the moon. p. 31/69 the one does not destroy the other; read: he is never without this.

These proposed changes may amount to half a page, a very small proportion of the book. This book took twelve years to prepare; a quick reading with an eye on a review has not done justice to the labour involved. A. S. T.</page></plain_text>
