<plain_text><page sequence="1">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi: Theological Cognitivism, Noncognitivism, and a Proof of Prophecy from Scriptural Contradiction Ayman Shihadeh University of Edinburgh What would a good theologian do when faced with Qur'anic statements that are, one way or another, problematic, either when considered in themselves, or if they appear inconsistent?1 Such problems are unavoidable, both in the process of constructing a cogent theology, and more acutely so in the need to provide apologetic responses to both doubts raised around them by opponents of the religion as a whole and to the misuse of such problematic scriptural statements by coreligionists. Muslim theologians have offered diverse approaches to dealing with scriptural problems, ranging from more or less rationalist ones, which start by acknowledging at least some of these problems, to fideist approaches, which will deny their problematic nature in the first place. If a problem is acknowledged, a theologian may then attempt to resolve it, or may suspend rational enquiry and judgement thereon, bracketing it as an insoluble problem. In any case, the problem will be dealt with in one of two broad ways: it will be either resolved or averted. A theologian may go as far as contending that what appears to be a problem is not actually a problem, but will not go any further to pretend that, on the contrary, it is somehow a positive thing. One theologian, Najm al-Din al-Tufi, thought otherwise. He felt he could do better and go a step further. A certain class of problematic scriptural statements, he argued, purely on account of their problematic nature may have a positive role to play: they could be turned into evidence for the veracity of scripture. This strange position, which does not necessarily exclude the other, standard approaches, is put forth in the context of his treatment of apparently contradictory scriptural statements relating to the problem of destiny. He presents this alongside a more standard treatment of this problem, which is of interest in its own right. In what follows, we will start by examining this treatment, before turning to al-Tufi's proof of prophecy from scriptural contradiction. First of all, I will introduce al-Tufi and the sources. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The Context Najm al-Din Sulayman ibn cAbd al-Qawi al-Tufi (d. 716/1316) wrote on theology, Hanbali jurisprudence, Qur'anic exegesis, Arabic grammar and literature, and Hadith. Like many of his fellow Hanbalis, he practised kalam and adhered to doctrines that are normally associated with the Ashcari school.2 Moreover, crucially for the present study, he was a proponent of logic, in line with the dominant trend among the mutakallimun of his period. He wrote an apparently non-extant defence of logic and kalam entitled Raf al-malam can ahl al-mantiq wa'l-kalam ('Annulling the Denunciation of the Practitioners of Logic and kalam').3 Al-Tuf! has been relatively neglected in modern scholarship. He is nowadays famous mostly for his radical version of the juristic principle of unsupported interest (maslaha mursala).4 Yet, more broadly, in the style, contents and often the overall rubrics of his writings, he is, in numerous ways, a highly unconventional thinker, as will become apparent in the present article. This unconventionality owes partly to the fact that he appears to be influenced by often incompatible trends, including rationalist and traditional theological trends. The present study will have as its main sources and immediate context the following three of al-Tufi's books, the first two especially: 1) Al-Intisarat al-Islamiyya fi kashf shubah al-Nasraniyya (Tslamic Victories in Exposing Christian Fallacies') This book was completed in Cairo on 7 Rajab 707/2 January 1308, and then underwent minor revisions and additions, which were completed on 11 Shawwal 708/24 March 1309.5 It was written in response to an anonymous polemical work by a Christian author, in which, according to al-Tufi, 'he attacks the religion of Islam and attempts to undermine the prophecy of Muhammad'.6 Al-Tufi writes that although that book is well-known to his contemporaries, no one knows the identity of its author.7 Nonetheless, it is evident that the text was written during the 7th/13th century, as it quotes several Arabic sources, the latest apparently being Ibn Rushd (d. 595/1198) and Maimonides (d. 601/1204). The Intisarat responds to the points made in the polemical work in their original order, and cites or sometimes paraphrases many passages therefrom. Most of the arguments target statements from the Qur'an and the Hadith.8 2) Dar3 al-qawl al-qabih bVl-tahsin wa'l-taqbih ('Refuting the Reprehensible Position of Ethical Rationalismy) Written in 708/1308-9, and recently published for the first time on the basis of a unique manuscript,9 this work is dedicated to ethical theory and the related problem of destiny. In chapter one, al-Tufi provides a general refutation of Muctazili ethical</page><page sequence="3">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 3 theory, before addressing particular problems in theology, the principles of jurisprudence (usiil al-fiqh), and substantive law (furuc al-fiqh), in three separate chapters. Next, chapter five introduces the problem of destiny and the main relevant theories, then refutes the MuctazilT affirmation of the autonomy of human action in detail by responding to arguments put forth by AbuT-Husayn al-Basri (d. 436/1044), and through a lengthy and unique commentary on (pseudo-?) al-Hasan al-Basri's (d. 110/728) Risala fi'l-qadar ('Epistle on Destiny'), cited fully in cAbd al-Jabbar's (d. 415/1025) Tabaqat al-Muctazila. Chapter six is dedicated to scriptural evidence relating to the problem of destiny, and consists of the following parts: (1) a commentary on all Qur'anic ayas that affirm God's determination of human acts; (2) a brief outline of the Muctazili usage of Qur'anic evidence to support their doctrine of the autonomy of human action; (3) a brief response to the MuctazilT usage of such evidence; (4) a related proof of the prophecy of Muhammad; and (5) a collection of hadiths that affirm God's determination of human acts. 3) Al-Isharat al-ildhiyya ild'l-mabahith al-usuliyya ('Divine Pointers to Questions of [Theological and Juristic] Principles'). Completed on 23 Rabic al-Tham 716/14 July 1316, this is a unique commentary on all Qur'anic ayas relating to either theology (the 'principles of religion', usul al-din) or the principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh), and is one of al-Tufi's most important works.10 This book too has remained unpublished until recently. The Noncognitive Position Our point of departure will be the Intisarat, which begins with three general preliminary principles (muqaddimat) that anticipate many of the arguments put forth by the Christian writer, and thus form the bases for much of the apologetic discussion that follows later in the book. What concerns us most in the present article is the second principle, which relates to scriptural statements that the mind finds theologically problematic or inadmissible, one way or another.11 Al-Tufi here presents a nuance of one common trend in Sunni theology, to which I will refer as the 'noncognitive position', a designation that I propose to use in preference over 'bi-ld kayftf or the awkward verbal noun 'balkafa'.12 A noncognitive theological position is one in which some scriptural theological statements ought to be accepted in the form in which they are received, without apprehension of the true referents of their ambiguous constituent expressions. One affirms these scriptural statements while suspending both the conceptions to which their ambiguous parts would ordinarily refer, and further enquiry into their subject</page><page sequence="4">4 Journal of Qur'anic Studies matter which may lead to different, non-ordinary interpretations. Beyond this central doctrine, there were contrasting views among later theologians on what exactly one should suspend in the ordinary conception, and whether one may gain any information from ambiguous scriptural expressions. Some, such as Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328), took a 'qualified noncognitive' attitude and inclined towards affirming (ithbat) both the statements, often formulaically, and their ordinary meanings, adding 'bi-la kayfa' or another phrase negating modality (kayfiyya) to suspend only conceptions of how these meanings are true of divine nature. Others, especially within the kalam tradition, espoused the 'stronger' attitude of 'delegation' (tafwid, which means the same as taslim 'acquiescent assent'), whereby one affirms merely the words in ambiguous scriptural statements as they are in their original form, and suspends the ordinary meanings thereof, 'delegating' the matter to God. For them, modality is inseparable from the ordinary meaning of an expression; wherefore, it will be irrational to affirm the latter but suspend the former. Both attitudes are ascribed by their proponents to the pious predecessors (salaf). Al-Tufi contrasts the noncognitive position to the view that the referents of the contents of disputed scriptural statements are intelligible (macqul)}3 Noncognitive positions indeed are intended, at least in principle, to avert both anthropomorphic notions of divine nature, perceived as unbefitting of God, and other non-literal cognitive interpretations, which are considered to undermine the integrity of scripture. The role of the mind, al-Tufi maintains in the beginning of the Intisarat, is to establish the foundations (qawacid) of religion, these being the existence and oneness of the Creator; that the world is generated; the possibility of prophecy; and the prophecy of actual prophets. Once these foundations are proven, the truth of a specific revealed, scriptural religion (sharc) as a whole will be established, at which point reason will retire (incazala). The contents of scriptural religion will then have to be accepted (qubul), whether the mind apprehends (adraka) them, or fails to do so. In the latter case, one ought to assent acquiescently (taslim) to such scriptural statements as they are, obediently following the Lawgiver (taqlid al-sharic). Al-Tufi adds, however, that scripture does not, and cannot conceivably, contain anything irrational (ma yunafi'l-caql)\ it may contain statements that, though to some extent incomprehensible, refer to things that are in themselves possible. He then briefly offers a partial, soteriological rationale for this principle, which he seems to discuss at greater length in al-Qawacid al-sughra, an apparently non-extant book. Forms of worship (cibadat), he contends, demand much effort on the part of the believer, and comprise obligations (takalif) on the two parts of the human being: the body and the soul.14 This effort is thus either practical (camali) or cognitive (cilmi), for example, the belief in unobservable things (ghuyub) referred to in the Qur'anic statement Those who believe in the unseen and keep up the prayer</page><page sequence="5">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 5 (Q. 2:3).15 This cognitive effort is the harder of the two types, the hardship therein stemming from the fact that the rational soul is inherently inclined to fathoming what it becomes aware of, and will experience pain and perturbation (idtirab) when it fails to do so.16 Such beliefs, it seems therefore, should have their basis in the believer's will. It will thus require a 'leap' to achieve the fullness of faith, to believe it 'against the understanding' - to cite Kierkegaard, a more radical fideist, writing in a different, yet not unrelated, context.17 Most Muslim theologians will resort to a noncognitive attitude in some theological problems and contexts. Yet they differ on both its 'strength' and the sets of particular problems that they will consider insoluble, and consequently on the extent of noncognitive scriptural theology they can tolerate in a theological system before charging it with irrationalism. This tension manifested itself in a debate on whether God's speech may contain parts that humans cannot understand, which may thus seem redundant and futile.18 Typically, the Muctazila will offer cognitive assessments of most theological problems, accusing Ashcaris of irrationalism for offering a noncognitive assessment of some problems. Some Ashcaris, in turn, will accuse traditionalists of irrationalism both for making such an assessment in relation to a wider range of problems, and for the strand of noncognitivism that they adhere to. Al-Tufi appeals to the noncognitive stance in his discussions of a number of particular theological problems, many of which fall within the broad problem of the nature of divine attributes, which he discusses in the Intisardt. The anonymous polemicist responded to in this book cites statements from the Hadith implying anthropomorphism in divine nature (e.g. by referring to God's hand, or His descent to the lower heaven) - this, he argues, is irrational.19 For most of these cases, al-Tufi states that three main theological approaches have been put forth: (a) affirming the literal meaning of expressions that suggest anthropomorphism (tashbih), or corporealism (tajslm); (b) interpreting them non-literally (taJwil), to affirm a deanthropomorphic (tanzlh) sense (e.g. 'God's descent' will be interpreted as the descent of knowledge or mercy from Him); and (c) 'believing what befits God's greatness' of these statements, while declaring that God does not resemble His creatures in any of His attributes.20 Al-Tufi accepts the last position, which, unlike the first two, is noncognitive, and seeks to avoid both literalist anthropomorphic affirmation (ithbat) and its antithesis, which is to divest God (tactll) of certain of His attributes said to be delineated in scripture.21</page><page sequence="6">6 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The Problem of Destiny: Noncognitive and Cognitive Positions The mutakallimun generally upheld more or less detailed theories of human action, supporting one position or another with respect to the autonomy of human action vis a-vis divine power. There was also a widespread noncognitive trend in approaching the problem of destiny, most notably among more traditionally-inclined theologians and non-philosophically-oriented Sufis, to whom the notion of destiny had immense soteriological importance, as it is applied in both contemplative and practical attitudes in everyday life. In this trend, destiny will be treated essentially as an incomprehensible mystery, a secret (sirr), because of the theological dilemmas it 22 raises. Consequently, scriptural statements on this aspect of divine action will be viewed in the same light as the aforementioned scriptural statements that suggest anthropomorphic divine attributes: they ought to be accepted and affirmed as they are, without interpretation by recourse to a rational theory.23 Different hadlths, some considered inauthentic, were cited in this regard: for instance, 'Do not discuss destiny! For it is a secret that belongs to God. Divulge not a secret of God!'24 Al Tufi cites another hadith, in which God, upon being asked about destiny by Moses, Jesus and al-cUzayr, reportedly says, 'You are servants of Mine; and this is one of My secrets, and I should not be called to account for what I do (la usJalu camma afaluY?5 Al-Tufi expresses this noncognitive view in the Dar\ where he argues that the problem of destiny is most perplexing because of the fact that the mind is able to provide arguments in support of the different, opposing possible positions, which moreover seem to find support in various ways in different scriptural statements. The mind finds reasons to support both the view that human acts are voluntary, and the view that they are ultimately determined, either by God directly or by natural processes. Human acts, however, cannot be at once both voluntary and determined; they cannot be produced, in the same respect, by God and by the human agent.26 There also seems to be a contradiction between the view that they are produced entirely by God, and holding human agents responsible for their acts. With these _ 27 questions in mind, al-Tufi outlines his approach to the problem in the Dar3: [T]he problem of destiny is one of the divine mysteries (sirr min asrdr Allah), the nature and reality of which no human being has a 28 route to realise, except by the will of God ... Indeed, our objective, and the objective of others, in discussing it is to respond to the fallacies of opponents ... Once their falsehood is made apparent, one will revert to what revealed religion (sharc) stipulates, namely having belief (imdn) and acquiescent assent (taslim) in a heart that is sound and unadulterated by fallacies ...</page><page sequence="7">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 7 Therefore, when we address the discussions of Qadaris on this problem, we only respond to them in the manner of rebuttal (mudafaca) and arguments ad hominem (ilzam), by showing that the dubiosity (ishkal) that they raise will in fact apply to their own position. We will not seek to establish the truth on this matter positively by affirming something that the mind leads to in the same way it leads to the fallacies of our opponents. Even Abu cAbd Allah [Fakhr al-Din] al-Razi, despite his great learning in kalam and his knowledge of the methods of proof and refutation, when he related AbuT-Husayn [al-Basri]'s fallacies ... and responded to them, he said, Tf it is said, "What then is to be done (ma'l-hila)?\ one should say, What should be done is to abandon the effort [of enquiry] (al-hila tark al-hila), and to revert to His saying He cannot be called to account for anything He does, whereas they will be called to account. Elsewhere, he notes that this aya is known among some Sunnis as the 'verse of the mace' (ayat al-dabbus), in reference to the stern authoritative prohibition from further questioning, which it implies.30 In the Dar3, al-Tufi dedicates two lengthy chapters to the subject of destiny, designed to serve the general approach he outlines above. Chapter five, as already mentioned, briefly introduces the problem and the main relevant theories, then refutes the Muctazili theory of the autonomy of human action, thus serving a primarily negative, refutative purpose. Chapter six serves the positive purpose of affirming scriptural statements on destiny inductively by extracting (istiqra3) and commenting on all relevant Qur'anic ayas, showing that they support the common Sunni doctrine that God determines all human acts, while affirming human responsibility. This inductive method of thoroughly surveying the Qur'an to extract, and comment on, relevant ayas serves the general approach by providing a mechanism for establishing the scriptural position on the problem at hand.31 This may allow a 'tipping of the balance' (tarjlh) towards one possible doctrine rather than another. Nonetheless, the result of this process in this context is likely to be a noncognitive belief, a simple faithful assent, in God's determination of human acts, without the complete apprehension of the nature of the object of this belief. As it turns out, however, al-Tufi does not seem to adhere to this stance consistently in his works, including the Dar3. The problem of destiny appears to be one of the places where a more general conflict comes to surface between often incompatible traditionalist and rationalist kalam streaks in his thought. The latter comes to the fore in both the Dar3 and the Intisarat, where al-Tufi is apparently pressed by the debate</page><page sequence="8">8 Journal of Qur'anic Studies with his Muctazill and Christian opponents into taking a stronger stance with respect to the problem of destiny than the noncognitive position, which may seem dialectically weak. Such weakness may appear in a noncognitive theological position, first, because it may seem as an intellectually uninteresting option, as it leaves things unexplained (thus, as al-Tufi points out, it will go against the general human urge to understand),32 and second, because it is vulnerable to problematic cognitive interpretation, which may be forced upon it by opponents.33 We shall first turn briefly to the Intisarat, where, following his response to the charge of anthropomorphism, al-Tufi cites a different charge, namely that many statements in both the Qur'an and the Hadith affirm predeterminism and God's creation of human acts. Referring to Sunni Muslims specifically, the anonymous polemicist then notes that when the heinous nature of this doctrine is made clear to them, they respond merely by reciting Q. 21:23, He cannot be called to account for anything He does, whereas [human beings] will be called to account, a reference, in this context, to the noncognitive position. He then attacks this position using two commonplace arguments of a primarily ethical nature, which were used by Muctazilis and were likewise familiar to Christian theologians.34 First, whoever wills evil is evil; if God wills the evils committed by humans, He himself will be evil. Second, God prohibits things that He does not will, and creates things that He wills; therefore, if He creates something that He prohibits, then He both wills and does not will the same thing, which is inconceivable. These two arguments had readily-available answers, and do not pose any difficulty for al-Tufi. For instance, he responds to the latter argument using the standard Sunni distinction between God's cosmogonic will (irada takwiniyya) and His normative will (irada taklifiyya). There is no contradiction, thus, if God both prohibits certain acts and creates them, or commands certain acts, yet determines that some humans omit them.35 Yet al-Tufi goes beyond responding to these two arguments to tackling the broader problem of scriptural statements on the autonomy and determination of human acts, raised by the anonymous polemicist. What interests us most in the present context is whether he here adheres to the noncognitive position, or whether he advances a theory in support of the doctrine that God determines human acts. In one response, he appeals to the foregoing principle established in the beginning of the Intisarat, arguing that the problem of destiny is not among the most primary problems in Islamic theology. Therefore, if one establishes the principles of theology, including the prophecy of Muhammad, one should then accept this doctrine as presented in scripture.36 This response can immediately lead to a suspension of rational enquiry on the subject, and to the noncognitive position, and consequently the end of the discussion. However, other responses that al-Tufi puts forth take a different turn.</page><page sequence="9">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 9 Referring to the Qur'anic ayas cited by the anonymous polemicist, he writes that Muslims unanimously hold both that the statements of the Qur'an are all truthful and that its whole text is internally consistent and coherent. All parts thereof must agree (yuwdfiqu bacduhu bacdan). Exegetes, therefore, attempt to harmonise seemingly contradictory parts (md awhama'l-tacdrud) in various 'acceptable' ways. As quoted in the Intisdrdt, the Christian author only attacks what he perceives as the Qur'an's absolute affirmation of predestination. By referring to the above contradiction, al-Tufi probably aims to indicate that the picture is considerably more complex than that. Yet this also introduces another crucial problem to the context: that scriptural statements on this subject appear contradictory. As mentioned, some scriptural statements ascribe, in different ways, the production of, and the responsibility for, human acts to God (e.g. Q. 37:96, It is God who has created you and all that you do), while others ascribe them to humans (e.g. Q. 2:79, They write the Scripture with their own hands). Exegetes, he continues, have taken three approaches to resolving this situation: (a) some affirm the prima facie (zdhir) sense of the former class of ayas, interpreting the latter class non-literally (awwala); (b) some affirm the prima facie sense of the latter, interpreting the former non-literally; and (c) some take a middle ground, affirming 37 ? that God creates human acts, while human agents 'acquire' (kasaba) them . Al-Tufi places himself in the last group. He seems to consider that the standard Ashcari theory of acquisition resolves the cosmogonic problem of who produces human acts and the ethical problem of who bears responsibility for them, thereby harmonising 38 relevant Qur'anic statements that appear contradictory. Al-Tufi moves yet further from noncognitivism here by proposing another theoretical solution to the problem of destiny, which also aims at resolving seeming scriptural contradictions. This he considers to be the essence of destiny (nuktat al qadar), or its secret (sirr al-qadar), for which he refers the reader to a fuller discussion in the Dar3, to which we should now return.39 Indeed, in various places in the Dar3, one finds elements of a coherent theory of destiny. Human action is considered from two main angles: in its relation to nature and the human agent (the observable level, al-shahid), and in its relation to God (the unobservable level, al-ghd3ib). With respect to the latter angle, al-Tufi establishes that human acts are determined by reference to God's foreknowledge of all future events. Since God's foreknowledge implies the necessity of all events, human agents will be unable to choose their acts autonomously.40 With respect to the former, he adopts Fakhr al-Din al-Razi's theory of motivation, which leads to a natural determinism: the human agent's acts are determined by his motives, which in turn are either determined by natural circumstances, or created by God directly in the agent's mind.41 Along these lines, he writes that God creates human nature with</page><page sequence="10">10 Journal of Qur'anic Studies different parts, including the rational part and the non-rational self with its base desires. These parts motivate the agent in conflicting directions. He then explains God's guiding (tawfiq) an agent as His creating a motive in the agent's heart driving him to do good in accordance with the inclination of his rational part. His leading an agent astray (idldl), on the other hand, is explained either as His producing a motive in the agent driving him to act in accordance with his non-rational part, or simply as His omitting to create any motive in the agent to do good, which leaves the agent prey to the influence of the non-rational parts.42 Neither of these two arguments - that from God's foreknowledge, and that from human motivation - is novel. Yet al-Tufi combines them in a novel way into what he describes as the essence, or secret, of destiny. He argues that God creates each person with a certain constitution, which determines that person's acts:43 He knows that this group will do nothing but good and obedience, even if they are left to act freely in accordance with their choice (ikhtiydr) and to produce (khdliq) their acts. And [He knows] that that group will do nothing but evil and disobedience, even if they are left to act freely in accordance with their choice and to produce their acts. [This is so] because of the way in which He predisposed the souls of each of these two groups to necessarily produce good or bad, in the same way that a rock falls and that fire ascends. As such, God's foreknowledge includes (al-Tufi would not say, 'is dependent on') knowledge of both the natural causes and their effects within the psyche of each human agent. God knows, al-Tufi continues, that whether the agent is given the ability to choose and produce his own acts, or whether God creates the agent's acts, there will be no difference between the acts that the agent would perform. The crucial difference between the two models lies in that the latter model (whereby God creates the acts of human agents) preserves His absolute power and majesty, whereas the former does not. For this reason, God will choose to preserve His absolute power (as well as the appearance of natural causality) by creating all things Himself, replacing a deterministic natural causality with His direct determination of everything, including human acts. Now we know the 'secret of destiny', its 'essence'. The doctrine of God's determination of human acts no longer consists of a mere noncognitive belief. As with the theory of acquisition, this notion of the secret of destiny offers to resolve scriptural contradiction with respect to both the cosmogonic question of who produces human acts (these are attributed in the Qur'an to both God and human beings), and the moral problem of how a human agent can be responsible for one's own acts.</page><page sequence="11">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 11 The same model of human action appears in the Isharat, where al-Tufi first discusses the 'vacillation of evidence' (taraddud al-adilla), both scriptural and rational, relating to the determination or autonomy of human acts,44 before 'unveiling the secret of destiny'45 In this book, he appears even more distant from the noncognitive approach to destiny. Commenting on the foregoing 'verse of the mace' (where, as mentioned above, 'mace' is a metaphor for the prohibition of rational enquiry), he writes: 'When considering the secret of destiny as we have explained, it becomes evident that the matter is clear through reason (bi'l-macqul), not by the mace.'46 Al-Tufi's clear hesitation between the noncognitive stance and a cognitive one appears due to his assessment that the mind cannot reach certainty with respect to any solution to the problem of destiny. All available evidence is inconclusive and conjectural (zanni), partly because it is contradictory; and it can only provide, or support probable belief 47 It follows that any cognitive solution to the problem will ultimately be guesswork, and cannot be upheld with complete confidence without admitting that the noncognitive position is ultimately safest. A Proof of Prophecy from Scriptural Contradiction Al-Tufi appears to have given especial attention to the problem of scriptural contradiction, to which he dedicates a separate work, more on which below. In the Dar\ this problem comes to the fore in chapter six, where al-Tufi considers Qur'anic evidence in affirmation of God's determination of human acts,48 then goes on to briefly discuss ayas that the Muctazila cite in affirmation of free human choice. Ayas imply this, they maintain, in the following ten ways:49 (i) Ascribing acts to human beings; e.g. Q. 2:79, They write the Scripture with their own hands. (ii) Praising the obedient, and censuring the disobedient, for their deeds, and linking them to reward and punishment; e.g. Q. 40:17, Today each soul will be rewarded with whatever it has earned. (iii) Affirming the inconceivability of God's committing injustice; e.g. Q. 4:40, God does not wrong [anyone] by as much as the weight of a speck of dust. (iv) Censuring the disobedient for their deeds; e.g. Q. 38:75, What prevents you from bowing down? (v) Giving people choice between performance and omission; e.g. Q. 18:29, Let those who wish to believe do so, and let those who wish to disbelieve do so. (vi) Commands to hasten to perform acts of obedience; e.g. Q. 3:133, Hurry towards your Lord's forgiveness. (vii) Commands to seek divine assistance, implying that God does only what is good; e.g. Q. 1:5, It is you we ask for help.</page><page sequence="12">12 Journal of Qur'anic Studies (viii) The prophets' admissions of their sins, and their attributing them to themselves; e.g. Q. 7:23, We have wronged our souls. (ix) The unbelievers' and the recusants' admission of their disbelief and disobedience; e.g. Q. 67:9, We did not believe, and we said: 'God has revealed nothing'. (x) Their regret in the afterlife for their neglect (tafrit) in this world; e.g. Q. 6:31, Alas for us that we disregarded this! Al-Tufi replies to the Muctazili use of this evidence in different ways, primarily using the aforementioned distinction between God's normative and cosmogonic types of will, and by reference to the notion of acquisition. He moreover argues that this evidence is countered (mucarad) by more numerous and more unequivocal Qur'anic ayas in support of the position of God's determination of human acts.50 He continues:51 If contradiction occurs between what you cite and what we cite, the two sides will have to be harmonised (wajaba'I-tawfiq bayn al qismayn). This can be done only by linking this to the distinction between the two types of [divine] will that we mentioned, and believing that God is just, and accepting God's decree (hukm), in the same way that we approach ayas relating to divine attributes, with respect to His saying There is nothing like Him [Q. 42:11]. Thus, put in broad terms, al-Tufi attempts to address both problems - that of apparent scriptural evidence for what is considered to be a false doctrine, and that of scriptural contradiction - both cognitively and noncognitively in the ways explained above. Although al-Tufi seems satisfied that such responses resolve this contradiction to some extent (though, as we saw, not absolutely), he then goes on to present a different apologetic approach to this contradiction. He does this in a short discussion, which, he notes, is tangential to the wider context of the book. In this discussion, which I translate fully in the following section, he advances a proof of the prophecy of Muhammad, which is based on his foregoing discussion of Qur'anic statements relating to destiny. So far, the contradiction observable among Qur'anic statements relating to the autonomy or determination of human acts can constitute a major theological and hermeneutic problem, which has to be addressed one way or another, whether cognitively or noncognitively. By contrast, contradiction here is seen as a boon. Al-Tufi argues that the contradiction observable among these Qur'anic statements in itself constitutes a proof for the prophecy of Muhammad, and concurrently for the revealed nature of the Qur'an. The discussion consists of the proof and a response to a possible objection. First of all, the proof can be outlined as follows:</page><page sequence="13">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 13 (i) Muhammad was highly intelligent and demonstrated an outstanding ability in guiding and governing his community. (ii) Intelligent and judicious men avoid contradiction in the texts they author, and edit them as much as possible when contradiction occurs. (iii) Therefore, if Muhammad authored the Qur'an, he would have edited it to resolve any contradictions in it. (iv) Therefore, if Muhammad authored the Qur'an, the Qur'an would not include any contradiction. (v) However, the Qur'an includes apparent contradictions. (vi) Therefore, Muhammad did not edit the Qur'an. (vii) Therefore, Muhammad is not the author of the Qur'an. If Muhammad is not the author of the Qur'an, then, al-Tufi concludes, he must have received it from God as it is, and communicated it to people without any alteration. This final step seems to rely on the following implicit argument: The Qur'an originates from either a human being or God (any other possibility is trivial); it does not originate from a human being (whether Muhammad or anyone else); therefore, it originates from God. Statement (i), al-Tufi maintains, is agreed upon by all people, including believers in Muhammad's prophecy and non-believers. Muhammad's intelligence and ability for good governance are evidenced in his own behaviour, his guidance to his community, and the details of the religion that he established. Statement (ii) is then justified as being known immediately through ordinary human custom (darurat cd-cadd). This has its basis in human nature, as al-Tufi here implies, and as he explains more explicitly slightly later in his response to the objection. Intelligent authors are motivated, for obvious reasons, to edit the texts they author (e.g. books, sermons, letters and poems) to resolve any contradictions they contain. If contradiction is not resolved, the readers or listeners will be repulsed, and will have doubt in the author's reliability. Intelligent authors, moreover, are capable of such editorial work to resolve these contradictions. In other words, they ought to do it, and they are able to do it; so, given that they are rational agents, they normally will do it. Statement (iii) follows from statements (i) and (ii). According to al-Tufi, had Muhammad, a human being, been the author of the Qur'an, he would have avoided these contradictions, or edited them out. He would be both motivated and able to do so, given his intelligence and judiciousness, the relatively small size of the text, the long time that was available to him to edit it, and his awareness of the enormous task that this text had to serve.</page><page sequence="14">14 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Al-Tufi then addresses what he considers to be the only possible serious objection to this proof: If this contradiction constitutes a proof that the Qur'an is revealed and not authored by Muhammad, then could it not be the case that he himself was aware of this fact, and thus deliberately inserted this contradiction himself into the text? In other words, if internal contradiction is inapt and irrational when occurring in texts authored by humans, but can in itself constitute a rational proof for the divine origin of a small, exceptional class of texts, then, if I want to prove the divine origin of a text that I present to people, it will be more rational for me to present an internally contradictory text than an internally consistent one. In such cases, a human author will be rationally motivated to keep, or even include, some contradiction in his text. Al-Tufi's response to this objection is essentially as follows. When faced with a choice between two possible courses of action, a rational agent will normally incline towards the choice that serves the greatest benefit, or prevents the greatest harm. It will be irrational for one who recognises the most advantageous choice, or the least disadvantageous choice, to choose a less advantageous one, or a more disadvantageous one. Let us then consider a claimant of prophecy, who has a choice between presenting people with a book that is internally consistent, and presenting them with one that is internally contradictory. The latter type of book, it seems, has the advantage of containing contradiction, which may constitute a proof for the revealed nature of the book. In this respect, this type will seem as a more rational choice than the former type. Yet al-Tufi then points out that such contradiction will be recognised as a proof only by people who are intelligent and virtuous, who are a minority of humanity, whereas the majority of people will be repulsed by any obvious contradiction, and will become suspicious of that claimant of prophecy. Overall, therefore, the disadvantage that is expected from the reaction of the majority of people will be exceedingly greater than the benefit expected from the approval of the intelligent minority. Al-Tufi concludes that the foregoing objection does not undermine the proof, since an intelligent claimant of prophecy will find that it is more rational to avoid contradiction in the text that he presents to people. And there is no disagreement, he reiterates, concerning the intelligence of Muhammad. Al-Tufi's proof may be condensed in a nutshell (but also in a highly reductive manner) as T believe it because it is contradictory'. One here cannot avoid wondering whether this is not tantamount to the 'credo quia absurdum' (T believe it because it is absurd') position advocated by some Christian theologians. Does al Tufi's apparently rational argument betray a fideism that is even more radical than the more or less moderate fideism of some noncognitive positions, which, as we saw, only allow a deference of the judgement of irrationality against scripture?</page><page sequence="15">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 15 This does not seem to be case: contradiction here, to al-Tufi's mind, does not imply irrationality (as we saw, he maintains more broadly that scripture cannot contain anything irrational).52 It is not a trivial contradiction - this is a crucial qualification to be read into his proof, which is strongly implied in both his discussion of the proof itself and its wider context. Moreover, in more than one place, he describes the scriptural statements he refers to here as being only prima facie contradictory (mutacdrida zdhiran), and thus not constituting real incoherence in an immediate or necessary way. As such, the problem will require further analysis; and, indeed, al Tufi accepts that it is rationally resolvable in different ways, especially the abovementioned, although he admits that none are absolutely satisfactory. Noteworthy in this regard is al-Tufi's defence of logic, to which, as mentioned, he dedicates a separate work. In the Isharat, he comments on Q. 4:82, If [the Qur'an] had been from anyone other than God, they would have found much inconsistency {ikhtilaf) in it, and writes:53 This is an exceptive (istithnd3!) syllogism,54 in which the contradictory of its consequent is added (yustathnd), which gives the antecedent itself, as follows: 'However, they cannot find inconsistency in it; therefore, it is not from anyone other than God; therefore, it is from God, exalted.' He refers the reader to another work entitled Daf al-tacdrud cammd yuhimu'l tandqud fi'l-kitdb wa'l-sunna ('Illustrating that Contradiction [among Scriptural Statements] does not Indicate Incoherence in the Qur'an and Prophetic Tradition'), which unfortunately appears to be non-extant. There, we are told, he argues that although there are cases where Qur'anic statements appear contradictory in the broadest sense (mutlaq al-ikhtilaf), none of these cases satisfy all the conditions (shurut), or restrictions, of real incoherence (al-tandqud al-mahd), i.e. contradiction in the pure formal, logical sense. Although the exact nature of al-Tufi's argument is unknown, given the incomplete account we have in the Isharat, he seems to argue that, once analysed, these statements, or the propositional doctrines that follow once they are interpreted, do not affirm and negate exactly the same thing in exactly the same respect; hence the reference to the conditions of contradiction, which have to be fulfilled in two propositions for them to be contradictory.55 It follows that Qur'anic ayas may be only prima facie contradictory, and do not violate the Aristotelian laws of non-contradiction and the excluded middle.56 It seems also that, in al-Tufi's view, absurdity is plausibly averted in the case of contradiction between scriptural statements on destiny because, as already mentioned, this topic is highly problematic from the perspective of reason. In the Dar3, he considers not only scriptural evidence, but also rational evidence put forth by the different participants in the debate. Although he maintains that some</page><page sequence="16">16 Journal of Qur'anic Studies arguments are stronger than others, and thus tip the balance (yurajjihu) towards one of the two main doctrines, he admits that the truth of neither doctrine is known immediately (maclum biT-darura) or can be held with certainty.57 This is due to the fact that each doctrine has arguments to support it as well as objections and doubts (shubah) raised against it.58 The problem of destiny falls under 'the pulling influence of doubts and evidences' (tajddhubiyyat al-shubah wa'l-adilla) - a metaphor that invokes an object being pulled by different influences in different directions, preventing its movement in any direction.59 Referring to the prima facie contradiction in Qur'anic statements on this subject, he observes that 'rational evidences on this are even more contradictory (ashadd tacdrudanY.60 There is thus something fundamentally perplexing in the problem of destiny itself, which inevitably prevents the mind from apprehension and certitude. The contradiction between statements relating to this problem stems, at least partly, from the inability of the mind to properly comprehend what these statements refer to.61 Thus, al-Tufi's proof is not tantamount to the credo quia absurdum position, although it resembles it superficially in the broad apologetic attitude it assumes: it attempts to transform something problematic into something positive. In this respect, al-Tufi's proof from scriptural contradiction for the prophecy of Muhammad is highly unusual in the context of Islamic theology. No other Muslim theologian, as far as I am aware, ever used Qur'anic statements that are in one way or another problematic in order to prove, purely on the basis of their problematic nature, the revealed nature of the text - this was simply unthinkable. Thus, in the foregoing outline of the proof, statement (v) is the most curious part thereof, and sets it apart from other Islamic theological proofs. As explained above, Muslim theologians are normally content either in attempting to resolve, one way or another, problems that they consider to relate to doctrines that are secondary (furuc) to the more primary foundations of religious belief (e.g. the existence and oneness of God, and prophecy), or in bracketing them in the form of noncognitive doctrines. While most Muslim theologians were engaged primarily in debates with other Muslim theologians, it seems relevant here that al-Tufi was intensely engaged in debate with Christian theologians. As we saw, the anonymous Christian theologian to whom al-Tufi responds in the Intisarat puts forth an argument concerning Qur'anic statements on destiny. In that work, al-Tufi attempts to resolve that particular problem and thus to defuse the argument, as any other Muslim theologian would do. Yet, in the Dar\ he appears to have been emboldened by this debate to go further, turning what was used as an argument against Islam into a proof for it. But if al-Tufi's proof is novel in the Muslim context, could it not have been adapted from Christian theology? I am not aware of comparable proofs in Christian theology either.</page><page sequence="17">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 17 Translation The following is a complete translation of the passage where al-Tufi advances the proof from scriptural contradiction. Having discussed Qur'anic ayas in support of both the Sunni and Muctazili positions, he writes that he wishes 'to mention an interesting point (nukta) that we will advance digressively, and which does not in any way belong to the present discussion. Yet it is derived by way of inference from the Qur'anic ayas on destiny that we have quoted.' He then writes:62 We have cited ayas that are prima facie conflicting (mukhtalifa zdhiran) on the subject of destiny. We then say: the occurrence of these ayas, which are prima facie contradictory (mutacdrida) on this subject, is a compelling proof (hujja) for confirming the prophecy of Muhammad, God bless him and grant him peace, against those who deny it. The said proof may be established [as follows]. Had he not been a real prophet and a true messenger, these contradictory texts would not have been presented by him in his book. However, they have been presented by him. Therefore, he is a true prophet. The conditional statement may be accounted for [as follows]. None of the deniers of his prophecy have ever doubted his virtue and wisdom. Otherwise, he would not have been able to establish his enduring law (ndmus) among [men]. Furthermore, whoever abandons prejudice, and examines his conduct, good character, the way he disciplines his community in good conduct and character, and the primary principles and secondary details of the religion that he established, will know with certainty that he was at the utmost of wisdom and judicious governance (siydsa). This being the case, we say that such immense contradiction is put forth by such a wise person is ordinarily inconceivable, had it in fact not originated from God, Exalted, from Whom [Muhammad] only received it and transmitted it as it is. For we see wise people, who did not establish the like of Muhammad's religion, nor the like of his law (ndmus), such as Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galen and their likes: each one of them will write huge books, the smallest of which being larger in size than the noble Book, yet he will avoid [committing] contradiction in them, so he will not fall into it in any place. Indeed, even [among] uncultured bedouins, one of them will compose a</page><page sequence="18">18 Journal of Qur'anic Studies sermon, a letter, or a long poem, and he will then edit it until not a single contradiction in it remains. Consider then a wise person, who establishes a religion and a law that withstand the passage of time: he presents a book that is small in size, but which, on the face of it, contains this huge amount of contradiction, despite the fact that, according to his opponents, he authored it in the duration of his lifetime, which is 60 years. It is impossible by virtue of ordinary custom (al-cdda tuhilu), given the wisdom of the author, the small size of the book, the long period that it [has survived],63 and the great purpose that it is intended to serve, that he could leave such contradiction in it, or that he would fail to notice it, as it is evident. Therefore, this proves, immediately by virtue of ordinary custom (darurat al-cdda), that indeed he transmitted it from God and delegated (fawwada) the matter to God. This is a compelling proof that relies on immediate knowledge of custom (al-cilm al-darurl al-cadi). I know of only one counterargument that may be presented in reply, which is to say: Tt could be that he inserted this contradiction in his book so that it may be used as a proof for it, as you have shown, and in order to give people the illusion that had this been produced by me, it would not have contained such ambiguities (mutashabihat) and contradictions (mukhtalifat). He would thus indicate to them that it comes from God, although in fact it is not so, in the same way that a magician would give the illusion that his magic is miraculous, although it is not.' The answer is that although what you mentioned may be put forth in the context of defence and disputation, it is actually false when considering established habits. For one premise that sensible people know immediately is to give preference to the greater of two advantageous options, and to avoid the greater of two disadvantageous options. In this vein, a poet once said: If an intelligent person suffers in his limbs From two illnesses, he will treat the more dangerous one.64 Whoever seeks a minor advantage, while neglecting a much greater advantage, or avoids a minor disadvantage and chooses a more severe one, will be judged to be self-evidently stupid by sensible people. However, we have shown the wisdom of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and his knowledge of the principles of good governance. The opponent has accepted this.</page><page sequence="19">Three Apologetic Stances in al-Tufi 19 Hence, had he intended this contradiction and inconsistency in the book that he presents, he would have neglected a certain, major advantage for the sake of a probable, minor advantage, and would have chosen a certain, major disadvantage to avoid a probable, minor disadvantage. At that point, he would be considered stupid; but we have assumed that he is one of the most virtuous wise people; and this involves a contradiction (khulf). This is the case since this [textual] contradiction, given that it is obvious and immediately noticeable to all minds, will cause repulsion in those around [the claimant of prophecy], and will bring about suspicion in him. That will be against his objective, and will cause his supporters to disperse. Thus, if he does it deliberately in order to bring their attention to the foregoing proof, he will have chosen what is minor (marjuh) in preference over what is major (rdjih), as we have mentioned. For the foregoing proof will be discerned only by those who are intelligent and virtuous of human beings, whereas the aforementioned contradiction will be repulsive to all, or most, people. What we have offered shows that the objection is weak, and that the inference that we have put forth is strong. NOTES 1 The traditional distinction between 'clear verses' (muhkamat) and 'ambiguous' ones (mutashabihat) is relevant. 2 On his life and works, see art. 'al-Tufi' in Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edn, vol. 10, pp. 588? 9; W. Heinrich's introduction to his edition of al-Tufi's cAlam al-jadhal fi Him al-jadal (Beirut-Wiesbaden: n.p., 1987), t-yh. Al-Tufi, originally from Iraq, was said, accusingly by some biographers, to have Shici leanings, and he was jailed in Egypt apparently for expressing Rafldi sentiments, which must refer to insulting companions of the Prophet. His works, however, contain frequent, very strong and clearly genuine criticism of various aspects of Shic ism. An exception seems to be a discussion of dissimulation (taqiyya), which appears to tip the balance towards the ShicI point of view (al-Isharat al-ilahiyya ila'l-mabahith al-usuliyya, ed. Hasan Qutub (3 vols, Cairo: al Faruq al-Haditha li'l-Tibaca wa'l-Nashr, 2003), vol. 1, pp. 386-92). In the above Encyclopaedia of Islam entry, Heinrich points to al-Tufi's reference (cAlam al jadhal, p. 53) to 'our JaylanI companions' as evidence of his membership in the Qadiri tariqa. However, the Jaylams referred to here are not the followers of cAbd al-Qadir al-Jaylam, but the Hanbalis of Gaylan, among whom certain juristic views were current. Al-Tufi does not appear to be a Sufi, although, in some places, he accepts certain Sufi views and praises Sufis. He is also highly critical of the ideas of Ibn c Arab!. 3 Mentioned in al-Tufi, Isharat, vol. 3, p. 305. 4 See, for instance, Mustafa Zayd, al-Maslaha fi'l-tashrlc al-Islami wa-Najm al-Din al-Tufi (Cairo: Dar al-Fikr al-cArabi, 1964); Mohammad Kamali, Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society, 1997), pp. 275-6.

Ayman Shihadeh (Riyadh: King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, 2005). 10 The date of completion cited is from the editor's introduction in al-Tufi, Ishardt, vol. 1, p. 127. 11 Al-Tufi, Intisarat, vol. 1, pp. 233-41. 12 There are numerous contemporary discussions of the so-called 'bi-ld kayfa' position in which, to my mind, this phrase, used shorthand for the noncognitive position, often appears as a distraction. The fixation on the phrase by contemporary scholars is unjustified, firstly since the theological position that it is meant to refer to is usually formulated by Muslim theologians without employing the phrase, which is in fact much more dominant among contemporary scholars than among Muslim theologians themselves. Secondly, the phrase 'bi-la kayfd* was used primarily in relation to divine attributes, whereas the noncognitive position is actually applied to a broader range of theological problems. (Some classical discussions in defence of this position are collected in B. Abrahamov, 'The bi-ld kayfa Doctrine and its Foundations in Islamic Theology', Arabica 42 (1995), pp. 364-79.) 13 Al-Tufi, Dar3, p. 257. 14 On the view that the notion of obedience (hence, worship) includes both acts and cognitive assent to the tenets of Islam, see Richard Frank, 'Knowledge and Taqlid: The Foundations of Religious Belief in Classical Ashcarism', Journal of the American Oriental Society 109:1 (1989), pp. 37-62, n. 5, n. 38. 15 For all Qur'anic citations, I have used Muhammad Abdel Haleem's The Qur'an (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), with occasional minor adjustments. 16 A comparable view was reportedly expressed by Muhammad ibn Jacfar ibn al-Zubayr (d. early 2nd/8th century), who states that God tests his servants by ambiguous (mutashdbih) verses in the same way in which He tests them by practical rulings (Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Jami0 al-bayan, ed. M. Shakir and A. Shakir (16 vols to date, Cairo: Dar al-Macarif, 1955-), vol. 6, p. 177). 17 S0ren Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, tr. Howard V.

An opponent will typically attack such a view either by simply charging it with irrationalism, or by forcing a problematic cognitive view thereon, either as a direct interpretation of the original view itself, or as an implication thereof, established in the manner of the argument ad hominem. 22 The expression 'the secret of destiny' is used in relation to highly diverse views. In some cases, the expression is used to suggest that the nature of destiny is unknowable, except to God (for instance, Hibat Allah al-Lalaka% Sharh usul ictiqad ahl al-sunna wa'l-jamdca, ed. A. Hamdan (9 vols, Riyadh: Dar Tiba, 1994), vol. 2, pp. 627 ff.; Ibn cAjiba, al-Bahr al-madid, ed. A. Ruslan (4 vols, Cairo: Hasan cAbbas Zaki, 1999), vol. 1, p. 324 (quoting al-Hakim al Tirmidhi)). In other cases, the nature of destiny is considered a secret that is known only to the elite by some special means, and ought not be divulged, given its great danger to common people or for some other reason; for instance, some Sufis reportedly maintained that 'he who knows the secret of destiny will be an atheist' (Ibn Slna, Risdla fi sirr al-qadar in George Hourani, 'Ibn Sina's essay on the secret of destiny', Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 29 (1966), pp. 25-48, pp. 27-31). Some, however, have no qualms about divulging this 'secret', and seem to treat it as a challenging mystery waiting to be solved. 'Sirf in this case will mean 'elusive quintessence'. 23 Another theologian who opts for the noncognitive position in treating both divine attributes and destiny is Ibn Khaldun (d. 808/1406) (see Harry Wolfson, 'Ibn Khaldun on attributes and predestination', Speculum 34 (1959), pp. 585-97, pp. 596-7). 24 Abu Nucaym al-Isbahani, Hilyat al-awliyd3 (10 vols, Cairo: Maktabat al-Khanjl, 1932-8), vol. 6, p. 182. 25 Al-Tufi, Dar3, p. 163.

There is a complex pun in al-Razi's use of the expression hila (see his al-Arbacin fi usul al-din (Hyderabad: Da3irat al-Macarif al cUthmaniyya, 1353 AH), p. 237). Here, it seems to imply three things: human volition generally (the same as hawl); efforts at finding solutions to such insoluble problems; and argumentative devices (a hint, perhaps, that the Muctazila attempt such desperate measures in this context). 30 Al-Tufi, Dar3, p. 349.1 have been unable to find any other authors referring to this aya by this designation. 31 The method of thoroughly extracting, and commenting on, all Qur'anic ayas relevant to a particular subject is a feature that appears in other works by al-Tufi, including the Isharat, and cAlam al-jadhal. 32 See the above section on 'The Noncognitive Postion'. 33 See above, n. 20. 34 Al-Tufi, Intisardt, vol. 1, pp. 452-3. 35 Al-Tufi, Intisardt, vol. 1, pp. 460-3; cf.

On the theory of acquisition, see Daniel Gimaret, Theories de Tacte humain en theologie Musulmane (Leuven: Peeters, 1980), pp. 68 ff. There were, of course, other Hanballs before al-Tufi who accepted the theory of acquisition; for example, Abu Yacla ibn al-Farra3 (d. 458/1066) (al-Muctamad fi usul al-din, ed. W. Haddad</page><page sequence="22">22 Journal of Qur'anic Studies (Beirut: Dar al-Mashriq, 1974), pp. 126-9); Ibn al-Zaghunl (d. 527/1132) (al-Idah fi usul al din, ed. T. Mahmud (Riyadh: King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, 2003), pp. 455 ff.). 38 Cf. al-Tufi, Dar0, pp. 164-7. Al-Tufi also responds to the Muctazili objection that the notion of 'acquisition', as supposedly distinct from both God's determination of human acts and human autonomy, is actually incomprehensible; it has no cognitive value. 'Kasb\ as such, is 'a word without a referent (ism la musamma lahu)1 (Dar0, p. 331) - this echoes al-RazT (Muhassal afkar al-mutaqaddimin wa'l-muta:'akhkhirin min al-culama0 wa'l-hukama0 wa'l mutakallimin, ed. Husayn Atay (Cairo: Maktabat Dar al-Turath, 1991), p. 470), who also rejects this notion (cf. Shihadeh, Teleological Ethics, p. 40). 39 Al-Tufi, Intisarat, vol. 1, pp. 464-7; Dar0, pp. 235-8, p. 332. A discussion can also be found in the Isharat (vol. 1, pp. 219-21). This reference to the Dar0 seems to have been inserted when the Intisarat underwent some revision in 708/1309. 40 Al-Tufi, Dar0, pp. 223-4. 41 Al-Tufi, Dar0, p. 179. Cf. Shihadeh, Teleological Ethics, pp. 17 ff.

The contrary in fact appears to be implicit in many of the forms of argument that they used.
