I argue that Shahrur's writings take aim at three tenets of Islamic orthodoxy that he views as antithetical to the progressive development of a modem Islamic umma. However, in many ways these writings are less significant for what they say than for how Shahrur has expressed his ideas, toward whom and what he directs his thought, and the ideas that he does and does not explicitly take up in both his critical and constructive analyses. Attention to both the explicit and implicit objects of Shahrur's reformist project is important for assessing the status of the current debate over Islam, its application to modem socio-political practice, and the relative significance of particular reformist writings. The successful propagation of the message of one of the most significant of the so-called "Islamic Luthers" goes a long way toward fostering a democratic, pluralist and at the same time clearly Islamic discourse. Shahrur's Objects of Reform Islamic thinkers commonly distinguish the experiences of Christianity in the West and Islam in the East in order to maintain that ideas such as secularism, or the distinction between state and religion, political and religious society, are irrelevant for Islam.10 This argument takes many forms. In response to the idea that Islam is undergoing something tantamount to the Reformation that swept Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, many Muslims argue that Islam cannot be doing so because there is no Church or priesthood to reform. Certainly there are many historical differences between Islam and Christianity and between early modem Europe and the contemporary Islamic world. 1 1 As even those who most enthusiastically employ the comparison admit, "in the Muslim world today, there is no one central figure or hierarchy of authority against whom the people are rebelling. There are instead many authorities, and, despite numerous claims to the contrary, no movement or individual speaks for all Muslims."12 However, those who dismiss the idea of an emergent Islamic Reformation often wrongly assume there are no real, 10. Compare, for example, similar arguments made by the Islamist thinker Fahmi Huwaydi in al-Islam wa al-dimuqratiyya [Islam and Democracy] (Cairo, 1993), pp. 184-85; and the modernist thinker Muhammad 'Abid al-Jabiri in al-Din wa al-dawla wa tatbiq al- shar'ia (Religion, the State and the Application of Islamic Law) (Beirut, 1996), p. 113. 11. I have argued elsewhere that such comparisons often tend to confuse as much as they reveal: Browers, "Islam and Political Sinn" in An Islamic Reformation ?, pp. 54-78. 12. Eickelman, "Inside the Islamic Reformation," p. 89.</page><page sequence="5">Shahrur's Reformation 449 entrenched forces that currently (and in earlier periods as well) form important objects of reform for liberal Islamic thinkers. Many of Shahrur's writings distinguish between two sides or "tendencies" in the religious debate currently being waged in Islamic societies. The first consists of Arabs and Muslims who support oppressive regimes that hypocritically flaunt slogans of modernity, science and development.13 "Leading this group," according to Sharhur, "have been Marxists, Communists, and some Arab nationalists," who have attempted to "construct a secular state that monopolizes truth" while failing "to fulfill their promise to provide modernity to their societies."14 The second tendency is identified with those who belong to the "Islamic revival" or, alternatively, act as "classicists, traditionalist fundamentalists, and extreme fundamentalists." This group "holds tightly to the literal meaning of the heritage" and believes "that what was fit for the first community of believers in the Prophet's time is fit for all believers in all times." Basing its political thought on "the Caliphate and Imamate," this group maintains that "the state should be controlled either by professional clergy (as in the case of Iran) or by 'ulama (religious scholars).15 As an opposition force against repressive secular regimes, these Islamists remain "hopelessly lost in protest and bargaining over secondary issues such as the Islamic veil, the republication of ancient Islamic texts by the millions, and in perpetrating senseless acts of violence with obscure goals."16 In addition to noting the political failures of both tendencies, Shahrur argues that each lacks a proper political theory. He faults secular modernists with cutting themselves "off from their historical roots and their national affiliation," "disregarding morality itself as a principle for society," and believing "only in materialism as the basis of existence, resulting in the view of human beings as mere statistical units." Islamists, he writes, make the mistakes of transforming "the universal message of Islam into a narrow local one," "giving the traditional, inherited legacy a sacred past," thus turning it into "a dogma that people had to accept and apply literally," and 1 3.

These are the real foci of his reformist project. According to Shahrur, although there is no "Church" in Islam, as the Islamic empire gained power under the Umayyads, there developed a religious class of jurists 0 fuqaha ), vested with authority distinct from the wielders of political authority. Though separate, these jurists tended to remain uncritical of that authority and even sustained it. In return, those holding political power felt no threat from a religious establishment. This development led, in the contemporary context, to a condition where forces represented by various "formal religious establishments" seek "to keep everything as it has been, so as to defend [their] privileges," while extremist fundamentalist forces "try to reclaim the authority of religion for themselves and pry it away from the state."18 Thus, Shahrur's "Reformation" has both hermeneutical and political aims in seeking to overcome the "knowledge oppression" (a/- isibdad al-ma'rifi ) of a "man-made heritage" dominated by a juridical tradition solidified in the early centuries of Islam and the reification of that tradition among various social and political forces. It is from these that contemporary Muslims who attempt to reread the revealed, divine text and make it meaningful for their lives must free themselves.19 As we shall see below, Shahrur's thought challenges three "dogmas" or "orthodoxies" sustained by these forces. Opening the Gates The forces that Shahrur seeks to reform have long been subject to criticism by Muslim reformers. According to Daniel Brown, "since the middle of the nineteenth century, Muslim thinkers have faced numerous and repeated challenges to classical Islamic ideas about religious authority."20 Shahrur is one in a long line of critics who have sought to refute the claim that the "gates of ijtihad" (independent judgment; literally, "self-exertion") had been shut in Islam's early centuries and that later 1 7.

Brown, Rethinking Tradition in Modern Islamic Thought (Cambridge, 1 996), p. 1.</page><page sequence="7">Shahrur's Reformation 451 Muslims need to follow the practice of taqlid, the imitation of established traditions. Calls for "opening the gates" - that is, for practicing ijtihad and rethinking the meaning of the original message - were voiced by reformists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the context of a slow but increasing marginalization of Islamic law in Islamic countries and a general quest for unity to counter the onslaught of European powers. For example, at the turn of the century Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi (Iraq, 1857-1924) declared the "thesis concerning the closing of the gate of ijtihad" put forth by his contemporary - the "miserable," the "ignoramus" Yusuf al-Nabhani (Palestine-Lebanon, 1850-1932) - to be "false and heretical."21 More recently, Subhi Mahmasani (Lebanon, b. 191 1) has written that "the door of ijtihad should be thrown wide open for anyone juristically qualified. The error, all of the error, lies in blind imitation and restraint of thought."22 Although in many respects Shahrur's writings build upon the work of earlier reformers in "opening the gates," others have suggested that Shahrur ranks among those who constitute a "new phenomenon in Islam," what Wael Hallaq terms "religious liberalism." Hallaq distinguishes this from "religious utilitarianism." Both trends, according to him, share the same goal: "the reformulation of legal theory in a manner that brings into successful synthesis the basic religious values of Islam, on the one hand, and a substantive law that is suitable to the needs of a modern and changing society, on the other."23 Both trends seek to pry open the gates of ijtihad. What most divides them are the methods devised to pursue this end. Whereas religious utilitarians place the concept of the public interest ( maslaha ) at the center of their interpretative approach as a sort of guiding principle, Hallaq maintains that religious liberals seek to develop a hermeneutics that departs from traditional literalist interpretations by "understanding revelation as both text and context."24 Specifically, religious liberals are those willing to employ extra-Qur'anic forms of knowledge - in Shahrur's case, linguistic and natural sciences - in interpreting God's revelation. Many reformers over the past two-hundred years have affirmed the ability of Islam to adapt to new circumstances and have constructed various strategies for reviving and renewing the tradition and its continuity 21.

However, Eickelman states that though "some conservative Muslims argue that (Shahrur] underestimates the ability of madrasa-trained religious scholars to adapt their version of authoritative religious learning to new contexts . . . most observers agree that madrasa- trained scholars are losing their audience and former authority."25 Brown suggests that this decline in authority is linked to questions relating to the authority of the Prophetic tradition (surma): Modem controversies over sunna clearly reveal this connection between ideas about the authority of religious texts and rival claims to interpretive authority. For the 'ulama' the defense of the hadith is part of an effort to preserve their own position as interpreters and guardians of hadith, hence the guardians of the whole tradition. In the orthodox structure of religious authority, the Qur'an is viewed through the interpretive filters of both the sunna and the classical tradition. The 'ulama' are the guardians of this interpretive process, and the result is guaranteed through 'ijma' [consensus].26 In developing his unique approach to understanding the Islamic religious heritage, Shahrur's works strike at the traditional authority of such forces. In the process, his work bypasses - though it does not directly deny - two other dogmas of Sunni Islam: the notion of the Qur'an as the uncreated, unmediated word of God and the role of the sunna as an "interpretive filter" for understanding the Qur'an. The Qur'an as Text: Bracketing Mu'tazila Claims Shahrur's first book, in which he outlines his method of studying the Qur'an, al-Kitab wa al-Qur'an [The Book and the Qur'an], points to a differentiation between "two distinct aspects" of the Qur'an upon which his thought is based. Shahrur argues that "the Qur'an is not the whole book, but the parts of it that deal with prophesy. The Shari'a (Islamic law) is the message, which is called 'The Mother of the Book.' The Qur'an and 'The Mother of the Book', prophecy and message, were put together and this is al-kitab (the book)."27 Here, as elsewhere, Shahrur bases his 25. Dale F.

The second [is the message, risala, and ] concerns law and moral behavior. In this sense, the first aspect is objective and thus independent of human acceptance. The second aspect is subjective, depending on human knowledge, as, for example, in the human capacity to know right from wrong.29 In his role as prophet ( nabi ), according to Shahrur, Muhammad received religious information regarding prophecy and, as a messenger ( rasul ), he received legal instructions. Since prophecy is expressed in ambiguous speech, interpretation ( ta'wil ) may vaiy based on different perceptions of different verses. But only Muhammad's message, which, though univocal, is expressed in language that will yield particular legal effects within particular temporal and spatial contexts, is subject to ijtihad.30 By distinguishing between prophecy and message and interpretation and ijtihad, Shahrur is able to further distinguish between the objective and inevitable prophecy, which cannot be challenged, and the message of how to live a moral life, in relation to which human beings maintain a free will and must exercise individual judgment. Shahrur's distinction, and the effect it has in asserting human agency and the importance of independent, individual reasoning, bears upon another central question in Islam: whether the Qur'an is the eternal, exact Word of God (the accepted dogma in Sunni Islam) or a created action, God's Word put into human language. This debate dates back to at least the late eighth century, when those who believed the Qur'an was the "uncreated" Word of God stood against those who believed it was created in time, like anything that is not God himself. The latter view was most closely associated with the Mu'tazila school, which provided the state creed for a brief time under the 'Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (d. 833).31 28. Shahrur has studied modern linguistics with the Syrian linguist, Ja'far Dik al-Bab, who wrote the preface and contributed a concluding section on "Asrar al-lisan al-'arabi" (Secrets of the Arabic Language) to Shahrur's al-Kitab wa al-Qur'art. 29. Shahrur, "Divine Text," p. 4. 30. Shahrur, al-Kitab wa al-Qur'an, p. 37. 31. The Mu'tazili view was opposed by the theologians Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d. 855) and Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 925), as well as their followers. These scholars maintained "that the eternal Qur'an was not so much the physical text in the form of a script, but rather an 'inner speech' ( al-kalam al-nafsi ), an indivisible mental act of God." (Ebrahim Moosa,</page><page sequence="10">454 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques Although Shahrur mentions the Mu'tazila as one of the competing groups in existence when "the Caliphs and the official Ulema attempted to impose a singular official meaning of Islam which was derived under the influence of circumstantial settings,"32 he never places himself within its tradition, nor does he claim to be reviving the debates that surrounded it. However, the "reading" in which Shahrur is engaged involves treating different parts of the book differently, that is, according to different textual methods. The distinctive nature of the different parts of the revelation is the basis of his hermeneutics. According to Shahrur, the book {al-kitab) contains both mutashabih (similar, as in similar to the divine) verses, which are figurative and allegorical, and muhkam (prescribed) verses, which are clear.33 These two types of verses correspond to the Qur'an (prophecy) and Umm al-Kitab (message) respectively.34 The mutashibih, which constitute the largest part of the book, consist of facts (haqq). These are articulated through verses that remain ambiguous and can lead to multiple interpretations. In contrast, the muhkam, although clear, cannot be themselves subject to interpretation; they provide the limits within which interpretive dialogue is to be conducted and can yield different legal practices according to social and economic conditions, and the cultural practices of a time and place. Among the few studies in English that discuss his work, one finds some disagreement over whether Shahrur aims at interpretation ( ta'wil ), exegesis (tafsir ), or "merely" a "reading" ( qira'a ) based on ijtihad of what "Introduction" to Fazlur Rahman, Revival and Reform in Islam: A Study of Islamic Fundamentalism [Oxford, 2000], p. 12). Although this view agreed with the Mu'tazila understanding of the material Qur'an rendered in Arabic as created, whereas the Mu'tazilas maintained this necessitated the employment of human reason to give a coherent account of the Islamic belief, the Ash'aris held that the Qur'an was similar (tashbih) to an eternal and uncreated divine speech, and thus revelation, not reason, provided the sole source of belief. According to the Ash'aris, "the only interpretation permitted was an intra-textual one by which the entire revelation acquired coherence and consistency." (Moosa, "Introduction," p. 13). In 848 the caliph al-Mutawakkil reversed a edict put in place by al-Ma'mun that required officials to publicly profess that the Qur'an was the created Word of God and began to place restrictions against the Mu'tazilas and their teachings. Over time the influence of the Mu'tazila school gradually waned and the Ash'ari doctrine transformed into an assertion of the "inimitability" ( i'jaz ) of the Qur'an. This doctrine has constituted Muslim orthodoxy ever since. 32.

Shahrur, al-Kitab wa al-Qur'an , pp. 103-1 1. 34. Shahrur also identifies a third type of verse, which he refers to as " tafsil " (or tafsil al- kitab , explanations of the book). Tafsil verses are neither to be accepted as fact nor treated as law, but are provided by God so we understand how to interpret the book. These verses are few and can easily be identified by their direct references to the book. Ibid., pp. 113-21.</page><page sequence="11">Shahrur's Reformation 455 each of these terms mean. For example, Sahiron Syamsuddin attributes to Shahrur an "inner-Quranic exegetical method" while denying that he is engaged in hermeneutics of any kind.35 However, Eickelman argues that "Shahrur's ideas directly challenge the authority of traditional Qur'anic exegesis ( tafsir )" and points to his use of "qira'a" in his title (which, according to Eickelman, "can mean either reading or interpretation"), rather than "tafsir" as indicating that "Shahrur advocates a decisive break."36 More likely, I think, Shahrur's use of " qira'a " makes reference to the various forms of recitation ( qira'at ) in the Islamic tradition in order to justify some of the linguistic variants that his thought relies upon. Further, as Hallaq rightly notes, although Shahrur claims his work is "no more than a 'contemporary reading' of the Quran" and is "in no way an exegetical or a legal work," what is significant is Shahrur's distinction between the interpretation ( ta'wil ) appropriate for approaching the information Muhammad received regarding prophecy, religion and the laws of the universe, and the reasoning ( ijtihad ) to which one can subject the corpus of legal instructions that Muhammad received.37 Ta'wil suggests a hermeneutical method adopted by the Mu'tazilites in order to escape the anthropomorphism of a literal reading of such Qur'anic passages as "the hand of God" (which would be interpreted figuratively as "the power of God"). Interestingly, although Shahrur seems to concede the appropriateness of the Mu'tazila approach for dealing with prophetic verses, he claims "only God" knows the truth regarding such matters, and shifts his focus to the legal verses and the need for ijtihad. The Qur'an in Context: Toward an Unmediated Reading A third dogma addressed by Shahrur has its origins in the jurisprudential theory associated with Muhammad Ibn Idris Shafi'i (d. 820), 38 and this concerns one of the fundamental tenets of Islam: that Muslims are 35.

According to Brown, after al-Shafi'i, the Prophetic Sunna rose to even greater ascendancy, leading to such maxims as: "The sunna rules on the Qur'an, but the Qur'an does not rule on the sunna," and "the Qur'an has greater need of the sunna than the sunna of the Qur'an."39 In justification it was argued that the Qur'an contains the outlines of Islam while the details and proper application of those outlines remained with the Prophet Muhammad to expound upon. Shahrur addresses this issue in his call for Muslims to read the text "as if Muhammad had passed away yesterday. "40 He intends this appeal to affirm the timelessness of the Qur'an. Yet he also asserts that contemporary readers should reject the intermediary role of traditional Qur'anic scholarship in order to undertake a rereading of the scripture "freed from all historic additions that were added arbitrarily by authoritarian or sultanic governors."4' In regard to the rulings of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) in particular, Shahrur argues that the lack of disagreement among the jurists, together with the stamp of the society in which these rulings were made, render them inappropriate for contemporary Islam.42 Although Shahrur acknowledges the exemplary life of the Prophet, he maintains that Muhammad is a model only in the sense that he lived according to God's message, and "not in the sense that we must make the same choices that he made. The life of the Prophet is the first historical variant of how the rules of Islam can be applied to a tribal society of the time. But it is the first variant, not the only one or the last one."43 According to Shahrur, "Islam embodies the capacity to evolve through legislation and morality."44 This means that not only the sayings and actions of the Prophet, but also of the first community of believers, held by most Muslims as constitutive of the ideal community, are tangential to a contemporary 39.

Just as the Prophet Muhammad and his contemporaries focused on the received revelation in the light of their intellectual capacities and world views, so should present day Muslims concentrate on the text in light of their period. Moreover, each generation is not only situated to better understand the Qur'an than its predecessors, but - in Shahrur's view - it is better equipped in light of the advancement of knowledge.45 Shahrur's project is based largely upon a belief that Muslims can return to a direct reading of the text, unmediated by any previous exegesis or interpretation. So, too, Shahrur remains unconcerned with the context of the revelation's initial reception and compilation. The most important context for interpreting the Qur'an is, in his view, the current political and intellectual context of the umma, and the only limits on interpretation within that context are provided by (the language of) the text itself. Many reformists prior to Shahrur took aim at the primary position given to the Usui al-fiqh, the traditional 'ulama, and the sunna in interpreting God's revelation. Muhammad 'Abduh (Egypt, 1849-1917) expressed an opinion very close to Shahrur's in arguing that "it is not permissible ... to apply the law of one group of people to another group who differ from and surpass the first in level of understanding, because the law will not suit their state of thinking and will not match their customs and traditional habits."46 Sayyid Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (Iran, d. 1879) spared no works in declaring the 'ulama of his day to be "like a very narrow wick, on top of which is a very small flame that neither lights its surroundings nor gives light to others."47 For his part, Brown cites al-Shafi'i's reference to opponents who argued that the Qur'an "explains everything" as an indication of the long history of that view.48 According to him, the question of the relationship between the Qur'an and sunna was revived in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of thinkers such as Sayyid Ahmad Khan (d. 1898). Brown writes, for example, that Ahmad Khan assumed, "throughout his work, that the Qur'an stands on its own, requiring only the application of a dedicated and enlightened mind for its understanding."49 Shahrur never makes reference to or places himself in the Qur'an-only tradition, but it seems clear that his position goes beyond 45.

Reformation in a New Public Sphere The result of Shahrur's challenge to orthodoxy is the placing of interpretive authority directly in the hands of the living umma. As an alternative to both modernist secularist and traditional Islamic tendencies, Shahrur identifies with those who "have called for a return to al-tanzil, the original text of God's revelation to the Prophet."50 The sort of direct return, or "contemporary rereading," that Shahrur calls for involves bypassing religious authorities, past and present. Further, the form of the "reading" he has in mind involves an open and pluralistic debate among Muslims; that is, Shahrur seeks the formation of a public sphere similar to that theorized by Jiirgen Habermas: a space within which public judgments can be formed through argument.51 This understanding of the public sphere is embodied in such conversations as those taking place via the International Forum for Islamic Dialogue (IFID), a nonprofit organization founded in 1 994 and based in London.52 The IFID publishes a newsletter in English and Arabic, entitled Islam21, and provides an interactive website for exchanging and developing ideas among Muslims. The IFID explicitly sees itself as occupying and developing a new realm in a period witnessing "the advancement of civil society and the retreat of state control." Its members distinguish their dialogue from earlier Islamic movements, which, in their view "were chasing state power," a strategy that the Forum's organizers describe as not only "very costly and rarely achievable, " but also as unlikely 50. Shahrur, "Divine Text," p. 4. 5 1 . Jiirgen Habermas, Between Facts and Norms: Contributions to a Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy (Cambridge, MA, 1996). 52. There are a number of such forums. In addition to these forums, some research institutes in the region discuss the ideas of Shahrur and other reformers. See, for example, the book that came out of Shahrur's visit to Morocco: al-Ma'rifa al-'aqliyah, al-falsafah al- Islamiyah al-mu'asirah wa ma'na al-iman al-dini fi al-Islam [Rational Knowledge, Contemporary Islamic Philosophy and the Meaning of Religious Faith in Islam] (Sale, 1998).

Recapturing a Reading Public One of the central tasks faced by Shahrur and others involved in the IFID lies in reclaiming the right of the "layperson" to (re)read, deliberate and legislate, based on the fundamentals of Islam. Many of those who argue against such a broad and open model of deliberation do so by asserting that this task is premised upon the modem notion of democracy, which places ultimate authority in the hands of the people. According to the common, traditional Muslim view, this is a mistake, since democracy usurps the sovereignty ( al-hakimiyya ) rightly belonging to God alone. The 53.

According to this view a jahili society is one that builds upon the foundations of al- hakimiyya al-bashariya (human sovereignty).57 According to Abdelwahab El-Affendi, another prominent scholar affiliated with the IFID, the Islamist view is based upon the belief that "Muslims are incapable of living according to God's will unless a dictatorial ruler imposes on them this conduct." This would establish a state "made of one virtuous ruler and a whole load of hypocrites who only obey Shari'a because they are slaves."58 Shahrur similarly argues that the traditional Islamic view of politics grants authority to a single viceregent, a Caliph, who rules on behalf of God, whereas "God has selected [all of] humankind for viceregency ( khilafa )."59 El-Affendi echoes this view by stating that "the sovereignty of one man contradicts the sovereignty of God, for all men are equal in front of God."60 El-Affendi maintains that the Islamist understanding of politics is not only contrary to reason and Islam rightly understood, but also to the reality of Muslims today who must "keep Islam alive" while living under tyrannical and corrupt rulers. Similarly, Shahrur maintains that among "traditional jurists," freedom has been reduced to "exemption from bondage." For their part, Shahrur and El-Affendi view sovereignty as belonging to God but delegated to mankind in the form of human agency. According to Muqtedar Khan, another contributor to the Islam21 forum, "Muslims as individuals and as an Ummah cannot be held accountable for what they do unless they have the freedom/agency/ sovereignty to do as they please"; Islam is best served when governments are accountable and responsible to their citizens.61 57. See Abu'l A'la al-Maududi, The Process of Islamic Revolution (Lahore, 1980). Muqtedar Khan notes how "The rise of political Islam has made the concept of Islamic sovereignty central to Islamic political theory, and it is often presented as a barrier to any form of democracy. Democracies are seen as systems in which human whim is the source of law, whereas Islamic principles are transcendental and cannot be undermined by popular will." M. A.

With the exception of a small study circle in Damascus composed mostly of engineers, Shahrur's primary means of communication is the book, an unadorned means of persuasion that appeals to a growing educated middle class and continues to represent the pinnacle of knowledge to others."62 Shahrur, however, wishes to place that persuasion within limits set by God. Here, too, his argument relies upon a linguistic approach to delineate various meanings of the words found in the Qur'an. It is on this basis that he distinguishes between that which is "divinely sanctioned ( halal ) and the divinely prohibited ( haram ) and the humanly forbidden ( mamnu ')," maintaining that "the basic tenet of Islam is that everything not specifically prohibited is permitted." Further, he claims that "the only authority for divine prohibitions (tahrirn) is God"; that is, neither the Prophet Muhammad nor any other human being may "make lawful the divinely forbidden or forbid the divinely sanctioned."63 However, an existing Islamic community is free to make allowances based on God's message. In order to understand how Muslims are to be guided in their regulation of that which falls outside of the realm of the divinely forbidden - the legal message of the Qur'an - Shahrur applies knowledge gained from engineering and the sciences to cast light on his linguistic analysis. Examining the Qur'anic verses containing the words "curvature" C hanifiyya ) and "straightness" 0 istiqama ), he argues that the two are not so much intended as opposites, but as two paths coexisting in an important relation to one another. Istiqama means following a straight path, whereas hanafiyya means deviating from it. Shahrur locates curvature in the material world where the laws of physics confirm that all things move in curves. Straightness is not a quality of the natural world, but can only be divinely ordained. Human beings exist within curvature, yet look to God to guide them along "the right path" ( Qur'an 1 :5).M 62.

Ibid., p. 439.</page><page sequence="18">462 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques Shahrur identifies the straightness that God provides human beings as they move within curvature through his "Theory of God's Limits."65 Rather than viewing, for example, punishments prescribed in the Qur'an as absolutes, his analysis of the language used to describe those punishments allows him to distinguish among different forms God's commands taken as guides or limits to human action. Human legislation is permitted in the space between the limits ( hudud) that the "Book" sets for all human actions and natural phenomena. Shahrur distinguishes at least six different types of limits: 1) where the lower limits stand alone, prescribing, for example, the minimum punishment for a given offense; 2) where the upper limits stand alone, setting the maximum penalty; 3) where the lower and upper limits are conjoined; 4) where the upper and lower limits meet together; 5) where the curvature moves between the lower and upper limits but touches neither; and 6) where the curvature moves between a positive upper limit and a negative lower limit.66 Shahrur maintains that the various punishments specified in the Qur'an represent the upper limit for a given offense, and not prescribed penalties: "For example, the execution of [a] murderer is the upper limit of punishment for murder, and nobody can exceed it. But if anyone wants to give a lower punishment, it is perfectly acceptable." Further, "as there are upper limits in the Qur'an, there are also lower limits in it, for example, incest is a lower limit of marriage rules."67 According to Shahrur, only one crime, adultery (which is punishable by 100 lashes), is absolutely set as regards the severity of punishment. Women's dress exists within the broad curvature between 65. Shahrur's account of how he formulated this theory is telling of his method of combining modem science and linguistics in an analysis of the Qur'an: "One day an idea occurred to me when I was lecturing at the university of civil engineering. I was talking about how to make compaction roads. We have what we call a proctor test, in which we sample and test soil used in fills in embankments. In this test, we exclude and interpolate. We have x and y. A hyperbole. We have a basic risk. We plot a curve and put a line on the top of it. This line is the upper limit. Then I thought of the concept of 'God's limits' {hudud Utah). I returned here to the office and opened the Qur'an. Just as in mathematics we have five ways of representing limits, I found five cases in which the notion of God's limits occurred. What they have in common is the idea that God has not set down the exact rules of conduct, but only the limits within which societies can create their own rules and laws. I have written about ideas of integrity ( al-istiqama ) and universal moral or ethical codes. The idea was at first only a footnote in my last chapter, but I saw that it applied to my main argument, so I corrected everything that I wrote about hudud iliah in the book in order to be consistent. Then I considered my argument to be sound." Quoted in Eickelman, "Islamic Religious Commentary and Lesson Circles," p. 143. 66. Shahrur, al-Kitab wa al-Qur'an , pp. 453-64.

Within these limits human societies are not only free, but obligated, to develop and adapt their legislation according to the conventions and socio-political circumstances of the time. Shahrur sees his theory of God's Limits as revealing the modern meanings of a number of Islamic concepts. This holds true, for example, for what he views as a core Qur'anic principle: shura (consultation). Consultation is needed to work out the legislative questions for a modem polity within the limits set by God; and the outcome of that process will need to be relative to the particular curves - the particular social, economic and political circumstances - of each community. Shahrur's own political convictions are clearly revealed when he concludes that "in our time, genuine shura means genuine pluralism of points of view, and democracy."68 Interestingly, Shahrur completely dispenses with the traditional notion of consensus (ijma'), which has guided Islamic notions of decision-making and governance.69 Rather, the necessary "ethic" for sustaining a democratic and pluralist public sphere is that of ibaha, which Shahrur understands as embodying openness and freedom. The Limits of Dialogue: The Reception of Muhammad Shahrur Although the democratization of interpretive and political authority may be appealing to some Muslims, it clearly comes at a cost for traditional bases and sources of power, and it involves a number of positions considered highly controversial by many others. For example, various movements and thinkers who have argued that Islam should be based first and foremost on the Qur'an and have denied priority to - and, in some cases, even a role for - the sunna have been marginalized, banned, persecuted and/or deemed heretical.70 Although Shahrur does not deny the 68. Shahrur, "Divine Text," p. 8. In his 1994 work Shahrur notes that "a particular concept of democracy was mentioned in the holy revelation, which is "al-shura."

One should also mention the Pakistani thinker and</page><page sequence="20">464 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques authenticity of the sunna - in fact he draws upon it extensively in outlining and illustrating his theory of limits - he does contextualize it. In Shahrur's words, "a restriction on the otherwise unrestricted 0 al-mutlaq ), which applies a circumstantial attribute (sifa zarfiyya), is not a (categorical] prohibition (tahrim )."7' Thus, the sunna provides an exemplar of Islamic law, but it is neither the only model nor necessarily the one that contemporary Muslims should draw upon in legislating for their own society. In regard to those who criticize him, Shahrur reports in his second book that he is faced with two choices - either reply to his critics one by one, or devote himself to further developing his theory. He has opted for the latter.72 Thus, he deals with his critics in a general sense. According to Shahrur, the common denominator among all those who criticize his work is a problem of reference or authority ( mushkila al-marji'iya). He claims that his critics are at variance with one another, except on one point: they consider the Islamic heritage much as their pious ancestors ( salaf ), and that Muslims must conform to it without question. Shahrur, in contrast, sees the sunna as a matter of discussion.73 According to the Algerian Islamic thinker Muhammad Arkoun, at least part of Shahrur's appeal is his use of modem language and sciences to reassert the truth of Islam in the face of modernity: Muslim scientists who specialize in the practical sciences are easily able to write best sellers showing that the Qur'an clearly foresaw all the scientific discoveries made in Europe by savants, from Galileo and Kepler to the present day! . . .

Similarly, the important Iranian scholar of modem Shi'ism, Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i (1 903-83) denied the authenticity of Hadith as a whole in his book, The Quran in Islam (Tehran, 1 984). Although there are many differences in views and significance of these thinkers and movements, all prioritized the Qur'an to varying extents and have suffered persecution. 71 .

Interestingly, one critic Shahrur spares from this generalization is the controversial Egyptian thinker Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd. For Abu Zayd Shahrur is among those who have intentionally sacrificed "scientific analysis" to "pragmatism," thus avoiding the sort of persecution to which he himself has been subjected.

Revelation is not questioned or analysed, but is once again re- assessed for Muslims whose faith might be shaken by modem scientific thought.74 In a somewhat different way the Syrian writer Sadiq Jalal al-'Azm attributes Shahrur's appeal to the fact that his thought suits modernity. Al-'Azm notes that Shahrur's books are widely read by the Syrian middle class because they reinterpret Islam in a way that allows individuals to engage in modem business practices and remain good Muslims at heart.75 Al-'Azm suggests that Shahrur's limits - especially his contention that what is not explicitly forbidden (hararri) is permitted ( halaQ - constricts the realms of life regulated by the dictates of religion while expanding those realms in which humans are allowed to act, legislate, interact, buy and sell, in freedom. Clearly, however, Shahrur would see the life of a Muslim as infused with an Islamic ethos in all realms. Conclusion: Shahrur's Reformation is a "New Islamization" of the Public Sphere According to Shahrur, "Islam is a covenant between God and the whole of humanity." Shahrur defines a covenant as a "charter or an agreement which regulates the conditions of a relationship between two parties," tying them together through "necessity and obligation." He distinguishes a covenant from a "contract," which he views as merely a "capitulation" to God, "the more powerful partner." This is the relationship that Shahrur maintains has been "distorted and badly explained in heritage literature ( turath ) and by those traditional jurists ( fuqaha ) who were closed to the participation of the laity and satisfied with reductive notions of freedom." In contrast, the covenant is based on a "trust which stems from a conscious will, which believes in Him and submits to His orders and prohibitions."76 Shahrur maintains that Islam is embodied in the Holy Book and, as such, is "divine and eternal." However, what he refers to as "Islamization" 74. Mohammed Arkoun, The Unthought in Contemporary Islamic Thought (London, 2002), pp. 68-69. 75. Interview with author, Damascus, Syria (27 January 1998). 76. Shahrur, "Proposal for an Islamic Covenant.</page><page sequence="22">466 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques is a "human activity" that "impersonates Islam" and, as such, "is bounded by history and geography." As a result, while "there is no need for a new Islam," Shahrur does call for a "new Islamization" - that is, a contemporary reading of the Holy Book in order to construct jurisprudence and legislation for contemporary life.77 In light of Shahrur's call for a "new Islamization," I think it a mistake to view his writings as "stating the secular case for Islam."78 H.E. Chehabi observes that the question of "whether an Islamic state precedes an Islamic society or vice versa" has long divided Muslim scholars. "Must the state impose Islamic norms so as to create an Islamic society, or will a society made up of pious and observant Muslims nolens volens beget an Islamic state"? Chehabi further notes the "political strategy" corresponding to each perspective: "conquest of power in the first case, conquest of souls in the second."79 Shahrur's approach to Islam and politics articulates the latter view: Since religion has an important normative role in the Middle East societies, it is impossible to ignore it. Liberals tried to do so, and they failed in their attempt to transport Western political formula to the Arab/Muslim states. Marxists wanted to impose a secularization, to deconstruct religion, and also failed. Anyhow, there could be secularism in the Arab or Islamic states, but it would not solve anything. The Middle East problem is not secularism, but democracy. The secular state has been there for seventy years, it was imposed upon society and it did not work. A religious state was created in Iran and it is the strongest state in the Middle East, because it emerged from religion and appealed to the culture of the people among whom it appeared.80 Thus, I think it is more accurate to characterize Shahrur's effort as aimed at reformulating Islamic jurisprudence and at reconstructing a universal Islamist consciousness, not at separating religion from the political realm (legally or ideologically). In fact, the contributors to the International Forum for Islamic Democracy suggest that whereas those 77. Shahrur, Dirasat islamiyyat , p. 235; "Applying the Concept of 'Limits'," p. 9. 78.

For example, Luther remained concerned with the "invisible church's" worldly independence in relation to teaching, but was even more concerned that the church not meddle in politics (though he thought it proper that the state organize the external aspects of the Church, such as its property). Calvin viewed both Church and state as concerned with external morality, but as proceeding in different ways appropriate to their different natures. As a result, he maintained that Church and state should collaborate as "separate but equal" servants of God to establish Christian/civil virtue. To the extent that there is a lack of institutionalization of the "church" in Islam, such separations are deemed unnecessary. And again, Shahrur is able to maintain a small, but important distinction that separates his thought from more radical conclusions. Yet, as history has shown time and again, often what comes as a result of thought or action does so by going beyond the intentions of the actor or doer. As Max Weber noted: "the cultural consequences of the [ Protestant] Reformation were to a great extent . . . unforeseen and even unwished-for results of the labors of the reformers. They were often far removed from or even in contradiction to all that they themselves thought to attain."82 Whether the reformist ideas of Shahrur and others give birth to a Reformation remains to be seen. 81.
