<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE METAMORPHOSIS OF USAS BY K. M. Shembavnekar, M. A. The disappearance of Usas from the Vedic pantheon is as my- sterious as her presence interesting. It is all the more inexplicable as we remember the amount of poetic wealth 8pent on the enchant- ing Daughter of Heaven by the Vedic Rsis who handle the theme of her rise and duration with a reverence and love that belong only to the earliest poets, or rather prophets, of mankind. But though the final exit of the charming goddess is generally regretted, its cause is, as yet, scarcely properly investigated. The universal law of Change, it is true, is the general answer to the too inquisitive questioner in all matters relating to antiquity, but still a momentous change is always worthy of our investigation. For the loss of an old order or thing, if viewed in the scientific perspective, is brought about in two ways: either by metamor- phosis, in which the old disappears only to emerge as new ; or by supersession, in which the old is pushed aside by a stronger new rival. The object of the present article is to prove that Usas has changed in the former sense, though the evolution is not even so much as suspected, first, because of the dimness of the inter- mediate stages, and secondly by reason of the great development in her new character. When, however, the progressive stages which transformed the Vedic Usas into LaksmI of later mythology be- come luminmis, it will be easily conceded that Theology also pre- sents instances of metamorphosis as strange or remarkable as Zoology, and as attractive as any that either Ovid or Dante dep- icts in poetry. It never seems to have struck any writer on Indian mythology that though the goddess Sri (the goddess of splendour and wealth) is the same as LaksmI according to all later accounts, yet in her earlier phase she possesses certain attributes which clearly argue a period of transition. Some of them disclose her identity with Usas, while others are of a novel type. This is, of course, the intermed- iate stage wherein the old traits appear oddly blended with the 5 [ Annals, B. O, K. I, ]</page><page sequence="2">35^ Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute new, quite in conformity with the change of time. For the period which marked the close of the TJgvedic epoch was a period of transition in many respects. The old gods, severing their con- nection with the phenomena of Nature, were assuming a more and more anthropomorphic shape, and also a more exalted chara- cter as becomes the epic gods. The Rgvedic words, at first so strikingly cognate to th&amp; root-meaning in their import, now be- come gradually settled in their conventional senses. And the school of the ' Aitihäsikas 7 - the gleaners of old legends and my- ths - was busy weaving them into wondrous poetic tales. But in spite of this general change in theology, Indra, Varuna and the other gods have not lost their old appellations which are the most unmistakable signs of recognition. Such is not, however, the case with Usas. The Dawn, the natural phenomenon, slowly lost her divinity, but her radiance which is the V6ry essence of her life and form came to be deified and venerated as Sri. Why this latter goddess is not even mentioned in the JRgveda , it is now easy to understand. It is in the famous 'SrI-Sükta ' which is a 'Khila Sükta'of that Veda, and undoubtedly the oldest of that class, that we see her for the first time. In this early conception of the new deity we perceive a good many attributes that usually ch- aracterise the lustre of the dawn. And that settles the question of identity notwithstanding the métonymie change. Thus, if the rays of TJsas are said to be 4 Candra ' (delightful) in the R.V.,1 Sri herself is described as ť Candra 7 in the èrï-SUkta. 2 Both are golden in complexion, and both shower the same gifts on the sup- pliant devotees, namely, cows, chariots, horses, heroic sons etc.3 The epithet 1 Pingalã ? (the Rosy) as applied to Sri in the Sukta , is intelligible only when we view her in the light of this identification. Similarly, why Sri or LaksmI is described as clad in milk-white 4 garments, and fond of white flowers and decoration, will be clear if we remember that the original Vedic goddess is said to be 1 cf. ^tsr 3tí m fit hrîtt i v- T- 48~9 BÇm ^Tïrï^ï ÏWÏ?

It is necessary to remark in this connection that in later times Laksmi has not re- tained any such clear mark of wetness after she landed on the dry ground leaving her watery home. Next, the faot that 1 Jâta vedas' or Agni is implored in the Šri-SUkta to bring in Laksmi, fumi" shes the most unequivocal clue to regard Sri as identical with Usas. For the close relation of the two divinities in the Rgveda is a patent fact, while in the Sükta it is only a sort of reminisc- ence. s Again, the sisterhood between * A-Laksml ' ( Poverty, Distress), and Laksmi may fairly be traced back to the times when the dark night was sincerely looked upon as the elder sister of the bright Dawn. * Lastly, the epithet ' gandha-dvãrã ' ( unfolder of fragrance ), as belonging to Sri suggests the aromatic dawn, while her association with the day-lotuses ( padmas ) which bloom at day-break confirms it. All this is again highly corroborated by the history of the evolution, which, when properly traced, is as interesting as the result, and makes certain moot points in the life of the Vedic goddess very luminous. It is expressly stated in the Visqu and other Purãym that the churning of the Ocean was occasioned by the disappearance of Sri into it owing to the ourse of Durväsas, and that she was known to be the daughter of Bhrgu in her previous existence. Now, who is Bhrgu ? The Bhrgus, indeed, figure in the Bgveãa as a clan of mighty Rsis, like the Aňgirasas and the Atharvans, but none of them individually receives the distinction of spacial mention. It is only in the Taittiriya-Upanisad 1 3«r: ipJT W(%TI I v- L 48' 14¡ W5ISÌ fàírâi I VIL 77' 2- 53=53^ fífà: W5RTOU I L 113- 7 2 3Tlif[ etc- Srï-Sukta qé i v- L 48"6- 3 ai n stra? çsçnfaïmifiTîfrç 1 Srî s- cf- R- v- l- ni- 1 4 ÇïtfÎ ^ ^ V* 111 i 55&gt; 11 wNwrër *TÌR«TTC^ I 1. 124, 1</page><page sequence="4">3S4 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute that we meet with a mythological personality of that name for the first time. But then, it should be observed, he is there said to be the son of Varuna1 and none of the members of the ßsi-clan. When we remember that 4 Bhrgu ' even in Classical Sanskrit, means a 4 precipice the mystery surrounding the mythical being is at once unravelled. He is either the rising mountain, or the 4 Lokäloka ' - the chain of mountain that seems to encircle the earth. Viewed in this light, his paternal relation to Varuna ( the Lord of the sky ) becomes manifest. Again, Venus, the planet, is also called Bhrgu 's son ( Bhärgava ), as we may n,w believe, because of his keeping close to the horizon throughout. Thus proximity or close succession was sufficient for the Vedic or post-Vedic poets to establish some kind of family connection between a pair of natural objects or phenomena, Sri, the daughter of Bhrgu2 ( BhãrgavI ) and the sister of the Morning star, can, therefore, be none other than Usas who invariably clings to the rising mountain, like a young maiden to her father's side. How she disappeared into the ocean has been already referred to above. But the legend preserved in the Vístjlu and some other Purãnas seems to be the poetic version of an old Usas myth which may be traced in the ßgyeda. The reader of Usas hymns is startled, indeed, when he sees the mighty god Indra chastising the terrified celestial maiden-smashing her car in splinters, and chasing her to a great distance through the aerial space.3 And yet, the enormity of the crime for which she is so mercilessly dealt with is scarcely proclaimed. We are simply told that the offending goddess was a 4 durhanãyu ' i. e. ť a goer on the wrong track ( if 4 han ' means to 4 go 9 according to the Grammarians ' maxim îr ÇrFq-sroj *T?ir$rP ) ; or, 4 desirous of killing Indra ' ( if 4 han ' means to 4 kill ' ). All Vedic scholars, so far as I know, have been at a loss to understand the exact motive or -magnitude of Usas' guilt. Even the great scholiast, Sãyana, contents himself only with the paraphrase of the words, where we want an explana- tion of the myth. Now as a natural phenomenon this is intelli- 1 Tait. U. III. 2.

Her crime is, probably, nothing more than lingering a little longer even after sunrise on a cloudy day. But however we may explain the phenomenon, its mythological importance can never be overrated. For this is the very myth which is referred to, though in a slightly altered form, in the Rãmãya Tia^ and which later on developed into the grand puranic legend of the Churning of the Ocean. The reference in the Rãmãyaria is clearly to the earlier version of the exploit of the Vedic war-god against the gentle Usas. When young Rama, in obedience to the dictates of con- science and the universal law of chivalry, hesitated to kill the wicked Tãdakã at the bidding of Visvãmitra, the latter justifies the killing of a woman, provided it is beneficial to mankind ; and as an instance he cites god Visnu's killing Bhrgu's wife, who thought of ridding the world of Indra.1 Here we find Visnu, the guardian of the world, taking the place of Indra and shielding him from all intrigues and mishaps, while the intriguer is the wife of Bhrgu. Thus it is evident that Vâlmïki had the legend from some older source-perhaps an old Brãhmana or gäthä now lost - or, perhaps, from some other source than that of the Purãnas, wherein Usas figured as the wife of Bhrgu instead of his daughter. But the difference is trivial when we remember that the change in the import of the word 4 patní ' which, in early Vedic times meant simply a ť protectress 9 or 'governess' is of subsequent date, and that a corresponding change in mythological outlook was but a foregone conclusion. The legend in the Rãmãyana , therefore, proves, first, that the wife of Bhrgu is none other than Usas ; and, secondly, that, notwithstanding certain minor differ- ences, the various versions about the disappearance of that god- dess are based on the same Vedic myth. And lastly, we behold her once more, rising from the Ocean when it was churned by the gods and demons. The episode of the 4 Churning of the Ocean' is not only the oldest legend in the epics and the Purãnas, but also the grandest and boldest that could be conceived by a poeťs fancy. The Visnu Purana unquestionably presents the older version of the story when it says that the divine » - - - , - » 1 3.1 ÏW ^tTFÌT I H^řlJ H Rãm. I 25, 22</page><page sequence="6">35¿&gt; Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute enterprise was for the recovery of the lost Sri. The epics, on the other hand, unanimously declare that the chief aim of the gods and demons in that undertaking - perilous even for them- was the acquisition of the Immortal Drink (Amrta). And though they de- scribe the appearance of Sri or Laksmi in glowing words, they do not connect the event with anything like her past history. Ac- cording to the Puranic account» the reappearance of Sri is an event of far greater moment for the gods than the gain of the 4 Amrta ' as their hearty reception of the goddess followed by an outburst of spontaneous hymn clearly testifies. But this reincarnation of the goddess, and, indeed the whole story of the churning of the Ocean becomes intelligible enough, when we remember that the grand conception underlying it originated with the change in the import of the word 4 Samudra' at the close of the Vedic period, and that the post- Vedic poet or poets were capable of preserving the old myths by giving them a new lease of life. It is clear to anyone tolerably acquainted with the Rgveda that the word * Samudra 9 denotes there the mid-air-region 1 ( antariksa ) as well as the terrestrial sea. However, in course of time, like many other Rgvedic words, it became restricted in its import, and stood for one object only. If, therefore, the dau- ghter of Bhrgu, who, as we have already řeen, is none other than Usas, vanishes into, and emerges again from, the 4 Samudra ' it is a change in the theological outlook rather than in the natural phenomenon-a change in the import of word and not in fact. It is not necessary for our purpose to trace here the previous his- tory of the other 4 gems ', though, on a closer examination, that also may be found, at least in part, to conform to the same mode of explanation as above. 2 The whole episode of 4 Samudra-Man- 1 Compare, for instance, gquj; g etc» R- V.

And the desire-yielding cows ( )who rose up from the ocean at the same time can be no other than the whose abode Í3 ' antariksa 7, and who manifests herself in the sweet and pure utterances of the wise. That sweet words serve the purpose of man io the highest dôgreô was admitted in early Vedic times and hence 'speech', was said to be a bounteous cow; Compare.

And our only misfortune is that the names of those gifted sons of the Muse who left a rich and considerable heritage to the authors of the Epic and the present Purãnas should have been so easily con- signed to oblivion. And, lastly, Laksmťs union with Visnu amply bears out her Vedic origin and character as traced above by us. That Visnu is the sun at the meridian is a conclusion of Yäska who identifies all the Ädityas with the solar deity. When, there- fore, we behold the goddess taking refuge with Visnu, the most high and popular of later mythology, we but realise what is anticipated in the Rgveda , where the morning sun is described as chasing Usas-the rosy dawn-like a man who pursues a youthful maiden. As the worthy consort of the chief of the Hindu Trinity, Laksmï has equally risen in dignity and divinity, and now exercises a far greater influence on modern Hindu society than she did in the times of the Vedic ß9 is. For there are few high-class Hindu house-holds now-a-days where at least one female-wife or daughter-is not christened with one of her names. Immortal Dawn, in the words of a Vedic poet, dis- appears only to rise again.</page></plain_text>
