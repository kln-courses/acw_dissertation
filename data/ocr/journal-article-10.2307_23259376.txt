<plain_text><page sequence="1">Breaking the Laws of Motion: Pneumatology and Belles Lettres in Eighteenth-Century Britain Sara Landreth In his 1755 Dictionary, Samuel Johnson defined motion as both "changing place" and "tendency of the mind" or "thought."1 For twenty-first-century readers, the term motion evokes a physical change of place. Yet from the time of Aristotle until well into the eighteenth century, motion was a comprehensive concept, one that explained not merely physical movement, but all kinds of change, from emotional transport to moral improvement. Long after Newton demonstrated that spatial movement obeyed mathematical laws, many writers—including Newton himself—understood motion as one of the central principles of human nature. This essay aims to recover a lost chapter in the history of reading, writing, and print: the centrality of the concept of motion to Enlightenment theories about rhetoric and belles lettres. I explore the ways that eighteenth-century writers turned to motion in order to explain the moral and emotional changes associated with the written word. This focus points to a broader question about methodology: what does a project about motion contribute to literary studies? I argue that Enlightenment debates about motion reveal key communicative chan nels between the world and the mind, readers and writers, ancients and moderns, the literal and metaphorical. These links in turn point to important protodisciplinary connections between what now seem like strange bedfellows: physics, pneumatology, and poetry. Motion can teach us about theories of reading and writing because for much of the eighteenth century, authors understood all change as motion. This included the changes that a reader might undergo when perusing a poem or a novel: improvement or dissolution, entertainment or sentimental transport. For this reason, motion was a foundational concept not only for physics, but also for the arenas of moral philosophy, theology, and rhetoric. As the didactic aims of writers were grounded in the assumption that a text could change a reader—whether to improve, corrupt, or merely to rouse the passions—it is important to understand how these authors conceived of change as motion. Protoaesthetic debates questioned the nature of cognitive contact: how do external, sensory New Literary History, 2012, 43: 281-308</page><page sequence="2">282 NEW LITERARY HISTORY stimuli—whether a billiard balls or a Bildungsroman—influence the in ternal workings of the mind/soul?2 Authors theorized the physiology of reading in terms of a text's influence on the "motions" of the internal faculties, such as the passions, the fancy, and the reason. This prompted inquiries about inspiration and agency: what causes a person to write? Is the impulse toward composition caused by external stimuli or by some inner "agitation" of the animal spirits? In order to comprehend how Enlightenment writers theorized the moral effects of belletristic writing, we need to understand how they theorized motion. Charting changes in the concept of motion allows me to explore the shared foundations of what later became the separate fields of litera ture, moral philosophy, and natural philosophy. The biochemist Stuart Kauffman has argued that the natural laws developed by Galileo and Newton—which promoted the prestige of scientific "fact" and devalued the humanities' "world of values"—contributed to the later, nineteenth century disciplinary split between the sciences and the humanities.3 In this essay, I focus on the period before this split occurred; during the eighteenth century, motion unified many fields of study, from astronomy to poetry. While an in-depth discussion of the nineteenth-century divi sions between the humanities and the sciences is outside the scope of this article, I wish nevertheless to suggest that charting the narrowing of the concept of motion might provide a new vantage point on what hap pened before disciplinary disaggregation. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, writers attempted to answer some of their most pressing questions in terms of motion. Motion was everywhere in Enlightenment texts: not just in treatises about physics, but also in ser mons, periodicals, encyclopaedias, and epistolary novels. Recent studies have argued that a distinction between "literary" and "nonliterary" genres in the eighteenth century is untenable because our modern categories of "factual" and "imaginative" writing were not yet fully differentiated.4 My account of the shifting concept of motion further confirms that we cannot fully understand the development of belles lettres in isolation from what we call "philosophical" writing. I approach motion not primarily as a theme but rather as a concept. For my definition of a concept, I am indebted to the recent work of Peter de Bolla, who reminds us that a special weight or emphasis is implied by our use of the term concept. De Bolla understands this emphasis in terms of an architectural metaphor, namely, that of "load-bearing concepts": those concepts "which enable us to think (or conceptualize) something else."5 I argue that for much of the eighteenth century, motion was a load-bearing concept. Theories about motion, both ancient and mod ern, enabled writers to explain everything from divine intervention and moral change to the way poetic imagery influenced the passions. I find</page><page sequence="3">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 283 de Bolla's formulation particularly useful when talking about literary historical change. In short, I am interested in what happens when a concept loses the capacity to bear certain loads. I. Motion as Spatial and Moral Change Previous studies of the changing concept of motion have tended to agree with Pope's famous epitaph for Newton: "Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; / God said 'Let Newton be' and all was light." This essay departs from an assumption at the heart of many of these studies: namely, that the dawn of the New Science vanquished occult Scholasti cism and ushered in a new law-based mechanism. No one would deny, of course, that Newton's theories—especially his use of mathematical laws—made crucial, decisive breaks with the older Aristotelian models of motion. Rather, I show that eighteenth-century writers employed both Aristotelian and Newtonian models, and that this mixture of two different—and sometimes contradictory—understandings of movement enabled motion to function as a comprehensive explanatory concept. Because motion denoted both moral and spatial change, writers could employ ideas about movement to explain the kinds of change produced by reading and writing. My concentration here on "Aristotelian" and "Newtonian" thought (at what might seem to be the expense of individual thinkers such as Descartes, Galileo, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and others) intention ally mirrors definitions of motion in Enlightenment texts designed for nonspecialist readers.15 While I recognize the importance of an expert reading elite both in Britain and on the Continent, those readers are not my concern in this essay.7 My interests in the didactic aims of writers necessarily direct my generic focus away from "systems" and philosophi cal treatises (which were, for many lay readers, prohibitively expensive, scarce, and difficult when written in Latin) and toward texts aimed at a broader audience. The genres that I discuss are those that claimed to move and improve a broad readership: encyclopedias, periodicals, and novels. These genres tended to grapple with theories of motion and change not as nuanced surveys of individual thinkers, but rather in terms of the "battle" between ancients and moderns. The Aristotelian and New Science models differed most fundamentally in their focus on the kind of change that motion could explain. Stated simply, Aristotelian motion involved qualitative and teleological change, whereas Newtonian motion involved spatial change. This difference is evident in ancient and modern descriptions of gravity. On the one hand, in Aristotle's writings, motion is an inherent property that determines</page><page sequence="4">284 NEW LITERARY HISTORY an object's being and purpose. De Caelo explains that a heavy object falls not because an external force is exerted upon it, but rather because the heavy object is fulfilling its entelechy, its immanent goal of downward motion.8 On the other hand, Newton's Principia (1687) states that an object falls as a result of the external force of gravity.9 An inanimate object does not contain an internal impulse toward movement. Aristo telian motion is ontological; an object's intrinsic tendency to move or be moved determines the nature of its very being. Book 2 of the Physics divides everything in existence into two kinds of "movers." First, there are "self-movers," such as plants and people, which have within them an active principle or source of motion; and second, there are objects such as a "bed or a garment" that possess a passive principle of motion—the ability to be moved by something else.10 Both active and passive principles of motion were inherent qualities that determined an object's being. As a result, Aristotle understood motion as qualitative change, a shift in a person or thing from one state into another. For this reason, growing, learning, healing, and aging were prime examples of motion.11 In the Aristotelian tradition, motion explains human morality as "the way in which humanity moves and is moved towards its telos."12 Aristotle divided human motion into "natural" and "violent."13 Natural human motion participates in the motions of the cosmos and is therefore ultimately oriented toward the Good. Violent human motion is that which moves away from the Good. Hence, moral improvement is a kind of natural motion, whereas corruption is a form of violent motion. Newton's explanation of force in the Principia eliminated ontology from his definition of motion. Newton argued that "motion is neither gener ated nor caused except by forces impressed upon the moving body."14 In other words, motion only concerns the spatial position of a body; it does not articulate a body's essential qualities. Motion is a temporal state, not an ontological quality. As Michael Buckley and R. S. Westfall have argued, this was a substantial departure from earlier models: "Seventeenth [-cen tury] mechanics tended to think of force as a characteristic of a body in motion. But the Newtonian mechanics offer 'quite a different definition of force, an external action of a body producing a change in motion.'"15 The motion that resulted from force did not involve qualitative change. Eighteenth-century popularizers of Newton tended to emphasize the difference between ancient, Aristotelian models and the "improved" theories associated with the New Science. Many ignored Galileo and Descartes, who both challenged the Aristotelian model decades before Newton did, in favor of England's native son. In the entry on Motion in his 1728 Cyclopcedia, Ephraim Chambers ascribes the "advantages" of modern natural philosophy to a "cultivation]" of a law-based understanding of motion.16 The fundamental difference between the "antients" (followers</page><page sequence="5">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 285 of Aristotle) and "modern philosophers" (Newtonians) was the latter's focus on laws: "All the Phenomena of Nature, all the Changes that happen in the System of Bodies, are owing to Motion; and are directed according to the Laws thereof. Hence, the modern Philosophers have apply'd themselves particularly to cultivate the Doctrine of Motion; to investigate the Properties, Laws, &amp;c. Thereof. . . . And to this we owe the great Advantages of modern Philosophy above that of the Antients; who were extremely disregardful of Motion; notwithstanding that they seem'd so sensible of its Importance, that they defined Nature by the first Principle of Motion" (2:586-91). Chambers goes on to stress that one of the greatest improvements made by "modern Philosophy" is the rejection of motion as "passage out of one state and into another" (2:586-91). The Aristotelian model rests on two fundamentally flawed assumptions: first, that motion is a property of matter; and second, that motion is a form of teleologically driven ontological change. Chambers's Cyclopedia entry is typical of eighteenth-century synopses of ancient and modern theories for lay readers in that it differentiates between two broad versions of motion-as-change: on the one hand, Aristotelians misunderstood motion as qualitative change caused by an internal drive toward a telos; on the other hand, modern Newtonians correctly think about motion as a form of spatial change caused by external forces and governed by mathematical law. But what of those motions that could be neither quantified nor direcdy observed? When it came to the motions of the mind, eighteenth-century writers tended to blur the boundaries between the kinds of change that motion could explain. Indeed, while Chambers's entry on motion marks a clear divide between "antient" ontological/qualitative motion and "modern" spatial/quantitative motion, this distinction does not hold in other Cyclopedia entries that address the motions involved in human mental change. II. Motion and Emotion In his Cyclopedia entry on passion, Chambers relies on an understand ing of motion that looks suspiciously similar to the Aristotelian theories that he dismissed in his entry on motion. The entry outlines seven distinct steps that occur each time a person's passions are moved. Steps one through five involve a series of physical motions that are communicated from the sense organs to inner agitations of the animal spirits: first is the motion of the eyes; second, the motion of the will; third, sensations of motion in the passions; fourth, "a new . . . Course of the Spirits towards the several Parts of the Body"; and fifth, "sensible motion of the soul,</page><page sequence="6">286 NEW LITERARY HISTORY which finds itself shaken by this sudden over-flowing of Spirits" (2:760). In steps six and seven, however, the motions of the passions change from spatial to moral: "The sixth is the different Sensations of Love, Hatred &amp;c. caus'd, not by the intellectual View of Good or Evil, but by the dif ferent Shakes or Pulses, the animal Spirits occasion in the Brain. The last is a certain Sensation of Joy, or inward Satisfaction, which detains the Soul in its Passion, and attests to its being in the State it ought to be with Regard to that Object" (2:760). In Chambers's list, material "Shakes or Pulses" sufficiently explain how the passions work only until he gets to the quality of the soul's well-being. Step six insists that animal spirits are not responsible for one's "View of Good or Evil." In step seven, the resulting moral improvement is ultimately not a physiological change, but rather a teleological change toward "the State [the soul] ought to be" in. In other words, the soul has achieved its telos. Here, Chambers describes the motions caused by the passions as both spatial and qualita tive. In so doing, he is guilty of the Aristotelian offence of using motion to explain, in his own words, "the passage out of one state into another" (2:586-91). It is important to note that Chambers does not refer to the "shakes and pulses" of the passions in a metaphorical sense. His entry on passion explains cognitive contact as a series of material motions that are first transferred through the physical sense organs, then communicated to the quasi-physical animal spirits and finally become moral motions that affect one's immaterial soul. The crucial "tipping point" at which this motion shifts from spatial/material to moral/immaterial is conspicuously absent from Chambers's chain of causality. Chambers's understanding of how motion is transmitted from outer senses to inner sensation follows Newton's 1713 edition of the Opticks, which conceived of the experience of sound and sight as a chain of causal motions: "For a sound in a Bell or musical String ... is nothing but a trembling Motion . . . and in the Sensorium, 'tis a Sense of that Motion under the Form of Sound; so Colours ... in the Rays are nothing but their Dispositions to propagate this or that Motion into the Sensorium, and in the Sensorium they are the Sensations of those Motions under the Forms of Colours."17 Newton describes external sounds and colours as invisible but nonetheless mate rial motions that "propagate . . . Motion into the Sensorium" and then, through some cognitive alchemy, become "sensations" in the mind. Both Newton's and Chambers's descriptions of sensory experience point to another term for which motion was a load-bearing concept: emo tion. The OED's first two definitions of emotion point to change that is both physical ("movement, disturbance") and spatial ("a movement from one place to another"). These definitions are exemplified by a quota</page><page sequence="7">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 287 tion from John Woodward's An Essay Toward a Natural History of the Earth (1695), in which emotion refers to the effects of Newtonian gravitational force: an "Emotion ... of the common center of gravity."18 Enlighten ment writers used the term emotion to describe what twenty-first century readers would define as motion; emotion signified "moving, stirring, agita tion, perturbation (in physical sense)" until the late eighteenth century. The OED references two articles from the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions that employ the term emotion to describe the shaking of an earthquake (in 1758) and the swirling of vitriol in a chemical experiment (in 1772). During this same period (1660-1775), emotion also indicated "any agitation or disturbance of mind, feeling, passion; any vehement or excited mental state." For Enlightenment writers, then, the term emotion denoted both tectonic disturbance and passionate unrest. Attempts to explain emotional states in terms of motion were a key component of what John Yolton terms the "thinking matter controversy."19 Yolton shows how Enlightenment disputes about the nature of motion centered on whether or not the mind was material (animated gray matter) or immaterial (an indivisible soul), or some rarefied, quasi-material sub stance (pneumatological "animal spirits"). Discussions of thinking matter often skirted blasphemy: if the soul were material, then how could it be immortal? Immortality required indivisibility, and indivisibility required immateriality. At the heart of the thinking matter controversy was an iatromechanical question: did the human mind/soul move in the same way as observable, physical bodies? When, at forty-six, Descartes reflected upon his youthful theories about the mind, he rejected as folly the no tion that mind and matter moved in the same way. Descartes blamed his former conviction that gravity was caused by teleological motion on a mistaken assumption that the natural world followed the same laws as the human mind: "what makes it especially clear that my idea of grav ity was taken largely from the idea I had of the mind is the fact that I thought that gravity carried bodies towards the centre of the earth as if it had some knowledge of the centre within itself. For this surely could not happen without knowledge, and there can be no knowledge except in a mind. . . . But later on I made the observations which led me to make a careful distinction between the idea of the mind and the ideas of body and corporeal motion."20 Descartes rejects the Aristotelian model of gravitational motion because it is anthropomorphic.21 He maintains that the motions of the mind/soul and the motions of physical matter are fundamentally different; the former possesses knowledge whereas the latter cannot. Inherent in this argument is Descartes's dualism. As the mind/soul is immaterial and the body is material, it makes sense that they would not obey the same laws of motion.</page><page sequence="8">288 NEW LITERARY HISTORY This dualism was not so clear-cut, however, in most popular accounts of motion. In the first half of the eighteenth century, encyclopedias and periodicals presented definitions of motion that were neither exclusively physical nor exclusively metaphysical. Chambers and others looked to John Locke, who emphasized that Newton's laws could—and should—be applied to the human mind. In his Essay Concerning Human Understand ing (1690), Locke admits that he "cannot . . . understand how bodies without us can any ways affect our senses, but by the immediate contact of sensible bodies themselves, as in tasting or feeling, or the impulse of some sensible particles coming from them, as in seeing, hearing, and smelling."22 A sensory organ such as the eye was unquestionably mate rial and was therefore influenced by the material motion of "particles." But how, precisely, were these corporeal "impulses" transmitted to the incorporeal soul? If the soul were immaterial, how was it moved by something material? How, in other words, did spatial change become moral change? Many writers followed Newton in his refusal to "feign hypotheses" about these questions. While David Hartley maintained that the passions originated in tiny vibrating structures in the brain called "vibratiuncles," he refused to speculate about the precise nature of the "small parts of matter" whose tremors produced emotional response.23 As I mentioned above, Newton's own Opticks did not presuppose a partition between spatial and moral motion, nor did it strictly separate the study of physics from the study of the human mind.24 We must, then, remove our disciplinary blinders when attempting to sort out the ways that eighteenth-century writers classified knowledge about motion. John Guillory and others have argued that during the Enlightenment, belles lettres, moral philosophy, and natural science were all oriented toward—and underwritten by—a shared empiricist epistemology.25 Be low, I show that debates about thinking matter can be understood in terms of a conceptual interchange between Aristotelian and Newtonian motion; and second, that such theories were central not only to moral philosophy, but also to rhetoric and belles lettres. After all, if a writer was to move or improve her reader, this change involved both material and moral motion. III. Pneumatology: Between Physics and Metaphysics Enlightenment writers sought a discourse that would allow motion to explain changes in both the body and the mind/soul. For many, this field was pneumatology. Prior to the eighteenth century, pneumatol ogy was a scholastic field of study: the branch of metaphysics that dealt</page><page sequence="9">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 289 with angels, demons, the soul, and a priori knowledge of God.26 This was true for much of the seventeenth century, when pneumatology was concerned primarily with angelology and spirits. By the end of the 1690s, all this had changed.27 As Newtonianism prompted moral philosophers to turn their gaze inward in search of universal laws of moral motion, pneumatology began to focus solely on human spiritual substances: the animal spirits and the soul.28 This prompted questions about where pneumatology fit into the broader map of knowledge. While some writ ers argued that pneumatology belonged to physics, others assigned it to metaphysics, and still others—those who did not view these as mutually exclusive fields—placed it under both headings.29 Thus, in the early eighteenth century, pneumatology emerged as a distinct but embattled field of study. By the 1730s, dictionaries, encyclopedias, and "systems" of knowledge defined pneumatology as "speculative moral philosophy."30 This was a "speculative" endeavor in that it adhered both to an older, a priori model and a new, empirical approach encouraged by Baconians and Newtonians. This meant that writing about pneumatology relied on what Norman Fiering has called a "peculiar mixture" of revealed truth and naturally derived evidence.31 Pneumatology approached the mind as neither wholly material nor wholly immaterial, but somewhere in between. It was neither physics nor metaphysics, neither natural philosophy nor moral philosophy. If one assumed that mental activity could be explained in terms of motion, this raised a vexing question: what, precisely, was moving? Did rarefied substances like the animal spirits—or, even more troubling, the imma terial soul—obey Newton's laws of motion? Could something without an extended material body be said to move? For many, pneumatology provided a middle ground. Writers who opposed the materialist theses of Hobbes and Spinoza found in pneumatology the freedom to withhold judgment on the precise distinction between spirit and matter and, at the same time, to concede the importance of the mind/soul as an entity that was both self-moving and moved from without. As James Chandler explains, writers often "supplemented . . . mechanism by adding incor poreal substances to explain things that they thought mechanism itself could not explain."32 When straining to glimpse the connections between physical change and moral change, it helped to envision a quasi-material medium or "vehicle" as a go-between. Hence, while pneumatological texts often begin by insisting upon fundamental differences between matter and spirit, they promptly blur these boundaries to focus on the f/MflS7-corporea): ethers, vapors, and other rarefied substances. Entries on pneumatology in Chambers's Cyclopcedia exemplify the difficulty of distinguishing between the motion of material objects and</page><page sequence="10">290 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the motion of the immaterial "spirits" of the human mind. Chambers's "View of Knowledge"—a complex chart in the Cyclopcedia's introductory pages—grafted pneumatology and pneumatics onto entirely different branches of knowledge (see Fig. 1). Pneumatology is part of "Meta physicks," whereas "Pneumaticks" belongs to "Quantities of Bodies" or "Mix'd Mathematicks." According to Chambers's schema, pneumatol ogy involves knowledge that is beyond the physical and hence cannot be quantified, whereas pneumatics measures the physical properties of air. The main body of the Cyclopcedia, however, contradicts Chambers's chart. Here, pneumatology and pneumatics appear under the same en try, defined as the "Doctrine and Contemplation of Spirits and Spiritual Substances." What is more, Chambers's entry privileges pneumatics over pneumatology; it curtly directs readers interested in "the human mind" to see "Metaphysicks," and then dwells upon a lavish, fold-out engrav ing featuring air pumps, pressure gauges, and windmills (2:841). In the entry on "Metaphysicks," the reader encounters a perplexing circular ity: "Some define [Metaphysics] as that part of Science which considers Spirits and immaterial beings; which others chuse to distinguish by the name of Pneumaticks . . . See Pneumaticks" (2:543). This too seems to contravene the "View"; in the chart, pneumatics is a subfield of meta physics, whereas in the body of the Cyclopedia, it is another name for metaphysics itself. While the "View" separates the study of the animal spirits in the human mind from the study of spirituous "substances" like air, Chambers's entries reveal the difficulty of fully separating the two. The Cyclopcedia underscores two important features of eighteenth century pneumatology: first, that many popularizers of philosophical knowledge tended to demote pneumatology in comparison to pneu matics; and second, that this demotion seems to have had something to do with pneumatology's lack of empirical grounding. On the one hand, pneumatics is a field that involves precision instrumentation and measurement that can be conveyed in detailed print engravings. On the other hand, pneumatology remained a field that dealt with the invisible and unquantifiable mind/soul. By 1771, James Beattie could declare that pneumatology was beneath "the dignity of a science" in large part because it did not conform to the new, empirical bent of Newtonian ism.33 One's mind/soul might be in motion, but one could not, after all, measure or quantify that motion. This fact—that cognition did not conform to Newtonian standards of measureable motion—made pneumatology an easy target for satirists. In a 1763 pamphlet, entitled Physiognomy, Being a Sketch . . .Wherein the Dif ferent Tempers, Passions and Manners of Men Will be Particularly Considered," the Anglican clergyman John Clubbe satirized a Newtonian approach</page><page sequence="11">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 291 . *. • r i»l.

In his description of his "experiments," Clubbe's "Figure C" (labeled "Partial Gravity" in the frontispiece) exemplifies how a person's reading habits might influence the motions of his mind: "The next figure amazed me. Twice it fluttered up to comparative Levity, came down to its first direction, mounted again; and in this fluctuating manner continued for a time. Suspecting some unfairness in the subject of my experiment, I examined [Figure C's] pockets."38 In one pocket, Clubbe's narrator finds Methodist sermons; in the other, he finds "a small common-place-book filled with extracts" from notorious freethinkers, many of whom argued for a materialist understanding of the soul.36 Figure C's books cause erratic "flutterings" in his mind; Methodist "enthusiasm" and freethinking "impudence" pull him in different moral directions. The contrary messages of these texts set Figure C's mental gravity "whirling" into an irregular orbit. Clubbe's contraption converts the moral sense of "gravity" as seriousness or earnestness into a spatial, Newtonian theory of force. His machine demonstrates what happens when one conflates the motions of matter with the motions of the mind/soul. While the former can be quantified, the latter cannot. Clubbe was not the first to imagine measuring the pneumatological effects of literature. On April 30, 1751, Johnson's Rambler proposed an experiment to gauge the brainpower of London's poets. Johnson's fictional philosopher, Hypertatus, promises to reveal, in "a complete treatise of barometrical pneumatology," the laws of motion that govern the act of writing.37 Rambler 117, like Clubbe's pamphlet, pokes fun at the idea that one could quantify the motions of thought. Johnson's unreliable narrator confuses pneumatology with pneumatics; to 'judge decisively" of a poet's "faculties," Hypertatus must first observe the poet at various levels of atmospheric pressure, from below sea level to the sky-scraping fifth story: I. . . take some opportunity of attending him from the cellar to the garret, and try upon him all various degrees of rarefaction and condensation, tension and laxity. If he is neither vivacious aloft, nor serious below, I then consider him as hopeless; but as it seldom happens, that I do not find the temper to which the texture of his brain is fitted, I accommodate him in time with a tube of mercury, first marking the point most favourable to his intellects, according to rules which I have long studied, and which I may, perhaps, reveal to mankind in a complete treatise of barometrical pneumatology.38</page><page sequence="13">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 293 Here, Johnson's joke depends on a key distinction: while pneumatics deals with the material motions of air, pneumatology focuses on the mo tions of the human mind. Hypertatus's "tube of mercury," like Clubbe's device, satirizes the notion that the mental activity could be measured like gases in an air pump. Even the name "Hypertatus"—an amalgam of the Greek prefix hyper-, signifying "over, beyond, above measure" and the Latin suffix -tatus, meaning "small" or "local"—embodies the difficulty of quantifying the intellectual acuity required for composition. How can one account for poetic aptitude, which seems to arise simultaneously from both an incalculable source of inspiration and the pulpous mar row of the skull? Johnson revisited this issue two decades later in his Thoughts on the Late Transactions Concerning Falkland's Islands (1771): "In the inanimate action of matter upon matter, the motion produced can be but equal to the force of the moving power; but the operations of life, whether private or publick, admit no such laws. The caprices of vol untary agents laugh at calculation."39 As self-moving, "voluntary agents," human beings elude the sorts of "calculation" possible with the physical "action of matter upon matter." Johnson notes that it is difficult to trace chains of causality in the affairs of men because the human mind/soul does not obey the forces of action and reaction laid out in Newton's third law. And yet, as I show below, analogies between the motions of the mind and the motions of the natural world are crucial to those writings of Johnson's—whether satirical or somber—that attempt to explain the mental processes involved in reading and writing. Like pneumatology, rhetoric was concerned with the transmission of motion and emotion. Both fields attempted to answer questions about action at a distance: pneumatological texts asked how quasi-material substances transmitted motion from body to soul; rhetorical manuals asked how one could best transmit emotion or information from writer/speaker to reader/ listener. Pneumatology and rhetoric both pondered the communication of motion across distance and between different domains. Whether the difference was between matter and spirit or between one mind and another, change could only occur once an existing gap was bridged. IV. Moving in Order to Move: Rhetoric, Belles Lettres, and Automatic Writing In the relatively scant scholarly attention paid to Rambler 117, critics have focused on the paper's satire of contemporary science and have largely ignored the fact that Hypertatus's primary focus is not barom etry but rather belles lettres. 40 Johnson's fictional correspondent outlines</page><page sequence="14">294 NEW LITERARY HISTORY a "theory of the garret," in which he claims that the earth's rotation influences writer's block: The . . . cause of the gaiety and sprightliness of the dwellers in garrets is prob ably the increase of that vertiginous motion, with which we are carried round by the diurnal revolution of the earth. The power of agitation upon the spirits is well known; every man has felt his heart lightened in a rapid vehicle, or on a galloping horse; and nothing is plainer, than that he who towers to the fifth story, is whirled through more space by every circumrotation, than another that grovels upon the ground-floor . . . and therefore . . . whenever celerity and acuteness are requisite, we must actuate our languor by taking a few turns round the center in a garret.41 Hypertatus bases his theories on the "well-known" fact that rapid transit causes passionate transport; this proves that spatial change "agitat[es]" the animal spirits and transforms "languor" into "gaiety." According to Bo swell, Johnson himself "expressed his love of driving fast in a post-chaise" and hinted at the amorous side-effects of such movement.4- Hypertatus's theory combines Newtonian/spatial change (motion physically shakes up the animal spirits) and Aristotelian/qualitative change (motion is a passage from a state of languor into one of sprightliness). In satirizing the notion that moving matter could produce poetic genius, Johnson explores the problematic nature of motion-based chains of causality. Indeed, Hypertatus's theory of the garret poses the same crucial question left unanswered by Newton's Opticks and Chambers's Cyclopedia: how do mere "shakes and pulses" cause a shift from insipidity to inspiration? Johnson's "theory of the garret" demonstrates the impossibility of fully untangling ancient and modern models of motion-as-change in eighteenth-century belles lettres. In his Cyclopedia entry on poetry, Cham bers—like Hypertatus—explains poetic inspiration in terms of spatial motion: "Inspiration arises from the Poet, as its Centre, and is diffus'd, in orbem, in a less degree of intenseness, the further it recedes from him" (l:x-xi). Here, poetic inspiration obeys something akin to Newton's inverse square law, which held that the force of gravity was inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Newton illustrated this basic principle with his famous projectile thought ex periment, which asks readers to imagine colossal rocks launched from the summit of a high peak (Fig. 3). When hurled a short distance, the rocks, subject to gravity, strike the earth (letters D, E, F, and G). With sufficient velocity, however, a projectile will fly far enough that it continues around the earth in orbit, where the force of gravity is insuf ficient to pull it to the ground. This was Newton's momentous insight: that the moon and a rock obeyed the same laws of motion, as did all</page><page sequence="15">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 295 Fig. 3. Illustration in Newton, A Treatise of the System of the World (London: F. Fayram), 6. the planets and their satellites, and, by extension, everything else in the Prime Mover's creation. Hence, Chambers assumes that the changes involved in poetic response follow the same laws as the natural world. This Newtonian theorization of poetic inspiration demonstrates that belles lettres shared an empirical foundation with natural philosophy. For Chambers and his contemporaries, Newtonian motion was not entirely at odds with an Aristotelian model in which motion explained moral or emotional change. The kinds of change undergone by a reader—moral improvement or emotional transport—seemed to involve, on the one hand, quasi-material changes in the animal spirits and, on the other, a shift from one state into another. As such, when Enlightenment writers set out to explain how rhetorical techniques moved or improved one's readers, they tended to employ both spatial and moral conceptualiza tions of motion. While interconnections between natural philosophy and belles lettres are not self-evident to twenty-first century readers, Enlightenment writers often took them for granted. We must recover these protodisciplinary links in order to fully understand the shared history between what we now assume to be three separate fields: literary studies, psychology, and physics. In Rambler 117, pneumatic motion affects a writer's ability to move his or her readers. Hypertatus maps a writer's literary abilities onto an atmospheric topography that ranges from more to less material, from the "dense . . . vapours" at street level to the "thin ether" up in a garret: I have discovered by a long series of observations, that invention and elocution suffer great impediments from dense and impure vapours, and that the tenuity of a defecated air at a proper distance from the surface of the earth, accelerates</page><page sequence="16">296 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the fancy, and sets at liberty those intellectual powers which were before shackled by too strong attraction, and unable to expand themselves under the pressure of a gross atmosphere. I have found dulness to quicken into sentiment in a thin ether, as water, though not very hot, boils in a receiver pardy exhausted; and heads in appearance empty have teemed with notions upon rising ground, as flaccid sides of a football would have swelled out into stiffness and extension.43 The scatological humor—that "defecated air" might, after rising to be sniffed by a poet in his garret, "accelerate the fancy"—participates in the long tradition of "flatulent brain" jokes that play on analogies between pneumatics and pneumatology. But Hypertatus does not merely confuse wind for animal spirits; he blurs the distinction between literal and figu rative representations of motion. In the first sentence, a poet's mental faculties behave like material bodies subject to Newtonian inertia: the motion of the fancy "accelerates" once the "intellectual powers" are no longer "shackled" by the "attraction" of gravity. In the second sentence, Hypertatus shifts to similes: "dulness" quickens "as water . . . boils" in an air pump, and "notions" "tee[m]" "as a football . . . swell[s]" in a vacuum. These similes bring the reader back to materiality; one's intellect moves like other material things (water and footballs) move. This shift to simile presses the reader to question whether earlier descriptions of motion—such as the fancy's "acceleration"—were literal or figurative. Here, as elsewhere in Rambler 117, Hypertatus's diction juggles both spatial and moral models at the same time. His conclusion collapses Newtonian and Aristotelian motion into one another; when "dulness quickens into sentiment" a quantitative change in speed is one and the same with a qualitative improvement in rhetorical prowess. Johnson draws attention to the fact that when one cannot draw a clear distinction between metaphysical and physical motion, this causes a corresponding problem in the realm of representation. This raises a number of seri ous questions: can visible, spatial motion serve as a useful analogy for invisible moral motion? Or should we rather understand material and moral motion as existing on the same literal continuum? How can one represent the moment in which spatial change causes—or becomes—a kind of moral or intellectual change? The quotation above alludes to three of the traditional parts of rhetoric: not only "invention and elocution" but also—with its images of poets whirling and turning—"action," the gestures that a speaker makes as part of his rhetorical performance. Throughout the eighteenth century, a young man's rhetorical training involved memorizing gestures that cor responded to different themes and moods.44 Manuals such as The Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor (1790) instructed budding gesticulators with geometric exactitude (see Fig. 4). In Idler 90 (1760), Johnson ridicules</page><page sequence="17">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 297 speakers who rely on such "laboured gesticulation:" "Neither the judges of our laws, nor the representatives of our people, would . . . believe any man the more because he rolled his eyes, or puffed his cheeks, or spread abroad his arms, or stamped the ground, or thumped his breast."45 Part of what makes this "attitudinizing" rhetorician so blameworthy is the fact that he—unlike the garret dweller in Rambler 117—is fully in control of his own paroxysms. While Hypertatus's poet has the power to ascend to the uppermost loft (and, in so doing, to be "whirled . . . 'round the centre" of the earth at a higher speed), he is not the author of his own movements. Rather, he is acted upon by atmospheric and gravitational factors. Read together, these explorations of pneumatological and rhe torical motion in Johnson's periodicals—however satirical—urge the reader to strive for a kind of balance. If he or she wants to persuade, inform, or move a reader/listener, a poet/speaker must be neither a slave to natural law nor an artificial, affected self-mover. Johnson, perhaps more than any other writer of his age, wrestled with involuntary motion in his everyday life. Shortly after his death in 1784, an anonymous obituary fondly described Johnson's erratic gait as a kind of perambulatory automatism: "When he walked the streets, what with the constant roll of his head, and the concomitant motion Fig. 4. Plate I, 'The Elements of Gesture," in The Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor (1790), which instructs the young speaker to "position [his] arm" at "an angle of forty-five degrees" as if it were the "diagonal [of an] imaginary figure."46</page><page sequence="18">298 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of his body, he appeared to make his way by that motion, independent of his feet."47 Johnson suffered from what Boswell called a "convulsive ... distemper"—a disorder similar to Tourette's Syndrome—that caused involuntary "motions and tricks": "While talking or even musing as he sat in his chair, he commonly . . . shook [his head] in a tremulous man ner, moving his body backwards and forwards."48 Jonathan Kramnick has recently argued that, between 1650 and 1750, British writers were preoccupied with questions of how, precisely, a person moved him or herself.49 Involuntary self-motion—whether in the form of seizures or a newborn's instinctive suckling—raised particularly vexing questions because such automatic actions seemed at odds with free will. We have seen how Descartes and Chambers criticized the Aristotelian model of motion for granting the power of self-motion to inanimate objects. And yet, in arguing that motion was a force imposed upon matter from without, the Newtonian model had the potential to go too far in the other direction—to rob human beings of agency. A man can, after all, cause himself to turn a page or peel an orange or kick a rock, but his self-motion will always be limited by God's universal laws. Rambler 117 demonstrates how the conceptual status of motion in writing about belles lettres raises similarly difficult questions. If the physiology of reading could be explained by the mind's passive reception of motion, how did this reflect on our understanding of the act of writing? Was writing a fully self-directed act, or was it merely another involuntary reaction to environmental factors? Johnson was not the only writer of his day to try to imagine the act of writing as a problem of self-motion. Seventeen years after Rambler 117, Sterne's Sentimental Journey (1768) drew suggestive connections between external "promptings" and a writer's own agency. As Parson Yorick ex plains it, "Nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest for, I walk'd out into the coach yard to buy or hire something of that kind ... an old Desobligeant in the furthest corner of the court, hit my fancy at first sight, so I instantly got into it, and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings ... I took out my pen and ink and wrote the preface."50 Sterne then presents a chapter break, from "THE DESOBLIGEANT, CALAIS" to "PREFACE IN THE DESOBLIGEANT." Yorick complains that he could more easily write a taxonomy of travellers if his carriage would only stop jostling: "This brings me to my point ... if the see-saw of this Desobligeant will but let me get on."51 For a few pages, it seems as if the chapter break indicated yet another temporal jump; presumably, the "see-saw" motion indicates that Yorick has embarked on his journey. As we soon learn, however, Yorick has been, all along, writing in a station ary vehicle: "Where then, my dear countrymen, are you going?—We are</page><page sequence="19">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 299 only looking at this chaise, said they. . . . We were wondering, said one of them . . . what could occasion its motion.—'Twas the agitation, said I, coolly, of writing a preface."52 Yorick's "see-saw" motion came not from without, but from within, from what he calls "the harmony" between the coach itself and his own feelings. James Chandler has posed a series of important questions about this passage: "What does it mean for Yorick to say that he entered the Desobligeant only after finding it in 'tolerable harmony with [his] feelings?' What does this peculiar sense of accord with his feelings have to do with the motion observed in the vehicle . . .? How is one to understand the agitation of the Preface in relation to the motion of the vehicle?"53 I suggest that we explore these inquiries in light of the eighteenth-century connections between pneumatology and rhetoric that I have been discussing. Yorick is first "prompted" by "nature" to choose and enter this particular carriage; its image "hits" his fancy according to a Newtonian/Lockean model of cognitive contact. But this impulse is also in keeping with a teleological, Aristotelian model: nature moves us, according to Yorick, toward "the thing we are fittest for." This harmony between the desobligeant and Yorick's feelings causes a kind of reciprocal motion that is both spatial and moral, Newtonian and Aristotelian. The carriage moves Yorick to write his Preface, and the act of writing in turn moves the carriage. His mode of transportation and his emotional transport meld into one. At stake in these blurred boundaries is the very nature of free will. Sterne reminds his readers that it is impossible to pinpoint the origins of agency; the act of writ ing seems to originate a posteriori from external stimuli and also a priori from the writer's own fancy. In place of "the chicken or the egg" conundrum, Sterne asks us to ponder which came first: human agency or natural causality. In yet another scene about involuntary writing set in a coach, Harley, the antihero of Mackenzie's The Man of Feeling (1771), draws connections between the spatial motion of travel and the impulse to compose poetry: Harley, pulling out a little pocket-book, began to examine the contents. . . . "Th[ese]," said he, turning to his companion . . . "are quotations from those humble poets, who trust their fame to the brittle tenure of windows and drinking glasses." "From our inn," returned the gentleman, "a stranger might imagine that we were a nation of poets; machines at least containing poetry, which the motion of a journey emptied of their contents. Is it from the vanity of being thought geniuses, or a mere mechanical imitation of the custom of others, that we are tempted to scrawl rhime upon such places?"54 Although Harley does not yet know it, the "gentleman" with whom he shares the stagecoach is Ben Silton, the celebrated poet. Hence, Silton</page><page sequence="20">300 NEW LITERARY HISTORY implicates himself when he describes the process of composition as a passive one; British writers are "machines . . . containing poetry, which the motion of a journey emptied of their contents." It is the motion of the journey—not of the poet's mind—that has agency. A writer is at the mercy of spatial motion; any poetry he might already possess in the "machine" of his mind/soul can only be shaken loose by external factors. Indeed, Silton offers only two, equally dismal motivations for writing poetry: either one writes because his vanity drives him to do so or because he cannot help it; in the latter case, he writes almost involuntarily in "mere mechanical imitation" of other writers. In both cases, the composition of poetry is not, as it is for Yorick, the result of a sentimental "harmony" between the spatial motions of the world and the moral motions of the "feelings." It is clear that the conceptual history of motion provides a key context for eighteenth-century writers who, like Johnson, Sterne, and Macken zie, link the (in) activity of writing to spatial movement. Read against the protodisciplinary links between pneumatology and rhetoric, these discussions of literary motion are not merely metaphorical, but some thing more. Because motion explained both spatial and moral change, pneumatology, rhetoric, and belles lettres all draw upon motion-based chains of causation: how does physical motion cause metaphysical emo tions, and vice versa? How did the motions of a writer's thoughts move a reader's mind/soul? It followed, then, that motion-based causality also posed thorny questions about volition and self-motion: what caused a writer's mind to be moved in the first place? Johnson's revisions to his Dictionary reveal that even as English usage began to recognize stricter boundaries between Newtonian and Aristotelian definitions of motion, these questions of causality and agency remained central to debates about how the mind moved and was moved by other minds. V. Revising Motion in Johnson's Dictionary In the second half of the century, writers increasingly blamed the fierce disagreements about the nature of motion on ambiguous language. In a paper read before the Royal Society in 1778, Isaac Milner blamed both a "loose . . . way of speaking" and "terms which do not necessar ily imply the same thing" for the fact that "the laws by which motion is communicated [were] still very materially mistaken."55 I will close this essay by returning to Johnson's definitions of motion in the Dictionary,56 Faced with limited time and resources, Johnson was able to make only a few key changes to the 1773 edition in order to correct "deficiencies."57</page><page sequence="21">BREAKING THE LAWS OF MOTION 301 This makes it all the more significant that one of the most heavily ed ited entries was that on motion. While the 1755 edition of the Dictionary listed six definitions for motion, the 1773 edition doubled the number of entries to twelve (see Table 1). These revisions reflect what Johnson took to be significant changes in the concept of motion. Table 1 shows thatjohnson keeps "the act of changing place" as the first definition, but adds the phrase "opposed to rest."58 To modern readers, Johnson's addition seems tautological because we assume that a body "in motion" cannot also be "at rest." We take for granted that motion and rest are quantitatively different instances of the same state; when a great enough force is exerted on an object at rest, that object will move. According to the Aristotelian model, however, "rest" was not merely the absence of motion.59 The Physics defined "rest" not as a negative lack of movement but rather as a positive attainment of fulfillment. An object is at rest only when it has realized its potential. Johnson's addition of "opposed to rest" incorporates the principle of inertia expressed in Newton's first law: "Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed."60 Here, Newton establishes that the relation of "motion" to "rest" is determined by "forces impressed," not by a telos. Hence, by adding "opposed to rest," Johnson excludes qualitative or moral change. Given that Johnson's aim in the Dictionary was descriptive rather than prescriptive, these revisions indicate that between 1755 and 1773, the primary meaning of motion in English usage shifted to spatial, rather than moral, change. Johnson's new second and third definitions corroborate a shift in the concept of motion toward a Newtonian, spatial denotation. In his 1773 entry, definitions 2 and 3 provide a useful contrast between the motion of "bodies" and the motions of animate "life"; whereas the former is governed by "the laws of motion," the latter is not. Here, physics and pneumatology are sundered; the motions of "bodies" and the motions of animal spirits do not obey the same laws. Indeed, the replacement in definition 4 of "thought" with "thought impressed" further demarcates the boundaries between spatial and moral change (emphasis mine). The significance of this added "impressed" becomes apparent when we con sider one of the Newtonians' greatest departures from the Aristotelian framework: the premise that motion is spatial change impressed upon matter from outside forces. A stone does not fall because it is fulfilling its teleological drive to move downward; rather, it moves because of external gravitational force. Johnson's addition of "impressed" indicates that, by 1773, the word motion primarily denoted cognition caused by external stimuli.

Johnson's revisions demonstrate that, after midcentury, theories about motion were in a state of conceptual flux. The change to "thought impressed" suggests that by the 1770s, writers privilege a Newtonian model of motion as spatial change caused by external forces. The passive "impressed" also calls to mind the conundrum raised by Hypertatus, Yorick, and Ben Silton: how, especially when accounting for acts of invention and elocution, can we differentiate between internal and external sources of agency? How much of the mind/soul's activity is impressed from without? Most notable is Johnson's shift of the definition that specifies "Ten dency of mind" or "thought," from fourth to tenth place. In The Plan of a Dictionary (1747), Johnson declared his intention to "sort the several senses of each word" in the following order: first, a word's most "natural" (that is, literal) meaning; second, its "consequential" or applied meaning; next its "metaphorical sense"; then, if applicable, its "poetic sense."61 Ac cording to this organization, in the eighteen years between the 1755 and 1773 editions, the definition of motion as "thought" became less literal and more "metaphorical." In other words, while in 1755 Britons might have referred to the "motions of thought" in a literal, pneumatological sense, a writer in 1773 was more likely to comprehend a phrase like "motions of thought" as figurative language. Johnson's choice of illustrative quotation, however, suggests that he was not ready to fully banish motion-as-thought to the realm of metaphor. Both editions use a quotation from a 1691 sermon by the Anglican divine Robert South to exemplify "Tendency of mind": "Let a Man universally observe, and obey every good Motion rising in his heart, knowing that every such Motion proceeds from God."62 South's sermon "on conscience" describes these moral motions as a direct conduit between God's will and men's souls. Immediately before the excerpted line, South insists that the internal "motions" caused by God are not metaphorical: "There is something more in those Expressions of being led by the Spirit. . . and the like, than Mere Tropes and Metaphors; and nothing less is, or can be imported by them, than that God sometimes speaks to, and converses with the Hearts of Men, immediately by himself."63 This is not a deist cosmol ogy in which a clockwork universe ticks on without the need for divine rewinding. South conceived of God's "moral motions" not as action at a distance but rather as a form of immediate, qualitative change in one's conscience; the motions of thought that arise from the deity resemble Aristotelian motion in that they involve moral change. God does not move the conscience in the spatial or the metaphorical sense, but rather causes "immediately by himself' the mind to experience certain thoughts</page><page sequence="24">304 NEW LITERARY HISTORY about its own moral well-being. The mind's "tendency" to be receptive toward certain motions is evidence of God's benevolent design. South's link between the motions of the conscience and the nature of "tropes and metaphors" has significant implications for my reading of Johnson's Dictionary revisions. While Johnson shifted "motion as thought" from the fourth to the tenth definition—thereby suggesting that readers increasingly understood this definition as metaphorical—he preserved the South quotation as an authoritative extract that argues that the motions of the mind, when "impressed" by divine intervention, are not merely figurative. That Johnson kept South's sermon as the primary authority for his definition of thought as "tendency of the mind" implies that he still recognized motion as a concept that explained moral change. Even alongside the alterations that promoted Newtonian denotations as more "natural," motion still retained its older meaning in English us age. Somewhat paradoxically, in distinguishing between rhetoric (tropes and metaphors) and pneumatology (real divine motions in the mind/ soul), South reinforces the predisciplinary connections between these two fields of study. The world causes changes in people's minds, and people's minds in turn change the world. For many Enlightenment writers, what was most at stake in these reciprocal concatenations were questions about action at a distance: pneumatological texts asked how the animal spirits transmitted motion from the material world to the immaterial mind/ soul, and rhetorical manuals asked how language could transfer emotion from writer to reader. Both fields grappled with how one thing moved another across the seemingly insurmountable gulfs between matter and spirit, God and humankind, writer and reader. This brings me back to a question that I posed at the outset, one that points to a chasm in our modern disciplinary landscape: what can a study about motion contribute to literary studies? My analysis has shown that the gravitational pull of motion as an epistemological category, while nearly nonexistent in the contemporary humanities, performed a unifying function within the structure of Enlightenment knowledge. Texts that aimed to theorize motion for lay readers mingled the Newtonian with the Aristotelian, and this interplay between modern and ancient meant that kinds of change that we now view as incommensurable—launching a cannonball and curing writer's block, centrifugal spin and moral improvement—were of a piece. It followed that, as we saw in Chambers's Cyclopcedia, natural science and moral philosophy were not separate domains. In recover ing the protodisciplinary links between pneumatology and rhetoric, we can see that what we now call literary studies shares its history with both</page><page sequence="25">breaking the laws of motion 305 psychology and physics. Indeed, as it was concerned both with action at a distance and with the ways that readers and writers moved and were moved, eighteenth-century belles lettres cannot be understood in isolation from other subjects that theorized motion.

Unfortunately, the fact that many of Johnson's periodical papers satirized "virtuosos" like Hypertatus has led some critics to presume that Johnson disapproved of the New Science. Those who read Johnson as "antiscience" tend to argue that he rejected the "vain pursuit" of natural philosophy in favour of the useful study of moral philosophy. See J. R. Philip, "Samuel Johnson as Antiscientist," Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 29, no. 2 (1975): 192-203. This kind of reading misunderstands the disciplinary landscape of the eighteenth century and, in particular, the position of pneumatology within that landscape. It is anachronistic to read Johnson's writings as "propsychology" and "antiscience" because this imposes an anachronistic disciplinary grid onto what was fundamentally a predisciplinary moment. Richard Schwartz has argued thatjohnson adopts an "all-inclusive" approach in which many fields of study are "mutually illuminating." See Schwartz, Samuel Johnson and the New Science (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1971), 54.
