<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREEK VOTIVE OFFERINGS. DR. ROUSE 1 has done what in him lies to wipe out an old reproach. It used at one time to be said that in England classical archaeology was at the mercy of dabblers and dilettanti. Indeed there are still many college lecturers, and some university professors, who look askance at the subject on the ground that it is commonly taken up by second-rate or even third-rate scholars. Theoretically, and in the abstract, they would doubtless admit that an adequate knowledge of antiquity cannot be gained without studying its external as well as its internal aspect. But they object that, as a matter of fact, those who do devote their attention to the outward remains of ancient life are not sufficiently familiar with Greek and Latin literature-they do not know their authors-and in consequence they often fail to appre- ciate the true significance of their own discoveries. Now it may be at once conceded that in the past this charge has been not altogether unfounded. One obvious proof of this is that English books on classical archaeology, books, that is, of a really scholarly character, are scarce. Our dictionaries, even the latest of them, are meagre in comparison with the great work of Daremberg and Saglio, or the yet greater work of Pauly and Wissowa. And as to sectional and particular subjects, to mention three or four at random, we can quote no English equivalent for Collignon's Histoire de la Sculpture grecque, or Bliimner's Technologie, or Furt- wingler's Steinschneidekunst, or Babelon's Monnaies de la Rjpublzque. This inferiority, everywhere manifest, is no- where more conspicuous than in the department of classical religion. To speak frankly, what English work can we put I Greek Votive Offerings, an Essay iin the History of Greek Religion, by W. H. D. Rouse, M. A. Cambridge University Press. 1902. pp. xvi., 464. 15s. net.</page><page sequence="2">Greek Votive Oferings. 261 on the same shelf with Roscher's Ausfi~krliches Lexikon, or Overbeck's Kunstmythologie, or other foreign authorities of equal calibre? What handbooks have we like those of Welcker and Preller and Gruppe? What monographs comparable with Lobeck's Aglaophamus, or Batticher's Baumkultus, or Otto Jahn's Baser Blick, or Maximilian Mayer's Gzganten und Titanen ? All this constitutes a very real reproach to English scholarship. But it is a reproach that the present generation of English scholars is doing its best to extinguish. The activity of the British Schools at Athens and at Rome, the increasing recognition accorded to archaeology by our universities, the enthusiasm of the Hellenic Society, the publication of a whole series of antiquarian manuals by Messrs. Macmillan, these are a few out of many signs that scholars are at length awaking to the importance of classical archaeology and beginning to bestir themselves in earnest. At such a juncture it is not too much to say that the credit of our national scholarship is at stake; and cordial thanks are due to those who in any department of the subject produce sound and scholarly work. That is what Dr. Rouse has done. He is indeed exceptionally well qualified to write on matters archaeolo- gical. He knows his monuments and museums; he knows also his Teubner texts; and he can thus draw upon both the sources of direct evidence, the monumental and the literary. But more than this, readers of Folk-Lore are aware that he has at his command the indirect evidence supplied by a study of survivals and of comparative religion. It was, therefore, only to be expected that his Greek Votive Oferings, the result of ten years' labour, would prove to be, what in fact it is, a thorough-going treatise of permanent value. Dr. Rouse is further to be congratulated on having settled upon an untilled and almost untouched portion of the archaeological domain. Apart from a few dictionary articles and a couple of German programs, he had the field to him-</page><page sequence="3">262 Greek Votive Oferings. self, and could plan out his property without regard to previous occupants. " In the present essay," he tells us (p vi.), "I have attempted first to set forth the facts in some convenient order, then to deduce principles from them: the only possible plan in dealing with a subject which has never been fully investigated, and where explana- tions are commonly assumed as axioms without an attempt at proof. I began my work with a few of these ready-made theories, which so impressively enunciated, seemed to be no more open to suspicion than Caesar's wife ; to my surprise, as the evidence displayed itself, I saw them drop away one by one, and since the conclusions I have been led to are very different from what I expected, I may fairly claim that they are due to no prejudice. If those who prefer the old assumptions can give reasons for their faith, I am willing to learn; the true test of my own suggestions will be, whether future discoveries will fall readily into their proper place." Here speaks a lover of truth, and one who is determined to come at it by scientific methods. His words are a sufficient rejoinder to those who complain, and some do, that his book is dull reading and reaches no very startling conclusions. It is undeniably dull to wade through a lengthy enumeration of particulars before we frame our general conception. And, when we have got it, such a conception is likely enough to look commonplace. But that is the fault of science, not of Dr. Rouse or any other honest investigator. A reviewer may be pardoned if he pursues the opposite course, and notices the results obtained before inspecting more closely the facts from which the author has started and the various lines of argument that he has followed. Chapter xiv. contains a summary, of which a brief abstract is here given. " It was," says Dr. Rouse (p. 350), " a very simple conception of the deity which suggested the votive offering. He was a being not very different from his worshipper, and likely to be pleased with a gift." The</page><page sequence="4">Greek Votive Oferings. 263 essence of such a gift is its voluntary character; indeed, Dr. Rouse defines a votive offering as "whatever is given of freewill to a being conceived as superhuman" (p. I). The gift may be customary e.g. the first fruits, or of fixed pro- portion, e.g. the tithe; but it must not be compulsory, or it becomes a tax. The motive of the giver is commonly gratitude, sometimes propitiation or prayer, very rarely fear. Dr. Rouse cites one case only of this last, a relief representing the Dioscuri, which bears the inscription (Rbhl inscrr. Gr. antiq. 62 a)- XEto-TtaCa1 fiave'rOlnKE AetLOO-KOvpotatv aryaXpa, TtvSaptaiv (sic) 3$(1o4V /J~aVtV O7rttSSJ6Vo9. " Pleistiadas dedicated me as an offering to the Dioscuri, because he feared the wrath of the twin sons of Tyndarus." From the fourth century B.C. onwards we can trace the growing influence of two other elements, which tend to rob the gift of its moral worth. One of these is compulsion on the part of the god; the other is a desire for self-advertise- ment on the part of the worshipper. Having thus determined the nature of a votive offering, and having further insisted that no limits can be set to the occasions on which such offerings may be made or to the things that may be so offered, Dr. Rouse proceeds to classify the objects that in point of fact are known to have been offered. This classification embraces "two main divisions: I. Material: things which are given for their own value; and II. Ideal: things which are given for what they imply." But we are warned that any object of the first division may on occasion be found in the second, and that the same object may be dedicated under both heads. I. The dedication of material things implies a somewhat crude conception of the deity; for they are regarded as so much payment for favours thereby secured. They include (I) such things as a god would need if he were a man. " He must, for example, have his house and grounds, with the</page><page sequence="5">264 Greek Votive Oferings. proper furniture for all uses, and beautiful things for his delight (atyAXpaTa)." This covers the temple-buildings, the precinct, votive altars, garments, etc. (2) For the maintenance and glorification of the shrine firstfruits and tithes of all sorts are required. These may be given in kind by hunters, breeders and farmers. Or they may be mineral offerings, whether ingots or manufactured articles or coins. Finally (3) " anything specially rare or precious would be an acceptable gift to a deity of like passions with the giver." Objects of this sort come under the title a/cpoOelva. II. The second and larger division stands mentally and morally on a higher level. It "may be called ideal, as meaning more than appears on the surface; and memorial, as intended to keep the god's beneficence before the mind of the man, and no less the man's piety or gratitude before the mind of the god." Thus, on the one hand, Asclepius bids an unbeliever dedicate a silver sow in memory of her stupidity (Epidaurian Cures 59, 39); and, on the other, Aceson in offering a relief to Asclepius says :-" You know why; if not, this tablet will remind you " (Anth. Pal. 6. 147). The objects presented to the god from this more advanced stand-point, where it is the thought rather than the thing that matters, are sub-divided by Dr. Rouse as follows: (I) The image of the patron deity, usually a simple copy of the cult-statue, e.g. the figures of Artemis with the fawn found in Corcyra (Bull. de corr. hell. xv. i ff.); rarely a copy of the statue modified by some attribute appropriate to the occasion, e.g. the colossus holding a ship's beak that was erected at Delphi after Salamis (Hdt. 8. 121). (2) The deity in his power, the latter being represented by some conventional attribute, e.g. Heracles with club and lionskin (Sybel, Kat. d. Skulpt. zu Athen 320, a relief from Ithome); or by some traditional attitude, e.g. Apollo seated on the oracular tripod (Sybel ib. 1389, a relief from the Athenian Pythium). (3) The</page><page sequence="6">Greek Votive Oferzngs. 265 human act blessed by tke god. In early times the artist selected some heroic precedent, which resembled as closely as might be the later human achievement. The people of Heraclea Pontica, having beaten the barbaric Mariandyni, sent to Olympia a group representing the labours of Heracles (Paus. 5. 26. 7). Next the human element begins to intrude-witness the group sent by Athens to Delphi after the Persian wars: in it along with protecting deities and eponymous heroes stood the actual commander Mil- tiades (Paus. Io. io. I). Similarly a human precedent may be added side by side with the divine prototype. " Attalus I. commemorated his Gallic victories by several groups on the Acropolis of Athens: battles of the gods and giants, of the Athenians with the Amazons, and the battle of Marathon, then held of equal importance with the great deeds of legend (Paus. I. 25. 2, Plut. v. Anton. 6o)." Attalus went further in the same direction, when he added a group representing his own victory over the Gauls (Paus. I. 25. 2). Lastly, the human and contemporary battle alone is portrayed, e.g. a cavalry skirmish on a relief at Eleusis (C.I.A. iv. I. 422, 17 p. 184). Again, the human act is often indicated by human figures so posed as to suggest it, e.g. the leaper holding his weights (Paus. 5. 27. 2), the dairyman milking his cow (Museo Italico ii. 73o, a cast bronze from Crete), women in a ritual ring- dance (Bronzen von Olympia 263), models of sacrificial pigs (7ourn. Hell. Stud. vii. 24, from Tarentum). The ritual acts most commonly depicted are the sacrifice or libation, the prayer, the dance, and the feast. A few monuments show the lepo rycd o( or ",divine marriage," e.g. a terra-cotta group from Samos of Zeus and Hera seated together as bridegroom and bride (Farnell, Cults. i. pl. v. b). The act blessed by the god is sometimes exhibited still more compendiously by a kind of ideograph. " So an ass sums up the story of a night-surprise fore- stalled by his bray (Paus. io. 18. 4). . a cicala recalls</page><page sequence="7">266 Greek Votive Of2erings. how a musician broke his string and yet won the prize (Clem. Alex. protrept. I. i. I, alib.)." A similar system of short-hand indicates what the god has done for the patient by means of anatomical models, which then as now were regularly hung in the shrines of healing powers (p. 210 ff.). (4) The prize won by the action blessed. Spoils of war were offered to the god; or, in place of objects actually captured, votive models of them-e.g. the bronze group of horses and captive women sent to Olympia by the Tarentines after a victory over the Messapians (Paus. IO. 10. 3). Under the same category come prizes won in the games and musical contests : sometimes the real prize was presented, e.g. the tripod dedicated at Dodona by a rhapsode Terpsicles (Carapanos Dodone p. 40); some- times a facsimile of it, e.g. a model tripod in stone dedicated at Tremithus by Timalcus (Collitz D. I. i. 122). So with the crowns of honour awarded to states or individuals: they were regularly dedicated by the recipient (p. 266 ff.). Craftsmen, too, offered choice samples of their work, e.g. the amphoras made by two potters of Erythrae, master and pupil, who tried to beat each other in turning out thin ware (Plin. nat. hist. 35. 46). An author might dedicate his book (Diog. Laert. 9. 6) or his poem (Bull. de corr. hell. xix. 562, alzb.). Here again models were permitted: the hunter gave a bronze hare (R6hl, I. G. A. 385); the corn- growing town, a golden sheaf (Strab. 264, Plut. de Pyth. or. 16); the engineer, a picture of his bridge (Hdt. 488); Hippocrates, the model of a corpse (Paus. 10. 2. 6) ! (5) The implement or means by which success had been at- tained. Aristomenes, who single-handed put to flight a whole Spartan regiment, dedicated his shield to Tropho- nius at Lebadea (Paus. 4. 16. 7) ; and at Olympia can still be seen the huge stone which Bybon "with one hand threw over his head " (R6hl, I. G. A. 370). Models served the same purpose, e.g. a golden anvil at Delos (Bull. de corr. hell. vi. 47, 168). Slightly different is the case of</page><page sequence="8">Greek Votive Oferings. 267 objects dedicated because their work was over, e.g. the staves piled by Xenophon's host at the place where they had first sighted the sea (Xen. anab. 4. 7. 26), or the bandage of Pandarus hung up in the precinct of the god who had healed his sores (Epidaurian Cures 3339, 53)- Different again are dedications of the clothes, etc., that have been worn at a critical time, e.g., the breast-band offered by a girl to Aphrodite (Theocr. 27. 54), or that have been used at some religious rite, e.g., the robes of the mystics at Eleusis (Eudoc. 656). Dr. Rouse concludes his classification with two miscel- laneous points. (I) The ofering of hair. His view is that it " originally (to judge from analogy) implied that the worshipper placed himself in the power of the god; but " that " in the classical age it was traditional and its meaning had been long forgotten." It was the firstfruit of the wor- shipper, and as such offered to a river, or, at a later date, to the great divinities (p. 241), especially to Hera and Zeus (p. 370). Perhaps the most interesting example of it is the series of inscriptions found by the French excavators at Panamara (= Stratonicea) in Caria (Bull. de corr. hell. xi. 390, xii. 82, 249, 479, xiv. 369 ff.). Dr. Rouse describes it as follows-" The devotees enclose their hair in a small stone coffer, made in form of a stele, which is set up in the precinct. A slab covers the hole, and an inscription is placed upon it. The poorer sort are content to make a hole in the wall, or even hang up their hair with the name only attacht. Even slaves are among the dedicators. It is peculiar that no women's names are found at all, though the inscriptions number more than a hundred; and that the deity honoured is Zeus, never Hera" (p. 243). Elsewhere the usual model is found: a votive relief from Thessaly shows two long plaits of hair dedicated by Philombrotos to Poseidon (Dar.-Sagl. s.v. " donarium" p. 376, fig. 2543)- (2) Allegorical oferings. This heading comprises not only statues of personified powers such as Victory, Good Luck,</page><page sequence="9">268 Greek Votive Oferings. Vengeance, &amp;c., and relief-figures of Initiation, Dithyramb, Good Order, but also more recondite compositions, such as the group dedicated by the Athenians at Delphi after the battle on the Eurymedon : "a palm tree of bronze, with fruit upon it, a gilt Athena and a couple of owls being apparently percht on the branches (Paus. 10. 15. 4, Plut. v. Nic. 13). This," says Dr. Rouse, modestly enough in comparison with other interpreters (see Busolt, Gr. Gesch. iii. I. 144 n.), " must surely imply that Athena and her favourite city were now possessors of the east and its riches" (p. 145). In the same allegorical vein Alcibiades dedicated on the Acropolis a picture of Nemea seated with him upon her knees (Athen. 534E, cp. Paus. I. 22. 6). The distinction that forms the basis of the foregoing classification, viz., between material and ideal offerings, is due, as the author acknowledges, to Reisch (Griech'ische Weihgeschenke, Wien, 189o, p. 5). But the elaboration and illustration of it throughout is Dr. Rouse's own, and is a very praiseworthy piece of work. It provides us for the first time with compartments into which fresh facts can be conveniently sorted. Whether the species or even the genera recognised by Dr. Rouse can be regarded as finally settled is, of course, a different matter. The subject is one that affords endless opportunities for divergence of opinion, and that on broad questions of principle as well as on points of detail. To speak of the principles first. Dr. Rouse sets aside as useless the distinction often drawn between public and private offerings, rightly remarking that the same feelings prompt both, and that both are meant to produce the same effects; hence the supposed difference is, after all, only one of degree, not of kind. The system of classification adopted and applied in detail by Dr. Rouse himself, is throughout based on logical differences; differences, that is to say, existing in the mind of the dedicator rather than in the nature of the object</page><page sequence="10">Greek Votive Oferings. 269 dedicated or in the time and place of its dedication. For this we are hardly prepared by the earlier chapters of the book, which deal successively with such topics as "War," " Games and Contests," "Disease and Calamity," " Domes- tic Life," "Memorials of Honour and Office," etc. In other words, Dr. Rouse first enumerates his materials under headings determined by differences of occasion, and then unexpectedly resumes them in a classification whose differentia are of quite another order. Nor is this all, for he adds by way of appendix alphabetical lists of votive offerings known from inscriptions found at various cult- centres-Athens, Eleusis, Delos, Thebes, Platxea, Samos, Branchida., Aegina-and in his General Index groups all dedications of the same object under one catch-word. Dr. Rouse thus presents us with classifications based on four distinct principles, viz., those of occasion, purport, provenience, and description. This to the casual reader is a little confusing, and certainly involves some tautology. But for all that it is difficult to see what else the author could have done in pioneer work of the kind. The most obvious method of classification is presumably that of place. Recent German writers on Greek religion have followed this method with conspicuous success. For example, Gruppe's admirable Grieckische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte and the excellent articles on the various divinities contained in Pauly-Wissowa's Real-encyclopiidie begin by making a local survey of the cults concerned, and are thus enabled to discover and turn to account the kindred and affinity of any particular worship. But this method, though most useful as a preliminary, does not of itself furnish generalisations and is consequently incomplete. If, discarding it for that reason, we prefer a classification based on differences of occasion, we can indeed generalise readily enough; but our generalisations will be such as appeal to the student of culture rather than to the student of cult, as may be seen from Sch6mann's Griechische Alterthitmer or</page><page sequence="11">270 Greek Votive Offerings. Bliimner's Leben u. Sitten d. Griechen. Again, classifica- tion according to description, e.g. the grouping together of all votive pigs or palm trees, or what-not, is of value to the artist, but only incidentally to the archaeologist: Thiersch's book on " Tyrrhenische" Amphoren, for instance, which collects examples of cocks and lions and palmettes from a certain class of black-figured pottery, is strictly speaking an essay in ancient art. What the historian of religion really wants to know is the inner working of men's minds, the original intention of this or that ritual practice, and its gradual growth or decay. Thus Dr. Rouse would " trace, if possible, the motives of the dedicator, and the meaning which the act had for him " (p. i). But if, in attacking a new subject, we attempt to do this straight away, we at once fall into all manner of assumptions and preconceived notions, which merely frustrate our purpose. In the cir- cumstances the only course open is to collect our materials according to some system of grouping intelligible and, if it may be, useful in itself; then, when we have formed our collection and considered it in detail, we can frame our generalisations on a sound basis. But this is precisely what Dr. Rouse has done. His readers, therefore, casual or otherwise, have no right to grumble. At least, they have no right to grumble on that score. But I think that they have on another. Dr. Rouse makes little or no use of certain great principles, which, being of world-wide validity, go far to explain the whole series of Greek votive offerings. One of these principles is that men can literally" magnify" their god. They can make a larger and more imposing statue of him, thereby bringing him more honour and at the same time increasing his power to bless. It is significant that the Greek aifow, " I increase " or " enlarge," like the Latin augeo, was often used as a synonym of " I honour." The precinct at Delos is still strewn with fragments of the gigantic statue of Apollo, which the Naxians set up. Zeus</page><page sequence="12">Greek Votive Oferings. 271 at Olympia and Athena on the Acropolis were not merely huge but sublime: Pheidias their creator could fairly claim " to have added something even to the received religion ; to such an extent did the majesty of his work rival the god- head " (Quint. 12. IO. 9.) The enormous Helios that Chares cast in sections for the Rhodians towered up 105 feet in height, and doubtless expressed the pride that the sun- worshippers felt in their pre-eminent deity: Lucian the wit makes Helios claim a front seat in heaven because of his bulk and cost (Luc. Iup. trag. I1). Other examples of Greek colossi could be quoted. But good taste imposed certain limits; and for the most part Greek artists, especially during the fine period of Greek art, eschewed extravagance in size. All the more they turned their attention to other methods of glorification. To beautify an existing statue was also a meritorious act, inasmuch as it brought fresh lustre to the deity: thus the Athenians fitted the old wooden figure of Dione at Dodona with a new and beautiful face (Hypereid. pro Eux., col. xxxv., 24 ff.). But the rank and file of Greek worshippers could neither magnify nor beautify the god. They were, therefore, content to multiply him: and this was in all probability the motive underlying not merely the row of bronze Zanes or statues of Zeus, which stood in the Altis at Olympia (Paus. 5. 21.2) and the score of Apollos sent to Delphi by the Liparaeans (Paus. Io. 16. 7), but also the innumerable terra-cotta figurines of different divinities that have been found in Greek precincts. For to present a god with his own likeness was ziso facto to increase his prestige and power. This conception would serve to explain the first two groups of " ideal" offerings recognised by Dr. Rouse, viz. " the image of the patron deity" and "the deity in his power." At least it deserves a mention; for apart from it the point and purpose of these offerings remains obscure or vague. A second principle of yet wider application may be ex- pressed thus. Unsophisticated man acts towards his god</page><page sequence="13">272 Greek Votive Offerings. as he would act towards a powerful chief. To pleasure him, he offers a gift. And here come in the "material " things that constitute the first main division of Dr. Rouse's list. The gift may be small or it may be big. In either case we call it a votive offering. But there is one kind of gift which, from a modern point of view, merits special consideration, viz. that of a human being. For the sake of distinction it should be called devotive as opposed to votive. Obviously we have here to deal with two sub-divisions: (a) the devotion of others, and (b) the devotion of oneself. Dr. Rouse does not use this nomenclature and is nowhere very clear as to the inter-relation of the facts. In his chapter on " Later Uses of the Votive Formula " he does indeed realise that the dedication of captives to the gods, whether for service or sacrifice (p. 335, cp. p. 102 f.), the emancipation of slaves by sale to a god (p. 335 f.), and the usage of ritual imprecation (p. 337 f.), are so many developments of the votive offering: i.e. he recognises sub- division (a). But apparently he is not very sure as to its connexion with his main subject; for he oddly says that "an investigation of this topic does not lie within our scope" (p. 335). More serious is his failure to recognise sub-division (b); inasmuch as that forms, or should form, the very climax of all votive offerings. What greater thing can man give to God than himself? The Greeks had no Juggernaut; but examples of self-immolation and ritual suicide are not wanting, at any rate in their mythology. Even in every- day life the existence of temple-slaves, [ip6o6vXot, etc., was a visible proof that the god, like the chief, had a body of retainers; while the right of sanctuary shows that a man might voluntarily enter his service and so secure his pro- tection. But to do this would of course be to cut himself off from ordinary civic life. Hence those who desired to honour their god by swelling the number of his retinue, and yet to escape the inconveniences attaching to a personal</page><page sequence="14">Greek Votive Oferings. 273 devotion, dedicated a carving or painting of themselves and felt that they had combined piety with practical sense. This substitute for themselves would be set up in the god's temenos and would win for the donor all the rewards of a devotee. Such, if I am right, is the root idea of that large class of votive offerings, which Dr. Rouse describes as " the human acL blessed by the god." The dairyman, for instance, virtually says " At your service ! " by dedicating the bronze figure of a man milking a cow in the precinct of his divine patron, whilst he himself continues to sell his milk to human customers outside. On this showing we might naturally expect to find numerous portraits among our dedications. But Dr. Rouse will have none of them. " Portraits," he exclaims rather dogmatically, "are out of the question, so is all idea of substitution by similitude " (p. 284). " It is true," he adds later (p. 371 f.), "that many of the examples which I have recorded have been taken by others to be portraits, but I have found no reason to believe that the portrait as such was ever dedicated by a Greek until the votive dedica- tion had lost its meaning." Dr. Rouse properly excludes such a statue as that of Miltiades in the Marathonian monument: " It makes all the difference in the world that Miltiades was part of an ideal group" (p. 372). Similarly he would, I suppose, exclude the athlete-statues at Olympia, for, though Pliny expressly states that, if a man had been thrice successful in the games, his statue was a portrait (Plin. nat. hist. 34. I6), yet it might be maintained that the -rpw-oXvtrrtoviK4 was the ideal athlete. Again, statues and pictures of priests might be ruled out of court on the ground that they "were doubtless properly characterised and . ... represented the priest's function " (p. 264), or on various other conceivable grounds. Never- theless, that ordinary worshippers dedicated their own portraits is a supposition for which the antecedent proba- bilities are so strong that I cannot accept Dr. Rouse's VOL. XIV. T</page><page sequence="15">274 Greek Votive Oferings. assertion that no such portrait exists, without asking, Why? " I take it," says Dr. Rouse, " that to dedicate a portrait as such would have seemed the height of arrogance to a Greek, as the story of Pheidias and the shield of Athena implies, and as Demosthenes implies (Dem. Aristocr. 686) in an age when the thing was common ..... It was no Greek, but the Egyptian Amasis, who sent two portraits of himself to the Argive Heraeum, and one to Cyrene (Hdt. 2. 182); it was the Asiatic Chares of Teichiusa who placed his own statue at Miletus (I.G.A. 488). These were the kind of men who would think their own image an ornament to any shrine: a peck of pride to a speck of piety" (p. 372). But why should it have been deemed the height of arrogance for a grandee to avow himself the servitor of a god? Surely the greater the grandee, the greater the honour done to the god. Had the Greeks thought otherwise, the temple officials would simply have refused to admit the portraits of Amasis and Chares. The story of Pheidias and the shield of Athena is not in point: the charge brought against the artist was not that he had dedicated a portrait of himself to the goddess, but that he had presumed to introduce his likeness into the Amazonomachia on her shield-a very different matter. The passage of Demos- thenes also misses the mark: it merely proves that the custom of honouring particular generals with a bronze statue was increasing with the individualism of the age. Dr. Rouse himself cites portrait-statues of Alcibiades, Lysander and his captains, etc., dedicated in the Heraeum (Paus. 6. 18. 2, 6. 3. 15). These he explains away as due to "colossal vanity" or as " the earliest examples of honorific statues." But he admits that "under the Solonian con- stitution the nine archons swore [in case of perjury or negligence] to dedicate a golden statue, which from the words used (Aristot. Const. Ath. 7) appears to have been meant for a portrait" (p. 315), that in the fourth century</page><page sequence="16">Greek Votive Oferings. 275 B.C. dedications of portraits sporadically occur (e.g. statues of Epaminondas, p. 269, of Lysimachus, p. 229 n. Io), and that " by the end of the fourth century we have honorific statues dedicated with all formality for trivial reasons" (p. 373). Personally, I incline to think that the virtual absence of portrait-dedications during the sixth century, their comparative rarity during the fifth, and their increas- ing frequency during the fourth, point the way to a very simple explanation. The art of portraiture demands a certain mastery over material difficulties that the early Greek sculptors and painters had not attained. Portraiture, as the handbooks tell us (e.g. Prof. E. Gardner, Gk. Sculpt. p. 450), only " came in " about the fourth century. At an earlier date realistic portraits were impossible, and at all times an ordinary worshipper would not have been able to afford the luxury of seeing his own features accurately reproduced. It was far more easy and economical to pro- cure a male or female figure with some distinguishing attribute, or a simple group, which would make the character of the dedicator sufficiently clear to the divine intelligence. This conjecture enables us to reconcile the a priori proba- bility of self-devotion with the authoritative assertion of Dr. Rouse that portraits were rarely dedicated before the Hellenistic age. And here a suspicion crosses our mind that the distinc- "tion constantly maintained in- this book between votive and honorific memorials is misleading. Dr. Rouse is sometimes at a loss to decide whether particular offerings belong to the one class or the other. Thus he says (p. 167): "When we come to the statues of athletes, we are met by a very puzzling question. The athlete, we are told, was allowed to dedicate a statue of himself for each victory; the girl runners at the Heraea, pictures of themselves painted (Paus. 5. I6. 3). The question is, whether these were really votive offerings, or nothing but an honour done to the winner." Dr. Rouse concludes "that some athlete T2</page><page sequence="17">276 Greek Votive Oferings. statues were votive and others were not" (p. 168). But is not the solution of this and kindred problems to be found in the fact that honorific statues are only an outcome or development of votive offerings? In all personal dedica- tions there is an element of honour to the dedicator as well as of honour to the deity. This element increases parz passu with the importance of the gift. Any one might offer a small terra-cotta group, but a life-size portrait was quite another thing-probably a privilege reserved for the great and good. As temple-precincts became crowded, permission to dedicate portrait-statues would be more and more restricted; a vote of the people would become necessary, and so stress would be laid upon the honorific aspect of the dedication. Greater honour still would be conferred upon public benefactors, of whom portrait-statues were erected at the public cost. Finally, the honour done to the man altogether eclipses the original notion of an offering to the god, and these statues are put up in any place of public resort. In short, we trace the following evolution :-- (a) A man dedicates his own portrait in the sacred precinct at his own expense. (b) A man is allowed by vote of the people to dedicate his own portrait in the sacred precinct at his own expense. (c) The people dedicate a man's portrait in the sacred precinct at their expense. (d) The people erect a man's portrait in some public place at their expense. But how are we to distinguish the different stages of this sequence as "votive " and " honorific " ? All are votive except, perhaps, the last. All are honorific except, perhaps, the first. Any line that can be drawn will be somewhat arbitrary. Even Pausanias, who (Paus. 5. 21. I) distinguishes stage (a) from stage (b), uses of the latter the</page><page sequence="18">Greek Votive Oferings. 277 verb (~vaTLOe'vat) appropriate to the former (p. 167). Per- haps we should be least open to criticism if we made the distinction depend on the question of locality, regarding as " votive" all statues erected in the sacred precinct,1 as "honorific" those put up elsewhere. But it might be wiser to drop the distinction altogether. Of two other principles Dr. Rouse avails himself on occasion, though he does not explicitly formulate them or give them the prominence that they deserve. One is the great canon laid down by Servius in his commentary on Aen. 2. 116 (cp. ib. 4- 512) : " in sacris simulata pro veris accipi." It may for brevity's sake be called the principle of similarity. No form of votive offering is commoner than the dedication of a model in place of the real thing. Dr. Rouse recognises models of diseased members (p.2 Ioff.), of the sacrifice whether animal (pp. 18, 296 ff.) or vegetable (p. 296), of the tithe or firstfruit (p. 66 ff.), of shrines and parts of shrines (p. 70), of tripods (pp. 145 f., 16o), shields (p. II5), &amp;c. But he ought also to have grasped the fact that the dedication of statues and statuettes involves precisely the same principle. As we have seen, to multiply figures of the god is to multiply the god himself; and to erect a votive portrait is to add to the god's retainers. The other principle to which I allude would be described by a grammarian as synecdoche. It is that principle by which we allow a part to stand for the whole. Dr. Rouse is rather chary of admitting its influence. He describes it as an " idea which is found late " (p. 211 n. I) and instances a passage of Aristeides (48. 27- 472) who tells us that the god bade him cut off a portion of his body for the salvation of the whole. "This being hard to perform he waived the matter and ordered me to draw off the ring that I was wearing and dedicate it to the god of Fulfilment. That, So Reisch, Griechische Weihgeschenke, p. 36, "Was im heiligen Bezirke aufgestellt ist, wird dadurch von selbst als Anath m gekennzeichnet," &amp;c.</page><page sequence="19">278 Greek Votive Offerings. said he, would do as well as if I were to sacrifice my finger itself." But a principle of this sort is the growth of ages, and the fact that express mention of it is late should not prevent us from using it to explain early customs. Dr. Rouse himself regards the offering of hair as the offering of a substitute for the whole person (p. 370). It is possible, therefore, that this principle enters largely into those species of dedication, which we have so far spoken of as " The prize won by the action blessed " and "the implement or means by which success had been attained." Thus the victorious choregos, when he dedicated his prize-tripod to Dionysus, not improbably regarded himself as thereby devoted to the service of the god; and the initiates, who hung up their garments at Eleusis, may have felt thence- forward that they were inmates of Demeter's sekos. I am disposed to think that these principles, that of szmilarzty and that of synecdoche, if so we may designate them, are only two manifestations of one and the same underlying idea, viz., the primitive conception or miscon- ception of personality. It is difficult even for the modern psychologist to draw a clear line of demarcation between the I and the not-I. Lotze in his Microcosmus i. 136 con- fesses as much: " We can as yet hardly say what are even the local boundaries that divide the organism from its environment. When does the air in our lungs begin to belong to us, and when does it cease to be a constituent of the body ?" If the German philosopher is thus at a loss, what can we expect of primitive man ? He regards as part of himself not only his breath, but his clothes, his weapons, his chattels, his possessions of all sorts, even his name and his likeness. Whatever touches any of these touches him. Hence the wax model of his body, the imprint of his limbs on a bed, the reflection of his face in the water, his height measured off on a string, are so many equivalents for him- self, similia pro veris. All these were, or are, used as such in Greek superstitious practices. And here we have the</page><page sequence="20">Greek Votive Oferz'ngs. 279 ultimate explanation of many, if not all, votive models. Again, the personality of the early Greek included not merely his finger, but the ring upon it; not merely his head, but the wreath that he wore; not merely his limbs, but the shield that protected them. And the dedication of these things may often have been tantamount to a dedication of himself. To pursue this far-reaching principle would be beside my purpose. But I cannot refrain from pointing out the light that it throws on the subject of magic, a subject which at more than one place overlaps that of Dr. Rouse's book. Dr. Frazer, in the second edition of his Golden Bough, i. 9f., draws a distinction between two kinds of magic, which he calls mzimetic and sympathetic respectively. The first thinks to influence the course of nature by imitating the thing desired; the second, by operating either on some portion of the person to be affected, or at least on some- thing that has been in contact with him. Both kinds of magic were well known to the Greeks. In the Pharma- ceutrz'a of Theocritus the deserted girl Simaetha recalls her lover Delphis by magical means. Among other charms she kindles a bundle of laurel boughs and speaks of them as " the bones of Delphis," whom she is fain to fire with love. She casts upon the blazing pile a shred from his cloak: this too will serve to inflame the truant's heart. Here we have both mimetic and sympathetic magic exemplified. And my point is that both depend upon the same conception of an extended personality. Semblance and clothing are alike taken to be substantial parts of the man himself. Dr. Frazer (ib. i. 62) explains these beliefs as due to association of ideas by similarity on the one hand, by contact on the other. That may well be the psychology of the matter: but the practical aspect of it is, I think, best expressed by the statement that early man gave a much wider meaning to the notion of "self " than we do nowadays in a more analytical age.</page><page sequence="21">280 Greek Votive Offerings. Before ending his book Dr. Rouse criticises two theories once much in vogue and still accepted as sound by many writers on the subject. In pp. 373-391 he investigates symbolism, or rather the application of it to votive offerings: and on p. 393 he utters a final protest against belief in any early specialisation of functions on the part of hero or god. Both points are worthy of attention; for they belong to " the old assumptions " that the author, "as the evidence displayed itself, saw drop away one by one" (p. vi.). The symbolists assume "that the attributes of a deity were regarded in some sort as representing him, and that they were dedicated to him for that reason; that Artemis, say, was specially pleased by the offering of a deer, Athena by an owl, Zeus by an axe" (p. 373 f.). Dr. Rouse in sifting this theory distinguishes between (a) animate and (b) inanimate attributes. (a) He sums up the case for the former as follows (p. 382 f.): "There is no series of attendant animals dedicated to a deity on which an argu- ment can be based. A few sporadic examples of these animals are found; but such animals dedicated to one deity generally are dedicated to one or more others. Those which can be shown to imply the idea that a deity preferred his attendant animal as a votive offering are all too late to be brought in evidence; those of which this cannot be shown are better explained on other and simpler principles. The doubtful ones cannot be proved to have been dedicated independently, and most of them are clearly parts of some- thing else. Some few, apparently old and genuine, remain unexplained, such as the crows and the owl of Athens, which stand on independent bases (Ridder, Cat. des Bronzes 541-543, 434). I will grant these to the symbolists; to build up a reversed Chinese pagoda, on a point supported by three crows and one obscure bird of night." Dr. Rouse really grants rather more than this, viz. that occasionally before and more frequently after " the great dividing line of the fourth century " (p. 375) we do find the dedication of</page><page sequence="22">Greek Votive Offerings. 281 attendant animals (pp. 374 f., 380 ff.). He denies, however, if I have understood him aright, that any animal thus dedicated was symbolic, i.e. "an equivalent Tor the deity himself" (p. 380), and explains them as models of prey or gain, toys, &amp;c. Dr. Rouse's collection of facts, here as elsewhere, is most valuable. But it may be questioned whether the inference that he has drawn from them is the whole truth. There is a vast amount of evidence for the prevalence of animal-worship in early Greece, and hardly a Greek divinity who was not fabled to have adopted one or more animal disguises, see e.g. M. W. de Visser de Graecorum diis non referentibus specz'em humanam, 1900oo, pp. 129-165. The attendant animal, whose nature, as Dr. Rouse says (p. 40), was often determined by the local fauna, is merely the favourite animal disguise or animal shape of the god. Pious folk anxious to increase his prestige might well dedicate votive figures of it. For example, the Athenian Acropolis, where stood Athena's temple, was once, and indeed still is, frequented by owls; hence the owl came to be looked upon as the " attendant " of the goddess, who, as the epithet ryXav6cc^mrt goes far to prove, was at some early date thought to appear as an owl herself. Now the lists of Athena's treasure mention no less than ten owls (C. I. A. ii. 678 B 76, 706 B 3), besides "a little silver owl on a small column" (ib. 735, 33)- What are these but likenesses of the divine animal- a virtual multiplication of the goddess ? Dr. Rouse objects (p. 380) that "we should expect not a few, but whole series of such dedications." I do not think so. Anthropo- morphism had long since set in, and Athena, even in Homeric days, was normally conceived as a goddess, not a bird. Consequently those of her worshippers who desired to do her honour would seldom repeat the old animal shape. That such repetitions become more common in and after the fourth century is probably due to that universal phenomenon, the recrudescence of primitive ideas</page><page sequence="23">282 Greek Votive Offerings. in an age of decadence, the second childhood of religion. (b) Inanimate attributes, according to Dr. Rouse, are with but few exceptions (thyrsus, aegis, thunderbolt) " things of every day: club, bow, and spear, or battleaxe, helmet and shield; travelling boots, hats conical or flat; fawnskin or lionskin; sheaves of corn, a bunch of grapes; torches, hunting-spear or harpoon. They are, in fact, simply the properties of a character costume " (p. 376). They " do not distinguish one deity from another" (p. 377), and merely mark the fact that the god bearing them is at the moment discharging a certain definite r6le. The same r'le may be taken by a second or third god; and the first god may take a different role. Dedications of these objects are not, therefore, symbolic. Rather, we should recognise in them spoils of war, firstfruits, thank-offerings for healing, &amp;c. Again one feels that Dr. Rouse has somewhat overshot the mark. After all, the trident does commonly distinguish Poseidon, the caduceus Hermes, &amp;c., though these articles are sometimes borne by others. Nevertheless Dr. Rouse has shown that there is during the Hellenic period no clear case of the dedication of such an object in a symbolic sense. But this is hardly to be won- dered at. For inanimate attributes, being in the nature of arms, tools, clothes, and the like, are not quite on the same footing with the animal form of the god. If in any case the inanimate object was thought to be the outward embodiment of the god, there we might expect to find the symbolic dedication of it. Now there are at least two such objects, the aegis or palladium and the thunderbolt. And it is precisely here that our evidence of symbolic dedication is strongest. Dr. Rouse apparently admits it in and after the fourth century B.C., citing (p. 384) the gold aegis dedicated above the theatre in Athens by Antiochus (Paus. 5. 12. 4) and (p. 379) the gilded thunderbolt of forty cubits in length that was carried in the procession of Ptolemy (Athen. 202 c). "To the thunderbolt," he says (p. 376), " were</page><page sequence="24">Greek Votive Oferings. 283 paid divine honours in Seleucia, and in the Hellenistic age (App. bell. Syr. 58) ; it may be in Arcadia (Collitz i. I197) and Olympia (Paus. 5. 14. 9) at an earlier date." In the Hellenic period we should least expect to find the symbolic dedication of an attribute; because, as I have already observed, anthropomorphic conceptions of the god were then paramount. But in pre-Hellenic times we might reasonably look for the dedication of such inanimate attributes as were thought to embody a deity. And we find them. Sieveking in Roscher's Lexikon d. Mythologie iii. 1327, 51 ff. contends with much probability that " auch der mykenische Schild allein als Kult-symbol verehrt wurde," and the brilliant discoveries of Mr. Arthur Evans in Crete have proved that the double-axe was often dedicated as sign and symbol of the sky-god Zeus. Dr. Rouse is still incredulous 1 (see his article in _7ourn. Hell Stud. xxi. 268 ff.) and prefers to explain the miniature shields found at Olympia (Bronzen von Olympia nos. oo2-10oo5) and in Crete (Annual of Brit. Sch. Ath. vi. 109), and the miniature double-axes of the Dictaean Cave (ib. vi. io8) and of Olympia (Bronzen von Olympia pl. xxvi. 520, 525, 527), as units of currency. This no doubt is conceivable, and Dr. Rouse has no difficulty in adducing parallel customs. But the connexion of the Mycenaean shield with Athena is far too intimate to be thus disregarded; and to say that " the axe has no special connexion with Zeus " (p. 386 f.) is not only to misinter- pret much evidence from every side of the Aegean, but to ignore Mr. Chadwick's proof that the hammer or axe is the weapon of the thunder-god throughout most of the Indo- Perhaps the persuasive words of M. Salomon Reinach will carry convic- tion: " Qui pourra refuser de voir des symboles dans les belles haches de jadeite, de chloromelanite, de fibrolithe ? On a decouvert '&amp; Troie, mais non encore publi6, une merveilleuse hache double en lapis-lazuli, qui n'a jamais pu servir qu'a titre d'objet de culte" (L'Anthropologie, 1902, p. 24). The magnificent double-axe, or rather axe-hammer, to which M. Reinach refers, has since been published in Dirpfeld's Tri-ja und Ilion, i., 375, fig. 326.</page><page sequence="25">284 Greek Votive Oferings. Germanic-speaking peoples of Europe (Journ. Anthr. Inst. 1900, p. 22 ff.). Much more convincing is Dr. Rouse's final paragraph. " In taking a last look backwards it is impossible not to feel with a new force how little there is in early times of the specialization of functions. The local deity or hero was lookt to for help in all emergencies, and all sorts of offerings might be paid to him" (p. 393). The British public has indeed been told so often that the Greek gods were nothing but abstractions of human qualities-Athena abstract wisdom, Ares abstract courage, Aphrodite abstract love-that they have got to regard it as an axiom. Even the Germans have helped to perpetuate this notion. Zeller in his History of Greek Philosophy i. 54 says: " Not only is the outer form of the gods idealised as the image of the purest beauty, but their essential nature, especially in the case of the Hellenic gods proper, is formed by ideals of human activities." Nothing could be more misleading than this; and it is the logical outcome of the " specialization " theory, against which Dr. Rouse raises his voice. I have left but little space for comment on the series of interesting chapters, in which Dr. Rouse collects and arranges his materials. They are full of happy thoughts and shrewd observations hidden away in the mass of accu- mulated facts. I must content myself with noting a point here and there. The heroised pair on early Greek funeral reliefs is " dis- tinguished by being larger in size than the human adorers " : Dr. Rouse quotes an apt illustration in a marionette show that he saw in India " representing the siege of Delhi; in which the English general was twice the size of his men, and the Great Mogul within towered high over the walls of his citadel " (p. 5, n. 4). He might also have added a refe- rence to Iliad 18. 519 g JP 9 &amp;ptjXw, Xao0 8' v7r' Xlifovc9 On p. 12 f. Dr. Rouse suggests that the "deserted</page><page sequence="26">Greek Votive Offerings. 285 chapels " or " outside chapels" of modern Greece "may often stand on the site of a hero-shrine, or some farmer's chapel sacred to Pan or Demeter." This is highly pro- bable, and we are grateful for the list of " modern repre- sentations of ancient shrines" given on p. 37 f. There is indeed scope for much further investigation in the same direction, viz. the tracing of classical cults through Byzantine and mediaeval into modern times. The efforts that have been already made by Prof. W. M. Ramsay, Prof. J. Rendel Harris, and a few others have proved very successful. Dr. Rouse justly lays stress on the antiquity and im- portance of hero-worship. But, when he concludes that "we have here a system of worship which was older than the great gods " (p. II) and suggests that the cult e.g. of Zeus was post-Pelasgian (p. 12), that the chthonian deities " really are deified ancestors" (p. 13), that "Hades or Pluto has more of the heroic than the divine about him " (p. 28), &amp;c., &amp;c., it is high time to dissent. The Zeus of Dodona, whose cult shows the clearest traces of a hoary antiquity, was invoked by Achilles as " Pelasgian" (Iliad 16. 233). His worship is derived by Strabo from a Pelas- gian district of Thessaly (Strab. 329). It flourished, more- over, among various branches of the Pelasgian stock in North Greece, Central Greece, South Greece, the Islands, North Africa, and Asia Minor. How can it then be main- tained that Zeus was a post-Pelasgian importation ? It is far more probable that the Pelasgians venerated not only their deceased ancestors, whence arose hero-worship, but also the powers of nature, a sky-god Zeus, a water-god Poseidon, an earth-god Hades, not to mention the minor deities of hills and woods and springs. So, and so only, will Greek religion be brought into line with that of all other Indo-European peoples (see e.g. Schrader, Real-lexikon der Indogermanz'schen Altertumskunde, s.v. "Religion," an article that no student of classical religion can afford to neglect). The question is too large to be argued out here:</page><page sequence="27">286 Greek Votive Oferings. but many will sincerely regret that Dr. Rouse has lent his support to the untenable position that in Greek religion the great gods were sometimes developed out of local heroes. In no case can that be proved; in no case is it even fairly probable.' Yet from Dr. Rouse's first chapter one would think that man becomes hero, and hero becomes god, much as the undergraduate becomes in turn a bachelor and a master of arts. In his chapter on "Tithes, Firstfruits, and Kindred Offerings," Dr. Rouse truly remarks that it is Alexandrine literature which, despite its artificiality, best enables us to supplement our scanty knowledge of the Greek farmer and his ways. " There needs a reaction from city life, and the self-conscious art of a later age, to suggest that rustic merrymakings are worth describing" (p. 43.) Hence, throughout his book he has drawn largely and wisely upon such sources as the Palatine Anthology, the Bucolic Poets, the Romance-writers, &amp;c. Equally successful are his re- ferences to modern Greek folklore-the mysterious Neraidh- es (p. 49), the communion feast of the panegyris (p. 49 f.), the plaited corn-maiden (p. 50), the gilded joints of meat (p. 255), the votive models in silver (pp. 237 f., 257), the binding-spells (p. 340), and so on. Here Dr. Rouse's fami- liarity with modern Greece stands him in good stead. One could wish for more, e.g. that, when mentioning the belief in the evil eye (p. 44 n. 6), he had also recorded the belief in the good eye; Prof. P. Gardner once gave me some details about it in conversation. It is perhaps going too far to say that " there is no mean- ing in dedicating the statue of one god to another, except it be dedicated as a work of art or a thing of value" (p. 64). Dr. Rouse collects examples of such dedications (pp. 391- I The nearest approach to a probability is reached in the cases of Asclepius and Heracles. But other explanations are here to be preferred; and, even if they were not, these two personages can hardly be said to belong to " the great gods" of Greece.</page><page sequence="28">Greek Volive Oferings. 287 393) and concludes that they were all offered as a'yd`Xqara, beautiful and costly objects. " I can find no authority " he says, " for the dedication of one deity as a deity to another until very late times ". .. " These are an extension of the vicious idea which brought honorific statues into the temples " (p. 392). I would suggest for Dr. Rouse's con- sideration the possibility that the dedicator meant rather to subject, so far as he could, this, that or the other divinity to his own patron-god. Somewhat in favour of this is the fact that, although a variety of gods is devoted to Zeus, Zeus himself is apparently never devoted to another god: he was ex hypothesi supreme. The golden Zeus dedicated at Olympia (Dr. Rouse on p. 126 says " Delphi " by a slip of the pen) by Cypselus stood in the temple of Hera (Suid. and Phot. s.v. KvqeXtLoAv e avalypa), presumably as a worthy mate for the goddess. A very ingenious and probably correct explanation of an Athenian puzzle is offered at p. 75. In the list of the Chalcothece (C. I. A. ii. 721, I5) occurs an odd entry of twenty-one golden letters. " Could this," says Dr. Rouse, "be the old Athenian alphabet (A B r A E Z H O I K A M N 0II P = T T D X), dedicated when Euclides changed the official script in 403 ? " On p. 354 the famous Delphic conundrum is mentioned: " When Livia dedicated the golden E at Delphi, and probably when the Athenians dedicated theirs of bronze, they simply gave what were meant as ornaments to the sanctuary. What the original wooden E was, who offered it, and why, we have no means of knowing." Some years ago I ventured to propound a view, which Dr. Rouse duly records, viz., that the Delphic E was a sacred relic, being in fact the head of Poseidon's trident. I may here be allowed to add a word or two in support of that view. The sanctuary had at one time be- longed to Poseidon, whose altar still stood in it (Paus. Io 24. 4). If, then, one relic of Poseidon-cult survived in the temple, why not another? The original E was of wood,</page><page sequence="29">288 Greek Votive Oferings. because an early statue of Poseidon must have been a wooden xoanon. And for the preservation of the trident- head without the shaft attached compare the numerous Greek coins of Corinth, Leucas, Mantinea, Troezen, &amp;c., on which Poseidon is symbolised by his trident-head alone. A theory which Dr. Rouse does not record, but which is at least as deserving of notice, is that as Mr. A. H. Smith. He suggested once to me that the mystic E might possibly be explained by the resemblance that it bears to the MT shaped window or smoke-hole over the door of hut-urns from Etruria (e.g. Dar.-Sagl., ii. 349, fig. 2508). This would suit Pausanias' statement that the first temple at Delphi was a hut of laurel-boughs (Paus. 10. 5- 9), and perhaps accounts for the dedication of the E in the pronaos. But, as Dr. Rouse says, "we have no means of knowing." There are two or three omissions in the chapter on "War" that might be supplied in a future edition. A propos of the trophy (p. 99) there is no discussion of the theory that it was an actual image of Zeus Tp6drato9: yet there is much to be said in favour of that view (see P. Wagler Die Eicke in alter und neuer Zeit ii. 20ff.) ; indeed the trophy is definitely called " an image of Zeus" by Euripides (Phoen 1250 f. ZVYb4...tp&amp;pa, 7Tporratov). Again, no mention is made at p. 103 of naval trophies in the Homeric age. Yet such there certainly were. For the tail-piece, which towered over the poop of a Homeric ship (Iliad 9. 241 ~cpa lc'pv.0,a), seems to have been regarded as inviolable (Iliad 15. 716f. AXaoarov, " not to be broken off," from a+pX~wc=Okdw): to lop an enemy's tail-piece was to secure a trophy (Iliad 9. 241). Dr. Rouse recognises the custom for a later age at p. 133. The lion of Chaeronea and similar dedications are dealt with on p. 144: they are not, however, mere symbols of courage, as the text states, but survivals of the very ancient custom of carving lions to mount guard over the entrance to tombs (see 7ourn. Hell. Stud. xiv. xiv. o09 f.).</page><page sequence="30">Greek Votive Oferings. 289 With the dedication of poems by Hesiod, Alcaeus, &amp;c. (p. 64), should be compared Pindar's hymn dedicated in the Libyan Ammonium (Paus. 9. 16. I.) For sacred oil given as a prize to athletes (p. 154) see also the gymnasi- arch's oil-basin represented on coins of Anazarbus, Coly- brassus, and Syedra (Brit. Mus. Cat. Gk. Coins, Lycaonia &amp;c. pp. xxxiv., xxxvi). The name on the bronze quoit from Cephallenia (p. 16o) should probably be read 'EXaot8a, i.e. 'Egot8a(9), not Eiao18a(9), as I have shown in the Classical Review xiii. 78. At p. 165 Reisch's explanation of the small votive wheels found at Argos, Dodona, Lusi, and Olympia, viz., that they represent complete cars, is rightly rejected. But Dr. Rouse's own theory, viz. that they may have been a kind of currency (p. 390), is hardly more probable. Bertrand in his La Religion des Gaulois gave strong grounds for believing that the solar disc was often represented as a single wheel in gold or bronze or lead (ib. pl. xxii): the "rota Solis" is mentioned in the myth of Prometheus (Serv. ecl. 6. 42) and figured on coins of Mesembria. It is possible, therefore, that some or all of these votive wheels may be solar in character. Dr. Rouse refuses (p. 191 n. 8) to identify the inscribed basis C.I.A. i. 335, which still stands on the Acropolis, with that of the statue dedicated to Athena Hygieia by Pericles, on the ground that the former was set up by the Athenian people, the latter by Pericles himself. This is a point which deserves careful consideration at the hands of our topo- graphers, who accept the identification as beyond dispute (e.g. Frazer, Pausanias ii. 277 ff.; E. Gardner, Ancient Athens p. 244 f; Miss J. Harrison, Monuments and Mythology p. 389 ff). In the chapter on " Domestic Life " Dr. Rouse, relaxing his usual caution, admits one or two far-fetched explanations, e.g. that the gold figure of a baker-woman dedicated at Delphi by Crcesus, whose life she had saved, was "his queen perhaps," her attitude having been mis- interpreted by the local authorities (p. 255), or that the so- VOL. XIV. U</page><page sequence="31">290 Greek Vot'ive Oferings. called " mourning Athena " of the Acropolis " is really," as Lechat argued, " a dedication to her as nursing mother," the child's figure on the relief having been painted in and so in time obliterated (p. 256). Under the head of " Rarities and Valuables " Dr. Rouse includes a very miscellaneous assortment of relics, ranging from an odd-shaped shell found at Delphi to mammoth-tusks preserved at Tegea as those of the Calydonian boar! But it is a little misleading to include in this collection of mere curios the stone of Cronus, the pillar of Oenomatis, and the sceptre of Agamemnon; for these were, or had been, the objects of actual worship. Dr. Rouse spares two chapters to votive formulae, which are carefully classified and illustrated. He tells us that " the verb avarTiyt .... and its derivative advcd67Oqa are universal for the votive offering" (p. 323), but that in ritual imprecations " the curse itself is sometimes called ica7rdaeua (Def. tab., p. xxiii.), a curious opposite of 1ava O ea, quite appropriate to the buried lead " (p 338 f.). This suggests that the original force of avar7iTy, was " I hang up " or " dedicate on high," i.e. I offer to a deity of the upper world, whereas Kara8riOypa meant " I place down " or "dedicate below," i.e. I offer to a deity of the under world. 'Avz6ea and IcaardcteWa would thus be offerings dispatched to the di superi and the dz zinferi respectively. The former would naturally be hung on walls and ceilings or placed high up on a pedestal (7ourn. Hell. Stud., xxii. 27 f.); the latter, cast into a pit or buried underground. In conclusion, it may without injustice to Dr. Rouse besaid that the chief, though by no means the only, value of his book lies in its admirable collection of facts. Where he generalises, he is sometimes successful, sometimes unsuccessful: where he particularises, he is always to the point. Finality in a work of this sort is, fortunately for posterity, unattainable. Doubtless the next writer on the subject will include the remarkable series of votive offerings just discovered by Drs.</page><page sequence="32">Greek Votive Oferings. 29I Blinkenberg and Kinch near the temple of Athena at Lindos (Berliner Philologische Wochenschrift, Juli 25, 1903, col. 958 f.) and the latest instalment of Cretan terra-cottas found by Messrs Evans and Bosanquet (Annual of Brit. Sck. Ath., viii. I ff., 27I ff.) But Dr. Rouse will have the satisfaction of knowing that his book will certainly be read with profit for many years to come. To borrow his own terminology, he has made, if not an " ideal," at least a very "material" offering to the classic Muse. ARTHUR BERNARD COOK. U2</page></plain_text>
