<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RIJAH HAKODESH IN TANNAITIC LITERATURE BY RABBI HERBERT PARZEN, Portland, Oregon BEFORE the attempt is made to define and explain the meaning and the significance of the term "Rual Hakodesh" in Tannaitic Literature, a few preliminary observations are necessary. First, what type of men are deemed worthy to experience and to come in contact with the Ruab Hakodesh? Secondly, in what lands does it inspire and influence men? Thirdly, in what epochs of Jewish history is it chiefly at work and functioning? It may be regarded as axiomatic that not every individual is privileged to enjoy the Ruab Hakodesh, not even every religious individual. Only outstanding, saintly characters may experience it. Men who have assiduously disciplined themselves in virtuous living, are proper subjects for its influence. It is a rare and therefore a precious Divine gift to people who have progressively improved themselves spiritually. As Rabbinic phraseology puts it: "Zeal brings man into a state of cleanliness, cleanliness advances man to purity, purity leads man to self-control, self-control to holiness, holiness to humility, humility to fear of sin, fear of sin to godliness, godliness makes man worthy of the Ruah Hakodesh . .."I Thus, only a deeply religious personality, a saint (Hasid) who has rigidly disciplined himself, may experience this godly favor. The early Rabbinic practice to earn a livelihood by means of some handicraft or business and not from scholar- I Mishnah Sotah 9, 15. 51</page><page sequence="2">52 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ship, is highly extolled. Thus the Ruab Hakodesh "rests on Elisha only because of work . . .2 This concept miti- gates and modifies the austere, ascetic tendency of the first statement. By godliness is not meant mere other- worldliness. Work, too, is a prerequisite for the saint. Thus these two haggadic dicta complement and supplement each other. There is yet another class of men who are suitable candi- dates for the experience of the Ruah Hakodesh. Men of strong and sincere faith in God are fit to feel its influence. Thus Israel, as a whole, may enjoy the Ruab Hakodesh as a reward for their complete faith and trust in God. The Patriarchs are considered worthy of this Divine privilege because of their faith.3 As one Rabbi explains, even "he who takes upon himself the performance of one "Mitsvah" in faith (be'emunah) may be rewarded with the gift of the Ruah Hakodesh.3 However, since faith in God is the "sine qua non" of the religious character, this concept is simply a complementary corollary to the class of men already enumerated on whom the Ruah Hakodesh may be bestowed. The ethical prerequisite for the enjoyment of the Ruab Hakodesh is even still more far-reaching. Not only must the immediate subject who realizes the Ruah Hakodesh be thoroughly ethical, but the environment of the personality must also be essentially moral and spiritual. The Ruab Hakodesh will only manifest itself to the deserving principal when he is in a deserving environment. Let us utilize the words of the Rabbis to bring this point into bolder relief. "Wherefore did the Ruah Hakodesh manifest itself in the Portion of Benjamin?" the Rabbis ask.4 "Because all the tribal forbears were present at the sale of Joseph, but Midrash Tannaim (ed. Hoffmann), p. 22. 3 Mekilta-Beshallab (n6va). 4 The Temple stood in part in Benjamite territory.</page><page sequence="3">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 53 Benjamin was not" is their answer.5 The view of the Tannaim is, then, that the Ruah Hakodesh is only realized by industrious, virtuous, religious and saintly men in a proper background. This brings us directly to the second point. In what land does the Ruah Hakodesh make its appearance to influence men? The Rabbis did not agree on this matter. Some held that before the sanctification of Palestine (Erets Israel) all lands were fit for Speech (with God)-Divine Revela- tion. But after its sanctification, God revealed Himself to His prophets, outside of Palestine, on the seas only. As proof of this the case of Jonah is cited. Rabbi Judah believed that at no time did God reveal Himself to men outside of Palestine except on the seas. He cites for his proof Ezekiel 1.3 (the repetition of the verb Trn). Rabbi Nehemiah, utilizing the same evidence, argued that at first God did reveal Himself everywhere. "But," he adds, "the Ruah Hakodesh did not remain constant in these lands."6 In order to understand the issue involved in this differ- ence of opinion, we must bear in mind that Palestine is the Holy Land. Therefore it is the proper place for Revelation. Foreign lands, are, from the Rabbinic viewpoint, "impure," consequently, not suitable for Divine Revelation. The sea is "pure," therefore, appropriate for this purpose. This divergence of opinion refers only to extra-Palestinian do- mains. As far as Palestine itself is concerned, there is implicit as well as explicit unanimity that it is the land "par s Mekilta, Jethro (rnn). 6 See Rashi, Kimti, Targum Jonathan on Ezekiel 1. 3. Targum Jonathan has an additional view, namely, the prophet who experienced the Ruah Hakodesh outside of Palestine, does so only because he had already enjoyed that privilege in the Holy Land proper. Because he had been worthy of that honor in Palestine is he vouchsafed it outside of its borders. Thus Ezekiel prophesies in Babylonia because he had prophesied in Palestine before the exile. With regard to the Isaiah of the Exile, this view had no difficulty, because the entire book was regarded as the work of the Palestinian prophet.</page><page sequence="4">54 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW excellence" where the Ruah Hakodesh may make itself felt and make its appearance among men. Other lands may serve temporarily as its appropriate abode. But Palestine is the constant, permanent and abiding home, as it were, of the Ruah Hakodesh. Its field of activity, territorially, is further limited and concentrated in Jerusalem, in the Portion of Benjamin, because of its greater sanctity and holiness. Why? "Because all the tribal Patriarchs were born on foreign soil (IHuts Laarets) while Benjamin was born in the Land of Israel," the Rabbis conclude.7 It is safe, therefore, to generalize and to state that the holier the domain, the more suitable, the more proper, and the more appropriate it is to serve as the background for the Ruah Hakodesh. In such an environment the Ruah Hako- desh appears more frequently and more constantly. It is in fact the divinely favored surrounding for the Ruah Hakodesh. Thus it is in accord with our previous generali- zation that the Ruab Hakodesh is experienced by saintly men in a suitable holy environment. Now for the third question: In what periods of Jewish history was the Ruah Hakodesh most active? Generally speaking, there were two momentous ages which may be regarded as landmarks in the prevalence of the Ruah Hakodesh in Israel's midst. Up to the time of the "Ascension" of Elijah, the Rabbis believed, the Ruab Hakodesh was experienced by Israel most frequently. With his "secretion" a diminution set in which reached its climax with the death of the last three prophets, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi. With their demise the Ruah Hakodesh also passed away.8 This conception of the disappearance of the Ruah Hako- desh from Israel's world is in full harmony with the Rabbinic 7 Mekilta, Jethro (lnn). 8 Tosefta, Sotah 12, 5 and 13, 2.</page><page sequence="5">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 55 view of Biblical Israel. The Rabbis conceived the Biblical era as practically perfect from the religious viewpoint. And this perfection decreased as the Biblical epoch approached nearer and nearer its end. Therefore, the Ruah Hakodesh and consequently, prophecy, disappear when the Biblical period of Jewish history ends. Why do these Golden Centuries end? the Rabbis wonder. They come to the conclusion that it is due to the fact that Israel no longer merited to realize and to experience the Ruab Hakodesh because of their sinfulness. One Rabbi explains that God spoke to Moses as well as to all the other prophets only because Israel merited this godly boon. To put it in his own words: "Not only with Moses alone did (God) speak because of the merit of Israel but all the prophets were spoken to by God as a result of the merit of Israel."9 After he proves his statement from the experi- ences of Baruch ben Neriah, the disciple of Jeremiah, he exclaims: "Thus you may conclude that under no circum- stances did prophets prophesy but because of the merit of Israel." This idea is carried out to its logical conclusion. For we find a Haggadah relating'these incidents: "When the Sages entered the house of Guryo at Jericho, they heard the Bath Kol (the Heavenly Voice) announce "One man is present here who is worthy of the Ruah Hakodesh but his generation is not worthy of it . . ." "At another time the Sages were in session in Jabneh and they heard the "Bath Kol" announce, "There is one man present in this conclave who is worthy of the Ruab Hakodesh but his generation is unworthy of it."Io These legends clearly state that the reason the Ruah Hakodesh was not bestowed upon Hillel the Elder, and 9 Mekilta, Bo (mt). o1 Tosefta, Sotah 13, 3.</page><page sequence="6">56 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Samuel the Small (Shemuel Hakaton), was because of the unworthiness of their generations, though they themselves were deserving of the honor. Here is simply reiterated from another angle the concept that a favorable religious milieu must exist in addition to saintly men for the Ruab Hako- desh to appear. It is therefore fair to conclude, that while there was a general decrease in the purposive activity of the Ruab Hakodesh marked by the death of Elijah and the three last prophets, the underlying cause of the diminution and the final disappearance of the Ruah Hakodesh was the unworthiness of Israel, the sinfulness of Israel. To recapitulate: The Ruah Hakodesh is experienced only by saintly, godly men in a holy virtuous environment, preferably Palestine. The Biblical centuries supplied the necessary favorable background because of Israel's perfec- tion. With the decrease in Israel's perfection, the Ruah Hakodesh diminished its activity. The climax was reached at the end of the Biblical era, with the death of the last three prophets, when the Ruah Hakodesh completely ceased to function. I now proceed to discuss the meaning of the phrase, Ruab Hakodesh. This term, in Tannaitic literature, may be said to fall into two chief categories. Each category contains a distinctive singular connotation. In one the Ruah Hakodesh represents God. God is the active agent. He is the centre of attention. In the other, the Ruah. Hakodesh denotes inspiration. And man has the centre of the stage. Man is the focus of attention. Man holds the important position, in the sense that the Ruah Hako- desh is for him. The first definition which it will be attempted to establish is that the Ruah Hakodesh is a synonym for God, denoting the Spirit of Scripture." In this instance we deal with I Dr. Schechter refers to this connotation as the "Word of God."</page><page sequence="7">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 57 dramatization of Biblical verses, or series of verses, in which Israel, or, a Biblical hero, or heroine, recites part of a verse, or an entire verse, and the Ruah Hakodesh- God, the Spirit of Scripture-responds by quoting the re- mainder of the same verse, or a neighboring verse. For example: "Under the apple tree I awakened thee. There thy mother was in travail with thee ..." Thus far the Ruah Hakodesh speaks. The Congregation of Israel con- tinues, "Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm." The Gentile nations conclude, "For love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave." (Canticles 8. 5-6). " It is quite clear that the Ruah Hakodesh can here refer only to God. It is a Representative of God-the Greek Logos. Let us examine more minutely the purposes of these dramatizations. The reason for one series of conversations is to exchange complimentary laudations between Israel and God. For instance, commenting on Ex. 15. 3, "The Lord is my strength and my song," the Rabbis utilize the oppor- tunity to illustrate the close relationship which exists between God and Israel by an exchange of compliments, as it were. "Israel declares (God's unity) 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.'" And the Ruah Hako- desh proclaims, "Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like thee?" Israel affirms, "Who is like the Lord our God" and the Ruah Hakodesh responds, "For what great nation is there that hath God so nigh?" Israel speaks: "For Thou art the Glory of their strength . . ." (Ps. 89. 18) and the Ruah Hakodesh returns "0 Israel, in whom I become glorified. "3 12 Tosefta, Sotah 9, 9. I3 Midrash Tannaim, p. 221. Also Sifre (ed. Friedman), p. 148a and parallels. These complimentary dialogues occur very frequently in Midrashic literature.</page><page sequence="8">58 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Another aim of these dialogues is to explain certain definite Biblical passages. As for example, why did God ask Moses to appoint Joshua his successor during the former's lifetime. The Ruah Hakodesh commands Moses, "Appoint unto Joshua a Meturgeman (an interpreter) that he (Joshua) may discuss, lecture and act as Judge during your lifetime so that when you die, Israel shall not say to him, 'You, during your Master's lifetime, did not speak, and now you are speaking!' "I4 In other words, to lend prestige to Joshua was the aim of this passage, according to the Rabbis. Joshua derives his authority direct from Moses. In a sense it is a formal ordination (Semikah). Moreover, the same method of interpretation is utilized to emphasize the implicit morality of Biblical heroes. Judah, when he realizes that he had illicit relations with Tamar his own daughter-in-law, acknowledges his sin by confessing "She is more righteous than I . .. " Then the following clause, "And he knew her no more," is attributed to the Ruah Hakodesh.15 Thus, Judah is completely exonerated from any intentional wilful wrongdoing. In the case of David, however, who consciously and intentionally violated the moral law, the Ruah Hakodesh is made to censure him. The Rabbis meditating on the verse, "He (David) lifted up his spear against eight hun- dred whom he slew at one time" (II Sam. 23. 8), say that he was short of two hundred by paraphrasing the Scrip- tural verse (Deut. 32. 36) "Behold one of us pursueth a thousand of the heathen and two of us make ten thousand to flee." Why? The Ruah Hakodesh explains, "Because of the foul deed done to Uriah the Hittite."I6 The Ruah Hakodesh-God, the Scriptural Spirit-explains why David was weakened-Sin caused this weakening. '4 Sifre, Deuteronomy, p. 305. '5 Tosefta, Sotah 9, 3. Also Sifre, p. 24a. I6 Midrash Tannaim, p. 199.</page><page sequence="9">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 59 Again, the Ruah Hakodesh, as a synonym for God, in similar excerpts, teaches the proper Halakah. The verse in Malachi (2. 5) "and he feared Me and was afraid of My name" is applied by the Rabbis to Aaron on the occasion of his consecration with the anointing oil. He thought that he made improper use (me'ila) of this oil. Then the Ruah Hakodesh consoled him by reciting Psalm 133 and by concluding, "Just as dew has no inappropriate use so has oil no improper use."I7 The Rabbis have the same end in view in the dramatiza- tion of the verses (Deut. 21..1-9) which deal with the ceremony of the "Eglah Arufah." They argue that there was no need for the statement, "And the blood shall be forgiven them." So they conclude that the Ruah Hakodesh informs Israel that when they perform this ceremony as described in Scripture, the blood of the slain man will be forgiven them. Here, too, the Ruah Hakodesh is utilized to teach the proper law, namely, that this rite must be performed if forgiveness is to ensue.'8 The Ruah Hakodesh is also made the vehicle for the justification of Divine punishment. The parable of Doeg ben Joseph, as told by the Rabbis, is utilized for this pur- pose. He was a very wealthy man. When he died, he left an only son who was slaughtered by the hands of his own mother for food during the siege of Jerusalem. Thus illus- trating the truth of the godly warning in Leviticus 26. 29: "And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat" (when Israel will reject God and His Torah). Jeremiah, in Lamentations (2. 20) is made to say (the Rabbis do not interpret the verse as a question) "Women eat their fruit, the children that are 7 Sifra (ed. Malbim), p. 100a.

The prophet feels that such terrible punishment is unjust. So the Ruah Hakodesh answers him, "Was not the priest and the prophet slain in the Sanctuary of the Lord?" This refers to the priest Zechariah ben Judah whom tradition regards as a martyr.I9 Here the Ruah Hakodesh points to the eternal law of compensation in justification of Israel's punishment at the behest of God. This law is further illustrated in the punishment of the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Rabbinic conception is that the Pharaoh threatened Israel with five evil scourges as he prepared to overtake and recapture them; the Ruah Hako- desh correspondingly makes known five counter penalties which will be meted out to him.20 From this discussion it is quite evident that the Inter- preters, whether it was in direct or indirect colloquy, made use of the term Ruab Hakodesh in the sense of the Divine Essence, irrespective of the motives and purposes they had in mind. The Ruah Hakodesh is the representative of God. It is the agent of God. It is a synonym for God.21 Some remarks are perhaps in place which should have for their purpose an explanation of the reasons why the Rabbis resorted to metonymies. We believe that there were two reasons: To avoid anthropomorphism, and to avoid the use of the Tetragrammaton. It must be borne in mind, of course, that the Ruah Hakodesh was not the only substitute for the actual name of God. There were many others, "Adonai" (Lord), "Hamakom" (Existence), "Harahman" (The Merciful One), "Mi she'amar wehaya ha'olam" (Who spoke and the 19 Sifra, p. 226. 20 Mekilta, Beshallah (ntv:). 21 As a direct proof that this interpretation is correct compare Tosefta 9, 3 with Sifre 24a. In the latter text "Hamakom"-Existence-is used to express the same idea as Ruah Halkodesh expresses in the former text. And we know that "Hamalom" is frequently used in Rabbinic literature as a metonymical expression for God, for the Tetragrammaton.</page><page sequence="11">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 61 World was), "Hakadosh Baruk Hu" (The Holy One Blessed be He) are some of the other alternates. Scholars differ as to the motives which actuated the Rabbis to discourage and to inhibit the use of the Tetra- grammaton. Some scholars hold that it was a feeling of reverence that caused the Jew to shrink from uttering the Sublime Name. Some believe that its employment was forbidden to guard against the desecration of the Holy Name. Some argue that it was not pronounced for fear that the heathen would learn it and desecrate it. It is probable that each of these explanations has an element of truth, and the three reasons combined closely approxi- mate the truth. Whatever the reason may have been, the pronouncing of the Eternal Name was discouraged and, in fact, interdicted. The Talmud records: R. Yohanan taught, The Name of the four letters (YHWH) was transmitted by the Sages to their disciples only once a week; others say twice a week. As it is written, "This is my name forever." The word "le'olam" is written defective (without a waw) . . . The Holy One Blessed be He, said, "Not as I am written am I called. I am written with the letter Y. H. But I am called with the letter A. D. (Adonai, the Hebrew for Lord.)"22 Moreover, the Mishnah states that among those who shall have no portion in the "world to come" ('Olam Haba) is included the individual who utters the real name of God, as it is put in the sources, "And he who pronounces the Divine Name according to its letters, has no share in the Future World."23 22 T.

There is yet another reason for this replacement. It is the avoidance of anthropomorphisms. The Rabbis quite early tried to modify the sharp anthropomorphic expres- sions in the Bible. The use of the phrase, "as it were" (1:'::), the Targumic use of the term "Memra" (n~I'n) make evident this tendency. The expression Ruah Hako- desh, too, was no doubt used for this purpose. These, it would seem, are the motives which actuated the Rabbis to discourage and to interdict the use of the Tetragrammaton. Therefore, they resorted to substitutes which, in the course of time, became the popular designations for the Deity. A corollary to the conception that the Ruah Hakodesh is a metonymy for God is the further definition of it as the "Presence of God." That is to say, just as this phrase is frequently a denominative for the Tetragrammaton so it is also at times a designation for a theophany, the mani- festation of God to man at a definite designated place. This rare and unusual shade of the Ruah Hakodesh concept is easily recognizable in Tannaitic-Midrashic litera- ture. It is always in juxtaposition with the Hebrew word "Yetsivah" (nnm')-presenting oneself at an appointed place designated by God. It is generally stated by the Rabbis in the formula: wnmpn m nlh P mi:po D ,', ]' . The expression "presentation" (yetsivah) always refers to the Ruah Hakodesh.24 Wherever any form of this word occurs in the Bible, whether it be in the Pentateuch, the Historical books, or the Prophets, there exists the implication that the Divine Presence manifested itself there. In other words, God 24 Midrash Tannaim, p. 180. Mekilta, Bo (t:) and parallels.</page><page sequence="13">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 63 commands man to present himself at a certain definite place in order that He may there reveal Himself to him. This is the meaning of the Ruah Hakodesh when used in conjunction with the word "Yetsivah."25 It is of interest to note that Miriam the sister of Moses, according to the Rabbis, is regarded as a prophetess solely on the basis of the term Yetsivah occurring in connection with her life story. "Whence do we learn that Miriam was a prophetess?" the Rabbis ask. "For it is written "And his sister stood afar off . . . ' " (Ex. 2. 4)-"Stood" (:xnnl) refers to the Ruah Hakodesh, the Rabbis interpret. Because of this theophany Miriam is regarded as a prophetess in Rabbinic literature. 25 One might suppose that there is a glaring objection to this explana- tion by the statement that seems contradictory: ;nri: im ;n:'' ]'1 (Wherever the term "Yetsivah" is mentioned (in Scripture) it always implies prophecy.) From this excerpt one might conclude that pro- phecy, or the gift of prophecy, is the implication of the term "Yetsi- vah." An actual study will, however, disclose the fact that this passage is not at all contradictory to our particular assumption. In the first place, such a study discloses the fact that the expression Ruah Hakodesh occurs with the word "Yetsivah" three times while the word "Nebu'ah" (nxr:w) in this connection occurs only once. More- over, the text which places "Nebu'ah" alongside "Yetsivah" interprets the word "Merahok" (plnno) to refer to the Ruah Hakodesh. And this expression in this situation means exactly the same thing as when Ruah Hakodesh is found together with "Yetsivah." Furthermore, Miriam is the heroine of this legend. She is a prophetess. So the Hagga- dist here simply combines the divine theophany with the purpose of that theophany-inspiration for the prophetess. Prophecy, wisdom and knowledge-the prerequisites for future prophets-the text tells us, is bestowed upon her. She is thus a fully matured prophetess. There is yet one more explanation. It is quite plausible that our present text simply misplaced the two terms Ruah Hakodesh and "Nebu'ah". The actual order may have placed Ruah Hakodesh along- side "Yetsivah" and "Nebu'ah" alongside "Merahok." Then the passage would be quite logical. It would first tell about the theophany. Then it would relate the purpose of the theophany-to give prophecy, wisdom and knowledge to Miriam. Such a rearrangement of the diffi- cult sentence would remove the contradiction. Mekilta, Beshallah (nwvn).</page><page sequence="14">64 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Another deductive and derivative conception of the Ruah Hakodesh as associated with the God Idea signifies the Divine Will or Divine Guidance. Peculiarly enough, only one excerpt has been found which deals with this phase of the Ruab Hakodesh. But, in our opinion, there can be no other definition of this term in the cited text. "The land of Israel," the Rabbis teach, "was apportioned by means of the Ruah Hakodesh,"26 by means of the Divine Will is our interpretation. This Divine Will was revealed through the instrumentality of the goral-the lot. God thus guided the apportionment of Palestine. It was not divided in a haphazard way without purposive design. God's guidance governed the allotment of the soil among the several tribes. To regard the distribution of the land in Palestine as Divinely fixed, is not at all singular from the Rabbinic viewpoint. Here, the Ruah Hakodesh is simply the vehicle to represent this phenomenon. It may perhaps have been introduced to avoid a too sharp and flagrant anthropomorphism. This ends the interpretations of the term Ruah Hakodesh which come under our first category in which God is the centre of attention. In this classification there actually are three interpretations of this phrase. Its primary meaning is a metonymic expression for the Tetragrammaton. As a corollary to this explanation it represents a theophany- God's Presence. And the second derivative definition signi- fies the Divine Guidance of human affairs. Even a cursory perusal of the citations in which the Ruah Hakodesh represents these three ideas, will reveal the inter-dependence and the inter-relation of these con- cepts: God, God's Presence, God's Guidance. One pre- supposes the others. God is expected to reveal His Presence. God is expected to govern human affairs. Therefore it is 26 Sifre on Numbers (ed. Friedman), p. 49a.</page><page sequence="15">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 65 not at all strange that the Rabbis on a few occasions applied the identical term to God, to His Presence and to His direction of human destiny. It is now proposed to discuss the second division-the division in which the Ruah Hakodesh is applicable to man. Here man is the main actor. It is man who makes use of it, he is the centre. When it is said that man is the focus about which the Ruah Hakodesh rotates, it is not meant to imply that it does not emanate from God. Such an implication would be preposterous. It simply means that man is the actor. It is man who "possesses" it. It is man who makes use of it. It is man, who, by possessing it, becomes prominent and distinguished among his fellow-men. It is man, who by it and through it, reaches degrees of excellence and perfection. Throughout the ensuing discussion, the Ruah Hakodesh signifies "Divine Inspiration." This is a blanket definition. It is consequently insufficient, inadequate, and indefinite. It does not enable one to understand the finer phases in the meaning of the Ruah Hakodesh. Only a proper analysis can reveal the fulness of ideas contained in this Rabbinic phrase. In order to obtain the proper conception of the Ruah Hakodesh as Divine Inspiration, it must be regarded from the viewpoint of its effect on man. The pertinent question which must always be asked, is, "What effect does the "possession" or the reception of the Ruah Hakodesh, Divine Inspiration, have on the fortunate individual?" A proper perspective of the real characteristics of the Ruab Hakodesh is obtainable through the answer to this question. It is thus possible to note the several effects it has upon individuals. For the effects are not always the same. The individuals who obtain the Ruab Hakodesh do</page><page sequence="16">66 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW not distinguish themselves in the same way. Their impor- tance manifests itself in different lines of endeavor. Divine Inspiration affects people differently. Some, as will be seen, become prophets, others sages, still others poets and musicians, et cetera. As is to be expected, the greatest and the most compelling effect of the Ruah Halkodesh-Divine Inspiration-upon an individual is prophecy. Men, through and by means of this godly gift, become prophets. A prophet then, was a person on whom the Ruah Hakodesh rested. And as a result of this experience, he became a seer. Sometimes this experience was only momentary or tem- porary as in the case of the Seventy Elders (Numbers 11. 25). The Rabbis explained the clauses "they prophesied, but they did so no more" to mean, "that they prophesied no more after that time." They, however, uttered their prophesies at that time with the help of the Ruah Hako- desh.27 Moreover, certain individuals may lose the charac- teristics of the true prophet when the Ruah Hakodesh is withheld from them. The status of Hananiah, the opponent of Jeremiah, is a case in point. This man, according to Rabbi Akiba, "was at first a true prophet but later became a false prophet. When the Rual Hakodesh withdrew from him he stole the words of Jeremiah and prophesied them . . ."28 From the excerpt quoted, it may be implied that as a rule once a man experienced the Ruah Hakodesh he con- tinued to do so. Particularly is this true with the Biblical literary prophets. For they are the ideal possessors of the Ruah Hakodesh. They are the quintescent enjoyers of the Ruah Hakodesh.. With the death of the last three repre- 27 Sifre Zutta (ed. S. H. Horovitz), p. 272. 28 Midrash Tannaim, p. 63.</page><page sequence="17">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 67 sentatives of this group, the Ruah Hakodesh permanently disappeared from Israel.29 We are also told how the Ruah Hakodesh is bestowed upon the prophet. That is to say, what was the process of inspiration; what was the method whereby the Ruah Hakodesh rested on man? The prophets, with the excep- tion of Moses, the peer of them all, the Rabbis teach, did not obtain this beatifying boon by actually "speaking with God face to face." Not at all! The words of God are put into their mouths. They, the inference is, are unaware that the process of inspiration is taking place. Moses is the only man who received it through direct personal contact with the Deity.30 An additional interesting item is the Rabbinic conception of prophecy. An examination of the texts in which the Ruah Hakodesh is defined as prophecy, we believe, will show that by prophecy is understood the power to foretell events, the ability to foresee occurrences as well as the faculty to know what is in another person's mind. Thus Deborah knows what Sisera's mother is thinking about.3I Israel, in the wilderness, knew what plans the Pharaoh in Egypt made for their return to bondage.32 Israel has the capacity to know where the jewels of the Egyptians are hidden.33 Perhaps it is worth noting this last item in full. The Israelites before their departure from Egypt, succeeded in despoiling the land of its "jewels of silver, and jewels of gold." They were, however, on the verge of failure because the Egyptians refused to trust them with their valuables. Then the Ruah Hakodesh came to the help of Israel. Through its influence the Israelites succeeded. The Egyp- 29 Tosefta, Sotah 13, 2. 30 Sifre on Deut., p. 107b. 31 Sifre Zutta, p. 269 and parallels. 32 Mekilta de R. Simon ben Yohai (ed.

Then the Egyptians delivered the articles demanded. Here the ability to foreknow and to foretell was bestowed on all Israel by means of the Ruah Hakodesh so that they should not leave their oppressors empty-handed. Aaron, because the Ruah Hakodesh rested on him, knew where to wait for Moses on the road to Egypt to accompany him to the court of Pharaoh to demand the release of Israel.34 The traditional conception of the true prophet is primarily the man who possesses these supernatural qualities. The man who truly foretells events is the true prophet-the truly inspired man-the true man of God, the true mes- senger of God. The Ruah Hakodesh is the means whereby this distinction is acquired. It is of special interest to note that this prophetic power was possessed by two women who are generally not placed among the prophets. These women are Rahab35 and Abigail.36 Tradition enumerates seven prophetesses. These are Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Abigail, Huldah, Esther and Hannah.37 Abigail is found among these distinguished women. Rahab, however, is not included in this list. To her tradi- tion assigns a different distinction, a distinction which she, as a woman, no doubt coveted more and probably prized higher. She, together with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther are looked upon as the four most beautiful women in the world.38 An immediate corollary of the concept that the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh is prophecy is the observation that 34 Mekilta de Rabbi Simon ben Yohai, p. 15. 35 Sifre on Deut., p. 69b. 36 Sifre Zutta, p. 319.

Just as certain men became prophets by means of the Ruah Hakodesh-Divine Inspira- tion-so some men become sages, steeped in the lore of wisdom, through its influence. Similar to prophecy, wisdom is a gift from God. God is the source of all wisdom. He, through the Ruah Hakodesh, communicates to the selected man a bit of that Divine Wisdom by means of which the latter is more than merely humanly wise and learned. This phase of the Ruah Hakodesh is clearly illustrated in the Rabbinic controversy as to whether Canticles and Ecclesi- astes should be placed in the Canon. "R. Simon ben Manasya taught that Canticles makes the hands unclean (washing of hands necessary after handling of book in tjhe Canon) because it was composed by means of the Ruah Hakodesh. "Koheleth" (Ecclesiastes) does not make the hands unclean, because it is a product of the wisdom of Solomon.39 This Baraita places the Ruah Hakodesh in juxtaposition to the wisdom of Solomon. Therefore there must be some similitude between the two. This parallelism becomes clear, when it is examined from the standpoint of effect. The Ruah Hakodesh-Divine Inspiration-communicated to Solomon a type of Wisdom which manifested itself in Canticles. Ecclesiastes was written without godly inspira- tion, purely by human effort. Therefore the first is a sacred book and the latter is not, according to this authority. Moreover, Moses' wisdom was also the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh.4o Moses heard the Oral Law from God Himself. He studied it with the help of the Ruah Hako- desh. Yet, the Rabbis say, he required time to ponder and to meditate on the subject. Certainly, ordinary mortals, 39 Tosefta Yadayim 2, 14. 40 Sifra, p. 16 and p. 17b.</page><page sequence="20">70 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Rabbis continue, to become real sages in the Law must think and reflect. Here again through the contrasting pic- ture of Moses and other men, it becomes evident that the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh is often Wisdom. An additional proof of the correctness of this interpreta- tion is connected with Hillel. Upon his assumption of the duties of "Nasi" he was asked what the law is with regard to slaughtering the Paschal Lamb, if the sacrificant forgot to prepare the knife on Friday in the case that Passover begins on Saturday evening. He replied that he had forgotten the exact Halakah. But, he continued, "Leave them (the Jews) alone. The Ruah Hakodesh rests on them. If they themselves are not prophets they are the descen- dants of prophets."4I This answer certainly cannot be taken literally. For Hillel could not imply that all the people were prophets. This is impossible because prophecy had long since ceased. Furthermore, the context proves that it could not be taken literally. For the Talmud tells us that the people resorted to the stratagem of putting the knives into the wool of the lambs.42 And that is actually the law, the Talmud points out. From the entire discussion it is evident that the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh in this citation was Wisdom. The intuitive common sense of the people will make no mistake is Hillel's view and this is the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh. Surely wisdom is broad enough to include common sense. We may therefore quite properly conclude that Wisdom- learning and knowledge-is the effect of Divine Inspiration, the Ruah Hakodesh. These two endowments-prophecy and wisdom-are the essential prerequisites of the prophet. They complement and supplement one another. 4I Tosefta Pesa.him 4, 2. 42 T. B. Pesalim 66a.

One statement has: "Whenever the word Yetsivah appears it al- ways refers to the Ruah Hakodesh." Another reads, "Wher- ever the word Yetsivah occurs in Scripture it refers to pro- phecy." We have attempted to harmonize these citations. These two concepts of the Ruah Hakodesh prove, in our opinion, that our interpretation is correct. Since we hold that the effect of Divine Inspiration is sometime prophecy and at other times, wisdom, we may safely conclude that the expressions "Nebu'ah" and Ruab Hakodesh are regarded as interchangeable terms. The first must be looked upon from the viewpoint of effect; the second denotes the cause: the theophany, the place where men may be affected by the Ruah Hakodesh. A third effect which the Ruah Hakodesh produces upon man is generally not recognized. It bestows ability to write poetry and compose music. It makes man an artist. It makes man a poet, in the broad sense of the term. Here is a beautiful conception-the poetic muse is a godly gift. Accordingly the true poet is he who is Divinely inspired, who is under the influence of the Ruah Halkodesh. All the beautiful Biblical poems were written by men and women whose poetic genius was brought into play by the Ruah Hakodesh. Israel after the crossing of the Red Sea, gave vent to its feelings of relief in song because it was under the sway of the Ruah Hakodesh.44 Moses on several occasions poured out his soul in song. At such moments it was the Ruah Hakodesh which prompted his poetic out- bursts. Deborah celebrated her victory over the Hazorite 43 See note 25. 44 Mekilta, Beshallah (nSwm). Tosefta Sotah 6, 2.</page><page sequence="22">72 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW forces, by singing her song of triumph under the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh. David, "the sweet singer of Israel," composed his splendid songs when he was imbued with the Ruah Hakodesh. According to tradition as found in the Mekilta there are ten such poetical parts in Scripture, written by ten persons under the urge of the Ruah Hako- desh. Of course, all the Biblical books are Divinely inspired. But these compositions are especially and purposefully so inspired. In this sense, the Ruah Hakodesh played a specifically important role in the production of the poetic portions of the Bible-the Ruah Hakodesh made possible the several songs in the Bible. Singularly enough, the authors of these poetic passages- with one exception45-are found among the forty-eight prophets so designated by tradition.46 There is great sig- nificance in this fact. The poets were prophets. The poets, like the prophets, were frequently visited by the Ruah Hakodesh. On special occasions the Ruah Hakodesh caused these men to sing as well as write poetry. Thus far the effects of the Ruah Hakodesh discussed- prophecy, Wisdom, and the poetic muse-are objective in their character. The Ruah Hakodesh does not affect the personality "per se" of the prophet or the poet or the sage. As a result of enjoying the Ruah Hakodesh in these cases, the affected individual does something-he prophesies or he poetizes or disseminates knowledge. Now we shall point out effects of the Ruah Hakodesh which are of a subjective nature. Here the personality, as such, is affected by having experienced the Ruab Hakodesh. The affected person be- comes morally pure, or spiritually exalted. In the ensuing discussion, the Ruah Hakodesh contributes towards the personality of its enjoyer something intrinsically and speci- 45 Jehoshaphat is found among the poets but not in the list of prophets. 46 See Rashi, T. B. Megillah 14a.</page><page sequence="23">THE RUAH HAKODESH-PARZEN 73 fically individual. In the preceding discussion, the Ruah Hakodesh utilized the individual to produce benefits for his fellows and not merely for himself. The first subjective effect of the Ruah Hakodesh is moral cleanliness, spiritual purity. That such is one of the conno- tations of the term Ruah Hakodesh is proved from a very quaint Rabbinic statement. R. Eliezer, we are told, when he reached the Scriptural verse: "And because of these abominations the Lord thy God is driving them out before thee" (Deut. 18. 12) was wont to remark, "What harm we cause ourselves! Since he who clings to impurities, a spirit of impurity rests on him. Is it not logical to expect that he who cleaves to God, the Ruah Hakodesh will dwell with him?"47 In this excerpt "impurities" is juxtaposed to God and "a spirit of impurity" is contrasted with the Ruah Hakodesh. "Impurities" refers to idolatries and he who cleaves to these is punished with a spirit of impurity. Just so he who clings to God is rewarded with the Ruah Hako- desh. But what is the effect of this reward upon its recipient? It results in spiritual purity. R. Eliezer continued his ex- planation by asking the question, "Why is the Ruah Hako- desh so little in evidence in Israel?" So he answers with a Biblical verse. "But your iniquities have separated you and your God." (Is. 59. 2). It is this godlessness which causes the spirit of impurity to prevail. Therefore godli- ness leads to cleanliness. Moreover, parallel readings48 fully corroborate this inter- pretation. For they read "Ruah Taharah" (Spirit of Purity) instead of "Ruah Hakodesh." These renderings regard the effect, while the former text gives the cause of the purity- the Ruah Hakodesh. We may therefore quite properly and 47 Sifre on Deut., p. 107b. 48 Midrash Tannaim, p. 107b. T. B. Sanhedrin 65b.</page><page sequence="24">74 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW logically conclude that the Ruah Hakodesh here causes spiritual purity, moral cleanliness of a high order. There is yet a second subjective effect of the Ruah Hako- desh. It holds that the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh is spiritual joy: the recipient of the Ruab Hakodesh becomes spiritually exultant. There is just one statement which deals with this phase of the Ruah Hakodesh. Among the many interpretations of the verse, "And thou shalt rejoice in thy festivals" (Deut. 16. 14) some Rabbis state that this verse refers to the festival of the Drawing of Water and they go on to explain, to use their terminology, "Why was this festival so called? Because they would there imbibe by the Ruab Hakodesh".49 From our general knowledge of this Festival, we know that it was a great joyous occasion. The Talmud tells us, "Anyone who has not witnessed the joy of this festival does not know what happiness is".50 The Palestinian Talmud too throws light on the exultant character of this festival. In one Baraita, R. Joshua ben Levi states: "Wherefore was it known by the name of "Beth Shoebah" (the well from which the water was drawn for libations during the Succoth festival)? For from it, they, the pilgrims, would imbibe the Ruah Hakodesh, as it is written, "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation" (Is. 12. 3).5s There can be no question as to the meaning of Ruah Hakodesh from the viewpoint of effect, in relation to this festival. It causes spiritual exaltation and joy. One author- ity even goes so far as to state that the Ruah Hakodesh on this occasion rests only on those of gladsome hearts. It is worth while to quote this Rabbinic dictum. "R. Jonah 49 Midrash Tannaim, 94b. The text reads: nnmt lr--l'n= nnmol n"i l-np,n mlln ]:lW 'n WW ?,nI' :a, r,:lwn; ri p na n,'nni ,rn:lap, n,:. 50 T.

"This is to teach," he concludes, "that the Ruah Hakodesh rests only on those of gladsome hearts".52 We consequently feel justified in our conclusion that the effect of the Ruah Hakodesh, in this instance, represents the joyous gladsome spirit, the mirthful exalting mood. To sum up briefly what the Ruah Hakodesh from the standpoint of effect means in our second category. It con- notes prophecy and wisdom, poetic inspiration, spiritual purity and spiritual exaltation. In order to prove that the division of the conception of the Ruah Hakodesh into two classes is not altogether arbitrary, reference may be had to a Rabbinic source. There is a statement in "Abot of Rabbi Nathan "(num 1n, '-n-)53 which seems to corroborate this division. It reads, "The Ruah Hakodesh has ten synonyms. They are, Mashal (wvo) proverb; Melitsah (nrrno) metaphor; Ijidah (m,n) riddle; Dibbur ('n:17) the Word (Revelation); Amirah (nrDn,) Speech; Tiferet (n'ltn)s4 Glory; Tsiwui (On'x) Command; Massa (ttvo) Burden (of Prophecy); Nebtr'ah (n1m3) Prophecy; Hizzayon (Illtn) Vision. To me this interpretation of the statement presents itself. The words, "Amirah," "Hattifah," "Tsiwui," refer to God. Surely God must be regarded as the actor of these terms. To whom else could "Tsiwui," for instance, refer? This coincides with our first division. The remainder of the expressions refers to man. "Mashal", "Melitsah", "Hidah", refer to wisdom, thus incidentally showing that one impor- tant effect of experiencing the Ruah Hakodesh is wisdom. 52 Ibid: -nI ,mmtm n nr 1 D; mn nnwn DZ71 ',y &gt;l m ,'Y Inn1 '-I nON nmot 3 b 9 ;nm-lt tnipn; mni pmw w1YN ,rnipn mni lby. 53 Ed.

Hakodesh is prophecy. Here we thus find accord with our basic interpretations. It must also be stated before concluding that in the second version of the same text, "Nebu'ah" is substituted for "Ruah Hakodesh." But exactly the same ten definitions are given. This has no bearing upon the validity of our exposition. This version simply reflects, in our opinion, the greatest effect of the Ruah Hakodesh-the most important effect-prophecy.</page></plain_text>
