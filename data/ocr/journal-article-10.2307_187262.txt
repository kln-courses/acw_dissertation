<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy of Science June, 1976 IS PREACCELERATION OF PARTICLES IN DIRAC'S ELECTRODYNAMICS A CASE OF BACKWARD CAUSATION? THE MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS* ADOLF GRUNBAUMt University of Pittsburgh Is it a "conceptual truth" or only a logically contingent fact that, in any given kind of case, an event x which asymmetrically causes ("produces") an event y likewise temporally precedes y or at least does not temporally succeed y? A bona fide physical example in which the cause retroproduces the effect would show that backward causation is no less conceptually possible than forward causation. And it has been claimed ([9], p. 151; [4], p. 41) that in Dirac's classical electrodynamics (relativistic and non-relativistic), the preacceleration of charged particles before any forces are applied to them furnishes a genuine case of retrocausation by later forces. An exposition of the pertinent physics furnishes the basis for arguing the following: Whereas the non-zero acceleration of a neutral NEWTONIAN mass particle is, of course, causally connected as such to the simultaneously applied non-zero force, the non-zero acceleration of a DIRACIAN charged particle is not causally connected at all as such to the applied forces. A fortiori, in Dirac's electrodynamics, the applied forces do not qualify asym- metrically as the causes of a non-zero acceleration as such; nor does a non-zero acceleration as such qualify as an effect produced by forces. This is shown by means of two considerations as follows: (1) In Dirac's theory, no functional dependence of the value of a non-zero acceleration on the weighted time-average of the forces is vouchsafed as a matter of physical LA Walone without any value of a constant of integration, just as no Newtonian law(s) alone can guarantee a functional dependence of the non-zero value *Received October, 1975; revised January, 1976. t I am greatly indebted to my physicist colleagues Jeffrey Winicour, Ezra T.

Instead, both functional dependencies alike are vouchsafed only with the crucial aid of some de facto boundary condition pertaining to either the past or to the future, so that (2) Non-zero preaccelerations of Diracian charged particles can no more be causally attributed as such to the retrocausal action of later forces than non-zero "prevelocities" of Newtonian mass particles can be held to be caused as such by later applied forces. The retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's preaccelerations is just as invalid as the retrocausal interpretation of Newtonian prevelocities. 1. Introduction. Let the asymmetric relation "is the cause or a cause of" and its asymmetric converse "is the effect or an effect of" be denoted respectively by "C" and "E." If x and y are events, we may wish to say of x that it is causally connected with y, regardless of whether xCy or xEy. Thus, we can introduce a symmetric relation of causal connectedness-to be denoted by "CC"-such that xCy and xEy are each sufficient conditions for xCCy. But I make the disjunction xCy v xEy only a sufficient rather than a defining (neces- sary and sufficient) condition for xCCy. And my reason for doing so is that I wish to allow that xCCy can also obtain even if neither xCy nor xEy: As we shall have occasion to note, without the invocation of the volitional anthropomorphism of "making things happen," even Newton's law F= ma does not seem to warrant the claim that the application of a force to a mass particle stands in the asymmetric causal relation C to the particle's simultaneous acceleration. And yet the law-like connection between Newtonian force and acceleration is surely such that they are related at least by the symmetric causal relation CC. The latter particular Newtonian issue aside, in general the distinction between the asymmetric causal relations C and E, on the one hand, and the symmetric causal relation CC, on the other, has been essentially non-controversial in the literature. Asymmetric causality is logically stronger than symmetric causality, because xCy unilaterally entails xCCy. There is no more warrant for controversy on this point than there is for debate on the introduction of a symmetric relation of time-separation between events x and y which obtains regardless of whether x occurs earlier than y or later than y. Thus, if "x &lt;t Y" is short for "x is earlier than y" and "x &gt; y" is short for "x is later than y," we can define the symmetric relation TS of time-separa- tion on the basis of the asymmetric relation &lt;t and of its converse as follows: x TS y = def. x &lt;t Y V X &gt;t Y. But Dirac's work in non-quantum electrodynamics (relativistic and pre-relativistic) as well as the postulation of the causal propagation 166</page><page sequence="3">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS of super-light tachyons in metarelativity has rekindled debate on the merits of the following two rival theses: A. For every pair of causally connected events x and y, if xCy then x qualifies as the asymmetric cause of y solely in virtue of temporally occurring earlier than y. By the same token, for all x, y such that xCCy, if yEx then y qualifies as the effect of x solely on the strength of being the later of the two causally connected events. As a corollary of this thesis, the simultaneity of Fand a in Newton's second law assures that the application of the force can no more be the asymmetric cause of the acceleration than the acceleration can be the asymmetric cause of the force. In short, it is a conceptual truth rather than a sort of happenstance that, in any given kind of case, if xCy then also x &lt;t y, and if yEx then also y &gt;t x. And thus, on this view, just as an ordered pair of simultaneous events cannot stand in the relation C or in the relation E, so also there can be no backward causation (retrocausation), since no event can stand in the relation C to any earlier event. B. The opposing thesis asserts that retrocausation is indeed logically possible and may also be physically possible or even actual. Moreover, this rival thesis allows that within a given pair of simultaneous events, one of them may be asymmetrically the cause of the other over and above being symmetrically causally connected to it. Thus it has been claimed in the particular context of Newtonian mechanics that the force F(t), given as a function of the time t, asymmetrically causes the acceleration a(t). And proponents of this claim of asymmetry believe that it can be sustained even though no such asymmetry is apparent in Newton's second law of motion F(t)= ma(t), which asserts a one-to-one mapping between simultaneous values of the force and the acceleration. Thus we are told that cause and effect can be distinguished from one another as such (i.e., in the which-is-which sense) by criteria other than time order. On this view, our inveterate neglect of this purported fact has created a situation in which "our language is no longer capable of describing a world in which effect may precede its cause," much as the identification of "north" with "downstream" in ancient Egypt did not prepare the Egyptians for an encounter with the Euphrates which happens to flow from north to south [1]. In this vein, it has been maintained that in the case of the presumed causal propagation of the hypothetical super-luminal tachyons, "there are criteria other than temporal order for picking out which of a pair of events causes the other. And these criteria take precedence 167</page><page sequence="4">ADOLF GRUNBAUM over temporal priority" [5]. Elsewhere ([6], pp. 824-827), I have dealt critically with the contention that the postulated existence of tachyons demonstrates the conceptual possibility of an effect which temporally precedes its asymmetric cause. Here I wish to scrutinize in detail the allegation that in Dirac's version of classical electrodynamics [3], the acceleration exhibited by a particle of given mass and charge (e.g., an electron) before any force "acts" on it is related functionally to the forces which do "act" on the particle at one or more later times as follows: these future forces can be held to be (collectively) the asymmetric cause of the particle's preacceleration. This allegation invokes the assertion of Dirac's theory that at any time t, for a constant light velocity c the acceleration a(t) of a particle of given mass and charge is a function of a specified weighted time average of the forces "acting" on the particle during the subsequent period t - t' &lt; oo such that the following is true: The particle accelerates at time t provided that forces generating a non-zero weighted time-average are "applied" to it at some times t' or other during the stated later period. Given such "applied" forces, the particle will accelerate at time t even if no force is "applied" to it until sometime after t during its entire future motion. When speaking here of the Diracian forces as "acting" or as being "applied" to a charged particle, I have placed these terms in raised-eyebrow quotes in order to alert the reader at once to the following fact: As our Eq. (14) below will show quite specifically, the change effected by the action of a Diracian force on a charged particle is not at all of the same kind as the change produced by the application of a Newtonian force to a neutral particle. A non-zero net Newtonian force acts on a neutral particle by effecting a non-zero change-of-velocity, i.e., it acts by causally imparting a non-zero acceleration to the particle. On the other hand, a non-zero Diracian force is not causally responsible at all for a charged particle's possession of a non-zero acceleration: Instead of changing the particle's velocity, a non-zero Diracian force acts by changing the particle's time-weighted acceleration! Unfortunately, physicists and philosophers who have given a retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's acceleration formula in Eq. (13) below have run afoul-as I shall show in detail-of this altogether fundamental difference in causal efficacy between the actions of Newtonian and Diracian forces. Thus, Dirac's preacceleration is adduced as a bona fide illustration of the conceptual and indeed even the physical possibility of retro- causation in the sense that the asymmetric cause is later than its effect. For example, in the particular case of a charged particle which preaccelerates and thereafter receives a very short-lived impulse or 168</page><page sequence="5">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS sharp blow, it is claimed that the preacceleration event is the asymmet- ric effect of the subsequent impulse event. And in this way, it is contended that Dirac's preacceleration has rendered the above concept of retrocausation physically legitimate, alongside the traditionally familiar notion of a tergo causation in which the asymmetric cause is held to precede its effect temporally. But some physicists have spoken of preacceleration behavior as "acausal" rather than as "retrocausal" in order to express their intellectual misgivings concerning it. In this spirit, the physicist J. D. Jackson characterizes preacceleration behavior as "acausal" imme- diately after asserting that it "is contrary to our ideas of cause and effect" ([7], first ed., p. 599; second ed., p. 797). Like Jackson, the physicist P. C. W. Davies ([2], pp. 126-127) notes that the characteristic duration of a relatively appreciable amount of preaccel- eration is only of the order of the time required by light to traverse the classical radius of the electron, which is a time interval of about 6 x 10-24 sec. But explanatorily Davies considers the latter evanes- cence to be cold comfort, since he regards even a fleeting preaccelera- tion to constitute "unpleasant acausal behavior." And hence he concludes rather ruefully: "Unless it can one day be shown that nature is constrained in some fundamental way . . . to preserve causality, this explanation [by appeal to evanescence] will not be totally convincing" ([2], p. 127). By contrast, John Earman ([4], p. 41) espouses the above thesis B and hails electrodynamic preacceleration as a bona fide illustration from physics of his claim that retrocausation-always understood throughout this paper in the sense that the asymmetric cause is later than its effect!-is a coherent conceptual possibility. Since I shall be taking issue with his reasoning in several respects, let me cite in full his statement of the significance which he attributes to preaccel- eration. He says: I believe that backward causation is a conceptual possibility and that the question of whether backward causation exists in nature is a question which must be settled not by armchair philosophers but by natural philosophers. A possible mechanism for backward causation is contained in the Dirac-Plass theory of classical relativistic electrodynamics. According to this theory, an impulsive force causes (I believe that "causes" is the right word) a particle to accelerate before the pulse arrives. For an electron, the preacceleration effect is on the order of 10-23 seconds, and, therefore, it is unlikely that it could be detected by any classical apparatus; so even if it exists in nature, preacceleration may not 169</page><page sequence="6">ADOLF GRUNBAUM give rise to any recognizable future analogues of traces. But still the point remains that a coherent mechanism for the production of traces of the future is at hand. ([4], p. 41) Thus, whereas Jackson and Davies find the presumed existence of preaccelerations causally baffling, Earman regards the presumption of their physical actuality as illuminatingly innovative in regard to causation. Nonetheless, all three of them share an underlying assump- tion, which I shall be challenging fundamentally: The unexamined and all too alluring tacit assumption that irrespective of whether the functional dependence of the acceleration on the later forces is purely lawlike or is vouchsafed only with the aid of a de facto boundary condition, the mere fact that there is this mathematical dependence enables the forces of Dirac's theory to qualify (collectively) as the asymmetric cause of the preacceleration. For it is only because this unexamined tacit assumption is made by Jackson and Davies no less than by Earman that they are able to regard preacceleration as a violation of the following received maxim: If one of two causally connected events is asymmetrically the cause of the other, then the cause must temporally precede the effect. But what I shall contest below, among other things, is precisely their contention that, in the context of Dirac's theory, non-zero forces can be held to be the asymmetric causes of the non-zero accelerations of charged particles. Granted that there is preacceleration of charged particles in nature, I shall argue against this contention as follows: In contrast to Newton's theory, where the force on a mass particle and its simultaneous acceleration are symmetrically causally connected, the functional dependence of the preacceleration of a charged particle on the subsequently applied forces in Dirac 's theory does not have the lawlike character required for qualifying either as asymmetrically causal or even as symmetrically causal; instead this functional dependence is crucially predicated on the imposition of a merely de facto boundary condition in the form of a constant of integration. Hence it will turn out that in Dirac's theory, the forces on a charged particle fail altogether to qualify as asymmetric causes of its accelera- tions: In that theory, the non-zero acceleration of such a particle is not causally connected at all as such to the applied forces. And thus these forces are neither retrocauses nor temporally prior (a tergo) causes of accelerations. Nor yet are they simultaneous causes. To put it metaphorically, in Dirac's theory, forces are not "responsible" for non-zero accelerations, any more than they are causally "responsi- ble" in Newton's theory for the occurrence of non-zero particle velocities as such. For in Dirac's theory, the functional dependence 170</page><page sequence="7">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS of acceleration on force is not purely law-like, but is first achieved only via the value of a constant of integration in the non-relativistic Abraham-Lorentz law of motion, and in the relativistic Lorentz-Dirac law of motion. Indeed, as the details will make clear, Dirac's boundary condition has been viewed as contrived or ad hoc ([9], p. 187), although considerations from quantum electrodynamics have served to mitigate the deus ex machina complaint against it ([9], p. 24). It will have been noted above that Earman adduced preacceleration in classical relativistic electrodynamics. But the differences between the latter theory and its non-relativistic counterpart generate no issues of principle relevant to the assessment of the credentials of the retrocausal interpretation of either version of pre-quantum electro- dynamics. And since the non-relativistic version is mathematically simpler, I shall give a self-contained presentation of its pertinent equations and will then examine the retrocausal interpretation in the latter context. But it will be apparent that if the philosophical moral I draw in the non-relativistic framework is sound, it will apply as well to the relativistic form. We shall now be concerned with the classical non-relativistic form of Dirac's theory, so that the pertinent law of motion is the so-called Abraham-Lorentz equation. Mutatis mutandis, the philosophical anal- ysis to be given in Section 3 below will then be transferable to the relativistic version in which the so-called Dirac-Lorentz equation is the pertinent law of motion. It has been said that unlike Maxwell's equations, the Abraham- Lorentz and Lorentz-Dirac equations of motion are not fundamental laws of nature. As we shall see, these equations are the point of departure for those Diracian equations which serve as the basis of the claim that there is retrocausation in classical electrodynamics. Hence, if the Abraham-Lorentz and Lorentz-Dirac equations are to be disallowed as laws of motion, then the issue posed by the retrocausal interpretation of the Diracian equations clearly does not even arise! Thus, my concern in this essay is only with the soundness of that interpretation, once it is assumed that the Abraham-Lorentz and Lorentz-Dirac equations are electrodynamically pertinent laws of motion. 2. The Functional Dependence of Acceleration on Force in Dirac's Theory. We shall denote derivatives of a given physical property with respect to the time t by appropriate numbers of dots over the letter representing that property. And if m is the mass of a particle with charge e, and c is the velocity of light, then we shall put 171</page><page sequence="8">ADOLF GRUNBAUM 2 e2 3 mc3 so that e is a time-interval which is called "the relaxation time" of the particle. In the particular case of an electron, E is the very short time-interval (;6 x 10-24 sec.) required by a light ray to traverse a distance equal to two-thirds of the classical electron radius ([9], p. 125). If the charged particle is constrained to move in one dimension and is acted upon by a total external force f(t) independent of its velocity v and of its position, then its equation of motion is given by the Abraham-Lorentz law, which states ([8], p. 40; [7], p. 582) that m(v - ev) = f(t) (1) When the force is an explicit function of position, an exact solution of the equation of motion can be obtained for only a small number of space-dependent forces ([8], p. 52). Clearly, on its left-hand side ("l.h.s.") this equation of motion (1) for a charged particle of mass m differs from the corresponding Newtonian equation for an uncharged mass particle by the presence of the so-called "radiative reaction" term mev, which involves the time-derivative of the acceleration v, i.e., a third time-derivative of the position of the particle. Hence, in contrast to the corresponding Newtonian equation, Eq. (1) is not invariant under time-reversal when f(-t) = f(t). For brevity's sake, let us denote the Newtonian force by "N-force," and the Abraham-Lorentz force by "AL-force." Then we can say that the stated major difference between Newton's law and the Abraham-Lorentz law issues in the following fundamental conse- quence: For a neutral particle of given mass m, the N-force at a given time does determine the simultaneous acceleration; whereas for a charged particle of given m and e, the AL-force f(t) in Eq. (1) at a given time t fails to determine the simultaneous acceleration v(t). Instead, in Eq. (1), the quotient f(t)/m determines only the difference between the particle's acceleration and the product of the time-derivative of its acceleration v(t) with its "relaxation"-time e. Accordingly, the Newtonian equation of motion permits the deduc- tion of a particle's trajectory for a particular time-interval T from 'Readers of Davies' discussion of preacceleration ([2], pp. 125-127) will need to be mindful of the following significant misprints in his presentation: (1) His equation (5.44) on his p. 125 requires a second time-derivative of the velocity in the radiative reaction term, but it incorrectly contains only the first time-derivative v, (2) the r.h.s. of his equation (5.48) lacks a factor of E-1, and (3) the l.h.s. of his equation (5.49) should read "v" rather than "i." 172</page><page sequence="9">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS the conjunction of the specification of f(t) for the period T with data concerning the "initial" position x(to) and velocity v(to) of the particle at some one time to during T. By contrast, the presence of a time-derivative of the acceleration in Eq. (1) makes for the fact that, unlike the solution of the Newtonian equation, the solution of Eq. (1) must contain an additional adjustable constant: the "initial" value a(to) of the acceleration at some one time to during T. To call a(to) "adjustable" is to say that, by contrast to Newtonian mechanics, its value is not at all determined as a matter of physical law by the values of other dynamical magnitudes such as f(t) and of m but has the status of a constant of integration. To appreciate the import of the latter requirement of an initial acceleration, let us see first how it manifests itself even in the special case of a free charged mass particle, which is not subject to any external force, be it electromagnetic or non-electromagnetic. (And note that hereafter, we shall no longer need the symbol "e" to denote the charge, and can therefore use it to denote the base of natural logarithms). Thereafter, we shall consider the case in which non-zero forces are present. (i) Force-Free Motion in One Dimension. It is easily verified by differentiation that in this special case of f(t) = O, Eq. (1) has not only the unproblematic solution v = 0 (2) but also the quite intriguing time-dependent solution (t) = o) et/E (3) eto/E If the "initial" time to turns out to be t = O, then Eq. (3) becomes v(t) = (O)et / (4) Thus, until and unless specific de facto initial or boundary conditions to the contrary are imposed, the Abraham-Lorentz law allows the following: Even if no force is ever applied to the particle-so that f(t)= 0 for all times t-the particle's acceleration will go to infinity with indefinitely increasing values of t in the manner of Eqs. (3) or (4). And the latter equations for the force-free case show clearly that, according to the pertinent force-law, even the application of a force f(t) X Ofor at least some instant t or other is NOT a NECESSARY condition for having the particle accelerate at all times! In particular, it is hardly lawfully necessary that a non-zero force be applied at 173</page><page sequence="10">ADOLF GRUNBAUM a given time to in order that the particle have a non-zero acceleration at to, although we know from the solution in Eq. (2) that the AL-law likewise allows a zero-acceleration when there is no force. But precisely because the solutions (3) and (4) for the case f(t) = 0 yield --&gt; oc as t -&gt; o, these solutions have been dubbed "run-away" as well as "self-accelerated." And they have also been termed "non-physical" ([8], p. 38) to convey the presumption that there do not happen to be any such force-free run-away particles in nature. By contrast, within Newton's theory of the motion of neutral mass particles, run-away accelerations are ruled out on the strength of his law F = ma. Since et/E -&gt; oo when t -&gt; while eto/E is positive for all to (-oc &lt; to &lt; so), it follows from (3) or (4) that one can rule out the self-accelerated behavior of a force-free particle only by imposing the requirement that the constant of integration v(to) has the value zero. Since the latter requirement specifies the value of a constant of integration, we can say that, at least prima facie, the assertion that the "initial" acceleration v(to) vanishes has the non-lawlike de facto status of being a mere initial or boundary condition. Thus, Plass writes: Dirac [3] considered the simplest possible case: the motion of a free particle. He pointed out that the physical solution with the acceleration equal to zero could be obtained by choosing the particular value zero for one of the integration constants. ([8], p. 38) Although the assertion v(to) = 0 here has the prima facie status of a non-lawlike initial condition with respect to the AL-law, one might be tempted to suppose that the vanishing of i(to) is lawlike after all on the following purported grounds: An electrodynamic law of energy-conservation validly applicable to motions assumedly sa- tisfying the AL-law forbids the run-away solution (3), and since the exclusion of this solution requires that i(to) = 0, the latter initial condition is lawfully dictated by the conservation of "electrodynamic energy." But on what basis can it be claimed that the run-away solution (3) of the AL-law does violate an electrodynamic law of energy conservation which is indeed validly applicable to motions assumedly satisfying the AL-law? Clearly it would be unavailing here to point out irrelevantly that in the case of conservative Newtonian force fields, the run-away solution (3) does violate the Newtonian law of conservation of dynamical energy. For the latter law derives its sanction from Newton's second-order law of motion by being a definite first integral of the second-order law, provided that the fields of force are conservative. How could the AL-law possibly allow run-away 174</page><page sequence="11">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS accelerations as solutions-which it clearly does-while also entailing as an integral a kind of energy conservation law that forbids these same solutions? If the AL-law were to vouchsafe the constancy of a quantity "E" such that E is called "the electrodynamic energy," then surely the constancy of E would be compatible with any and all solutions of the AL equation of motion, including the run-away solutions. This compatibility is borne out in Sidney Coleman's 1961 Rand Report to which Professor J. D. Jackson has kindly called my attention ("Classical Electron Theory from a Modern Standpoint"; cf. also the same author's 1969 Enrice Summer School lecture on acausality, published in Subnuclear Phenomena, ed. by A. Zichichi, Academic Press, 1970). Plass ([8], pp. 38, 40) stresses that Dirac's interdiction of the run-away solution has the status of a "physical boundary condition" ([8], p. 40) which determines the value of the constant of integration v(to). At the same time, Plass seems to have misleadingly appealed to some kind of dynamical energy-conservation as the reason for ruling out the run-away solutions. Thus, speaking of these solutions, he says first: "The particle does not obtain its added energy from any physical force which acts upon it. Clearly, these are absurd solutions when applied to our real physical world" ([8], p. 38). And then he goes on to say that "the initial value of the acceleration is determined from the following physical boundary condition: as the time approaches infinity, the acceleration cannot increase indefi- nitely unless a corresponding physical force exists which supplies the particle with the required energy" ([8], p. 40). But, for the reasons I have given, Plass's Newtonianly-tinged terms "added energy" and "required energy" can be quite misleading by wrongly suggesting that the run-away accelerations require lawfully forbidden increases of energy. And hence I submit that Plass's clause "unless a corre- sponding physical force exists which supplies the particle with the required energy" should be replaced by the phrase "irrespective of the applied force." Moreover, as Fritz Rohrlich has pointed out to me, the relativistic Lorentz-Dirac equation, which is the counterpart to the AL-law of motion, by itself leads to the "Schott energy," which can be an inexhaustible supply of energy without violating any valid energy conservation. Indeed, any validly derivable energy-conservation law as such allows the amount of energy to be either finite or infinite, since the amount of energy is a de facto matter. And, of course, if a specified energy conservation law does hold in the context of a given dynamical theory, then the conservation of the de facto amount of energy is indeed lawlike. 175</page><page sequence="12">ADOLF GRUNBAUM As we shall see when discussing the case of non-vanishing external forces in Subsection (iii) below, the initial value of v(to) which Dirac requires in Eq. (6) there to interdict run-away solutions may well be non-zero (see fn. 3 there). But in either case, the de facto, non-lawlike character of the value of v(to) thus required by him cannot be justifiably gainsaid on the alleged grounds that a valid law of electrodynamic energy conservation interdicts the run-away accelerations. We saw that the requirement v(to) = 0 is sufficient and necessary to rule out the force-free run-away solution (3). And I maintain that within the framework of Dirac's classical electrodynamics, this re- quirement has the status of a non-lawlike or de facto condition in virtue of being a specification of the value of a constant of integration in this dynamical theory. Since I am thus appealing to the distinction between laws and de facto, non-lawlike initial or boundary conditions, I wish to comment on the limited range of applicability of this distinction. Elsewhere ([6], p. 211), I have noted that whereas physical theories pertaining to processes which are repeatable at different places and times do allow the stated sharp distinction between laws and non- lawlike or de facto boundary conditions, it is highly doubtful that this distinction can be maintained throughout cosmology. For it is not always clear what criterion there is for presuming a global feature of the universe to have the character of a boundary condition rather than that of a law. Moreover, I am prepared to grant the current unavailability of a satisfactory general characterization of the dif- ference between a presumably law-like (or nomic) universal statement and a universal assertion which, if true, is presumed to hold only "accidentally," as it were. But fortunately, it is unnecessary for my purposes here to have such an ambitious general characterization. For the dynamical theories of Newton and Dirac deal with repeatable process-types rather than with a process that is realizable only once. And these theories themselves avowedly accord law-status to their respective differential equations of motion: Newton's second law F= ma and the AL-law. With respect to these avowedly law-like differential equations, any specification of the value of a constant of integration qualifies as de facto or non-lawlike. Of course, the converse of the latter statement does not hold: The value of a physical quantity (e. g. the magnitude of the force applied to a particle at a given time) need not be such a constant of integration in order to qualify as a non-lawlike or de facto initial condition. Physicists sometimes distinguish between those de facto conditions which are satisfied asymptotically-e.g. "at infinity"-and other non-lawlike conditions which specify the values of state variables 176</page><page sequence="13">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS at some one time to - oo I in the sense required for the solution of the Cauchy initial value problem. And they then apply the term "boundary conditions" to the former while referring to the latter as "initial conditions." On this usage, one would characterize as a "boundary condition" Dirac's asymptotic requirement that as t -&gt; oo, the acceleration cannot increase indefinitely irrespective of the applied forces. In Subsection (iii) of the present Section 2 we shall see the following: Given the AL-law, in the case of non-zero applied forces no less than in our present force-free case, this Diracian interdiction of run-away solutions is equivalent to the specification of the required value v(to) of the "initial" acceleration at time to. But in any event, the stated distinction between de facto boundary and de facto initial conditions will turn out to be immaterial for our critique of the retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's theory. Instead what will matter for our purposes is that both of these conditions are non-lawlike. Before discussing solutions of the non-relativistic AL-law of motion in the case of forces which do not vanish, some comments on the relativistic form of Dirac's theory are in order. (ii) Run-Away Solutions in Dirac's RELATIVISTIC Electrodynam- ics. My repudiation of the retrocausal interpretation of either form of Dirac's classical electrodynamics will turn out to call attention to the de facto-as opposed to lawlike-character of Dirac's interdic- tion of run-away solutions. Having considered the run-away solutions for the force-free case in the non-relativistic theory above, we therefore need to take cognizance of the character of the relativistic run-away solutions and of their interdiction at this stage. Unlike the non-relativistic run-away motions, the relativistic ones do not involve super-light velocities of massive particles. Instead, the relativistic run-away solutions yield particle motions at velocities which increase asymptotically up to the velocity of light from below as t - oo, even when no force at all is applied to the particle. Thus, speaking of the relativistic Lorentz-Dirac equation of motion-as distinct from the non-relativistic AL-equation-Rohrlich says: But this [Lorentz-Dirac] equation is not without difficulties. The most important one was discussed in detail by Dirac: The appear- ance of a third derivative of position [here Rohrlich refers to an earlier equation] does not permit a determination of the solutions of this equation in terms of the Newtonian initial conditions of position and velocity. A whole family of solutions results, and, most embarrassingly, all but one of these solutions . . . give the electron a velocity which increases asymptotically (in the distant 177</page><page sequence="14">ADOLF GRUNBAUM future) to the velocity of light irrespective of the applied forces; it happens even when no force at all is acting [the foregoing italics are added]. These runaway solutions [italics in original] became of great concern to everyone working with the Lorentz- Dirac equation. ([9], p. 22) Since the relativistic run-away motions do not involve super-light velocities, the purely de facto character of Dirac's interdiction of these run-away motions is of course not impugned by the fact that the relativistic prohibition of super-light motions for massive (neutral or charged) particles is indeed lawlike: As is clear from Rohrlich's statement, any exclusion of relativistic particle accelerations which occur irrespective of the applied forces and result in arbitrarily high yet subluminal velocities is now lawlike. But in his relativistic theory, Dirac does interdict these run-away particle motions. Thus this prohibition of Dirac's has the de facto character of being a boundary condition instead of being lawlike. We shall recall the latter conclusion in our philosophical analysis in Section 3. Since we mentioned relativistic accelerations that issue in run-away motions, let us mention two things which should be remembered when comparing relativistic run-away accelerations with non-relativistic ones. Firstly, relativistic accelerations can be either three-dimensional or four-dimensional. Secondly, the three-dimensional relativistic accel- eration differs from the Newtonian one as follows: Whereas the latter is an invariant of the Galilean transformations, the former is not Lorentz-invariant. In particular, a three-dimensional relativistic accel- eration which is temporally constant in one inertial frame would not in general be constant in other frames ([10], ?12, p. 27). (iii) One-Dimensional Motion Under Non-Vanishing External Forces. We now resume our discussion within the framework of the non-relativistic version of Dirac's theory by reference to the AL-law stated in our Eq. (1). As we saw, Eqs. (3) and (4) are zero-force solutions of Eq. (1), since they make f(t) on the right-hand side (r.h.s.) of the latter equation vanish. Suppose that we find a particular integral of Eq. (1) for the case in which the force function f(t) on its r.h.s. does not vanish. Then the addition of the function in Eq. (3) to this integral will also be a solution of Eq. (1) for the case f(t) X 0. If we denote a particular solution v(t) of Eq. (1) by "Vp(t)," then we can verify that et/E ft v (t) - e-e f(t' )dt' (5) mEto e 178</page><page sequence="15">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS where the unprimed upper limit t of the integral is the free variable, while the primed variable t' is the variable of integration.2 Upon adding the r.h.s. of Eq. (3) to that of Eq. (5), the general solution of Eq. (1) can now be written as follows: v(t) = et/E [e-'o/E i (to) - - e-, f(t') dtf (6) em to Clearly, in any given case of a specific force function f(t), the indefinite integral f e-t'/E f(t') dt' would have a correspondingly specific func- tional form 4)(t'), so that the definite integral on the r.h.s. of Eq. (6) would become c (t) - )(to). In the particular case of to = 0, Eq. (6) clearly takes the following more customary form ([8], p. 40, Eq. (18)): v(t) = e / [v(0)- e- t'/ f(t')dt' (7) em Although Eq. (7) is a more customary form of the general solution of Eq. (1) than Eq. (6), I shall refer to Eq. (6) in order to emphasize that the zero of time has no particular significance. We must now call attention to a number of features of the general solution (6) of Eq. (1) which will be of fundamental importance to our inquiry. 1. In view of the presence of a time derivative of the acceleration v(t) in Eq. (1), the general solution (6) of this AL-equation of motion differs from the corresponding Newtonian equation by containing a term which involves as a factor an "initial" acceleration v(to). And, in striking contrast to Newtonian mechanics, for a particle of given characteristics the value of i(to) is not at all determined as a matter of physical law ALONE by f(to) ITSELF or even by the values of f(t) for all times t, taken by themselves! Since the "initial" acceleration in Eq. (6) is thus adjustable as a matter of de facto boundary condition, the force function of the AL-law is not ITSELF sufficient to determine the acceleration i(t) of a particle of given mass and charge at the time t. In particular, Eq. (6) shows that, for a given kind of particle, even if the weighted time average of the forces is non-zero, the application of NON-zero forces at one or more times t' during a time interval t1 c t' - t or t &lt; t' - t2 is BY ITSELF no more a lawfully sufficient condition for the particle's possession of a NON-zero acceleration v(t) at the time t than this application 2To verify that Eq. (5) is a particular solution of Eq. (1), recall that d/dt ftt e-t'/E f(t') dt' = e-tEf(t), and then note that the time derivative of v, becomes vP (t) = v (t)/ - (I/me) f(t), which is a special case of Eq. (1). 179</page><page sequence="16">ADOLF GRUNBAUM BY ITSELF is a lawfully necessary condition for v(t) X O. Small wonder, therefore, that Eq. (6) also allows non-zero preaccelerations as follows: v(t) can be non-zero at time t even if no force acts on the charged particle until some time t' which is later than t. Note that the term "by itself" is to be understood as synonymous with "in the absence of further de facto boundary conditions." 2. I placed the term "initial" in raised-eyebrow quotes when referring to the acceleration v(to) at the time to as being initial. For it is immaterial in Eq. (6) whether to has a value tI less than t or a value t2 greater than t: If the instant to is earlier than the instant t, then the integral on the r.h.s. of Eq. (6) is taken over the forces acting during the interval to &lt; t' - t before the time t at which the particle has some as yet unspecified acceleration v(t); on the other hand, if alternatively to is later than t, then the integral in question is taken over the forces acting during the interval t - t' &lt; to after the time t. (If we wish, we can, of course, computationally avoid integrating from the later time to to the earlier time t by simply changing the sign outside the integral along with exchanging the limits of integration, so as to then integrate from the earlier time t to the later time to.) But regardless of whether to is earlier than t or later, until and unless there is a specification-by way of de facto boundary condi- tion-of the value of the "initial" acceleration v(to) at the chosen earlier OR later time t0, in the law stated in Eq. (6) the weighted time average of the force function just fails to determine the accelera- tion v(t) possessed by a given kind of particle at the time t. More precisely, regardless of whether non-zero forces are applied bedore the time t or afterward, a non-zero weighted time-average of the forces fails to be either a lawfully necessary or a lawfully sufficient condition for the particle's possession of a non-zero acceleration at time t. But, if a boundary condition is given as to the value of i(to) for a time to BEFORE t, then the acceleration v(t) of the given kind of particle at the instant t becomes a mathematical function via Eq. (6) or just the weighted time average of the EARLIER forces. And in this sense we can then say that once v(to) is given for a time to &lt; t, the earlier forces "predetermine" the acceleration at time t, although that predetermination is NOT vouchsafed as a matter of physical law alone. On the other hand, if a boundary condition is given as to the value of v (to) for a time t AFTER t, then the acceleration i(t) at time t becomes a mathematical function, via Eq. (6), of just the weighted time average of the LATER forces. And in this sense we can then say that once i(to) is given for a time to &gt; t, the later 180</page><page sequence="17">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS forces "retrodetermine" the acceleration at time t, although that retrodetermination is not vouchsafed as a matter of physical law alone. In short, according as the boundary condition specifying the value of v(to) pertains to the past of the instant t OR to its future, the specification of v(to) enables the past forces or the future forces respectively to determine v(t) via Eq. (6). In Newton's mechanics, for a given kind of particle the forces alone-without particular boundary conditions-lawfully determine the change of the velocity with time though not the value of the velocity at a given time. But in the AL-electrodynamics, the forces alone determine at most the changes of the ACCELERATION with time for a given kind of particle, and certainly do not determine the value of the acceleration at a given time. Thus, the role played by acceleration vis-a-vis force in the AL-law of motion corresponds at best to the role played by velocity vis-a-vis force in Newton's law of motion. And the reason for the stated difference between the AL-electrodynamics and Newtonian mechanics in regard to the status of the acceleration vis-a-vis force is that whereas the AL-law of motion contains a first time derivative of the acceleration as well as a time derivative of the velocity, the Newtonian law of motion contains only a time derivative of the velocity. Thus it will turn out that whereas in Newton's theory force and acceleration are indeed causally connected, in Dirac's theory a non-zero acceleration as such is not even causally connected with a non-zero weighted time-average of the forces, let alone causally connected such that the forces qualify asymmetrically as the cause while the non-zero acceleration qualifies asymmetrically as the effect. Further on below, the mentioned analogy between the role of acceleration vis-a-vis force in Eq. (6) and the role of velocity vis-a-vis force in Newton's mechanics will enable us to give a reductio ad absurdum of the retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's preacceleration by showing the following: A non-zero preacceleration, possessed by a Diracian charged mass particle before any forces are applied to it, is no more causally attributable as such to subsequently applied forces than a non-zero "prevelocity," possessed by a Newtonian mass particle prior to the action of any forces on it, can be attributed causally as such to forces which act on the particle thereafter. And yet proponents of the retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's non-zero preacceleration would rightly recoil from the retrocausal interpretation of Newton's non-zero prevelocity. Why? Because they know that within Newton's theory, it would be wrong to invoke the rival neo-Aristotelian assumption that a non-zero velocity is causally depen- dent as such on the action of a non-zero force. But unfortunately 181</page><page sequence="18">ADOLF GRUNBAUM the electrodynamic retrocausalists do not similarly abstain from the equally illicit though tacit appeal within Diracian electrodynamics to the Newtonian causal dependence of a non-zero acceleration on a non-zero force, a dependence denied by Eq. (6), as we shall see. To prepare the ground for my subsequent philosophic elaboration of the stated reductio argument, it will be useful at this stage to digress from the discussion of Eq. (6) in order to derive the Newtonian Eq. (10) below, which will show just how the role played by velocity vis-a-vis force in Newton's mechanics is analogous to the role played by acceleration vis-a-vis force in Eq. (6). Specifically, we now want to derive the particular Newtonian equation which exhibits the follow- ing: According as the boundary condition specifying the value of the "initial" velocity v(to) pertains to the past of the instant t OR to its future, the specification of v(to) enables the past forces or the future forces respectively to determine the velocity v(t) at the time t. Let us write Newton's second law of motion for one-dimensional motion as dv m = F(t) (8) dt Then for respectively fixed and variable times to and t, dv t r dv=-f F(t')dt' (9) o m to where t is the free variable and t' the variable of integration. Hence I t v(t) = v(to) + - F(t') dt'. (10) m Jto Clearly, if a boundary condition is given as to the value of v(to) for a time to before t, then the velocity v(t) of the given kind of particle at the instant t becomes a mathematical function via Eq. (10) of just the forces acting during the earlier time interval to - t' - t. On the other hand, if a boundary condition is given as to the value of v(to) for time to after t, then the velocity v(t) at time t becomes a mathematical function of just the forces acting during the later time interval t - t' - to. In the latter case, we can say that the later forces "retrodetermine" the velocity at the time t, while remaining ever mindful that this "retrodetermination" is not vouchsafed as a matter of physical law alone! This retrodetermination is no more mysterious than the corresponding "predetermination." For consider any situation in which we are given a lawful relation (for a given 182</page><page sequence="19">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS kind of particle) between the net force at time t and the time-rate of change at time t of a certain quantity Q, which is the velocity in this case. Then if the value of Q is specified for a time to later than t, the value of Q at the earlier time t will become dependent on the time-integral of the later forces acting during the interval [t, to]; and the reason is plainly as follows: That time-integral then determines the earlier value of Q at time t by determining the change, if any, in Q as between its given later value at time to and its value at time t. Mutatis mutandis, the same can be said for "predetermina- tion." But note that until and unless restrictive boundary conditions to the contrary are imposed, the integrated equivalent (10) of Newton's law (8) allows any one of the states-of-affairs (a)-(d), which I am about to characterize. I ask the reader's indulgence to let me state them despite their obviousness, because they will be ancillary to our reductio argument later on: (a) v(t) can be zero even if F(t') is never zero during the closed time-interval [to, t] or [t, to]. This state of affairs would obtain if v(to) = F(t')dt', m o (b) v(t) can be non-zero, even if F(t') is always zero during the closed time-interval [to, t] or [t, to]. This state-of-affairs would obtain if v(t) = v(to) i 0, (c) v(t) can be non-zero at time t even if no force acts on the particle until some time t' which is later than t. For brevity, we can therefore say that the Newtonian particle can have a non-zero "PREvelocity." (d) v(t) can, of course, be non-zero at a time t even though no force has acted on the particle ever since some time t' which is earlier than t. Thus we can say for brevity that a Newtonian particle can have a non-zero "POSTvelocity." In other words, Eq. (10) tells us via result (a) that, despite generating a non-zero time-integral, the action of a non-zero force F(t') during the entire closed past time-interval [to, t] or future time-interval [t, to] is itself NOT a lawfully sufficient condition for the particle's possession of a non-zero VELOCITY v(t) at time t. But, of course, Eq. (8) tells us that in Newtonian mechanics such a force is ITSELF a lawfully sufficient condition for the particle's possession of a non-zero acceleration v(t) at time t. Even a non-zero force F(t) just at the instant t would thus be sufficient. Furthermore, Eq. (10) tells us 183</page><page sequence="20">ADOLF GRUNBAUM via result (b)-as indeed does Newton's first law of motion-that the following is the case: The action of a non-zero force during [to, t] or [t, to] or even just at the instant t is not a lawfully necessary condition for the particle's possession of a non-zero velocity at time t, if no restrictive boundary condition has been imposed on the magnitude of the velocity at one or more other times. But Eq. (8) tells us that, in Newton's mechanics, a non-zero force at the instant t is a lawfully necessary condition for a non-zero acceleration at the time t, even in the absence of any boundary conditions. Thus, our comparison of the Newtonian equation (10) with the AL-equation (6) exhibits the analogy between the role of velocity vis-a-vis force in Newton's law and the role of acceleration vis-a-vis force in the AL-law as follows: Just as-in Newton's mechanics-a non-zero time-integral of the forces is itself neither lawfully sufficient nor lawfully necessary for a non-zero VELOCITY, so also-in the AL-electrodynamics-a non-zero weighted time-average of the forces is itself neither lawfully sufficient nor lawfully necessary for a non-zero ACCELERATION. Returning to equation (10), we shall now impose a particular boundary condition as to the value of v(to) for a later time to &gt; t so as then to render v(t) retrodetermined by the later forces in a particularly simple way. Let the given boundary condition be that as t -&gt; o, the velocity v(t)-- 0, a de facto condition which is computationally tantamount to requiring that for to = o, v(to) = O, i.e., v(oc) = 0. Upon imposing this boundary condition regarding the infinite future, Eq. (10) yields 1 t f v(t) = - F(t') dt' =- f F(t') dt' (11) m m Recalling our coinage of the term "Newtonian prevelocity" under result (c) of Eq. (10) above, Eqs. (10) and (11) justify our saying the following: Once the specified futuristic boundary condition is imposed, a Newtonian particle can have a non-zero PREvelocity at a time t such that this non-zero prevelocity is mathematically a function of non-zero forces which will first be acting on the particle after t. In short, if non-zero future forces slow a particle down to a zero velocity, then their time-integral determines the particle's present non-zero velocity. Let me emphasize that I have chosen the boundary condition v(oo) - 0 for mathematical simplicity. And note that my reductio argument can be given for any particular choice of v(to) such that v(to) i -1 /m ftF(t')dt' and to &gt; t. 0!N tl\ LUl 184</page><page sequence="21">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS We obtained Eq. (11) after combining the law-like Eq. (10) with the boundary condition v(o) = 0 regarding the infinite future. Let us now alternatively impose on the infinite past the boundary condition v(-oc) = 0. Then Eq. (10) yields 1 t v(t) = -- F(t')dt' (12) m -oc Recalling our coinage of the term Newtonian "postvelocity" under result (d) of Eq. (10) above, Eqs. (10) and (12) justify our saying the following: Once we have imposed the past boundary condition v(-oc) = 0, a Newtonian particle can have a non-zero POSTvelocity at a time t such that this non-zero postvelocity is a function of non-zero forces which acted on the particle only before t. Now I ask: Would the proponents of the retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's preacceleration and those who are dismayed by that preacceleration as "unplesantly acausal"' want to invoke the Newtonian Eq. (11)-or any other equation (11*) derived from Eq. (10) via a particular choice of any v(to) -1/m ftt F(t')dt' for to &gt; t-as a basis for the following claim: "By generating a non-zero time-integral in Eq. (11), or in (11*), non-zero forces which are first applied to the particle at times t' after t are collectively the asymmetric cause of the particle's possession of a non-zero prevelocity at the earlier time t"? If so, would they want to maintain in the light of Eq. (11) that well before the advent of Dirac's theory of electrodynamic preacceleration, Newtonian mechanics furnished a bona fide example of the retrocausal production of non-zero prevelocities as such by non-zero future forces? Or would they recoil from such a retrocausal interpretation of prevelocity on the gounds that-unencumbered by Eq. (11)-the following fact is sufficient to discredit this retrocausal interpretation: The action of non-zero future forces F(t') during the time interval t &lt; t' &lt; x such that the time-integral in Eq. (11) is non-zero is itself neither a lawfully necessary nor a lawfully sufficient condition for the particle's possession of a non-zero prevelocity as such at time t? And if the electrodynamic retrocausalists would thus recoil in the case of prevelocity, why-in the face of the stated import of Eq. (6)!-should they not recoil alike in the case of preacceleration? Let us reserve drawing a moral from these rhetorical questions until after we have stated one further very important consequence of our electrodynamic Eq. (6) and have then shown just how Dirac used a de facto boundary condition to arrive at the following conclusion: Charged particles can have preaccelerations which are mathematically a function of later non-zero forces. 185</page><page sequence="22">ADOLF GRUNBAUM 3. Let us recall the statement of Eq. (6) v(t) = et/e e- to/E v(to) - t' e-t f(t ) dt' . (6) ?em to In virtue of the presence of the exponential function et/E in this Eq. (6), the absolute value of the acceleration i(t) will increase indefinitely as t -&gt; c irrespective of the applied forces, unless the expression within the square brackets vanishes as t -&gt; ([8], p. 40). In the special case in which no forces ever act on a charged particle, this consequence of Eq. (6) tells us that a free particle will have a run-away acceleration, unless v(to) = 0, a fact which we already noted in Subsection (i) by reference to Eq. (3). Dirac was concerned to interdict those accelerations which increase indefinitely irrespective of the applied forces, rather than to forbid indefinitely increasing accelerations per se for any and all force functions! Hence, under the assumption of Eq. (6), the interdiction of run-away accelerations which take place irrespective of the applied forces (and even when no forces are applied) is equivalent to the requirement that the expression in the square brackets of Eq. (6) goes to zero as t -&gt; . But the latter requirement, in turn, is clearly equivalent to the demand that the constant of integration v(to) have the following particular value: eto /e r (to) -- e -t'/ f(t' )dt'. Em o to Note at once that, contrary to Newtonian mechanics, it is here asserted to be a matter of an initial condition rather than of law that the particle's initial acceleration will vanish if f(t')= 0 for all t' &gt; to.3 Although Dirac's prescription of the value of v(to) is a universal statement by holding alike for all charged mass particles, its status within his theory is clearly that of an "accidental" rather than lawlike universal, since it specifies the value of a mere constant of integration within the fundamental equation of motion. We see that under the assumption of Eq. (6), Dirac's asymptotic interdiction of run-away accelerations which take place irrespective of the applied forces is equivalent to the imposition of the initial condition that at the time to, the acceleration i(to) have the value just stated. The reader is asked to recall now the discussion of the non-lawlikeness of initial or boundary conditions given above in 3 In the case of non-vanishing forces such that they generate a non-zero weighted time-average for the period to &lt;s t' - c, the value of iv(to) thus chosen will be non-zero. 186</page><page sequence="23">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS Subsection (i). It is then clear that the Diracian boundary condition which interdicts the run-away accelerations, and the stated equivalent initial condition as to the value of v(to), each have the status of being non-lawlike or de facto assertions. Upon inserting the specified non-lawlike value of v(to) into Eq. (6) we deduce-in analogy to the derivation of Eq. (11) from the Newtonian Eq. (10)-that t/E 0 t v(t)- e -te f(t')dt' -J e-t/ f(t' ) dt so that et/e rOO v(t)=--e e- f(t') dt'. (13) em Jt Clearly, the derivation of Dirac's Eq. (13) from Eq. (6) by means of the stated futuristic asymptotic boundary condition shows two things as follows: (1) Once the initial condition as to the value of (to) is imposed-but not until it is imposed-the nonzero preacceler- ation which a given kind of charged particle can have at a time t becomes mathematically a function of just the non-zero forces which will first be acting on the particle after t, and (2) once the initial value of the acceleration is imposed, v(t)= 0 if, but not only if, f(t') = 0 for all t' - t. Note that the applied forces f(t') can change sign (direction) for different values of t' in the time interval t&lt; t' - oc. Hence even if f(t') is not zero for some values of t' in this time-interval, these non-zero values of f(t') might still generate a vanishing value of the weighted time-average of the forces. Thus, whereas the vanishing of f(t') throughout the time-interval in question does yield a vanishing weighted time-average in Eq. (6), the converse need not be true. Hence our formulations have been cognizant of the fact that the mere non-vanishing of f(t') for some values of t' belonging to the given time-interval does not guarantee a non-vanishing weighted time-average. 3. Does Dirac's Functional Dependence of the Preacceleration on Later Forces Qualify At ALL as Causal EVEN Symmetrically, Let Alone Asymmetrically? Suppose that an entirely putative Newtonian retro- causalist were to invoke the Newtonian Eq. (11) as a basis for the following contention: Forces applied to a particle only after time t so as to generate a non-zero time-integral in Eq. (11) act retrocausally by sending a signal backwards in time, "telling" the particle that 187</page><page sequence="24">ADOLF GRUNBAUM they will act on it after time t, and the particle "responds" to this signal by exhibiting a non-zero PREVELOCITY at the earlier time t. I assume that the proponents of electrodynamic retrocausation would endorse my rejection of such putative retrocausal production of Newtonian prevelocities as altogether wrong-headed. But it is essential that we also agree in our justification of the verdict of wrong- headedness. Hence let me offer a justification for this indictment. Before I do so, I must emphasize, however, that my case against the retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's theory does not rest on my reductio ad absurdum argument from the putative retrocausal produc- tion of Newtonian prevelocities. Instead, the role of my reductio is didactic or expository. The stated putative contention of Newtonian retrocausation is wrong-headed for precisely the same reason which vitiates as altogether unsound the following claim of forward causation: Forces applied to a particle only before time t so as to generate a non-zero time-integral in Eq. (12) act causally by sending a signal forward in time, "telling" the particle that they have already acted on it before time t, and the particle "responds" to this by exhibiting a non-zero postvelocity at time t. Exactly what is there in Newton's theory that shows it to be alike ill-conceived (a) to attribute a non-zero prevelocity as such to the retrocausal action of later applied forces, and (b) to attribute a non-zero postvelocity as such to the temporally forward causal action of earlier forces? The nub of the error, committed alike in both of these causal attributions (a) and (b) here, lies in having overlooked that Newton's laws repudiate the following rival neo-Aristotelian assumption: A non-zero velocity is causally dependent as such on the action of a non-zero force. And just how is this repudiation of causal dependence rendered by Newton's laws? As is of course well-known and shown by the purely lawlike Eq. (9), in Newton's mechanics a non-zero time-integral of the force fails to qualify-on the strength of a physical law alone-as eithera necessary or a sufficient condition for a particle's possession of a non-zero VELOCITY as such at any one given time t. Instead, a non-zero time-integral of the force is by itself a lawfully necessary and sufficient condition for the endurance of a non-zero CHANGE of velocity or acceleration by a given kind of particle. Thus, suppose that we are given an initial particle velocity of zero. At the risk of being quite misleading, the causal production of a change in velocity by the applied forces from the de facto given zero value to some non-zero value can then be described elliptically by omitting mention of the given initial condition of rest and saying the following: The applied forces caused the particle to have a certain 188</page><page sequence="25">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS non-zero final velocity. But this ellipsis must not be taken as warrant for the claim that in Newton's theory non-zero forces themselves are external causes of non-zero velocities as such. By the same token, since we saw it to be given as a mere boundary condition in Dirac's theory that, for every particle, the initial acceleration is zero in the absence of applied forces, it will turn out that non-zero Diracian forces themselves are no more the causes of non-zero electrodynamic accelerations as such than non-zero Newtonian forces themselves are causes of non-zero velocities as such. Mutatis mutandis, our caveat concerning elliptical statements therefore applies to causal statements regarding Diracian accelerations. I shall wish to apply the causal moral of the Newtonian repudiation of neo-Aristotelian mechanics to an analysis of electrodynamic causation in Dirac's theory. Hence let me point out that we are concerned with the following particular kind of cause: An external dynamical agency which is a cause in the sense of causally inducing a perturbation or alteration in the spontaneous states which the particle would otherwise exhibit. Since it is this notion of cause which is invoked in the retrocausal interpreta- tion of Dirac's theory, it is irrelevant whether or not it coheres with the socalled "ordinary" concept of cause, even assuming that there is such a unitary ordinary concept at all. Let us recall from Subsection (i) that the Newtonian and Diracian dynamical theories are addressed to repeatedly instantiable process- types in which the distinction between laws and boundary conditions is not blurred. Using the Newtonian repudiation of neo-Aristotelian dynamical causality as a paradigm, I claim that in dynamical theories which provide scope for this distinction, the following requirement captures a necessary condition which must be met by any causal dependence of a non-zero quantitative property P of a particle on non-zero external perturbational forces themselves: If the application of non-zero external forces to a given kind of particle is to qualify as an external cause or as the external cause of the particle's possession of the property P as such, then their application must be either a necessary or a sufficient condition for the particle's possession of P on the strength of a pertinent physical LAW ALONE without any value of a constant of integration, i.e., WITHOUT any invocation of particular, lawfully-extraneous boundary conditions. Failing that, the application of the non-zero forces to the particle is not even symmetrically causally connected to its possession of P, let alone an asymmetric cause or the asymmetric cause of P! How, I ask, could this necessary condition for a dynamic causal linkage be rejected amid explicating the rationale of the Newtonian repudiation of a causal connection between a non-zero force itself 189</page><page sequence="26">ADOLF GRUNBAUM and a non-zero velocity as such? Note that my necessary condition discredits the causal attribution of a non-zero velocity as such to the action of a non-zero Newtonian force by respectively yielding and accommodating the following claims: It is not the particular non-zero numerical value of the velocity which can be causally attributed to specified non-zero forces themselves; instead what can be causally attributed to such non-zero forces themselves is the non-zero change (or, in the instantaneous case, the time-rate of change) in the value of the velocity as between two times to and t. Thus specified non-zero forces themselves, i.e., without an extraneous boundary condition as to the value of the velocity at time to, are "legally incompetent" to affect the particular value v(t) of the velocity at time t. And since specified non-zero forces thus cannot ever be "lawfully responsible" for the particular value of v(t) as such, the latter cannot be causally attributed to them when it is non-zero. The followers of Galileo and Newton were at pains to explain these points to the neo-Aristotelians. Let us be mindful of the aforestated crucial differences which result from the fact that the Newtonian equation of motion is only of the second order in the time-derivatives of the position vector, whereas the AL-law of motion is of the third order in these time-derivatives. Then we can see why I shall be at pains to make the following point to the electrodynamic retrocausalists: IN DIRAC'S ELECTRO- DYNAMICS, NON-ZERO ACCELERATIONS AS SUCH ARE NOT CAUSALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO EARLIER, LATER OR SIMUL- TANEOUS FORCES, BECAUSE NON-ZERO ELECTRODYNA- MIC ACCELERATIONS AS SUCH ARE NOT CAUSALLY CON- NECTED AT ALL TO THE APPLIED FORCES. Hence the retro- causal interpretation of Dirac's classical electrodynamics is false. But what if the electrodynamic retrocausalists were to argue that the condition for dynamic causal connection on which I shall base this conclusion is not, in fact, a necessary condition as I claim it to be? Then I would challenge them to give a rival sufficient condition for dynamic causal connection which meets the following demand: The putative condition can certify that the functional dependence of acceleration on force in Dirac's Eq. (13) is causal-and indeed is asymmetrically causal !-without also having to countenance the absurd retrocausal interpretation of the Newtonian Equations (11) and (11*). In short, I would challenge the electrodynamic retrocausalists to show how a non-zero force can be a cause such that it is not itself a cause of Newtonian non-zero velocities, but is itself a cause of non-zero accelerations as such in both Diracian and Newtonian dynamics. I do not see that the retrocausalist can meet this challenge at all 190</page><page sequence="27">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS by correctly calling attention to the following important difference between the boundary conditions in Newtonian dynamics and those of Diracian electrodynamics: In Newton's theory, initial velocities are "negotiable" in the sense of not being restricted to particular values and of being allowed to be different for various particles of equal mass, whereas for a given f(t), Dirac's derivation of Eq. (13) is based on restricting the initial acceleration of all particles of equal mass and equal charge to one particular value. In short, I claim it to be true but unavailing to the retrocausalist that the values of de facto physically realized initial accelerations of charged particles can be said to be part of Dirac's theory in the latter sense, whereas initial values of the velocities of neutral mass particles are not similarly part of Newton's theory. Important and interesting though it is in other respects, the fact that the Diracian boundary condition is thus an integral part of his theory does not affect its non-lawlikeness because its dynamical status is tantamount to being the value of a constant of integration. Hence the presence of the boundary condition within Dirac's theory does not enable Diracian external forces to qualify as dynamical causes of non-zero accelerations as such. In other words, though Dirac's prescription of the value of the initial acceleration has the status of a universal statement, its role within his theory is that of an accidental rather than nomic or lawlike universal. And it would thus be unsound rather than merely misleading to describe his universal statement as a "lawlike" specification of the value of a constant of integration! Incidentally, in stark contrast to the Newton- ian lawlike determination of the acceleration by the force alone, the value of the initial acceleration is needed in Eq. (6) to enable the forces there to determine the acceleration v(t). Moreover, even if the status of Dirac's prescription of the initial acceleration were held to be moot such that the Diracian forces could at least arguably be held to be related to the preacceleration by the symmetric causal relation CC in Eq. (13), this would still be quite unavailing to the retrocausalist thesis. For the latter requires much more strongly that the Diracian forces stand in the asymmetric relation Cto the pre-accel- eration. But even in the context of Newton's theory, the claim of an asymmetric relation C between force and acceleration is at best undemonstrated despite its volitional, anthropomorphic plausibility. Recall that in the context of Newtonian mechanics, we were able to use the purely lawlike Eqs. (9) and (10) as a basis for establishing the following two results: (1) Since Eq. (11) is not purely law-like, its asserted functional dependence of the velocity on the time-integral of the later forces does not qualify as a causal dependence, and thus Eq. (11) cannot be validly adduced to attribute non-zero preve- 191</page><page sequence="28">ADOLF GRUNBAUM locities as such to the retrocausal action of later forces, and (2) since Eq. (12) is not purely lawlike, its asserted functional dependence of the velocity on the time-integral of the earlier forces does not qualify as a causal dependence, and thus Eq. (12) cannot be validly adduced to attribute non-zero postvelocities as such to the temporally forward causal action of earlier forces. Quite analogously, in the context of Diracian electrodynamics, I shall be able to use our previously given analysis of the purely lawlike Eqs. (6) or (7) to establish the following: Since Eq. (13) is not purely lawlike, its asserted functional dependence of the ACCELERATION on the weighted time-average of the later forces does not qualify as a causal depen- dence, and therefore Eq. (13) cannot be validly invoked to attribute non-zero preaccelerations as such to the retrocausal action of later forces. A corresponding statement would hold mutatis mutandis for the functional dependence given by the electrodynamic homologue of the Newtonian Eq. (12), which would result from imposing Dirac's boundary condition on the infinite past, rather than on the infinite future. Yet precisely the stated claim of retrocausation is made by reference to the relativistic counterpart of our Eq. (13) in the otherwise beautiful and illuminating book by F. Rohrlich ([9], pp. 22, 151). Speaking of the relativistic Lorentz-Dirac counterpart of our non-relativistic AL-law of motion, Rohrlich says first: Another difficulty of the Lorentz-Dirac equation is related to causality. It appears that the physical solution [i.e., the particular solution resulting from the exclusion of the relativistic run-away velocities at to = oc] leads to a violation of causality over very short time intervals; e.g., an acceleration occurs prior to the applied force. It seems difficult to accept a theory which leads to such results. ([9], p. 22) Even before we see how Rohrlich articulates what he means by causality violation here, my immediate reaction to this expression of intellectual discomfiture is as follows: Just as it would be ill-con- ceived to indict the prevelocities countenanced by the Galilean-New- tonian mechanics as violations of causality merely because they contravene the neo-Aristotelian claim of a causal nexus between force and velocity, so it is ill-conceived to view Dirac's preaccelerations as violations of the principle that "a cause cannot suceed its effect," merely because preaccelerations contravene the generalized Newtonian claim that there must be a causal nexus between force and acceleration. Rohrlich elaborates for us three distinct senses of causality ([9], pp. 50-51). And he maintains that Dirac's preacceleration violates 192</page><page sequence="29">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS causality in the third of these senses, a sense which requires for example "the absence of signals sent backward in time (with velocity c c to be sure)" ([9], p. 151). Using "r" as the time variable, Rohrlich denotes the relativistic acceleration by "a-(T)." And the reasoning offered by him for making this claim of causality violation is as follows: Assume that there is a force acting on the particle only during the time interval 0: T, &lt; T' &lt; 2. As is obvious from (6-74) [i.e. from the relativistic counterpart of our Eq. (13)], a nonvanishing acceleration at a time T &lt; T is then possible, since the whole future motion contributes to a-(7). Thus, it appears as though the force at time 7' E 0 [here, of course, "E" denotes the set-theoretical relation of membership] had sent a signal along the world line (backward in time), telling the particle that it will act on it at a later time; the particle responds to this and shows a (T) i 0 for T &lt; 0 [misprint: Rohrlich means instead T &lt; T,]. Such a preacceleration seems indeed to be a violation of causality (in the third meaning of causality). ([9], p. 151) But a signal connecting two world-points on a (time-like) world line is a causal chain linking two events. Thus Rohrlich is telling us here that a signal provides a causal connection linking the preacceleration to the forces applied during the later time interval 0. Moreover, to assert that the signal from the force is "telling" the particle something to which it "responds" is to assert that the application of the force stands in the asymmetric causal relation C to the acceleration. In just this asymmetric causal vein, Rohrlich speaks of "the effective force responsible for the acceleration" ([9], p. 149) and characterizes the "preacceleration phenomenon" as "the effect" which the "particle experiences . . . prior to the action of the force" ([9], p. 177). As against Rohrlich's claim of the existence of a causal connection between the non-zero preacceleration and the subsequent application of forces, I now put forward a series of considerations under the headings (a)-(e). (a) Let us note first by reference to Eq. (6) what can be said about the connection, if any, in Dirac's theory, between the acceleration of a charged particle at a time t and forces applied to it before t. Assume that the weighted time-average of the applied forces is non-zero during an EARLIER time-interval t -&lt; t' &lt; t. As we saw in Section 2, the earlier application of such non-zero forces is nonetheless itself neither lawfully necessary nor lawfully sufficient for the particle's possession of a non-zero acceleration v(t) at the later instant t. And we illustrated by reference to Newtonian mechanics that, in classical physics, the failure of non-zero forces to qualify as either a lawfully 193</page><page sequence="30">ADOLF GRUNBAUM sufficient or necessary condition for the particle's possession of an attribute P assures the absence of a causal connection between their application and the obtaining of P. It follows that in Dirac's electro- dynamics, earlier non-zero applied forces fail to be causally connected to a later non-zero acceleration, where the relation of causal connection is the symmetric relation CC of our Introduction. By precisely the same reasoning, it follows mutatis mutandis that the application of non-zero forces during the later time-interval t &lt; t' &lt; t2 fails to stand even in the symmetric relation CC to the occurrence of a non-zero acceleration v(t) at the earlier instant t. Thus, in regard to the stated non-existence of the causal relation CC between the applied forces and a non-zero acceleration as such, there is complete time-symmetry. In the light of the conclusion just reached, I clearly do not confine my denial of a causal connection to the temporally special Diracian case of later forces and a non-zero preacceleration. Thus, the time- symmetry of my denial alone shows that I can hardly be accused of having begged the question of retrocausation, as is done by those who seek to discount it irrelevantly on the basis of the fact that any relatively appreciable amount of preacceleration is too short-lived to be detected by a classical apparatus. (b) As explained in Section 1, the assertion xCy is logically stronger than the claim xCCy. If "x" represents the collective event of the application of non-zero forces after time t, and if "y" denotes the non-zero preacceleration event at time t, then the upshot of (a) can be stated as being that xCCy is false. And since xCy unilaterally entails xCCy, I can now deduce that, a fortiori, the claim xCy made by the thesis of electrodynamic retrocausation is false. Yet there is widespread-even if only grudging and rueful-acceptance of the false claim xCy of the retrocausation thesis on the grounds that Eq. (13) shows it to be true. Writers who fancy themselves as appreciating the relevant differences between Newton's second law of motion and the AL-law nonetheless find themselves driven to espousing electrodynamic retrocausation, because they inveterately invoke the Newtonian causal connection between non-zero force and non-zero acceleration when they interpret the mathematical dependence of acceleration on force in Eq. (13) as being a causal dependence as well. Thus we are told that if an electron has never been subjected to a force until a pulse of electromagnetic radiation first reaches it at a time T, then this pulse must be held to have "set the electron in motion" at some earlier time t. And the false belief that Eq. (13) legitimates and indeed requires this interpretation has driven the writers in question to embrace the retrocausal interpretation. But it is instruc- tive to see now specifically why it is multiply wrong to think that 194</page><page sequence="31">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS the causal efficacy of the above Diracian pulse of radiation takes the form of "setting the electron in motion." 1. Given that the force exerted on the electron by the above pulse of radiation generates a non-zero value of the integral f- e - " f(t') dt', Eq. (13) tells us that the electron has been preaccelerating throughout the entire infinite past before T, even though the amount of the preaccleration was appreciable for only a very short time. Thus, the electron will have been accelerating at all times X such that -x &lt; T &lt; T. Hence there never was any ONSET of a non-zero acceleration. And for this reason alone, it is wrong-headed to think that the action of the pulse took the form of setting the electron in motion, even if the electron instantaneously had a zero velocity at some time or other. By way of analogy, if a neutral Newtonian mass particle has been undergoing linear simple harmonic motion for all times T before T, it would be quite unsound to say that this neutral particle has ever been set into motion by the Newtonian force of restitution which acts on it. And such an assertion would be unsound, notwithstanding the fact that the latter Newtonian particle has an instantaneously zero velocity whenever it reverses the direction of its linear motion. Returning to the Diracian context, what can be said validly in this connection is the following: As we saw at the very end of Section 2, given that the asymptotic boundary condition is imposed and hence Eq. (13) is assumed to be true, if no forces ever act on the charged particle during the time interval t - T &lt; o, then v(t) = 0. Hence non-zero forces are a merely defacto necessary condition for a non-zero acceleration. But recall that in Eq. (13) non-vanishing future forces are not even a de facto sufficient condition for a non-zero value of v(t)! 2. Under (c) below, we shall articulate the causal efficacy of Diracian forces by explaining just what kind of changes are wrought by them. But I have already explained that whatever the causal efficacy of Diracian-as distinct from Newtonian-forces, the one thing they themselves do not accomplish causally is imparting non-zero accelera- tions as such to charged particles. Yet precisely this accomplishment is wrongly attributed to them by the declaration that the above electromagnetic pulse "set the electron in motion" before it reached the electron. (c) Suppose it were asked "If the non-zero forces are not causally linked to the particle's non-zero acceleration, to what property of the particle, if any, are they related purely as a matter of physical law?" In other words, just what form does the causal efficacy of Diracian forces take? If such non-zero forces do not produce changes of velocity when they act on a charged particle, what other kind 195</page><page sequence="32">ADOLF GRUNBAUM of changes does their action effect? To answer this question, rewrite the purely lawlike Eq. (6) as follows: 1 ft e-t/lE (t) - e-to/E ? O(to) =- e-t/ f(t) dt' (14) em to It is clear from the purely lawlike Eq. (14) that a non-vanishing weighted time-average of the applied forces is lawfully necessary and sufficient for a non-zero value of the magnitude represented by the l.h.s. of Eq. (14). And note that this magnitude does not constitute a property possessed by the charged particle at any one time such as t; instead the magnitude in question might be said to be the CHANGE in the time-weighted (not just time-dependent) acceleration during the time interval between to and t. Here again we must note that to may be either earlier than t or later than t; accordingly the time integral on the r.h.s. of Eq. (14) is to be taken over the earlier or later forces respectively. And apart from the significant presence of the exponential time-weighting factor, Eq. (14) is quite analogous to the Newtonian Eq. (10) as follows: In Eq. (14) here the accelerations v(to) and v(t) play the role played by the velocities at the different times to and t in Eq. (10). (d) Suppose that someone were to put the question "Since no forces are applied to a charged preaccelerating particle until after the instant t, what other than the later forces does cause the preacceleration in a case described by Eq. (13)? In response, let us first point out to the interlocutor that the question he is addressing to the AL-electro- dynamics is predicated on an assumption which is denied by that very theory: The assumption that the mere occurrence of a non-zero acceleration as such lawfully requires the action or intervention of an external agency or perturbational cause at all! And then we can go on to point out further that the question just posed is therefore fully as question-beggingly ill-conceived as the following question: If the forces applied to a neutral Newtonian mass particle after instant t are not the cause of a non-zero prevelocity exhibited by it at time t, then what does cause that prevelocity in a case described by Eq. (11)? Even brief reflection on the logical defects of the latter question can serve as prophylaxis against asking the former, or at least as an antidote to the former once it has been misguidedly asked. For just as Newtonian physics disavowed the neo-Aristotelian notion that non-zero velocities as such lawfully require external or perturba- tional causes, so classical electrodynamics denies-in the case of charged particles-that non-zero accelerations as such lawfully re- quire external agencies as perturbational causes. 196</page><page sequence="33">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS (e) Even if it could be shown that the later force(s) and the preacceleration do stand in the symmetric causal relation CC, how has Rohrlich or anyone even tried to establish furthermore that they also stand in the asymmetric causal relation C? Clearly, it is the latter stronger claim which the electrodynamic retrocausalists must try to sustain. Yet when Earman uncritically reports the possibility of retrocausation as an upshot of the "Dirac-Plass theory," he offers us no more than the blithe declamation "I believe that 'causes' is the right word," upon saying that "an impulsive force causes . . a particle to accelerate before the pulse arrives" ([4], p. 41). Are the electrodynamic retrocausalists tacitly taking it to require no argument that in Newton's law F= ma, the application of the force at a given time t does indeed stand in the asymmetric causal relation C to the simultaneously occurring acceleration? If so, are they perhaps gaining plausibility for this unsubstantiated assumption of causal asymmetry by trading on the anthropomorphism that some accelerations ensue from volitions to exert forces muscularly? And could it be that having tacitly made their unsubstantiated assumption of causal asymmetry, the retrocausalists go on to misextrapolate this assumption from the Newtonian mechanics of neutral mass particles to the classical Diracian electrodynamics of charged particles? Until and unless these proponents of electrodynamic retrocausation explicitly come to grips with these questions, one can only guess at their underlying reasoning. But whatever their reasoning, I have argued that their conclusion is not only unfounded but false. For I articulated the philosophical import of Dirac's crucial invocation of a futuristic asymptotic boundary condition in his deduction of Eq. (13) from the AL-law of Eq. (6). And on the basis of that philosophical import, I believe I have demonstrated the following: Mathematical retrodetermination of the preacceleration by the later forces in Eq. (13) is NOT tantamount to retrocausation, any more than the corresponding mathematical retrodetermination of Newtonian prevelocities in Eq. (11) can validly attest to the retrocausal production of these prevelocities by later forces. Now the requirement by means of which Dirac interdicts the relativistic run-away solutions is no less a boundary condition in that theory than the initial acceleration which he required in the non-relati- vistic theory is a de facto condition in the latter theory. And by parity of reasoning, the retrocausal interpretation of the relativistic counterpart to our non-relativistic Diracian Eq. (13) can also be shown to be false. In conclusion, the preceding analysis of Rohrlich's version of the retrocausal interpretation of Dirac's preacceleration readily permits 197</page><page sequence="34">ADOLF GRUNBAUM me to assess the following contention of Earman's: ". . . in the Dirac-Plass theory of classical relativistic electrodynamics . . . a coherent mechanism for the production of traces of the future is at hand" ([4], p. 41). Earman's claim is part of a wider network of theses with some of which I have dealt recently in detail in Ch. 22, ?4 of my book [6].4 But let us see now how Earman amplifies 4One of Earman's theses which I did not discuss there pertains to the status of traces which permit retrodictive rather than predictive inferences. Hence here I wish to supplement what I said there in [6] by commenting on his criticism ([4], pp. 43-44) of my account of the inductive reasoning underlying the logic of just one type of paradigm case of a retrodictive inference based on traces. In the first (1963) edition of [6], which is reproduced in the first 446 pages of [6] with the same pagination, I had discussed on pp. 235-236 the one type of paradigmatic inference from the evidence of footprint-shaped marks in the sand of a beach to the conclusion that a man had walked on the beach. Citing these two pages from my 1963 edition, Earman ([4], pp. 43-44) then offers two criticisms-(i) and (ii)-of my entropic account there of the inductive reasoning underlying this retrodictive inference of a past incursion of the beach. I need not discuss his criticism (i) here, since I had already offered it myself in the Appendix (?22) of the 1973 edition, where I had written: On p. 235, the analysis of the role of entropic considerations in retrodictive inferences suggests quite misleadingly that past interactions of a rather detailed kind can be inferred from the specified entropic information alone. But without premisses going beyond the latter information, the entropically-vouchsafed retro- dictive inference of a past interaction of the system with an outside agency cannot yield the conclusion that the outside agency which interacted with the beach system was a stroller. ([6], p. 829) Earman states his criticism (ii) as follows: . . it is true that statistical mechanics justifies an assertion to the effect that for a properly chosen A, the probability of an appearance of a footprint-like shape F after a period A given that the beach was near equilibrium at time t = 0 and remained a quasi-closed system C until t = A, is very low. Symbolically, we can write (oa) p(F,CX) &lt; 0.5 where X represents the background information about the size and disposition of the beach. It does not follow from this, however, that (p) p(-C,FX) &gt; 0.5 which seems to be necessary for Griinbaum's conclusion.... Only if other probabilities are known can conclusions of the form (f3) be derived. Suppose for example that (y) p(F,CX) &lt; p(F,-CX) Applying Bayes' theorem to both sides of this inequality, we obtain p(F,X) x p(C,FX) p(F,X) x p(-C,FX) (8) p(C,X) p(-C,X) If we further assume that p(-C,X) &gt; p(C,X) i.e. p(C,X) &lt; 0.5, then we can conclude that p(-C,FX) &gt; p(C,FX) i.e. p(-C,FX) &gt; 0.5, which is (r3). But in many cases, p(C,X) may not satisfy the condition used in this derivation; in 198</page><page sequence="35">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS his claim of advance trace formation. He writes: if feature f is a trace of events e, then the occurrence of e must be a cause of the appearance of f. . . . Consider, for example, an inscription which records the correct prediction of the position of Mars at some future time. If we do not want to call this inscription a trace of the future (and neither Smart nor I do) it seems to me it must be because we believe that the future position of Mars does not have any causal influence on the production of the inscription .... it follows that if there could fact, the background information X which Robinson Crusoe possessed would seem to justify just the opposite assumption, i.e. that p(C,X) &gt; 0.5. ([4], p. 44) Earman then reaches the following assessment: The arguments of (i) and (ii) indicate that Griinbaum has not correctly presented the logic of this retrodictive inference. ([4], p. 44) We see that Earman takes me to have inferred the conclusion (P) from the premiss (oa) alone, a deduction which would be a non-sequitur. He then points out that (3) is validly deducible from the conjunction of premisses (cx) and (y) with the further premiss (E) p(C,X)&lt; 0.5. And Earman adds that in the particular situation in which Robinson Crusoe found himself, there were good grounds for accepting the negation of (E). But I find it astonishing that Earman takes no cognizance at all of the following fact: On the very first of the two pages of my text which he cited, I had affirmed the inequality in premiss (e) by explicitly treating the beach-system as one which is just temporarily isolated in Reichenbach's sense of being a "branch system." Thus, one of the premisses which I offered there ([6], p. 235) as "justification for the inference of the past incursion of the beach" was that "most systems which we now encounter in an isolated state of relatively low entropy, behaving as if they might remain isolated, neither were in fact permanently closed in the past nor will remain isolated indefinitely in the future." And, amid emphasizing that I was talking about improbabilities "within a space ensemble of branch-systems" ([6], p. 236), I had gone on to say that one of the other premisses of the retrodictive inference is "the assumption that a transition from an earlier high entropy state to a presently given low one [F] is overwhelmingly improbable in a system while it is isolated" ([6], pp. 235-6). The point of my having written "isolated" in italics rather than without italics was to assert the following: When the beach system is not isolated, then a transition of the beach from a near equilibrium state to the state F is either not improbable or at least not nearly as improbable as when it is isolated. Hence I submit that with the modicum of charity needed to allow for the point of my italicization, my additional avowed premiss will be read to assert not only the claim which Earman calls "(a)" but also the claim which he calls "(y)". And we saw that I had already affirmed (E). Thus, in view of the deducibility of (3) from the conjunction of (a) and (y) with (E)-and indeed from (y) and (E) without (a()- it is seen that, contrary to Earman, my deduction of (3) was valid, although I did not formally symbolize the pertinent probability statements. Earman's symbolization of these statements and his invocation of the equivalence of (y) and (8) are quite helpful, however, in making the validity of the deduction perspicuous. 199</page><page sequence="36">ADOLF GRUNBAUM be backward (i.e. future to past) causation of a certain type, then there could be traces of the future. ... A possible mechanism for backward causation is contained in the Dirac-Plass theory of classical relativistic electrodynamics. According to this theory, an impulsive force causes (I believe that 'causes' is the right word) a particle to accelerate before the pulse arrives. ... a coherent mechanism for the production of traces of the future is at hand. ([4], p. 41) Note Earman's example of the correct prediction of the future position of Mars. In that example, he himself rightly points out a significant requirement for being a trace of the future as follows: If x and y are events such that x &lt;, y and x allows the correct prediction of y, this hardly suffices to qualify x as the advance-trace of y, unless it is also true that yCx. But I have shown that Dirac's preacceleration does not stand in the asymmetric causal relation E to the future forces, because it does not even stand in the weaker symmetric causal relation CC to them. Hence, contrary to Earman, I maintain that Dirac's preacceleration is not a trace of the later application of forces, any more than the inscription of a correct prediction of the position to be occupied by Mars at some future time is a trace of Mars' future state. And Earman grants that the inscription is not produced retrocausally. Thus, I contend that just like Earman's inscription, electrodynamic preacceleration has predictive significance without retrocausal signifi- cance as follows: If we are given Dirac's futuristic assumption of his asymptotic boundary condition and that no forces are acting on a charged particle at a time t, then the particle's possession of a non-zero acceleration at the time t allows the prediction-via Eq. (13)-that non-zero forces will be acting on it at some later time. And it is abundantly clear by now that this Diracian state of affairs no more illustrates the existence of advance traces of the future than does the following Newtonian commonplace, previously noted a propos of Eq. (10): If we are given the "futuristic" boundary condition that a Newtonian mass particle will be at rest (v= 0) at some time to later then t and that no force is acting on the particle at the time t, then the particle's possession of a non-zero velocity at t allows the prediction that non-zero forces will be acting on it at some later time(s) between t and to. One can quite agree with Earman to the following very limited extent: If retrocausation should turn out to be a bona fide conceptual possibility, then "the question of whether backward causation exists in nature is a question which must be settled not by armchair 200</page><page sequence="37">MYTH OF RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS philosophers but by natural philosophers" ([4], p. 41). Yet Earman's uncritical depiction of Dirac's preacceleration as an example of retrocausation is a case of an armchair philosopher misinterpreting what a natural philosopher has wrought. Dirac's contribution to classical electrodynamics-relativistic and non-relativistic-constitutes a great scientific achievement. But its import for the conceptual let alone physical possibility of retrocausation is nil. REFERENCES [1] Csonka, P. L. "Advanced Effects in Particle Physics, I."
