<plain_text><page sequence="1">PSYCHOLOGY1 IN the following pages, we intend not so much to make a complete review of the results achieved by psychol ogy in French-speaking countries since 1914, as to indicate the principal currents of psychological thought which char acterize the works published during that period. As we are not concerned here with questions connected with pedagogy (child psychology or vocational guidance) Aior with religious or esthetic psychology, we may group our remarks under four principal heads: general psychol ogy, abnormal psychology, physiological and animal psy chology, and problems closely connected with psychology. General Psychology Just as we can reach biology through anatomy, physiol ogy or embryology, so we can also distinguish three main currents, at present, in general psychology : the structural, the functional and the genetic tendencies. If it is interest ing to make such distinctions it is because one definitely feels thai the psychologists who adopt one or the other of these orientations have very different views as to what constitutes explanation in psychology. It is certain that the psychology written in French during these last years Mas remained faithful to the general ideal of contemporary psychology, i. e., the ideal of being a positive, autonomous 1 Translated from the French by Marthe Sturm, Smith College, Northamp ton, Mass.</page><page sequence="2">PSYCHOLOGY science, distinct especially from general philosophy. In this respect Th. Ribot's influence remains a living one. But it seems that the meaning of this rally cry has notably changed during these last years and that psychological methods have become more flexible. For Ribot, probably, the independence of psychology from metaphysics meant the progressive reduction of psychological to physiological phenomena. At least, the well-known principle of psycho physical parallelism would not have aroused so many dis cussions if it had not been considered as a weapon in the hands of physiologists. During the last few years, on the other hand, there has been a stronger and stronger tend ency towards the complete autonomy of psychology, and the theory of parallelism now seems to be interpreted by every one in the manner some time ago set forth by Flour noy, whose work on this subject has just been republished.2 Flournoy declared psycho-physical parallelism an easy way to avoid discussion about mind and body and to permit the collaboration of physiologists and psychologists without confusion of their respective fields. Indeed, the principle of parallelism offers to both groups of scientists guaran ties and freedom of action : if it establishes a parallelism, it also denies any identification or causal connexion as re gards the two series, psychical and physiological. But even though the contemporary psychologists writing in French agree in considering psychology a positive science, they, however, by no means accept the same underlying meta physics. In spite of their implicit systems of philosophy, which are further divergent than ever, they agree to use, as the only possible method of psychology, observation and experimentation, to the exclusion of any kind of ontology. From this point of view Dumas' conclusion, in his Trait? 2 Th. Flournoy, M?taphysique et Psychologie, 2nd edition, preface by H. Hoeffding, Geneva and Paris, 1919.</page><page sequence="3">432 THE MONIST de Psychologie* is most interesting. He shows how dif ferent are the philosophical tendencies of his contributors and insists on the consequently greater value of their agreement on purely psychological problems. Such being the case it is easy to understand why some of the authors tend preferably towards structural analysis, others towards functional analysis and a third group towards genetic in vestigation. It is because of their underlying philosophies. Some do not expect any interpretation except in terms of the human mind itself, while others count on some more or less distant physiological explanation. During the last ten years the leader in structural psy chology has been H. Delacroix. M. Delacroix plays a very interesting part in the psychology of French-speak ing countries. He has attempted to maintain the integrity of the realm of psychology against the encroachments of physiology on the one hand and of sociology on the other. That is the reason why his method is one of structural analysis. It is the favorite method of rationalism: to ex plain the human mind by reference to itself and to distrust any kind of "mental chemistry" that would seek the origin of mind in something other than itself. Therefore M. Del acroix remains wisely on his guard against all genetic formulations. These ordinarily tend either to explain psy chological facts in infra-psychical, i. e., physiological, terms, or to trace them back to supra-individual, i. e., to sociological, phenomena. We are here not concerned with religious psychology. But La religion et la foi* is a highly significant book from the viewpoint of method. Against genetic methods M. Delacroix raises three kinds of objections. In the first place, the concept of evolution is obscure. Secondly, the 3 Trait? de Psychologie, 2 vol., Alean, 1924. G.

Thirdly, the permanent conditions of the possibility of a phenome non give us better information concerning it than any gen etic hypothesis, for this latter is pseudo-explanation. Against the sociological theories, Delacroix asserts the ex istence of a human mind anterior and superior to society, or at least of an individual infra-structure that makes pos sible the blossoming of social phenomena. These principles have since been applied by M. Delacroix to the problem of the relation between language and thought.5 The result represents a masterly analysis of this difficult question. Against the almost purely sociological tendency of French-speaking linguists (they are influenced by the school of de Saussure) Delacroix shows the indis pensable relation between linguistics and psychology. Lan guage is indeed a social product, but its functional condi tions, its affective roots, and above all its rationality can only be understood through psychology. This rationality is especially emphasized by M. Delacroix, but without ex aggeration, for, he says, "language oscillates between chaos and a cosmos." Thus Delacroix gives us a new viewpoint regarding language. Psychologists have for a long time considered language as a pure nomenclature, as if things were simply designated by words, and as if, psychologically, words were nothing but auditory or motor images, or the like, in consciousness. Nothing is more superficial than this conception. Language is thought. Every thought proc ess consists in the handling of symbols ; and language is a necessary stage in the elaboration of these symbols. A word is not simply a label. It is a sound, bearer of a mean ing and susceptible of grammatical treatment. This means 6 H. Delacroix, Le langage et la pens?e. Alean, 1924.</page><page sequence="5">434 THE MONIST also that a word is very difficult to isolate. It is not a unit. It constitutes the limit of an intellectual process of separa tion and identification. As to the sentence, it is not a sim ple sum; it is a whole made of reciprocal relations. Lan guage, therefore, presupposes thought. Just as religion is the rational organization of affective data so is language the rationalization of chaotic phonal matter. M. Delacroix, verifies his assertions by studying the acquisition of language by children and the loss of this function in aphasia. But his genetic analysis remains de scriptive. Against the physiologists, he strongly argues that the verbal sign is not a conditioned reflex. Indeed, at first, signs adhere to objects. In order that they may really become "signs," the mind must sever them from the ob jects, must place them in a network of symbols, in that sys tem of relations between symbols which constitutes the very stuff of reason. In Dumas' Trait?, Delacroix gives a complete analysis of intellectual functions, the wealth and subtelty of which are such as to forbid our summarizing it in so short a paper as this, but the general content of which fits entirely into the main lines of the sketch we have just drawn. Another leader in psychological analysis is Paulhan. With the exception of a book which we shall review later, he has published since 1918 only three studies, Le psy chisme inconsicietit* La sensibilit?, l'intelligence, et la vol ont? dans tous les faits psychologiques,1 and Le pr?sent isme.8 In his study of the unconscious, Paulhan continues his researches in the systematization of tendencies. Ten dencies and our coming to consciousness of them are essen tial parts of psychic life, according to Paulhati. Conscious ness, it is true, exercises an influence as a cognitive element. But psychic processes maintain the same nature and func 6 Journal de Psychologie, XVIII. 7 Revue Philosophique, 1920. 8 Journal de Psychologie.</page><page sequence="6">PSYCHOLOGY 435 tioning whether or not they are conscious. The theory of "presentism" set forth in the third mentioned paper, points out the exaggerated predominence in the mine of the pres ent state, whatever it may be?sensation, emotion, or new idea. This preponderance is due to the insufficient or de layed control of former tendencies. Hence certain "pre sentist" characters, such as impulsivity, etc. This idea of Paulhan's leads us to mention, in the field of the analysis of characters, the work of F. Mentre, par ticularly his book, Esp?ces et variet?s d'intelligence, El? ments de noologie? By the term "no?logy" the author means the science of individual types. Binet, Paulhan and others had already raised the problem, but Mentre sug gests new classifications ; these have already been criticized just as Mentre criticized his predecessors. A. Delmas and M. Boll have also discussed the subject in their book on "Human Personality."10 If we now pass from the field of structural to that of functional psychology, we shall find an entirely different source of inspiration. The most remarkable works in this second field are undoubtedly the studies of Claparede on l'Intelligence11 and on la Volont?12, and those of Larguier des Bancels on VEmotion et l'Instinct.13 Claparede is a pure empiricist. Few psychologists are so completely free from philosophical concerns, whether these are rationalistic or "empiristic" in the epistemological sense of the word. Sometimes he is anti-intellectualistic, when facts seem to lead him in that direction ; at other times he is anti-mecha nistic to the extent of seeming to tend towards finalism. The truth is that he grasps phenomena not as a theorist but as a physician. He sees phenomena as moving things, inter woven in their vital context and functioning; wherever a 9 Bonard Paris, 1920. 10 La personnalit?

Furthermore, he is convinced that applications, if not the leaven of any science, are at least the criterion of a conception's fruitfulness. That is why his analyses are always written in a language most apt to describe the process in terms of action and of movement. His paper on intelligence is from this last viewpoint a perfect model of a short sketch. In it he repeatedly empha sizes the vagueness of our present structural knowledge and thus he raises a great number of problems that are most of the time unconsciously veiled. He supplants struc tural knowledge with a functional synthesis as simple as it is charming. Intelligence, says Claparede, responds to a need. "The particular need that arouses intelligence is the need of adaptation which arises whenever the individual is not adapted to environmental circumstances." There are two kinds of behavior that ordinarily adapt the individual to his environment: i. e., instinct or the system of hereditary mechanisms, and habit, the system of acquired associations. But when instincts fail and habits do not work, there is but one other recourse, trial and error. The method of trial and error, observable in the lowest forms of animal life (Jennings) can itself be divided into two stages which to gether constitute intelligence. Trial and error is either purely empirical, i. e., the steps taken are determined by a pseudo-choice made according to external circumstances; or it is systematic, i. e., the choice is determined by the con sciousness of relations. Hence we have empirical intelli gence and intelligence proper. But how does the readjust ment which constitutes intelligence pass from purely empi rical trials to systematized attempts? Here Clarapede's analysis becomes most fruitful because of the problem it suggests. Three periods can be noticed in any intellec</page><page sequence="8">PSYCHOLOGY 437 tuai act.14 First there is a question, i. e., the maladjustment becomes conscious ; then an hypothesis, or the imagination of a solution ; thirdly, control or verification. These three operations are easy enough to describe in functional terms, but what is their mechanism ? By what kind of mechanism does the particular state of consciousness which constitutes the question start and direct the search for a solution ? How do hypotheses arise and follow one another ? What is the nature of that process of rejection and acceptance which constitutes the control ? Without ignoring the value of the fine German works on Denkpsychologie, Claparede empha sizes the fact that in these matters we know nothing; we possess static and structural analysis but we do not under stand the dynamism of the functioning. In an article on the will, as yet unpublished, Claparede makes similar statements. He distinguishes will from in tentional act as he previously distinguished intelligence from instinct. Just as intelligence arises when instincts do not work so will makes its appearance when two inten tions conflict. These contentions have been criticized. Spearman ac cuses Claparede of defining intelligence "by reference to experimentation/' the way in which it appears in children between six and nine years of age. But it is a strength to be able to consider things with enough freshness of mind to forget classical descriptions and to find a language which shows the gaps in our knowledge. It is to this method of procedure that Claparede owes the production of a few very searching pages on la loi de prise de con science.1* Observing that children are more quickly aware of differences than of similarities (though they generalize automatically all the time), he shows how it is maladapta tion that creates consciousness, and from this observation 14 Pillsbury expressed similar ideas in 1910. 15 La conscience de la resemblance et de la difference chez Venfant. Arch, de Psycho!., XVII, 1919.</page><page sequence="9">438 THE MONIST he draws a criticism of habitual ways of speaking, ways that are static and not functional. The recent works of J. Larguier des Bancels, and par ticularly his fine Introduction to Psychology, have a similar orientation. Larguier considers functional descrip tion better for an introductory study, but he thinks that there should be a constant alternation between structural and functional psychology. Such a rhythm, he believes, cannot be anything but useful to the improvement of sci ence. For James, and particularly for McDougall, emotion is but a concomitant, or an affective aspect, of instinct. Lar guier, through a very precise and fine analysis, arrives at the opinion that emotion, while necessarily and closely linked with instinct, is not its affective counterpart but its failure. In other words, it is when instinct fails that emo tion appears; when instinct tends toward useful reaction, emotion is only harmful. Anger is not an adaptive reac tion, a counterpart of the fighting instinct; it is a "brief madness" arising from the failure of that instinct. In stincts are, indeed, adaptive, but only in a general way, without anticipation of all possible cases. It is therefore not strange that they often fail. But, says Larguier, there remains the problem of determining why, in the case of certain individuals called "emotional," instincts miscarry more than in the case of others. There is also the problem of understanding the mechanism of emotion. Why-does the failure of a given instinct take a certain form rather than some other? To such questions Larguier awaits the answer from psychology. There i^ but a step between functional and genetic psy chology, and most psychologists cannot be univocally clas sified. This is particularly true in the case of Pierre Janet whose recent works indicate an extremely interesting com bination of functional psychology and genetic construction.</page><page sequence="10">PSYCHOLOGY 439 A synthesis of these new conceptions of Janet may be found in Dumas' Trait?16 and in three lectures delivered in London.17 Furthermore, the Meditations psychologique (of which we shall speak again when we come to abnormal psychology) are full of allusions to the new ideas of Janet on the hierarchy of tendencies, or the different stages of development. These ideas, if we are well informed, will soon lead to some general study of the question. The works of Janet prior to 1914 are too well known to need mention here. Let us simply indicate the most recent orientation of this versatile and fruitful scholar. The present method of Janet is that of the behavioristic psychology, but of a behaviorism which integrates all the phenomena of consciousness under the head of particular acts. Let us, for example, take the case of memory. Mem ory, says Janet, is an account, i. e., a certain mode of speech relating to an event; it represents the event more or less correctly and was constructed at the time when the other actions called forth by the event were performed.18 From the point of view of the old school of psychology, this is an unbearable paradox, since in order to narrate one should recall. But one nevertheless sees how interest ing Janet's theory is. By making memory a mode of be havior and not a faculty, such a definition emphasizes pre cisely all that which, in a recollection, is arbitrarily con structed and not given; such a theory explains also why the classification and ordering of memories are so slow in the case of children, and depend so much on action, partic ularly on social behavior. This single instance at once shows Janet's present mode of analysis. Janet agrees with Baldwin on the point that most psychological operations 16 La tension psychologique et ses oscillations, Trait? de psychologie, Vol. I, p. 919-952. 17Brit. Journ. of Psych. (Medic. Sect.), Vol. I, Part 1, 3 and 4, and Vol. II, Part 1 (1920, 1921, 1924). 18 Pierre Janet, Les Souvenirs irr?els, Archives de Psychologie, XIX, 1924, p. 14.</page><page sequence="11">440 THE MONIST are internalized social actions : "We repeat with respect to ourselves modes of behavior which have first been con structed Avith reference to others."19 Memory, belief, re flection, logical principles are but accounts, promises of action, discussions, ethical rules, etc., internalized, through repetition within and for ourselves. From this viewpoint language seems to Janet to constitute the fundamental phe nomenon of human psychology: man is a talking animal who talks his actions and acts his words. And, if in truth memory is an internalized narration, reflection, an inter nalized discussion, and belief, a promise, etc., one can see how the genesis of these fundamental operations would not have been possible without speech. But these new views of Janet do not remain isolated and fragmentary. They have enabled him to construct, partic ularly in his courses at the College de France,20 a doctrine that relates to the hierarchy of tendencies and constitutes a general genetic theory of the stages of mental develop ment. The guiding idea is an attempt to classify psycho logical operations by their degree of difficulty, taking as a criterion their order of appearance. In brief, the impor tant stages are the following: reflex stage; social stage characterized by the appearance of imitation ; the elemen tary intellectual stage, marked by the emergence of the perception of relations, and therefore of language, and, along with language, of primitive memory conceived as a narration ; the assertive period or stage of belief ; the period of reflection (which is an inner discussion leading to the summation or synthesis of beliefs) ; the ergatic stage, marked by the appearance of the possibility of work (i. e., work assigned by oneself) ; the rational stage, and finally the experimental one. Now?and it is here that the new ideas of Janet recur to his former conceptions, with reference to the dynamism 19 Ibid., p. 15. 20 See the summaries in VAnnuaire des Cours du College de France.</page><page sequence="12">PSYCHOLOGY 44I of mind?the establishing of these stages is guided by an extremely interesting principle which marks the point of union between pathological and genetic psychology. Each of the stages corresponds to one of the successive strata of mental structure, or, stated more exactly, to one of the successive degrees of psychological tension. This tension may vary. The variations of level are linked with states of depression and excitation, fatigue, age, emotions, etc. But it must be particularly noted that every mental disease is marked by a regression in the hierarchy of tendencies and is thus characterized by a certain level beyond which the mind seems unable to pass. Yet these oscillations of level are not sufficient to characterize a psychological tension: it is necessary to add what Janet calls the variation of the activation degree of the tendency. A tendency may be in a latent stage. It may bring forth a desire, an effort, or a complete action, or give birth to the "derivation" called emotion. Moreover, between a latent state and complete action, the tendency may lead to an interior thought proc ess, a kind of reaction of the subject himself to his own actions, happily compared by Janet to the propriozeptive reflexes of Sherrington. It is the interference of the oscil lations of the degree of activation with the oscillations of the mental level that produces the general oscillations of psychological tension. Among other genetic attempts mention must be made of Ph. Chaslin's works concerning the genesis of mathemati cal concepts. Everybody knows that the Italian psycholo gist Rignano has followed Mach in an interesting concep tion of reasoning considered as a "mental experience." This work was of great interest to the psychiatrist Chaslin whose very rich clinical experience led him to study the pathology and psychology of reasoning. He left a posthu mous study on mathematical reasoning, a few abstracts of which have been published in different reviews.</page><page sequence="13">442 THE MONIST To be mentioned also is a little book by M. Cresson on Les r?actions intellectuelles ?l?mentaires.21 The author at tempts to trace the diverse forms of reasoning to a sort of unconscious analogical reasoning that is constantly mani fest in perception, recollection, etc. Works on educational psychology, which are to be dis cussed elsewhere, naturally contain also several new ideas in the field of genetic psychology. But the great innovation in genetic studies is the appeal made to sociology in explanations of the higher psychologi cal functions. In this regard Baldwin is a forerunner. He has not had as great an influence as he should have had, except on the psychology of Janet. The most important influence came from sociologists themselves, principally from M. Levy-Bruhl. D?rkheim, as is well known, con sidered religion, ethical feelings, personality, logical rea soning, etc., as products of social life conceived as inde pendent of individual consciousness, as external and supe rior to it. It is also known how M. Levy-Bruhl attempted to verify these doctrines in the field of logic, through the study of the judgments and categories peculiar to primitive mentality. These works have deeply impressed the psy chologists writing in French and have directed towards sociological explanations at least two of them : Ch. Blondel and G. Dumas. Ch. Blondel, as he has himself said in an article in the Journal de Psychologie, has been influenced by both Levy Bruhl and Bergson. The former led him to distrust indi vidualistic explanations; the latter taught him the part played by language and therefore by social life in the very structure of intelligence. Thus, since 1914 (as appears by reference to a book to which we shall later refer, La Conscience morbide), Blondel has distinguished two ele ments within the human mind, the purely psychological 21 Alean, 1922.</page><page sequence="14">PSYCHOLOGY 443 and the social. The former comprises all that the mind is unable to integrate either into collective sentiments or into the verbal and conceptual forms due to society. It is, then, the inexpressible : on one hand, the unconscious motor ac tivity and, on the other, the mass of elusive feelings, som atic sensations, etc., which in normal life are completely suppressed or, as Blondel says, d?cant?s in favor of what ever can be socialized or conceptualized. The genesis of the higher psychic functions brings us back, says Blon del, to the history of the socialization of the mind. It is in Dumas' Trait? that the most categorical pages of Blondel on this subject are to be found.22 In a study of the will Blondel begins with a sharp and witty criticism, often exaggerated but always suggestive, of the intro spected experiences in the realm of the will. He praises James for having most clearly seen the sui generis charac ter of the will, but he insists even more strongly than this author upon the mysterious and inexplainable element in the "fiat" if one remains on a purely individualistic plane. Hence his conclusion: the "fiat" is less a decision than a manifestation of obedience?obedience of the individual to the group imperatives. An analysis of personality leads Blondel to similar con clusions. Without society, personality would be reduced to the consciousness of body, to coenesthesia. But, strange to say, this very intimate ego, which is our most individual possession, is also the least personal thing we know. The continual introspection of an Amiel leads only to the reali zation of the strange and the disquieting. "The personal ity that loses itself in the depth of the ego finds itself again only at its surface." It is in plunging into the society of men that we rediscover ourselves. The social ego which at first appears to be most external is thus our real self. Personality is social in character. This paradox is reflected 22 Chapters on Les volitions and La personnalit?, Trait?, Vol. II.</page><page sequence="15">444 THE MONIST also in theories: the psychological theories that have lim ited themselves to the individual alone have always ended by considering the ego an inexplicable datum. Sociology alone permits us to get a glimpse of its genesis. From a different point of view G. Dumas himself comes to similar ideas. With A. Comte he considers mind as a compound of physiological and social elements. It is true that Dumas places himself on ground that is in this respect privileged. He is concerned with the expression of emo - tions. The fine works of Dumas on this subject are well known. They go back beyond 1914. But in his Trait? Dumas has renewed the exposition and has been able to show how empty are certain psychological theories that appeal to fanciful constructions where physiology and social psychology are sufficient for an exhaustive analysis of the facts. These genetic attempts inspired by sociology have from one side or another aroused a rather strong opposition. We have already spoken of the position of Delacroix. In the field of ethical and religious feelings, G. Belot has, in Dumas' Trait?, defended a similar conception, maintain ing the psychological and individual nature of these feel ings. But it is especially in the realm of thinking that the debate becomes more heated. Not to speak of philoso phers who see in "sociologism" a sort of neo-pragmatism that weakens the value of rational principles, psychologists themselves have some difficulty in admitting that all of logic may be the work of society. Touching this subject, I. Meyerson published, in Vann? psychologique, a very in teresting critical study of the "Primitive Mentality" by Levy-Bruhl. According to I. Meyerson, it is not necessary to invoke a kind of non-rational causality in explanation of the phe nomena collected by M. Levy-Bruhl under the name of "mystical causality." We need merely recognize that prim</page><page sequence="16">PSYCHOLOGY 445 itive man, as is only natural, has not yet come to believe in the regularity of the laws of nature, and that he looks upon nature as a vast system where everything is related to everything and kept in an instable balance. Such being the case a rational principle of conservation is sufficient to explain the fact that primitive man clings to traditions and customs which we judge, and which he also sometimes judges, queer and incomprehensible. It is simply that primitive man maintains scrupulously the existing modes of action, for fear the world might collapse, i. e., for fear the slightest change might bring forth some kind of un expected and dangerous result. The apparently non rational element would thus be explained by a very rational principle of conservation. Here let us mention also that M. Paulhan, whose talent as an analyst is well known, has written a book en social transformation of feelings, a book which provides a balance between sociology and psychol ogy.23 Without disregarding the individual nature of feel ings, Paulhan studies their socialization and the spiritual ization which follows from it. The analysis of sexual feel ings is particularly well dene. In the field of social psychology, to which many contem porary scholars have been led through their genetic inter ests, mention must be made of studies on language, the place of which is to be found half way between psychology and sociology. M. Bally has continued his fine studies on stylistic. These inspired G. Vaucher to write a thesis on affective language and judgments of value.24 The Jour nal de Psychologie has devoted to the psychology of lan guage an important brochure with contributions from Meillet, Bally, Vendry?s, Bloch, Sechehaye, and others. 23 Les transformations sociales des sentiments.

Ribot, it would not have been possible before the war to separate abnormal psychology from general psychology. Even now quite a few general systems of psychology lead to abnormal psychology and vice versa. This is particu larly true in the case of the work of P. Janet and Ch. Blon del. Nevertheless on the whole one may say that abnormal psychology, because of the difficulty of the questions raised and the relations of their solutions to medical and physio logical problems, has become in some measure an autono mous science. At any rate the time is past when one could, as Ribot did, devote a lifetime to the study of pathological methods without oneself meeting a single patient. But this does not mean, of course, that Ribot's work as an initi ator has not been necessary and most fruitful. The present status of abnormal psychology in French speaking countries has been very clearly set forth by Dumas in two of the longest chapters of the Trait?. These papers sanction in particular the official victory of the ideas of Babinski?ideas already old?insofar as hysteria is con ceived as simple suggestion. It is true that not all the authors have accepted these ideas with equal conviction. In French Switzerland, Claparede and H. Flournoy, while not maintaining the classical conception in its entirety and while acknowledging with Babinski that the explanation of hysteria is to be found more in psychology than in physi ology, nevertheless assert the authenticity of some dis puted facts. Pierre Janet also refuses to define hysteria in terms of suggestion alone and continues in his last works to defend an original conception of it. In his earlier doc trines, this conception represents an explanation of hyste</page><page sequence="18">PSYCHOLOGY 447 ria by reference to automatism. According to his later conception (behaviorism), automatism is itself quasi action, or action of low tension; in such action the whole personality does not collaborate and the result is that im pulse is stronger than reflection. As regards the hier archy of tendencies or the stages of mental development, hysterical behavior is to be located at the stage of belief and may not be placed on the level of reflection, or the com pensatory synthesis of beliefs. Janet's latest works on abnormal psychology are Les Medications psychologiques25 and M?decine psycholo gique26 In these books Janet presents a very complete his tory and a critique of the different systems of psycho-ther apy and gives a full and extremely rich account of the pro cedures based on the idea of psychological force and its economy, and on the fundamental idea of tension oscilla tions. He is thus led in each case to establish a kind of "budget for the mind." One of the most striking novelties in abnormal psychol ogy is the notion of morbid consciousness due to M. Blon del. Such is the title of a book published in 1914. As already noted, the idea has been the starting point of a movement in general psychology inspired by sociology. Since Claude Bernard, most psychiatrists and even most pathologists in every field have started with the idea that the pathological and the normal are identical in nature and that a simple difference of degree distinguishes disease from normal oscillations. In contrast hereto Blondel states that the morbid consciousness is a psychic reality sut gen eris, irreducible to normal ways of feeling or thinking?a reality that must be studied in itself and for itself. Here is an attitude similar to the one taken by M. Levy-Bruhl with regard to primitive mentality. Morbid consciousness is, in fact, characterized by certain paradoxes : motor, affec 25 3 vol., Alean, 1919. 26 Flammarion, 1923.</page><page sequence="19">448 THE MONIST tive, logic paradoxes. The last mentioned of these is partic ularly interesting; the patient's thought swarms with con tradictions, irrepressible and inexpressible concepts queerly linked with a word taken from the current language but given an entirely different meaning. Such a consciousness, says Blondel, is not a normal con sciousness distorted. It is a unique consciousness dif ferent from ours and therefore incapable of conceptualiza tion and of socialization. It is due, according to Blondel, more particularly to the patient's richness in somatic sen sations and feelings. With the normal being, these sensa tions, being inexpressible, are "decanted" through the socialization of thought, for thought maintains and ex presses only what is common to all. With the patient the elements being more abundant and different from ours, cannot be "decanted." Hence his non-socialized and con sequently strange consciousness is an inexpressible con sciousness, ill adapted to ordinary speech. Hence the con tradictions. For to the patient words have a different meaning. He feels differently and experiences a resist ance due to common language and common consciousness. This conception of the purely psychological, placed in opposition to the social, offers some analogy with certain conceptions of psychoanalysis. "Decanted" realities are not without similarity to suppressed realities. The split between the psychological and the social reminds one of the opposition which Bleuler thinks characteristic of the schizophrenic between autistic and socialized thinking. Nevertheless, exemplifying a not uncommon paradox in the history of ideas, Blondel is a merciless enemy of psy choanalysis. His book on the subject is a biting and harsh criticism of Freudian theories.27 Here a few words would be in place concerning the influence of psychoanalysis on 27 La psychanalyse.

The novel tendency during that period has been an in creasing interest in psychoanalysis on the part of French speaking psychologists. If religious psychology were to have a place within the limits of this paper, it would be necessary to mention first of all Th. Flournoy, the genial and fruitful psychologist of Geneva, whose works previous to 1914 were an anticipation of the useful results of psycho analysis. In a paper on Une mystique moderne, published in 1915, he made a remarkable and very searching appli cation of the Freudian methods.28 Flournoy's influence has been and remains great in French Switzerland, and all French Swiss psychoanalysts are his disciples. To state things briefly and without reference to the his torical evolution of the doctrine, it might be said that among French-speaking psychologists we may distinguish three attitudes toward psychoanalysis. Some are openly hostile. Without referring to the authors, unfortunately still numerous, who criticize it with out being well informed, we may say that the most intelli gent criticisms have been made by Blondel (loe. cit.), Chaslin29 and Ombredanne.30 Others, without of course accepting all of the Freudian ideas, are strong advocates of the psychoanalytic methods. Several among this num ber have made valuable contributions to the subject. We would mention in France, the works of Hesnard, Laforgue, d'Allendy, Borel, Robin, Minkowski ; in Switzerland, works by H. Flournoy, R. de Saussure (among whose publica tions there is an excellent book on the general doctrine of psychoanalysis31), Odier, Christin, Baudouin; in Belgium, the contributions of Varendonck.

Payot, 1922.</page><page sequence="21">450 THE MONIST augurated a yearbook of psychoanalysis, an interesting volume of which has already been published. It contains a complete bibliography of psychoanalytical works written in French during the last few years.32 Finally, a third group assumes an attitude of sympathy and critical re serve, and tries to point out what of the material presented by psychoanalysts is fruitful and what must be ascribed to the spirit of systematization. In Switzerland, Clapa rede, Bovet and Larguier des Bancels have published sev eral studies replete with suggestions. In France, Dumas has devoted some very interesting pages of his Trait? to Freud ianism, and put in a particularly clear light the psychiatric usefulness of the concept of suppression. In a similar spirit, H. Claude, with his students at Sainte Anne, is mak ing a number of different investigations of schizophrenia. A propos of psychoanalysis we would mention an inter esting book by Varendonck, Evolution des facult?s con scientes.3* This represents a psychology of intelligence stu died from a dynamic and affective point of view inspired by Freudianism. But with such a rapid review of the work of Janet, of Blondel and of those inspired by psychoanalysis we have not exhausted the studies of French-speaking authors in the field of abnormal psychology. To be mentioned also are the books of Logre and Devaux on Les anxieux** and of Dupr? on La pathologie de l'?motivit? et de l'imagina tion an already mentioned book by Delmas and Boll, and the work of M. de Fleury on Les ?tats d?pressifs et la neu rasth?nie the studies of Hartenberg on Les psychonev roses anxieuses; works by Laignel-Lavastine, Revault d'Allonnes, Mourgue, etc., etc. 32 L'?volution psychiatrique.

Pieron and E. Rabaud. But even though Pieron's works may at any time delve into general or abnormal psychol ogy, they nevertheless stand by themselves, because the strictly physiological and experimental methods of their author have obliged him to cling to special problems. We mention first a general work by Pieron on Le cer veau et la pens?e37 It is a well-informed, clear, and up-to date review of psycho-physiological problems, particularly of questions of cerebral localization which have been so deeply changed by observations on wounded soldiers dur ing the war. This book contains also a complete study of the physiological problem of aphasia and severaljiew feat ures such as an interesting physiological schema similar to that of Claparede. Pieron has also published in the Ann?e psychologique (which he directs since Binet's death), in the Journal de Psychologie, and in various French biological Bulletins a great number of papers and notes on psycho-physiological questions. Three of these studies must be mentioned. First, an Essai d'analyse ex perimentale du temps de latence sensorielle39. In this study Pieron takes as a working hypotheses the idea that "the decrease in the time of releasing peripherally a sensorial nervous influx through a physical stimulus of increasing intensity must, since it is capable of determining to a great extent the general aspect of the phenomenon, result in decreasing the reaction time considered in relation to the increasing intensity of excitation." Then in a paper pub lished in 192239 on new researches in the analysis of the time of sensorial latency Pieron succeeds in confirming this 37 Alean, 1923. 38 Journ. de Psycho!., 1920. 39 Ann?e Psychol., Vol. XX.</page><page sequence="23">452 THE MONIST hypothesis and discovers a general law relating to the de crease of reaction time. Turning to the second of the studies above referred to we would call attention to a short but important note : Du role des reflexes localisateurs dans les perception spatiales*0 in which Pieron supports the in teresting idea of nativism in respect to reflexes. Nativist theories, according to Pieron, must be rejected as regards the associative level of knowledge, since the associative reactions of spatial perception, for instance, are acquired only by an empirical process of trial and error. But cer tain congenital reactions of localization show that localiza tion is also made through a "prise de connaissance" of spa tial reflexes, and this allows the partial reintroduction of nativistic theories under a new form. The third of Pieron's studies alluded to above is presented in an important paper entitled Les probl?mes psychologiques de la perception du temps.41 Here Pieron expresses a great number of useful suggestions concerning the difficult question at issue. Atten tion should be called also to another research by Pieron on the memory of digits and forms,42 and to works by Madame Pieron on various tests of aptitude, on sensorial transfer, etc. In this same field M. Foucault and B. Bourdon have made valuable contributions, the former on sensations and perceptions, the latter on exercise, fatigue, rest, persist ency of acquired habits, etc. The question of psychological heredity has been excellently treated by Poyer.43 M. Wallon has contributed an interesting study on motor reactions in emotions.44 His two chapters in Dumas' Trait? on the biological conditions of consciousness and on the subconscious life are full of useful ideas. His book on L'Enfant turbulent contains also much in the nature of 40 Journ. de Psychol, 1921. 41 Ann?e psychol, XXIV. 42 Ibid., XXII. 43Alcan, 1921. 44 Ann?e psychol., XXII.</page><page sequence="24">PSYCHOLOGY 453 physiological psychology. Lastly, mention must be made of a forceful study by Wintrebert in Le mouvement sans nerfs.45 To physiological psychology belongs animal psychology. Pieron, who himself made a great number of researches in this field (particularly on memory curves of mollusks) has given a good summary of it in Dumas' Trait?. Moreover, E. Rabaud has made several interesting contributions to this subject as well as to pure biology. Rabaud's orientation is towards integral mechanism. No one more than he attacks anthropomorphism, finalism, vitalism under any form. No one is a more enthusiastic believer in the con tinuity between the purely physiological and the intellec tual, through the steps of reflex and instinct. His work on instinct tends to show that instinct is far from being infallible and immutable, as too many seem to think. In stinct is but a collection of reflexes that work mechanically, right or wrong according to circumstances.46 On the other hand, the reflex or instinctive mechanism is not merely dependent on external stimuli but is influenced by other factors such as internal secretions. From this point of view Rabaud studied the maternal affection of mice. Giard had explained this instinct through the advantage and well being which the mother derives from it. Rabaud, after criticizing this theory in detail, shows that a female is at tracted by the young of another female when she reaches the middle period of her pregnancy. This attraction ac cording to Rabaud depends on internal secretions of the ovary itself.47 45 Journ. de psychol., 1921. *? Journ. de psychol, 1921. See also Bull Bxol, 1918 and 1919, where Rabaud shows that a certain caterpillar lives underground simply because it flees from light. The so-called simulation of death belongs to the category of immobilization reflexes, the mechanism of which has been studied by Rabaud. 47 In the field of animal psychology mention must be made of the fine researches of Ferton on the life of bees and wasps. These correct many a hasty judgment due to Fabre. We refer also to A. Forel's work, Le monde social des fourmis (1921), a very important summary of a life-long observa tion of the customs of ants.</page><page sequence="25">454 the monist We thus come to the most striking novelty in the field of physiological psychology during these last years: en docrinology. The researches of Gley, Mayer, Laignel Lavastine, Claude, and Athias have indicated the great number of relations between internal secretions and re flexes, instinct, character, emotions, etc. Dumas gives a good general account of the question in the second volume of his Trait?. Problems Related to Psychology It would be difficult to close this rapid review of psycho logical works written in French without indicating the im plicit or explicit psychology found in the works of impor tant authors on logic and epistemology. In the field of logic we must speak of the Trait? de Logique by Goblot.48 It contains a theory of reasoning that is of interest to the psychologist. The syllogism, ac cording to Goblot, represents only a part of deductive rea soning. Deduction consists essentially of a mental con struction, similar to what Mach and Rignano call a "men tal experiment." Thus, mathematical reasoning consists of spatial or numerical constructions, the rules of which are not rules of logic but the propositions previously ac cepted. The part played by the syllogism is only to permit the application of these rules to new constructions which are therefore the essence of reasoning. This theory is psy chologically very interesting and converges with the teach ings of the German Denkpsychologie. In epistemology, the names of Brunschvicg and Meyer son must be mentioned. In Vexperience humaine et la causalit? physique by the former, is to be found a genetic psychology of the notions of cause and of object. As we have elsewhere endeavored to show,50 it mav be compared ?Colin, 1918. ?Alean, 1922. 50 Journ. de psychol, XXI.</page><page sequence="26">PSYCHOLOGY 455 with Baldwin's system of genetic logic. Although M. Brunschvicg is a pure epistemologist, the reading of his pages is indispensable to anyone who would again take up Ribot's researches on the evolution of general ideas. It is much the same with M. E. Meyerson's works, De Vexpli cation dans les sciences and la deduction relativiste. Mey erson's central idea is that the notion of cause belongs with that of logical identification and may thus be con trasted with the notion of law. Such a theory presupposes a psychology of perception, as indeed is explicitly stated by Meyerson himself : to perceive is to identify. But while Brunschvicg believes in the plasticity of reason, in genetic transformations of the categories, theories which open the door for ? genetic psychology,51 M. Meyerson is a "fixist" and thinks that always and everywhere, with animal or primitive man, with children or civilized people, perception is a rational process and reason is invariable, both being essentially an identification of diverse elements. Bergson has published only two new books since 1914, L' nergie spirituelle, a collection of previously published studies, and Dur e et simultan it in which he is led by Einstein's physical theories to reconsider his conception of time. Among other epistemological works touching psychol ogy we would call attention to a fine book by J. Paliard, Intuition and reflexion, which presents some highly inter esting ideas on the relations of life and consciousness. Worthy of mention is, finally, the attempt of P. Masson Oursel (La philosophie compar e) to find some parallelism between European philosophy and Chinese and Hindu thought. A chapter devoted to a comparison of psycholo gies gives valuable information for history of psychology. JEAN PIAGET. NEUCHATEL, SWITZERLAND. 51 Brunschvicg in this respect agrees with A. Lalande whose fine method ological preface to Dumas* Trait must be mentioned.</page></plain_text>
