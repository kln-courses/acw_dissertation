<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Argument of Design Today Louis Dupre The argument of design is not a single, homogeneous structure. Kant, who was familiar only with a modern version, referred to it as the oldest proof for the existence of God. Old it is indeed, even though we do not have evidence of its use as a "proof" until Philo. Although Aristotle was the one who developed the very concept of teleology on which all later arguments would be based, he himself used the argument in none of his extant works: the process of adaptation is a work of nature rather than of God.' Even to the Stoics the idea of an ordered cosmos ruled by a divine Providence was more a theological conclusion than a philo- sophical premise. Instead of "proving" the presence of a divine Logos in the world, they rather attempted to justify this assumed presence in the face of objections of disorder. Today we would not term such an attempt natural theology but theodicy. Philo, from all appearances, based his argument on Aristotle's lost dialogue.2 The argument as he uses it places most of the emphasis on the harmony in the universe. Later Aristotle's teleological considerations also would be developed into a full-fledged argument. Occasionally the two would run parallel, at other times they would merge. Since this article does not intend to be historical, I omit here the complex development of the two forms and merely take an example of each from Aquinas who gave both their I 1 Two rare instances where God is declared to be responsible for the adaptation are De Coelo 27xa 33 and De Generatione et Corruptione 336b 32. W. D. Ross interprets these passages as "a literary device and a concession to ordinary ways of thinking" in- compatible with Aristotle's nonintervention theology. See W. D. Ross, Aristotle (Boston: Meridian Books, 1959), pp. 8i, 176. Yet in Aristotle's lost early work, On Philosophy, he clearly introduced the teleological argument.

However, since I intend to deal primarily with the contemporary discussion, I shall not restrict myself to that early expression or concern myself with its historical circumstances. First I shall consider the proof based on the existence of ends, then the one based on the order in the universe. I. THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT In the Summa theologiae Thomas writes: "We see that things which lack knowledge, such as natural bodies act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that they achieve their end, not fortuitously, but designedly. Now whatever lacks knowledge cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is directed by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end: and this being we call God." 3 Two things are affirmed here. One, the constancy of relations and the general direction indicate the presence of a teleological directedness in nature. Two, such a directedness must be the work of a mind. Obviously the term end is to be understood here as the purpose which motivates the develop- ment, not as the actual outcome of a process. Yet the difficulty consists in detecting the presence of a purpose when we only have direct access to the outcome. It is clearly not justified to conclude to the former merely because we find some meaning in the latter. For as every con- ceivable state of affairs, even one resulting from the merest fortuitous coincidence, may be interpreted as a meaningful outcome, one could attribute purpose to every process. Nor do repetition and regularity necessarily indicate the presence of purpose, since a particular system may perpetuate itself if the factor which disturbs it entails an element that will restore the original state. Predictability, then, is no indication of teleological directedness. Neither is the mere fact that certain events condition the occurrence of other events. The ecological cycle of nature appears to be a marvelously coherent system. But must we regard it as a teleological process ? Not necessarily, for the outcome in this case may not be more than the balance finally attained among conflicting elements. Moreover, which state would be the "end" of the system ? 2 3 S. T. I, 2, 3. Translated as Basic Writings of St. Thomas, ed. Anton Pegis (New York: Random House, 1945)-</page><page sequence="3">The Argument of Design Today Can we ever conclude from the nature of the outcome and the development of the process to the presence of a purpose? Rigorist interpreters would claim that only acts of beings that are capable of belief and desire may safely be termed purposive.4 If correct, this con- clusion would deprive the argument of all its power, since the existence of such a being is precisely what must be proven. Others, such as C. A. Mace, have been more optimistic about the possibility of detecting teleological characteristics in the process itself.5 Yet then the second question emerges: Must such a process necessarily be the work of a mind ? Mace believes that it is at least highly probable that a teleological process defined in his terms occurs only where a mind is operative. In any event, the attribution of a teleological directedness to beings other than man and perhaps some higher animals cannot be fully verified. At best a teleological explanation of certain types of behavior may be empirically more satisfactory than a nonteleological.6 The advent of Darwin's theory has, of course, considerably con- tributed to the demise of teleological speculations. Yet in the final analysis, Darwinism neither adds to, nor subtracts from, the essence of the original teleological argument. Its strength and weakness fall en- tirely outside its scope. Nevertheless a frequent presentation of the argument from the seventeenth century onward is very much open to Darwin's attacks. For any adaptation of a particular animal to its environment or of an organ to a particular function may be the outcome of an elimination process rather than of a teleological development. This applies to William Paley's famous description of the functioning of the eye7 and to Hume's argument based on the complimentarity of male and female for generative purposes in anatomy, passion, and in- stinct. Those arguments lose their power once the adaption is no longer 4 C. J. Ducasse, "Explanation, Mechanism and Teleology," Journal of Philosophy 23 (1926). Reprinted in Readings in Philosophical Analysis, ed. H. Feigl and Wilfred Sellars (New York: Appleton Century, 1949), PP- 540-44. 5 C. A. Mace describes as teleological a process by which a negative condition is counteracted by a contrasting condition in such a way that all action which increases the degree of the latter tends to be continued or repeated, while any action which decreases that degree tends to be discontinued, and that, with repetition of the process, the process as a whole approximates to a set of component actions which performed in that order and only in that order are sufficient to produce the second condition (" Mechanical and Teleological Causation," Readings in Analytic Philosophy, pp. 535-36). 6 This is the line of reasoning taken by Charles Taylor, The Explanation of Behavior (New York: Humanities Press, 1964). ?William Paley, Natural Theology, ed. Frederick Ferr6 (Indianapolis: Bobbs- Merrill Co., 1963), pp. I3-19- 3</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion conceived as an instant fact but as the outcome of a long and often devious evolutionary process. Darwin clearly anticipated the catas- trophic impact which his theory would have on the traditional argu- ment. "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formally seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man."'8 The relation between the final outcome of an evolutionary process and the various stages leading to it is quite different from the one between end and means in the production of an artifact. Out of a number of mutations only these are preserved which enhance the individual's chances for survival in a particular environment. There is natural selection but no evidence of choice.9 Paradoxically Darwin and his followers continue to use teleological models of interpretation. The very term "natural selection," derived from cattle breeding, connotes a preexisting design as well as certain principles of economy in the execution of this design. Susanne Langer has rightly criticized this terminology. "So all the considerations of economy, time-saving, margins of safety, reserves of material, storage and deployment of power, and the principles of coordination and com- munication governing our industry are read into the organic forms and functions that have taken shape in the course of evolution."10 The problems are increased by the fact that selection strongly evokes the idea of an intelligent agent. Darwin and his successors no longer refer to God as the supreme planner but they ascribe to "Nature" or "Evo- lution" pretty much the same function. This is much more than a matter of linguistic accuracy, for the teleo- logical implications may lead us to anticipate developments which are not borne out by the facts. Thus on the basis of a teleological inter- pretation one would expect only those variations (mutations in Neo- Darwinism) to become permanent which contribute to the species' survival. But no evidence at all supports such a Leibnizian economy of 4 8 Autobiography (London: Collins, I958), p. 87. 9 Norman Kemp Smith comments on Darwin's text. " The hinge of a door affords conclusive proof of the existence of an artificer; the hinge of the bivalve shell, though incomparably superior as a hinge, affords no such proof: it is as natural in its origin as anything in physical nature can be known to be" (" Is Divine Existence Credible ?" in The Credibility of Divine Existence [New York: Saint Martin Press], p.

A number of mutations are retained which fulfill no func- tion whatever. The question clearly is not what "Nature" requires for its future perfection but what the present situation allows. This situation displays neither design nor perfection, except perhaps in the highly qualified sense which I shall discuss soon. Instead of a preexisting plan which tolerates no deviation, we only find undetermined impulses which are able or unable to assert themselves in a given environment. Such a view of evolution differs substantially from the common one which appears to be guided by what one critic has called "the myth of the maximum," according to which the promotion of the ultimate end must be maximized. That only those acts which will yield a higher production than their alternatives will be chosen, may be validly as- sumed in economy. But nothing in the evolutionary process justifies the assumption that the fitness standard will be maximized. What remains is "not the best, but only the better, the good enough, the temporary expedient." 11 The "economic" teleology holds no basis in fact but only in an anthropomorphic, teleological model. In a complex system of agents various forms of interplay lead to different results and only those results will be preserved which are not neutralized by opposite components. Thus, compared to its antecedents, the outcome "makes sense" and our tendency to give it a teleological interpretation becomes understandable enough. Yet the evolution theory has not necessarily eliminated the possibility of a teleological worldview. For as long as no purposive intervention is required for any particular adaptation the argument still stands. As Anthony Kenny remarks "The argument was only that the ultimate explanation of such adaptation must be found in intelligence; and if the argument was correct, then any Darwinian success merely inserts an extra step between the phenomena to be explained and their ultimate explanation." 12 Indeed, far from diminishing the possibility of a teleological world order, one might claim with Anthony Flew that the evolution theory has brought just so much more grist to the mill of the teleologist.'3 In the new context the object of teleological speculation will be the con- sistent, one-dimensional trend of a development which, for all we know, is not the only possible one: an evolution toward ever greater complexity 5 11 William C. Wimsatt, "The Machine in the Ghost" (paper read at the annual meeting of the American Metaphysical Society, Washington, D.C., 1972). 12 Anthony Kenny, The Five Ways (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1969). 13 God and Philosophy (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1966), p. 6o.</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion and deeper inwardness ultimately resulting in the improbable event of life. The development has continued to move toward the most complex forms of life and from all appearances it still has not completed its course. Why, out of an infinite number of possibilities, were just the conditions of life fulfilled, and fulfilled almost at once ? 14 Their ful- fillment cannot be explained by a biological struggle for survival.15 Everything seems to have been "arranged" toward the development of consciousness, although an almost infinite number of complex factors were needed for this involution. Individually all these steps can be explained without invoking teleology. But considering the steady de- velopment of the process toward greater complexity, the observer inevitably receives the impression that the evolution moves toward a specific goal. Still, no empirical evidence can ever establish more than a more or less steady development in one direction. Whether this directedness be interpreted in a teleological sense or not, depends on the philosophical inclinations of the observer, but it can never be con- sidered a strictly scientific conclusion. From the same facts and even theories which led Teilhard de Chardin and Lecomte du Nouy to a teleological interpretation, Monod and Rostand conclude, to a purely deterministic, nonteleological one. Even if a compelling case could be made for the teleological view, the existence of a perfect designer would not necessarily follow. For to warrant such a conclusion the evolutionary process would have to appear evidently good. But who could claim this for a development in which individuals and entire species are sacrificed? The end result is the outcome of a long and cruel struggle which left most of the partici- pants dead by the roadside. From the victims' point of view at least there would be little perfection in the alleged ends-means relation of the present arrangement. That man, who came as the winner out of this contest, considers himself the goal of the development and imposes his own purposes upon all of organic and inorganic nature, is under- 6 14 The appearance of a single molecule of dissymetry such as those of living organ- isms is difficult to explain by chance. The appearance of hundreds of millions of them becomes almost impossible. 15 F. R. Tennant made the point well: " Of a struggle for existence between rival worlds, out of which ours has survived as the fittest, we have no knowledge upon which to draw. Natural selection cannot here be invoked; and if the term 'evolution' be applicable at all to the whole world-process, it must have a different meaning from that which it bears in Darwinian biology. Presumably the world is comparable with a single throw of dice. And common sense is not foolish in suspecting the dice to have been loaded" (Philosophical Theology, 2 vols. [London: Cambridge University Press, 1935], 2:87).</page><page sequence="7">The Argument of Design Today standable enough. In one sense such a view is also correct, for only a person can conceive of himself as a purpose and once he has started doing so is no longer able to see himself as subordinate to any other part of nature. But does the ultimacy of man's position indicate the existence of a perfect design? Could mind itself not be an abortive attempt, a terminus of the evolutionary drive, that is doomed to ex- tinction? Behavioral scientists wonder more and more whether man will be able to survive his built-in problems.16 Not only psychologists but also biologists (e.g., Paul Maclean) begin to question how man can continue to live with the schizoid nature that is his. Without considering these pessimistic forecasts, we may still wonder whether the record of his actual achievements, past and present, justifies the assumption of a vast and complex creation by an all-wise God. The unprejudiced mind finds it difficult to detect a divine purpose in man's accomplishments. Even Hegel, so incorrigibly optimistic in his philosophy of history, wrote at the end of his life "We see the earth covered with ruins, with remains of the splendid edifices and works left by the finest nations whose ends we recognize as having a substantial value. Great national objects and human works do indeed endure and defy time, but all that splendid national life has irrecoverably perished. We thus see how, on the one hand, petty, subordinate, even despicable designs are fulfilled; and, on the other hand, how those which are recognized as having substantial value are frustrated." 17 Yet, one might object with Kant, even if man would never accomplish anything else, he could still be the moral purpose of the universe. In his Critique of Judgment Kant claims that the universe finds its ultimate purpose not in man's cognitive or technical needs or in his pleasure, but in his moral will which alone is an unconditioned end.18 Only the moral will of man could give a Supreme Being a sufficient reason for creating a world. Kant is not disturbed by man's apparent wickedness, for morality, being purely internal, need not be an external success. Nevertheless Kant himself had to postulate an afterlife in order to give the will the holiness which it is unable to attain in this life and which 7 16 A popular expression of this doubt, which synthesizes a number of scientific conclusions, may be found in Arthur Koestler's The Ghost in the Machine (New York: Macmillan Co., 1967). 17 Vorlesungen iiber die Beweise vom Dasein Gottes (Berlin, 1966), p.

IIo.</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion alone makes man a worthy purpose of the universe. Thus teleological considerations determine the meaning of the ethical postulate of the existence of God. But they were never adequate to become an argument. In summary, I do not see how any teleological speculations could provide us with an "argument" for the existence of a perfect Designer. A person may draw his own conclusions from whatever private insights he has in this domain, but none of those can claim the universality of a compelling reason. II. THE ARGUMENT OF ORDER Let us now turn toward the concept of order. In the Summa contra gentiles Thomas writes: "In the world we find that things of diverse natures come together under one order, and this not rarely or by chance, but always or for the most part. There must therefore be some being by whose providence the world is governed." 19 The preceding concept of "end" is closely connected with the concept of "order" because a coordination of ends and means always presupposes some order among things. Yet order could conceivably exist without end-means relations. Moreover, when teleological relations do obtain within the universe, the universe itself cannot simply be conceived in terms of end and means. I even suspect that teleological considerations become meaning- less when applied to entire organisms within the universe. What could possibly be the "purpose" of a plant or an animal? To refer to them in such a manner is merely a crudely anthropomorphic way of saying that man uses them for his own benefit. At any rate, the term purpose does not apply to the universe as a whole, certainly not in the way in which end-means relations obtain within the world. Another reason for distinguishing order from teleology is that the former appears to escape the specific criticisms to which the latter is subject. There is no question here of the adaptation of individual means to individual ends, or even of an ultimate purpose of all processes. The basic observation here is that the impression of order is not re- stricted to the production of life from inorganic matter. Even in its static appearance the world seems to be an organized whole rather than a random collection of diverse and unrelated beings. The concept of order refers to any disposition of elements which allows 8 19 Summa contra gentiles, bk. I, chap. 13. Translation by Anton Pegis (Doubleday &amp; Co., 1966), p. 96.</page><page sequence="9">The Argument of Design Today the mind to recognize the totality of them as an intelligible, aesthetic, or moral unity. Man has always perceived the world as a cosmos, to which the structures of the mind can be applied. But what is the sig- nificance of this fact ? Does the coordination of physical phenomena and mental structures imply that the universe was "designed" by a mind similar to our own? Hardly. Structures are invented by the mind in accordance with its need to comprehend the universe as it in fact appears to us. Mathematical concepts apply to the world not because of a preestablished divine harmony between the mind and the world, but because that particular kind of symbolization was developed which proved most useful to understand the given world. Still, one might insist, the applicability of rational models presupposes the existence of a certain amount of coordination in the real world. This I fully con- cede, but, then, a universe without some degree of coordination would not only be unintelligible, it would also be impossible. If a universe exists at all, it must exist in some sort of order. Order is not an addition- al element, a distinctive ornament of one of the many possible worlds. It is the very condition of existence of a complex totality. We need no different justification for the order in the world than for the existence of the world. In whatever fashion the universe may have originated, a minimum of order had to be present instantly if it was to survive at all. The impossibility of absolute disorder, then, turns out to be the Achilles heel of the argument. For if order is a necessary condition of existence, its presence yields no indication of its origin. Note well, the dilemma here is not between order and pure chance, as the argument's advocates claim, but between an order imposed from without and one emerging from within. The argument gratuitously assumes that the only possible alternative to blind chance is a transcend- ent design. The arrangement of diverse things into an orderly pattern cannot result from their own divergent natures, Aquinas claims.20 But does the arrangement become more intelligible by assuming an orderly principle above the universe? Could rationality not have its source in the universe? If we accept a universe without beginning, as most Greeks did and as Aquinas himself considered to be irrefutably possible, could the arrangement not be inherent in the totality? To be sure, the order in the universe impresses us as if it had been designed, because in manufactured products order results from design. But for the order of the universe no trace of an actual designer can ever 9 20 Summa contra gentiles, bk. I, chap. 42.</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion be found and we may be tempted to agree with the skeptic in Wisdom's "Gods," that no gardener is responsible for the garden.21 What ulti- mately justifies this skepticism is the well-known difficulty involved in transferring what we know about the origin of an artifact to the origin of the universe. To counter Hume's objection of our inexperience with regard to the origins of worlds, it is insufficient to reply that a perfect analogy exists nowhere and that all reasoning goes beyond actual ex- perience. For the universe is unique in a different way: while all other things are part of it, here the whole, as such, is the very issue. I repeat, the problem is not whether the existence of order requires an explanation, but whether this explanation must come from within the universe. The principle of an immanent logos becomes absurd only if one previously assumes that the universe cannot be intrinsically rational or even divine by itself-as it was for the Greeks. But such an assumption already presupposes the acceptance of the very theism one wants to prove. However, granting the existence of a designed (i.e., transcendently imposed) order, does the order which actually obtains require a divine designer ? Certainly not if only a perfect order requires a perfect designer. Even if we are willing to assume that an imperfect order might have been designed by a perfect God, it is difficult to conceive how such an imperfect order could provide evidence of a perfect creator unless his existence was already known from other sources. What can we conclude about the nature of the designer on the basis of astral collisions in dis- tant galaxies, natural disasters on a life-bearing planet, the extinction of entire species for lack of a proper environment, the births of monsters and defective individuals, and, among conscious beings, the inestimable amounts of suffering and pain? To be sure, one may still assume that the present order is the best possible, as Leibniz did, but there clearly is no evidence that such must be the case. Indeed, the apparent absence of due order has become as much an objection against the acceptance of a perfect creator as the presence of order is an argument in its favor. The basic question, then, is: Is the imperfect order of the actual universe sufficient to prove the existence of a perfect designer? Could a Being of absolute wisdom and almighty power not have prevented some of the disorder? Or, as Bertrand Russell somewhat maliciously put it, do you think that, if you were granted omnipotence and omni- science and millions of years in which to perfect your world, you could IO 21 Logic and Language, ed.

But as long as we remain in the dark on those issues, the argument misses a basic premise. We are stranded with the dilemma of a world that is too good for not having been designed at all, and too bad for having obviously been designed by a wise, omnipotent God. Or, as William E. Hocking aptly expressed it: "From the standpoint of naturalism, the world is surprisingly good; from the standpoint of re- ligion, it is surprisingly bad; for naturalism, there is no problem of evil; there is no problem of good-and this problem is the substance of the teleological argument. But from the standpoint of religion, there is a problem of evil; and this problem is the burden of objection to the force of the proof." 23 III. CONCLUSION It may be appropriate to conclude this critique with a few remarks on its limitation. I have attempted to show that the argument of design independently of the religious experience is unable to prove the exis- tence of God. Is the man who sees the hand of God in the workings of this universe therefore subject to an illusion ? Such a conclusion does not follow from the preceding critique. What was an illusion is the "purely philosophical" status of the teleological argument. But the real thrust of teleological considerations in the religious vision does not lie in their probative power. If man is religious he cannot but see order as God's order, and he expresses this in a teleological theology. To him the order of the world, its beauty, its service to man, cease to be gratuitous. All these qualities, whatever their possible explanations may be, find their ultimate resting point in his faith. In this respect the attitude of faith differs substantially from that of philosophy which can make no assumptions that it is unable to justify by logical reflection upon experience. Usually the so-called arguments merely allow the believer to understand what he antecedently believed.24 In the words of Norman Kemp Smith: "In and through their religious experience of II 22 Why I Am Not a Christian (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1957), p. 1o. 23 Unpublished lectures, Manuscript VII, C-6-6. 24 Cf.

They do not observe order and design, and therefore infer a Designer: they argue that order and design must be present even when they are not apparent, because all existences other than God have their source in him." 25 The argument of design draws attention to a specific set of facts in which the religious mind confronts the transcendent.26 Order and dis- order force both believer and nonbeliever beyond the mere acceptance of empirical facts. To religious man, the detection of harmony and purpose becomes an occasion of faith and joy, just as the inability to explain disorder induces religious doubt. (The Psalms and the Book of Job are eloquent witnesses of both attitudes.) He feels that the non- believer is also puzzled by order and disorder, and he wants to com- municate his own world view. If he does this by attempting to educe the notion of Supreme Being from the idea of order, he merely commits a logical error. But often he is aware of the restrictions imposed by his particular universe of discourse. Even the much-criticized Paley did not think of himself as "proving" God to someone who had never heard of him, for he admitted that the recognition of divine purpose might require "some previous knowledge of the subject." 12 25 The Credibility of Divine Existence, p. 390.
