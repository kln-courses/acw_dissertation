<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH by Tamara Rombold In his The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights, John Steinbeck says that in growing up he "absorbed" the Bible through his skin.1 His knowledge and familiarity with the Bible shine through most of his novels, where he repeatedly uses Biblical imagery and symbolism. Steinbeck's use of the Bible is perhaps most uniform in his The Grapes of Wrath. Although numerous critics have already investigated this subject, they have failed to note the span of the Biblical allusions used throughout the novel, within whose structure Steinbeck has subtly inverted the entire scope of the Biblical mythos (i.e., the religiously authoritative legend of which the written Bible itself is the central component). Several critics have commented on Steinbeck's use of inversions of Biblical material?for example, the dead child set forth on the flood waters inverting the baby Moses story?but they have not seen the opening interchapter on the drought as an inversion of the Biblical creation story.2 Nor has anyone commented on the final scene, in which Rose of Sharon offers her breast to the dying man (618-19), as being filled with allusions to the new heavens and new earth described by Isaiah. These two structural anchors, coupled with the movement of allusions from those of the Old Testament to those of the New Testament, offer the possibility that the entire Biblical mythos may be inverted in the novel, from Creation through the journeys of the Old Testament to the figure of Jesus crucified and resurrected to, finally, the religiously expected new era when the judgment of the grapes of wrath is rendered.3 A key inversion of the Biblical narrative must be examined at the</page><page sequence="2">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 147 outset. In the Biblical narrative, God is an active participant on behalf of the people; in Steinbeck's narrative, however, God is conspicuously absent. This difference will be apparent again and again, but is most clearly stated explicitly by both Tom and Casy: "Prayer never brought in no side-meat. . . . An' Almighty God never raised no wages" (341). For Steinbeck, the people themselves are the agents of change and the parties responsible for action. A key theme in the novel is the rejection of traditional, organized religion in favor of a philosophy that asks, "Why do we got to hang it on God or Jesus? . . . maybe it's all men and women we love; maybe that's the Holy Sperit?-the human sperit" (32-33). The rejection of the agency of God and the rejection of traditional Christianity within a novel that clearly uses the very Bible of the organized religion it rejects can be troublesome. As Warren French writes, "it outrages all the psychological assumptions upon which such stories rely for their appeal."4 But this rejection of God clearly indicates how the novel uses an inversion of the Biblical mythos. Steinbeck's use of the interchapters, which generalize and deepen the significance of the Joads' experience within the novel, and his use of Biblical allusions which generalize and deepen the Joads' experience within the tradition of the mythos, place this novel within a very broad context.5 His elimination of God from that context in many ways knocks the reader off balance. But if the novel's own internal logic of repeated inversions of Biblical material and the theological implications of those inversions are kept in mind while reading The Grapes of Wrath, new insights into the social message of the novel can be gained. The Anti-Creation: The parallels between Creation in the King James Bible and Chapter I of The Grapes of Wrath are very close except that the processes are reversed.6 Genesis, of course, relates God's creation of the world in six days, remarking each day upon the goodness of the Creation. In contrast, Chapter I of The Grapes of Wrath relates the destruction of the Joads' world by drought. There are two time lines to Steinbeck's destruction story: the approximately six weeks from late May to mid-June (3-4), which contrast with the six days of the Biblical creation, and the three days explicitly listed (4-6), which cut the Biblical creation time in half. The slow Biblical cadence of Steinbeck's tale, with its incessant repetition of the gradual but thorough process of destruction,</page><page sequence="3">148 COLLEGE LITERATURE stands in stark contrast with the goodness of the description of God's creation. In at least one section of Steinbeck's chapter, the Biblical parallels are so exact as to deserve mention. By looking carefully at the chart below, comparing a selection from page 5 of The Grapes of Wrath with Genesis 1:13-18, we can see the similarities along with the inversion. This chart portrays the parallel of language juxtaposed to the contrast of process. In the Bible story, the days and nights are clearly demarcated, for the sun and moon have power to rule and to give adequate light (note the italicized passages). In Steinbeck's narrative, the sun no longer can give enough light to create day and the dusky day blends imperceptibly into night. For Steinbeck, the beating rays retain only the power to dry and destroy, not to lighten the day. Even the stars cannot pierce the dust to shed light. GENESIS 1:13-18 THE GRAPES OF WRATH, p. 5 1:13 And the evening and the The dawn came, but no day. morning were the third day. 1:14 And God said, Let there be In the gray sky a red sun appeared, lights dim, red circle that gave a little light, in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth', and it was so. 1:16 And God made two great lights; like dusk; and as the day advanced the greater light to rule the day, the dusk slipped back toward and the lesser light to rule the darkness night: he made the stars also. When the night came again it was black night for the stars could not pierce the dust to get down.</page><page sequence="4">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 149 1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night: and to divide the light from the darkness: And God saw that it was good and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn. In Genesis, God is the creating power and sees that it is good. In Steinbeck, the sun and wind are the destructive powers. In Genesis 1:2, the creative power of God is also called "the wind of God" or "r?ah 'el?h?m."7 So when Steinbeck writes "the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn," although he is writing about the actual wind, he is using Biblical language to directly invert the Genesis claim that "God saw that it was good." The passage analyzed in the chart is perhaps the most concise, clear, and direct inversion of the Biblical creation narrative but there are other inversions as well. For example, rather than the Biblical creation of the Seas separated from the dry land (Gen. 1:1-10), Steinbeck writes, "In the water-cut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams" (3). The dust fills in the place where the waters should have been on the dry land. And in Genesis 2:5-6, the Biblical author writes, "for the Lord God has not caused it to rain upon the earth . . . but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground." In contrast, for Steinbeck, in the absence of rain "an even blanket [of dust] covered the earth" (6). Thus the opening of The Grapes of Wrath can be seen as an inversion of the opening of the Bible. But this opening chapter of the novel also bears similarities to the plagues of Egypt, the stimulus for the Israelite forty-year sojourn in the wilderness, one of the great journey narratives underlying the Joad family's migration to California. Old Testament Journey Themes: Steinbeck incorporates imagery from three Old Testament journeys as background for the Joads' migration to California: Lot's flight from the sinful Sodom and Gomorrah, the Israelite's Exodus from Egypt, and the dispersion of the Jews after the destruction of Jerusalem in the Sixth Century B.C. Of these three, Exodus is the most significant for</page><page sequence="5">150 COLLEGE LITERATURE Steinbeck, informing his narrative from the plagues of Chapter I through to the Joad's entry into California. Just as in Egypt "there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not" the Israelites (Exod. 1:8), forcing them into slavery, the lending companies in Oklahoma began forcing the Joad family into greater and greater poverty until it is finally necessary for both the Joads and the Israelites to leave the land where once they had flourished. For the two peoples the process is similar except for one major difference: the Joads are evicted from the land, their homeland, in order to journey to a place of ultimate bondage while the Israelites are delivered by God from bondage in order ultimately to journey to their homeland.8 The Israelites have a dynamic leader in Moses, who leads them out of Egypt. There are some striking similarities between Tom Joad and Moses; for example, both approach a bush barefoot before beginning their missions. The significant difference between the two burning bush stories is that Moses approaches a burning bush from which emanates the voice of God (Exod. 3:1-5), while Tom approaches a willow tree in the midst of the burning drought-stricken land, and under that tree sits Jim Casy, who calls himself a former "burning busher" but is really just the figure of a man. Other critics' interpretation of Tom as a Moses-figure should not be taken too far, however, for Tom's leadership of the Joads is much less dynamic than Moses' leadership of the Israelites.9 Whereas Moses is the instigator of the Exodus from Egypt, Tom merely goes along with the family that has already made the decision and preparations to leave. Joseph Fontenrose has done an excellent job of showing the similarities between the plagues perpetrated against the Egyptians by God and the dust bowl that forces the sharecroppers off their land.10 The significant inversion of the plagues, though, is that in Exodus God spares the Israelites from every plague while in The Grapes of Wrath the ferocity of the drought is felt most fully by the people. The people in Exodus have God's promise that, seeing "the affliction of my people ... I am come down to deliver them out of the land of the Egyptians . . .unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey" (Exod. 3:7-8). In Steinbeck's narrative the people have no such promise. In fact, they have only the ultimately untrustworthy handbills from the landowners in California (124) to cling to for comfort on the journey. There are numerous parallels between the Israelite's Passover and the</page><page sequence="6">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 151 night the Joads prepare to leave Oklahoma. Both peoples prepare in haste, having splashed the blood of killed animals on the doorways of their homes (143, Exod. 12:7). The Israelite families each slaughter a lamb (Exod. 12:3); the Joads kill two pigs (143), a difference more significant than Fontenrose's assertion that pigs are more appropriate and convenient for Oklahomans than lamb.11 Since eating of pork would be expressly forbidden the Israelites during the Exodus journey (Deut. 14:8), the use of a pig in a Passover re-enactment is a dramatic inversion. Yet there are parallels, too. The Joads roast together all the bones of their animals (145) as the Israelites roasted their lamb whole (Exod. 12:9). Tom suggests that the family get ready in haste, by night (144) just as Moses hastens the eating of the Passover Meal (Exod. 12:3ff). The Joads eat their roast pork hurriedly, standing around the door (150) just as the Israelites were instructed?to eat their lamb with "loins girded, shoes on feet, and staff in hand; ... in haste" (Exod. 12:11). The Joads welcome Casy into their family for the trip (140) just as the Israelites are instructed to consider anyone who eats the Passover "as one born in the land" (Exod. 12:48-49). But the Joads take their leftovers with them for food on the trip (147), a precaution forbidden the Israelites (Exod. 12:39), who are, however, able to despoil the Egyptians of their jewels, gold, and silver (Exod. 12:35) before leaving, in contrast to the Joads who are cheated of all their goods and money by people remaining behind (132-133).12 Steinbeck includes imagery from two other Old Testament journeys to supplement the background for the Joads' journey: the imagery of Jeremiah and of Lot. As J. Paul Hunter notes, Muley Graves appears as an Old Testament prophet who first suggests the theme that "strength [for the people] can be achieved [only] through a selfless unity of the entire community of the Dispossessed."13 Muley's rough appearance and underground hiding from the authorities, along with his attachment to the land and lack of fear over the dangers inherent in staying behind, are reminiscent of the Prophet Jeremiah who, after being hunted and arrested by the king (Jer. 39:1-14, 40:1-6), also stays behind at Bethlehem (Jer. 42:2) as long as possible after the people of Judah (note the similarity with the name Joad) had fled to Egypt after the destruction of Jerusalem. Now this reversal of the Exodus from Egypt, the Jews' flight back to Egypt, is significant for an understanding of the Joads' journey to</page><page sequence="7">152 COLLEGE LITERATURE California not only because California will turn out to be the real "Egypt" or place of bondage for them, but also because of the significance of Jeremiah's prophesy which foretells the dangers awaiting those who make the journey: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, .... If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you; and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up ... . But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the Lord your God, Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell .... Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. (Jer. 42:9-16) Muley does not really encourage the Joads to stay behind, but by his actions and his awareness that the people must stick together to be strong, he eloquently offers an alternative to flight as a possibility. The words of Jeremiah are truly prophetic of the future that California holds for the Joads, but like the Judeans before them, the Joads do not listen to their prophet, but make the journey as they had planned. At the last moment, Grampa decides that he will not make the trip, but will stay behind with Muley (152). His decision is unacceptable to his family who therefore get him drunk in order to take him along (153). This action by the family is reminiscent of the action taken by the daughters of Lot, getting him drunk in a moment of crisis (Gen. 19:30-38). The similarities between Lot and Grampa are taken one step further when Tom selects a burial verse for Grampa from Genesis? "An' Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord" (Gen. 19:18)?which the family might have recognized as completely appropriate for Grampa had they read it in context. For this verse is Lot's response to the Angel sent by God to warn him to flee from the impending destruction of his town of residence, Sodom, "because the cry [of the city] is great, and because their sin is very grievous" (Gen. 18:20). The angel warns Lot to flee with his family to "Escape for thy life; look not behind thee . . . escape to the mountain" (Gen. 19:17). But Lot responds, "Oh, not so, my Lord ... I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die" (Gen. 19:19-20). And that of course is Grampa's response as well. Amidst the destruction of his hometown from drought and the evils of corporate</page><page sequence="8">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 153 farming forcing farmers from their land, Grampa chooses not to flee. When his decision is taken from him, he dies. And his wife is left to spend the rest of the journey "looking back" (238 for example) until she, like Lot's wife, also dies. But Grampa's family does not see this significance and so chooses the opening lines of Psalm 32 for his burial verse (182). "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered" seems an inappropriate selection to bury a man who took full zest out of life and could unremorsefully aim a shotgun at his grandson (102), but the selection shows the level of thinking on the issue of sin characterizing the Joads at this time. Their attitude toward sin is one of the areas of growth and change for the family on their journey. Both the Joads and the Israelites journeying to Canaan are warned of the dangers awaiting them among the riches of the new land. The Israelites send out spies to Canaan who verify the richness of the land, yet also warn that "the people be strong that dwell in the land" (Num. 13:28). The report of the spies strikes fear in the hearts of the people who decide not to venture into the land but to return to Egypt (Num. 14:2-3). God punishes them for their lack of faith by making them wander in the wilderness until the older generation dies (Num. 14:35). Likewise, the Joads twice meet returning migrants who verify the richness of California but warn against the hardships awaiting there (259, 281). Unlike the Israelites, the Joads decide both times to keep going on their journey. Despite their perseverance, the first generation of Joads, like that of the Israelites, perish along the way without ever seeing the new land. Finally, both peoples enter the new land: the Israelites by crossing the Jordan River (Joshua 4:1), the Joads, in a direct reversal, by crossing the Mohave desert (305). They enter California at a point exactly halfway through the novel. Like those that awaited the Israelites before them, troubles abound in the new land, which as Tom tells Casy, "ain't no Ian' of milk an' honey like the preachers say" (342). The Christ-Figures: The Biblical imagery shifts dramatically at this halfway point from the Old Testament to primarily New Testament imagery with the increas ingly prevalent allusions to the Christ-figures. Steinbeck presents both Jim Casy and Tom Joad as Christ-figures, although there is a qualitative difference between the two. As Dougherty has pointed out,</page><page sequence="9">154 COLLEGE LITERATURE with all the parallels between Jim Casy and Christ, Casy "does not reflect the divine nature of Christ" while Tom, with his beautiful good-bye speech to his mother, in which he paraphrases the risen Christ of Matthew, and his active ministry to the man blind in one eye, does exhibit more of the divine, majestic side of Christ.14 This difference, coupled with the unusualness of presenting two Christ-figures within one novel, implies the possibility that Steinbeck wanted to include in his novel the two traditional aspects of Christ, i.e., both the earthly and the resurrected Christ, without resorting to a miracle of resurrection. Steinbeck uses Christ-like imagery for both Casy and Tom as early as their first meeting. Tom comes across Casy sitting under a tree (25) in a manner similar to Jesus recognizing Nathaniel under the fig tree (John 1:48). Almost immediately Tom squats to draw his thoughts on the ground with a stick (28-30), again like Jesus in John 8:6. Now later in the novel, practically every character will draw in the dust, but the significance here is that Tom draws on the ground while listening to and absolving Casy's confession of sexual promiscuity just as in John 8:1-11, Jesus draws on the ground while listening to accusations of adultery being hurled at the woman standing before him, whom he also absolves. Finally, within this early meeting, Tom relates a story about being called "Jesus Meek" by the inmates of McAlester (35). Comic naming is a technique that Steinbeck would use again to indicate the presence of a Christ-figure15 and here in The Grapes of Wrath, within the context of the other Biblical allusions, the nickname serves to reinforce a Christ-like role for Tom. Within this first meeting, Casy also shows parallels with Christ. First of all, his name has the obvious initials "J. C."16 Of course, the last names of both Tom and Casy also give the initials "JC" when placed together, possibly confirming their joint Christ-figure roles. Casy has just returned from being "off alone" (which he will later describe to the Joads as being "in the hills . . . like Jesus went into the wilderness . . . ." (109)). While alone in the hills, Casy figures out a new theology which sounds remarkably like Jesus' teaching to "love one another" (John 13:34). "What's this call, this sperit? . . . It's love" (32). But Casy takes his teaching a step beyond Jesus by denying both the existence of God and of sin and virtue: "There ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue. There's just stuff people do. It's all part of the same thing" (31-32). But like Jesus, Casy teaches with authority (cf. Matt. 7:29, Mark 1:22, etc.). Like Jesus' teaching in the New</page><page sequence="10">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 155 Testament, Casy's teaching will supplant the older, traditional religion to become the basis for the Joad family's growing understanding of the need to look beyond the family and to take positive, cooperating, social action rather than relying on the traditional religious formula of sin and personal redemption. Later in the novel, after Tom and Casy leave Muley to go join the family, Steinbeck reinforces the Christ imagery one more time by describing Jim Casy as having a kind of nimbus on his forehead, "the light of the coming morning made his forehead seem to shine" (93), foreshadowing the use of another nimbus on Casy at his death (527). And Tom watches a snake wriggle "slowly from the cotton rows into the road," stops short of it and says, "Let it go" (93). For like Christ, Tom's "hour is not yet come" (John 2:4) but later, after the family reaches California, Tom will run over another snake on the road (314), taking upon himself the role attributed to Christ and described both in Genesis 3:15 and in the song which gives the novel its title, which says, "Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel."17 Both Tom and Casy fulfill the teaching role of Christ: Casy to both the Joad and Wilson families, united in a concrete step in the movement towards cooperation, and to the strikers; Tom to the gas station owner and the man blind in one eye at the junkyard, as well as later as he follows Casy, to Ma. Casy's teaching on the meaning of the passage from Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 recounted by Tom to Ma (570-571), that "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor," shows Casy's insight into an important Old Testament teaching on the essentiality of cooperative effort. His choice of Ecclesiastes is significant because the Preacher teaches other lessons in agreement with Casy: "that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour" (Eccles. 3:13), and that "the profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles. 5:9). In contrast to Brasch's assertion18 about the use of Ecclesiastes by Casy, for Casy to appropriate the teaching of an Old Testament figure serves to strengthen his role as a Christ-figure for Christ is also said to have appropriated and fulfilled the teachings of the Law and the Prophets (John 1:45). Jim Casy is perhaps most like Christ in the scenes of his arrest and death. He is arrested the first night the family spends in the new land, after they share a meal which exhibits almost no similarities to Jesus' last supper with his disciples, except that it is the occasion of Connie's Judas-like decision to abandon the family and its cause in order to go</page><page sequence="11">156 COLLEGE LITERATURE "back home an' get ... a three-dollar job" (343), i.e., $3, 30 dimes or 30 pieces of silver, the same fee Judas receives for turning in Jesus (Matt. 26:15).19 Casy is arrested after turning himself in to the police in order to spare Tom and another young man who have struck down a policeman who had provoked them (360-361). His heroic action, designed to spare two men who are guilty from the point of view of the law, is reminiscent of Christ's death scene. Jesus is traditionally seen as having died "for the remission of sins" (Matt. 26:28) and he actually dies on a cross between "two other malefactors" (Luke 23:32). The description of Casy as he is driven away also contains all the dignity attributed by the Bible to Christ at his arrest: "Between his guards Casy sat proudly, his head up and the stringy muscles of his neck prominent. On his lips there was a faint smile and on his face a curious look of conquest" (364). Just as the disciples flee after Christ's arrest (Mark 14:50), the Joads also are left in confusion and flee immediately, to a government camp. The opening scene the next morning in the camp is decidedly different in tone and atmosphere from the scenes in the Hooverville that precede it. In fact, it appears that the Joads have entered utopia when Tom is offered breakfast by the family in the next tent (394-398). James Hamby has done a beautiful job comparing this scene, as it appears in Steinbeck's short story, "Breakfast," to Psalms 23 and 121, concluding that the story "demonstrates a new testament to man's perfectibility" and that "Man's beginning, his hope and salvation are moved from a last supper [which does not appear in The Grapes of Wrath] to a first breakfast."20 And indeed, this story is filled with allusions to the "first breakfast" offered by Jesus to his disciples after his resurrection (John 21). Both stories occur early in the morning, within the setting of men going off to their work. Both concern unabashed and unlimited hospitality, for the generous catch of fish provided by Jesus (John 21:8) is not unlike the generous offer of work made to Tom (398). The time spent at Weedpatch camp is like a peaceful interlude between Casy's arrest and death for Casy is killed the day that the Joads leave Weedpatch. Like Jesus, Casy willingly sacrifices himself for his cause, but a key difference is that the gospels portray Christ as being somehow in command of events leading up to his arrest (for example, Luke 9:51 and 22:15) whereas Steinbeck presents Casy as ready for events but not as in control of them.</page><page sequence="12">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 157 The "cops" recognize Casy as "that shiny bastard" (527), a remark which can be understood as referring to a kind of nimbus around Casy.21 As one of the "cops" approaches Casy with a pick handle, Casy paraphrases, but significantly changes, Jesus' words on the cross. Casy tells his attacker, "You don' know what you're a-doin" (527), as Jesus tells the soldiers crucifying him, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:24). The significant difference is that, consistent with Casy's teaching, he makes no reference to God the Father nor to any need for forgiveness of sin for his attackers. At the point of death, Casy remains true to his beliefs. There is no hint of vengeance in Casy and he dies with the dignity and moral integrity expected of a Christ-figure. Tom acts like the apostles at his death scene. Like Peter, he strikes Casy's attacker (527; Luke 22:50) and hears the rooster crow in the morning (530; Luke 22:61). Like Peter, Tom is forced to "deny" Casy in order to assure his own safety, although Tom's denial is after the crow of the rooster and Peter's before.22 Like the apostle Paul, Tom experiences an "electric shock" (527: Acts 9) which results in a visual impairment which lasts until his decision to take up the ministry of his predecessor.23 Tom resumes his Christ-like role the next day when the family hides him during their escape from the Hooper ranch. Crockett24 has pointed out that the cave of mattresses in the back of the truck can be seen as a tomb. If that seems to be pressing the point, the cave in which Tom hides at the cotton plantation does bear a definite resemblance to the sepulchre in which Jesus' body was laid. Later, Ma goes to Tom's cave with food, just as the women go to Jesus' tomb early Sunday morning (Luke 24:1-10). Jesus' tomb is found empty, but Ma of course finds Tom. Like doubting Thomas before her (John 20:27-28), she touches her son's scars and rejoices in his closeness. And Tom explains to her the necessity of his following in Casy's footsteps. He reiterates Casy's basic gospel of group salvation through cooperative effort and paraphrases the words of both Jesus and Isaiah on the last judgment and of the risen Christ on his role in the world: I'll be ever'where?wherever you look. Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. If Casy knowed, why, I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're</page><page sequence="13">158 COLLEGE LITERATURE hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our folks eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build?why, I'll be there. (572) In this speech Tom claims for himself a role beyond that possible for any mortal. He claims the role of the risen Christ who said, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world" (Matt. 28:20). He also claims for himself the role of the blessed at the last judgment by paraphrasing Christ's description of that judgment: When the Son of man shall come in his glory ... he shall set the sheep on his right hand .... Then shall the King say unto them, . . . Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you .... For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; .... I was in prison, and ye came unto me ... . Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. (Matt. 25:31-40) And finally, Tom claims for himself a role in the coming "new heavens and new earth" by paraphrasing the prophet Isaiah: "And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them (Isa. 65:21). Thus Steinbeck portrays Tom with all the dignity and majesty inherent in the role of the risen Christ as Tom journeys forth from his tomb-like cave. Steinbeck includes two Christ-figures of equal significance within the novel and thus adapts significantly the Biblical mythos he uses as background. His two Christ-figures portray two different but equally important aspects of the Biblical Christ: the earthly Jesus involved in social ministry and the omnipresent risen Christ who somehow is "there" (Matt. 18:20) whenever humans take up the mission of Christ on earth. The Parable of the Grapes of Wrath: The significance of the title provides background for interpreting the final scene of this novel as depicting the judgment of the end-times and the arrival of the new heavens and the new earth. The title is taken from the first stanza of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic"?"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;/He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored." Browning and Lisca have noted that this hymn stanza alludes to the apocalyptic last judgment of Revelation 14:19, "And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God."25 But the title and the hymn also</page><page sequence="14">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 159 allude to a judgment passage in Isaiah appearing shortly before the one paraphrased by Tom in his farewell to his mother: I [God] have trodden the winepress alone: and of the people there was none with me: for I tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. (Isa. 63:3-4) Here in Isaiah, God promises both vengeance for the wrongdoers and redemption for the righteous. The Battle Hymn continues with even more allusions to God's final judgment and clearly indicates a background of final judgment for The Grapes of Wrath. But Steinbeck inverts the traditional religious expectation for that judgment for "it is the wrath of the people rather than of God which will effect the judgment"26 in the novel. The wrath of the people is ignited because they have lost the vineyard (i.e., their farms and access to the wealth of the California valley) that is by right theirs. In interchapters XIX, XXI, and XXV, Steinbeck uses imagery from Jesus' parable of the vineyard (Luke 20:9-16) in his description of the absentee ownership system in California. First, Steinbeck surprisingly accepts without condemnation the American theft of Mexican land in California (315). Seen in the context of his later assertion that the migrants also have the right to take the land from the large landowners (321), Steinbeck is, however, both internally consistent and consistent with Jesus' teaching in the parable of the vineyard: What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them [the "wicked husbandmen"]? He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. (Luke 20:15-16) The sins of the husbandmen in Jesus' parable and in Steinbeck's interchapters are the same: refusal to "give ... of the fruit of the vineyard" (Luke 20:10) to the rightful owners. Casy has taught the Joad family to reject the traditional religious view of personal sin, but that does not mean that Steinbeck in any way condones all human actions as merely "stuff people do" (32). Rather, he denounces as sinful the system and the people who let "the smell of rot fill the country" (477). For Steinbeck, this is the sin that will be tried in the final judgment. The New Heavens and the New Earth: The catastrophic flood that overtakes the cotton pickers ushers in the final judgment of this novel. In the Bible, God had made a covenant</page><page sequence="15">160 COLLEGE LITERATURE with Noah that never "shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth" (Gen. 9:11). But Steinbeck inverts this Biblical promise and describes his flood in terms almost as momentous as Noah's flood. Like Noah, the Joads go through most of the flood in an ark-like structure, the boxcar. But unlike Noah's family, their ark cannot save them from the waters (613). Perhaps it is significant that Noah, the eldest son of the Joad family, is not present in that boxcar or he might have been expected to play a role similar to that of his namesake in keeping the family safe.27 Steinbeck subverts the role of his Noah for, ironically, the Joads' Noah had earlier chosen the docile waters of the Colorado River (284) rather than staying with the family to await the flood. Thus in Steinbeck's use of the Biblical flood story, both literally and figuratively there is no Noah to spare the family from devastation. Steinbeck's flood is also described, in interchapter XXIX, in language using Biblical rhythms reminiscent of the anti-creation of Chapter I: The wind blew fiercely .... and it swished in the brush, and it roared in the forests .... For two days the earth drank the rain, until the earth was full. The puddles formed, and in the low places little lakes formed in the fields. The muddy lakes rose higher .... Level fields became lakes, broad and gray, and the rain whipped up the surfaces. Then the water poured over the highways .... The earth whispered under the beat of the rain; and the streams thundered under the churning freshets. (589-590) The Biblical rhythms, here combined with the repetition of the agency and anthropomorphism of the wind, along with the gradual but progressively advancing destruction described in terms of the number of days, are all reminiscent of Steinbeck's description of the destruction of the earth by drought in Chapter I. Thus this flood should be seen as a second destruction of the world within the novel. But this time, the flood waters recede and leave behind new life. Like the Biblical Noah, who knew that the flood was over when a dove returned to him with "an olive leaf pluckt off" in its mouth (Gen. 8:11), the migrants recognize the end of the destruction when "tiny points of grass came through the earth" (592). The world is not completely destroyed and life goes on with new meaning. The flood waters are also the burial place for Rose of Sharon's stillborn child. As Crockett has noted,28 by letting the stillborn child go upon the waters in its apple box, Uncle John inverts the story of the baby Moses let go in a basket upon the Nile. Moses is saved from the water (Exod. 2:3-10), while the Joad baby not only is dead to begin</page><page sequence="16">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 161 with, but actually tips over in the water (609). Uncle John powerfully strengthens the Moses story allusions within this scene by paraphrasing the words of "Go Down, Moses," a spiritual about Moses' role in freeing the Israelites from Egypt. He claims for the baby the role of Moses when he says: "Go down an' tell 'em. Go down in the street an' rot an' tell 'em that way .... (609). John the Baptist was no less eloquent than John Joad when he, too, stood beside the water calling for repentance.29 Steinbeck's interweaving of imagery from the Biblical flood, Moses, and John the Baptist serves to strengthen a theological expectation of the arrival of something significantly new. Ma and Rose of Sharon are the two characters who most fully image the coming of the new heavens and the new earth. Ma's final total assumption of power as the head of the family is both a harbinger of the new age and a transition into the feminine imagery of the last scenes of the book. Ma had been rebelling against Pa's authority (230, 478) throughout the novel but it is not until after Tom has left that Pa recognizes Ma as the head of the family, "Funny! Woman takin' over the fambly. Woman sayin' we'll do this here, an' we'll go there. An' I don' even care" (577). From this point on, Ma directs the family. Her role as leader and the decisions she makes resonate with the words of Jeremiah in his prophesy about the days of the symbolically significant restoration of Jerusalem: A voice heard in Ramah . . . Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; ... for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man .... In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth are set on edge. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel. (Jer. 31:15-31) This passage poetically describes a new age when the world will be turned upside down, when a new thing will appear on earth: when justice shall be done and each person will suffer only for his or her own sins, when mothers will not need to weep over their dead children and when authority will be given to those who have not held authority before. It describes the hope of the last scenes of the novel, in images directly relevant to the novel.</page><page sequence="17">162 COLLEGE LITERATURE Steinbeck departs from strictly Biblical imagery in portaying Rose of Sharon as an "earth mother" although vestiges of the symbolism of the earth mother can be found in the Bible, especially in its presentation of Mary, the mother of Jesus and in the book of the prophet Isaiah.30 Both of these Biblical presentations, as well as the significance of the earth mother symbolism itself, are important for our understanding of Rose of Sharon's role. In the first introduction of Rose of Sharon, "her whole thought and action were directed inward on the baby . . . the world was pregnant to her; she thought only in terms of reproduction and of motherhood" (130). All through the book, Rose of Sharon is shown as paramountly concerned with her pregnancy and the future of her baby. And right before she gives birth, Rose of Sharon does a symbolic, significant action when she walks out of the boxcar: the way Ma had gone earlier?into the willows. The wind blew more steadily now, and the bushes whished steadily. Rose of Sharon went down on her knees and crawled deep into the brush. The berry vines cut her face and pulled at her hair, but she didn't mind. Only when she felt the bushes touching her all over did she stop. She stretched out on her back. And she felt the weight of the baby inside her. (579-580) Here Rose of Sharon in effect becomes one with the earth, feeling the fruitful berry bushes surround her in the presence of Steinbeck's theologically significant wind. The painful scratches and hair pulling by the vines can also be seen as a kind of rite of initiation into oneness with those vines. The symbolism of the earth mother is also a strong context within which to understand the final scene. Steinbeck himself makes the connection when he writes of the scene, "The incident of the earth mother feeding by the breast is older than literature."31 Celeste Wright has convincingly described the ancient Greek and Roman analogues of the action as signifying adoption as when Hera suckled Heracles.32 Hunter has noted the similarities between the nursing scene in the barn and the birth scene of Jesus in the humble stable. Certainly, the final scene in which Rose of Sharon holds the starving man in her arms while giving him her breast (618-19) is painted in strokes reminiscent of innumerable paintings of the Madonna and Child. But unlike Mary, Rose of Sharon has not given birth to a Messiah, but rather to a stillborn Moses, the child of Rachel who was not. Nor is her "adopted child," the starving man in the barn, messianic. Rather he is symbolic</page><page sequence="18">BIBLICAL INVERSION IN THE GRAPES OF WRATH 163 of all oppressed people who need the actions of others to save them from starvation. Thus Rose of Sharon is an inverted figure of the Biblical Mary. But perhaps the more direct Biblical allusion for the novel's final scene comes from Isaiah 66, which describes so beautifully the fulfillment and peace of the new heavens and new earth in terms of the suckling of the people by God. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees. As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. (Isa. 66:10-13) As the Biblical scholar Carroll Stuhlmueller writes of this passage, All children of God nurse at the breast of Jerusalem?an image that beautifully portrays universal peace, contentment, and love. Imperceptibly the image changes and God takes the place of Jerusalem?fondling, comforting, and nursing his [sic] children.33 In the world of The Grapes of Wrath, Rose of Sharon takes the place of God at the Last Judgment as described by Isaiah, a last judgment which Steinbeck echoed earlier in Tom's good-bye speech to his mother (Isa. 65:20-22) and in the very title of the novel (Isa. 63:2-6). Isaiah's description of the judgment is one mixed with "indignation" towards God's "enemies" and love and comfort towards God's "children." By alluding to a Biblical passage that uses feminine imagery to describe the end-times, Steinbeck inverts the traditional Christian expectation that those times will involve the second coming of Christ. Steinbeck's use of this scene as the conclusion of his novel confirms Ma's assertion that the people go on and it brings to fruition the judgment of the grapes of wrath. By generously offering her breast to a stranger, Rose of Sharon heralds in the "new earth" where the oppressed know and act upon the knowledge that "Two are better than one_" Conclusion: Steinbeck has framed his novel within the structure of the Biblical mythos, inverting the mythos by eliminating God. He has taken away</page><page sequence="19">164 COLLEGE LITERATURE the miracles and the eschatological elements and has placed all the responsibility and action in the hands of the men and women of his own day. He rejects the traditional Christian hope for a better world to come with its "ice cream an gol' plates when you're dead" (571) and instead portrays that world as being right here, right now. By inverting almost every Biblical incident he includes, Steinbeck uses traditional Biblical material and at the same time breaks out of the traditional interpretation of that material to look at new possibilities. By concluding his novel with a woman concretely sharing her very self with a stranger, Steinbeck synthesizes the vision of Isaiah, in which the new heavens and the new earth are seen as overturning the present realities, with the vision of Ecclesiastes in which cooperative effort is seen as the hope of the people.
