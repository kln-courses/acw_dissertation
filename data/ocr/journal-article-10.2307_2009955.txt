Berkeley, University of California Press, I97I, 604 pp., $i6.75; $5.95 paper. I THE postwar period has been an unusual era in the annals of polit- ical science. Numerous practitioners of the discipline have ven- tured into areas previously unexplored, formulating new concepts, constructing new conceptual frameworks and models, putting forth new hypotheses and theories previously unstated, borrowing and im- porting ideas and methodological tools from sister disciplines, and improving upon old and innovating new research techniques (particu- larly quantitative techniques)-all in the interest of pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge. It seems no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most creative, if not necessarily the most fruitful, episodes in the development of the discipline. For all of this, publication of Herbert Hyman's Political Socialization (i959) and Gabriel Almond's and Sidney Verba's Civic Culture (i963) must be regarded as impor- tant milestones. In a sense, their appearances marked the branching out of the study of comparative politics into a new "catchment area,"1 namely, the study of political socialization and political culture. To be sure, the area of intellectual concern explored by these two works can be traced back to Montesquieu, de Tocqueville, Weber, and-last but not least-to a whole generation of students of "national character." However, in terms of the analytical and operational distinctiveness and the focus and techniques of empirical research, they represent new departures. This is particularly true with respect to the work by Al- mond and Verba, which broke new ground and opened up a new di- mension of the scientific study of politics.2 The significance of Hyman's 1 J.

In the years since the books by Hyman and Almond and Verba first appeared, they have exerted profound influence on the direction and focus of research, as evidenced by the recent mushrooming of literature on political culture and socialization. So great has been their impact on the discipline that today the jargon and many of the con- cepts they coined or popularized have become household words among political scientists. They have even made their impact felt in the field of Chinese politics, which, until the appearance of Chalmers Johnson's3 and especially Franz Schurmann's works,4 had had a rightly deserved reputation of leading a life of splendid isolation within the larger academic community. Publication, in recent years, of a number of studies on Chinese political socialization and culture bears eloquent testimony to the influence of these pioneering studies. Of all the recent studies on Chinese political socialization and culture, Professor Richard H. Solomon's Mao's Revolution and the Chinese Political Culture is undoubtedly the most provocative and imaginative. Unlike Wilson5 and Ridly and colleagues,6 who on the whole confine themselves to subject matters of manageable proportions and do their best to interpret and analyze the data collected, Solomon takes on nothing short of the Chinese political culture and contemporary Chi- nese politics in their entirety. It is a tour de force, an ambitious attempt at psychocultural characterization of the Chinese political system, and a neo-Freudian psychoanalysis of the politics of "one-fourth of man- kind."

And unlike Lifton,8 who psychoanalyzes the politics of Chairman Mao, Solomon psychoanalyzes nothing less than the politics of a nation of 700 million and the Chairman's attempts to transform the political culture of that nation. Although Solomon considers the first half of his book a study of Chinese political culture, his conceptualization of political culture has little, if anything, in common with that of Almond and Verba. (This does not discredit Solomon, whose conceptualization of political cul- ture, although not operationalized, is far more imaginative and to the point than that of Almond and Verba.)9 According to Solomon, polit- ical culture consists of a wide range of "social attitudes, emotional con- cerns, and moral norms which influence political behavior" (p. 2). Guided by insights derived from psychoanalytical theory and writings on "culture and personality," Solomon attempts to estab- lish connections between: (i) modes of child-rearing practice in China and the modal personality configuration of the Chinese, and (2) the Chinese modal personality and Chinese political culture. Solomon observes that in Chinese culture the process of socialization is divided into two distinct stages: from birth to the teens and from the teens to early adulthood. During the first stage, the child experi- ences extreme oral indulgence, permissiveness, and light discipline, especially regarding toilet training. Unlike American parents who try to inculcate the cultural norm of self-reliance in their child at as early an age as possible, Chinese parents prolong indulging their child as late as possible. They not only take care of but anticipate the child's physical and other needs. However, the child suddenly encoun- ters a radically different, painful treatment when he reaches his teens. His father becomes stern, more controlling, and more distant. Through the threat of isolation, physical punishment, the use of shaming tech- niques, ceaseless exhortation of the Confucian filial virtue, and by not 8Robert J. Lifton, Revolutionary Immortcality: Mcao Tse-tung and the Chinese Cul- tural Revolution (New York i968). 9 Students of political culture have yet to come to some sort of consensus as to what constitutes the core of intellectual concerns and appropriate research procedure. This is reflected in a recent conference summarized in Dorothy Knapp and others, "Digest of the Conference on Political Culture and Comparative Communist Studies," Newsletter on Comparative Studies of Communism, v (May 1972), 2-I7.</page><page sequence="4">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 611 allowing the child to "talk back" to them, Chinese parents develop considerable anxiety in their child about disobeying instructions and, indeed, fear of direct contact with the stern father. Solomon theorizes that persons undergoing this kind of experience in childhood develop certain personality traits in adulthood: oral pas- sivity, ambivalence toward authority, fear of being rejected by author- ity. These traits constitute part of the modal personality configuration of the Chinese. Another outstanding feature of Chinese child-rearing practices is the parents' severe disapproval and swift punishment of the child's expres- sion of hostile and aggressive impulses toward themselves, his siblings, and his neighborhood peers. This socialization results in the forma- tion of other salient components of the modal personality configuration of the Chinese: ready submission to authority, inability to handle emo- tional release and lack of faith in their ability to do so, and fear and avoidance of competition and conflict. Solomon goes on to delineate what he considers to be the outstanding and enduring characteristics of the Chinese political culture. He finds that there exists a perfect or high degree of "fit" (or congruence) be- tween the Chinese modal personality configuration, molded largely by Chinese child-rearing practices on the one hand, and the Chinese po- litical culture on the other. He then invokes the Chinese modal per- sonality configuration to explain Chinese political culture and certain recurrent features of Chinese politics.'0 In Chinese political culture, Solomon observes, there exists a paradox- ical combination of the desire for a strong leader and a concomitant resentment against the demands of this powerful authority. He ac- counts for this paradox in terms of the process of socialization. The sudden, drastic transition from the permissiveness of infancy to the harsh discipline of the teens produces in a maturing son a "strong sense of ambivalence to authority." He is worried about approaching it too closely and resents its manipulativeness, aloofness, and harshness. As a result of his interaction with his father (that distant, harsh, anxiety- provoking, and uncontrollable authority figure in the family), the child learns a variety of strategies for dealing with authority: avoid- ance of contact, ready obedience when contact becomes unavoidable, and appeal to stronger third parties for intercession. Solomon also invokes the process of socialization during the teens 10 See also Solomon, "Mao's Effort to Reintegrate the Chinese Polity: Problems of Authority and Conflict," in A. Doak Barnett, ed., Chinese Communist Politics in Action (Seattle 1969), 271-364.</page><page sequence="5">612 WORLD POLITICS to explain other psychological predispositions and personality traits of the Chinese. The "taking in" of orders, the unquestioning sub- mission to and dependence upon that distant and unapproachable authority, the father, who makes decisions for him, takes care of him, rewards him for conforming to demands, and punishes him for disobey- ing-all of these reactions have profound bearings on Chinese political culture. The ways of dealing with authority that are learned by the child in his teens prepare him for his adult political role and socialize him to respond in certain ways to things political in his adulthood. Psychological predispositions and personality thus formed-i.e., passiv- ity and anxiety before authority, lethargy and lack of initiative, and panicky fear and shunning of responsibility--in turn constitute part of the style of Chinese political behavior. Another apparently paradoxical phenomenon in interpersonal re- lationships and the sharp contrast between cultural and political real- ity is observed by Solomon. Interpersonal relationships in China tend to be characterized by excessive politeness and mannerism (ii mao and ko chi) and avoidance of competition and conflict, but often erupt into uncontrollable emotional outrage and unrestrained violence when the politeness breaks down." In other words, the Chinese are incapable of "disciplined" and "controlled" conflict. Historically, the enduring Confucian tradition that elevates love of peace and interpersonal har- mony to supreme social values has sharply contrasted with the recur- rent reality of periods of tranquillity and social order that were shat- tered by episodes of uncompromising political conflict and unrestrained violence. Chinese history has been an alternating pattern of peace and conflict. Here again, Solomon finds the explanation for the paradoxes in the Confucian cultural tradition that allegedly denies any legitimacy to limited release of hostility and aggression whatsoever, and the parental disapproval and punishment of any such expression on the part of their children. As he matures, a Chinese learns not to express any sentiments of hostility against those in positions of authority, and to swallow his resentment. He also learns early that emotional expressiveness is dangerous. Having been denied the opportunity to learn how to handle emotion, he grows up without any well developed control over re- leased emotions and with no faith in his ability to handle emotion and to engage in controlled conflict. Consequently, he develops excessive fear and avoidance of conflict. Having been taught that "holding in" 11 Ruth Benedict has made more or less similar observations about the Japanese. See The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture (Boston I946).</page><page sequence="6">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 613 one's emotion is the only proper response to interpersonal dealings, he has a tendency to erupt into uncontrollable violence once the lid on the emotion is removed. Having learned not to express hostile and aggressive sentiments (ex- cept against subordinates), having no faith in his ability to handle his own emotional impulses, fearing confusion, yearning for interpersonal harmony and peace, and yet distrusting his peers, a Chinese naturally comes "to see the only hope of maintaining social order in the external controls of social organization, in which the individual will be 'boxed in' by the combined forces of group obligations and ties, and the au- thority of strong leaders" (p. I32). This sentiment, combined with am- bivalence toward authority and readiness to abandon one authority figure in favor of another, explains the alternation of periods of tran- quillity based on submission to strong and unchallenged authority with episodes of uncompromising political conflict and unrestrained vio- lence. II In the foregoing section I have summarized Solomon's attempts at con- ceptualizing and theorizing about the Chinese modal personality con- figuration and political culture, and about their causal links to Chinese child-rearing practices. Together, they constitute the first two parts of his mammoth volume. Parts three and four analyze and interpret the Maoist political revolution and Maoist political reconstruction from the perspective of the frame of reference and theoretical insights developed in the earlier parts. All in all, the volume is one of the most provocative pieces of scholarship on the politics and culture of China that has ap- peared in recent years. It is full of insightful observations, perceptive analyses, and subtle and brilliant interpretations. It sheds much light on Chinese personality traits and political culture, and clarifies, for me at least, many puzzling issues and enigmatic events in contemporary Chinese politics. Solomon's analysis, from a psychocultural perspective, of Mao's revolutionary strategies in pursuit of power before i949 is highly illuminating and full of convincing arguments. However, his chapters dealing with Mao's attempts to transform Chinese society and culture in his own image, and with Chinese politics since i949 in gen- eral, are not as convincing. This is especially true with respect to his interpretation of the Cultural Revolution, which has a quality of rush- ing to judgment. Whatever its long-run status in the community of Sinologists, it is certainly one of the most original and provocative, and therefore controversial, interpretative works on Chinese politics</page><page sequence="7">614 WORLD POLITICS and culture. It is likely to be a work that students of Chinese politics will have to reckon with whether or not they agree with one or another of its particular theses. Although Solomon's attempts at psychocultural characterization and interpretation of Chinese politics may be a novelty in political science (at least in terms of its thoroughness and the size of the society it covers), the approach itself is nothing new, at least to the cultural and psychological anthropologists. For what Solomon (and others, such as Lucian Pye and Nathan Leites)'2 calls the psychocultural approach is no different from what the anthropologists have long known as the approach of "culture and personality," or the so-called "national char- acter studies" associated with some of the most illustrious names in twentieth-century anthropology-e.g., Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, Geoffrey Gorer, Clyde Kluckhohn, Cora DuBois, Ralph Linton, Wes- ton La Barre, Erik Erikson, and Abram Kardiner. Although I greatly admire Solomon's herculean efforts at psycho- cultural characterization and analysis of the Chinese modal personality configuration, I must admit that I have serious reservations about the results. Personality and culture form phenomena too complex to be fitted into simplified characterizations. Inasmuch as attempts at psycho- cultural characterizations of the small, "primitive," "simple," "pre- or non-literate" societies have come under severe criticism in the last two decades,13 one must be skeptical about attempts at psychocultural char- acterization and psychoanalysis of so large and diverse a cultural area as China-even though one may at the same time be sympathetic and admiring. Underlying the writings on culture and personality is the premise that a given cultural configuration has its counterpart in the individuals of each society, and that a given culture tends to produce a "modal personality," or a "basic personality structure," or a "character struc- ture." The very concept of modal personality configuration assumes cultural homogeneity, an extremely unrealistic assumption even for small, "primitive," "simple," "pre- or non-literate" societies, and a much less realistic one for a civilization or cultural area like China. 12 Lucian W. Pye (fn. 7); Nathan Leites, "Psycho-Cultural Hypotheses About Polit- ical Acts," World Politics, i (October I948), I02-I9. Among the studies by political scientists that attempt to explain politics in terms of culture and personality, two readily come to mind: Edward C. Banfield, The Moral Basis of a Backward Society (Glencoe, Ill. I958), and Pye, Politics, Personality and Nation-Building (New Haven i962). 13 See, for example, Alfred R. Lindesmith and Anselm L. Strauss, "A Critique of Culture-Personality Writings," American Sociological Review, xv (October I950), 587- 6oo.</page><page sequence="8">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 615 Alex Inkeles, one of whose writings inspired Solomon to use the con- cept of modal personality, takes advocates of the tradition of culture- personality to task for failing to account adequately for differentiation within large national populations. As he puts it, the culture-personality approach "emphasizes the central tendency, the existence of which it presumes but does not prove, and neglects the range of variation within and around the average or typical. Once we begin to deal with dis- tributions, with variations and range, we must recognize that a second weakness of this approach is that its descriptive language, the technical terms on which it is based, does not easily permit the precise measure- ment and quantitative expression necessary to the study of a distribu- tive phenomenon."'14 Solomon is aware of the indefensibility of the assumption of homo- geneity; he concedes that "even in the small sample of Chinese inter- viewed for this study we see a rich variation in personality style which thoroughly eliminates any 'all alike' interpretation" (p. 5n.). He feels confident, however, that his data show that there is "a range of social attitudes and emotional concerns common to this group [his sample], and shared patterns of behavior used [by this group] in coping with interpersonal situations" (p. 5n.). He believes that he can best confront the objection by turning the questions around: "'All Chinese are dif- ferent.' Is there nothing which they have in common? Unless one be- lieves that all generalizations about human social life, or history, are invalid-which we do not-the question is in what respects are Chinese alike, and in what ways is their individuality expressed?" (pp. 22-23). In his view, the issue boils down to the empirical question of whether such a range of common attitudes, emotional concerns, and shared pat- terns of behavior exists. The picture that emerges from this study shows that with respect to attitudes and responses to authority, confusion, and conflict, the Chinese indeed have much in common and tend to behave in more or less similar ways. Solomon believes, therefore, that the as- sumption of homogeneity is sustained by empirical investigation. Solomon's findings seem to contradict those of a field investigation by the anthropologist Francis L. K. Hsu in a village in southwest China, which was far removed from the coast and treaty ports and had preserved much of the traditional cultural pattern at the time the in- vestigation was undertaken in the early 1940's. Hsu observes that a strong father-son identification and "big-family ideal" dominates the family 14 Alex Inkeles, "National Character and Modern Political Systems," in Francis L. K. Hsu, ed., Psychological Anthropology: Approaches to Culture and Personality (Home- wood, Ill. i96i), I84.</page><page sequence="9">616 WORLD POLITICS relations in the West Town and is partly responsible for a social system that "deprives the younger generation of any feeling of independence, while at the same time enables them to share whatever wealth or glory is due their immediate or remote ancestors' -a cultural pattern which Solomon also notices. Hsu, however, points out that although submis- sion to ancestral and parental authority is among the most important elements in the "basic personality type" of the community, this basic type applies to different status groups in different ways. "While the same father-son identification exists among the rich and the poor, the difference in their economic conditions has caused the young of the rich and the young of the poor to develop two different types of per- sonality; the former, a higher degree of dependency upon the old and upon the traditional authority, the latter, a high degree of independ- ency from the old and from traditional authority."1 While the rich and persons with higher status submit and adhere more readily to ancestral and parental authority, the sons of a poor family not only are little con- cerned about their remote ancestors but also have less incentive to com- pete for paternal approval. "The old men, being poor, have little material wealth to give them, whereas wealthy fathers can express their pleasure or displeasure in very material ways.""7 Furthermore, Solomon's unqualified statement, based on the ob- servations of unnamed observers, that Chinese parents "literally at- tempt to beat the aggressiveness out of their youngsters through physical punishment" (p. 79) does not square well with the impression one gets from reading another field investigation. Hsiao-tung Fei's China's Gentry contains life histories of six Chinese families collected by Yung-teh Chow. One of them, Captain Yang, is a gangster-gentry, and what follows is his neighbor's description of how the captain's father reared his son: "Yang Keng-ju was very austere to his children. If he detected any cowardice in them, he would either scold them severely or beat them. He encouraged them in, or even drove them into, various exploits. If he saw his son showing recklessness or courage, he would be greatly delighted. He admired anyone who could instill fear in others."18 During his boyhood, Captain Yang organized the boys of his village into a group and repeatedly led them in fights with the boys of other villages until the latter were defeated and submitted to his con- trol. "This event was told to Captain Yang's father. Yang Keng-ju praised him highly and encouraged him to be more combative."' This 15 Francis L. K. Hsu, Under the Ancestor's Shadow (New York i967), 8. 16 Ibid., IO. 17 Ibid., 9. 18 Hsiao-tung Fei, China's Gentry (Chicago I953), 248. 19 Ibid., 249.</page><page sequence="10">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 617 life story of Captain Yang does not "invalidate" Solomon's thesis, but it does suggest that Chinese child-rearing practices may not be as uniform as he believes. Solomon's thesis would stand even if it allowed for a few cases of deviation from "the central tendency" or "the average." A few individ- uals may be aggressive and not fear or avoid conflict where the majority in the same society are not aggressive and do fear conflict; a few may have no sense of ambivalence toward authority and may not easily sub- mit themselves to authority where the majority do. In other words, Solomon may be adhering unnecessarily to a rigid and inflexible posi- tion and thus make himself vulnerable to attack. However, the pro- cedures and methods whereby he arrives at his conclusions are an even more critical issue. Concerning his methodology, I would like to know a great deal about such matters as sampling, statistical distributions, regional dif- ferences, social classes, status groups, and so forth. I would also be in- terested in knowing the techniques whereby Solomon arrives at his characterizations of the Chinese personality type, and how he obtains his information about Chinese child-rearing practices. The sample, methods, techniques, and procedures used have much to do with ques- tions of selectivity and neglect of corroboration by other investigators; they are intricately related to and largely determine his conclusions. The sample from which Solomon generalizes consists of 9i Chinese refugees who fled to Taiwan and Hong Kong in the late i940's and 1950-60's. Of this sample, 6i per cent were from eight provinces in East and South China. Regional unrepresentativeness is not as serious as the sampling bias with respect to degree of education. All of the respond- ents were "functionally literate." There were only a few "pure peas- ants." One-third had gone to college or had received a military educa- tion above the high school level. This means that the sample excludes the majority of the population, the illiterate. Solomon admits the un- representativeness of his sample when he observes: "This group of re- spondents represents the social base of semiurbanized or urbanized, lit- erate, middle to upper income level Chinese from coastal provinces . . ." (p. i6). In spite of this defect, he feels confident there exists "a shared core of culture and personality common to those reared within a so- cial tradition like China's, which was stable for many generations" because "there is a high degree of 'fit' between Mao's notion of the lead- ership process needed to mobilize peasants into the ranks of the revolu- tion, and the social attitudes of our 'bourgeois' respondents" (p. I7). No one would, of course, blame Solomon for not being able to obtain a ran-</page><page sequence="11">618 WORLD POLITICS dom sample representative of a cross-section of a population of 700 milt lion, but few scholars would agree that it is valid to leap from such a highly biased and small sample to the entire population of China. I could accept his findings more readily if he had conceded that his is a study of the modal personality and political culture of the Chinese refugees whom he interviewed. On the basis of his sample Solomon could hardly establish what the average or typical Chinese is like-if he exists at all. "Sampling errors" aside, there are difficult problems of interpreta- tion. In his attempts to characterize the Chinese modal personality and political attitudes, Solomon goes beyond conventional analytical tech- niques (e.g., administering standardized questionnaires), combining them with in-depth interviews and TAT (Thematic Apperception Test). TAT may be useful for some purposes, but its utility as a scientific tool for studying personality and culture is highly dubious. Bert Kap- lan, "perhaps the most qualified psychologist to analyze the role of projective testing in psychological anthropology,"" expresses serious reservations on whether the projective test adequately samples a re- spondent's personality process: A single Rorschach, TAT, or both, even when augmented with life his- tory materials and extensive observation studies . . . must yield an incom- plete account of the person. To the extent that the anthropologist or psychologist believes that personality is encapsulated in the microcosm of the test protocol, he is undoubtedly in error and in particularly serious error because he isn't likely to be aware of it.... When the worker knows that his sample is seriously incomplete, as most psychologists do, but treats it as though it were not, he is equally in error. Characteristically, projective techniques yield very interesting but somewhat cryptic responses. These responses, whether they are Ror- schach responses or TAT stories, are difficult to interpret even under the best conditions. When a drastic cultural difference exists, which the interpreter because of his inadequate knowledge of the culture and lan- guage of the subject cannot take into account, the responses are often completely uninterpretable. Unfortunately, in this situation where the interpreter has had the choice of either admitting his helplessness or of going ahead and making the interpretation he would if the response had been given by someone in his own culture, the latter course has been followed. The result has been that modal personality pictures have often had little more meaning than fairy tales...." Although Kaplan agrees that projective tests, including TAT, have been correct in part of their descriptions, he suggests that "most if not 20 Hsu (fn. 14), 23I. 21 Bert Kaplan, "Cross-Cultural Use of Projective Techniques," ibid., 238-40.</page><page sequence="12">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 619 all modal personality studies utilizing projective techniques have most probably been arriving at incorrect descriptions of the people they are concerned with."22 TAT and life histories derived from in-depth interviews may be very useful in illustrating a hypothesis, but they cannot prove it. Through selective use of data, quoting those that support one's hypothesis and neglecting or excluding those that contradict, one can usually make the data "prove" almost any hypothesis. The first two parts of Solomon's volume are full of excerpts from his respondents' replies that either "substantiate" or are made to substantiate his theses. In page after page Solomon makes sweeping, unqualified statements and the only evi- dence cited in support of such statements is an excerpt from one respond- ent's answers to TAT cards or Solomon's questions. Although such excerpts are illustrative of Solomon's theses, they do not "validate" them, for they do not constitute "proof" according to the acceptable canons of scientific investigation. Very often Solomon treats responses to his TAT cards as though they were living attitudes, as though the Chinese (and not only those in his sample) were predisposed to reacting in a more or less automatic fash- ion in certain ways (implied by their TAT-induced fairy tales or re- sponses to questions put to them by the interviewer) if and when confronted with the situations portrayed. Worse still, he often theorizes solely on the basis of his respondents' (and quite often a single respond- ent's) replies to the question or TAT cards, rather than on the basis of field observations-the least one is entitled to expect of a modern social scientist. The result is that Solomon's statements often rest on very shaky evi- dence. For example, using the answers of a few respondents to one of his TAT cards, he says: "Competition among peers is seen [by the Chi- nese] to be as troublesome for social unity as differences of opinion, for the expectation is that rivalry will bring out bad feelings and lead to unrestrained conflict" (p. I31). It is difficult to reconcile such a state- ment with the intense competitiveness of the Chinese in business, edu- cation, or imperial civil service examinations. Nor is it easy to reconcile the statement with the field observation of Wilson, who makes an analytical distinction between sanctioned and nonsanctioned expres- sions of hostility.23 How else would one explain such phenomena as tsu-tou (inter-clan struggles), a frequently observed phenomenon in certain parts of China, especially South China? In addition, there is the question of the validity of the substantive 22 Ibid., 240. 23 Wilson (fn. 5), chap. 3.</page><page sequence="13">620 WORLD POLITICS theory itself. Like many writers who try to link personality and culture, Solomon posits causal connections between the experience of early child- hood and adult political culture and behavior because they coexist side by side, albeit separated in time, in the same cultural setting. Apart from the accuracy of his portrayal of Chinese child-rearing practices and his characterization of the Chinese modal personality configuration, the very validity of the presumed causal chains is by no means beyond legitimate doubt. For the procedure of proof is one of "proof by juxta- position," a post hoc procedure of reasoning.24 Such a procedure in- volves what the anthropologist Orlansky calls "anthropomorphism," the main characteristics of which include: (i) little direct study of infants or children to determine whether the reactions attributed to them actually occur; (2) an assumption that the reaction of infants or children to a given type of experience "must be" of a certain character without any effort to prove that such is the case; (3) a dualistic proce- dure which postulates psychic "processes and states" as forces or "first causes" that produce behavior, resulting in an untested attribu- tion of motives and reactions.25 The following example nicely illustrates the first two points. First, Solomon observes: "As a child approaches his teens . . . his relation to parental authority, which at the end of infancy had become stern and controlling, becomes more distant. His father increasingly cuts himself of from direct interaction with him, and the child experiences only the taking of orders, the unquestioning reliance on a more distant and unapproachable source of control" (p. 56). Then Solomon quotes a respondent's answer to "substantiate" the hypothesis. From this reasoning and evidence, Solomon jumps to the following observations: "Several important patterns in relations be- tween superior and subordinate which find clear manifestation in Chinese political behavior seem to have their roots in the harsh and dis- tant treatment a father accords his growing sons. First, the child learns there is a distinction between decision-making and action in his rela- tions with authority. The father passes judgments regardless of the child's will, yet the child must obey when informed of parental deci- sions. Authority becomes associated with thought and word; subordina- tion with the need to act or execute the will of others.... Second, the child's contacts with authority become laden with anxiety. . ." (p. 57). Solomon makes no effort to establish the fact that the father-son interac- tion indeed becomes increasingly stern, controlling, and distant. Nor 24Lindesmith and Strauss (fn. I3), 597. 25 H. Orlansky, "Infant Care and Personality," Psychological Bulletin, XL (I949), I-48, as recapitulated in Lindesmith and Strauss (fn. i3), 596, 598.</page><page sequence="14">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 621 does he make any attempt to "prove" that the kind of father-son inter- action in the latter's teens does result in this kind of adult political be- havior. The causal chain is assumed because the two conditions are found in the same culture. Methodologically, such a procedure of "proof by juxtaposition" is inadequate, and yet it permeates the whole study. One more example must suffice. Solomon postulates a causal relationship between parental inhibition and punishment of the child's aggressive expressions, and lack of aggressiveness on the part of the child when he grows up-two separate phenomena widely separated in time. Important as it is for explaining certain aspects of Chinese political behavior, the hypothesis has yet to be proved empirically. The findings of a few studies of the relationship between parental punishment and aggressiveness (or non- aggressiveness) on the part of their child are inconclusive at best and contradictory at worst. After reviewing existing psychological anal- yses, Bandura and Walters conclude that "generally speaking, punish- ment by an authority figure [i.e., father or mother] seems to inhibit direct aggression in the presence of the punitive agent, but to be associ- ated with high aggression toward other possible targets. However, it is obvious that no firm statements can be made concerning the relation- ship of punishment and aggression unless the agent of punishment, the recipient of aggression, and the nature of both the punitive and aggressive responses are taken into account."2 Central to Solomon's theory is the notion of tension between the indulgence of infancy and the subsequent harsh discipline of youth, and the assertion that the transition from one to the other is sudden, drastic, and painful. According to him, the tension, the sharp contrast, and the drastic transition explain much of Chinese political culture e.g., the Chinese ambivalence toward authority, tensions between cul- tural ideals of peace and harmony and the reality of bickering hostility masked behind the face of politeness and mannerism, paradoxical com- binations of ready submission to and ready abandonment of authority, basic social rhythms of ho-p'ing and hun luan, alternations between "harmony" and the "confusion" of vented aggression, and the dynastic cycle. Although the foregoing theses are ingenious and interesting, their status as empirically proved propositions remains in doubt. In setting forth his assertion concerning the sudden transition from one stage to another, Solomon makes no reference whatsoever to previ- ous anthropological field investigations or psychological studies. Nor 26 Albert Bandura and Richard H. Walters, Social Learning and Personality Develop- ment (New York i963), I30.</page><page sequence="15">622 WORLD POLITICS does he quote any of his respondents to "prove" his assertion (contrary to his usual practice). And yet this notion is vital to his attempt to theorize about presumed Chinese ambivalence toward authority. There is also the problem of transferring concepts from one culture to another. In a review of recent Sinological studies, Tang Tsou points out and cautions against some of the pitfalls of unreserved and careless application of concepts and theoretical insights originally developed by Western social scientists-rooted in Western cultural tradition- to characterize, explain, and theorize about the Chinese experience which has a vastly different cultural pattern and historical develop- ment." The criticism is applicable to Solomon's work. Freudian psychoanalysis posits that persons who experience oral in- dulgence in childhood, and consequently develop a great fondness for food and drink, tend to manifest passivity and dependency in their dealings with others, especially their superiors, and are always in search of a "magic helper." Although it may be suggestive and useful in or- ganizing a great deal of data, the thesis has not been clearly proved in empirical studies. Gerald S. Blum and Daniel R. Miller tried to test this psychoanalytically inspired insight. Their findings, although lending support to the hypothesis that oral indulgence in childhood tends to be significantly correlated with the oral characteristics identified above, show that correlations between orality and dependency are equivocal, with one being significant (r=.5) and the other insignificant (r=.i), depending upon how the concept "dependency" is operationally de- fined and measured.28 In view of this inconclusiveness in the Western cultural setting, in which the thesis of orality first originated, one won- ders how useful it is as a "theory" to account for certain Chinese per- sonality traits (dependency and passivity, lethargy and lack of initiative, indifference, fear of assuming responsibility, the constant search for a "magic helper"-i.e., authority-and the presumed ambivalence be- fore authority), identified by Solomon as forming part of Chinese "dependency social orientation." If individuals reared in an "oral culture" tend to develop "oral char- acter" which forms part of a "dependency social orientation," as Solo- mon's theory posits, then how does one account for cases of extraordi- nary filial piety in which sons or daughters went to the extreme to ful- fill the obligations called for by the cultural ideal? The individuals 27 Tang Tsou, "Western Concepts and China's Historical Experience," World Poli- tics, xxi (July i969), 655-9i. 28Gerald S. Blum and Daniel R.

These kinds of filial acts "did not remain as ideal literature but were somtimes copied to the letter by sons or daughters"29 and are often found in the local gazetteers and genealogical records. The per- sonality traits exemplified by this type of behavior demonstrate any- thing but passivity, lethargy, lack of initiative, or more concern with being loved than with loving. III Solomon, in the best tradition of writers on culture, personality, and national character, has attempted to explain adult Chinese political behavior and culture almost exclusively in terms of socialization during childhood-to the neglect of continuing socializing experiences during adulthood. Although the assumption of the predominant importance of early socialization appears plausible to many social scientists, it re- mains an unproven assumption. Enthusiasm for it is not uniformly shared by all students of personality, culture, and political socialization. Herbert H. Hyman, for instance, has suggested that a number of other factors, particularly adult experiences, may better explain certain polit- ical behavior.30 The view that personality configuration is molded in pre-adolescent childhood implies that personality does not change, or changes only in minor ways in response to later experiences and cultural influences. This view reflects an uncritical commitment to Freudian theory which, while plausible, remains largely unsubstantiated. If personality is con- ceived as a system of responses arising in a cultural matrix, the individ- ual lives his entire life within such a matrix and is never independent of it. Why then, unless one assumes that learning and organization of responses take place only in childhood, should childhood experience be accorded so much weight, and later experience be largely ignored ?"' 29 Francis L. K. Hsu, Americans and Chinese, rev. ed. (New York I970), 79. 30Herbert H. Hyman, Political Socialization (Glencoe, Ill. I959), 72 and passim. 31 Uncritical adherence to this view could at times lead to ridiculous theorizing. Ac- cording to Solomon, adult Chinese submissiveness, ambivalence, and impotence before authority is largely a function of interaction with the father in childhood. If this theory were correct, then the increasing insubordination, rebelliousness, and readiness to chal- lenge the constituted "authority" (i.e., "the white power structure"), by post-I954 Ameri- can blacks and other ethnic minorities might be explained in terms of a profound change in the way in which these groups have raised their children in the recent past; and the rebellion of the students in the i960's might be explained in terms of the increasing permissiveness with which middle-class white Americans have raised their children in the recent past; and the relative reticence and subsidence of the campus rebellion in</page><page sequence="17">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 625 This more or less exclusive orientation and narrow theoretical per- spective is further complicated by Solomon's other basic assumption. Instead of viewing the relationship between culture and institutions as being one of circular and cumulative causation, he perceives the two to be dichotomous: "It is our basic assumption that China's difficulties in responding to the changing world of the past century have been largely cultural and psychological in quality rather than institutional or eco- nomic" (p. i). Far from being dichotomous, the two are mutually, causally interrelated. Under "normal" circumstances, attitudes and cul- tures tend to support institutions and to be supported by them at the same time.32 The result of all this is what one may call, for lack of a better term, "diaperological determinism," or "political diaperology." It is a theory that explains virtually every significant manifestation of political be- havior and culture of a society almost exclusively in terms of childhood experience, and virtually neglects historically, economically, and insti- tutionally determined factors. The picture of Chinese modal personality and political culture that emerges from Solomon's study is one of political passivity and indif- ference, meekness and subservience in the face of authority, panicky fear of assuming responsibility, and lack of initiative. The Chinese are described as perceiving politics as a dangerous "tiger world," and as regarding the political and bureaucratic authorities as distant, aloof, harsh, manipulative, and uncontrollable. Most social scientists who have had first-hand experience with both the Chinese and the Western cul- the last two or three years might again be accounted for in terms of a return to a less permissive child-rearing practice in the still more recent past. The "women's lib" move- ment might be explained in the same manner, and so forth and so forth. But what ridiculous explanations all these must appear to many, if not all of us. Assuming that Solomon's theory is correct and his exposition of Chairman Mao's motives for stirring up the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" (which constitutes part of his explana- tion for that great turmoil and upheaval) is also correct, then the most effective and the least painless way to change the political culture of China would have been for the Chairman to call upon the parents of the whole nation to "go all the way out" to "emulate" and "surpass" the American way of raising kids a la Dr. Spock, rather than to launch the Cultural Revolution-and thereby avoiding its tremendous costs. 32For the idea of circular causation, see Gunnar Myrdal, An American Dilemma (New York I944), 75ff., and Appendix 3, i065ff.; and Gunnar Myrdal, Asian Drama (New York i968), Appendix 2, especially i844-47. By attempting to account for per- sonality and culture exclusively in terms of child-rearing practices, students of per- sonality and culture have a hard time explaining away personality and cultural changes in a society where child-rearing practices have remained virtually unchanged. For a study that shows that attitude and behavior toward authority could and did change in spite of the persistence of traditional child-rearing practices, see Margaret Mead, New Lines for Old: Cultural Transformation, Manus I928-53 (New York i956).</page><page sequence="18">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 627 tures, especially the American, would readily concur in such character- izations. I, for one, readily subscribe to all of these, but the agreement ends there. I find it hard to accept Solomon's self-imposed narrow theoretical perspective and explanations. To begin with, in China as elsewhere, the father is not the only authority figure a child encounters before reaching adulthood. Throughout his life, a person in traditional China was required by custom to submit not only to the authority of his father but also that of the tsu (clan) of which he was a member. The tsu (or its founder or current leaders) prescribed rules of personal conduct (e.g., filial piety, deferring to one's seniors, supporting aged parents, the merit of jang, i.e., yielding to others in the interest of avoid- ing conflict) for its members, and enforced the rules through rewards and punishments available to it, with the sanction of imperial law and the approval of administrative authorities.33 In addition, a child from a well-to-do family encountered a secondary socializing agent, namely the tutor, as soon as he reached school age. By all accounts, the pupil- tutor relationship in traditional China (and to a lesser extent in con- temporary China and Taiwan) was one of submission and domination, of taking orders and giving orders. The tutor was expected to be a surrogate father, and was in practice despotic, dictatorial, stern, distant, and harsh. The parents eagerly delegated disciplinary authority, includ- ing severe physical punishment, to the tutor and exhorted their son to submit to and blindly obey the authority of the tutor. Thus, there ex- isted a high degree of congruence between the son-father relationship and the pupil-tutor relationship, with the latter tending to reinforce the former, resulting in the formation of the submissive personality trait which Solomon has correctly observed. There is, however, no reference in Solomon's study to the interacting relationship between the growing child and his tutor. This omission is surprising when one recalls that the majority of Solomon's respondents had schooling of one sort or another. Historical, economic, and institutional patterns provide other, equally plausible, explanations of behavior. Historically, the hsien magistrate, vis-a'-vis the commoner, was aloof, harsh, manipulative, and distant. His office, which was referred to as a "tiger gate," indeed administered legal justice without all the minimally necessary legal trappings and 33 Hui-chen Wang Liu, The Traditional Chinese Clan Rules (New York 1959), and "An Analysis of Chinese Clan Rules," in D. S. Nivison and A. F. Wright, eds., Con- fucianism in Action (Stanford I959); also Hsien-Chin Hu, The Common Descent Group in China and Its Functions, Viking Fund Publications in Anthropology, No. io (New York I948).</page><page sequence="19">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 629 procedural niceties that qualify as "civilized" legal processes.34 Politics in traditional and modern China was indeed a dangerous "tiger world," a "zero-sum game." The politicians and the bureaucrats were manipu- lative, untrustworthy, uncontrollable, arrogant, corrupt, and abused their position and status. For commoners, the best course to follow in dealings with them was to respect but to avoid them if possible, and to submit to their whims when contact became unavoidable. In a society where the Western idea and practice of rule of law is unheard of, and where there is no tradition of civil liberties and individual freedoms (as a matter of fact, there was no Chinese equivalent for the words "free- dom," "right," and "civil liberties" until the introduction of these ideas from the West in the late nineteenth century), an individual would only have courted more troubles by behaving differently. There also exists an institutional explanation for the oft-noted fear of imperial bureaucrats to assume responsibility and initiative; it is at least as convincing as Solomon's psychocultural explanation. Given the long tradition of absolute monarchial control of the apex of the im- perial bureaucracy with its "checks and balances,"35 given the tradi- tional rulers' refusal to delegate minimally adequate discretionary power to the provincial and local officials while holding them account- able for everything that went wrong,36 the best course for an average bureaucrat to follow, in the interest of sheer survival, was to assume as little responsibility and take as little initiative as circumstances allowed. Given the vast difference between "floating in the official sea" and being "in the wilderness," a bureaucrat was likely to go out of his way to please his superior in the interest of "job security," and to submit to a new authority when there was a change in dynasty. Further, given the enormous monetary investment required to obtain a bureaucratic posi- tion and the meager official salary (which was inadequate for main- taining his office, much less paying off his debts),37 a bureaucrat was likely to bully his inferiors, and to squeeze and plunder as much as he could while in office. In short, political culture and personality traits are shaped as much 34 See Sybill Van der Sprenkel, Legal Institutions in Manchu China (London i962), especially chap. 6. 35 Ping-ti Ho, "Salient Aspects of China's Heritage," in Ping-ti Ho and Tang Tsou, eds., China's Heritage and the Communist Political System (Chicago i968). 36Kuang-chuan Hsiao, Rural China: Imperial Control in the Nineteenth Century (Seattle i960), passim. 37 T'ung-tsu Ch'u, Local Government in China Under the Ch'ing (Cambridge, Mass. i962).</page><page sequence="20">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 631 by economic, institutional, and historical factors38 as they are by the interactions of individuals with their parents in early childhood. The Chinese Communists have been acutely aware of this and have striven very hard since at least 1940 to combat this situation. Through the institutionalization of the hsia-fang (downward transfer) system and the periodic party and bureaucratic shake-ups by means of rectification campaigns (the latest and the greatest of which was of course the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution), Chinese Communist leaders have attempted to check the inherent tendency of those in power to abuse their position and to claim privileges. By accelerating the trend toward universal education and by introducing measures designed to reduce the "three great differences" (i.e., income and other differences between rural and urban areas, between peasants and workers, and between intellectual and manual labor), they have attempted to reduce the psychological and status distance between the cadres and the masses, between superiors and inferiors, and between the leaders and the led. By insisting on a "mass line" approach, they have hoped to institution- alize mass participation in implementing but not necessarily in making policy, and thus to reduce the mass apathy and alienation so character- istic of the Soviet system. Finally, but not least importantly, through the nation's educational system39 and the institutionalization of political study sessions replete with criticism and self-criticism, and through con- stant exhortation to "serve the people," Communist leaders have at- tempted to eliminate the traditional attitude that regards a bureaucratic position and advancement as the natural and most honorable way of getting ahead and getting rich, and instead to inculcate the socialist norm that insists that a cadre or bureaucratic position be a "civil service" 38 Among studies that also attempt to account for the oft-noted Chinese submissive- ness to authority, I would single out Fei (fn. i8), and Francis L. K. Hsu, "The Effect of Dominant Kinship Relationships on Kin and Non-Kin Behavior: A Hypothesis," American Anthropologist, LXVII (June i965), 638-6i. Contrary to Solomon, Hsu argues in this article that "the individual reared in the father-son dominated system [an ex- ample of which being the traditional Chinese society] will have no resentment against benevolent authority, in fact, he will love it" (653). Consider also the following state- ments by Hsu: "[In a father-son dominated system] the superior does not have to dis- guise his power because he knows this is his due, and the subordinate has no need to disguise his obeisance since it is not necessary to be ashamed of it. Authority and com- pliance to authority are therefore carried out openly and elaborately with no qualms on either side. Difficulties may arise if the superior becomes too oppressive, but the salvation of the oppressed lies in finding individual relief from it, not in changing the entire social structure in which such oppression occurs" (652-53). This seems to be as plausible as Solomon's psychocultural explanation for the fact that, until the twen- tieth century, China had experienced numerous rebellions but no revolution. 39 For themes emphasized in Chinese school texts, see Ridly (fn. 6).</page><page sequence="21">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 633 in the true sense of the term. To be sure, most of these institutionalized measures are essentially "checks from above" and not the "checks from below" that are prevalent in a functioning pluralistic democratic polity. Their long-term effectiveness is therefore still in doubt, although for the time being they seem to work well. Well-entrenched bureaucrats have typically been able to circumvent institutionalized arrangements designed to restrain them. Genuine and effective checks against the inherent tendencies of an authoritarian, bureaucratic system entail evo- lution toward a more symmetrical distribution of power, genuine dele- gation of power to the grass roots, evolution toward rule of law with ever-strengthened constitutional guarantees of civil liberties, and legiti- mization of political opposition. But those are precisely the kinds of de- velopments the Communist leadership will not allow to take place for the simple reason that the pOst-I949 revolution has largely been a revolution from above. To impose revolutionary transformation from above, the party leaders need a monolithic, omnipotent bureaucracy capable of penetrating the society and controlling and mobilizing the population. The development of such a bureaucracy almost inevitably generates the tendencies previously described. Chinese Communist leaders, especially Mao, have been acutely aware of this dilemma and have tried their best to solve it. But the weight of cultural heritage and institutional legacy has been against them. In a sense (and this is only one of the many senses that one can conceive), it is correct to characterize the Cultural Revolution as the Chairman's last-ditch effort to shake up and cleanse the Chinese nation from its traditional cultural shackles and psychological "hang-ups" through a mass "speak-out" and "act-out" in a vast encounter session involving millions of participants, some voluntary and others not so voluntary. Needless to say, the Cultural Revolution has been more than a gigantic encounter session, however one may interpret such a great political turmoil from a narrow psychoanalytical perspective. Another picture that emerges from Solomon's analysis is the low threshold of tolerance for confusion on the part of his respondents. The Chinese in his sample are obsessed with preserving social order and tranquillity and show little tolerance for hun luan (confusion, chaos). His explanations sound convincing, but can hardly tell the whole story. During the last hundred years, China has been in an extreme state of social breakdown and political chaos; it is not simply another inter- regnum in dynastic cycles. Persons growing up in this period of un- precedented chaos and turmoil naturally long for tranquillity and social</page><page sequence="22">CHINESE NATIONAL CHARACTER 635 order, whether or not there is a cultural tradition that places a pre- mium on interpersonal harmony and peace.40 IV To recapitulate, Solomon presents a qualitatively suggestive but quan- titatively inconclusive analysis of the Chinese modal personality con- figuration and political culture, and their relationship to Chinese child- rearing practice. His theory of a social dependency orientation (or of a dependent political culture) has yet to be proven and clarified by further investigation. The skills and requirements of undertaking such a gestalt description of a cultural area as large as China are so immense and so numerous that the task must appear hopelessly im- possible to one not imbued with the psychocultural fervor. One may admire the boldness of his attempt and the imaginativeness and inge- nuity with which he analyzes and makes sweeping, unqualified gen- eralizations, but one must view the results and the methods of proof with a generous measure of skepticism. 40One is reminded of President Nixon's successful capture of the White House in i968 with the rhetoric "I have a plan to end the Vietnam War" and the promise to restore "law and order" and to stop "crime in the streets." The turmoil in this country in the mid-ig6o's is lilliputian compared with the upheaval and turmoil China under- went in the century following the Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion.</page></plain_text>
