<plain_text><page sequence="1">William Whewell, Of the Plurality of Worlds: a Facsimile of the First Edition of 1853; Plus Previously Unpublished Material Excised by the Author Just Before the Book Went to Press; and Whewell's Dialogue Rebutting his Critics, Reprinted from the Second Edition, edited and with new introductory material by Michael Ruse, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001, Î½ + 510 pp., $50.00 ($20.00 paperback). William Whewell (1794-1866) was one of the two philosophers of science who are thought to have influenced the young Charles Darwin's thinking about scientific methodology. The other was John Herschel. Whewell's Plurality of Worlds provides an excellent example of the kind of metaphysical discussion that was going on in England while Darwin was completing his monograph on barnacles and looking forward with some trepidation to publishing his evolutionary ideas. Here the first edition (357 pages in length) is re-issued, as are some addenda that appeared in the second addition. Parts that were replaced shortly before the book was published are here made available for the first time, so that this is a valuable addition to the primary literature, and not just a reprint. In addition there is some excellent commentary by the editor. By the time that the book was written, the fact that the universe is very large and very old had become generally known. That suggested that our part of it is nothing particularly special, and neither, perhaps, are we. Whewell took it upon himself to hold back the flood of skepticism by a combination of the argument from design and the argument from law. Both notions depended upon a kind of anthropomorphism to which idealists like Whewell are particularly apt to fall prey. He evidently could not conceive of either design without a Designer or law without a Legislator. Darwin would in effect turn both of these arguments on their heads. The history of such anthropomorphic thinking is very interesting, for it shows the extent to which it has influenced even the best intellects. Of particular interest is Whewell's endorsement of Richard Owen's notions about Platonic Ideas and the role of the Archetypal Light (i.e., God) in the grand panorama of life through time. Some authors have suggested that Owen's thoughts about such matters were eccentric, or perhaps epiphenomenal, and not the sort of thing that his professional colleagues were apt to take seriously. Whewell's enthusiasm for Owen's views would seem to indicate that such idealistic notions were being taken very seriously indeed by some important and influential figures. Michael t.
