<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS OF A GEOLOGIST: G. H. TOULMIN (1754-1817) BY ROY S. PORTER Historians have become sensitized of late to the politics of science: the rivalries between and within scientific institutions, the jealousies of priority disputes, the strategies for winning public approval and swinging grants. Many of the leading British geologists active around the turn of the nineteenth century were themselves involved in orthodox party politics. Men such as George Bellas Greenough, first president of the Geological Society of London, and, later, George Poulett Scrope- "Pamphlet Scrope"-were Members of Parliament-possibly explaining why the Geological Society arranged its main debating room with a "parliamentary" seating plan. Jean Andre de Luc was deeply involved in international counter-revolutionary diplomacy. Towards the left of the spectrum, several of the early members of the Geological Society- especially the religious dissenters who had formed the core of the Askesian and British Mineralogical Societies-held radical views. James Parkinson, author of Organic Remains of 'a Former World (1804-11) had been an active member of the London Corresponding Society, and a prominent radical pamphleteer. Scarcely less politically mebroiled, in the defence of traditional Whiggery, was John Playfair, "illustrator" of James Hutton's Theory of the Earth.1 There has been less study, however, of how certain aspects of the approved intellectual content of geological science were themselves shaped at that time by political values and configurations. What was the legitimate subject matter of geology? What was to be excluded as taboo? What was scientific and safe? What were to be its proper methods? its relations with other disciplines such as theology and the human sciences? and its implications for man and society?-all these questions were being For the radicals of the Askesian Society see lan Inkster, "Science and society in the Metropolis: A preliminary examination of the social and institu- tional context of the Askesian Society of London, 1796-1807," Annals of Science, 34(1977), 1-32; and Roy Porter, The Making of Geology (Cambridge, 1977), ch. vi.

Resolutions were reached, partly by the preferences of the geologists themselves, and partly by outside pressures, imposed by the strains of the French Revolution, the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and radicalism and reaction at home. For precisely at this time, legitimating the method and content of science became a particularly delicate issue in the teeth of the widely- held conviction-propagated par excellence by Edmund Burke-that the French Revolution had been fomented by ideas and intellectuals; that theories had overthrown a society not otherwise unsound. Thus forewarned, protagonists like John Williams and Joseph Townsend sprang to condemn geological speculations which threatened to unseat cosmological-and hence social and religious-orthodoxies. Geologists guarded their own statements, and condemned those confreres who in- dulged in needlessly unsettling "theories" which dissolved the ground away from under society's feet, pronouncing instead their allegiance to rock-solid "facts."2 George Hoggart Toulmin (1754-1817), however, was one who, as I shall show, published his theory of the earth as an overt gesture of political radicalism. To propound the correct cosmology was for him a campaign in the world-historical struggle of truth, freedom, and progress against tradition and authority. Toulmin's theories did not become particularly influential in the development of mainstream British geology. For, despite the fact that he was one of the most forthright advocates of the Uniformitarian method, later geological Uniform- itarians, such as Charles Lyell, looked back not to Toulmin, but to James Hutton, via John Playfair's Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth. This paper rather aims to establish the importance of Toulmin's theories as an index of the intimate ideological interpenetration of polit- ical commitment and geological science at the end of the Enlightenment and the beginning of the Romantic Age.3 2Thus John Williams claimed that Hutton's so-called "eternalism" would lead to "atheism," "infidelity," "anarchy, confusion and misery."

For similar remarks by Joseph Townsend see The Character of Moses Established for Veracity as a Historian (2 vols., Bath, 1813-15), I, 377-78. The Rev. George Graydon be- lieved that geological theories had been too often used "to excite and diffuse doubts of the most essential truths," . . . "to sap the foundations of religion and with it of both private and public virtue, order and happiness, and indeed the very existence of civil society."

Garfinkle, "Science and Religion in England 1790-1800: The Critical Response to the Work of Erasmus Darwin," Journal of the History of Ideas, 16(1955), 376-88, and Porter, op. cit. (n.1), chs. vi-viii. 3I have discussed the complex issue of Toulmin's influence-or the lack of it-on later geology at some length in my "George Hoggart Toulmin's Theory of Man and the Earth in the Light of the Development of British Geology," Annals</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS IN GEOLOGY 437 But as well as examining the political strategies attending the issuing and reception of geological theories, I also wish to focus atten- tion on a frequently neglected dimension of the politics of science. This is how the content of a scientist's work-his ideas (here, a theory of the earth), his imagery, metaphors, and perhaps above all his very language -embodies a mental world which is continuous with his own, and his age's, wider consciousness. Language carries-sometimes subliminally- the values and preoccupations of the scientist's everyday social percep- tion, and reveals its extent, limits, and configurations, incorporating these into scientific "realizations" of nature.4 Examination of such scientific projections in turn reveals at a subtle level the contours of the scientist's socio-political engagement. Toulmin needs to be subjected to such an analysis. For he was purporting to offer an explicit, holistic, cosmic philosophy, establishing the relations-past, present, and future-be- tween man and nature. Yet, his cosmology contains more equivocations than first meet the eye, and-in contrast, perhaps, to the Christian cos- mogonies of the late Stuart period, or the evolutionary theories of the Victorian age-it is difficult to sniff out its ambience and its bearings. These nuances alert us to the complexities of Toulmin's value-system, and to the ambivalent prescriptions for action flowing from his cosmology. George Hoggart Toulmin studied medicine at Edinburgh University.5 He became a medical practitioner, first perhaps in Sussex, and then certainty in the West Midlands, where he seem to have spent most of his of Science. It is well known that Toulmin's ideas bear close resemblance, in their uniformitarianism, to those of Hutton and his followers, and scholarly debate has raged as to whether Toulmin plagiarized from Hutton, or vice versa. For the latest discussion of these points see my "George Hoggart Toulmin and James Hutton: A Fresh Look," Builtin of the Geological Society of America. Self-con- fessed reactionaries like John Robison overtly recognized how radicals like Toul- min projected their politics onto nature and called for them to be separated: "It is amusing to observe the earnestness with which they recommend the study of natural history.

Little is known about his activities beyond what is stated in, and can be inferred from, his published writings. They fall into three groups. He first published his theory of the earth in The Antiquity and Duration of the World (1780). This was republished in slightly modified form in 1783 and 1785, finally appearing with considerable additions in 1789 as The Eternity of the Universe. Its main lines were restated in Toulmin's introduction to his translation of the geological parts of Chaptal's Elements of chemistry, which he completed in the early years of the nineteenth century but never published.6 Secondly, Toulmin published two medical works, The Instruments of Medicine, or the philosophical digest 'and practice of physic (1789), and the Elements of the Practice of Medicine on a Popular Plan . . . an elementary work for students (1810), which enthusiastically advocated the Brunonian system of medicine. Lastly, a collection of Toulmin's verse, entitled Illustrations of Affection, with other poems, was posthu- mously published in 1819. The fundamental thrust of Toulmin's geophilosophy was to establish the eternity of the earth, and hence of all forms of minerals, plants, and animals-man included-which populated it, as part of the eternity of the entire system of nature. The earth-like nature in general-he viewed as self-contained, and self-sustaining. No evidence indicated that the earth had ever enjoyed, or suffered from, external divine intervention. There was no sign that the system of nature was in decline or coming to an end. Toulmin argued his case at various levels.7 He claimed that recorded human testimony as to the origins of the earth and of man could have no scientific value since it must necessarily long post-date the events. In any case, such creation myths betrayed all the marks of the savage and infantile mind. He evaluated actual geological evidence-of strata and fossils, and processes active in nature, such as denudation and vol- canic activity-to demonstrate that the earth gave no clues of its own beginnings, but clear proof of the eons of time required for forming the present distribution of continents and oceans, which themselves had been constituted out of the debris of previous systems. And he expounded an underlying philosophy of the terraqueous globe in which, while parts of the system rose and fell, changed, grew and decayed, nature seen as an entire system was complete, perfect, self-sufficient and unchanging: "And 6 The MS is owned by the Wellcome Institute of London, MS 4823, "Geology, being Chaptal's account of the stony substances of the world, illustrated with the most modern discoveries and analyses, also with notes and a preface explanatory of the true system of the universe." Though similar to Hutton's geology in many respects, Toulmin's never became influential. For an attempt to explain why, see Porter, op. cit. (n.3). 7For internal analysis of the argument and evidence used by Toulmin see my op. cit. (n.3).</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS IN GEOLOGY 439 yet, though matter ever thus is agitated,-and nature changes forms,- her forms do all exist. Though men are seen to die, or change existence, the human species flourish in eternal being," for "an unerring uniformity is preserved throughout the whole of nature."8 It is hardly necessary to stress that Toulmin's geohistory and philos- ophy represent a radical break with even the more liberal versions of Christian natural theology and geology sanctioned in the eighteenth century, as for example John Whitehurst's Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the Earth (1778).9 In place of an eternal God, nature and matter were set up as timeless. Instead of a teleological, hierarchical providentialism, Toulmin eliminated miracles, and postulated the abso- lute uniformity of the laws of nature. He denied to man any privileged place within the system of nature. Nature was perfectly indifferent to the rise and fall of successive civilizations. Man being "a small but necessary part" of nature,1' "our lives, and calculations, are but points in time and in nature."'' Toulmin's writings were indeed received as a deliberate challenge to Christian cosmology and belief. John Ogilvie, in his An Inquiry into the Causes of the Infidelity, and Scepticism of the Times (1783) rightly placed Toulmin in the British tradition of Enlightened free-thought which included Bolingbroke, Hume, and Gibbon. Ralph Sneyd, in his A Letter to Dr. Toulmin M.D. Relative to his book on the Antiquity of the World (1783) grasped how fundamental to Toulmin's strategy was his creed of the eternity of matter, and of atheism. Sneyd saw Toulmin as conspiring to destroy morality, justice, and society. For human life, banished from a kingdom of nature presided over by a wise, just, and personal God, must necessarily be reduced to a Hobbesian war of all against all. For this reason, Sneyd believed that although "the rack and gibbet" were now obsolete as instruments for chastising miscreants, it was a "disgrace" that Toulmin had been free under the law to publish, and advocated that he be locked away.12 s The Antiquity and Duration of the World (London. 1780), 120 and 194. (Henceforth AD.) 9 Note that Toulmin's theory is also thoroughly distinct from those of other British Uniformitarian geologists such as Hutton, Playfair and Lyell, in postu- lating the eternity of the earth, denying the existence of God, and viewing man in a totally naturalistic light. 10 The Eternity of the Universe (London, 1789), Introduction, A3.

Sneyd was a Sussex parson, and one- time fellow of All Souls. He attacked Toulmin's work mainly on theological and moral grounds, without arguing the geological exidence in any detail. Sneyd may have known Toulmin personally, for he was rector of Jevington and vicar of Rye in Sussex. A Dr. J. H. Toulmin appears as a Lewes physician in the Medical Register for 1783. It seems quite possible that this is a slip for G. H. Totllmin.</page><page sequence="6">440 ROY S. PORTER Toulmin's theory of the earth was of course meant to provoke such Christian anger.'3 For throughtout his geological writings he scorned and scoffed at religion, reserving special venom, in a thinly-veiled attack, for the Gothic barbarities of Christianity. Time and again, Toulmin char- acterized religious cosmologies as enthroning an alien God, invented by man in his own image, as a tyrant over man and nature. He argued that man's ignorant pride was responsible for inventing anthropocentric re- ligious myths which portrayed nature as created essentially for man's use and enjoyment.'4 Toulmin stigmatized such views as "errors," "delu- sions," "dreams," and "prejudices." The product of "ignorance," "folly," and "mistaken zeal," they were "fantastic" mind-forged manacles, "elaborate systems" which flourished because of the "credulity" of the "undiscerning multitude" and the craft of priests, those "elaborate fabricators" of "delusions" who had "imposed upon the senses of mankind" and labored "to render them incapable of judging." Such "enemies to liberal investigation" had made men "dupes to the artifice of system." Men had been "hood-winked" and "blind- folded" by a cosmological vision whose tone was "baneful" and "gloomy," and whose effect was to "debase" and "degrade" mankind.'5 Cosmo- logical superstition was Europe's unhappy patrimony. For Christianity had been the religion first of an "obscure" Near Eastern tribe, and then of those very Gothic barbarians who had devastated the civilized pag- anism of antiquity. The Christian cosmology-violent, animistic, pro- pitiating, anthropomorphic, and anthropocentric-epitomized primitive thought. "In an uncultivated age, when men were ignorant of the estab- lished laws of nature, every little incident was exaggerated, and might have been sufficient to have given birth to the most absurd and incredible conjectures."16 Hence, Toulmin was designedly fomenting a revolution in thought -along well-established Enlightenment lines.'7 In place of organized 13 In all his works, Toulmin presents himself as a daring innovator, working "almost unaided" (EU, Introduction), casting aside errors hallowed by authority and tradition. Thus in his The Instruments of Medicine (London, 1789), he writes, "The human species, opposing novelty and reformation, revolt at the bold and hazardous attempt. Imperfect beings--atoms in the scale of nature, and vain of the little knowledge they possess, they are unwilling to embrace improve- ment, and reject what is preferred for their good." Quoted in review in Critical Review, 67(1789), 333. The Analytical Review. 2(1789), 453, commented upon Toulmin's indulgence in self-advertisement and congratulation. 14 See for example AD, 190 and The Eternity of the World, 120f. 15 Such terms are so thickly and uniformly scattered throughout Toulmin's writings that it would be redundant to give precise references. 16 AD, 160. 17 Contrast the radicalism of Toulmin's thought relative to Humphry Davy's remarkable Consolations in Travel, or the Last Days of a Philosopher (London, 1830). In this, the character Philalethes enunciates cosmological opinions similar</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS IN GEOLOGY 441 religion, and its "received" and "common" opinions policed by "author- ity," he sought to articulate an ethic of knowledge, cosmic "Truth," securely grounded upon "Reason" and "Nature." Such truth could be discovered by "speculative minds" in a spirit of "truly philosophical" inquiry within the atmosphere of "refinement" and "liberality" created by the progress of civilization. With this "dawn of a bright day," "En- lightened" minds, with "cool," "calm," and "unprejudiced" thoughts could at last grasp the "simple," "elevated," and "extended" nature of the cosmic system, and thereby enhance "the dignity of the human species, and the splendour of the universe."'8 As a late Enlightenment free-thinker, offering a radically alternative cosmology, Toulmin was then indisputably politically engage. And, like any Christian apologist, Toulmin deemed that adherence to his own philosophy was essential for the harmony and happiness of mankind.'9 What then was the destiny of man which Toulmin thought his own natural philosophy would guarantee? Or, to put this question in another way, what political and moral values did Toulmin "naturalize" and "objectify" in his earth philosophy? For Toulmin, nature, "wise" and "good," was the ultimate source of values.20 Toulmin was above all a monist. He understood nature as a totality, a self-contained system, an organized economy. Every part played its proper role within the whole: "the closest sympathy and con- nection is preserved, throughout the entire system of things; and each part or member of the universe, in performing its proper offices, operates both to its own preservation and to that of the whole."21 Subordinating each member to the whole was a system of uniform and inviolable natural laws which maintained an eternal "circle of existence."22 "Nature is invariably the same, her laws eternal and immutable."23 to Toulmin's. But because in Davy's work they are submerged in a dialogue form, together with many other opinions, any radical edge is quite blunted. 18 EU, 83. Clearly, in taking up this stance, Toulmin was not breaking abso- lutely new ground, but was wielding the long-tried weapons of the nature English Deist and free-thinking tradition and of the continental philosophes. The paral- lels in content and tone to d'Holbach's Systeme de la Nature are specially notice- able. See A. O. Lovejoy's essay, "The Parallelism of Deism and Classicism," Essays in the History of Ideas (Baltimore, 1948), 78-98 for the Enlightenment uses of the idea of the uniformity of nature. Toulmin's thought also echoes the rhetoric of free-masonry, with which he may well have been connected, given the activity in the movement of his mentor and friend, Dr. John Brown. 1 have been able to find, however, no positive evidence of a link. 19 AD, Introduction, v, 7, 103. 20 AD, 196-97; EU Introduction A3. 21 AD, 197-98.

PORTER Nature's manifestations certainly underwent change, locally and tem- porally, for nature was the source of energy, life, and activity ("Nature lives in motion").24 But the function of change in nature was to preserve the overall stability, order, and form of the whole. Individuals died but the race lived. There was a total circulation of matter, but no species became extinct or came into being.25 Thus in nature change was only, at bottom, appearance, change relative to other parts, without any abso- lute change in the whole. Toulmin was an "extreme uniformitarian."26 In the same way, there might appear to be "disorder" in nature, but this was merely an illusion, the product of human myopia.27 Volcanoes, earthquakes, and similar cataclysms were actually part of nature's design for preserving the order of the whole, and they acted under nature's laws.28 As with "disorder," so with violence; for to man, nature might seem violent. But from the perspective of the entire system, nature's operations were all in fact "gradual." Thus continents were "gradually formed" and "subject to gradual decay."29 It is in this light, moreover, that we must understand two of the key concepts in Toulmin's usage: "progression" and "revolution." When characterizing the changes of nature or of civilization, Toulmin used the notion of "progression" not to imply continuous, inevitable, irreversible, unilinear improvement, but rather to convey how everything in nature proceeded by steps, by degrees.30 Thus he frequently wrote of the "slow, progressive and uniform formation" of rocks,""3 or the "gradual pro- gression of Nature."32 Progress was not the governing law of develop- ment, as for Condorcet or Erasmus Darwin, but a description of the manner in which change occurred. Thus, he wrote, even volcanoes, the "fleeting children of Nature" had their "rise, their progress, their extinc- tion."33 Similarly, when Toulmin characterized nature as a theatre of "continuous revolutions," he was never highlighting violence, disorder, or the rupturing of the fundamental system of things. The thrust of the 24 AD, 172: "These immutable truths should never be forgot: That animals and vegetables flourish and decay; that earths are formed by slow degrees; that they too change by time; that stone is formed, is decomposed, or altered in its composition; that mountains now are elevated, now depressed;-that nature lives in motion." 25 EU, 130, 183. Toulmin thus denied (like Hutton and Lamarck) that there was any extinction of species, or even substantial degeneration. EU, 102-04. 26 Thus in typical eighteenth century style, Toulmin asserts the fundamental uniformity of human nature, despite the superficial differences between nation and nation, civilized and uncivilized peoples. EU, 183. For Toulmin as an "extreme uniformitarian" see R. Hooykaas, "Geological Uniformitarianism and Evolution," Archives Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences, 19(1966), 3-19. 27 EU, 85.

Revolutions in nature, Toulmin emphasized, were "slow;" there was an "uninterrupted succession of events."34 Toulmin's basic vision of nature, as a cyclical, stable, law-governed, gradualistic system, is the key also to his vision of, and prescriptions for, man. Indeed, his ontology demands that this should be so. For he had opted for a remarkably thorough-going monistic naturalism, believing that man was utterly part of nature, subject to nature's laws, and no more than a "small but necessary part" of the total system of things.35 Primitive man's attention had focussed on himself. The savage had projected his self-image onto that personified fiction of man's mind, God, and thereby obtained a distorted categorization of the order of things; a picture in which man and nature were dichotomized; in which order and disorder, violence and calm, law and miracle, progress and decay, birth and death were erroneously pitted against each other. But enlightened man, with his nature-oriented vision, having understood his "relative situation in life,"36 would see all these dichotomies reconciled and trans- cended in nature. Man must cease pretending to "domineer it over nature" for he is subject to nature's laws.37 Each individual must learn that he is but an episode in universal history.38 What then were the laws of nature to which man must acknowledge his subjection? Fundamentally, these were the same laws as governed the cosmos in general. The human species had always been preserved, and always would be, approximately in a steady-state condition in respect of overall population, refinement and knowledge. Human nature was uniform, and the oscillations between barbarism and civilization rela- tively slight: "even the utmost degree of refinement, that mankind is capable of attaining, is but a shade of variation from the rude arts and manners of the less enlightened parts of the human species."39 Such a stability was maintained through a comprehensive cycle of human affairs. Races, civilizations, peoples, empires rose and fell, spread and con- tracted.40 To some extent the laws governing social changes were those 34 EU, 10. Cf. AD, 174: "slow but interesting revolutions." For the eighteenth century nuances of "revolution" see I. B. Cohen, "The Eighteenth Century Ori- gins of the concept of Scientific Revolution," J. H. I., 37(1976), 257-88. 35 EU, Introduction.

PORTER of the environment: favorable climatic conditions would encourage eco- nomic and cultural development, but then natural cataclysms would subsequently blight man's precarious achievements. To some extent, they were laws internal to man's own quest for improvement, fame, knowledge, and liberty, which would excite advances in civilization; but luxury and corruption would ensue, spelling inner collapse, or the van- quishing of that culture by barbarian invaders. "Human knowledge and civilization are, at best, but superficial and imperfect."41 Thus all civilization was inherently precarious: "to what unspeakable fluctuations is it subject!"42 A tiny remnant only of the famed and recent Graeco-Roman culture had survived "the wreck of time," and that "by the merest accident."43 There was no net accumulation of wisdom, science, morality, wealth, or economic development in human affairs, precisely because civilized nations were continually supplanted by less civilized ones.44 This cycle must persist without an escape for man from such natural trammels, partly because his environmental condition was so subject to the depredations of nature; and partly because of his psychology. For in all societies, Toulmin believed, the masses were necessarily stupid, ignorant, credulous and easily duped. These irremedial psycho- logical traits militated against their making great cultural achievements. Such people were always apt to be exploited by a caste of cunning and ruthless tyrants and priests.45 Certainly, a third group in society, an elite minority of lovers of truth, the "inestimable few," might battle against the forces of bigotry and barbarism, but could expect no cumulative gains: "The great and illustrious characters that have enlightened the world, have generally fallen a sacrifice to the madness and folly of mankind."46 Toulmin's political stance, then, articulated in his philosophy of man in nature, was one of outrage but ultimate resignation. Nature scotched 41 EU, 183; cf., EU, 17 and AD, 157. 42 AD, 13. 43 AD, 20. 44 EU, 19, 48-49. Toulmin was deeply impressed by the Gibbonian vision of the civilization of Greece and Rome destroyed by Christianity and barbarism. He saw the "deluge" of barbarian invaders from the North precisely as another natural catastrophe of the kind which periodically overtook human affairs. For Toulmin's disillusioned bleakness as characteristic of his age, see H. Vyver- berg, Historical Pessimism in the French Enlightenment (Cambridge, Mass., 1958), and J. G. A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment (Princeton, 1975). Note that especially in EU, Toulmin stressed the cosmic wisdom of the ancient Indian sages, and of the Pythagoreans, to demonstrate how there had been no significant intellectual advance over millennia, and that there was nothing new under the sun. EU, 37, 83. 45 EU, 213-14. 46 EU, 212, 179. Such total intellectual elitism pervaded Toulmin's writings. It is of course typical of the Deist/free-thinker pose.</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS IN GEOLOGY 445 hopes of any major transformation which would permanently improve society, because, like so many other philosophes, Deists, and free- thinkers, Toulmin could consider the masses only as an unmoveable and unimproveable threat.47 The limits of political action were defined for him by the limits of knowledge. The struggle for Toulmin could be intellectual: "We have fought for truth."48 Toulmin epitomizes the rad- ical intelligentsia's belief that liberation comes through expanded rational consciousness: sapere aude. In his commitment to emancipation through knowledge, he believed that truth secured happiness and welfare, just as, conversely, the roots of social malaise were misguided ideas: "men are invariably virtuous in proportion as they have clear perceptions of things."49 Emancipated from intellectual slavery, men could pursue love of humanity, sympathy, benevolence and virtue. Virtue resides in pro- moting the welfare of mankind, and is its own reward.50 But this stance of course contained a negative corollary. From his vantage point as a middle class but marginal intellectual, he could recognize no other appro- priate course for society than the individual pursuit of knowledge and virtue, by the few qualified to pursue them. Men must cure themselves. Au fond, he was, in Vyverberg's phrase, a "historical pessimist." In one sense, Toulmin's philosophical radicalism merely reproduced and legitimated his own life-situation, as a professional physician diag- nosing the sick. In another, he stated a reality about his own career in Brunonian medicine in writing that true philosophers "expose themselves to the censure of the greatest part of the world."5S And, in a more gen- eral perspective, his stance focusses the Kantian paradoxes of the liberal intelligentsia of late Enlightenment England (or, one might say, by extension, in the emergent capitalist state). At bottom, Toulmin's social convictions rendered any ultimate human progress unthinkable. Because of the "instability and fluctuations" of life there were "insuperable bar- riers" to the "progress of civilizations"-thus "our boasted civilization at some future period, may no longer exist."52 Nature's laws extinguished utopian expectations. Hence, self-improvement and individual knowl- edge were his prescription. Man must respect his place in nature: "the greatest and most difficult of all knowledge is to become sensible how little we know."53 Toulmin's attitude was thus that of the disinterested philosopher pursuing objective truth for moral liberation. He validated this stance by projecting ultimate values onto nature, which became the embodiment 47 AD, 179; EU, 3. 4 AD, Introduction, v. 49EU, 7. Cf.

"Every operation is stamped with wisdom and consistency."54 Evils in nature were partial and appar- ent. Catastrophes and cataclysms gave rise to new continents and new soil which ensure "long and happy" periods of fertility and "scenes of luxuriant vegetation."55 Furthermore, Toulmin actually developed a reverence for nature. Nature was full of "sympathy and connection,"56 constituting "a universe magnificent in its transcendent sublimity, splendour and magnificence." Nature consisted of "superior intelligences filling the immensity of space." Nature ensures "OUR PASSAGE TO THE REALMS OF BLISS, . . . WE DIE TO LIVE; TO SHINE WITH DAZZLING LUSTRE; AND TO ENJOY A PERMANENT AND SUBSTANTIAL HAPPINESS."57 The consequence of stigmatizing most of mankind, and of denying the prospects of the long-term improvement of society, was for the individual to worship nature through the perfection of his own reason. Thus Toul- min's system swung on an axis between two poles: one an objective, self-existent, independent nature: the other, independent man, nobly pursuing truth and humanity with liberality and detachment, in a human world of ignorance, hostility, and flux. The dignity of man was guaran- teed by the eternal objectivity and integrity of nature. No tyrant God, tyrant king, or mob, or fear of annihilation, threatened human dignity.58 All such views appeared in Toulmin's geological writings penned in the 1780s. It is important then to examine the impact on his thought of the turmoil of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, which can partially be gauged from his volume of poems, Illustrations of Affec- tion, published in 1819, and clearly written after about 1810. It is, perhaps, significant that Toulmin seems to have switched dur- ing this period, even as his career progressed, from Earth science to writing verse. His approach and style had always been profoundly declamatory, aimed to communicate wonder, rapture, and sublimity.59 54 AD, 196. -&gt;- AD, 136. 56 AD, 197. 57 EU, Introduction. Toulmin's "superior" doctrine of immortality ensures the eternity of man as a race. "Death" is transcended by matter taking on new forms. Toulmin's interest in Hindu philosophy may be of importance here. 58Toulmin's elevated espousal of humanity and virtue is typical of the so-called proto-Jacobin strain of late eighteenth century English moral senti- ment. Cf. Crane Brinton, The Political Ideas of the English Romanticists (Ox- ford, 1926), ch. I, "Jacobin and Anti-Jacobin"; G. Kelly, The English Jacobin Novel, 1780-1805 (Oxford, 1976); C. Cone, The English Jacobins (New York, 1968). Characteristic also was Toulmin's frequently-expressed disgust for the blood-thirsty imperialism of European nations which imposed their power and "crude and intolerant doctrines" upon innocent primitives and the docile civiliza- tions of the East. EU, 43, 244. 59 This was pointed out by hostile reviewers. See Monthly Review, 54(1781), 412-13, reviewing The Antiquity and Duration of the World.</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS IN GEOLOGY 447 Like Shelley, Toulmin may have grown to recognize that the bardic style rather than the natural philosopher's was his true metier. He may also have rightly perceived that speculative radical philosophical theories of the earth would find no audience in Britain at the turn of the century, whereas the more oblique and metaphorical medium of poetry could more acceptably convey his world-view.60 The Illustrations of Affection transmit many ideas which are familiar from Toulmin's earlier works. Organized religion, priestcraft, tyranny and despotism were all torpedoed.61 Freedom was celebrated.62 The cycles of nature, the fluctuations of life and death, of man and civiliza- tions remained ever-present strains.63 Toulmin conjured up the ever- varying sights of landscape, with holy awe.64 But the use of such themes had become significantly nuanced. His attacks upon the restored reac- tionary powers of post-1815 Europe65 were now accompanied by an equally fierce hostility to all things French.66 Toulmin could spare no word of praise for the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity of the French Revolutionary dawn. The struggle of the previous thirty years he envisaged as a fight a l'outrance between French imperialism and various "patriot" powers of Europe, of whom Britain (led by heroes such as Nelson and Wellington) was the savior.67 60 For Shelly as scientist-bard, see Desmond King-Hele, Shelley, his Thought and Work (London, 1960; 2nd ed., 1971); for the hostile climate of the times see the works cited in note 2 above. 61 Illustrations of Affection with Other Poems (London, 1819), 14 (for at- tack on bigotry); 16 (for attack on superstition, credulity, and religious barbarity); 17 (for attack on censorship). (Henceforth IA.) 62 Thus there is a paean of praise for Charles James Fox. "His Country's champion, Liberty! and thine." (71) 63 Some of the poems have a deep elegaic "ubi sunt" strain. Thus "Carthage" notes the passing away of that great civilization; as does "Love and the Rose" on a more personal, microsmic level. And cf. also IA, 35: A brilliant track of light is seen afar, And gloom succeeds,-pale Superstition's sway, With tyrant pow'r, has quench'd the vivid ray. 64 Mountains abrupt, precipitous and bold, Whose cavern-depths, eternal snows infold; Where Nature's works exhibit, active, free, Stupendous, wild, a bold variety! IA, 34. 65 Thus Spain, he says, once again, "Beneath the pressure of a bigot bends." IA, 37. 66 Phrases like "Gallic perfidy" crop up throughout. 67 Thus he praised the love of liberty of the Swiss against the invading French. Switzerland was "inspiring liberty" while "France enslav'd." IA, 66. The poem "The Herefordshire Beacon" is straightforward, patriotic rant: England's brave sons thy throne defend, And nations sav'd by thee-in adoration bend; IA, 138.</page><page sequence="14">448 ROY S. PORTER The titular subject of the poem reveals that the summum desideratum for Toulmin has ceased to be the overthrow of barbaric gothic Christian- ity by the natural light of Reason, but has become Affection, the power of human love and sympathy.68 Toulmin's main poem consists of multi- plying variations on the theme that affection alone is needed to ensure harmony between husbands and wives, amongst the family, within the economy, in towns and countryside, in states and in nature. Affection, to be kindled by each individual in his heart, is offered as the remedy for every social and political problem.69 Toulmin's sympathies went out in particular to patriots; to human- itarians, like Wilberforce, for abolishing the slave trade;70 and to the poor with their short and simple annals. Toulmin's sentimental lines nakedly echo Gray's Elegy, for he elaborated an idealized version of pastoral England to exemplify affection as a panacea, now utterly dis- placing politics: The busy house-wife, and the grandam grey, Plac'd at the door to catch the sunny ray- The humble scenes of calm domestic life, Far from ambition's wiles and noise and strife;71 It is scarcely necessary to underline the mystifying unreality of this ver- sion of pastoral, written during the years of Alarm by a medical practi- tioner operating in the newly industrializing area of Wolverhampton The political quietism which had lurked behind the aggressive secular- izing naturalism of Toulmin's Eternity of the Universe has moved stage center.72 68 No limits fetter Nature's genial tie, O'er the wide earth pervades Humanity! (IA, 14). Nature excursive, free-no wish request, Affection thron'd supreme in ev'ry breast. (IA, 19). 69 Affection-unlike Toulmin's earlier "Reason"-is shown to be available to all. It was present in the golden age when Creation smil'd a genial pow'r to bless, And Nature teem'd with life and happiness! IA, 20, but is no less vital to civilized states. Similarly affection is The palace guest, but oft'ner seen to share With Liberty, the peasant's humble fare; IA, 54. Women are seen as particular dispensers of the grace of affection: Woman, 'tis Thee! In thy pure breast it shines, Ennobles man, his nature, form refines; 70 A, 60. Note how Toulmin now showed no hostility to Wilberforce's Christian evangelicism. 71IA, 79. 72 Thus Toulmin resolved the attainment of the goals of life into a question of individual moral self-improvement: IA, 94: How gain'd? By reason's mastry o'er the will- Passions, desires, that prompt the soul to ill.</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS IN GEOLOGY 449 Furthermore, in one respect, the later Toulmin has been decisively led by events to repudiate his radical past. He has abandoned his atheism/pantheism. Nature is now dethroned, and God restored tri- umphant. Indeed, it is no oversimplification to state that God emerges for Toulmin precisely to underwrite the general social order. For Toul- min explicitly invokes the Deity to silence those who questioned the order of things: Eternal God! Thy dispensation wise, Wisdom and human foresight mocks-defies:73 and to prove, in a Popean cosmic Toryism way, that ... this imperfect state for man is best, And good and evil perform a wise behest.74 Indeed, Toulmin goes so far as to lean upon God to guarantee the reward for virtue and the punishment for vice beyond the grave: For ruin'd hopes on earth no cure is giv'n- The soul impatient seeks repose in heav'n.75 Yet were from sorrows-cares-life's transit free, Affections-pleasures-love! would cease to be: Hope is extinct-when satisfied, possest, No future good excites the tranquil breast: Desire is dead-when all acquir'd, to gain, The craving wish, if possible-how vain! And love! exempt from hope and fear, desire- Extinguish'd in the breast the sacred fire! Even the apparent imperfections of human life thus contributed to man's moral ennoblement. 73 IA, 80. 74IA, 95. Furthermore, most evils were actually of man's own making: IA, 41: Man mars-nay more-perverts to other ends, The bounteous gifts the wise Creator sends. But even so, blind man Deems Nature faulty, and that God is wrong; From partial evils views that great design, Not from the whole, as Architect divine. IA, 40. 75 IA, 144. Cf., also 84: Man! conscious of his weakness, seeks above, Immortal aid in plenitude of love! But should he wilful err, in sinful pride Neglect that Pow'r from whence all good's supplied- In human frailty, weakness, foolish trust, Forgetting he is impotence and dust- Th'Almighty pities!-still does love divine, Ethereal-blest, around respondent shine.</page><page sequence="16">450 ROY S. PORTER Thus Sneyd and Oglivie are at last vindicated. Toulmin, the pre-1789 philosophical radical, offers by the 1810s a substantially orthodox cos- mology, to defuse political tension. Nevertheless Toulmin's abandoned radical geohistory actually was to live on. Not in the work of geological scientists, for insofar as they could adopt or utilize a uniformitarian view of earth history, it was not as propounded by Toulmin, but in the much less threatening formulation of Hutton, Playfair, and Lyell, which denied eternity to the earth system, and preserved an essentially non-naturalistic vision of man as a privileged actor in Creation. Toulmin's early ideas survived in the schemes of the rising secularist radicals of the 1820s and 1830s, and especially Richard Carlile, who republished The Antiquity and Duration of the World in 1824 (The Eternity of the Universe was reprinted in 1825 and 1837). Indeed the marriage of Toulmin-when d'Holbach, Helvetius, Diderot, Volney and other philosophes were also being republished by the radical presses-with artisan radicalism perfectly communicated for the needs of the new age not merely Toulmin's concrete opinions but above all his philosophical posture. For the Carlilean radicals-though of lower class-were, like Toulmin, at bottom individualistic liberal intellectuals whose prime target was to erect an alternative, secular, naturalistic cos- mology, rather than direct revolutionary political transformation.76 In this respect, the ideas of Toulmin, and the way they were deployed, illuminate the extent, and, no less, the limits, of the radicalism of secu- larizing scientific naturalism as a program generated by the Enlighten- ment and sustained by nineteenth-century radical reformers. Churchill College, Cambridge. Possible evidence that Toulmin had become reconciled to Christianity is that he dedicated a poem to "The Late Excellent Henry Kirke White," the Evangelical poet and hymn-writer. 76 For an account of the work of Carlile and contemporary secularists see Edward Royle, Victorian Infidels (Manchester, 1974), chs. I-III; and E. P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class (Harmondsworth, 1968), ch. XVI. Chris Green (University of Sussex) has argued in his "Natural History as Ideology in Britain, 1820-1860" an illuminating and generally convincing case to show that the Carlileans, in offering an alternative cosmology, were endorsing a basically liberal individualist, "bourgeois" stance, which looked chiefly to self- improvement within a supposedly eternal, fixed and given framework of "natural" social, political and economic laws. I am grateful to Mr. Green for allowing me to read his unpublished typescript.</page></plain_text>
