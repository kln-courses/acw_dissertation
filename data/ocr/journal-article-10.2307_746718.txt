<plain_text><page sequence="1">Orpheus Revisited: A Ten-Year Retrospect on the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto OWEN JANDER About ten years ago, this journal published my article "Beethoven's 'Orpheus in Hades': The Andante con moto of the Fourth Piano Con- certo."' Much water has since flowed under the bridge on this subject. I should like to present here a few corrections of my article, along with some additional information and some fresh insights. Above all, I welcome the opportunity to advance a couple of new hy- potheses regarding this eternally fascinating piece of music. SULZER'S RECOMMENDATION VIS-A'-VIS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC INSPIRED BY POETRY In seeking to understand Beethoven's intention as he composed the Andante con moto of his Fourth Piano Concerto, I erred in using the expression "program music." Were I now able to turn back the clock and rewrite, I would above all remove my enthusiastic declaration that this movement "may well be the most totally programmatic piece of music-great art music-ever composed" (p. 196). I still endorse my basic thought there, but that word pro- grammatic raises a red flag. True program mu- sic occurs, of course, when the composer pub- lishes a program, thus asking the listener to hear his music with specific ideas in mind, which is obviously not the case with the An- dante con moto of the Fourth Piano Concerto. Beethoven's achievement here is properly un- derstood only by working from history-his- tory, to be sure, as Beethoven knew it. It is evident that, during the early decades of his life, Beethoven was intrigued by Johann Georg Sulzer's ubiquitously read Allgemeine Theorie der schinen Kiinste, which was first published in two volumes, in 1771 and 1774.2 Such was the popularity of this treatise that it underwent several reprintings and enlarge- ments, culminating in an enormous four-vol- ume affair, in 1796. In his article "Instrumen- 19th-Century Music XIX/1 (Summer 1995). ? by The Re- gents of the University of California. 'This journal 8 (1985), 195-212. 2See my "Exploring Sulzer's Allgemeine Theorie as a Source Used by Beethoven," Beethoven Newsletter 2 (Spring 1987), 1-7. 31</page><page sequence="2">19TH CENTURY MUSIC talmusik," Sulzer repeats the eighteenth-cen- tury complaint that instrumental music, since it lacks a text, is incapable of expressing hu- man emotions. In order to correct this prob- lem, concludes Sulzer, the composer will do well always to imagine very distinctly the character of some person, or some situation, or some human emotion, and exercise his imagination to the point that he believes that he can hear what a person in such a situation would be saying. The composer can assist himself in this en- deavor by seeking out passages in literature that are pathetic, fiery, gentle, or tender, and to declaim these passages in an appropriate voice-and then translate these emotions into his music.3 To the best of my knowledge, Beethoven first acted on this recommendation when, in 1799, he wrote the Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato of his F-Major String Quartet, op. 18, no. 1- the movement that the composer himself pri- vately explained had been inspired by the crypt scene in Romeo and Juliet.4 In this particular enterprise Beethoven drew ideas not only from the familiar scene in Shakespeare's play but also from details in three widely performed Romeo and Juliet operas of the time: Georg Benda's Romeo und Julie (first performed in 1776), Daniel Steibelt's Romeo et Juliette (1793), and Antonio Zingarelli's Giulietta e Romeo (1796).5 This situation is similar to the An- dante con moto of the Fourth Piano Concerto, for which Beethoven drew ideas from not only the classical texts of Virgil and Ovid but also two widely admired Orpheus operas by Gluck and Naumann. The slow movement of the Quartet op. 18, no. 1, is structured as a Classical sonata form, the four sections of which can be said to corre- spond to these events in Shakespeare's scene: Exposition: Romeo contemplates the form of his beloved Juliet, whom he believes to be dead. Development: he cries out his despair and commits suicide by drinking poison. Recapitulation: Juliet awakes, discovers the body of Romeo alongside her, and cries out her despair. Coda: Juliet hears people approaching the tomb, seizes Romeo's dagger, stabs herself, and breathes her final sighs. This is the sort of undertaking that Carl Czerny had in mind when he wrote, regarding the slow movement of the C-Major Piano Sonata, op. 2, no. 3 (1794): In this Adagio is already displayed the romantic direction by which Beethoven, at a later period, cre- ated a species of composition which carried instru- mental music to such a pitch of refinement that it resembled even poetry and painting. In such works we no longer hear the mere expression of feelings, we see fine pictures-we hear the narration of cir- cumstances. But still, as music, the composition remains beautiful and unconstrained, and those ef- fects are always comprised within the bounds of regular form and consequent development.6 The details in Beethoven's Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato that reflect this musical-dra- matic plan are abundant. On the other hand, this Sulzerian enterprise runs on the rocks at one point-throughout most of the recapitula- tion, in fact-where, in order to honor the ex- pectations of musical return, the progress of the inspiring story must, for a minute or so, be put on hold. Beethoven learned a lesson from this musi- cal experiment. The vision of an instrumental composition that sets out to reflect a specific, continuous dramatic narrative will be at odds with any Classical form that involves sections of return-and virtually every Classical form, of course, involves sections of musical return. Accordingly, to achieve this strange goal of in- strumental music that reflects a dramatic nar- rative, it becomes necessary to abandon Classi- cal models of musical form. What must be cre- ated instead is an altogether new form, tailor made to address the events in the story. 3Johann Georg Sulzer, "Instrumentalmusik," Allgemeine Theorie der schonen Kiinste 2 (1792), 678. 4Thayer's Life of Beethoven, ed.

Paul Badura-Skoda [Vienna, 19701, p. 36). 32</page><page sequence="3">Beethoven returned to this challenge in the second movement of his Fourth Piano Con- certo. For this instrumental composition, based on the narrative of Orpheus in Hades, he cre- ated what must surely stand as one of music's most fascinatingly unique forms. With this youthful goal accomplished, Beethoven never again composed an instrumental work that, event after event after event, would be subser- vient to a dramatic narrative. UNIQUE FEATURES OF THIS MOVEMENT The Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Concerto is unique, in fact, on many important counts. To begin with, this is the only move- ment in any of the Beethoven piano concer- tos-plus the Triple Concerto-in which the solo piano abstains from its traditional sup- portive role as a continuo instrument.7 The reason for this is obvious: to have the solo piano (the Orpheus figure) join the outcries of the string instruments (who represent the Cho- rus of Furies) would scuttle the sense of dia- logue. Extremely important, the form of this Andante con moto is unique-a matter that has been discussed with keenest insight by Ed- ward T. Cone, in his "Beethoven's Orpheus- or Jander's? " Furthermore, if this piece is per- formed correctly, it stands as probably the briefest second movement in the entire litera- ture of the Classical concerto.9 The orchestration is also strange. Whereas the stage holds a full complement of wind in- struments, plus two trumpets and timpani (not heard in this concerto until m. 32 of the finale), in the second movement the "orchestration" engages only the strings. Also unusual is the music that Beethoven writes for the pianist. Nowhere is there the slightest suggestion of soloistic virtuosity. Indeed, the soloist's part in this movement can be performed by any musi- cian with only the most limited pianistic skill. More than that, the entire score of this move- ment-orchestra alternating with solo-can likewise be performed easily by any pianist with only modest coordination. On this sub- ject I speak with personal authority. If I, who am a most amateur pianist, can perform this full score-and I have done it often, for the purpose of demonstration-this "concerto movement" already stands apart, in a very odd way, from every other thing of its kind in the repertory. At no point in the progress of the movement do the soloist and the orchestra interact in the manner that music history has taught us to expect from the two partners in a concerto. The string choir and the solo pianist emerge from separate worlds, but even when their dif- ferences are reconciled, they never "consort" in the manner of the soloist and the orchestra in a concerto. Why is this movement so uncon- ventional? Internal evidence leads us to ques- tion whether the composition originated as a movement for a concerto at all. I believe that the composition we know as the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto was initially conceived as something else: a composition for solo piano. I next submit the obvious corollary hypoth- esis: that this Andante con moto is a transcrip- tion of an earlier work. Proof for this hypoth- esis could perhaps be found in the composer's sketches for the concerto, but these, alas, seem not to exist. To test the hypothesis, therefore, the best we can do is step to the piano and perform the "concerto movement" as a work for solo piano. In this way it emerges as a thing amazingly complete in itself. THE ANDANTE CON MOTO OF THE FOURTH PIANO CONCERTO PERFORMED AS A WORK FOR SOLO PIANO In the nineteenth century, two great musicians already understood that this "concerto move- ment" communicates in an altogether satisfy- ing-indeed, compelling-way as a vehicle for solo piano. In a report from 31 May 1840, Fanny 33 OWEN JANDER Orpheus Revisited 7See Tibor Szaisz, "Beethoven's basso continuo: Notation and Performance," Performing Beethoven, ed. Robin Stowell (Cambridge, 1994), pp. 1-22. On p. 2 Szaisz states: "The only exception is the slow movement of the Piano Concerto in G Major Op. 58 where keyboard continuo is excluded." 8This journal 8 (1985), 283-86. 9The second movements of Mozart's piano concertos on average take about seven to eight minutes in performance. If the second movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Con- certo is performed "Andante con moto," it lasts a bit over four minutes. (Regarding the fascinating problem of tempi for this movement, see pp. 46-48 of this article.)</page><page sequence="4">19TH CENTURY MUSIC Mendelssohn wrote her brother about her visit to the French Academy in Rome. She tells of playing four-hand music with the director of the Academy, the painter Jean-Auguste-Domi- nique Ingres, with the splash of a fountain in the background and with many bearded Acad- emy students (Gounod among them) "lying about on the steps and pedestals of the pillars in a state of unmitigated astonishment." She describes how, following this spontaneous mu- sic-making, she and Ingres "climbed up to the Campanile, where I had never been before, and from which I saw the splendid view for the last time in the light of the setting sun, not without many tears." After dinner the piano was moved into the main hall, for the Academy's celebrated musician-guest had agreed to treat the com- pany to an impromptu evening concert. (The instrument on which she performed, inciden- tally, was from the firm of the Erard Freres, in Paris.) "The twilight was rapidly deepening, and a peculiar sensation stole over the whole company." In this romantic setting this most sensitive musician performed, among other pieces, the first movement of Beethoven's "Moonlight" Sonata. As a prelude to her inti- mate salon concert, however, she performed the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto.l0 Franz Liszt used the Andante con moto for the same purpose. His daughter, Cosima Wagner, in her diary entry for 4 September 1872, reports a private party hosted by Frau von Meyend (with Richard Wagner as one of the guests), on which occasion Liszt was in- vited to perform after dinner. As the core of his impromptu concert he played the Chopin pre- ludes. At Cosima's request, he then delivered his Mephisto Waltzer as a finale. To set the mood quietly for this increasingly brilliant sa- lon concert, however, Liszt chose the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Con- certo." I THE LIKELY ORIGIN OF THIS WORK AS A CONCEPTION FOR SOLO PIANO The hypothesis that this concerto movement originated as a composition for solo piano be- comes more persuasive when the instrument on which the piece is performed has the precise technical features of the instrument on which it would have been composed. This organo- logical concern is the touchstone to the larger musicological problem. A salient feature of such an instrument is that the distinction between the normal sound of the instrument and the una corda sound is remarkably clear. As a re- sult, the instrument can deliver the effect of two distinct voices. At the turn of the century, Beethoven was already feeling frustrated by the limitations of the Classical, five-octave Viennese fortepiano and was in search of a new instrument. The word had obviously gotten out, for in Novem- ber 1802 the composer wrote to his friend Nikolaus Zmeskall that all the piano makers in the city were vying to make a new instru- ment for him that would meet his require- ments.'2 Beethoven mentions only two such requirements, but these are suggestive. First, he wanted a piano veneered in mahogony, one that would immediately have the new look of an instrument in the Empire style. His other requirement was that his new piano must have an una corda pedal. As an extension of this specification, Beethoven would also have had in mind that the new instrument should be triple-stringed throughout, and thus be much larger than the instruments known in Vienna at that time. Perhaps Beethoven, even in 1802, had envisioned some specific use for the una corda sound. On triple-stringed fortepianos of the era-both originals and modern copies- this special effect can certainly be magically evocative. What contact could Beethoven have had be- fore 1802 with an instrument equipped with a true una corda pedal is an interesting question. In April or May of 1800, he had heard the inter- nationally celebrated charlatan Daniel Steibelt 1oSebastian Hensel, The Mendelssohn Family, 1729-1847 (New York, 1882), II, 119-20. "Cosima Wagner's Diaries, Vol. I, 1868-1877, ed. Martin Gregor-Dellin and Dietrich Mack, trans. Geoffrey Skelton (New York, 1978), p. 532. 12The Letters of Beethoven, ed. and trans. Emily Anderson (New York, 1961), letter no. 66, I, 82-83. 34</page><page sequence="5">perform in Vienna.'3 Steibelt was famous-in- deed infamous-for his gimmicky use of spe- cial sound effects on the fortepiano, and to this end he performed only on English instruments.14 In addition, when Haydn returned from Lon- don to Vienna in 1795 he brought with him a fortepiano by Longwood and Broderip. Aside from the identity of the builder, we know noth- ing about this instrument. Most likely it was a triple-stringed grand piano with an una corda pedal. Whatever it was, we can readily assume that Haydn would have invited his young friend Beethoven to try it out. H. C. Robbins Landon states that this Haydn-owned English piano "was admired by Beethoven."'5 As regards the letter of November 1802 in which Beethoven provided his two specifica- tions for a new piano, by intriguing coinci- dence, in August 1803 the composer received the gift of a new fortepiano from the Parisian piano manufacturer Erard Freres.16 This French instrument, one may note at once, had a mahogony veneer. (Had word of Beethoven's specifications, one wonders, somehow made its way to Paris?) Far more important, this state- of-the-art Erard was the first piano Beethoven ever owned that had a damper pedal-and noth- ing could have been more influential on his later piano music than this. This piano also had an expanded range: now five-and-a-half oc- taves extending up to c3. The first piece Beethoven created that required this expanded range was his "Waldstein" Sonata, composed in 1803-04. Most important for our present concern, how- ever, Beethoven's new Erard instrument was triple-stringed from top to bottom, and along with that stringing there came an una corda pedal. Unlike Viennese pianos, Beethoven's new piano, which had an English action, could pro- duce an absolutely true una corda sound. So precise was this technological refinement that the innovative instrument could even report the fine distinctions in timbre between the ham- mer striking una corda, due corde, and tre corde-as in mm. 55-56 and 60-61 of the sec- ond movement of the Fourth Piano Concerto.'7 The truly exciting potential of an instrument of this sort is that, with skillful control of the action-shifting pedal, between una corda and tre corde, one could draw out the contrasting effect of two distinct voices. This possibility was an invitation to dialogue. And Beethoven's fascination with the emotional dynamic of a musical dialogue was a hallmark of his style, most particularly in the years 1794-1808.18 In connection with my hypothesis that the Andante con moto of the Fourth Piano Con- certo originated as a composition for solo pi- ano, I can point out that this work, in this form, can be performed "to a t" on the piano Beethoven received from Erard in 1803. Exactly when the piece was composed we shall prob- ably never know, but it could have been com- posed already in the fall of that year-which is to say, three full years before the concerto was completed and sent off to its publisher, in July of 1806. This hypothosis of a piano composition seem- ingly inspired by the newest advances in in- strument making in the years 1802-03 finds a OWEN JANDER Orpheus Revisited '3Thayer, Life of Beethoven, p. 257. 14In the Leipzig Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung for 26 February 1800, a report of Steibelt's visit to Dresden de- scribes this musician's artistry in considerable detail, with this remark: "Um dergleichen Dinge fertig zu exekutiren, spielt er nur auf englischen Fortepiano's" (cols. 399-400). '5H. C. Robbins Landon, Haydn: A Documentary Study (New York, 1981), p. 116. Robbins Landon provides no documentation for this remark. Back in the 1970s Robbins Landon came on a Longwood and Broderip piano in Vienna and purchased it, on the assumption that it was very likely the instrument that had been owned by Haydn. See also Helen R. Hollis, The Musical Instruments of Haydn (Wash- ington, D.C., 1977), p. 21. '6This instrument is now in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. See the Katalogue der Sammlung Alter Musikinstrumente, I. Teil: Saiten- klaviere (Vienna, 1966), pp. 35-36. 'In his music for the pianoforte, Beethoven only rarely specified the shift from una corda to tre corde, or tutte le corde. Only in these two brief passages does he specify due corde as a stage between these two sounds. No Viennese piano ever built was able to make so fussy a distinction. Given Beethoven's long history of excitement regarding new things that he could achieve when provided with a new instrument with new sounds, we can only conclude that this Orpheus-in-Hades composition sprang from his fascination with the possibilities of his new Erard piano. He could, in effect, do with artistry what Steibelt had done only at the level of charlatanry. '8See my "The Origin of the Beethoven Dialogue," Early Music (forthcoming). In this study I point out that Beethoven's first clear venture into the realm of musical dialogue occurs in the finale of his G-Major Piano Trio, op. 1, no. 2, which probably dates from 1794. 35</page><page sequence="6">19TH CENTURY musicI parallel in Beethoven's "Kreutzer" Sonata for piano and violin, composed during the same two years. That work also features a dialogue that has everything to do with new effects that can be expressed in violin music, thanks to the latest technical inventions-in this case, the modern Tourte bow.19 Here again we encoun- ter an ingenious dialogue inspired by Beethoven's keen sensitivity to the newly im- proved instrument. How pervasive was this line of thought for Beethoven during these years? Turn back the clock and try to imagine the Eroica Symphony without the Inventionshorn-that new sort of horn, perfected at the turn of the nineteenth century, which could now, within seconds, shift from the E6 overtone series to the series in F (as required in the tonally disrupted recapitulation of the first movement). Without the Inventions- horn, the Eroica Symphony would have been unperformable in 1804. The very conception of this symphony, I submit, went hand-in-hand with Beethoven's excitement over the things that could be invented for an Inventionshorn. The "Kreutzer" Sonata, in the world of the violin, had earlier demonstrated this Beet- hovenian connection between the inventions of the instrument makers of his time and his own spirit of creativity. His "Orpheus-in- Hades" composition, in the world of the fortepiano, was one more example of this line of thought in these very years. In sum, we observe this chronologically focused pattern: 1. In 1802-03, the Tourte bow-and the "Kreutzer" Sonata. 2. Shortly after, the fortepiano with an una corda pedal-and the Orpheus-in-Hades dia- logue. 3. 1804, the Inventionshorn-and the Eroica Symphony. BEETHOVEN WORKING FROM KANNE? OR KANNE FROM BEETHOVEN? In my 1985 article, I reported the striking rela- tionship between the libretto that the libret- tist-composer Friedrich August Kanne wrote for his Orpheus, eine grosse Oper in zwey Aufziigen (Vienna, 1807), and Beethoven's An- dante con moto (first performed in 1807), in which many lines from the libretto of Kanne's first-act finale fit Beethoven's music in a most uncanny way. I remarked then that "we cannot know what communication occurred between Beethoven and Kanne on the subject of Orpheus" (p. 200). This intriguing topic de- mands further probing. Kanne, we are told, was one of Beethoven's very few "Du-Freunde," which suggests that these two men communicated in an altogether relaxed manner. Another Beethoven "Du- Freund" from the years 1798-99 had been the violinist Karl Amenda. So close was the rela- tionship between Beethoven and Amenda that the composer presented his friend with per- forming parts for the first version of his F- Major String Quartet, op. 18, no. 1. On that occasion, in June 1799, Beethoven performed the Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato for his cherished Amenda and asked him what he thought it meant. "The parting of two lovers," was the reply, at which point Beethoven re- vealed the inspiration of this "tender and im- passioned" piece of music.20 Beethoven and Kanne were introduced to one another in December 1804, by which time, I surmise, the Orpheus-in-Hades movement of the Fourth Piano Concerto already existed in what I hypothesize to be its original version for solo piano. Did Beethoven, I wonder, similarly play this piece of music for this new friend? Did he similarly ask Kanne what he thought this piano composition was meant to express? In this teasing conversation-of-the-imagination, the next step could well have been Beethoven's revelation that the music had been inspired by the scene in Hades in the Orpheus legend. I find it hard to imagine that the libretto of Kanne's Orpheus already existed in 1804 and served as a point of departure for a composition by Beethoven. On the other hand, I find it easy to imagine that Kanne, who was a most oppor- tunistic fellow, took the opening thirty-eight measures of Beethoven's musical dialogue and 19See my "The 'Kreutzer' Sonata as Dialogue," Early Mu- sic 16 (1988), 34-49. 20Thayer, Life of Beethoven, p. 261. 36</page><page sequence="7">texted it, phrase by phrase and gesture by ges- ture. Kanne could then have used this sequence of lines, derived from Beethoven's composition, and inflated it in his own operatic score. (The manuscript of that score, incidentally, is pre- served in the Music Division of the Austrian State Library. It shows Kanne's scene of Orpheus confronting the Furies of Hades to be as prolix and pompous as Beethoven's is concise and compelling.) I submit, then, that Beethoven did not work from Kanne; the borrowing can only have been in the other direction. HISTORICALLY INFORMED ANALYSIS, STUDY ONE: THE FINAL MEASURE There exist musical moments the analysis of which is incomplete without reference to his- tory. No better example exists than m. 72 of the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, the exquisite and eloquent last measure in this musical drama (ex. 1). Objec- tively described-stripped of all extramusical association-what we find here is an arpeggiated six-note tonic chord, pianissimo, spread out in wide intervals over more than three octaves. An appoggiatura appears on the second degree of the scale under a fermata and resolves to the first degree-all this with the fortepiano's damper rail elevated. Example 1: Beethoven, Fourth Piano Concerto, Andante con moto, m. 72. Joseph Kerman tells us that E. M. Forster, in his Abinger Harvest, characterizes the ending of the Andante con moto of the Fourth Piano Concerto as an outpouring of "true love." One honors Forster's devotion to the music of Beethoven, but it must be admitted that he is no music historian. Nonetheless, Kerman en- dorses Forster's personal notion about "true love" and calls it "a true insight."21 I invite the reader to ponder the other possibility, earlier advanced in my own scenario, that this utterly unique final measure is Beethoven's transla- tion into music of Ovid's image: "And [Orpheus] stretched out his arms, eager to clasp her or to feel her clasp. Unhappy one, he clasped noth- ing but the yielding air."22 That Ovid's image can affect the performance of this final mea- sure can be heard in Melvyn Tan's heartrending delivery, wherein Beethoven's appoggiatura- cum-fermata is held on until the last dying of the note.23 What we encounter here is hardly a musical expression of "true love." This final measure depicts Orpheus's poignant loss of his true love. This situation recalls a remark from Sulzer's Allgemeine Theorie der sch6nen Kiinste, where, in his article "Ende," he points out that "the end is the key to the entire [conception]" (das Ende ist der Schlissel zum Ganzen).24 I submit a corollary: if we neglect to come to grips with history, we deny ourselves the opportunity of detecting how Beethoven's final gesture serves as the key to his entire conception. Sulzer's rule has wide application in the music of Beethoven, right up to the last measures of this composer's final string quartet. HISTORICALLY INFORMED ANALYSIS, STUDY TWO: PHRASEOLOGY In the analysis of music, no element is of greater importance than the phrase, not only in its harmonic shape, but also in its simple length. In this regard, no study is more fascinating than the opening thirty-eight measures of the Andante con moto-where, again, history in- forms analysis. To appreciate Beethoven's think- ing here, we need to understand his debt to the most famous scene in eighteenth-century op- era: the Infernal Scene in the Calzabigi-Gluck Orfeo ed Euridice.

Example 2: Gluck, Orfeo ed Euridice, Infernal Scene, entrance of chorus (New Gluck Edition, I/i, pp. 57-58). Calzabigi structures the familiar encounter be- tween Orpheus and the Furies of Hades on strictly poetic principles. The three stanzas of Calzabigi's ardent speech for Orpheus are all quatrains, each stanza ending with a seven- syllable line on the same rhyme: Il mio barbaro dolor. Lo sento in mezzo al cor. Cosa sia languir d'amor! Although remotely placed, these rhyming lines effectively deliver the essence of Orpheus's speech. In contrast, the formal quatrains of the song-god are enframed by wild outcries from the Furies of Hades, outcries that repeatedly involve stanzas of five lines: the altogether un- orthodox poetic quintain. In Calzabigi's poetic plan, the Furies' open- ing outcry is only the first of a long sequence of these bizarre poetic stanzas: Chi mai dell'Erebo Fra le caligini Sull'orme d'Erole E di Piritibo Conduce il pit? Example 2 shows how Gluck, in octaves, forte, sets Calzabigi's poetic quintain. "Tr6s marqu6" is Gluck's marking in his published French score. Example 3 shows how Beethoven, again in octaves, forte, reinvents the Calzabigi-Gluck quintain phrase, telescoping it into a terse at- tack, in just five measures. "Sempre staccato" is Beethoven's marking. Even as the Calzabigi-Gluck Orpheus had constantly spoken in quatrains, so when Beethoven's Orpheus figure enters, "molto cantabile," he also speaks in calm Classical 38</page><page sequence="9">f sempre stacc.

In Beethoven's ensuing dialogue, these two conflicting ap- proaches to the musical phrase attack one an- other with a vengeance, in quest of resolution. The resulting telescoping of the phrase is graphed in fig. 1. In the Infernal Scene from Orfeo ed Euridice, the obsession with the poetic quintain achieves its culmination in music that is a singular trib- ute to the genius of Gluck. Here is the final stanza for the Chorus of Furies: Le porte stridano Su' neri cardini E il passo lascino Sicuro e libero Al vincitor! As Gluck sets this quintain to music, the lines for the soprano and bass produce a wedge that expands (ex. 5). When the final stanza is re- peated, the musical wedge is reversed, and con- tracts (ex. 6). Following this, the narrowing wedge is re-created in terms of dynamics. "Calando al pianissimo," writes Gluck (ex. 7). In 1774 this was surely the most ingeniously set up decrescendo in the history of music. Small wonder that Gluck's Infernal Scene be- came the most famous scene in eighteenth- century opera. Nor was the dramatic effect of Gluck's "calando al pianissimo" lost on Beethoven; see mm. 35-47 of the Andante con moto.25 25There is a pertinent error in my 1985 article that wants correction. On p. 198 I remark that Beethoven owned a copy of the score to Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. This seems not to have been the case. What I had in mind was an entry in the inventory of Beethoven's estate, on p. 1061 of Appendix C in Thayer-Forbes: "Orpheus und Eurydice is , salable"-with no mention of the composer of this "sal- able" work. Because in 1827 only one Orpheus opera with a German text-Naumann's version-had been published, the score owned by Beethoven has to have been this. The matter is important as it bears on plate 1 in my article, a page reproduced from the Naumann score. This passage already presents a telescoping of the Orpheus-and-the-Fu- ries interchange of the sort that later was to be so bril- liantly treated in Beethoven's composition, based on this same scene. 39</page><page sequence="10">19TH CENTURY MUSIC Allegro Le por-te stri - da-no su' - ne - ri car - di - ni; eil pas-so la - sci-no si- cu-roe li - be-ro al vin-ci - tor, Le porte stri - da-no su'-neri car - dini; eil passo la - sci-no si- curoe li - bero al vinci - tor, Le por - te stri - da-no su' - ne - ri car - di-ni; eil pas - so la - sci-fno si - cu - ro e li - be-ro al vin - ci - tor, Example 5: Gluck, Orfeo ed Euridice, Infernal Scene, from the chorus's final quintain (New Gluck Edition, I/1, pp. 84-85).

In most cases, I dare say, the question is unan- swerable and in many cases unimportant. One recalls, however, Czerny's remark that "in many of his finest compositions Beethoven was in- spired by visions either drawn from his read- ing, or created by his own excited imagina- tion."26 In cases of this sort we would do well to enquire which of the several movements- of a sonata, string quartet, symphony, or con- certo-was the first to be thus inspired? In the answer to that question comes the revelation of the "generative" movement. With the "Kreutzer" Sonata the situation is absolutely clear. The finale was composed in 1802, and the first and second movements were composed in the following year, to serve as antecedents to that finale. As I have explained elsewhere, the finale of the "Kreutzer" Sonata "was the source of inspiration for, and the be- getter of, the first two movements."27 Simi- larly, Lewis Lockwood's exhaustive studies of the sketches of the Eroica Symphony make it clear that the generative movement was again the finale. Lockwood's chapter "The Earliest Sketches for the Eroica Symphony" concludes with the wondrous conviction "In the end was the beginning."28 In the case of the Fourth Pi- ano Concerto, in intriguing contrast with these two well-documented cases, I suspect that the generative movement was the second. This gen- eration had to do with the story. ECHOES OF THE CALZABIGI-GLUCK QUINTAIN AS A CLUE TO BEETHOVEN'S CYCLIC VISION Given the now almost universally accepted idea that this second movement has at least some- thing to do with the story of Orpheus in Hades, what of the enframing movements? Czerny, speaking of the finale of the Fourth Piano Con- certo, says that it was composed "in order to complete the picturesque design, which is also the case in many of Beethoven's works."29 Czerny's remark suggests that he was possessed of some personal awareness-granted to him by Beethoven, presumably-that the whole of the concerto was governed by some single "de- sign." In other words, Czerny implies that this concerto is a cyclic conception, and a "pictur- esque" one at that. The present essay is an inadequate occasion on which to pursue all the details of this enor- mous musicological problem, but the reader might be interested to learn about a couple of teasing associations. A fascination with Gluck's brilliant musical treatment of Calzabigi's recur- ring poetic quintains plays an important role in the overall scheme of the Fourth Piano Con- certo. This fascination asserts itself at the launching of not just the second movement but also the enframing first and third movements. The Orpheus myth is ever and again in his- tory set forth in three episodes: the Song of Orpheus (during which Orpheus amazes all of Nature); the particularly beloved story of Orpheus in Hades (Beethoven's second move- ment); and then the grisly tale of Orpheus torn limb from limb by the vengeful Bacchantes. The first movement (the Song of Orpheus). Ovid reports that, before Orpheus launches his song, he quietly tests the strings of his lyre, which were "of many pitches."30 Beethoven responds to these words by softly leading into his concerto with a hushed, introspective phrase for the solo piano. This phrase launches with an eight-note chord-as Ovid says, a thing of "many pitches"-and Czerny instructs us that this many-pitched chord should be softly arpeggiated (ex. 8).31 This hushed, introspective phrase is five measures long. The third movement (Orpheus and the Bac- chantes). The Bacchantes, who have been out- raged by Orpheus's denigration of them, spy the musician-god out in a meadow "fitting songs to the striking of the strings of his lyre." (The OWEN JANDER Orpheus Revisited 26See Czerny, Proper Performance (facs.), p. 60. 27See my "'Kreutzer' Sonata," p. 36. 28Lewis Lockwood, Beethoven: Studies in the Creative Pro- cess (Cambridge, Mass., 1992), p. 150. 29Czemy, Proper Performance (facs.), p. 111. 30"And when he had tried the strings by strumming them with his thumb, and his ears told him that, although these were of many pitches, they were in tune, he raised his voice in song" (Ovid, Metamorphoses, bk.

"Look!" one of them says, "Look! there is the man who scorns us!"32 The hushed opening phrase of Beethoven's finale carries an immediate sense of agitation. At the end it also brings a distinct suggestion of menace (ex. 9).33 This phrase is ten measures long. (Five double measures, actually.) Here, then, we have a three-movement work in which each movement begins with a phrase in five-certainly a unique situation. Not to be forgotten is the point of origin for all this: Calzabigi's verse for the Furies who repel Orpheus in poetic quintains, together with Gluck's inspired musical response to that verse. As a first clue to what Czerny calls Beethoven's "picturesque design" there can be nothing more substantial than this. THE VIENNA GESELLSCHAFT EDITION OF OVID'S Metamorphoses (1791) Here are some other clues-and these are in- deed "picturesque." My Orpheus article ex- 32"While with such songs the bard of Thrace [Orpheus] drew the trees, held beasts enthralled, and constrained stones to follow him, behold, the crazed women of the Cicones [the Bacchantes], with skins flung over their breasts, saw Orpheus from a hill-top, fitting songs to the striking of the strings of his lyre. Then one of these, her tresses streaming in the gentle breeze, cried out, 'Look! Look! There is the man who scorns us!"' (Ovid, Metamor- phose, bk. XI, lines 1-7). 33"Menace?" a skeptical reader asks? That reader should consult Ovid, Metamorphoses, bk. XI, lines 1-43, with its unbridled bloodthirsty account of the Bacchantes' annihi- lation of Orpheus. This whole frenzied affair, of course, is a typically Ovidian spoof. What is important is its effect on Beethoven. The finale of the Fourth Piano Concerto is the most violent-entertainingly violent-invention in the history of the concerto. The movement is unperformable on a Classical, five-octave Viennese fortepiano, and con- ceivable only with the new resources of the then "mod- ern" instrument. Regarding this opening phrase, another detail of inter- est, one commented on in every published analysis is that Beethoven's finale is in G major, but his hushed, agitated opening phrase lurches down onto G major from the "el- evation" of C major-just as Ovid's Bacchantes hurl them- selves on Orpheus from the hillside above. 42</page><page sequence="13">plained the singular importance of the three- volume edition of Ovid's Metamorphoses (in German translation) published in Vienna in 1791-by interesting coincidence, the year be- fore Beethoven moved to the city. This mile- stone publication, financed through elaborate patronage, was the first edition of Ovid's monu- mental mythography that had ever been per- mitted by Vienna's extremely conservative cen- sors. This Gesellschaft edition was fitted out with 140 illustrations pirated from a luxurious Paris edition of Ovid published between 1767 and 1771. One of these illustrations, which in the Viennese edition is captioned "Eurydice wird dem Orpheus wieder entrissen" (Euridice is again torn away from Orpheus), was repro- duced in my earlier article (p. 203). This care- fully thought-out illustration depicts three plot events encountered in Ovid (and Virgil), each of which is reflected in Beethoven's music: 1. the sudden frenzy with which Orpheus breaks his vow and turns to look back at Euridice (mm. 55-56); 2. the three fateful crashes that are heard in the swamps of Avernis (mm. 56-59); 3. and the abruptness with which Euridice is pulled back and vanishes afar (mm. 60-64). The Gesellschaft edition also contains two il- lustrations that concern the opening events of the "Song of Orpheus" and "Orpheus and the Bacchantes" chapters. Both of these illustra- tions are likewise intriguingly suggestive of spe- cific details in Beethoven's score. The Song of Orpheus. Plate 1 is captioned "Orpheus zieht durch sein Saitenspiel Thiere, Felsen, und Baiime an sich" ([With his perform- ing on the strings of his lyre] Orpheus draws to himself beasts, rocks, and trees). The dreamy figure of Orpheus strumming on his lyre finds its parallel in mm. 1-5 of the first movement of the concerto. At the very sound of the Orphic lyre, Ovid tells us, all Nature is amazed.34 This amazed response is expressed by the eighteenth- Q. In At O r'5 ,;C _ OW ~ c 0K. tii ilk 2* gq m XM lot?

Beethoven's depiction of Nature's response to this initial experience of the magical sound of the Orphic lyre occurs in the pianissimo entrance of the strings at m. 6. The pianist's opening phrase had moved from the tonic (G) to the dominant (D). Now, in response, the strings enter on the strangely remote chord of B major. With the surprising lift of the dominant chord root D to D# in the next harmony, we encounter a uniquely enchanting expression of 43 OWEN JANDER Orpheus Revisited 34Such is Ovid's own enchantment with the idea of the magical effect of the sound of the Orphic lyre, that he names twenty-seven species of plant and vine that in- stantly respond to this magical sound by uprooting them- selves in order to get closer to Orpheus as he sings his song (Metamorphoses, bk. X, lines 88-105).</page><page sequence="14">19TH CENTURY MUSIC the idea of amazement-even though Schen- kerians will hasten to point out that this is nothing more than a simple cross relation. Orpheus and the Bacchantes (the finale). The second movement of the concerto had been scored for strings only. The first thirty-two mea- sures of the finale are also scored for strings only-but to what purpose?, we wonder. Here the Bacchantes, in their first attempt to destroy Orpheus, hurl their leaf-entwined spears at the Song-God (mm. 21-24), but, since Orpheus is protected by the magical sound of his lyre (mm. 25-28), the spears merely bounce off35 (mm. 29-31). Beethoven, I hasten to add, is not de- picting these events; he is merely writing mu- sic the unusual character of which is suggested by them. This distinction is important. Realizing that Orpheus cannot be harmed so long as he is protected by his music, the Bac- chantes determine to drown out the magical sound of his lyre. They hurl themselves on him, screaming and howling and playing "wind instruments, brass instruments, and drums" (tibia, cornu, timpanaque).36 The fortissimo blast from the full orchestra at m. 32-at which point the trumpets and the timpani make their first appearance in the entire concerto!-is incon- testably inspired by this line of the Classical text. The plate 2 caption is "Orpheus wird von dem Bachantinnen zerrissen" (Orpheus is torn to pieces by the Bacchantes). How aptly Czerny described Beethoven's "design" for his Fourth Piano Concerto as "picturesque!" EDWARD T. CONE'S PROVOCATIVE DEMUR In the same issue of this journal presenting my first thoughts about this problem, Cone pro- vided a commentary: "Beethoven's Orpheus- or Jander's?" Cone's contribution is of singular value for its inclusion of his own insightful technical analysis of the Andante con moto. In this analysis, Cone conscientiously seeks to think in terms of traditional abstract music theory, but goes on to add: "A certain amount of anthropomorphism has adulterated the above description, for in the interests of concision I a"J4 say 9 Plate 2: Orpheus is torn to pieces by the Bacchantes. have combined two steps: a rudimentary har- monic outline, and its possible programmatic interpretation. In so doing I hope I have made clear why I prefer reading the entire movement as a depiction of the single scene of Orpheus's encounter with the Furies."37 For all his com- mitment to "abstract" musical analysis, Cone could not have dealt with this piece of music without an "adultering" anthropomorphism, given the obviously rhetorical nature of Beethoven's inspiration. In his opening paragraph, Cone describes my article as "provocatively fascinating as an imagi- 3SIbid., bk.

At the same time, how- ever, he assumes that "it is likely to arouse strenuous opposition." The only strenuous ob- jection I am aware of in the past ten years, however, is this one by Cone. His chief com- plaint has to do with the series of events as- signed to mm. 47-72 in my "program": "Find- ing no single poetic source that seems to fit the direction of the music, [Jander] concocts one by juxtaposing lines from Ovid and Virgil, some- times out of their original order. Even so, his version moves from Orpheus's confrontation with the Furies directly to his homeward jour- ney with Euridice, drastically telescoping the action."38 I take firm issue with this criticism- not to quibble defensively, but to establish cer- tain parameters for the future investigation of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto. What troubles Cone here, obviously, is that in Beethoven's version of the Hades chapter of the Orpheus myth there is no scene in which Orpheus pleads with Pluto and Persephone for the release of Euridice. Also missing is the other familiar scene in which, as the two lovers make their way through the gloom of the Under- world, Euridice pleads with Orpheus to turn around and give her a reassuring look. Treatments of the Orpheus myth through- out history-and these are countless-forever find authors working from one or more earlier models, drawing some ideas from these sources, adding new material of their own, and in gen- eral rearranging detail to serve some new pur- pose. Virgil drew on traditions regarding the Orpheus legend that were age-old. Ovid worked from Virgil, but went off in a host of new direc- tions. For example, the scene in which Orpheus pleads with Pluto and Persephone does not figure in Virgil at all; this is Ovid's invention- and an elaborate invention it is, going on, char- acteristically, for twenty-five lines.39 In the world of opera, the version by Monteverdi (1607) finds Orpheus pleading with neither the Furies nor Pluto and Persephone, but with the boatman Charon (act III). This version does have a scene for Pluto and Persephone, but in this scene Orpheus is ab- sent. It is especially noteworthy in the Monte- verdi opera that we now encounter a scene (also in act III) in which Euridice pleads with Orpheus to turn around and look at her-and thus to break his vow. Nothing of this latter sort occurs in either Virgil or Ovid, where Orpheus's decision to break that fatal vow is his alone. This particular scene is invented pretty much whole cloth by the composer and his librettist, with the patent goal of giving the soprano something to sing. In Virgil and Ovid, Euridice is all but mute. The libretto for the Gluck version (1762) is indebted to both Virgil and Ovid, but again makes all sorts of changes. With the power of Orphic song having been dramatically demon- strated in the Infernal Scene, there is no need for any later scene involving Pluto and Persephone. Indeed, these two characters never figure in Calzabigi's libretto at all. On the other hand, Calzabigi and Gluck pull out all the stops in the un-Ovidian scene where Euridice per- suades Orpheus to turn around and look at her. This particular scene was harshly criticized by C. F. Cramer, in his Magazin der Musik in 1786, since Euridice's success in getting Orpheus to break his vow turns her into a very ordinary woman ("eine ganz gew6hnliche Frauen- zimmer"), and, even worse, turns the heroic Orpheus into a pathetic henpecked husband.40 ("They both deserve what they get," adds Cramer; "our sympathy is transformed into de- rision.") Cramer missed the important fact that this scene functions to provide Gluck's soprano with some enthrallingly expressive music. Johann Gottlieb Naumann's Orpheus opera (1786) is based on Gluck's, but it also has some notable inventions. This version of the story solves the problem of the henpecked husband by getting rid of the whole subplot of Orpheus's vow. Now the kindhearted Persephone simply causes the two lovers to be safely and securely reunited. The Naumann opera features a couple of temple scenes, which had a great vogue in opera at the time (recall Mozart's Zauberfl6te). Most fascinating, Naumann's version of the story includes a couple of scenes that feature a OWEN JANDER Orpheus Revisited 38Ibid., p. 283. 39Ovid, Metamorphose, bk. X, lines 14-39. 40See my "Orpheus in Hades," pp. 198-99, with concomi- tant notes. 45</page><page sequence="16">19TH CENTURY MUSIC tribe of Bacchantes who, at the end, stab Orpheus to death-although he is then brought back to life by the High Priest, in another pre- figuration of Die Zauberfl6te.41 The Kanne Orpheus (Vienna, 1807) gives the story a number of inventive spins, several of which I discussed in detail in my original ar- ticle. Kanne's solution to the problem of the henpecked Orpheus is again to omit the prob- lematical scene. Then, at the beginning of act II, he invents a major scene in which it is Euridice, not Orpheus, who melts the hearts of Pluto and Persephone with an elaborate emo- tional appeal. This is probably the most ambi- tious scene for the soprano Euridice in any Orpheus opera. Cone's criticism about my program "drasti- cally telescoping the action" thus raises the question: the action in which version of the Orpheus legend? What I find so ingenious, and so admirable, about Beethoven's concerto move- ment is that here we encounter the most con- cise, logical, and gripping flow of familiar events in any treatment of the Orpheus-in-Hades story. In mm. 47-72, I ask, is the "juxtaposing" of events from Virgil and Ovid the result of my "concoction," or is it simply one more example of the age-old practice of reinventing the Orpheus legend? To my mind, these deft juxta- positions should be credited only to Beethoven. All the foregoing will strike some readers as an exercise in musicological overkill-but here is its real importance. Between 1792 (when he moved to Vienna) and 1804 (when he began work on his Leonore) one of Beethoven's goals was to establish himself as a composer of op- era, and to this end he studied new scores with zeal-among these the scores of operas having to do with the favorite tragic stories about Romeo and Juliet, and Orpheus and Euridice. What is remarkable is that these particular stud- ies on the part of Beethoven bore fruit as they inspired instrumental works: first a string quar- tet movement, next a piece for piano solo... and then an entire concerto. THE ORPHEUS-IN-HADES STORY AS IT HAS INFLUENCED RECENT PERFORMANCES OF THE ANDANTE CON MOTO OF THE FOURTH PIANO CONCERTO: TEMPO AND TEMPI In the past ten years it has been interesting to observe the evolution of the performance of the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto. As a result of my 1985 article, a number of authors of program notes for various American orchestras have called the attention of their readers to the speculative Orpheus-in- Hades "program"-appropriately repeating my own caveat that this "Jander-program" can never be proved. ("What if it can't be proved," one of these writers remarked to me, "I still find it persuasive.") More important, several conductors and pianists have likewise been gripped by that program and now perform the concerto movement with new vitality. (The first to do so were Leon Botstein and Richard Wilson, as early as fall 1985.) Regarding the performance of this movement, Carl Czerny, in 1849, admonished, "It must not be played too slow."42 This remark sug- gests that the problem of a too-slow perfor- mance, which has plagued this piece for gen- erations, already existed 150 years ago. Despite the marking "Andante con moto," which liter- ally means "moving along with motion," many nineteenth- and twentieth-century conductors and pianists have been determined to turn the piece into a slow movement.43 How an awareness of this music's specific dramatic content helps in the correction of the historical problem of too-slow performance has been demonstrated repeatedly. In the 1987 per- formance by Christopher Hogwood and Steven Lubin, this Andante con moto lasts 4:34; whereas in the 1989 performance by Roger Norrington and Melvyn Tan,44 the timing is 4:06. Compare these with recordings from the days of 78 rpm records and LPs, when it was 41Haydn's Orpheus opera, L'anima del filosofo (1791) also introduces a chorus of Bacchantes, very likely on the model of the Naumann opera, five years before. 42See Czerny, Proper Performance, p. 110. 43Regarding the manner in which the understanding of the meaning of Andante slowed down during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, see Neal Zaslaw, "Mozart's Tempo Conventions," in International Musicological So- ciety Congress (Copenhagen 1972), pp. 720ff. 44L'Oiseau-Lyre 421 408-2; EMI CDC 7 49815 2. 46</page><page sequence="17">not uncommon to find the movement dragged out to six minutes or longer. In a very recent recording of the Fourth Pi- ano Concerto, issued in 1994-with Sir Charles Makerras conducting the English Chamber Or- chestra and Mikhail Kazakevich playing the piano-the second movement times at 4:19.45 This recording, albeit done with modern in- struments, is of extraordinary historical impor- tance and interest. It includes Beethoven's more than thirty revisions of the op. 58 that are en- countered in MS A82B in the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. These fascinating refinements on the part of the composer are reported in detail in Barry Cooper's 1994 article.46 There can be no question about it, the definitive schol- arly edition of this concerto must give prefer- ence to these refinements. The text of the op. 58, as we have known it thus far, is based on its published version, dat- ing from 1806. The revisions doubtless came about in the aftermath of Beethoven's two known performances of this concerto in 1807 and 1808. It is interesting to note that the composer's revisions involve only the first and third movements. If Beethoven remained con- tent with the published version of his Andante con moto, I assume that this results from my hypothetical assumption that this movement, by 1806, had already existed for several years.47 Two especially intriguing, recent treatments are encountered in the 1986 recording by Andr6 Previn and Emanuel Ax, which times at 4:59, and the 1988 version by Stephen Simon and Anthony Newman, at 4:33.48 These two perfor- mances are of special interest since in each case the conductor and pianist were obviously aware of Czerny's remark, "It must not be played too slow; though the pianist may re- strain the time rather more than the orches- tra" (my italics).49 In most earlier recordings, the opening or- chestral phrase is performed at such a plodding pace that the pianist's only musicianly response is to pick up the tempo. This exactly reverses the effect recommended by Czerny. (It is worth recalling that Czerny studied this concerto with Beethoven.) In these two historically informed performances just cited, however, when the pia- nist enters at m. 6, the musical phrase-with the "restrained" tempo-comes across as hesi- tant and introspective. At this moment in the story, when Orpheus makes his plea to the Furies, introspection is not what Beethoven had in mind. Performed this way, the arching musi- cal phrase in mm. 6-13 fails to suggest the image of the song-god Orpheus pouring forth his calm but eloquent plea. Here is my own solution to this unusual problem. The basic tempo of this movement should be determined by the opening phrases of the piano, for this is the Song of Orpheus. It is the two phrases in mm. 6-13 and 19-26 that must indeed "move along with motion." In order to contrast with this, the preceding defi- ant outcries from the orchestra, in mm. 1-5 and 14-18, should be delivered at a distinctly faster pace. On that basis, the telescoping phraseology in mm. 1-38 progresses hand-in- hand with a gradual reconciling of the two con- flicting tempi. Orpheus's subduing of the Fu- ries of Hades is most obviously depicted in the protracted decrescendo in mm. 38-47. In prepa- ration for that, however, in mm. 1-38, we have experienced (or should have experienced) Orpheus's masterful restraining of the Furies at the even more basic level of tempo. This particular solution to the problem of Beethoven's uniquely conflicting tempi was demonstrated in an exemplary manner in a per- formance of op. 58 by the conductor Christo- pher Hogwood (with the Boston Handel and Haydn Society) and the pianist Robert Levin, in spring 1994 (first in Boston, then in Milwau- kee). Here the conductor, the pianist, and the musicians in the orchestra were all caught up OWEN JANDER Orpheus Revisited 45Conifer Classics 75605-51237-2. 46Barry Cooper, "Beethoven's Revisions to His Fourth Pi- ano Concerto," in Performing Beethoven, pp. 23-48. 47Cooper ("Beethoven's Revisions") points out that in the manuscript in question, the first and third movements are written in one hand, and the second movement in an- other-again attesting to the fact that the middle move- ment had a life of its own, apart from the outer move- ments. 48RCA Victor 60476-2; Newport Classics, NCD 60081.

Hogwood's tempo for the opening phrase by the Furies was down- right fierce. This agitated tempo then set the stage for Levin, who was at liberty to "restrain the time rather more than the orchestra"-but yet to sing forth, Andante con moto, in a tempo that had everything to do with the compelling power of Orphic song. As a result, the conflict of tempi in this dialogue was played to the hilt. In the Hogwood-Levin performance, the dra- matic scene that inspired Beethoven in the first place led to a musical result that finally hit the mark. J. F. Reichardt, referring to Beethoven's per- formance of the Fourth Piano Concerto on 22 December 1808, described the second move- ment as "a masterpiece of beautiful sustained melody, [which] Beethoven actually sang on his instrument with a deep melancholy which awakened its response in me."50 Levin's perfor- mance of the piano phrases in the first half of the movement (up to m. 46) involved frequent arpeggiations of the chords. This approach in- deed served to "sustain" the melody and greatly added to the quiet urgency of the lyric outpour- ings. The stimulating influence of an awareness of the Orphic content in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto most recently, in March 1995, resulted in a remarkable and engaging concert conceived by Karl Middleman, director of the Philadelphia Classical Symphony, with Andrew Willis as the fortepianist. In the Andante con moto, Willis's use of chord arpeggiation was even more rhapsodic than had been Levin's, leaving one convinced that without such treat- ment these piano phrases become altogether bland and unpersuasive.51 In Middleman's in- ventive program, the Fourth Piano Concerto was the concluding event of the concert. Before the intermission, the concerto had been pre- ceded by the "Infernal Scene" from Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, followed by the final scenes of Haydn's rarely performed L'Anima del filosofo, ossia Orfeo ed Euridice. The audience thus approached Beethoven's concerto informed and enticed by earlier musi- cal depictions of the Orpheus story. The pro- gram booklet included reproductions of the three relevant illustrations of the story, drawn from the 1791 Viennese edition of Ovid's Metamor- phoses. An introductory talk, with passages per- formed by the musicians, explained to the audi- ence the many ways that these visual images find direct translation into Beethoven's music. For the first time in history an audience experi- enced Beethoven's op. 58 as his "Orpheus" Con- certo. The result was electrifying! JOSEPH KERMAN'S "NOTES ON A BEETHOVEN CONCERTO" Since 1985 the one notable addition to the lit- erature regarding this Andante con moto has been Kerman's 1992 essay. (This article, Pro- fessor Kerman informs me, was inspired by my own of seven years earlier.) Kerman's intention is not to shoot down any of my material; in- stead, he, like Cone, sets out to provide an alternative approach. Kerman starts out by pon- dering the historical ambivalence surrounding the use of "emotive or anthropomorphic lan- guage" in the analysis of music. He cites the writings of Donald F. Tovey-whom he right- fully admires52-as the classic example of this approach and then points out what we all know full well: that in the decades following the Sec- ond World War there occurred a strong reaction to this subjective approach, resulting in a pe- riod of determined positivism. Finally Kerman comments on the latest trend: "The use of such language and the tacit acknowledgment of its importance is also becoming more and more common in recent academic music criticism."53 In this regard Kerman singles out the writings s0Source Readings in Music History, ed. Oliver Strunk (New York, 1950), p. 738. 51A similar situation pertains with the very opening mo- ment of the entire concerto. If that eight-pitch sonority is performed as a block chord, as in the published score, it has little magic. If quietly arpeggiated, as suggested by Czerny, this introductory event instantly acquires new meaning, since it evokes the sound of the Orphic lyre. 52Kerman, "Tovey's Beethoven," Beethoven Studies 2, ed.

Kerman seeks to create an exegesis of the Andante con moto that will pick up on the venerable merits of Tovey's approach, and- o'er-leaping the rather arid approach of the posi- tivists-still be of interest to the most respected intellectuals of our time.54 As a point of depar- ture, he endorses Cone's choice to read "the entire movement as a depiction of the single scene of Orpheus's encounter with the Furies." In order to achieve this, Kerman steers clear of all my historical references to Gluck, Naumann, and Kanne. Above all, he remains silent about the sequence of events I had detected as being inspired by events in Virgil and Ovid, but which Cone had found so disturbing. In Kerman's ar- ticle two things disappoint. Although his ex- egesis is beautifully written, from the stand- point of the nitty gritty of musical detail he advances nothing new. Even more disappoint- ing, he produces no new historical informa- tion, no insights drawn from the world of Beethoven. The nineteenth-century scholar who had the most important insights into "the deeper ideas" in Beethoven's instrumental music was Adolph Bernhard Marx, whom Beethoven himself called "that gifted Herr Marx," a scholar able "to re- veal more and more what is noble and true in the sphere of art."55 "Tiefern Ideen" were Marx's own words regarding the goal of his Beethoven studies. Marx expressed his route toward achiev- ing that goal in a homely couplet: Wer den Dichter will verstehn, Muss in Dichterns Lande gehn. (Whoever seeks to understand the poet Must journey in the poet's world.) Marx's rule still applies. CONCLUSION When we set out to place calipers to the extramusical ideas that fired Beethoven's imagi- nation, we must not only journey in Beethoven's world, but also be prepared in that journey to exercise our own imagination and to speculate. This adventure was never better described than by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whose Sherlock Holmes explained: "It is the scientific use of imagination, by which we have always some material basis on which to start our specula- tions."56 In the further exploration of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, specula- tion will of course be required. At each and every stage, that speculation must be governed by what we know about the world in which Beethoven lived, what we know about those forces that could have stimulated his imagina- tion. As Marx tells us, the only reliable route for this enterprise is the path of history-as determinedly narrowed, and as carefully rea- soned as we can make it. In the past ten years, in the wake of my original article, I have become aware of several teachers who now use that article and Cone's response-and now Kerman's article-in their Beethoven courses for undergraduates. These teachers start out by having their students ana- lyze the Andante con moto along abstract lines. Only when that important first exercise has been accomplished do they assign the three readings. The ensuing classroom discussions, I am told, are most lively. These youngsters of the new generation are being encouraged to think along lines that would have been anathematic in music educa- tion when I was an undergraduate in the 1940s- and even more anathematic when I was a gradu- ate student in the 1950s! What blocked teach- ers in that generation, of course, was the preju- dicial twentieth-century reluctance to discuss extramusical thought in Beethoven's instrumen- tal music, "the deeper ideas," according to Marx. The most effective way to break that d block is with history. 0 OWEN JANDER Orpheus Revisited 54The most determinedly positivist approach to the analy- sis of this movement, incidentally, is found in Klaus K6rner, "Formen musikalische Aussage im zweiten Satz des G- Dur Konzertes von Beethoven," Beethoven-Jahrbuch, 2nd ser., 9 (1973-77), 201-16. 55Anderson, Letters of Beethoven, letter no. 1403, III, 1222- 23. Kerman, however, in The Beethoven Quartets ([New York, 1966], p. 36), dismisses Marx as an "old commenta- tor.
