      <p>When the now-famous statue of Oliver Cromwell was erected outside Whitehall in November 1899 it stood unassumingly just across from the west wall of St. Margaret's Church. There, a bust of Charles I, erected a few decades earlier, appeared to gaze on the Lord Protector. The two monuments stood as reminders that since the seventeenth century Charles I and Oliver Cromwell had been made by poets, statesmen, and polemicists to coexist, and even converse, in death. They had been featured in pamphlets and poems, in sermons and treatises, and also in folklore; and when they “spoke” to or about each other, they did so as dead men whose relationship derived from beyond the grave. This pattern was supplemented by a series of occurrences that over the next two centuries encouraged many people in literature and politics to imagine the two men in continuous juxtaposition: their bodies had suffered physical violence, and their supporters had depicted them as triumphant in the afterlife. Both men had been memorialized in royal chapels, and both graves had at one point been lost. By 1899 neither man enjoyed a lavish tomb or figural monument. The tomb of Charles I was marked by a simple slab in the floor of St. George's Chapel, Windsor. Cromwell's burial place, long emptied of its occupant, was marked by a plaque in the floor of the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The quiet commemoration of the burial sites was deceptive. Since their respective deaths, the language of historical memory had been employed with great fervor to keep the King and the Lord Protector talking to and about each other. The cooperation of the genres of literature, history, and folklore produced a comprehensive fantasist view of the relationship between Charles I and Oliver Cromwell that resulted in a unique effect: the corpses of the two men became texts, and were objects through which their relationship could be read and understood.</p>
      <p>History, literature, and legend form an interesting partnership. Inevitably they intrude on one another. When they do, the boundaries that separate them expand to form a liminal area, which hosts a unique type of intellectual energy. This intellectual energy is characterized by its ability to read events, places, persons, and even objects as texts in and of themselves. This kind of reading has been demonstrated by Jonathan Gil Harris in <italic>Untimely Matter in the Time of Shakespeare</italic>, in which the author engages with objects rather than subjects;<sup>1</sup> and by Bruce Smith in <italic>The Key of Green: Passion and Perception in Renaissance Culture</italic>, in which the color green is the “thing” with which the author engages.<sup>2</sup> Reading objects in this way changes how we look at connections among history, literature, and material culture. It becomes possible to have a comprehensive discussion of a phenomenon with a material object at the center, from which literary and historiographic text proceeds. Such a discussion treats the object itself as text, rather than something that is described by text. Rather, text is inscribed onto the object. Here, the corpse is the “thing” around which understanding revolves and onto which text is inscribed. This idea is evident in Susan Zimmerman's important book <italic>The Early Modern Corpse and Shakespeare's Theatre</italic>.<sup>3</sup> “Reading the corpse” in this way affects the literature of historical memory because it allows the corpse to be a part of that memory as a text in and of itself. It makes the corpse different from an anthropomorphic art object, such as a sculpture or painting. A sculpture or painting describes the human body. A corpse <italic>is</italic> a human body. It stands as a discrete object that describes itself even as it is described. The secondary literature that explicates the text of the corpse is therefore not limited to any one type. The comprehensive rhetoric of the corpse cooperates with and incorporates literary studies of death and memorial, such as epitaphs and commemorative poems, the history of burials and disinterments, and stories of ghosts and legendary sites.</p>
      <p>Many scholars and politicians of the nineteenth century viewed the Civil Wars with fascination and nostalgia. As Blair Worden, Roger Howell, and H. F. McMains have demonstrated, there was an attraction to the discourse of the seventeenth century in the wake of the military triumphs of the early part of the nineteenth century, and amid the growing power of the Labor movement in Parliament in the latter half of that century; they cite the work of Thomas Carlyle and Edward Clarendon (among others), who saw the seventeenth century as an archetypal time that reflected on contemporary issues and concerns.<sup>4</sup> Such politicians and scholars expanded the rhetoric of the Civil Wars by creating new political and historical texts to replace the ghost pamphlets, commemorative epitaphs, and broadsheet ballads of the seventeenth century. Still, Charles I and Oliver Cromwell were sensationalized in imaginative ways, just as they had been in the earlier texts. Those speeches, histories, and biographies did not displace the discourse of the dead, which continued in the protected liminal space formed by the partnership of history and legend. Charles I and Oliver Cromwell continued to “speak” to each other through their respective supporters, whose efforts cooperated with popular legend.</p>
      <p>A comparison of the seventeenth-century view to the nineteenth-century view is therefore important, because it shows that the connection between written text, oral text, and material text concerning the human corpse as a central or principal object, changes over time, but does not diminish over time. The presence of material text allows the literature of historical memory to renew itself and re-engage with the past as people observe, experience, and remember objects. It continues the expression of an effort, which had manifested in the seventeenth century, to re-envision both Oliver Cromwell and Charles I not as living men, but as dead men in mutual engagement. It produces innovative literary and political views of each man's dead body, and it invigorates folk legends by placing the corpse of each man at the center of historic sites, landmarks, and monuments. Historical memory in the nineteenth century is therefore profoundly affected by the enduring presence of the corpse as a readable element, which recalls the past and speaks to the present.</p>
      <p>Charles I had died a most dramatic death, as a deposed king suffering execution at the hands of revolutionaries—indeed, he had given the signal for the axman with his own hand. There was a large crowd, many of whom cheered the death of a man they saw as a tyrant, and many others who cried out against the death of a man they saw as a martyr. No one, of course, disputed that the King was dead. That had been perfectly evident—or at least it should have been. After the execution, the severed head of Charles I was sewn onto the body so that the King could be viewed as he lay in state. As Clarendon would later say, “His body was immediately carried into a room at Whitehall; where he was exposed for many days to the public view, that all men might know that he was not alive. And he was embalmed, and put in a coffin, and so carried to St James's where he likewise remained several days.”<sup>5</sup> The situation, however, immediately lent itself to rumors. One story, which by the beginning of the nineteenth century had become legendary, holds that before this posthumous re-memberment took place, Cromwell had inspected the body himself for assurance that the deed had been done, and done correctly. The story reflects concerns held by the regicides and their supporters that the King's body would remain formidable in death as he lay in state. Because the King's subjects would be able to see his body intact, their memories would be permitted to preserve the image of the King's “whole” body. Despite the fact that the admirers of Charles I had accepted his death, there was a risk that they would adopt the belief that the King was being interred as a “whole man.” Such a belief would be tantalizingly mythic, and dangerously accessible to Royalists. It was therefore necessary to deprive the King's supporters (some of whom were suspected of having Catholic sentiments) from being able to make any sort of pilgrimage to the tomb to pray for or to the dead king and establish communication with him in death as a martyr figure, or access the corpse for the collection of relics. Although the veneration of relics had been banned during the reign of Henry VIII, the tradition continued and was often politicized: after the execution of King Charles many of his supporters dipped their handkerchiefs in his blood. It was still believed in many quarters that relics were objects of communication between the martyr and the devotee, under the auspices of Divine Will, texts constructed from the remnants of the martyr's corpse. In the light of these issues, the story of Cromwell's inspection acknowledged that even in a decapitated state the King could speak volumes, and that the republic needed to be protected from this voice. The King's body was therefore taken away from London by a small group of lords, to Windsor, and interred at the Chapel of St. George with a great deal of secrecy and discretion.<sup>6</sup> This action pleased Parliament, for it promoted security, as Windsor was a military fortification behind locked gates. Although the King's entire (albeit not <italic>whole</italic>) body was interred there, no one would be able to access it. In a further effort to combat any power wielded by the dead king, Parliament's denial of Charles's burial in the Chapel of Henry VII interrupted the dynastic continuity of the Tudors and Stuarts. Neither the King's whole body nor the Stuarts' whole dynasty could remain intact.<sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The occasion of Cromwell's death on a stormy night nearly ten years later was fraught with rumors that the Lord Protector was not really dead. He was in Ireland, in hiding perhaps, or abroad. Much of this disbelief was a reaction to Cromwell's death by natural causes, and by the view that his death had been premature. But a large part of it can be attributed to the fact that Cromwell's body was buried quickly in Westminster Abbey, secured behind a wall and adjacent to the tomb of Henry VII.<sup>8</sup> Interestingly, there was a desire for security similar to that which was behind the securing of the body of Charles I. There was a fear of relic hunting, or worse, of disinterment for the purposes of revenge. Placing Cromwell adjacent to the tomb of Henry VII also secured Cromwell's legacy in a place among the very kings whose dynasty he had interrupted. The body of Cromwell took the place of that of Charles I, lying in its stead among the Tudors and Stuarts.<sup>9</sup> There was also a practical concern. Cromwell had planned his funeral years earlier, devising a grand pageant based on the funeral of James I in 1625.<sup>10</sup> Because the planning and implementation of the funeral took months, the funeral had to rely on effigies for lying in state and for the procession and funerary rite. By the time of Cromwell's public funeral his body had rested in Westminster, unseen and essentially uncommemorated, for over two months. In that sense, the <italic>whole</italic> body of Cromwell was no more present at his funeral in 1658 than the King's had been at his own burial in 1649. Rumors spread that the Lord Protector was not dead at all.</p>
      <p>These rumors disturbed Andrew Marvell, who held a deep admiration for Cromwell. Marvell did not wish for any suggestions of myth or ritualism to attend upon Cromwell's death. In “A Poem upon the Death of His Late Highness the Lord Protector” Marvell sought to emphasize the fact that the Lord Protector was not only definitively dead, but was better off that way. In the poem, Marvell states boldly the fact of the matter: “I saw him dead.”<sup>11</sup> This statement is in part an assertion of Marvell's Parliamentarian authority. As a Member of Parliament, Marvell had the privilege of seeing Cromwell's corpse up close, unlike the majority of London's populace, who had to wait months for the funeral only to see him in effigy. He therefore had an exclusive claim, which could be supported by his reputation as an MP and as a loyal servant of the Protectorate. Unaffected by superstition or rumor, Marvell held a detached yet pious view of death. He saw himself as a most reliable witness to the fact that the man was dead. Marvell had seen Cromwell in the simplicity of death, by viewing his body laid out plainly. For the poet this was an appropriate appearance for Cromwell. At the funeral, Cromwell's effigy had been dressed in royal robes, and adorned with a scepter and a crown. Marvell was distressed by this depiction, and in his poem he resists the sentimentality that he knew accompanied such ritualism, and which he believed to be linked strongly to Royalism. Indeed, Marvell felt that the funeral and its use of effigy threatened to “crown” Cromwell posthumously. If such an effort were to succeed, it would result only in a resurrection of the monarchical body of Charles I. It would, in fact, argue in favor of one of the defining elements of monarchy—that the King had a mystical connection to God and therefore ruled by Divine Right.<sup>12</sup> In such a case, although his physical body was dead, Charles I would continue to live, mystically, in the bodies of Oliver, and then Richard Cromwell—indeed, in the body politic of the Protectorate itself. The King would thereby intrude, continuously, on the Protectorate, and speak through it. As Ashley Marshall points out in his analysis of “A Poem upon the Death of His Late Highness the Lord Protector,” Marvell abhors this idea and uses his poem to emphasize that Cromwell's body is a <italic>dead</italic> body, without a voice.<sup>13</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Marvell especially describes the decayed state of the corpse, saying that death has reduced the great man to a state less than human: “That port which so majestic was and strong, / Loose and deprived of vigour, stretched along: / All withered, all discoloured, pale and wan— / How much another thing, nor more that man?”<sup>14</sup> But this is not a regrettable state. It means that not only Cromwell but also kingship is dead. By placing himself in the same room with the corpse, and by deemphasizing any sense of pomp or adornment of the body, Marvell is, according to Marshall, attempting to “reabsorb Cromwell into the known patterns of human experience,” in effect disenfranchising the concept of “the King's two bodies” completely.<sup>15</sup> Marvell asserts in his poem that although Cromwell does not have a mystical, monarchical connection to God, he will live again, albeit spiritually rather than physically. Marvell writes, “Yet dwelt that greatness in his shape decayed, / That still though dead, greater than death he laid: / And in his altered face you something feign / That threatens death he yet will live again.”<sup>16</sup> In de-mystifying monarchy, Marvell both humanizes Cromwell and associates him with the Elect, thereby making his poem an act of devout iconoclasm. As Marshall says, “In short, Marvell's poem emphasizes the absence of a king. There is no king because there had been no king.”<sup>17</sup> Cromwell's body must be inspected just as the King's has, and he must be as dead as the King is.</p>
      <p>Almost immediately after Cromwell's death, pamphlets appeared that sought to establish a posthumous conversant relationship between the Lord Protector and the King. In them, the ghosts of Cromwell and Charles I engage in rhetorical combat as they struggle for primacy from beyond the grave. There was a well-established tradition of these “ghost pamphlets,” which used the parlay of the dead to continue the unfinished business of earthly polemic. Highly imaginative, they used what Joad Raymond calls “a patchwork of widely accessible forms, including prose, verse dialogue, and dramatic dialogue, to combine humour, criticism, and revenge fantasy, and to reveal diabolical machinations occluded from the sight or understanding of the living.”<sup>18</sup> The ghost pamphlets sought to fill the gaps of information left by incompletely or poorly reported news during times of crisis, and presented themselves as testaments to historical and cultural memory. Beginning during the later years of the Reformation, ghost pamphlets and broadside ballads featuring ghosts appealed to readers (and hearers) who were looking for ways to justify confusing, threatening, or otherwise unstable events in their changing world. During the Elizabethan era, ghost pamphlets could be used for continued attacks on a dead enemy: Thomas Nash, for example, appears after his death in several ghost pamphlets, such as <italic>Leicester's Ghost</italic> (1584) and <italic>Crop-Eare Curried</italic> (1644); in the latter he confesses to the deficiencies of intellect and personality that his enemies had claimed all along.<sup>19</sup> Robert Greene appears posthumously as well, in pamphlets such as <italic>Greenes Newes Both from Heaven and Hell</italic> (1593) and <italic>Greene in Conceit, New Raised from His Grave</italic> (1598); in the latter piece Greene condemns the art of pamphleteering and the war of words it has caused.<sup>20</sup> Ghost pamphlets acted as enhancements and accompaniments to polemical tracts, often referring to political pamphlets and their authors. As late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century pamphlets argued in general for certainty and justice amid controversy, ghost pamphlets added to these print conversations by compensating for the inconveniently absent voices of the dead. The ghost pamphleteer uses the figure of the ghost to provide a sense of rightness that, for circumstantial reasons, cannot be reproduced by the voices of the living. As Raymond points out in his discussion of pamphleteering during the Stuart period, living people have sensibilities and opinions, and arguments and matters of consequence can sway them. The dead, however, have no pretenses in this respect. They speak the truth in ways living witnesses cannot, because living witnesses cannot provide evidence of God's judgment. Since the dead have experienced God's judgment, they do not merely speak the truth, they are embodiments of the truth. Even as they demand justice, they represent God's justice.<sup>21</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The ghost of Charles I appears in pamphlets soon after his death, and most place the King in heaven, asserting his martyrdom and condemning the Protectorate. One pamphlet, however, takes an interesting approach—it nods at traditionalism while it describes a contemporary issue. <italic>A Coffin for King Charles</italic> (1649)<sup>22</sup> was published anonymously as a polemical ballad and was meant to be sung to the tune of a popular song.<sup>23</sup> In the ballad, a living Cromwell sings triumphantly from a throne, as a usurper whose republican rhetoric has been set aside in favor of a desire to be king. In response, Charles I sings from his coffin in the crypt of St. George's Chapel. Compellingly, Charles I sings not as a ghost per se, but as a revenant figure, a living dead man lying in his coffin, and protesting the injustice of his death. He cries out to Cromwell, “Think thou base slave, though in my grave / Like other men I lie: / My sparkling fame and Royal name / Can (as thou wishest) die[?]”<sup>24</sup> Cromwell dismisses the voice from the grave, proclaiming the King to be dead “without all remedie,”<sup>25</sup> but the dead king asserts his right, by way of his physical and mystical body, even in death, stating that soon his son will inhabit the monarchical body and restore the Crown.<sup>26</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Although the King states that he is in heaven, and singing among angels,<sup>27</sup> he also sings from his coffin, as an animated corpse. His body and soul are separated, yet both are reunified via his consciousness. Much like the revenant of medieval exempla, who returns from the grave to warn others of impending danger or to identify his murderer, Charles I defends himself from his tomb in the name of justice.<sup>28</sup> He does not, however, appeal for prayers for his soul, as revenants in the exempla tradition often do—although the anonymous author imagines the king to be a hagiographic figure, he does not openly promote Catholicism. Still, the headless king speaks as a whole man, even in death, and therefore recalls another early tradition of martyr saints who are termed <italic>cephalophoric</italic>—namely, saints who speak or sing after they have been beheaded.<sup>29</sup> As he sings in his grave, Charles I empowers and modernizes the cephalophoric tradition, which is characterized by St. Edmund the martyr and Saint Denis, among others.<sup>30</sup> These figures defy, via Divine Will, the most dramatic act of silencing: the severing of the head from the body. Here, the hagiographic tradition is acknowledged, but is defined by the Church of England via the body, specifically via the singing head of the king. The king is both ghost and saint, an embodiment of both traditionalism and Protestantism, and his body is at once severed but whole.</p>
      <p>Upon his death Cromwell appeared in ghost pamphlets as well. In many of them Cromwell speaks from hell, often as a rival to the Devil. Even when he is not speaking from Hell he is an aggressive, haughty figure who is eager to perturb the Stuarts, and in particular the dead king. In <italic>A New Conference Between the Ghosts of King Charles and Oliver Cromwell</italic> (1659), the two men again speak to each other in death.<sup>31</sup> Still eager for power, the upstart ghost of Cromwell returns to England and disturbs the peaceful rest of the dead king as he lies in his tomb:

         <italic>A New Conference</italic> backs away from conventional ideas of liminal space that had accompanied the medieval ghost tradition for centuries. Typically, either ghosts haunt places—most commonly the places of their deaths or burials—or they haunt the living, visiting humans in moments of solitude or emotional vulnerability. In <italic>A New Conference</italic> the two men haunt each other instead of haunting a physical location or another person or party. Interestingly, neither figure inhabits the Christian afterlife. Although in some pamphlets Cromwell is depicted in hell as a rival to the Devil,<sup>33</sup> and in others Charles I is depicted in heaven among angels,<sup>34</sup> in <italic>A New Conference</italic> the earthly (or un-earthly) location of their conversation is less important than the conversation itself.</p>
      <p>On January 26–30, 1661, the nightmare of Cromwell's supporters came true. Cromwell was disinterred, and his body desecrated and hanged at Tyburn. Cromwell's corpse, along with those of Bradshaw and Ireton, lay among other members of the Cromwell family, whose graves had to be disturbed in order to get to the bodies of the regicides. Jonathan Fitzgibbons theorizes that Parliament was aware that the juxtaposition of the Cromwell family vault to that of the Tudors and Stuarts represented a dynastic rivalry.<sup>35</sup> This indeed appears to be the case. As Sgt. James Norfolke and his attendants disturbed the Cromwells in order to get to their patriarch, the men engaged in a similar type of dynastic interruption as had the regicides when they buried Cromwell among the ancestors and predecessors of Charles I. Once the men located the coffin, which was hidden in the wall and protected with several layers of wood and lead, they laid it out in the open. On the coffin was affixed a gilt copper plate naming Cromwell as Protector of England, Ireland, and Scotland, along with the arms of England, and Cromwell's own family arms.<sup>36</sup> Crowds of Cromwell's supporters, enemies, and those who were just plain curious filed by to see the corpse, paying sixpence apiece.<sup>37</sup> It was far from the dignified “inspection” Marvell had encouraged, although it put to rest the rumors that Cromwell had escaped the hand of death—or justice. The body, along with those of the other two regicides, was dragged to Tyburn and hung at the gallows for more gawking crowds. After a time Cromwell's body was cut down, decapitated, and buried under the gallows in a pit dug for that purpose. His head was placed on a pike above Westminster Hall in a final act that was meant to parallel the death of the King.</p>
      <p>Epitaphs by ghost pamphleteers and polemicists described the posthumous relationship between the King and the Lord Protector in the shadow of the disinterment of the regicides. As Scott Newstok points out in his book on epitaphs in early modern England, epitaphs are more than the literature in the graveyard; they are the literature <italic>of</italic> the graveyard.<sup>38</sup> The audience of this literature extends beyond the readership of those looking on the tomb. It includes the dead as witnesses to the verses that describe them. Moreover, since epitaphs are sometimes written in the first person, from the point of view of the deceased, epitaphs also function as voices of the dead. Although epitaphs had been in use for millennia, Newstok points out that during the early modern period epitaph writing was elevated to an art form in an unprecedented way. Early modern epitaph writers (whether they wrote them for public view or for private circulation) sought to engage in a conversation with the dead in order to reconstruct, and, in a sense, recuperate English history.<sup>39</sup> Newstok argues that epitaph writers of the early modern period were profoundly affected by events such as the Royal Supremacy, the Reformation, the creative explosion and prosperity of the Elizabethan era, the plague, the Great Fire, and—per my discussion here—the Civil Wars. They did more than continue the tradition of a classical genre; they reinvented it.<sup>40</sup> My argument concerning epitaphs (both in ghost pamphlets and in other works) agrees with Newstok and goes a step further: as epitaph writers sought to reconstruct fragments of their history, they also sought to reconstruct communication with the dead. This effort is a reaction to the changes in ecclesiastical policy of the sixteenth century, which had banned Purgatory, pilgrimage, intercessory prayer, and ritual observations. Without such means of communication, the dead are effectively cut off from human experience. In cultivating the art of epitaph writing, Protestant polemicists of the early modern era sought to reestablish this communication in the years following these changes. In doing so, they created a liminal space defined by the epitaph, in which the living and the dead could speak to each other without ritual aids.</p>
      <p>Ghost pamphleteers of the seventeenth century are particularly aware of this fact, using their skills to communicate with (and via) the dead, and to reconstruct history. The Royalist author of <italic>A New Meeting of the Ghosts at Tyburn</italic> (1660/1661) provides each of the regicides with his own epitaph.<sup>41</sup> Any epitaphs Bradshaw and Ireton had on their graves at Westminster were broken up when they were disinterred; Cromwell's grave had been unmarked for security, and his only epitaph was the descriptive plaque, which had been stolen; in any case it had been unpoetic and plain. Since the graves under the gallows afforded the regicides no tombstones, the author of <italic>A New Meeting</italic> provides epitaphs that he feels are fitting to identify each burial and “mark” each dead man the way a gravestone would. Cromwell's reads, “Here lies that Beast made up of blood / That murdered Charles the First so good: /And for his deeds, as they were evill, / Let him not want fire, good Devill.”<sup>42</sup> The “marking” of the figure of Cromwell is an act of revenge on the deceased that parallels the “marking” of the desecration of his body and functions as a text inscribed on his corpse.</p>
      <p>George Bate is one of the few controversialists who dared sign his name to his work. His book, <italic>The Lives, Actions, and Execution of the Prime Actors, and Principall Contrivers of That Horrid Murder of Our Late Pious and Sacred Soveraigne, King Charles the First</italic> (1661), places itself in the context of burial space, both the King's and Cromwell's.<sup>43</sup> Here, he imagines an epitaph for Cromwell that vandalizes the tomb, even after its tenant has been pulled from it. Knowing that the vault containing Cromwell's body had been concealed from view for security, Bate intends his epitaph to mark the spot, rather than the man, in case the disinterment should succeed in suggesting that Cromwell had never desecrated the Chapel of Henry VII by resting there. He says:
<verse-group>
            <verse-line>Here lies ignominious dust</verse-line>
            <verse-line>Which was the only seat of lust;</verse-line>
            <verse-line>A man and yet a Monster too,</verse-line>
            <verse-line>That did both King and State undo.</verse-line>
            <verse-line>Most people say, this is his doom:</verse-line>
            <verse-line>That here he don't deserve a tomb.<sup>44</sup>
            </verse-line>
         </verse-group>
      </p>
      <p>Part of Scott Newstok's important discussion of epitaphs includes the idea that the epitaph “places” the body, particularly by way of the words “Here lies X.” The words of an epitaph do more than locate the object, or “thing,” which is the body; they announce and describe the body. Further, they demand aural participation from the visitor to the tomb, literally, that he or she “hear” the epitaph.<sup>45</sup> As Newstok points out, early modern epitaph writers mean to describe, locate, and occasionally accuse, as Bate does here. Hearing and pronouncing the epitaph at the location where the body is (or was), allows the visitor to participate in the events of the life, death, and burial of the deceased.<sup>46</sup> Bate wants his reader to know that Cromwell once <italic>lay</italic> here, but no longer <italic>lies</italic> here; he does not deserve a tomb, but he deserves an epitaph that leaves the location marked, yet vandalized.</p>
      <p>Because he is a Royalist, Bate does not end his treatise without providing an epitaph for Charles I. He gives a heartfelt (but unconfirmed) report about the burial of Charles I, saying, “A Gentleman standing at his sad interment, threw this Distick into the Vault: Non Carolus magnus, nec Carolus quintus, Sed Carolus Agnus his Iacet intus.”<sup>47</sup> Bate invites his readers to locate themselves at the sites of both burial and disinterment, engaging in an imaginative reenactment of events they had not attended. Because he supports the King, Bate uses the second epitaph to attest to the injustice of the King's execution by placing the text in immediate proximity to the body. Bate's posthumous epitaph for Cromwell marks the external location of the body with text; the King's epitaph is placed in the coffin, internalizing the relationship between Charles I and the anonymous “Gentleman,” who represents those members of the public who could not be there. Bate's anecdote also attempts to compensate for the tradition of hagiographic adoration that could not take place at the time of the King's actual interment. Hagiographic adoration and incorruptibility were issues that attended the deaths of both men, precisely because the Chapel of Henry VII had been involved. A follower of the cult of Henry VI, Henry VII had at first wanted to be buried at Windsor next to his predecessor, whom he expected to be canonized. His tomb at his own chapel at Westminster had been meant to establish a hagiographic dynasty for his family. It did not go unnoticed that Cromwell had been buried next to Henry VII, while Charles had been buried near Henry VI. It was also apparent to many that after Cromwell's disinterment, the body of the King's nemesis was displayed publicly, with people paying sixpence to see a desiccated corpse instead of making a donation at the tomb of an uncorrupted one.</p>
      <p>John Quarles includes an epitaph for the King in <italic>Reglae Lectum Miserae; or, A Kingly Bed of Misery</italic> (1649).<sup>48</sup> In a dream about the dead king, Quarles goes to kiss the King's hand, but the phantom disappears before Quarles can venerate it. Upon waking, he admits, “And then I found my active fancy play'd / The Politician.”<sup>49</sup> He then proceeds with an elegy, wishing that every heart could spend a few drops of blood on the tomb of the King, so that the tomb would soon be covered with blood from loyal and well-meaning hearts: “And send / Millions of sighes to Heav'n, that may expresse / His death was Englands great unhappinesse.”<sup>50</sup> Here, the blood of aggrieved and penitent Royalists produces sighs, which are heard by heaven. Quarles also recounts that his dream had featured a second funeral for Charles I, one in which the Thames, filled with the tears of loyal subjects, would provide a more fitting conveyance than the earthly river had.<sup>51</sup> Again, an author envisions that the King is reinterred, the funeral reproduced in an imaginative, literary reenactment so that the real body lying in the grave can rest in peace. A reimagined public funeral replaces the secretive first one, and produces, in the mind of the author, a secondary reality. The epitaph at the end of the piece likens this imaginative reinterment to a state of gestation, which will give birth to dynastic continuity and allow Divine Right to pass to the King's son, Charles II. It reads, “I may presume to say, a Tombe / Never had a richer wombe.”<sup>52</sup> The tomb itself is a womb that will nurture kingship during the years of the Interregnum, until kingship is reborn upon the restoration of the monarchy. John Quarles did live to see the Restoration, and he was very likely proud of his prophetic epitaph.</p>
      <p>There were many rumors that ran wild in the aftermath of the disinterment of the regicides, but the with the most staying power claimed that the body which had been dragged out of the Chapel of Henry VII, hanged, and decapitated, was not that of Oliver Cromwell. This rumor (which persists in some quarters today)<sup>53</sup> owes much of its longevity to the fact that it revisited an issue that troubled both Royalists and Roundheads in 1649 and again in 1659: that the great man (either Charles I or Cromwell) was not dead; that he had escaped, and that the body interred (or disinterred), was not his. Even if one had witnessed the posthumous hanging of Cromwell, one might still not be able to say, as Marvell once had, “I saw him dead.” The fantasy that Cromwell's body had been switched fed the imaginations of both camps, and it was used by each to weaken the position of the other for centuries afterward. One facet of the rumor looked to Pepys's diary for legitimacy: Pepys cites that he read “in a French book” a rumor that while he was alive, Cromwell had translated the bodies of many English kings from one place to another; and that it could not be known whether the body hanged at Tyburn “be that of Cromwell or one of the kings.”<sup>54</sup> With this rumor there arose the horrible possibility that the Royalists, in their zealous desire to exact revenge on Cromwell's corpse, accidentally desecrated the body of one of their own kings. Citing the participation of aptly named “resurrection men,” proponents of the switched-body theory could comfort themselves with the idea that Cromwell's body was still safe, enshrined in the Abbey. Interestingly, whether one was a Royalist or a republican one could find solace in such an idea, since it places the bodies of both men, once again, on common ground after death. If the switched-body rumor could be believed, both sides could rest assured that the body of their hero lay unmolested, protected within a sacred space and among kings, hidden from the eyes of all but God. In any case, by 1684 both Cromwell and Charles I lay buried in unknown, unmarked graves.<sup>55</sup>

      <p>During the nineteenth century there was renewed interest in the Civil Wars and their major figures. Just as the Henrician era and the Reformation were being reimagined, and even relived, so was the Interregnum. Nonconformists had taken a continuously positive view of Cromwell throughout the eighteenth century, largely because of his support for religious toleration;<sup>56</sup> but in the nineteenth came the cry, “We need another Oliver.”<sup>57</sup> How one got another Oliver was a complicated matter. In his study of the subject, Roger Howell breaks down what he calls the “extensive recall” of Cromwell into three defining factors: First, reference to Cromwell as a political symbol had already been established in the eighteenth century, not infrequently with radical overtones. He says, “During the Wilkes crisis of 1769, for example, Cromwell's image was used as a threat of deposition or regicide.”<sup>58</sup> Second, the folk memory and oral tradition with respect to Cromwell were strong in the nineteenth century, with a focus on working-class evocations of his image. While not all that tradition was positive, there was a significant association in the popular mind of Cromwell with prosperous, or at least better, times.<sup>59</sup> Third, various issues that agitated nineteenth-century politics had what Howell calls “distinct echoes of the great seventeenth-century struggle” and could easily be fitted to a Cromwellian frame.<sup>60</sup> His forceful foreign policy and the perception that he had made England respected abroad especially cooperated with British Imperialism.</p>
      <p>Cromwell was reestablished as a national hero, in great part by the publication of Thomas Carlyle's <italic>Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</italic>,<sup>61</sup> which defined the English view of Cromwell for nearly a century. Cromwell was lionized as a virtuous, morally upright figure, a man who Jonathan Fitzgibbons claims “was something that most Victorian families could admire.”<sup>62</sup> Ironically, his image was subject to a switching of sorts—from that of a Puritan Lord Protector who committed regicide and brutally repressed the Irish, to a champion of religious sectarianism and the working class, a man who reflected nineteenth-century republican ideals. Just as the monarchical body stood resurrected intact in the body of Victoria, the republican body politic was to be resurrected in a refreshed Cromwellian figure. As Blair Worden states, “If many Victorians were against what Charles had been against, by the middle of the century few people were in favor of what, in political and constitutional matters, he had been for.”<sup>63</sup> This complex but convenient notion allowed Cromwell to stand in close proximity to the monarchical body in political unison. People could respect the authority and tradition of the monarchy while admiring the progressive aspects of republicanism. These issues, says Worden, when combined with a rising admiration for military heroism in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, produced a Cromwell who could stand alongside Wellington and Nelson.<sup>64</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Around the same time as some of England's greatest victories in those wars,<sup>65</sup> the body of Charles I was literally stumbled upon by workers in St. George's Chapel who were cutting a passage leading from under the choir to a new mausoleum. A hole was broken in a brick wall along the passage, and upon inspection, the workers were able to see three coffins. Since one of the coffins was very large, they supposed it to be that of Henry VIII. If that were the case, the coffin next to it would be that of Jane Seymour, and the third would be that of Charles I.<sup>66</sup> The Prince Regent (later George IV) ordered the opening of the vault shortly thereafter. It was done on April 1, 1813, under the auspices of the Prince Regent, the Duke of Cumberland, Count Munster, the Dean of Windsor, Benjamin Charles Stevenson, Esq., and Sir Henry Halford, physician to the King and the Prince Regent. Despite his relapse into mental illness, George III himself was also present. Dr. Halford recorded the event as the coffin was opened, and noted that the only words inscribed on the coffin were “King Charles 1648”—an identifying marker strikingly similar to Cromwell's in its simplicity. The head was loose, its sutures long since having disintegrated, and it was easily removed from the coffin. Upon inspection by all present, it was agreed that the head was definitely that of Charles I. Halford records:
<disp-quote>
            <p>At length, the whole face was disengaged from its covering. The complexion of the skin of it was dark and discoloured. The forehead and temples had lost little or nothing of their muscular substance; the cartilage of the nose was gone; but the left eye, in the first moment of exposure, was open and full, though it vanished almost immediately; and the pointed beard, so characteristic of the period of the reign of King Charles, was perfect. The shape of the face was a long oval; many of the teeth remained; and the left ear, in consequence of the interposition of the unctuous latter between it and the cere-cloth, was found entire.<sup>67</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>With no further disturbance, the coffin was soldered shut. This time no one would forget where the king lay. William IV commissioned a simple monument of black stone, on which was inscribed the names and dates of those buried in the vault.<sup>68</sup> Locating the body of Charles I was a victory for monarchists, because it presented them with an opportunity to reiterate the tragedy of regicide and the failure of the short-lived Protectorate. The identification of Charles I also promoted the idea of monarchical continuity in the face of uncertainty: the Prince Regent reigned in the place of his father, George III, who was mentally ill; as George IV he left no heir, and was succeeded by his brother, William IV, who, leaving no heir, was succeeded by his niece, Victoria. Locating the body, saying, “Here lies Charles I,” argued in favor of dynastic endurance in the face of adversity.</p>
      <p>Giving voices to Cromwell and Charles I allowed both men to speak to the Victorians in the political rhetoric they already understood. This renewed interest also allowed both men to “speak” to Victorians folklorically, through that culture's fascination with ghosts. Much of English ghost legend stems from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with the latter century representing the high point of interest in communication with the dead. Victorians actively pursued proof of life after death, with séances, spirit mediums, and various types of pseudo-scientific ghost investigation.<sup>69</sup> Amid this fervor for ghosts, Charles I and Cromwell were given the opportunity to defend themselves, albeit in language with which the Victorians, rather than the people of the Stuart era, were comfortable. Here, the conversant dead make their pleas directly to the living via hauntings, rather than to each other in pamphlets and ballads. The ghost of Charles I was reported in various places associated with battles and political intrigues of the Civil Wars.<sup>70</sup> He appeared, for example, at Marple Hall, Cheshire, where he was associated with the apparition of a free-floating decapitated head;<sup>71</sup> at Christ Church, Oxford, where he walked the grounds while holding his head under his arm;<sup>72</sup> and at Pencait Castle, Lothian, where his death mask was displayed.<sup>73</sup> He was also seen at Court House in Painswick, where his headless ghost was said to drive around the grounds in a phantom coach.<sup>74</sup> In each case the ghost is headless; this state serves as a continual reminder of the severance of the monarchy from the people, and of the dynastic interruption of the Stuarts. Although the head and body are reunited in the tomb, the king is nevertheless not a <italic>whole</italic> man. The headlessness of the ghost represents conflict, unresolved issues, and dynastic uncertainty. It represents a futility of sorts, as well, since no amount of political reconciliation or cooperation could restore the whole man. It is a frustrating but permanent state, and one with which the Victorians were familiar, since after the 1689 Bill of Rights and the 1707 Acts of Union the monarchical body was forever changed, forever severed from the Royal Prerogative it once enjoyed. The headless ghost of Charles I reflects the vast differences between those who stood firmly on the tradition of monarchy and the authority of Victoria, and those who looked toward republicanism and social reform, for whom Cromwell had become a modern hero.</p>
      <p>The legend of the ghost of Cromwell is related to the switched-body theory that had captivated the English imagination since the seventeenth century. The belief, long held by some, stated that the headless bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw were not thrown into a pit below the gallows at Tyburn, but were buried secretly in a field in Holborn, near a pub called the Red Lion, where their bodies had been held for a few days before their posthumous hanging. By the eighteenth century this field was known as Red Lion Square, and it sported a lone obelisk bearing a mysterious epitaph: <italic>Obtusioris Ingenii Monumentum. Quid me respicis, viator? Vade</italic>.<sup>75</sup> Those who wished to could find great meaning in such an epitaph, and the verse provides much fuel for the imagination. The most inspired of Cromwell's admirers imagined him to be buried under the spot, commemorated cryptically, and safe from the hands of Royalists.</p>
      <p>The ghost legend that grew up around Red Lion Square involves the phantom figures of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw walking about the Square on foggy nights. The three men are conversant, with their heads attached. Their conversation is unheard by human ears but understood by the keen nineteenth-century politico/ghost enthusiast: they speak of the Commonwealth and its best interests. They are hale and hearty, a far cry from the desiccated corpses that were pulled from Westminster. Cromwell's head is where it is supposed to be, his body whole and functional. The imagination that fuels this ghost legend memorializes Cromwell in a different way than does the ghost legend of Charles I: here, the language of cultural memory literally re-members him. It also rewrites the ghost legend of the earlier pamphlets and enfranchises the ghost of Cromwell into the world of the living. The ghosts of the regicides interact with one another as active men of Parliamentary politics, with no acknowledgment of their ghostly state.<sup>76</sup> They act as whole men of the modern world. Conversely, the ghost of Charles I remains connected to the circumstances of his death, and seeks out living witnesses with whom to interact. The Charles I of the Victorian ghost legend is the same Charles of the seventeenth-century ghost pamphlets: restless, and eternally seeking justice. In both cases, however, the two dead figures are placed in the same context of liminal space, and they are identified by the location and state of their respective corpses. As it was, the obelisk in Red Lion Square was probably not the spot where Cromwell's body lay; it is not known what or whom it was meant to commemorate. The monument fell into decay, and was removed by 1790. Cromwell's body, or the idea of its location, went uncommemorated until the mid-nineteenth century, when a plaque was laid in the floor of the Henry VII Chapel (probably in 1866) on the spot where Cromwell's vault had been. It is a simple plaque, inscribed with the name and dates, much like the nineteenth-century stone laid for Charles I at Windsor. By the end of the nineteenth century, both Cromwell and Charles I were located and commemorated, but simply, without monuments or epitaphs.</p>
      <p>Ghost legends of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries cooperate with the monument culture of the later Imperial period. Just as burials locate the body of the dead person, stating, “Here lies X,” tales of hauntings locate the dead <italic>persona</italic> within a specific, memorialized space, which may be different from the locus of interment. Ghost legends announce, “Here <italic>haunts</italic> X.” Monuments perform a similar function in that they locate the <italic>personage</italic> of a celebrated figure, who is most often dead. They present the celebrated figure to his or her admirers in an ideal state of nobility, victory, or youth, pronouncing, “Here <italic>is</italic> X.”<sup>77</sup> Location and presentation were precisely the motives of Lord Rosebery when he proposed in 1894 that a majestic statue of Cromwell be erected at Westminster Hall.<sup>78</sup> The Prime Minister had long been an admirer of Cromwell, whom he had proclaimed to be “the raiser and maintainer of the power of the Empire in England.”<sup>79</sup> Rosebery called for a Cromwell of the Victorian age, one whose persona would be different from that of the seventeenth-century Cromwell but who would nonetheless retain his well-known qualities as a military leader and statesman.<sup>80</sup> Many of Rosebery's fellow politicians, especially the Irish MPs and Tory monarchists, did not hold this view. Despite the favorable reassessment of Cromwell's legacy in nineteenth-century England, and the continuous reiteration of that reassessment in the historiography of the period, the Lord Protector remained controversial.<sup>81</sup> Requests for public funds were therefore dropped, but Rosebery did get his statue in time for the tercentenary of Cromwell's birth, in 1899.</p>
      <p>The statue was not, however, as majestic as Rosebery and other admirers of Cromwell had wanted it to be. Instead of striking a victorious pose on horseback (which Rosebery had wanted so as to recall the 1633 statue of Charles I in Trafalgar Square),<sup>82</sup> the statue of Cromwell stands humbly, the text of his body communicating humility and piety rather than triumph. In one hand he holds a Bible, in the other, a sword, with its blade pointed down. The location of the statue was also less than majestic. In 1882, the new Royal Courts of Justice were opened in the Strand, and the old buildings, which were adjacent to Westminster Hall, were demolished. The demolition site was known as “The Pit,” and although a new stone facade covered the unsightly brick on the exposed wall of Westminster Hall, “The Pit” remained a London joke for some time. By 1899 the overall “pit-like” qualities of the area had been mostly remedied, but it still made for a tongue-in-cheek location for the Cromwell statue. The statue had been erected near the site of Cromwell's disinterment as a form of reconciliation for the act of desecration that had occurred nearby at Westminster Abbey. It located the personage of the great man near the place where his body once enjoyed a king's burial—yet still it “located” the spot where his body was disposed of in a pit. When it debuted, the statue was not granted a dramatic debut before cheering crowds, but was unveiled before a small group of enthusiasts at 7:30 a.m. on November 14, 1899.<sup>83</sup> This was due partly to the political controversy caused by the statue, but it was also due to the fact that Cromwell's desecrated corpse and the pit it lay in were readable texts still contributing to the discourse about the Civil Wars. The disturbing text of Cromwell's disinterred corpse was inscribed on the statue.</p>
      <p>It is perhaps most fitting that a lead bust of Charles I had been installed in the west-facing exterior wall of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster, some years earlier. Set near a plaque commemorating the burial of several of the regicides in St. Margaret's churchyard, the bust looks out on Whitehall and directly (so it seems) across the street at the statue of Cromwell. The expression on the bust is convivial, and yet its gaze (as tour guides are wont to point out) appears to be aiming a triumphant look at Cromwell, who, in deference to the restored monarchy, averts his glance. The disembodied head of Charles I is recalled, and text of the bust as text of the corpse communicates contentment and a sense of justice in death. Via these figural monuments, the two men are “located” on the common ground of both Whitehall and Westminster, where Charles I had reigned and died, and where Cromwell had ruled, been buried, and been disinterred. The “conversation” between Charles I and Oliver Cromwell continues uninterrupted, protected by the liminal space between the world of the living and that of the dead. Both men had intended to complete successful careers at Whitehall and had intended to rest undisturbed at Westminster; both had experienced the interruption of power and the failure of dynasty; and both were removed from the spaces in which they had intended to be defined in life and in death. The statues “locate” this absence and communicate it to onlookers in the form of the commemorated body. Tourists bear witness to both men's bodies as documents of the past and the present: they read them in life and in death, and they “locate” them in absence. Because neither man is buried in that space, a visitor cannot claim, “I saw him dead,” as he or she can within the Abbey church, where a monument locates the dead personage in his or her tomb, uniting commemoration and the physical body. The visitor must therefore say, “I see Cromwell,” or “I see Charles I,” as they read the continuing discourse of the political and monarchical bodies of church and state. Although they are immobile and silent, with neither heads nor crowns, the two men are enduringly and exclusively conversant in death—but still, as it were, not seeing eye to eye.</p>
