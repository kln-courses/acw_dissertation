<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay examines Joe Sacco's graphic strategies for representing the pain of others in his first collected work, Palestine. In particular, I argue that Sacco draws on a kind of "haptic visuality" when representing pain and suf- fering and, in doing so, reformulates standard forms of looking at "the other." Shaking Hands with Other People's Pain: Joe Sacco's Palestine REBECCA SCHERR In mostly ignorance the very in the and beginning U.S., prejudice he of did when the not graphic it question came novel to thinking the Palestine picture about , of Joe Palestinians Palestinians. Sacco recounts as Growing terrorists: his own up ignorance and prejudice when it came to thinking about Palestinians. Growing up mostly in the U.S., he did not question the picture of Palestinians as terrorists: "Terrorism is the bread Palestinians get buttered on, I'd swallowed that ever since air- liners went sky high in the desert, do you remember that, do you remember Munich and the blown up athletes, the bus and airport massacres?" (7). Yet in the present of the text, which takes place over two months in the winter of 1991-92 as the first intifada begins to run out of steam, Sacco finds himself in Israel and Palestine seek- ing to give voice and face to these "terrorists," to rethink his own notions of prejudice and pain, and to convince others to do the same. As Sacco's first sustained graphic work, Palestine represents the beginning of his career drawing in the realm of atroc- ity. Two later texts dealing with atrocity have received wide recognition: Safe Area Mosaic 46/1 0027- 1276-07/01 90 18$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">20 Mosaic 46/1 (March 2013 ) Goraždey which documents a phase in the Bosnian war, and his follow-up to Palestine , Footnotes in Gaza ; yet both of these display a hard-boiled perspective toward the cost of war. It is the author's naïve, eager attitude toward documenting the pain of others that marks Palestine as unique in Sacco's body of work, as a sense of discovery per- meates all nine collected comic books that comprise the volume. In Palestine , Sacco also lays out the stylistic and formal foundations that character- ize all his later works. In Sacco s basic format, the reader follows the character of "Joe Sacco" as he enters a war zone and encounters various people deeply affected by war and atrocity. In terms of the graphic sequences, Sacco moves between his present encoun- ters and others' past experiences. Hillary Chute says of Sacco's work that "it strives to materialize visually an archive of oral testimony [. . .] reconstructing the bodies of oth- ers, bodies that have been ignored by official discourse" (114). But this reconstruction of others' bodies is mediated and complicated by the ways that Sacco reconstructs his own body, transforming himself into a major character. Charles Hatfield calls this auto- biographical tendency "ironic authentication," by which he means a strategy authors use to "reenact or 'speak to'" the making of the work itself. More importantly, the distance that such irony creates both pictorially and cognitively allows for artists to approach "subjects that are almost impossibly hard to handle, where questions of truth and arti- fice are fraught with special urgency, both psychologically and politically" (131). Sacco's works thus fuse documentary and autobiographical methods, dramatizing the tensions between personal revelation and public political and social discourse. Sacco's peculiar visual style, based on the exaggerated and "ugly" aesthetics of the underground comix movement, constantly calls attention to Sacco as artist/creator whether or not Joe Sacco the character is present within the frame; in other words, at first glance the consistent, striking style renders all the sequences ostensibly self- referential, even when the sequences represent the perspectives of others who are recounting their own past suffering. This seemingly contradicts Palestine's purpose of engaging with the rhetoric of testimony and the documentation of human rights vio- lations. Sacco must therefore engage with particular evidentiary strategies in order to communicate the "realness" of the various scenarios he presents. How, then, does the graphic work of a single author/artist present itself as evidence of others' truths? What kind of truth is Sacco dealing in here? What I propose in this essay is that Sacco's form of truth-telling happens in the exchange between reader and text and is based on a kind of emotional and corporeal form of evidence that occurs through a haptic, vis- ceral engagement with the pain of others. While this is not the kind of evidence that can stand in a court of law, it acts as a forceful form of evidence in the court of pub- lic opinion, which has its own power to enact change in the world.</page><page sequence="3">Rebecca Scherr 2 1 Palestine is a political work in that it represents real human suffering that is the result of both local and international politics; at the same time, Sacco's project reveals a deeper politics, a corporeal politics of pain and the circulation of images of pain in an international context. In one of the opening segments, Sacco uses a poignant phrase to encompass what he sets out to do in his project: "But now my buddy on the West Bank wants to make some introductions, to set me up, he wants me to shake hands with his peoples pain" (8). This phrase - to shake hands with other people's pain - is a vivid statement that hints at the intricacies of Sacco s position as witness and to our own position as readers. To shake hands is to greet, to make contact, to enter into a contract or agreement, one that by its unspoken rules connotes fair play. This is not to say that all handshakes signify mutual understanding - sometimes they are simply empty gestures - but in Palestine Sacco seems to use the idea and image of the handshake as a gesture that signifies connection. A few pages after the initial hand- shake, we see an angry Sacco refuse a proffered hand after he has been ripped off by some Palestinian children; a man on the street interprets the refusal: "See! He doesn't want peace!" (24). By and large, then, the handshake in Palestine is a gesture pointing to the willingness to meet the other. On a more basic level, the handshake is a state- ment of corporeality, as touch is a primary bodily sensation. In Palestine , this gesture calls attention to the fact that the comics genre is in many ways as much of a haptic form as it is visual; in order to process the image-text relationship, readers must draw on various sensory and cognitive modalities that render the reading experience as physically intimate. The handshake can thus also be read as a visual metonym for the process of haptic readership. In attending to tactility, Sacco s graphic work engages in what Laura U. Marks calls, albeit within a different context, "haptic visuality," which is "a vision that is not merely cognitive but acknowledges its location in the body" (132). According to Marks, haptic visuality highlights a reader or viewer s involvement in the world of representation, rather than calling attention to the more distancing aspects of visual media (176). The term haptic connotes both literal touching and the realm of feeling and emotion more generally; thus, the term acknowledges that haptic experience need not only be an immediate bodily encounter, but that it can also be a kind of emotional engagement experienced as bodily feeling. In terms of an artistic strategy, haptic visuality can be understood as a connective readerly address incorporating sen- sation and emotion in its communicative reach; it is therefore a strategy that calls par- ticular attention to the role of affect in the encounter between work and audience. Yet while haptics are part of what makes reading the graphic narrative such an emotional and engrossing experience, making it connective, haptics also maintain a</page><page sequence="4">22 Mosaic 46/1 (March 2013) kind of separation. This separation is different from the distancing aspects of visual media I mention above; this kind of separation is one in which the subject recognizes involvement in the world of seeing and feeling while simultaneously recognizing a kind of radical autonomy. For to touch is always, also, to be touched; there is an ele- ment of this exchange that reminds us that we are not the other and the other is not us. Thus a haptic aesthetic highlights connection and separation simultaneously, as "touch is a threshold activity - subjectivity and objectivity come quite close to each other," but they do not become entirely indistinguishable (Stewart 178). Similarly, as the gesture of the handshake can suggest, we can have contact with the other, we can enter into an understanding, but we cannot become the other. For Sacco, this aspect of textual tactility will become important as a way to maintain an ethical stance in the face of looking at, and in a sense touching, other people's pain. For in order to rethink normative notions of looking at this pain, it is important to grant autonomy not only to ourselves, but, even more crucially, to the other. Gillian that has Whitlock the potential writes to that "produce comics an possess imaginative a "unique and ethical vocabulary engagement and grammar" with the that has the potential to "produce an imaginative and ethical engagement with the proximity of the other" (978). One powerful component of Sacco's work that creates this sense of proximity is the way he represents hands. This representational strategy is twofold: it includes, quite literally, Sacco's close attention to human hands; at the same time, the resonant, emotional quality of many graphic memoirs depends on the reader s apprehension of the hands of the author, that is, the trace of the author's pres- ence in every curve and line of the text. Sacco s engagement with hand imagery res- onates strongly with Art Spiegelman's Maus. In Spiegelman's text, the brief use of human hand imagery - especially as it appears in the "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" sequence - calls attention to emotive intensity, in the case of Mausy to the desire to recover what has been personally lost, and the impossibility of doing so (100). Simultaneously, this attention to the emotive quality of hand imagery becomes a reminder of the materiality of the author's body: a trace, a reminder that there is "really" a person who holds, narrates, and feels; a link to life beyond the text. Even a cursory glance at the imagery of Palestine reveals Sacco s close attention to his characters' hands and the role that hands play in expressing emotion: a hand is spread in fright (23), hands grip a machine gun (37), an oversized hand is extended, silently declaring "halt!" (49), hands are held in solidarity (53); these are only a few examples of hand imagery that resonate so powerfully that it seems to leap off the page, indicating not only the image of the hand itself, but, much more to the point, the various affective states that these hands signify. This close scrutiny calls attention</page><page sequence="5">Rebecca Scherr 23 to, in the most direct way possible, the importance of tactility for Sacco's project as a whole. While tactility does not require the touch of hands per se, hands symbolize touch as much as they are instruments for touching. We can think of images of hands as visual metonyms for haptic visuality because the affect of hand imagery depends on both visual apprehension and tactile understanding; our visual apprehension of these hands leads us to feel, on some level, what these hands themselves are depicted as feeling. They move us from purely visual apprehension to a more corporeal realm. Haptic visuality, examined from this angle, is very much about the ways that hap- tic imagery affects a reader. Chute, in her analysis of Alison Bechdels Fun Homey examines the "layers of touch" present in Bechdels text, but keeps her analysis focused on how hand imagery functions within the text, as a form of connection between the artist and her representations.1 What I am suggesting is that such haptic moments also constitute a palpable form of readerly address, where the invocation of the hand can create the conditions for affective forms of reading. Will Eisner suggests such a haptic readerly address when he writes that "body posture and gesture occupy a position of primacy over text. The manner in which these images are employed modifies and defines the intended meaning of the words" (106). Eisner is pointing out that it is in the reader's perception of the gesture that the experience of emotional resonance stands out most poignantly. Thus the sensitivity of the drawn hands holds the power to shape the written component of the text. The affective charge of the bodily image is primary in our apprehension of the narrative, and Sacco depends on the reader s encounter with bodily gesture in order to express the emotional "realness" that is key in persuading us to engage with the pain of others. The gestures of hands seem to be his preferred medium for conveying this. One of the most moving images of hands is that of the elderly mother of one of Sacco s Palestinian informants. We hear from the son about the family's traumatic experience of being attacked by Israeli settlers, who rampaged through their town one evening, smashing peoples' windows with stones. This woman was so frightened by the experience that she developed psychological problems. Sacco draws a panel of the woman next to her stove, broken windows in the background. In the foreground are her oversized hands, drawn so large that they become the focal point of this fairly detailed panel: "She's turning the bread and rearranging the coals with her fingers. . . Christ, she's gotta have some kinda calluses to handle that heat" (66). While the lin- guistic meaning here can certainly be interpreted as a double entendre, it comes across mostly as simple observation. The image of the woman's hands in combination with her facial expression lend the panel its powerfully emotive and disturbing qualities; this is a clear example of how bodily gestures can have primacy over text. This depiction of</page><page sequence="6">24 Mosaic 46/1 (March 2013) the direct touch of hand to coal is a very intense moment signifying sensation itself, of heat and burning, of pain. Yet it also speaks of numbness, of the absence of pain where it should logically be. This comes across most powerfully in the woman's face, which appears impassive in relation to her hands touching the heat. Thus Sacco's image encompasses physical sensation and its connection to psychological suffering. Here, too, we are shaking hands with Palestinian pain, and Sacco is quite literal in his depiction of this, making sure that we as readers clearly understand that the pain he repeatedly rep- resents is not conceptual but is instead immediate, corporeal, as well as psychological. The detailed and expressive presence of hands, however, is only the most obvious signifier of a kind of textual tactility that permeates Palestine. That this graphic novel is entirely drawn by hand, including the accompanying text, is a reminder that the genre's very form calls attention to the labour of the author's hands. Line drawing itself seems to communicate the almost living presence of the artists hands, and therefore has the capacity to communicate something ineffably human and present, imbuing all the drawn content with an intense subjectivity. Jared Gardner writes: "We know the line of the graphiateur is no more 'natural' than are the words of the author and yet the line compels a physical, bodily encounter with an imagined scene of embodied enunciation [ . . . ] the line brings us back to the embodied author whose sig- nature on the page remains as unique and idiosyncratic as an autograph or a voice- print" (66). In other words, the graphic forms tactile quality, as expressed in the line drawing and experienced by the reader on a visceral level as a trace of the artist's pres- ence, continually communicates the subjective and affective dimensions of the con- tent presented. So many affective states are generated merely through our perception of the drawn image and how we perceive that drawn image as referring to a particu- lar body. Especially in the case of graphic memoir, where we attach the line drawing to a specific albeit imagined authorial body, the suffusion of this bodily presence is what constitutes the ground from which we engage viscerally with the content. Through a kind of intimate contact with the author via line drawing, we become a part of the text, or perhaps it's more correct to say the text becomes a part of us. Many scholars of comics and graphic novels follow Scott McCloud's lead in argu- ing that the sense of a reader experiencing him or herself as a part of the text is achieved through the act of closure, referring to the necessary act of using the imagi- nation to connect individual panels, using our full range of sensuousness in order to surmise what happens when we move from panel to gutter to panel again (69). While this is certainly one of the ways that the comics genre frames the reader as a part of the text, the haptic charge of drawing itself represents an even more primary level of reader identification, one that operates within individual panels and across panels as</page><page sequence="7">Rebecca Scherr 25 well. This haptic charge can be considered a dimension of what Thierry Groensteen calls the comics page's "iconic solidarity," which is "the necessary condition so that visual messages [can], in first approximation, be assimilated within a comic" (20, emph. mine). In other words, the haptic charge of line drawing is part of the initial encounter that draws us "into" the page, while closure can be thought of as a secondary action. The imagined hands of the author that suffuse every element of Palestine, in com- bination with the much more literal representations of hands that are scattered across numerous panels, together produce the foundation through which we as readers can access affective, visceral, haptic forms of reading. To paraphrase Walter Benjamin: the traces of the potter's hands are not just all over this text, but the potter s hands consti- tute the text itself, and it is the reader's perception of this that awakens in us an affec- tive engagement with the content. As Benjamin points out, these traces convey far more than mere information; what is told in this manner is passed on "as experience to those listening" (159, emph. mine). Reading the graphic narrative itself is a bodily, res- onant experience, and when the resonant content we are experiencing is other people's pain , pain that is directly attributable to human rights violations, we are framed as a kind of emotionally invested witness to that pain. In Sacco's work, the affective charges his drawings elicit are not simply ends in themselves, but point to the political and eth- ical dimensions of feeling as they manifest in the realms of testimony and spectator- ship. In other words, he takes something that is part of almost all comics work - the haptic charge of line drawing - and channels this charge into particular discourses aimed at waking people up to an affective reality beyond the page itself. The visuality presence on of a formal literal and level, imagined while at hands the same in Palestine time revealing work to a communicate corporeal politics haptic of visuality on a formal level, while at the same time revealing a corporeal politics of pain. In other words, Sacco uses haptic visuality politically and strategically. More specifically, such an aesthetic leads us readers to examine the ethics of representation. Sacco sets up specific scenarios throughout Palestine where he attends quite precisely to difficult questions regarding what it means to look at and feel the pain of others. In doing so, his work provokes questions that probe the ethical dimensions related to the act of haptic looking, such as: do we become voyeurs in reading this text, or does hap- tic viewing entail something more or even other than voyeurism? What is the responsi- bility of the one who looks? In order to raise such questions pictorially and narratively, Sacco engages with a specific discourse or form of imagery that has been and continues to be the most widespread form for communicating human rights violations and depicting the pain of others more generally: the photograph. While Sacco very much engages with the narrative strategies of the literature of human rights,2 the text enacts a</page><page sequence="8">26 Mosaic 46/1 (March 2013) dialogue between its own comics format and photography in both clear and subtle ways, and it is through this dialogue that Palestine touches on the ethics of spectator- ship. My claim is that Sacco's haptic aesthetic works to "touch" images of pain and suffering, and in touching the image, reworking habitual (i.e., photographically medi- ated) forms of looking at the pain of others. Susan Sontag argues that drawn images of atrocity signify a "synthesis" rather than direct evidence of something that actually happened; drawings of suffering claim, according to Sontag, that "things like this happened" (47, emph. Sontag's). This synthesis, this approximation that graphic works indicate through their very form, lends them the weight of evidence of atrocity without the referentiality associated with the photograph. Because of the sense that drawings seem to communicate that something like this happened, the drawn image is not anchored so strongly to a par- ticular moment in time. Its implied temporality floats more freely, unlike the tempo- ral implication of the photograph. The photograph's capturing of a specific moment communicates that something happened in the past, and while photographs of suf- fering might affect a kind of immediate emotional charge in the viewer, it is easy for the viewer to then place this image irrevocably in the past. In their evidentiary role, human rights photographs depend upon being received as transparent documents of suffering, and thus they often do not communicate that same sense of the subjective; it is this seeming objectivity that allows the photographic image to serve as a form of evidence in a court of law. (This is despite the fact that scholars have long problematized the status of photographic evidence, pointing to such issues as the transformative power of photography as well as the narrative and ideological framing of images through captioning.) The intervention of the human hand on the surface of the photograph is rendered purposefully invisible, while, as I argue, the evidentiary power of the drawing entirely depends on making such inter- vention visible. In the context of documenting human rights abuses, both kinds of evidence - the photograph and the drawing - are meant to move us, but in different ways. In fact, all human rights iconography is specifically designed to participate in "an affective economy that transforms others into objects of feeling and sight" (Hesford 57). All too often, however, the feelings produced are those of a kind of sym- pathy that does not question or critique the site of looking itself, and all too often the purpose of such images is precisely to obscure the dynamics of power inherent in such sympathetic modes of looking.3 It is to intervene within this specific "affective economy" that Sacco exploits the uniqueness of the comics format. He fuses and fractures texts and images to create instances in which seeing is transformed into questionable, uncomfortable feelings:</page><page sequence="9">Rebecca Scherr 2 7 states of haptic awareness that in many ways question the efficacy of our sympathies toward the suffering other. Graphic narrative is, in some ways, perfectly poised to address the growing consensus among critics that we need a more nuanced, critical mode for thinking about human rights imagery. One of its strengths is that because it possesses a visceral, resonant dimension, and because it is made up of sequences of panels that give the impression of the movement of time and space, the format can communicate the experience of pain, not just the existence of pain. Photographs, con- versely, are traditionally used to document the existence of suffering. "Moderate Pressure," Saccos famous sequence that depicts the torture inflicted on a Palestinian man named Ghassan (102-13), is an example of the uniqueness of the graphic narrative in its ability to communicate the experience of pain. Ghassan's tor- ture continues day after day; much of the time he is locked in a room, handcuffed to a pole and hooded. As the sequence continues, Saccos frames grow increasingly smaller. Not only does this allow him to increase the number of panels per page, crowding the pages with images that depict deep discomfort, but the use of such a form gives the reader a visceral sensation of something closing in and claustrophobic: thus the framing itself communicates or mimics for the reader, albeit only very slightly and at a certain distance, Ghassan s experience of pain, which translates as a deep discomfort for the reader. Of course, the reader does not experience Ghassans actual pain, but the visceral dimension of this scenario acts as what Sara Ahmed might term a "call of pain," which asks the reader for more than empathy and wit- nessing. Because the specific context of this sequence is torture, it calls for a certain amount of political positioning via the feelings that arise as a result of the encounter with such imagery (32). Such a focus on the importance of haptic experience does not mean that photo- graphic rhetorics are less important in Palestine. Sacco expresses the significance of photography for his whole project by often drawing himself taking photographs; by always, when representing himself as a character, drawing his camera bag at his side even when not taking pictures; and Sacco bases much of his drawing in general on photographs. He has stated that he is mostly photographing when he is collecting sto- ries and statements, taking out his sketchbook "if it's inappropriate to take out a cam- era" (Vâgnes 201). In addition, Sacco's frequent use of perspectivai distortion gives the impression that we are viewing the panels through a kind of photographic lens. Sacco, however, also points out the limitations of the camera, for he understands that one of the graphic narrative s particular powers is its ability to go places the cam- era cannot: "The camera cannot go into the past," he says. Referring to "Moderate Pressure," Sacco says that the camera cannot "go into the room where people are being</page><page sequence="10">28 Mosaic 46/1 (March 2013) tortured" (Vagnes 200). The implication, of course, is that his graphics can evoke these experiences, based on others' testimony. Photography is therefore not the last word when it comes to evidence of human rights abuses. As one of Sacco's informants says before describing in detail his experiences of being tortured, "The door closes, and the world cannot see" (94). This is interesting up against some of the implicit claims of human rights photography. Often the atrocity on view is so extreme that the message seems to be that the viewer is looking upon something meant to be hidden from view, to not be seen, a form of obscenity. Sacco s point is that there are further layers of invisibility where the camera cannot go, but graphic work can evoke the unseen, thus exposing the limitations of photographic evidence. At certain points in Palestine , Sacco goes even further in his critique and indicates that the camera is a potentially dangerous weapon in representing the pain of others. In one chapter, Sacco draws himself and his photographer friend Saburo document- ing a protest in East Jerusalem, and he draws Saburo readying his camera. This cam- era appears oversized and is unmistakably meant to resemble the tear gas gun held in the hands of an Israeli soldier on the bottom right of the same page. The caption accompanying the image of Saburo reads: "He's setting f-stops and screwing lenses the size of Saturn V rockets" (54). This link clearly problematizes the role of the camera in documenting this scene that speaks of suffering, here playing on the homonym of "shooting" both photographs and guns. The camera/gun connection is also one of power: the power to shoot, the power to represent. As events further unfold, Sacco is able to capture some shots, but when he excit- edly brings them to the offices of a local Palestinian newspaper, he is disappointed when the editor tells him, "There s nothing here" (58). The images themselves turned out; the problem was that Sacco did not capture the faces of the protesters. This reveals that human rights photography is ruled by a kind of aesthetic form; the pho- tographs that are worthy of publishing do not simply capture the moment, but are instead framed in a specific manner. As Wendy Hesford points out, in recent years the most widely recognized human rights images are head shots of young Afghan girls ( 1- 2). Interestingly, the affective charge of facial iconography is closely related to haptic forms of experience. In writing about the power of photographic portraiture as it relates to the iconography of suffering, Andrea Liss quotes Lévinas: "'the face is in search of recompense, an open hand. That is, it needs something. It is going to ask you for something.'" Liss interprets this phrase to mean that "the other s face [. . .] conveys a forceful demand on the subject to open the tense and impalpable space between self and other" (112). In alignment with haptic aesthetics, the image of the suffering face forces a connection between subject and object, between seer and seen, and this</page><page sequence="11">Rebecca Scherr 29 explains why the face is such a sought-after icon when it comes to photographing human rights violations. Sacco, too, claims that capturing individuality by way of drawing detailed faces is part of the political dimension of his work (Vagnes 198). While this connectivity is certainly productive in potentially allowing for an ethical engagement between self and other, Sacco s meditations on photography in Palestine reveal that this seer/seen relationship - especially when "the other" is the other (i.e., economically disadvantaged people of colour from poor and/or despotic countries) - is a priori shot through with uneven power dynamics. Sacco explores this dynamic in one particularly powerful chapter, aptly titled "Public and Private Wounds," where he depicts his experiences visiting a hospital in Nablus. This visit came about through the intervention of some informants who showed Sacco their war wounds and scars: "Wounds!!" exclaims Sacco excitedly to himself, clearly fascinated by the "tactile narrative" of the body told through wounding. When one of these informants asks, "You want to see more?" Sacco is thrilled; this is the real thing, he tells himself: "Of course! Gunshot injuries! Broken bones! Amputees!" (30). At the hos- pital, Sacco tours the bedsides of various adults and children. In a voice dripping with self-irony, he shows his eagerness in snapping pictures, contrasting the usually mindless snapping of a photograph - "Say Cheese!" he tells one of the injured men - with the seri- ousness of the situation. He even draws photo corners around this panel, giving the impression that this page is akin to a page torn from a photo album (see Figure 1). At the very top of page 33, Sacco depicts himself being pulled to a bedside by a grim Palestinian man, and he adds a very telling element: he draws his right hand as oversized and "bleeding" over the border into the panel below (see Figure 2). By hav- ing us pay attention to this hand through the technique of exaggeration, much like we did with the woman handling hot coals, we are forced to look closely at this hand, which appears to be clutching the panel frame below it. This renders the held comics frame as being like a photograph, in that it becomes a framed image, a thing: it appears as a comic book panel but also as a snapshot that Sacco is holding in his hand. In com- bination with the panels framed by photo corners, this implies that these images are drawn directly from the photographs Sacco shows himself taking here. In effect, Sacco overlays the two kinds of evidence drawings and photographs claim: the emotional res- onance of a drawn image is underscored by the referential evidence of human rights photography. At first glance, Sacco seems to attempt a balance between these modes. Yet Sacco also reveals that lurking in this overlay are difficult questions concern- ing the ethics of looking at other people s pain. This becomes evident in the way the sequence on page 33 relates to the sequence on the previous page. On page 32, Sacco is brought to the bedside of a gravely wounded man, who says no to having his picture</page><page sequence="12">1. Joe Sacco. Palestine., 32. © 2012 Joe Sacco.

Courtesy of Fantagraphics Books, Inc.</page><page sequence="14">32 Mosaic 46/1 (March 2013) taken, and yet Sacco decides to depict this scene anyway. Furthermore, the panel showing the man's refusal is linked horizontally to the snapshot sequence on page 33; thus, Sacco places in a row, across the bottom of two pages, panels on the left of some- one s refusal to be photographed, and panels on the right of a little girl who eagerly asks for Sacco to take more pictures. Linked horizontally, they represent two ends of the spectrum when it comes to the participation of "the other" in the act of repre- senting other people's pain, but the outcome for both is the same. In fact, Sacco writes in the caption accompanying the image of the man in his bed, "Okay okay. Io capisco. Say no more. A private wound" (32). In relation to the title of the chapter, this implies that the little girls consent renders her wounds as public; yet his statement must be seen as highly ironic, since the private and public wounds both find their way into representation. The fact that Sacco so self-consciously does this raises a number of issues and questions related to the seer/seen dichotomy. Crucially, in terms of the politics of spectatorship, human rights photography has emerged within an iconographie history that places the viewer into a specific relation- ship to the image, to the others depicted. Sontag is direct in describing this seer/seen relationship, arguing that "the frankest representations of war, and of disaster-injured bodies, are of those who seem most foreign, therefore least likely to be known" (61) and, furthermore, "Generally, the grievously injured bodies shown in published pho- tographs are from Asia or Africa. This journalistic custom inherits the century-old practice of exhibiting exotic - that is, colonized - human beings [. . .] the other, even when not an enemy, is regarded only as someone to be seen, not someone (like us) who also sees" (72). One of Sontags main points in Regarding the Pain of Others is that human rights photography is meant to inform relatively safe people about atrocity occurring elsewhere, and to do so by evoking the viewer's sympathy, but all of this occurs within a dynamic or trajectory whose imperialistic dimensions are so much a part and parcel of viewing habits that the politics of such spectatorship remains invis- ible. This is, perhaps, what Sontag means when she thinks of photographs of atrocity as things that might initially move us but ultimately produce a kind of political paral- ysis (Butler 825). Page 32, then, is a moment when Sacco purposefully takes on the imperial power of the seer, when the other s refusal is given representation anyway; the patient is transformed, against his will, into an object of the gaze. Yet is it more ethi- cally correct for us to look at the little girl just because she seemingly enjoys having her picture taken? She probably does not know how the images of injured Palestinian chil- dren circulate in networks of human rights imagery. And we as readers, who have con- sented to align our "gazes" with Sacco's, must confront what this means for us, as we are inextricably pulled into this voyeuristic relationship whether we like it or not.</page><page sequence="15">Rebecca Scherr 33 By depicting this man's refusal, Sacco creates a moment of real awkwardness, both in terms of self-representation and in terms of how the reader is framed at this moment in the text. In representing this spectrum of consent, Sacco suddenly shows himself, as author and collector of trauma stories, as ethically compromised. He seems to be asking us as readers, Can one create images of others' suffering without relying on this imperialistic gaze? Also, what does it mean to draw someone who refuses to be photographed? What does it mean to look at these drawn images? Is Sacco indicating that this is somehow more ethical, more permissible, because it com- municates something like this happened? Does he use the graphic form, then, and its less referential implications to appease our consciences, at the same time challenging and exposing our voyeuristic attitude? If the photographs themselves were displayed, they might evoke our sympathy, even our empathy; but the way Sacco overlays a pho- tographic rhetoric with graphic sequencing goes even further: his images evoke the reader s empathy while at the very same time pointing to a cluster of more difficult emotions underlying this empathy. This is also a moment where Sacco uses a kind of fissuring technique to bring us to attention. These questions can only be asked because we are meant to ask them: Sacco uses the graphic form to enact an almost palpable clash between photography and drawing, yet this clash and its effects are only possible in the graphic format. It is through the form of an unfolding scenario, as we move across graphic axes that mimic time and space, that the awkwardness and questioning are produced. This is in great contrast to the more singular framing of the photograph, while the graphic novels fusion and fracture of text and image across time and space allow for a kind of dialec- tic to take place. In this case, Sacco highlights an ethically problematic moment of representation, which we as readers experience viscerally as a kind of shove or slap meant to awaken us to the various ethical dilemmas of representing the pain of others: he makes us feel uncomfortable, and then he gets us to think about this dis- comfort and investigate its various dimensions. The awkwardness and discomfort presented in "Private and Public Wounds" is experienced by the reader as feeling, that is, as bodily and emotional resonance. While Sacco uses both drawing and a photographic discourse to call attention to our impe- rialist modes of looking at the other, he uses them to invoke sensation and emotion, thus using the objects of vision in a very haptic manner. Our visual apprehension of the comics frames and sequences transforms quickly into raw emotion: in this chap- ter, these emotions include sympathy, anger, numbness, horror, and shame. Yet Sacco s text as a whole leads his readers to understand that what we may experience as raw emotion is connected to larger events and discourses and to a whole history of seeing</page><page sequence="16">34 Mosaic 46/1 (March 2013) that implicates the presumed viewer in a seemingly paradoxical position of both power and ignorance; thus a haptic aesthetic can also work to call attention to the pol- itics of emotion. This is a text that asks us to feel, but to also place these feelings into larger political contexts, both specific and general: the politics of seeing, the politics of empathie reading, the politics of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. This is the way in which Sacco "touches" the image so as to rework habitual modes of spectatorship when it comes to looking at the pain of others. In response to the scenarios Sacco sets up, we see and feel our own situatedness as readers and as spectators; we cannot take the expected route of a sympathetic reaction. This recognition grants us a certain amount of autonomy, the perception of a kind of space, if you will, between ourselves and the objects of vision. Using the gesture of the handshake as an example of Sacco's project, in such a trajectory we do not become the other but rather recognize the other s situatedness within a larger world and larger discourses as well: we are con- nected to the other in the moment of looking and touching, but in a sense the other is looking back at us, teaching us lessons about what it means to look. While the graphic Whitlock novel looks can at the mediate, potential Suzanne ethical Keen encounters examines between the empathie self and others responses that the graphic novel can mediate, Suzanne Keen examines the empathie responses that graphic novels can produce, what she calls "invitations to narrative empathy prof- fered by graphic storytelling." The intended effect of this kind of empathy, according to Keen, is "for recognition and justice and [. . .] to form citizens' sense of responsibility for suffering others" (135). This resonates very strongly with Marks's claim about the intended effects of haptic visuality, whereby the reading subject "comes into being not through abstraction from the world but through compassionate involvement in it" (141). All of these ideas - Whitlock, Keen, and Marks s - speak of the haptic and strate- gic functioning of texts and images, of the ways artists and writers draw out their audi- ences' emotions and, in doing so, draw us ever more powerfully into the larger world beyond our own small sense of self. As with human rights discourse, in this scenario our encounter with the object of vision becomes a site of empathie feeling where the gap between self and other is bridged or eclipsed by emotion. This empathie encounter is what Sacco's artistry achieves, yet he also qualifies this encounter; that is, he invokes a reader s empathie response and questions it at the same time. It is this questioning of empathy that gives Sacco's work its particular political edge. I do not disagree that narrative empathy is important, but at the same time there is an assumption that the teaching of literature as a form for evoking empathy is unqualifiedly a good thing. Keen in particular advocates this point of view: while the reader's empathy might take on slightly different forms depending on the reading</page><page sequence="17">Rebecca Scherr 35 context, the idea that empathy is the goal of narrative, and that this is a good thing, is not refined or made more complex.4 Yet, as Sontag writes, "Compassion is an unsta- ble emotion. It needs to be translated into action, or it withers" (101). While Sacco's text does not necessarily inspire the reader into action, it does go beyond the simple evocation of empathy as an end in itself. Because his haptic aesthetic mimics the ges- ture of the handshake in which self and other find themselves in a relation of mutu- ality, Sacco's work allows for a dual perception: that we are both connected to the other and we stand in a position of autonomy vis-à-vis the other. This autonomy is crucial for maintaining a critical stance in the face of looking at the pain of others, and it is also this notion of autonomy that is missing in most accounts of the power of haptic aesthetics, for example in Marks s celebration of haptic aesthetics as a method for closing the distance between seer and seen. To do both things at once - to close the gap and to simultaneously sense the impossibility of eclipsing the other - means that we are able to see our privileged position as observers of the pain of others; we do not consume the other, so to speak. In the case of Palestine , Sacco leads us to see our own privilege in the form of our ingrained, imperial modes of looking. Thus we can see that, in the words of Sontag, "our privileges are located on the same map as their suffering" (102, emph. mine); that is, our ways of looking are inextrica- ble from the imperialistic landscape that has produced the situation of the Palestinian people - they are contiguous, touching each other. Sacco's Palestine carefully main- tains that the politics of spectatorship and the world of suffering are embedded in one another, that the one is instrumental in producing the other, and that recognizing this can, perhaps, be the beginning of action.
