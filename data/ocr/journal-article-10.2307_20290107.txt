<plain_text><page sequence="1">DYNAMICS OF LIVING MATTER. Professor Loeb's book on The Dynamics of Living Matter2 is an expansion of a series of lectures on experimental biology which he delivered at Columbia University in 1902. The author's own researches in this branch of science are extremely numerous, and he is well entitled to review the whole subject and formulate general opinions on the mechanism of vital phenomena. He deals with the chemical, physical, and electrical conditions which determine vital energy, and describes the experimental methods which have been employed in studying helio tropism, galvanotropism, and other tropisms?that is to say, reactions?to chemical and other stimuli. Mendel's investigation of the laws of heredity by experimental hybridization of peas is fully explained, and an account is given of the ingenious researches by Morgan and others into the laws determining the regeneration of organs. Professor Loeb is most interesting when he is describing experimental methods and data, but his theories do not always carry conviction, and they lose more than they gain by the controversial manner in which they are often expressed. In discussing the Darwinian theory, he says : The limitation for newly-produced species is not the struggle for existence, but a faulty construction. The idea that mutation is working in a definite direction is a mere anthropomorphism, and, like all anthropomorphisms, is in contradiction with the facts. If Professor Loeb thinks this is the proper way for a scientist to criticize Darwin's work, we must confess that we cannot take him very seriously. The accusation that Darwin framed his conception of evolution after the image of man appears to us rather as an amusing varia tion of the popular prejudice'which incriminates Darwin because he fashioned his conception of man after the image of a monkey. So long as Professor Loeb keeps to "the facts" he is interesting, but when he sneers at the " anthropomorphism " of Darwin, the " mysticism " of Pasteur, and the " prejudices " of all and sundry who have not seen their way to ?interpret all vital phenomena in the 2 Columbia University Biological Series, No. 8.
