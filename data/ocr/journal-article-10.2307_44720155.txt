Weerappuli Ford Motor Company Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT This study examines the biofidelity, repeatability, and reproducibility of various anthropomorphic devices in rear impacts. The Hybrid III, the Hybrid III with the RID neck, and the TAD-50 were tested in a rigid bench condition in rear impacts with AVs of 16 and 24 kph. The results of the tests were then compared to the data of Mertz and Patrick[1]. At a AV of 16 kph, all three anthropomorphic devices showed general agreement with Mertz and Patrick's data [1]. At a AV of 24 kph, the RID neck tended to exhibit larger discrepancies than the other two anthropomorphic devices. Also, two different RID necks produced significantly different moments at the occipital condyles under similar test conditions. The Hybrid III and the Hybrid III with the RID neck were also tested on standard production seats in rear impacts for a AV of 8 kph. Both the kinematics and the occupant responses of the Hybrid III and the Hybrid III with the RID neck differed from each other. Comparison testing of the Hybrid III and TRID necks were conducted on production seats with different NIF scores [2] at AVs of 8 and 16 kph. The two necks responded similarly and no significant differences were observed. The corrected lower neck moment of both necks were predictive of the seats' NIF scores. The Hybrid III and the Hybrid III with the pedestrian pelvis were also tested with standard production seats to determine if hip joint stiffness affected the kinematics of the ATD in rear impacts. The standard Hybrid III is a molded pelvis while the pedestrian pelvis is a cut pelvis. The kinematics and occupant responses of the two Hybrid III configurations were similar to each other. From this study, it can be concluded that the standard Hybrid III dummy is suitable for rear impact testing. INTRODUCTION There are approximately 1 .75 million rear end crashes per year in the United States, accounting for approximately 605,000 injuries. Whereas rear end crashes account for nearly 28.8% of all motor vehicle crash involved injuries, they account for only 4.9% of all motor vehicle involved fatalities [3], The majority of injuries in rear crashes are minor (AIS 1) in severity. For belted occupants in rear crashes, Digges et al [4] have estimated that 25% of the total harm is due to non- contact injuries and another 17% is due to contact with the head restraint. 82% of the non-contact injuries are to the neck. The AIS 1 neck injuries are generally soft tissue sprains which are considered by many to be due to hyperextension of the neck. However, Prasad et al [5] have shown that the hyperextension of the neck, as measured by the change in the relative angle between the head and the first thoracic vertebra, may not accurately reflect the forces and moments developed at the head/neck and the neck/thorax junctions. Utilizing a two-dimensional model of the human spine subjected to rear impact in a rigid seat back and a plastic seat back, the authors showed that the loads and moments at various levels of the cervical spine were substantially reduced in the plastic seat back case in spite of a 2f increase in the head/T1 angle compared to those with the rigid seat back. Prasad et al [5] have also shown that various factors, such as seat back and seat back cushion characteristics (height and stiffness) and head restraint placement, affect the loads developed in the cervical spine in a rear impact. As a result, the experimental evaluation of various seat designs in rear impact should be conducted with Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs) with adequate biofidelity and load measuring capability in the neck. The primary objective of this paper is to report the results of the authors' investigations of the biofidelity and load measuring capability of a currently available ATD, the Hybrid III, and some experimental, prototype ATDs. The secondary objective of this paper is to report experimental results of rear impact sled tests with current 3906</page><page sequence="2">production seats at low-to-medium impact velocities in which AIS 1 type neck injuries are most likely to occur. The test plan reported in this paper is shown below. TEST PLAN a.

These tests were conducted at 16 kph and 24 kph AVs to replicate the severity level of cadaveric and volunteer tests conducted by Mertz and Patrick [1]. RIGID BENCH TESTING TEST METHOD - To determine their biofidelity in rear impacts, three ATD configurations were tested using an experimental protocol similar to that of Mertz and Patrick [1]. They consisted of the Part 572(b) Hybrid III dummy, a Hybrid III dummy in which the original neck was replaced by the Rear Impact Dummy (RID) neck developed by Chalmers University [6], and a prototype of an advanced ATD, the 50m% Thoracic Assessment Device (TAD-50) [7]. Two RID necks were tested in identical test conditions to determine the reproducibility of this device. The TAD-50 utilizes the existing Part 572(b) Hybrid III neck, but the chest construction of the dummy is substantially different from that of the Hybrid III dummy. Whereas the TAD-50 thoracic spine has an articulation representing the flexibility of the human thoracic spine, the Hybrid III dummy has a rigid thoracic spine. It was assumed that comparison between the TAD-50 and Hybrid III dummy responses would reveal the effect of thoracic spine flexibility on head/neck responses. All test devices had instrumentation to measure accelerations, (head, chest, and pelvis), and neck loads at the occipital condyles and at the neck bracket. The neck responses were filtered with a 600 Hz Chebyshev filter. In some of the tests, the ATDs were also instrumented with a lumbar spine load cell and the responses were filtered with a 1000 Hz Chebyshev filter. The sign convention for all instrumentation followed that in SAE J211. The ATDs were consistently placed in normal seating positions on a rigid bench seat constructed of plywood and metal bracing, and were restrained with a 3- point belt system as shown in Figure 1 . The seat back, which ended at shoulder level, had a 2 &lt;f angle with respect to the vertical and the seat cushion plane had a 13.5° angle with respect to the horizontal. There was no head restraint. On two of the 24 kph AV runs, the seat back was cushioned with a thin foam mat to eliminate lumbar spine ringing caused by initial placement of the load cells against a rigid surface. This seat was installed in a rigidized car buck at approximate mid-seat track position. The simulated rear impact collisions were run on a Hyge sled. As shown in Figure 2, the acceleration pulses used in these tests differ from that of Mertz and Patrick's [1], but comparable AVs of 16 and 24 kph were obtained. Throughout this paper, the referenced volunteer and cadaver curves are from "Investigation of the Kinematics and Kinetics of Whiplash" [1] and are compared with a typical response for each ATD configuration. The Hybrid III was tested four times at the lower speed and six times at the higher speed. The Hybrid III with a RID neck was tested twice at the lower speed and four times at the higher speed. The TAD-50 was tested twice at each speed. TEST RESULTS - The test results of primary interest are the head rotation relative to T-1 , neck extension moments at the occipital condyles, linear acceleration (Anterior-Posterior, (A-P) and Superior- Inferior, (S-l)) of the center of gravity of the head, and the angular acceleration of the head. These are the kinematic and kinetic responses of cadavers and volunteers reported by Mertz and Patrick [1]. It should be noted that for the ATDs, the neck torque at the occipital condyles was calculated by the following formula: Myoocc. Cons. = My + (Fx-Dz) + (Fz-Dx) where Fx, Fz, and MY are the loads and torques measured by the upper neck load cell, and Dx and Dz are the distances between the load cell and the head/neck joint. The distances from the head/upper neck joint to the upper neck load cell and from the lower neck/torso joint to the lower neck load cell for the three neck configurations are given in Table 1 .

HYBRID III DUMMY RESPONSE - The Hybrid III dummy head/neck responses in the 16 kph AV tests are shown in Fig. 3 in which cadaver and volunteer responses reported by Mertz and Patrick are also shown. The head extension angle of the dummy was determined from film analysis in a sled fixed coordinate system and assumed to represent extension of the head relative to the thoracic spine since the film analysis showed negligible rotation of the upper torso of the dummy. This definition of the head extension angle is similar to that used by Mertz and Patrick [1] in the cadaver and volunteer tests. To remove any biasing, the initial angle of the head relative to the sled fixed axis system was subtracted from the dynamic response in the current series of tests as well as in those reported by Mertz and Patrick [1] for the cadavers and volunteers. Figure 2. - Sled acceleration pulses: a) AV = 16 kph, b) AV = 24 kph. As seen in Fig. 3, the Hybrid III head extension angle is within measured cadaver responses and is slightly higher than that experienced by the volunteer. The difference between cadaver and volunteer responses can be explained by the lack of muscle tone in the cadavers and potential pre-impact tensing by the volunteer. The Hybrid III dummy peak extension is approximately 20 ms earlier than that seen with the cadaver responses and may be explained by the earlier onset rate in the current sled test series compared to that in Mertz and Patrick's series.

(G), d) occipital condyle torque (Nm). 3909</page><page sequence="5">comparisons between the dummy and cadaveric/volunteer responses for head S-l and P-A accelerations are also shown in Fig. 3. The head S-l accelerations of the Hybrid III dummy compare well with those measured on the cadavers and are higher than those of the volunteer. The P-A acceleration responses of the Hybrid III dummy is of longer duration than those of the volunteer and the cadavers and has peak magnitudes between those of the cadavers and the volunteer. The peak moments at the occipital condyles of the dummy are within those experienced by the two cadavers and slightly higher than that of the volunteer. Based on the above comparison between the Hybrid III dummy head/neck responses and those of the cadavers/volunteer, it can be concluded that the Hybrid III neck is somewhat softer than that of the tensed volunteer and closer in stiffness to that of the two cadavers tested by Mertz and Patrick at 16 kph AV. Figure 4 shows head/neck responses in the 24 kph AV test. The peak head extension of the Hybrid III dummy is approximately 10P higher than those of the cadavers. The calculated angular acceleration of the Hybrid III head is in close agreement with the cadaver data in the 75-150 ms time range. The dummy data show a flexion spike around 45 ms in angular acceleration as well as in occipital condyle torque. Although Mertz and Patrick's data for the cadavers show such tendencies, the earlier part of these responses were not reported by Mertz and Patrick. At this severity of testing, the Hybrid III dummy responses like head accelerations in the S-l and P-A directions are very close to those of the cadavers. The occipital condyle torques in the Hybrid III dummy are also very close to those measured in the cadavers. Based on the tests at 16 and 24 kph AVs with the Part 572(b) Hybrid III dummy, it can be concluded that the Hybrid III dummy neck has adequate biofidelity for determining head/neck kinematics in rear impacts of severity tested. RID NECK RESPONSE - Two RID necks, RID 1 and RID 2, were tested. Only RID 1 , the RID neck system which was borrowed courtesy of Chalmers University, was tested at the 16 kph AV. Figure 5 shows the responses of RID 1 as well as the cadaver and volunteer responses from Mertz and Patrick's study. The peak head extension of RID 1 is slightly higher and like the Hybrid Ill's response, earlier than those of the cadavers. At this test speed, RID 1's head P-A acceleration responses peak magnitudes, (which were higher than the volunteer's), and curve shapes correspond very well to the cadavers but are shifted about 25 ms earlier in the time frame. The RID 1 's S-l head accelerations also compare well with the cadavers and are higher than the volunteer's. The peak torques at the occipital condyle of RID 1 fall within the corridors defined by the cadavers' responses but are higher than the volunteer's peak torques. From these responses, it is judged that the RID neck is sufficiently biofidelic to predict head/neck kinematics in rear impacts at a AV of 16 kph. Like the Hybrid Ill's standard neck, the stiffness of the RID neck is more like those of the cadavers and is softer than the volunteer's. Figure 6 shows the head and upper neck responses of RID 1 and a second RID neck, RID 2, at a 24 kph AV. The magnitude of the peak head extension of both RID 1 and RID 2 compare very well with those seen with the cadavers but their peak durations are about 50 ms shorter. The angular accelerations of the head were only calculated for RID 2 and are much higher and oscillate more than the calculated cadaver responses. Along the P-A axis, the head accelerations of both RID 1 and RID 2 are higher than those of the cadavers but in the S-l direction, the measured head accelerations of both RID 1 and RID 2 are very close to the cadavers. The peak occipital condyle moments measured by RID 1 are about 75% higher than the highest cadaver torque and even exceeds the injury assessment reference value of -57 Nm. In contrast, the torques measured by RID 2 at its occipital condyle are approximately a third of the magnitude of the lowest cadaver torque. There were no test conditions that could account for this large variation between the measured moments of RID 1 and RID 2 other than variations in the hardware of the necks themselves. At the more severe sled test of 24 kph AV, the majority of the head/neck responses of RID 1 and RID 2 do not compare as well with the cadaver responses as they did at the 16 kph AV indicating poorer biofidelity in rear impacts at higher speeds. From the large difference in occipital condyle moments measured by the two different RID necks, it is evident that there is a significant reproducibility problem. This lack of reproducibility shows that the RID neck is not a reliable instrument for testing and measuring occupant responses in rear impacts at its current level of production. TAD-50 RESPONSE - The head/upper neck responses of the TAD-50 at the 16 kph AV are shown in Figure 7. The peak head extension angles of the TAD-50 are noticeably larger than either the volunteer's or even the highest peak of the two cadavers. The TAD-50's head P-A accelerations have longer peak durations than either those of the volunteer or the cadavers with peak magnitudes which fall between the two. Along the S-l axis, the TAD-50 and the cadavers experience very similar head accelerations which occur sooner and are larger than the volunteer's. The maximum torques measured at the TAD-50's occipital condyle fall within the corridors defined by the cadavers and also have initial slopes closer to their responses than the Hybrid III. The head/neck kinematics predicted by the TAD-50 at this lower speed of 16 kph AV compare reasonably well with the responses obtained in Mertz and Patrick's study. As expected, the TAD-50's neck, which is the standard Hybrid III neck, gives responses more like those seen with the cadavers than with the volunteer. At the 24 kph AV the extension curves of the TAD-50's head, seen in Figure 8, match well with those of the cadavers. The head acceleration traces of the TAD-50 along the P-A axis have shapes similar to the cadavers' curves but with lower peak magnitudes.

At the higher AV of 24 kph, the responses of the TAD-50 are slightly closer to those of the cadavers than the Hybrid Ill's. The ability to predict head/neck kinematics in rear impacts with the standard Hybrid III neck, on either the Hybrid III or TAD-50 body, is well proven from these comparisons. The TAD-50, with the additional articulation of the thoracic spine, seems to be slightly more biofidelic at higher impact speeds, but the TAD-50 is not yet in mass production due to design and durability issues. ADDITIONAL RESPONSES - Additional dummy loads and torques for which there is no volunteer or cadaver data were also measured. The RID neck, due to its reproducibility problems, is unsuitable as a reliable test device and therefore, the additional test results of this dummy will not be discussed. The additional upper and lower neck responses of the Hybrid III and TAD-50 at a AV of 16 kph are shown in Figure 10. The upper neck shear and tensile/compressive forces are similar for both ATDs while the lower neck responses are more disparate. At the lower neck, the Hybrid III shear force curves have much steeper initial slopes than the TAD- 50's and higher peak magnitudes. Along the vertical axis, the Hybrid III lower neck load cells measure a largely compressive force while the TAD-50's responses have a significant tensile portion. The lower neck moments, measured at the load cells and those corrected to give the moments at the base of the neck, are similar in magnitude for both crash dummies but the TAD-50's responses peak about 35-40 ms later than those of the Hybrid III. At the 24 kph AV, the upper and lower neck responses of the two ATDs, shown in Figure 1 1 , follow the same trends seen at the lower test speed. The lag between the initial slopes of the TAD-50's upper and lower neck responses and those of the Hybrid III is attributable to the extra flexibility of the TAD-50's articulated thoracic spine joint. This added flexibility also influences the neck and upper torso kinematics. The differences between the lower neck axial responses are due to the added flexibility of the articulated thoracic joint. When there is a large rotation of the head/neck system, a downward shear force, Fs is exerted on the neck at the occipital condyles. This force is resisted by a compressive force at the lower neck joint. For the Hybrid III, the rotation of the lower neck load cell is minimal, and therefore the measured lower neck axial force, Fz, would be equal to this compressive force, (Fig. 9). The added articulation of the TAD-50's spine allows the lower neck load cell to rotate more. This added rotation, 0, changes the orientation of the load cell, and the measured axial force, Fz, now consists of both a compressive component, (Fz»cos0), and a tensile component, (Fz*sin©). This tensile component mitigates the compressive nature of the axial force, Fz measured by the TAD-50' s lower neck load cell. r ^ z.

The lumbar spine responses of the Hybrid III and the TAD-50 at the 16 kph and 24 kph AV test speeds are shown in Figure 12. The TAD-50's shear and tensile/compressive forces are much lower than those of the Hybrid III but its flexion moments are much higher. The TAD-50's additional thoracic articulation seems to mitigate the forces developed at the lumbar spine joint while slightly amplifying the moment as compared to those of the Hybrid III. REAR IMPACT MODEL To verify the existence of compressive forces at the Hybrid III neck load cell location, a mathematical model was exercised. MODEL DESCRIPTION - A mathematical model of the rigid bench tests with the Hybrid III was made using the MADYMO program (Fig. 13). The geometry of the rigid bench seat, the buck's floor, roof, windshield, seat belt system, and ATD at T0 were incorporated into the model's set up. The Hybrid III model was based on the standard 50,h% Hybrid III database provided by TNO in the 5.1 version of MADYMO [8] with one major modification to the neck.

The seat belt system was modeled with the Ford MADYMO Advanced Belt Model (ABM) which is capable of capturing the tensile behavior of belts. The ABM is based on the Articulated Total Body (ATB) harness model and can represent belts, retractors, pretensioners, buckles, and slip rings. The Hyge sled acceleration pulses were used as input. Figure 13. - MADYM03D rear impact model. MODEL RESULTS - The MADYMO rear impact model simulations correlated reasonably well to their respective Hyge sled tests in regards to both occupant kinematics and responses. The movement of the Hybrid III dummy in the model animations was very similar to that seen in the test films. This is confirmed by the close agreement of the theoretical and experimental head extension curves (Fig. 15). The tensile/compressive responses of the model, for both the upper and lower neck, reflect the trends seen in the tests, including the compressive nature of the response at the lower neck. PRODUCTION SEAT TESTING HYBRID III NECK vs. RID NECK - In addition to the rigid bench seat testing, low speed rear impact Hyge sled tests were conducted using production bucket front seats. These seats were installed in the appropriate rigidized sled buck and set in mid-seat track position with a seat back angle of 21° and with the adjustable head restraints in the full up position, see Fig. 14. For each run, a Hybrid III and a Hybrid III with a RID neck, (RID 2), were placed in the front seats in normal 50,h% sitting position. Both ATDs were restrained by 3-point belt systems.

This motion caused the RID 2 to exert a larger downward force on the head restraint which slipped during the crash pulse. For this test condition, the responses of the two ATDs had similar shapes although there were evident differences. The RID 2 upper neck shear response was of shorter duration than that of the Hybrid Ill's and had slightly higher peak magnitudes (Fig. 17). The RID 2 peak upper neck tensile force was approximately 60% higher than the Hybrid Ill's but conversely, the peak occipital condyle moment of the Hybrid III was almost three times that of the RID 2. These differences between the upper neck responses are probably due to the reproducibility problem with the RID neck instead of any differences due to neck design. As seen in the rigid bench testing (Fig. 6), RID 2 significantly under-predicted the occipital condyle moment even when compared to another RID neck, RID 1. At the lower neck joint, the peak magnitudes of the shear and tensile/compressive forces of the RID 2 were again higher than those of the Hybrid III. The lower neck moments of the two ATDs were similar but the RID 2 peaked slightly earlier and higher than the Hybrid III. HYBRID III NECK vs. TRID NECK - The TRID, (TNO Rear Impact Dummy), neck was developed by TNO specifically for low severity rear impacts of speeds up to 25 kph [9]. It was designed to directly replace the Hybrid III neck with no alterations to the rest of the Hybrid III or its instrumentation. Comparison testing between ATDs with the two necks was conducted using three different types of production seats sold in the European market. The relative insurance claim frequency of these seats has been reported by Eichberger et al [2]. The authors have developed a scale called the NIF (Neck Injury Factor). An NIF of 1 would correspond to the average claim frequency; above 1 would correspond to higher and below 1 to lower than average claim frequency in the insurance files. The three seats used in this series of experiments were chosen to represent NIF = 0.7, 1 .1 and 1 .5. The aim of the experiments was to determine if the neck loads in tests with these seats would distinguish the NIF differences between them. The secondary aim was to determine the differences between the Hybrid III and the TRID necks in their sensitivity to differences in the three seat designs. The ATDs were placed in normal seating position and restrained by 3-pt seat belts. The seats were mounted on a rigid platform buck and placed into mid- seat track position with a seat back angle of 21°, see Fig. 18. If the head restraint was adjustable, it was placed in the full up position. Each individual seat underwent two simulated Hyge sled rear impacts; one at a AV of 8 kph and one at a AV of 16 kph. Only one seat and one ATD was tested at a time. The sled acceleration pulses, seen in Figure 16, were derived from a 80.5 kph car-to-car rear impact acceleration trace. Figure 16. - Production seat Hyge sled acceleration pulses: AVs = 8 and 16 kph. Figures 19 and 20 show the peak magnitudes of the upper and lower neck forces and moments of both ATDs for the respective AVs of 8 and 16 kph. They are also listed in Appendix A, Tables 1 and 2. In general, the Hybrid III and TRID necks responded similarly across all the tests. The only noticeable and consistent difference was that the Hybrid III measured lower peak occipital condyle moments in extension than the TRID, although in one case they were nearly equal. In terms of the performance of the seats, none of the upper neck responses of either ATD, including the occipital condyle moment, were predictive of the trend in the NIF scores for both test speeds. For the Hybrid III, both the measured and corrected lower neck moment in extension showed the trend in the NIF scores (Fig. 21). The Hybrid Ill's positive lower neck shear force peak magnitudes also showed the trend in NIFs but are not as sensitive as the bending moment. With the TRID, only the corrected lower neck moment in extension is predictive of the NIF scores, although, at the higher 16 kph AV, the TRID's uncorrected lower neck moment also predicted the trend. Even though the performance of the two different ATD necks were not identical, no major differences or contradictions were evident from their responses. Regardless of the neck used, the corrected lower neck moment seemed to be the best sorter of the NIFs. EFFECT OF PELVIS DESIGN - The flesh of the standard Hybrid III pelvis is one foam piece which is molded into the seated position. Because of its construction, the standard pelvis hip joint has been postulated as being too stiff to allow the legs to rotate away from the torso as easily as a human's in rear impacts. As a result, the head/neck and upper torso kinematics in rear impacts could be different from those of human occupants. To see if there was any basis to this theory and how this would affect the neck responses, comparison testing with the pedestrian pelvis was performed. The flesh of the pedestrian pelvis consists of three separate, cut foam pieces which allow the Hybrid III 3922</page><page sequence="18">Figure 17. - Hybrid III vs. RID, production seat, AV = 8 kph: a) upper neck Fz (N), b) upper neck Fz (N), c) corrected upper neck My (Nm), d) lower neck Fx (N), e) lower neck Fz (N), f) lower neck My (Nm). 3923</page><page sequence="19">Figure 18. - Production seat set-up: a) Hybrid III, NIF = 1.5, b) TRID, NIF = 1.5, c) Hybrid III, NIF = 1.1, d) TRID, NIF = 1.1, e) Hybrid III, NIF = 0.7, f) TRID, NIF = 0.7. 3924</page><page sequence="20">350 i 300 250 ill I i ■ ■ 250 Up Neck Up Neck Cor.

Hyge sled tests with AVs of 8, 16, and 24 kph were conducted with two different Hybrid III dummy configurations: a Hybrid III with the standard pelvis and a Hybrid III with the pedestrian pelvis. The ATDs were placed in normal seating position in production bucket front seats, see Fig. 22. The seats were set in mid-seat track position with a seat back angle of 21° and with the head restraint in the full-up position. The Hybrid III with the standard pelvis flesh was restrained with a passive shoulder belt/active lap belt system, while the Hybrid III with the pedestrian pelvis was restrained by a 3-pt seat belt system. 100-1 6 ■ Z 'w BO Ö o &lt; 0 tí 60 X 40 £ Hill.

As seen in Figure 23, the kinematics of the Hybrid III, regardless of pelvis type, are similar at each test speed. At the 8 kph AV, both ATDs primarily moved rearwards with very little rotation. At the higher AVs of 16 and 24 kph, the Hybrid III with the standard pelvis does rotate more than the Hybrid III with the pedestrian pelvis, and conversely, the Hybrid III with the pedestrian pelvis ramps slightly higher up the seat back than the standard Hybrid III. These differences, however, may be due to the different restraint systems rather than the pelvis flesh. The separate lap belt may have restricted the upward displacement of the standard Hybrid III more than the 3- pt belt system, thereby, resulting in more rotation and less ramping. It should be noted that the femurs of both Hybrid III configurations rotated upward and around the lap belt, restraining the lower torso. Also, the primary cause of this seems to be the rearward movement of the lower legs which forces the femurs to move upwards, rather than hip joint stiffness.

Figures 24-26 show the peak magnitudes and the standard deviation of the samples for the different test speeds, (also listed in App. A, Tables 3-5).

Even though these differences were evident across the speed range, it should be noted that they were not significant across the range and usually fell within the standard deviations for each specific test. The effect of pelvis type, standard Hybrid III or pedestrian, seems to have had a minimal effect on both the neck responses as well as the ATD's kinematics. In fact, the differences between the restraint system may have been an equal or larger contributor to the slightly increased occupant rotation seen with the Hybrid III with the standard pelvis than the pelvis itself. Whether or not the pelvis flesh was one piece of molded foam or three separate pieces did not seem to be significant. DISCUSSION Two different neck designs on the basic Hybrid III dummy have been tested in identical conditions. The head/neck responses of these necks were compared against known responses of cadavers at two test speeds (AVs of 16 and 24 kph) and a volunteer at one test speed (16 kph AV). Linear and angular accelerations of the Hybrid III dummy head compare well with those recorded on cadavers in similar test conditions. The moments developed at the head/neck junction of the Hybrid III dummy also compare well with those estimated at the head/neck junction of the cadavers at both speeds. The Hybrid III neck responses are closer to those of the cadavers than those of the volunteer. Based on the experimental data discussed earlier in this paper, the Hybrid III neck has adequate biofidelity for rear impact testing. The second neck tested, the RID, also has adequate biofidelity at the lower 16 kph AV, but lacks biofidelity at the higher, 24 kph AV. Additionally, the reproducibility of the RID neck was shown to be poor. A third neck, the TRID, was tested with three different seats and its responses were compared to those of the Hybrid III neck. No significant differences in response trends were observed between these two dummy necks. Since the TRID neck was developed for low speed testing, the tests were conducted at AVs of 8 and 16 kph with production seats that were equipped with head restraints. Based on the comparison of the Hybrid III neck responses with those of the TRID neck, the Hybrid III is suitable for rear impact testing from AVs of 8 kph to higher speeds. The above conclusion regarding the suitability of the Hybrid III dummy for rear impact testing is contrary to the opinions of Svensson and Lovsund [6] and of reference [8]. Svensson and Lovsund's [6] opinion is based on a previous paper by Seemann ef a/ [12] in which it was claimed that the Hybrid III neck was too stiff in the sagittal plane. However, Seemann's study [12] compared the flexion responses of the dummy with those of trained, Navy volunteers in frontal impact sled simulations. No extension response studies were conducted by Seemann. Additionally, since the initial seated position of the human volunteers were erect and the Hybrid III dummy neck is designed for seated posture in a passenger car, the conclusions reached by Seemann are not justified, even for flexion. Svensson and Lovsund [6] further cite a modeling study of Deng [13] that concluded that the torque response of the Hybrid III neck is similar to that of the human neck, but it has a higher shear response. In our testing with the TRID neck, which is a further refinement of the RID neck, no significant differences in shear response have been noted. Two thoracic spine designs were tested and the test results have been described previously in this paper. Based on the available data, an articulated thoracic spine appears to somewhat improve correlation between dummy head/neck responses and cadaver responses. The peak bending moments and forces at the head/neck junction are nearly the same with both dummies. Differences in force and moment responses recorded at the lower neck load cells are different. However, these differences are due to the different locations of the load cells in the two dummy spines. It should be noted that the bending stiffness of the additional articulation in the thoracic spine of the TAD-50 was selected arbitrarily, and its biofidelity needs further investigation. Two different pelvis designs were tested, a base Hybrid III and a pedestrian pelvis. The head/neck responses with the two pelvises are within test-to-test repeatability. The overall dummy kinematics are also the same. Both dummy pelvises show that the dummy femurs rotate up and load the lap belt. LOWER NECK INJURY ASSESSMENT REFERENCE VALUES - The upper and lower neck responses are shown in Figures 27 and 28, (and listed in Appx. A, Tables 6 and 7), for the 16 and 24 kph AV rigid bench seat tests. Mertz and Patrick [1] have reported no discernible neck injuries in the 16 kph AV tests. In the 24 kph AV tests, a small sized cadaver showed minor ligamentous rupture at an estimated 34.4 Nm bending moment at the occipital condyle. The currently known Injury Assessment Reference Value, (IARV), for neck bending is based on this data [10]. An estimate of the bending moment at the C7-T1 junction was not made by Mertz. However, with the results of the current series of tests with the Hybrid III dummy, such an estimate can be made. The average bending moment at the occipital condyle of the Hybrid III dummy in 6 tests is 34.5 Nm. Assuming that the neck length and kinematics of the neck in the current series of tests are similar to those of the cadavers tested by Mertz and Patrick, the bending moments at the C7-T1 junction in the cadaver test should be similar to those measured by the dummy. The average corrected lower neck extension moment was 1 12.1 Nm. This value can be tentatively associated with minor ligamentous damage for the population represented by the cadaver tested by Mertz and Patrick [1]. Since the upper neck extension moments in these tests averaged 34.5 Nm and the IARV for a 50lh% adult male has been estimated by Mertz [10] to be 57 Nm, the IARV for the corrected lower neck extension moment should also be higher than the measured 1 1 2.1 Nm for a 3930</page><page sequence="26">600 ļ 500 400 FT*1 |T ¡s 300 ^ 300 ~ ļfiļ ^ I ■ ■ .

Comparing the corrected lower and upper neck moments for the Hybrid III dummy from Tables 6 and 7 In Appendix A, we find that the corrected lower neck moments are approximately 3.28 times the corrected upper neck moments. Therefore, if the upper neck extension IARV for the 5 (f % male adult is 57 Nm, the lower neck extension IARV could be 187 Nm. Since 187 Nm is associated with an injury, the threshold could be somewhat lower. Mertz and Patrick [11] have also estimated that 47 Nm is a non-injurious extension moment at the occipital condyles of a mid-size male. Using our ratio of 3.28 between the lower neck moment and occipital condyle moment, the non-injurious lower neck moment would be 154 Nm. Therefore, the threshold for ligamentous damage for a mid-size male would range between 154 Nm and 186 Nm. With similar reasoning, the lower neck extension IARV with the TAD-50, which has an approximate ratio of 2.79, should range between 131 Nm and 156 Nm. Further testing with smaller size dummies and cadavers are suggested to further verify the suggested IARV from these tests. CONCLUSION 1 . The head and neck responses of the Hybrid III dummy correlate very well with the cadaveric head/neck responses in the rigid bench seat tests with AVs of 16 and 24 kph reported by Mertz and Patrick [1]. 2. The RID neck is biofidelic at the lower speed tested, (AV = 16 kph), with the rigid bench seat. It was bottoming out at the higher test speed, (AV = 24 kph), and had poor reproducibility. 3. Testing of production seats with the Hybrid III and the TRI D necks showed no major differences in the responses of interests between the two necks. 4. The TAD-50 dummy, with an articulated thoracic spine, seems to be less biofidelic at the lower speed but slightly more biofidelic at the higher speed. 5. No significant differences in head/neck responses were found between the one-piece molded Hybrid III dummy pelvis and the three-piece pedestrian pelvis. 6. The corrected lower neck extension moment appeared to be the most sensitive response in the European production seat rear impact testing. 7. When utilizing the Hybrid III dummy, the threshold for ligamentous damage for a mid-size male ranges between 154 Nm and 186 Nm. With A TAD-50 dummy, the range is from 131 Nm to 156 Nm. 8. Based on the results of this study, the Hybrid III dummy is a suitable dummy for rear impact testing of automotive seat designs. Since all production seats have cushion in the seat back and are equipped with head restraints, the severity of impact up to which the Hybrid III is biofidelic for rear impacts is much higher than the 24 kph AV with the rigid seats. A companion paper [14] shows that even in 40 kph AV impacts with production seats, the load levels experienced by the dummy neck are below those developed in the rigid seat tests. As a result, the Hybrid III dummy is a suitable dummy for rear impact testing at AVs exceeding 40 kph - a speed covering 94% of all NASS rear-end collisions [14].
