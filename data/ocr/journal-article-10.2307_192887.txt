<plain_text><page sequence="1">Geometry, Time and Force in the Diagrams of Descartes, Galileo, Torricelli and Newton Emily R. Grosholz Pennsylvania State University Mathematics plays a central role in the description, explanation and manipulation of natural phenomena. To what extent, and how and why mathematics applies to nature is a problem that has long occupied philosophers. Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Mach and Poincar6, to mention some of the most distinguished names, offer global solutions to this problem that are based on deep-lying metaphysical assumptions. In this essay, I would like to suggest an alternative approach, which is piecemeal rather than global, and histori- cal before it is metaphysical. I want to propose, first, that the question of applied mathematics be recast as a ques- tion about how mathematics and physics, a physics "always already" mathematized, are partially unified at various points in history, in such a way that they can share certain items, problems and methods while nonetheless remaining quite distinct. And, second, I suggest that these unifications may be quite heterogeneous and variable over time. If we consider Archimedes' combination of geometry and statics, the Bernoulli's development of the theory of differential equations in the service of mechanics, and the twentieth cen- tury marriage of logic and computer technology in all their rich historical detail, we may decide that the factors that distinguish them are philosophically more interesting than those they have in common. In short, perhaps philosophers ought to reason upwards from case studies of the multifarious ways in which mathematical and physical domains can be joined, before they attempt to make global pronouncements about that union. The present essay is one such case study. Its focus is the project of a geometrical physics presented in Descartes' Principles of Philosophy, and which also apparently depends on his Geometry. My argument is that Descartes' conception of the "order of reasons" both orga- nizes and impoverishes his mathematics and his physics, and moreover interferes with his own intention to unify them in a novel and more thoroughgoing way. Then I will show how his contemporaries Galileo and Torricelli profit from possibilities that Descartes' strongly reductionist methodology has excluded, and so manage to achieve a deeper unification of mathematics and physics, specifically with respect to the parameters of time and force. In a famous passage in the Principles of Philosophy, Part II, section 11, Descartes announces a kind of identity between the object of geometrical study, space, and the object of physics, res extensa, matter. He writes: "If we concentrate on the idea which we have of some body, for example a stone, and remove from that idea everything which we PSA 1988, Volume 2, pp. 237-248 Copyright ? 1989 by the Philosophy of Science Association</page><page sequence="2">238 know is not essential to the nature of body; we shall easily understand that the same extension which constitutes the nature of body also constitutes the nature of space, and that these two things differ only in the way that the nature of genus or species differs from that of the individual." (Miller and Miller 1983/4, p. 34). A physical object is thus precisely and merely an instantiation of a region of three-dimensional Euclidean space. And he reiterates this identification of the subject matter of physics and that of geometry quite strongly in the last section of Part II of the Principles: "For I openly acknowledge that I know of no kind of material substance other than that which can be divided, shaped, and moved in every possible way, and which Geometers call quantity and take as the object of their demonstrations." (Miller and Miller 1983/4, p. 77). Behind this conflation of physical with mathematical objects lies Descartes' desire to purify physics of the anthropomorphic, intentional and psychological qualities and expla- nations of late Renaissance science, of the iron filings which long for the loadstone and the planets which keep turning themselves to avoid a sunburn on one side. And therein lies the origin of the austere and noble project of modern science, to know nature apart from the accidents of human perception and perhaps even our conceptual categories, to know nature without projecting a human face on it. Matter, according to Descartes, has no attributes besides the quantifiable ones that stem from its extendedness. The essence of matter is therefore also mathematical; matter has an inherent structure articulable as Euclidean geometry. And since Descartes' great mathematical work, the Geometry, is designed to reformulate and rationalize Euclidean geometry, his project of mathematizing nature would seem here to find its appropriate grounding. Philosophical historians of the seventeenth century however have not failed to notice that Descartes' successes in mathematizing physics are few and far between: he enunci- ates a theorem in optics, a characterization of inertial motion and something like a con- servation of momentum principle for impact. The rest of his physics, expounded at length in the Principles, the World and the Treatise of Man (for Descartes, biology was a part of physics), is surprisingly qualitative and inexact; it advances by loose analogy and a quite imaginative array of "mechanisms". I would like to explain this puzzling incongruity at the heart of Descartes' project as a consequence of the way his method leads him to organize geometry and physics, for his strongly reductionist and therefore homogenizing way of arranging a subject matter impedes the development of his mathematics and generates severe conceptual problems for his physics. And since it also leads him to conflate the domains of geometry and physics, it ultimately tends to block their unification. Descartes holds that a subject matter can and should be organized according to "the order of reasons," as a linear progression from simples to complexes, such that each item in the chain is known without the aid of succeeding items and all items are known solely on the basis of those that precede them. Thus a subject matter begins with items that are known in themselves, and becomes a progression of successively more complex entities that are simples in some kind of association. The simples for Cartesian geometry, as he announces on the first pages of the Geometry, are rectilinear line segments, and their form of association is proportions (Smith and Latham 1954, pp. 2-5). The complexes are then problems (like the trisection of the angle, or the instances of Pappus' problem dis- cussed below) and higher algebraic curves (like the conic sections, and some cubics), which Descartes ranges into hierarchies in Books II and III of the Geometry. Descartes' choice of starting points, straight line segments which alone can stand as terms in relations of proportionality, helps to streamline and reorganize geometry. The closed algebra of line lengths that opens the Geometry allows him to use algebra in the solution of geometrical problems, and to define the multiplication of line segments for any number of factors, where classical Greek mathematics limited the number of factors</page><page sequence="3">239 to three. Thus, to choose the example central to the Geometry, he is able to solve in a more general way than possible theretofore a locus problem from the canon of classical antiquity called "Pappus' problem". Nonetheless, Descartes' choice of such "simple" and homogeneous starting points also excludes certain other items from serving as terms in his proportions: areas and vol- umes (which the Greeks used in their proportions), and curves and infinitesimals (which contemporary mathematicians were using in their proportions). Areas and volumes, aside from a fleeting mention in one paragraph which is left undeveloped, are never treated in the Geometry, nor are infinitesimals. Curves are in one sense the subject matter of Book II of the Geometry, but Descartes' treatment of them keeps sliding over to the problems, nexuses of straight line segments, in which they figure merely as constructing curves. As is well known, Descartes banishes transcendental curves from geometry, but it is equally true that the tendency of his reductive method to pull the complexes back to the simples, in this case, the investigation of curves back to nexuses of straight line segments, severely restricts his investigation of higher algebraic curves. Nor does Descartes see in a clearly focussed way the power of his own innovation in the Geometry, which allows the investigation of curves as algebraic-geometrical-numeri- cal hybrids, a multivalence that is the key to their investigation and their employment in physics in the latter half of the seventeenth century. Descartes' intuitionism makes him distrust the formal apparatus of algebra, and his insistence on the homogeneity of his sub- ject matter leads him to conflate numbers and line segments, rather than presenting them as two distinct domains linked by a shared structure, that is, the algebra of line lengths given at the beginning of Book I. For Descartes, curves are primarily constructing curves, to be used to construct points in the solution of problems, and hence he never recognizes their rich multivalence and variety. The mathematics of Descartes' Geometry, pruned and homogenized as it is by the demands of method, is then curiously inapt for the representations required by contempo- rary physics. I can best illustrate my argument thus far by comparing his treatment of Pappus' problem with Galileo's analysis of free fall in the Two New Sciences. Pappus' problem is really a (countably infinite) set of problems, each of which asks for the deter- mination of a locus whose points satisfy one of the following conditions illustrated by the following diagram: Let the di denote the length of the line segment from point P to Li which makes an angle of (i with Li. Choose ot/3 to be a given ratio and a to be a given line segment (Bos 1981). (Diagram 1) Diagram 1</page><page sequence="4">240 The problem is to find the points P which satisfy the following conditions. If an even number (2n) of lines Li are given in position, the ratio of the product of the first n of the di to the product of the remaining n di should be equal to the given ratio o/[P, where a and P are arbitrary line segments. If an odd number (2n - 1) of lines Li are given in position, the ratio of the product of the first n of the di to the product of the remaining (n-1) di times a should be equal to the given ratio at/p. (The case of three lines is an exception, since it aris- es when two lines coincide in the four line problem.) There are in fact points which satisfy each such condition, and they will form a locus on the plane. Since the Greeks interpreted the products of two and three lines respectively as areas and volumes, Pappus, reporting on the work of Apollonius, hesitated to generalize beyond the case of six fixed lines. In the middle of Book I, Descartes describes his attack on the problem and then proudly announces, "I believe that I have in this way completely accomplished what Pappus tells us the ancients sought to do," (Smith and Latham 1954, pp. 26-7) as if he had solved the prob- lem in a thoroughgoing way for any number of lines. While it is true that his combination of algebraic-arithmetical and geometrical results produces an important advance in the solu- tion of the problem, his treatment of the problem in the Geometry is hardly complete, for he adds only one new locus, the solution to a five-line version of the problem, to those already known, that is, the conic sections, which correspond to four-line versions of it. Descartes' explanation of how he proposes to solve this problem occurs at the end of Book I, accompanied by a diagram of its four line version (Smith and Latham 1954, pp. 26- 35). (Diagram 2) He chooses y equal to BC (which is dl) and x equal to AB, and shows how all the other di can be expressed linearly in x and y. Then the proportions defining the condi- tions for the cases of 2n and (2n - 1) lines given above can be rewritten as equations in x and y. For 2n lines, the equation will be of degree at most n; for (2n-1) lines, it will be of degree at most n, but the highest power of x will be at most (n-1). (For 2n and (2n-1) parallel lines, where y is the sole variable involved, the result is an equation in y of degree at most n.) T sr ,R E /A " B \ / D /--- '- ------------ Diagram 2 The point-wise construction of the locus is then undertaken as follows. One chooses a value for y and plugs it into the equation, thus producing an equation in one unknown, x. For the case of 2n lines, the equation is of degree at most n and for (2n-1) lines, it is of degree at most (n-1). The roots of this equation can then be constructed by means of intersecting curves which must be decided upon. This procedure, infinitely iterated, gen-</page><page sequence="5">241 erates the curve point by point (Bos 1981). Thus it seems that Pappus' problem has been reduced to the geometrical construction of roots of equations in one unknown: the con- struction of line segments on the basis of rational relations among other line segments. The combination of algebra and geometry is worthy of note. By rewriting the condi- tions of the problem as an equation, Descartes has converted it from a proportionality involving lines, areas or volumes as terms (as it was in the classical formulation) to an equation about line segments. It has become an algebraic problem to which techniques for simplifying and solving equations can be applied. Yet it has not ceased to be a geometric problem as well, though the algebraic conversion has altered the geometry. The diagram is still centrally present, though it only involves rectilinear line segments; no areas or vol- umes intervene here or as the focus of auxiliary constructions. The auxiliary constructions will be instead the construction of each x for a given y, using certain chosen constructing curves as well as various geometrical theorems. Because the problem can be viewed simultaneously as algebraic and geometrical, results from both domains can be brought to bear upon it, thus organizing and facilitating its solution. Also, Descartes' abstract state- ment of the procedure seems to impose no limits on the number of lines initially "given in position," and thus to escape the strictures of the Greek formulation entirely. And yet Descartes' solution to Pappus' problem does not result directly in the discov- ery and investigation of a rich collection of new algebraic curves. For one thing, the con- struction of roots of higher algebraic equations, and therefore points on the relevant loci, is not as easy as Descartes' naive faith in the step-wise advance of reason envisages. And secondly, the strongly reductionist drift of Cartesian method keeps deflecting his interest from curves back to nexuses of line segments. The very first thing that Descartes says about his approach to Pappus' problem may seem odd if we expect him to be primarily interested in the loci which the problem generates (Smith and Latham 1954, pp. 24-5). (I have corrected the translation of the word "degre".) First, I discovered that if the question be proposed for only three, four, or five lines, the required points can be found by elementary geometry, that is, by the use of the ruler and compasses only, and the application of those principles which I have already explained, except in the case of five parallel lines. In this case, and in the cases where there are six, seven, eight, or nine given lines, the required points can always be found by means of the geometry of solid loci, that is, by using some one of the three conic sections. Here, again, there is an exception in the case of nine parallel lines. For this and the cases of ten, eleven, twelve, or thirteen given lines, the required points may be found by means of a curve of level next higher (degre plus compose) than that of the conic sections. Again, the case of thirteen parallel lines must be excluded, for which, as well as for the cases of fourteen, fif- teen, sixteen, and seventeen lines, a curve of level next higher (degre plus com- pose) than the preceding must be used; and so on indefinitely. For in this passage, he is classifying cases of the problem not by some feature of the locus generated, but rather by what kind of curve can be chosen in the point-wise con- struction of the locus, that is, in the construction of the line segment x given the relevant equation in x and y and a definite value for y. He iterates this classification of cases at the very end of Book I in more explicitly algebraic terms. Otherwise stated, this classificato- ry scheme does not pertain to curves (describable by indeterminate equations in two unknowns) but to problems (describable by determinate equations in one unknown). Curves intervene in this passage only as constructing curves; each higher level of prob- lem will require a constructing curve of higher level (degre plus compose). The diagram just given contains no hint of the locus, only the nexus of line segments with their specified relations to an arbitrary point C of the locus. The implied auxiliary construction would be the determination of the line segment x (for a given value of y) by</page><page sequence="6">242 means of certain constructing curves. The official subject of these diagrams are line seg- ments; constructing curves also intervene, but we have never been told quid juris and they are not what the diagram is about. Descartes' commitment to the methodological presupposition that his geometry begins with proportions among rectilinear line segments only, structures and narrows his whole enterprise. Thus, Descartes' very first announcement concerning the Pappian cases is that he has discovered a way to generalize the classification of problems. And he reiterates this clas- sification at the end of Book I and indeed on the final page of the Geometry. However, the announcement leaves vague what it means to say that the constructing curves which are required for each successive level of problems are of "degre plus compose". Thus, Descartes' first way of grouping Pappian cases is supplemented by a second, which explicitly classifies loci. But I want to argue that the fact that this classification of loci is given second is quite significant. Descartes is not interested in classifying curves for their own sake; he undertakes the second classification in order to clarify the first, and regards the curves primarily as constructing curves. Galileo's treatment of free fall in the Third Day of his Two New Sciences requires dia- grams that could have no counterpart in Descartes' Geometry. Theorem I, Proposition I, states : "The time in which any space is traversed by a body starting from rest and uniform- ly accelerated is equal to the time in which that same space would be traversed by the same body moving at a uniform speed whose value is the mean of the highest speed and the speed just before acceleration began." (Crew and deSalvio 1954, pp. 173-4). (Diagram 3) As Koyre points out, the genius of this diagram is that AB represents not the distance traversed (that role is played by the separate line CD) but the time elapsed. Galileo has C G A E F B Diagram 3 wrested geometry from the geometer's preoccupation with extension, and put it in the ser- vice of the essentially temporal processes of physics (Koyr6 1939, pp. 67-73). What I want to stress about the diagram is that it involves areas and a process like integration with</page><page sequence="7">243 respect to time; the parallels of the triangle AEB perpendicular to AB represent velocities, and the area of the triangle as a whole, taken to be a summation of instantaneous velocities, therefore represents distance elapsed. In other words, in this diagram distance is represented in two different ways, as the line segment CD and as the area of triangle AEB; because the second representation is a two-dimensional figure, it can exhibit the way that uniformly increasing velocity and time are related in the determination of a distance. Moreover, the triangle AEB is a summation of infinitesimal momenti, and is able to be so in virtue of the painstaking discussion of the possibility of continuously and uniformly accelerated motion that begins the Third Day. Koyre observes that Descartes the physicist rejects Galileo's arguments about the continuity of motion because of his commitment to instants (Koyre 1939, pp. 62-3); I want to point out that Descartes the mathematician has short-circuited the possibility that diagrams such as Galileo's have a place even in geometry. So too with the diagram to Theorem II, Proposition I, which supplements the one just discussed. The theorem states: "The spaces described by a body falling from rest with uni- formly accelerated motion are to each other as the squares of the time-intervals employed in traversing these distances." Once again there are two components to the diagram (Crew and deSalvio 1954, pp. 174-6). (Diagram 4) The line HI stands for the spatial trajectory of the falling body, but it is articulated into a sort of ruler, where the intervals representing distances traversed during equal stretches of time, HL, LM, MN etc., are marked off, forming the sequence of odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7... as Corollary I notes. AB represents time (divided into equal intervals AD, DE, EF, etc.) with perpendicular instantaneous velocities raised upon it, generating a series of areas. Distance traversed again has two distinct representations; this time one is geometric and the other numerical. The distinction is as important as the corre- spondence in the investigations of mechanics and mathematics leading from Galileo to the calculus at the end of the century, particularly in the reasoning that gave Leibniz his central insight into the calculus (Grosholz 1982). But Descartes' conflation of number and geometry stands in the way of such thinking. Nowhere in the Geometry does Descartes discuss how to combine the combinatorial patterns of number theory and geometrical results. A H F- _c A N -- D \ C B B C Diagram 4 Diagram5 As it happens, Descartes in his youth (in 1619 and again in 1629) considered the prob- lem of free fall. Beeckman proposed a version of it to him, and in his private journal, Descartes sketched out a solution to it (Adam and Tannery 1964/74, X: 219f). (Diagram 5) Descartes, however, takes the line ADB to represent, not the time elapsed but the distance traversed. Since he considers the lines parallel to AB as representing velocity, triangle ADE stands for the "quantity of motion" expended as the body traverses AD, and the quadrilateral DECB the same as the body traverses DB; since the latter is three times the former, he concludes that the body moves through the second interval of distance three</page><page sequence="8">244 times as quickly. The reasoning thus leads him to suppose that in uniformly accelerated motion like free fall the velocity increases proportionally to the distance traversed, not to time. This was a common mistake in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century; but Descartes' later attack on the problem in 1629 and his continuing criticisms of Galileo show that he never learned to see the crucial difference between taking time rather than space as the important parameter (Koyre 1939, pp. 40-5.) And though in these early solutions, the geometrical representation is suggestively close to Galileo's, Descartes' interest in it never revives, especially after what Koyre calls the "revolution of 1630" when Descartes decides that knowledge should be reconstructed according to the "order of reasons." Up to this point, I have tried to indicate how Descartes' reconstruction of mathematics forecloses upon mathematical structures that might have been useful to him in the mathematization of physics. Now I want to argue more in the vein of Koyre that his reordering of physics also interferes with that project of mathematization. In the Principles of Philosophy, the starting points, the simples, for Cartesian physics are bits of matter in uniform (unaccelerated) rectilinear motion. Bits of matter are associ- ated when they share a common (uniform, rectilinear) motion; Descartes says repeatedly in sections 27 - 32 of Part II that the unity of a material body is precisely the common motion, or common rest, of its parts, and can be attributed to no other mode (Miller and Miller 1983/4, pp. 52-5). Material unities are deflected or disrupted when they collide with other bits of matter; collision for Descartes is the only kind of physical interaction. The three laws of motion given in Part II (sections 37 - 52) define inertial motion, which inheres in and signals the unity of material bits, and mathematize impact as seven rules, in each of which particles of various sizes and speeds collide along straight lines (Miller and Miller 1983/4, pp. 59-69). The consequent changes of speed are instantaneous, and conserve the total "momentum," the product of "bulk" and speed, of the system. Finally, since Descartes identifies space and matter, he denies the void; so the jostling of bits of matter packed together as a plenum creates vortices, matter flowing in circuits, which then serve as a further level of associated complexes. This version of physics afforded the first systematic competitor theory for outmoded Aristotelianism in the seventeenth century; Descartes' Principles stood as the primary physics textbook until Newton's deliberately named Principia supplanted it. Descartes' articulation of inertial motion and of a conservation law for impact are scientific develop- ments of the highest order. But his physics is also an impoverishment, primarily because it leaves out of account processes which are temporal and dynamical. Moreover, Descartes' field of geometry, so ordered, and his field of physics, so ordered, are strangely ill-suited to each other, an odd couple that doesn't really quite generate the new science. For example, the shaped volumes that are supposed to serve as the geometrical genera for specific bits of matter have no explicit place in the Geometry, which is concerned pri- marily with straight line segments and secondarily with plane curves. And even if Descartes' geometry did contain such items, deep problems concerning the coherence of associated bits of matter that run all through the Principles reveal that geometrical shape, even when taken together with common motion, is insufficient as a principle of unity for physical objects. By contrast, the straight line segments of the Geometry seem to correspond nicely to the inherently uniform, rectilinear motion of the bits of matter which are the simples in the physics. Descartes' quantified model of impact specifies that bodies in uniform recti- linear motion collide along straight lines, and that the change in their motion, to new uni- form speeds according to formulae that preserve the total quantity of what we would call momentum, is instantaneous. In this model, however, there isn't really any interesting geometrical context for the line; it is not the side of a triangle, the diagonal of a parallelo- gram or the ordinate of a curve. Just the straight line itself, along which two material par-</page><page sequence="9">245 tides bump into each other, does not bring any further mathematics into play, which might illuminate the physical situation. So far, the links between Descartes' geometry and physics seem to be missing or trivial. And yet, having stipulated that all material par- ticles are shaped volumes and that all interaction is collision and thus covered by the seven rules, Descartes appears satisfied that in principle the work of mathematizing physics is complete. (However, in his (forthcoming) Alan Gabbey argues that Descartes indeed envisaged a more complete physics, that would relate the precise microscopic phenomena of the Principles to the macroscopic world of machines, free fall, projectile motion, etc., more fully and mathematically.) What about the curves that figure in the Geometry? Descartes discusses curves in the Principles only as the trajectories of bits of matter stemming not from the nature of matter or motion, but from external exigencies imposed by the plenum: motion in a plenum can only take place, if at all, in a circuit. And the boundary condition imposed by the existence of the plenum is not strong enough to determine what precisely the curve might be, so that then the peculiar geometrical properties of that curve might be exploited in the service of physics, as Newton exploits the properties of the ellipse in Proposition XI, Book I of the Principia, where he derives the inverse square law (Motte and Cajori 1934, pp. 40-2). Moreover, Descartes' inability to focus on curves as algebraic-geometric-numerical hybrids contributes to his inability to regard curves as representative of the relations among continuously varying parameters. Nothing in Descartes' Principles is comparable to Galileo's famous analysis of projectile motion (Crew and deSalvio 1954, pp. 248-50), which takes the parabolic curve of a projectile's trajectory to express relations among time, distance, velocity and the acceleration of gravity, or to Newton's Proposition XI, where the elliptical trajectory of a point mass circling a center of force does much the same. The most significant employment of curves in early modem physics doesn't occur to Descartes. And of course some of the most important such curves were transcendental, curves which he had excluded from mathematics altogether. Descartes' organization of physics excludes the investigation of accelerated linear and curvilinear motion. The problems concerning continuously varying forces which pose such thorny and fruitful problems for his contemporaries and successors is simply avoided. Significantly, Descartes' most mathematically sophisticated attempt to quantify physics occurs in a context where the temporal and dynamic dimensions of the subject matter are irrelevant; optics is very close to a pure physical geometry, with light rays playing the roles of lines. In a sense then Descartes never makes the transition from kinematics to dynamics, as his contemporaries Galileo and Torricelli succeed in doing. For Descartes, no physical parameter, including of course what he calls "force," varies in any essential or interesting way with time, and strictly speaking bodies never accelerate. (The account of the accelera- tion due to gravity near the surface of the earth that his vortex theory provides for macro- scopic phenomena is too complicated to be quantifiable, as Descartes himself admits.) Torricelli learned from his master Galileo the importance of the parameter time in the analysis of physical situations, and develops a more sophisticated account of percussion. He argues that the percussion of a falling object exercises an infinite force accumulated in the interval of time required for its fall, because any such finite interval contains an infin- ity of instants, in each of which the body exerts the simple impulsion of its weight; this infinite accumulation is extinguished as the object struck absorbs the shock in a finite interval of time, containing an infinity of instants as well. Thus equilibrium is reestab- lished. According to Torricelli's analysis, then, each momento requires an instant of time for its generation or its extinction. Though he supposes that momenti are finite and thus their summation is infinite, he reasons about force as a continuously varying magnitude, something like an integral taken with respect to time. Moreover, as Galileo also does on other occasions, Torricelli studies the continuous accumulation of impulsions as a limit- ing case of a finite number of successive small blows. (My exposition here is indebted to</page><page sequence="10">246 DeGandt (forthcoming).) This is just the kind of reasoning Newton uses in Proposition I, Book I of the Principia, which is Newton's version of Kepler's Law of Areas (Motte and Cajori 1934, pp. 40-2). (Diagram 6) f e E d "! ""-.. E .. ". d F , . C i ' i .// ...5 X Z . :?. S A Diagram 6 The claim is: "The areas which revolving bodies describe by radii drawn to an immoveable center of force do lie in the same immovable planes, and are proportional to the times in which they are described." Newton's proof is illustrated by the figure. S is the center of force. A body proceeds on an inertial path from A to B in an interval of time; if not deflected, it would continue on in a second, equal interval of time along the virtual path Bc. However, Newton continues, "when the body is arrived at B, suppose that a centripetal force acts at once with a great impulse," so that the body does not arrive at c, but at C. Then cC ( =BV) represents the deflection of the body due to the force; indeed, cC = BV becomes the geometrical representative of the force. The perimeter ABCDEF.. represents the trajectory of the body as it is deflected at the beginning of each equal interval of time by discrete and instantaneous impulsions from S. Newton then uses the Euclidean theorem that triangles with equal bases and equal elevations have equal areas, to show that the area of triangle SAB = the area of triangle SBc = the area of trian- gle SBC; this equality extends to triangles SDC, SED, SFE... by the same reasoning, so that equal areas are described in equal times. We have only, Newton concludes, "to let the number of those triangles be augmented, and their breadth diminished in infinitum" for this result to apply to a continuously acting force and a curved trajectory. Descartes' diagram of Pappus' problem is ambiguous because his treatment of it allows it to represent not only a geometric locus, but also an algebraic equation in two unknowns. Because it can be read in both ways, both geometric and algebraic results can be brought to bear on the problem, and their combination is the key to Descartes' success. Here I would like to urge an interesting parallel between the partial unification of two mathematical domains, and of a mathematical domain and a physical domain.</page><page sequence="11">247 Newton's diagram is likewise ambiguous; it must be read both as a collection of finite lines and areas, where the perimeter is composed of rectilinear line segments, and as a col- lection of infinitesimal as well as finite lines and areas, where the perimeter is a curve. The first reading allows the application of Euclidean theorems to the problem. The second makes the diagram relevant to the kind of continuous motion and force Newton is interested in, as well as Kepler's Law of Areas. And it moreover centrally involves reasonings about propor- tions involving areas and curves, and infinitesimal lines and areas. Thus in this diagram, Newton can combine the resources of geometry and mechanics in the demonstration of a fundamental result. And when in Propositions VI and XI he builds into his diagrams the geo- metric structure of the ellipse on the one hand, and Galileo's result about free fall as well as a subtle representation of force on the other, the outcome of the combination is rich indeed. The only diagrams in Descartes' Geometry that have physical significance are the "opti- cal ovals" at the end of Book II (Smith and Latham 1954, pp. 114-149). When he discusses them in order to exhibit their optical properties, he generates them by point-wise construc- tion. Nowhere does he give an equation for one of them, though he does use algebra to dis- cuss their properties. Optics presents Descartes with a series of problems concerning the conditions under which reflected light rays, straight line segments, will converge at a given point. It's the construction of the point of convergence which interests Descartes, not the curve of the curved reflecting surface. Moreover, since for Descartes the propogation of light is instantaneous, the parameter of time doesn't enter into the conceptual situation at all. And in the Principles, none of the diagrams have any geometry that hooks up in any interesting way with the results of the Geometry. The spheres and concentric circles that show up in many of them are mathematically inert and isolated; they have none of the suggestive algebraic structure that Descartes might have conferred on them if he had been interested in curves (or surfaces) as geometrical-algebraic hybrids. Furthermore, since the vortex hypothesis doesn't specify the geometrical shape of planetary circuits, the choice of circles as representations of trajectories is arbitrary and so disconnected with the mechanical context. The spherical shape of the Cartesian corpuscles, second element matter, is likewise arbitrary and unmotivated by his physical theory. There is simply no area of overlap, accompanied by appropriately bivalent diagrams, on which Descartes' mathematics and physics can meet and mingle. The point I want to make about the geometrical-dynamical reasonings carried on by Galileo, Torricelli and Newton is that they take time as the central parameter and try to ana- lyze force as a summation of infinitesimals; their diagrams involve proportions whose terms include areas, curved lines, numbers, infinite magnitudes, and infinitesimals (lines or areas); and they use curves, sometimes transcendental, to represent the continuously varying rela- tions between physical parameters including time and force. All these aspects of their work Descartes excludes from his own, because of the strongly reductionist way in which he has restructured his geometry and physics. Thus he is never able to integrate mathematics and physics in fulfillment of the inspiring promissary note given in Part II of the Principles. References Adam, C. and Tannery, P. (eds.)
