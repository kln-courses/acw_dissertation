By Arthur Anthony Macdonell, M.A., Ph.D., F.B.A., Boden Professor of Sanskrit, University of Oxford. The literary records of India, beginning with the Rigveda, go back to an earlier date than those of any other Indo-European people ; but they supply hardly any information about chro- nology, because of the total lack of works of a historical character during the enormous period extending from the rise of Indian literature (perhaps as early as 1500 B.c.) and the begin- ning of the Mohammedan Conquest (c. 1000 A.D.). We are accordingly very largely de- pendent on archaeology in its various branches for the reconstruction of the external history of the religious and social institutions as well as of the political events of early times. The study of archaeology is, therefore, relatively more important in India than in perhaps any other country of the present day. But the ancient monuments in which so much informa- tion lies buried have been disappearing from the face of the land. Thousands have been lost for ever. Vast numbers were destroyed or mutilated by the Mohammedan invaders in bygone centuries. Many others have from time immemorial been used as quarries by neighbouring villagers. Others have fallen into irretrievable ruin simply through the ravages of time. Some antiquities of price- less value are known to have been de- stroyed within the last century. Thus the great Stiipa of Amâravatï in Southern India was standing less than one hundred years ago, but now there is hardly a trace of it left, though several of its sculptures have been rescued for museums. It is recorded that about 60 cartloads of ancient Buddhist sculp-</page><page sequence="2">March 5,1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 317 tures were removed from Sãrãnth, near Benares, and thrown into the neighbouring river to form the foundations of a new bridge about a century ago. The tower of the splendid Sun Temple at Konärak, in Orissa, was in great part still standing 70 years ago, but since then has fallen entirely ; but, as Fer- gusson, the archaeologist, says, whether from stress of weather or by aid from the Public Works Department is by no means clear. If I am not greatly mistaken, the process of destruction has even been accelerated during the past century. Much .damage has thus been done in the process of making roads, railways, and bridges. The effect of some of these operations I myself have seen. Great harm is also done, in Southern India espe- cially, by the practice of pulling down old shrines and using the materials for building new ones. I saw an example of this at Madura. Some of the blocks of the old edifice were still lying about, one of them bearing half of what was probably the most ancient inscrip- tion yet found in that part of the country. The other half had disappeared, having doubtless , been built into the wall of the new shrine. Buried sites have further been often greatly injured by the operations of untrained and irre- sponsible excavators, and innumerable sculp- tures of great archaeological value have been thus dispersed and lost. This disastrous state of things at once attracted the attention of Lord Curzon on his arrival in India as Viceroy. Without delay he proceeded to reorganise" the Archaeological Department on a permanent and systematic footing. He then, in the year 1904, passed the Ancient Monuments Preser- vation Act, by which he has conferred a benefit of the very greatest importance on India. The ancient monuments of the country are now under the direct charge of the Archaeo- logical Department. All "that survive will henceforth be carefully preserved and kept in repair. Ancient sites will no longer be at the mercy of amateur excavators. Archaeological finds will be placed in Government museums and all traffic in them put a stop to. I had many opportunities of seeing the beneficial effects of this Act during a tour of six months which I recently made in India and Ceylon, where I visited all the most important archaeo- logical remains. Of these I took many photographs and very full notes. I propose to restrict what I am going to say about these ancient monuments to what I have seen with my own eyes, excepting only a few references to later developments in other countries to which Buddhism spread from India. In the pre -Buddhistic phase of Indian religion from which Hinduism is directly descended, carved images of the gods and temples for worship were equally unknown. It is hardly to be expected that the very rudimentary art of that early age should have attempted to represent in an anthro- pomorphic form gods which were still felt to be the deifications of natural phenomena, such as sun, fire, sky, wind. And in the absence of images, structural places of worship would not be wanted. The fire and Soma ritual of this early age was conducted in an open air en- closure, or in connection with the domestic hearth. Thus, though the earliest record of Indian re- ligion, the Rigveda goes back to a very ancient date, probably 1500 B.c., Indian religion did not begin to express itself in the form of struc- tural and plastic art till a comparatively late period. For none of the architectural or sculptural antiquities which survive in India can, with one exception, be dated earlier than 260 B.c. These earliest remains are all con- nected with religion ; and the form of religion • which they illustrate is Buddhism. The one exception is a brick Stupa or relic mound at Piprahwa, on the Nepal frontier, which was explored ten years ago, and has, with proba- bility, been assigned to 450 B.c. It is with the reign of Asoka, the great Emperor (264-227 B.c.), whose rule extended practically over the whole peninsula, that the history of Indian art can really be said to begin. Originally an adherent of the Brahman religion, he became a convert to the doctrine of Buddha and devoted himself to promoting its interests, during the remainder of his life. The history of Buddhist architecture in India extends over about nine centuries, and may be divided into three roughly equal periods. The earliest period reaches from 250 B.c. to 50 A.D. The monuments which survive from this period are almost exclu- sively the work of Buddhists. It was the Buddhists who introduced the use of stone in architecture at the commencement of this period. The Buddhists, in fact, were the first who built with stone in India. For some cen- turies before the beginning of this period, the architectural use of brick had been known, as is proved by the Stûpa of Piprahwa, which, as I have already said, probably date's from 450 B.c. But the ornamental buildings of the pre-Asokan age must have been built of wood,</page><page sequence="3">31 8 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. March 5, 1909 like the modern palaces of Burma, only the substructures being made of brick. The whole history of Indian architecture points to pre- vious construction in wood, the stone monu- ments being, to a large extent, imitations of wooden models. The second, and as far as Buddhist sculpture is concerned, best period, extends roughly from A.D. 50 to 350 A.D., the third period from 350-650 A.D. The remains of Buddhist art in India are almost entirely architectural and sculptural ; sculpture practically always appears in con- nection with the architecture, and invariably in the service of religion. Early Buddhist architecture may be divided into three main groups : - (1) " Stopas," or relic mounds ; (2) " Chaityas," or places of worship, corresponding to our churches ; and (3) " Vihãras," or dwellings for the monks. I will begin with the "Stopa." This is a dome-shaped structure which was a develop- ment of the low sepulchral tumulus or mound of earth, in which baked bricks were substituted for earth with a view to durability. The purpose for which they were erected by the Buddhists . was to serve as monuments enclosing relics of Buddha or of Buddhist saints, which were placed in a stone coffer. Some, however, con- tained no relics, but were only commemorative of important events or miracles connected with the history of Buddha. I will begin my account of Buddhist archi- tecture with the Stopa, As representative of this form of structure we may take the large Stopa at Sanchi in Central India, which, dating in all probability from the third century B.c., is an example of the Asoka type. Upon a substructure consist- ing of a low circular drum a hemispherical dome was erected. This dome was surrounded by a procession path forming the1 upper rim of the drum. On the top of the dome was a box- like structure surmounted by an umbrella (the Indian emblem of sovereignty), and surrounded by a stone railing. This structure is usually called a tee (a Burmese word). The tee has disappeared from all the Indian Stopas, but its form can be seen from the Stopas surviving in Ceylon, as well as from stone models and sculptural representations preserved in great numbers in India. The Stopa itself was surrounded by a massive stone railing, with gates on four sides, enclosing a procession path and a sacred pre- cinct. Both the rails and the gates were unmistakable imitations of wooden models. The gateways, which are usually called by the Sanskrit name of Torana, were introduced into China and Japan along with Buddhist architecture from India. In China, under the name of Pailoos, they are frequently still con- structed in wood ; when made of stone they retain down to the present day the forms and details of wooden construction (like the gate- ways of Sanchi). A very remarkable thing in the history of this architectural feature is that these Pailoos are still used in China as gateways to simulated tombs just as their prototypes, the Toranas, were used at Sanchi 2,000 years ago. Buddhism was* introduced into Japan byway of Korea about 600 A.D. It is probable that the Japanese Tori-i, gateways similar in form to the Indian Toranas, and always found at the entrance of Shinto temples, are descendants of the Indian Toranas. There are similar gate- ways in Korea. The earliest Stopas were very low in pro- portion to their diameter. Thus the oldest known example, that of Piprahwa (450 B.c.), stands only about 22 feet high, with a diameter at the base of 116 feet. As time went on the relative height increased. Thus the great Stopa at Sanchi, erected some 200 years later, is 54 feet high, while the basal diameter of the dome is 106 feet. The proportional height here is just about half, while at Piprahwa it is less than one-fifth. The Stüpa of Sãrnãth, near Benares, was erected several centuries later. Here the height is no feet above the surrounding ruins and 128 feet above the plain, with a diameter of 93 feet. Thus the height is now considerably more than the diameter. In other words, the Stupa shows a tendency in course of time to assume the shape of a tower. Concurrently with the elongation of the Stopa we can see an elongation taking place in the tee also. This may be observed in chronologically successive rock - cut speci- mens at Ajanta. The combined elongation is well represented by a Stopa foundf in Cam- bodia. The next step is a further elongation of the tee with a corresponding diminution and flattening of the main body of the Stopa as shown by an example in Nepal. Here the umbrellas have disappeared and assumed the shape of thirteen roofs. In the Indian rock-cut specimens there are never more than three umbrellas, but in many of the model stone Stopas in Behar there are nine. Proceeding to Burma, we find the process going still further. In a pagoda found in Pegu, the tee is very long, though the</page><page sequence="4">March 5, 1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 319 Stüpa still remains in an attenuated form. But in another Burmese example hardly anything but the tee is left, the lower portion almost disappearing. Finally, we come to the last development in China, where the tee is practically all that is left. I do not think it would be easy to find a more remarkable example of evolution in art. The process of development, when pictorially represented in its successive stages, almost resembles that of growth in the vegetable world. Here you have an Indian architectural ornament, consisting of a few superimposed umbrellas only a few feet high, finally transformed into a nine-roofed Chinese pagoda reaching the height of 200 feet. Fer- gusson, in his " History of Eastern Archi- tecture,' ' suggests that the Chinese pagoda is derived from the Stüpa, but he nowhere tries to prove the connection, though some of the illustrations in his own work supply part of the evidence. I hope the illustrations of the suc- cessive stages which I showed when reading this paper demonstrated the connection. The Stüpa became, to the early Buddhist, the religious edifice. In the earliest sculptures we constantly find representations of it being adored by men, celestial beings, and even animals, such as elephants. It was also the sacred object always set up for worship in all the temples of early Buddhism in India. This brings me to the second class of Buddhist religious buildings, the so-called Chaityas, which are the exact counterpart of Christian churches, not only in form, but in use. Till recently only rock-cut examples, to the number of about thirty, were known in India. These enable us to understand what the interiors, at least, of these structures were like. The existence of these rock-cut temples is a great advantage for the history of archi- tecture in India, because they are still the same as when they were originally designed, some of them well over two thousand years ago, while the original form of far later struc- tural temples is often quite obscured by modifi- cations and additions. The typical Chaitya consists of a nave and side aisles, terminating in an apse or semi- dome. The pillars separating the nave from the aisles are continued round thè apse. Under the apse and in front of its pillars is the rock-cut Stùpa, nearly in the same position as that occupied by the altar in a Christian church. The tee was doubtless usually sur- mounted by a wooden umbrella, but this has everywhere disappeared except at Karli, the finest Chaitya cave in India. The wooden um- brella there was in quite a good state of pre- servation when I saw it in November, 1907. The roof of the Chaitya is semi-circular. The door is opposite the Stüpa. Over the door- way is a gallery. Above this is a large window shaped like a horse-shoe. This window is constantly repeated on the façade as an ornament. The outward appearance of the structural Chaitya was for a long time somewhat conjec- tural, though one of the monolith Hindu temples, called the Seven Pagodas,, near Madras, supplied the kej; but some recent discoveries of ancient structural Chaityas in the Bombay and Madras Presidencies have confirmed these conjectures, especially as regards their wooden origin. The excavation of these Chaityas extended from 260 B.c. to about 600 A.D., and the history of the development of their style can be followed step by step throughout these nine centuries. The oldest of them date from the time of Asoka, and are situated at Baräbar in Behar, sixteen miles north of Gayã. The most important of them is called the Lomas Rishi Cave (the Cave of the Hairy Sage). The front is carved so as to represent in rock the form of the structural Chaityas of the age. The posts, the five rafters, and the blocks at the sides are all imitations of wood. The door has also the primitive feature of jambs sloping inwards, in imitation of wooden buildings. The hall inside has a semi-circular roof. It is adorned with no kind of ornament, but the granite surface of the rock is highly polished throughout. Beyond the hall there is an almost circular apartment. This is a remarkable feature, because it repre- sents an experimental stage in rock-excava- tion. It is evidently an attempt to represent the shape of a Stüpa in the form of a hóllow chamber, instead of, as in later excavations, leaving a mass of rock at the end of the nave to be carved into a solid Stüpa. All the most important examples of Chaityas occur at six places in Western India. As we pass from the earliest to the latest specimens, we can clearly trace progress towards stone construction on the one hand, and degeneracy of cult on the other. In the oldest of these Western caves the pillars of the nave slope inwards, as in wooden structures, to resist the thrust of a circular roof. The rafters here, as well as the screen, were made of wood, but these have long since disappeared. In later specimens, the pillars of the nave and the</page><page sequence="5">320 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. March 5, 1909. jambs of the door become straight, and the screen consists of rock. At Ajanta there are four Chaityas. The second oldest of these shows a very interest- ing transition from wood to stone. For while the ribs of the vaulted roof of the náve were of wood, the ribs in the aisle are of stone, copied from wooden forms. The third Chaitya at Ajanta (No. 19) is at least four centuries later, dating proba- bly from the fifth century A.D. Here all trace of woodwork has disappeared, earlier wooden forms. being everywhere reproduced in stone. The rail ornament so common in the earlier caves has vanished, while the horse-shoe window-heads employed as a decoration on the façade are dwarfed. A striking change is the fact that figure sculpture has superseded the plainer architectural forms of the earlier caves. The greatest change, however, is this. Buddha has now been introduced in all his attitudes. Only ordinary mortals are sculptured in the earlier caves, while Buddha never appears. Now he ' is even the object of worship, his image being placed in front of the Stüpa itself, which alone was adorned in the older Chaityas. In place of the atheism of the Buddhism of an earlier age, we find ourselves here confronted with an overwhelming idolatry. In the last of the Ajanta Chaityas (No. 26) which dates from about 600 A.D., the sculp- tures are more mythological than in the previous cave, evidently approximating to the iconography of Brahmanism. We now come to the caves of Ellora, which are particularly interesting from a comparative point of view, because here we find Buddhist, Jain, and Brahman temples side by side, while the Ajanta caves are exclusively Buddhist. The large Buddhist Chaitya here appears to be of about the same age as the latest example at Ajanta, i.e., somewhere about 600 A.D. The evidence of lateness here is very mani- fest. The great horse-shoe opening is for the first time absent in the façade. Instead of it we find a small upper window, a reminiscence of the horse-shoe, with a lower and wider window, divided by two pillars, below. The end of the nave is entirely blocked by the Stüpa. The Stüpa itself, instead of being circular, has a frontispiece which makes it square on this side. This addition has a figure of Buddha seated with his feet down, and surrounded with attendants and flying figures in the latest style of Buddhist art. Finally, we have at a place called Kholvi what is probably the latest Buddhist Chaitya cave in India. The Stüpa which it contains is no longer solid, but is hollowed out into a cell in which an image of Buddha is placed. This marks the last step in the development of the Buddhist temple. A link connecting this formal stage with the later Jain and Hindu temples is to be found in an old structural Vishnu temple dating from about 700 A.D. Here the Stüpa is superseded by a cell for the image, but this cell still has a semi- circular back and is separated from the outer wall by a passage for circumambulation, which is a con- tinuation of the aisles as in the Buddhist Chaitya. The transition is completed by the next step when the cell is made square. This is the case at Pattadkal in an early Hindu temple, which is otherwise the same in plan as the one I have just described. The development of the Buddhist temples which I have just traced will show you, I think, how important archaeological evidence is for the history of Indian religion as well as architec- ture and sculpture. Showing how the Budd- hist religion gradually became idolatrous and approximated more and more to Hinduism, it makes us understand how that religion could die of inanition in India in face of the revival of Hinduism, which had absorbed much of the ethical teaching of Buddhism, and had even cometo acknowledge Buddha as one of the ten Avatars of Vishnu. Thus Buddhism, which had originally emerged from the olde- Brah- manism, again relapsed in India, after more than 1,000 years, into a later form of the same religion. Besides the structural Stùpas or their substi- tutes, the rock-cut temples, there arose Vihãras or monasteries, as residences for Buddhist monks. Our knowledge of these is still more dependent than in the case of Chaityas, on the rock-cut examples. There are about nine hun- dred Buddhist caves of this class in India, besides about one hundred belonging to the Jain and Brahman religions. According to the rock-cut specimens, the Vihãras consisted of a hall (sãlã), generally square, but sometimes oblong, surrounded by a number о cells or sleeping cubicles, and shaded by a verandah in front. The cubicles in the oldest caves usually «contain a stone bed. There is gene- rally only a single floor, but examples of two- storeyed Vihãras are not wanting. The only examples of Vihãras in Eastern India are found at Udayagiri, in Orissa. All the rest are found in Western India. Probably about forty of these were excavated</page><page sequence="6">Ma, ck s, i9o9 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 321 before the Christian era. The four most im- portant of these occur, one each at Bhãjã and Bedsa, and two at Ajanta. That at Bedsa is specially interesting because the Vihãra here has an apse, which points to this being a first attempt to excavate a Vihãra in rock, as it imitates the shape of a Chaitya. The interior of Vihãra (No. 12) at Ajanta, is adorned with seven horseshoe arches, four ever the doorways of cells, while three are simply ornamental. The second of the early Ajanta Vihãras dating from about the end of the first century B.C., is a transitional example. For here we first meet with a Vihãra ceiling supported by pillars in the centre. These are four in number. It is to be noted that in all these early Western Vihãras there is no figure sculp- ture, no reliefs, no carved emblems even. The only ornament consists of horse-shoe arches and the Buddhist rail as a string course,, with an occasional pilaster. In the Vihãras of the second period a further step is taken in construction. The number of pillars supporting the roof is increased to 12, which are arranged as a square with four on each side. This advance is always accom- panied by the degenerate feature of a sanctuary containing an image of Buddha being intro- duced in the back wall. The next step was to increase the number of pillars to 20, fhen 24, and finally 28. Nasik and Ajanta are the most interesting places for the study of Vihãras, the groups of caves in both places being purely Buddhistic. One of the principal ones (No. 3) at Nasik has a verandah with Persepolitan pillars. It has a hall 40 feet square, without pillars, and contains 16 cells. In the middle of the back wall is added the new feature of a Stüpa carved in relief. There is at Nasik another and larger Vihãra which has the still later addition, at the inner end, of a sanctuary with two richly carved pillars in front and containing within it a colossal seated Buddha with flying and standing attendants, doorkeepers, dwarfs and so forth, such as are not found till in the fifth century. Ajanta has more Buddhist Vihãras than any other place, the number being twenty-two. These are specially important as supplying a complete series of examples of Buddhist art, without any admixture from Hinduism or any other religion, extending from 200 B.c. to 600 A.D., and thus belonging to all three periods. As they contain many inscriptions the dates of the caves are fairly well known, and thus help to fix the chronology of other groups. The caves of Ellora are, however, the historically most interesting with reference to the inter-relation of the three Indian religions, Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism. For here we have side by side three groups of caves (altogether thirty-three), distinctly re- presenting those religions, while the transi- tions from one to the other can be clearly traced. Of the Buddhist group of twelve, eleven are Vihãras. The sanctuaries of most of these contain figures of Buddha seated, but with the feet down and not folded under them. Thus, the Buddhist monastery is becoming a place of worship in which figures of Buddha are ousting the monks from their cells. These Vihãras come down to about 700 A.D., at which point the earliest Brahman examples begin. There are here three two-storeyed caves which illustrate clearly the transition from Buddhism to Brahmanism. The first is en- tirely and unmistakably Buddhist. The second is similar in plan, and the sculptures are still all Buddhist, but these deviate sufficiently from the usual simplicity to have justified the Brahmans in appropriating this cave аз belonging to their religion. The third is very similar in plan to the preceding one, but the sculptures are all unmistakably Brah- man. It is evidently the earliest Brahman cave, being a close copy of the preceding Buddhist example. We have thus arrived at the beginning of the Hindu period of Indian architecture. We have seen that the Buddhists were the first builders and carvers in stone in India, beginning in the third century B.c. It is only on Buddhist monuments that we find the earliest representations of Hindu deities. Thus Lakshmï, the Hindu goddess of Fortune, worshipped by two elephants pouring water over her, appears on Bud- dhist sculptures from the second century B.c. onwards. But the oldest remains of inde- pendent Hindu art, either sculptural or archi- tectural, only date from several centuries after the beginning of our era. These considerations in themselves justify the presumption that Hindu architecture is derived from the older art of the Buddhists. This presumption is borne out by the fact that the earliest extant Hindu samples are, as I have just shown, practically identical in form with the latest Buddhist specimens, differing from these latter only in having the image of a Hindu deity,</page><page sequence="7">322 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. March 5, 1909. instead of one of Buddha, placed in the shrine. Again, at Ellora, some of the sculptures in the earliest Hindu cave temples are hardly distin- guishable from those of the latest Buddhist caves at that place. The whole surface of India is covered with Hindu temples, the vast majority quite modern or comparatively modern. The number of ancient shrines is small, chiefly in consequence of the destructive religious fury of the Moham- medans, who invaded India from 1000 A.D. onwards. The oldest specimens date from about 600 A.D., and the best examples are to be found between that date and 1300 A.D. In sur- veying these ancient monuments we can clearly distinguish two styles, each of which shows a definite type from the beginning. The geographical distribution of these two types is, to begin with, rather interesting. For the Southern or Dravidian style of Hindu architec- ture is found only within the tropics, or south of the 23rd degree of northern latitude. The Northern or Indo- Aryan style, on the other hand, is found only north of the tropic of Cancer, excepting only the eastern and western extremities of its territory, which come down to the 20th degree. A historical study of these two, moreover, shows that the Hindu temples of both styles are developments of Buddhist prototypes. But the remarkable thing is that they are respectively the descendants of two entirely distinct classes of Buddhist building ; for it can be shown that the Dravidian Hindu temple has been evolved from the Buddhist monastery, while the Indo- Aryan Hindu temple has been developed from one of the other two classes of Buddhist building. I will deal with the Dravidian temple first. The earliest representative of this type is a temple at Mahãbalipur, one of the Seven Pagodas, situated near the seashore, 35 miles south of Madras. It is a monolith, being hewn out of a single block of granite, and dates from about 600 A.D. It is clearly Brah- manic in origin, as is shown by the sculpture as well as the inscriptions. But it is evidently also a model of a Buddhist monastery of four stories. The plan is square, the pyramidal tower representing the upper storeys contain- ing the cells of the monks. The design of the regular structural Dravidian temple is a square base ornamented externally with pilas- ters, and containing the cell in which the image is kept. Over the shrine rises the sikhara, a pyramidal tower, which is always divided into storeys. This division never dis- appears in Dravidian temples. The tower is crowned with a small dome, either circular or polygonal in shape. An early example of the Dravidian style of Hindu temple on a grand scale is the Kailãsa, at Ellora, which dates from the seventh cen- tury A.D. This also is a monolith, but on an enormous scale. It is, really, one of the wonders of the world, for it is a temple carved elaborately inside and outside, out of a single huge rock left standing after a wide passage had been cut away in the hill side around it. Out of this living rock were cut shrines, porches, columns, halls, steps, galleries, roofs, and the most detailed sculptures 1,300 years ago. Much of the sculpture is still as clear as when it was first carved. It would take a large volume to illustrate fully the details of this marvellous structure. It is the culmi- nation of the art of rock- cutting in India. In front of the Dravidian temple a porch, or even two porches, may be added, but these are not an essential feature of the building. The later Dravidian temples from about 1000 A.D. stand in a large court surrounded by an enclosing wall. A special feature here is the Gopuram, or great gateway, erected in front of the shrine in the wall which encloses the court-around the temple. It has a storeyed tower, resembling that of the shrine itself. But it is oblong, not square, in shape, being twice * as wide as it is deep. The prototype of these gate- ways is the oblong monolith temple at Mahã- balipur, one of the Seven Pagodas. It is in storeys, with a waggon-headed top, the ridge being decorated with a row of ornamental vases. These have all fallen from the roof, but the bases can still be seen. The best speci- men of the structural temple in the Dravidian style is that at Tanjore, which was erected in 1025 A.D. The body of this temple is of two storeys, about 80 feet high, while the pyra- midal tower rises in eleven storeys to a total height of 190 feet. Many of the famous later temples of Southern India are architecturally a good deal spoilt by two main defects. In the first place, successive independent additions obscure the design of the original shrine, producing a sense of be- wilderment in the observer, who is unable to discover any general plan or arrangement of parts. The second defect of these later temples is the fact that the gateways in the walls of the successive courts, which have subsequently been added, increase in size and height as you proceed outwards, thus entirely obscuring the tower of the central shrine.</page><page sequence="8">March s, 1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 3*3 / Both defects are specially striking in the Srïrangam temple, near Trichinepoly, which is the largest in India. Here there is a fifth court which was added, but left unfinished, in the middle of the eighteenth century. The shrine- itself is quite insignificant, being distinguish- able only by the gilding of its dome, while the Gopurams of every court are each larger and more decorative than the preceding. Another temple in which these defects are conspicuous, though not to so excessive an extent, is the great temple at Madura. There is a fine group of earlier Hindu temples dating from the ninth century A.D., in the Dra vidian style, at a junction called Gadag on the way between Poona and Bangalore. They are conspicuous for the elaborate carving, both without and within. One of them is dedicated to SarasvatL The finest part of it is the porch, which contains some exquisitely carved pillars. Inside the cell is a figure of SarasvatI, goddess of learning. It is very difficult to obtain success- ful photographs of such images owing to the darkness of the shrine, which is lighted through a small doorway only, and is at the back of the porch. The carving on the lintels and the architrave of this particular doorway is beyond description : no chased work in silver or gold could possibly be finer. There is also a Vishnuite temple here, with a Gopuram of four storeys, and 50 feet high. About 60 miles from Gadag is situated a place which is virtually a vast open-air museum of Hindu monuments in the Dravidian style. This is Vijayanagar, the ruined capital of a Hindu kingdom, which was founded in 1 1 18, and remained a bulwark against Moham- medan invasion for two centuries and a half. The city was at last captured in 1565, and has remained deserted ever since. The ruins of palaces and temples cover an area of several miles. The travellers' bungalow itself, in which I slept, was an old Hindu temple. The finest temple here is that of Vittoba Svâmi, a form of Vishnu, erected soon after 1500 A.D. This, together with two other shrines, is surrounded by an enclosure with four Gopurams. The finest part of the main shrine is the porch, which is notable for its elaborate composite pillars and columns with richly carved figures of conventionalised animals attached to them in front. Close to this temple is to be seen in the court the stone car of the god, 26 feet high, carved out of a single block of granite. The stone used in all the buildings at Vijayanagar is granite, and the enormous size of the slabs used is very remarkable. A walk of rather over a mile brings one to the great temple of Siva (under the name of Pampãpati Svãmi). This temple is in use, as there is a small village called Hampi close to it. It has a great Gopuram at the north entrance. Taken in all its dimensions (being over 165 feet high) this gateway is, perhaps, the largest in India. A few hundred yards from this great temple are two vastly solid shrines, built of granite, of the elephant-headed god Ganesa, containing idols of that deity, one 10 feet and the other 18 feet high. There are many other interesting ancient monuments on this vast site, but it is impossible for me to dwell on them any longer. To each of the great temples of Southern India is attached a large tank for the religious ablutions of the worshippers. Some of them are picturesque, such as that in the great temple at Srïrangam, near Trichinopoly. Sacred tanks not within the precincts of a temple are also frequent in Southern India. These are called Teppa kulam, or raft tanks, with a small shrine in the centre, to which at certain festivals the image of the god is taken across on a raft. There is a great Teppa kulam at Madura, in which the central island is adorned with a pyramidal Dravidian tower in the middle and four small pavilions at the corners. One of the features of the Madura and othoř great South Indian temples are the colonnades which surround the tanks. In the colonnade of the Madura temple I witnessed the recitation of the Mahãbhãrata, the great Sanskrit epic, which is a kind of moral encyclopaedia to the Hindu. Each Sanskrit verse was expounded in Tamil by the Brahman reciter to the crowd of natives who squatted around him. Other South Indian temples have colonnades around their court. This is the case in the great Siva temple at Vellore, not far from Madras. It is one of the most remark- able shrines in South India. It has a Gopuram, seven - storeyed, and 100 feet high. The colonnade which runs round the enclosure, is supported by nearly 100 carved pillars. There is a remarkable stone pavilion in the left hand corner of the enclosure as you enter, the ceiling and the pillars being most exquisitely carved. Here I must add a few words about the columns •f the South Indian style. The early Dravidian temples had conventional lions and elephants of normal shape as supports of their pillars. These were gradually enlarged and affixed to the</page><page sequence="9">324 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. March 5, 1909. pillars, as at Madura ; the animal forms being conventionalised with riders. Human and other figures were then introduced as supporters, for example, in the Srirangam temple, near Trichinopoly, where the ornament becomes altogether excessive. One of the most sacred shrines of India, which has been for centuries the goal of pil- grimages from all parts of India, is- the great temple of Rämesvara, sacred to Rama, situated on an island close to the mainland, in the channel between South India and Ceylon. It has a magnificent Gopuram. Its most striking feature, however, is the wonderful corridors which adorn it. The south corridor is 700 feet in length, that is to say, it is the longest in the world excepting that in the Vatican. A variety of the Dravidian style is that which has been called the Chãlukyan by Fergusson, after the dynasty which ruled from about 400 A.D. onwards in the territory where this variety prevails. It embraces the northern and the north-western part of the region covered by the southern style of architecture. The peculiari- ties of this style are these. The ground plan is star-shaped, and the tower is stepped rather than storeyed, forming a square pyramid with breaks corresponding to the angles in the walls. The temples generally stand on a terrace from 10 feet to 15 feet wide, and 3 feet to 6 feet high, a feature which adds very greatly to their architectural effect. The best examples belong to the period between 11 20 and 1270 A.D. .The most perfectly preserved example is the temple of Somnãthpur, about twenty miles from Mysore city. The buildings were erected without mor- tar, the joints being carefully fitted. The details of this style are very elaborate, most of the finer temples being overlaid with sculptural ornament, consisting of floral patterns inter- mixed with mythological figures. Another fine Chãlukyan temple is that at Belur, dating from 1 120 A.D., and situated in a remote part of the State of Mysore. In it may be seen the best specimens of the perforated stone windows which are one of the special features of this style. Bift the most attractive of all the Chã- lukyan shrines is the great temple of Siva at Halebïd, about twenty miles from Belur, delightfully situated on a terrace near the shores of a lake. It was left unfinished in the year 1270 A.D., the towers never having been added. It is one of the most remarkable monuments in India. One of the pavilions in front contains a huge image of the Bull of Siva. In the interior are some remarkable black stone pillars, which look as if they had been turned in a lathe. This temple is unmatched in the variety of its details and the exuberance of fancy shown in its ornamentation. There is, perhaps, no other temple in the world on the outside carving of which such a marvellous amount of labour has been spent. It will give some idea of the enormous amount of sculp- ture with which this temple is covered when I mention the fact that the lowest band of the frieze alone contains a procession of about 2,000 elephants, no two of which exactly resemble each other. Now let us turn to the Indo- Aryan style of Hindu architecture. By great good fortune there are extant side by side two of the earliest examples of the Dravidian and Indo- Aryan styles near a place called Badãmi, in the Chãlu- kyan territory. They date from the end of the sixth century A.D., and already show fully developed the characteristic features which the two styles clearly retain down to the present day. Both have a square base containing the cell, but while the Dravidian temple has a pyramidal tower, always divided horizontally into storeys, the Northern tower is a curvilinear spire, not divided into horizontal storeys, but, on the contrary, having a vertical band run- ning up each face. While the Dravidian tower is surmounted by a small round or polygonal dome, the Indo-Aryan tower is surmounted by a circular fluted ornament,- somewhat flattened at the top. The Indo-Aryan, like the Dravidian shrine, has a porch nearly always added in front of the entrance to the cell, but it was evidently not essential, not being an integral part of the edifice. The shrine itself consists of two parts. The lower part containing the. cell is square. It rises from a moulded plinth and ends in a cornice. There are never any pillars or pilasters (as in the lower part of the Dravidian shrine). Above this rises the spire, which is square in section, and the curve of which in the early specimens begins near the top. The central vertical band was carved, usually with a reticulated orna- ment composed of minute arches. The Mandapam, ór porch, is added in front of the doorway of the cell, and is square, being of the same height as the top of the shrine where the spire begins. In the earliest specimens there were no pillars, and the roofs consisted of long sloping slabs. Later, columns were introduced in groups of four, and courses of masonry were made outside to correspond to the carved conical roof inside. The earliest representatives of the Indo-</page><page sequence="10">March 5, 1909. ' JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 325 Aryan style are found in the group of deserted Hindu temples at Bhuvanesvar in Orissa, about 250 miles south of Calcutta. The older and finer specimens begin from about 600 A.D., the series coming down to about 1100 A.D. They show this style in its greatest purity, and probably furnish better material for the history of this form of Hindu art than any other temples in India. To the ninth century belongs the celebrated Black Pagoda, a temple of the Sun, at Konã- rak, in Orissa, about 20 miles from Pun, and within sight of the sea. It represents the car of the Sun drawn by seven horses, with twelve gigantic, elaborately carved wheels of stone on each side. For its size, it is, on the outside at least, the most richly ornamented building in the world. There are several figures of the Sun-god carved on the outside. Next in chronological order comes the large group of Hindu temples at Khajräho in Central India, dating from between 900 and 1200 A.D. The older ones are covered, inside and outside, with the most elaborate sculp- tures. They are shrines of either Vishnu or Siva. This is, on the whole, probably the finest group of temples in India. A feature in the evolution of this style is that the number of porches is gradually increased to four. The famous shrine of Jagannãth, the lord of the world, a name of Vishnu, was erected about the year 1200 A.D. Within its en- closing wall, which is about 20 feet high, are crowded together something like 130 shrines. Pun is a great place of pilgrimage from all parts of India, but the great crowd of pilgrims assembles at the car festival in June and July. The great car, which is 45 feet high and 35 feet square, is then, with the image of the god placed on it, dragged from the temple to the garden house of the god, situated at a distance of about a mile. In pulling the great car and two lesser cars along, a throng of more than 4,000 professionals are employed. After the festival, these wooden cars are broken up ánd the fragments dis- tributed to pilgrims. Puri was in all likelihood the original place where the famous tooth relic of Buddha was worshipped in very early times, and there are various facts connected with the temple which point to a Buddhist background. Thus when pilgrims eat the sacred food within the precincts of the temple, all caste distinctions disappear. The highest Brahman would then take food from the hands of a man of the very lowest caste : a thing otherwise impossible in India. The origin of the Indo-Aryan spire has always been a puzzle to Eastern archaeologists. Thus Fergusson, the great authority on thé subject of Eastern architecture (p. 412) says • - " Neither the pyramid nor the tumulus affords any suggestion as to the origin of the form, nor the tower, either square or circular ; nor does any form of civil or domestic architecture. It does not seem tobe derived from any of these.' ' Here, then, we are faced with a fascinating problem. We have already seen that the Indo-Aryan Hindu spire appears fully de- veloped in its earliest occurrence, about 600 A.D., beside the Dravidian Hindu pyramidal tower. It has clearly no connection with that tower. But it can still less be a development of the Buddhist Chaitya or church, with its wagon-headed roof and semicircular apse at the end, which shows no suggestion of anything like a spire about it. Where then are we to look for its source ? I believe the answer can be given with cer- tainty, or at least a high degree of pro- bability ; and although I cannot here adduce all the evidence, I think I can supply enough to establish the correctness of the conclusion. I have shown how the Buddhist Stupa in the cave temples gradually developed from a plain solid dome into an elongated hollow cell con- taining an image of Buddha. The transition from the solid to the hollow Stüpa is further illustrated by model Stüpas at Bodh Gayã. Then we find near Badami an old structural Hindu temple of Vishnu dating from the seventh century A.D., containing a similar hollow cell for the image, the back of the cell being still semi-circular. In that neighbourhood we find another old Hindu temple, the same in other respects, the only difference being that the cell has become square. Now, there are to be found in Northern India a number of simple Indo-Aryan shrines erected without porches. These evidently bear a strong resemblance to the transformed hollow Stüpa. In place of the original round drum you have the square base, as more suitable in form for a cell. Above this rises the spire in place of the elongated dome, and still retaining the vertical curve of the latter, but modifying its circular shape by carrying the corners of the square base to the top. Thus the horizontal section of the spire becomes square also. Finally comes the explanation of the orna- ment at the top of the spire. I think we may dismiss the theory that the fluting is an imita- tion of a certain small Indian fruit. In the earliest examples of Indo-Aryan temples there</page><page sequence="11">326 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. Match s, 1909. is a neck between the top of the spire and the ! ornament. One of the rock- cut Stüpas at Ellora indicates that the neck represents the lowest part of the tee, and the ornament above represents the upper part, the fluting being a rounded modification of the vertical divisions in the tee. The curved flattened top probably represents a single umbrella. In one of the rock-cut Stüpas at Ajanta, the three umbrellas carved in stone above the tee are themselves fluted. These in turn are surmounted by the vase-shaped finial which regularly appears at the top of the Indo- Aryan spire. Thus we arrive at the remarkable con- clusion that, while the Southern Hindu temple has been evolved from the Buddhist monastery, not only Buddhist temple architecture outside India, but also Hindu temple architecture throughout Northern India, is a development of the Buddhist Stüpa. In the Northern Hindu temple the dome of the Stüpa was elongated, while the umbrella ornament be- came attenuated. Outside India the dome was gradually attenuated till it finally disap- peared, while the umbrella ornament grew to such an extent that it finally became a tower 200 feet in height. With the red thread of historical study to guide us, we are thus enabled to understand clearly what otherwise presents itself as an inexplicable mass of dis- connected phenomena in the domain of early Indian architecture. DISCUSSION. The Chairman (Sir Richard Temple, Bart., C.I.E.), in opening the discussion, said he was sure all present would agree with him in congratulating the reader of the paper on the illuminating address he had delivered. As time was exceedingly short, he proposed to limit himself to one or two points which were of special interest to him, the first being the author's description of the development of the form of the Stupa into the modern Far Eastern pagoda. About 20 years ago, he (the Chairman) lectured upon that subject at the Royal Anthropological Institute, re- ferring to the identical points that the author had men- tioned ; and he was glad to be able to support Prof. Macdonell in his statement that the modern pagoda arose out of the elongated tee of the original Stüpa. But in his lecture he added another point, namely, that there was a double elongation. There was in the Indian pagodas what was called the aonla, or amalaka, ornament, and the present form of the Burmese pagoda was an elongation of both the tee and that aonla ornament. He was also able to show n that lecture that the many-storeyed and roofed buildings of China were developments of the tee. His lecture was never published, owing to his not fulfilling the promise he made at the time that it should be; but he still had the paper, and it would be a great pleasure to him to hand it over to Prof. Macdonell, if it would be of any use to him in the book which they all hoped would come out of the paper. The author mentioned another point of great interest to those who had had to study Buddhist architecture in the Far East, when he stated, in describing the caves of Ellora, that the Buddhist monastery became a place of worship in which the figures of Buddha were ousting monks from their cells. That remark," he thought, illus- trated the existence of certain well-known rock sculptures, opposite Prome, in Burma, which other- wise seemed to have no meaning at all, and it also explained the ornamentation of the caves in Southern Burma, both inside and outside, which consisted of a large number of very small shrines with nothing but the Buddha in them. It was very inter- esting to think that that ornamentation was originated by the monk in his cell. There was an elaborate paper by himself on that particular point in the &lt;ť Indian Antiquary " of about fifteen years ago, called " The Antiquities of Ramannadesa," which meant the lower districts of Burma, Rangoon, and so on. The most valuable part of the paper was that in which the author showed that the modern Hindu architecture, both northern and southern, arose out of the Buddhist architecture. That was new to him (the Chairman), and, he believed, to most of those present, and it would be extremely interesting to see how that subject would be followed up. Sir George "Watt, C.I.E., M.B., LL.D., having thanked the author for the admirable paper he had delivered, said he had always felt that a mistake had been made by some writers on the subject. They started, as the author had done, with Buddhism, but he had a strong conviction that they might go back a good deal further, and perhaps the defect of the paper was in that direction. If the author had gone up into the hills, and studied the aboriginal temples which were everywhere to be seen, he thought he would have recognised the prototype of a good many of the Buddhist monuments. He was quite aware that the 4 Buddhists were the first people to use stone, who excavated temples, and later on built them ; hence writers on this subject could not help themselves very well in dealing with the Buddhists, because all the older temples had necessarily disappeared, having been made of wood. But he thought we were justified in looking at the temples that existed, although they were recent, in order to see whether from them we could get any conception of the source whence the Buddhists derived their great conception. As the author said, the Chaitya exactly represented a portion of a Christian church. The processional passage was an exceedingly important feature of most Buddhist monuments. It would be in-</page><page sequence="12">March 5, 1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 327 teresting to know where they got their conception of a church (Chaitya, or assembly-hall), consisting of three galleries, .a central nave and two side aisles. It suddenly appeared in the great temples at Ajanta, Karli, and Ellora, but where did it come from ? Personally he thought it came from a former religion and architecture, and that previous architecture was, in his mind, present in the little temples that one saw everywhere throughout India. By looking at the temple at Simla, near the brewery, one might regard it as the prototype of the great and wonderful Buddhist architecture. It consisted of a hall with a double-angled roof and pillars sup- porting the» bent roof, and dividing the whole into three sections, a central nave and two aisles. Going to the end, it would be found that over the temple there was placed a curious box-like structure, and over that was thrown an umbrella, exactly like the tee to which the author had referred. He thought a mistake was often made in regarding the Aryans, the Nature- worshippers who invaded India, as having necessarily founded all the Hindu religion, architec- ture, and arts. He believed that, while the Aryans were in India and were Nature- worshippers, they needed neither idols nor temples, but he did not think that that of necessity involved that there were no temples and no idols before the Aryan conquests. He believed, at all events, that many of the temples he spoke of had idols, some were very beautiful, but they were not Hindu or Buddhist. It was known, as a matter ofsfact, that when the Aryan faith began to degenerate, it did so by absorbing the aboriginal faiths, some of which still lived. The author alluded to a carving of Lakshmi, the goddess of Fortune, with the elephants pouring water over it. That sculpture went back to perhaps to 150 b.c., and if it was a Hindu idol it was, perhaps, the oldest one ►known.* Mr. R. Sewell said he found himself in cordial agreement with the author on almost every point upon which he had touched. The author had referred to the origin of South Indian architecture lying in the Buddhist Chaitya, while the Northern architecture was derived from the Buddhist Vihara. The Vihara in the Buddhist stone sculptures was undoubtedly derived from wooden forms, showing, in successive storeys, terraces surrounded by the cells for the monks. Those cells could be traced century after century through the entire range of Hindu archi tecture down to the present day. The earliest specimens, in South India, with which he was acquainted were at the Seven Pagodas, and at Conjeveram where, on the terraces of the low square towers, the cells were quite separated from one another, each storey being distinctly smaller than the one below it. A little later, the whole structure became a low tower, the cells joining one another and forming a wall ; gradually, as years went on, the tower increased in height, and the storeys were * See also the letter from Sir George Watt on p. 328. joined, the upper to th^ lower. The tower then became a structure of great height, on a small base, still bearing the representation of the old cells, but in very low relief. Colonel T. H. Hendley, C.I.E., desired to en- quire of Sir George Watt whether many of the pagodas in the hills were not forced upon the hill people by the Nepalese, and, therefore, whether they were not, to a certain extent, Buddhist, having been derived from the architecture of the plains. It was, no doubt, well-known that constant repetition of old forms went on from age to age, and that the wooden structures in the hills might represent some aboriginal type. He was not sure, however, that it could be argued from that that the aborigines had constructed buildings, which were not of the rudest character, in any part of India, and still less so in the hills. The photographs the author had shown recalled to his mind the fact that in and about Jaipur in Raj putaña there were temples of all kinds in the styles of South India, Bengal, or even the hills, which owed their origin to architects of patrons whose business or pilgrimage had made them familiar with distant places. In this way some confusion of styles occurred. He wished to ask the author also whether he had referred sufficiently to the Jains. Did he think their architecture was derived from the Buddhists, or was peculiar to them, seeing that it was generally held that their faith was as old as, if not older than, that of Buddha ? He agreed with the Chairman that there had been a gradual development from age to age, and, as an example, reminded the author of the famous Jain tower, dating from the ninth century of our era, in the Chittur Hill, which had undoubtedly served as a model for the still more beautiful structure not far from it - namely, the Tower of Fame of Rana Kambhu, which was erected in the fifteenth century. The Chairman said that, on behalf of himself and other humble students of the particular subject under discussion and of Buddhism, he wished to reply shortly to Sir George Watt's remarks. Had he thought there would have been sufficient time, he would have brought out the point that, in the earliest Buddhist sculptures which were known, they had not by any means reached the beginning of things, because the sculpture showed such an immense advance in art that there must be a long history before them. He did not know that the writers upon that particu- lar point had made a mistake in supposing that there was not an aboriginal origin, at any rate in part, for Buddhism, because a year or two ago he produced quite an elaborate book showing that Buddhism had, to a very considerable extent, arisen out of the beliefs ' of the people, but that those beliefs were not what was now known as modern Hinduism. Professor Macdonell, in reply, said he was very glad to hear that the Chairman had so much material in his possession which would corroborate some of</page><page sequence="13">328 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. March 5, 1909. the conclusions to which hç (the speaker) had come with regard to the origin of the pagoda, espe- cially details with which he was not acquainted. With regard to the question of the origin of Buddhist architecture, he thought there must be a great deal that was based on pre - Buddhistic or aboriginal sources. For instance, it could probably be shown that the wagon-headed Chai ty as had been con- structed in imitation of aboriginal thatched wooden buildings which still existed in India. There was a description, in a book colled " Glimpses of India,' ' of such native buildings somewhere in the South, which were almost exactly like Chaityas in shape. With regard to the question of the use of idols, he thought it was highly probable that idolatry prevailed extensively in ancient India among the aborigines, but it was very difficult to believe that the very primitive idols which existed could have exercised any influence on the highly-artistic sculptured images of Buddhism. As far as the evidence went, these were all started by the Grseco-Buddhistic art of the North- west, from which it spread to every other part of India, and to the rest of the Buddhistic world. Very likely the aboriginal worship of idols encouraged the use of images in Buddhism, which originally re- jected all worship of idols. Nevertheless Buddha afterwards became deified himself, and was one of the most frequent idols to be found any- where. He thought it was important to try to discover what aboriginal influence had taken place in Buddhism and Hinduism, which was one of the difficulties of the study of those religions. It was known, for instance, that Hinduism had ab- sorbed a great deal from aboriginal religions, such as that of snake worship, which the Aryans appeared not to have known in the earliest times. Another example was Linga worship. He quite agreed with Sir George Watt that it was important to study that aspect, and not to suppose that Buddhist art started from a tabula rasa. He thought the Jain temple architecture could be shown to be a develop- ment of Hindu and not of Buddhist architecture. The Western Jain style was altogether based on the Northern or Indo- Aryan style. The porch was the special development which had separated the Jain architecture from the ordinary Indo- Aryan style, but the tower which was used in Jain temples above the cell was still Indo- Aryan. It was difficult to treat these questions in a connected way without having thought them out first, so that he would rathér riot make any furthur remarks at the present time. On the motion of the Chairman, a hearty vote of thanks was accorded to the author for his valuable paper, and the meeting terminated: Sir George Watt writes : - When I was called upon to speak, the other day, on Professor MacdonelPs suggestive and interesting paper on "The Buddhist and Hindu Architecture of India," there was a feeling clearly shown by the audience that no time had been left for discussion,- In consequence I felt that I could only venture to speak for a very few minutes, and I am afraid what I did say but very imperfectly conveyed my meaning. Perhaps, therefore, I may be permitted to amplify my observations by this letter. In the first place, I think that a mistake may be made by writers on Buddhist architecture when they assume that we are not justified in going further back than to the time when the existing Stupas and cave temples were constructed or excavated. I admit at once that we can point to no actual existing monu- ments of a pre -Buddhistic period. But is that indispensable ? Professor Macdonell says i - " In the pre -Buddhistic phase of Indian religion, from which Hinduism is directly descended, carved images of the gods and temples for worship were equally un- known. It is hardly to be expected that the very rudi- mentary art of that early age should have attempted to represent in an anthropomorphic form gods which were stijl felt to be the deifications of natural pheno- mena, such as sun, fire, sky, wind. And in the absence of images architectural places of worship would not be wanted." To investigate the issues there raised, however, it seems quite beside the point to discuss the religion of the Rig-veda or of the Yajur-veda, since we are, so far as the Vedas are concerned, interested in the time when the Atharvan was written - the Veda of the Magadha- if not of the Brahmanas. The religion there set forth may, I think, be spoken of as a combina- tion of a degraded Nature worship taken from the early Vedas with the idolatry of the aborigines - Brah- manism. The old pantheon had beeñ extended by the admission of earthly gods, spirits, and demons. In other words, with the Brahmanical elaborations of cults came sectarian gods, until, as Dr. Hopkins says, man had subdued the gods and himself become God. For the mass of the people the future was hopeless ; the misery of other existences could alone be mitigated by sacrifice. Thus it may be truly said that the time was ripe for revolt, and two schisms appeared - Buddhism and Jainism. The former took its birth in the lower Himalaya, skirting Oudh, and attained its complete conception in Bihar. It seems thus a little unsafe to assume the absence of images and temples in the period when Buddhism appeared. As a matter of fact, the Stupas, with their rails and gateways, are often richly decorated, both by scenes from the domestic life of the people of India 2,000 years ago and by symbols that must be accepted as denoting some features, at least, of the irreligion. The similarity of the Stupas of the Jains with those of the Buddhists is, moreover, a point of great interest, indicating very possibly that the con- ception of relic worship came to both schisms from an early and common faith. Thus, for example, the Sanchi gateway (which probably dates from 150 B.c.), gives us a vivid representation of Lakshmi (the Goddess of Wealth, and in late mythology a consort of Vishnu). All over that wonderfully interesting</page><page sequence="14">March 5, 1909. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 329 monument there are other symbols of a very remark- able kind. The dagaba (Stupa or relic chamber), the chakra (or wheel, dharma , or book of the law), and sangha (the tree or congregation- the brotherhood) are in profusion. And these have been identified by some writers on this subject as the symbols of the trinity of Buddhism. So again the serpent (more especially at Amarãvati) appears not infrequently and has been accepted as an emblem of Buddha, though a five- headed cobra is in very general association with Vishnu. Lastly, we have the trident ( trisul ) shown in the most prominent fashion, a symbol which by certain Hindus is supposed to belong to Vishnu. Before rejecting these and other such symbols as having come into Buddhism from pre-existing faiths, one would like to obtain direct evidence of their having been invented and authorised to portray specific doc- trines of the Buddhism as preached by its founder. But the contrast between Sanchi and Ajanta is, to say the least of it, very striking. There is an infinitely closer resemblance between the remains of the Jaina rail at Muttra and that of Sanchi than can be traced anywhere in connection with the Chaitya and Virhara excavations. But for the fact that the Stupa and its rail have become sacred emblems, the symbolism of Sanchi and of all the other topes may be said to have been entirely discontined with the appearance of the assembly halls and monasteries, excavated out of the rock. Can this be viewed as a reformation in the faith (the rejection of all trace of early idolatry), and the birth of the complete con- ception of Buddhist atheism ? Whatever it means, the change which took place had a most remarkable influence on Buddhist art and architecture. The Stupa was placed within the assembly-hall, the pro- cessional path around and behind the Stupa, or altar, gave origin very possibly to the aisles and apse, while the nave became the place for the brother- hood of monks, who conducted the service, just as may be seen to this day in the Lamasaries of Sikkim. Thus it may be said the symbolic faith, portrayed on Sanchi, gives the impression, not so much of the birth of a new religion and of new art inspira- tions, as the mortuary of ancient aspirations. In other words, the transition from the sepulchral atmosphere of Sanchi to the vigour of silent Ajanta, leaves the impression of a chronicle of pre- Buddhist traditions and beliefs combined with the childhood of a new faith. These are contrasted with the manhood, decline, and death, shown at Ajanta - a university one might call it - of that new faith, Buddhism. So again the last stages, as recorded in India, mark the return to aboriginal beliefs, the reversion from an impersonal and abstract spirituality to a personal deity. But I have trespassed far beyond the space that can be afforded me. I had intended to discuss in the second place, the impression of architecture conveyed to the mind by a study of the Buddhist monuments of India. The sudden appearance of the Chaityas is, perhaps, one of the most surprising features of this subject. Where did that conception come from ? It points very conclusively to a knowledge having existed in the construction of assembly hall in wood, for many centuries prior to the idea having been ob- tained of the desirability of excavating these out of the solid rock. I repeat the suggestion made by Fergusson that it seems likely some of the primitive hill temples, in the country adjacent to where Buddhism originated, may preserve to us the original conception. I believe this is so, but (be that as it may) the skill that excavated such temples as Karléi can hardly be described as a " very rudi- mentary art," whatever that art may have been in pre-Buddhist tirçies. It is doubtful if any country in the world, at the period in quest ion y possessed a very much more perfect knowledge than the Buddhist excavators. Professor Macdonell goes into great detail on the origin of the Chinese pagoda and of the Indo- Aryan temple. I am sorry to say I do not regard his re- marks on these subjects as the most valuable portions of his paper. He says, for example, that Fergusson in his " History of Eastern Architecture," suggests that the Chinese pagoda is derived from the Stupa, but that he nowhere tries to prove the connection, though some of tbe illustrations in his own work supply part of the evidence. I am afraid I' can hardly agree with that statement. In his " Rock-cut Temples " (p. 27), speaking of cave 19 at Ajanta, Fergusson observes, "The upper part of the daghopa is also seen with its three umbrellas, but these have departed still further from their wooden prototypes and are fast approach- ing those forms which give rise to the three, six, and nine-storied towers of the Jains and which are still built at the present day in China. The connection between the porcelain tower at Nankin and a hemi- spherical dome surmounted by a wooden umbrella is certainly not at first sight apparent ; but there are few things more clear than that the one is tbe direct lineal descendant of the other and every step of the change can be pointed out." It is necessary to read the whole of Fergusson' s works before one can be quitq dogmatic in affirming that he has not observed this and that aspect of Indian architecture. Few subjects of importance escaped his observation .</page></plain_text>
