<plain_text><page sequence="1">PART 2, 1982 Supernature Etiologies of Illness in Central Northern Borneo by Peter Metcalf Among the Berawan of the lower Bárám l, as among other peoples of the area, there has been little resistence to the introduction by government agencies of western techniques of medicine. This despite a continuing adherence to largely supernatural ideas concerning the etiology of illness. Supernatural causes continue to be seen as the root of medical problems, while industrially produced drugs are seen as effective in the treatment of symptoms. It is because the traditional etiologies constitute a classification of causes of affliction, rather than of diseases, that this integration is possible. This paper shows how it is achieved by describing the action of the supernatural etiologies. It is offered as a footnote to J.M. Elshouťs pioneer study in medical anthropology Over de Geneeskunde der Kenja-Dajak in Central Borneo in Verband met hunnen Gods dienst (1923). Afflictions attributed solely to physical causes Some common complaints are attributed to the physical environment without any kind of supernatural participation. For example, the fungal skin diseases that are contracted while working in the farms, especially at harvest time, are though to be the purely physical result of fine cuts that the workers' hands suffer from the sharp leaves. Other examples are tropical ulcers and stomach upsets. The Berawan are very cleanly; they like to bathe freqently and after working in the sun they are embarrassed to engage in any king of social interaction until they have washed. Even so, it is next to impossible in the conditions of upriver life to prevent small cuts or skin abrasions from sometimes becoming infected. On the feet and ankles it is especially hard to keep small wounds clean, even with liberal use of antiseptic and sticking plaster, and ulcers result. Berawan regard tropical ulcers as an inconvenience of everyday life, like mosquitoes, and attribute no other causality to them. Stomach upsets have a more interesting etiology. They may, in the Berawan view, be nothing more than the result of eating rotten food or drinking polluted water. But it may alternatively be the result of deliberate poisoning, and some people are thought to be skilled at preparing poisons. If an adult suddenly falls ill with diarrhea and vomiting, then foul play will be suspected. The shaman may be summoned, but his task is to identify the evil-doer, not produce a cure. Even shamans themselves are vulnerable, because their skills are only useful against supernatural attack. The death of an influential shaman was explained in just this way. The man had led a checkered political career, and he had many enemies in his own and neighboring communities. So when he fell violently ill after a social gathering, poison was the obvious conclusion, and it was confirmed by the convulsions that he suffered before dieing. At the onset of his illness he was able calmly to announce who his poisoner was, and what the course of the illness would П5</page><page sequence="2">PETER METCALF JMBRAS VOL. 55 be, but not to reverse it. A wave of serious dysentry cases within a longhouse can cause disruptive paranoia, and in these contexts I have seen a shaman act so as to reduce tension. The most respected Berawan shaman on one occasion spent a week going from room to room conducting his seance for one sick person after another, and announcing firmly that there was no poisoning involved. Normally Berawan do not suspect the members of their own community, but they are wary in the houses of some of their non-Berawan neighbours. For the treatment of conditions where no supernatural cause is thought to be involved, the Berawan have a body of herbal remedies. Formerly, there were individuals that were in demand because of their skill in it, but nowadays little of this traditional lore remains. Western medicine has largely replaced it, being regarded as similar, but of superior effectiveness. What Western medicine means to the Berawan is largely pills obtained from hospitals in downriver townships or from the Upriver Dresser, a paramedic who travels by canoe in the interior. The parallel between these medicines and traditional herbal cures is close. Berawan say that their present- day knowledge is greatly inferior to that of the ancestors, who knew the jungle more intimately and enjoyed a closer harmony with nature. One man had an ingenious theory; he attributed the decline in the skill of local healers to the fact that men now usually carry a flashlight along when they go hunting at night. These lights scare away tne jungle spirits who previously were willing to approach and communicate useful information. In this way, he expressed clearly that acculturation had given something and simultaneously taken something away. "Not knowing the jungle" becomes a metaphor of modernisation, and by an interesting logical inversion, Westerners are seen as "knowing the jungle" because they manufacture powerful medicines. People often asserted that I was a skilled jungle savant. Faced with embarrassingly frequent evidence to the contrary, they merely commented that, of course, the jungle was different in my country. For the many types of affliction that are ascribed to supernatural agencies, there are two possible etiologies. The first has to do with breach of a tabu, the second with soul loss. Berawan are often unsure whether a medical problem is of one type or the other, and may use a shaman or a divinatory technique in order to answer that question first. Elsewhere I have published the text of an address made to the major omen bird, who was summoned in order to discover the nature of the illness troubling the augur's grandchild (Metcalf 1976:119-23). It was an odd condition, one very disturbing to the Berawan. It involved the infant having mild fits. The augural bird was urged to appear and to show by its flight, whether moving off to the left, or right, or directly away from the observers, which of three causes was operative: Troubled by a ghost of the recently dead, or by some other spiritual agency (both involving soul loss), or breach of tabu by the parents. Having obtained a diagnosis, the grandfather knew how to go about effecting a cure. States of ritual danger The most clear-cut affliction that is caused by breach of tabu is difficulty in childbirth. Even more than the prospective mother, the father is hedged about by 116</page><page sequence="3">PART 2, 1982 SUPERNATURAL ETIOLOGIES prohibitions. The list of acts that are proscribed (nileng) seems to be endless, and I discovered new ones on every occasion that a difficult delivery occurred, as the husband's actions were scrutinised for infractions previously overlooked. That there are so many is a reflection of the anxiety that Berawan feel, not only about the death of young children, but also of the death of a woman in childbirth. The latter is viewed with great horror. In most cases the symbolism of the prohibitions is evident. They fall into two classes: The most numerous are those that somehow involve symbolically stopping up the birth canal; the remainder mostly have to do with avoiding animals that have anthropomorphic characteristics, lest the mother or child somehow resemble the tabued creature. Here are a few examples of the former type: 1. The husband must not tie anything up, or nail things together. A moments reflection will show how laborious a scrupulous observation of this rule might be. Even to tie up a canoe's painter is an infraction. It should be merely pulled up the bank - with the attendant risk of loss if the river should rise. If the husband must undertake a piece of construction, such as building a farm house, then he first builds a small replica of the structure, and when the real house is finished he dismantles the model, calling on the Creator Spirit to let that act undo all the prior acts of fastening or nailing. Or alternatively one nail will be ritually hammered in at the outset, and one knot tied, and these will be made to stand for all the other such acts, when they are pulled out or undone at the conclusion. This broad prohibition is capable of many analogical extensions. One man at Long Teru frantically dismantled his ancient outboard motor while his wife was in labor. He had carefully assembled it only days before, and got it running, but he felt that the act of fastening nuts and bolts was too much like tieing knots for his peace of mind, so he took it all apart again. 2. The husband may not walk in a swamp, where it is difficult to withdraw one's feet from the mud because of suction. 3. The husband must not drive a pole into the stream bed, as is normally done to make an anchor for a canoe. It is very hard to pull them out of the mud again. 4. If the husband enters a room of the longhouse, he must leave by the same door. 5. The pregnant wife must not sew patches onto her husband's clothes. 6. Neither husband nor wife may dam a stream in order to catch fish. 7. The husband and wife can only use firewood from trees that, when cut, fell directly to the ground and did not become entangled in adjacent trees. As examples of the second type: 1. The husband should not fish for, nor the wife eat, a fish of the species called tekelu. These are large fish that thrash around violently in the shallows of the river's edge during one phase of their reproductive cycle. The avoidance is to prevent the human delivery from being similarly violent. 2. There are several species of lizards that must not be killed by either parent-to-be for fear the offspring emerge with lizard-like hands and feet. 3. Similarly the husband should avoid seeing a bear, lest the child be mongoloid. (Evidently bears are considered stupid animals.) 117</page><page sequence="4">PETER METCALF JMBRAS VOL. 55 4. A husband should not try to kill game that is in, or near, a stream. To see blood mixed with water is a bad omen, perhaps suggestive of extensive postnatal bleeding. 5. Neither husband nor wife should see anything rotten or disgusting. For the husband to stumble upon the old kill of a predator in the jungle is an omen of the most somber kind. Morris (1953:119) gives a similar list of prohibitions, with much the same symbolic content, from the Melanau folk to the south. But what concerns us here is not so much the symbolism of these nileng acts, as their mode of operation in bringing suffering on the unlucky offender. Another meaning of the term nileng , aside from tabu, is pregnant. At first sight, the two meanings of the word do not seem to relate in any way to each other. It is true, as we have seen above, that to be pregnant is to be hedged about by tabus. But what does it mean to think of rules as "pregnant"? The answer lies in a parallel conception of imminence. Berawan say that the tabus are a part of the natural order, and that this has been so since the creation. Their operation is automatic. When an individual breaches a rule, he or she is immediately put into a state of ritual danger, that is, a state of being prone to affliction. If I asked what brought the state of ritual danger about, they answered: The nileng . I tried on several occasions to pursue the question: But what spiritual agency is it that causes the affliction? Who is it that enforces the rules? I was rewarded with blank looks. Ultimately, they said, it is the Creator that is responsible, since he arranged the universe. But the state of ritual danger is a direct and unmediated result of the breach of prohibition. It is in this sense that the world is "pregnant" with things that are nileng. If a man, whose wife is near term, is careless enough to tie up his canoe, or unthinkingly disturb a fruit bat, the result is that he, she, and the unborn child, become pale . Pale is the most common form of ritual danger, and follows not only upon the breach of tabus related to pregnancy, but many other acts as well. For instance, the posts of a house must be erected in such a way that the grain of the wood runs upward in the same direction as in the living tree. To stand it the other way around is nileng and the result is pale. But there are other states of ritual danger, four to be precise (sijang, padju , tulah, parit), each the result of specific acts2. For instance, if you are offered the use of hair oil, and you refuse it without touching the bottle, you become sijang . If an old man tells a boy to come down from a tree, and the child ignores the advice, then he becomes tulah . But whatever the particular state of danger the outcome is the same in this respect: That the offender is not subject to immediate retribution, he or she is simply put in a condition of heightened vulner- ability to affliction. Following Victor Turner (1968), I use the term affliction here because it is not necessarily disease or illness that the individual will encounter, but might instead be some kind of accident. In this way, the various states might be held responsible for a wide range of untoward circumstances. Some outcomes are peculiarly associated with specific ritual conditions. If you enter the state called sijang , for example, the most likely outcome is that you will be attacked by a dangerous wild animal, particularly a crocodile, snake, or bear. 118</page><page sequence="5">PART 2, 1982 SUPERNATURAL ETIOLOGIES Whether you survive or not will depend on how nimble you are, but any such attack will immediately be interpreted as the result of sijang . However, a child that constantly makes himself tulah may suffer a variety of fates. He may one day fall out of that tall tree that he has constantly been warned not to climb. But he may equally well suffer declining health. As for pale , almost any kind of affliction might be attributed to it. However, difficulty in childbirth almost invariably will be, and thé endless list of tabus on parents-to-be ensures that the diagnosis can not be proven wrong. It is impossible to prove the negative proposition that one committed no infraction. Malinowski's functionalist argument about the operation of magic was that it reduced anxiety in the individual, and thereby facilitated calm action in situations of risk (Màlinowski 1948:78-82). The pregnancy tabus are akin to magic in that they are focussed upon an event about which considerable anxiety is felt. 3 However, it would be difficult to argue that they reduce uneasiness in either husband or wife. It would be more accurate to say that the anxiety produced by the tabus appropriately matches the anxiety of the birth itself, and this is a sentiment to which Berawan would resignedly agree. Whatever the particular affliction thought to have resulted from pale , there is only one recourse, and that is a direct appeal to the Creator Spirit, BibCNgaputong . Since he created the tabus, only he can alleviate their effect. If the offender has already drowned, or succumbed to snake bite, it is too late to do anything. But if he or she is seriously ill, but not yet at death's door, then the proper response is to construct a shrine (tapó) and offer up prayers. The illness may subsequently continue or grow worse, and all that can be done is a renewal of the appeal. No other ritual action can bring relief. Sijang is more specific in its effect, and can be lifted by shaman, who offers up little carved figures to replace the threatened human. So far we have observed the operation of purely physical causes and also of states of ritual danger in producing sickness, in the Berawan view. I turn now to the third cause, namely soul loss. Irregularities in the condition of the soul are cited only in cases of illness, and not in connection with accidents. However, there is a wide vàriety of sickness that could be attributed to it, and there is considerable overlap with other possible etiologies. To summarise: Certain kinds of relatively mild disease, together with minor accidents, arouse little speculation. They are simply the annoyances of everyday life. Serious accidents and difficulties in childbirth immediately suggest a breach of a tabu. Serious illness may have the same cause, or alternatively may be the result of soul loss. In practice, diagnoses often become complicated. If a man comes down overnight with a high fever, there is plenty of room for theorising. It may simply be something he ate, or more ominously, something that was fed to him. It could conceivably be that he is the victim of black magic. Berawan state flatly that they have no evil magic of their own. But neighboring groups, especially Malays, are believed to have it. Occasionally members of the community that have had extensive dealings with coastal folk are suspected of having learned malicious spells in their travels. Berawan shaman, it is firmly believed, can not work evil. If they attempt to do so, they simply lose their powers. Shaman may often enough be thought fake or ineffective, but they are never 119</page><page sequence="6">PETER METCALF JMBRAS VOL. 55 feared. The Berawan are very little concerned with withcraft or black magic, but nevertheless, it could be that our fever sufferer is the target of some un-Berawan trickery. He might, again, be in diminished health because of some dereliction of his own, although this is not the sort of illness that immediately brings pale to mind. Most likely, his soul has been ambushed in some spirit realm. Soul loss and shamanism But despite the fact that in illnesses of this kind several possible etiologies may be cited, it remains the case that in the Berawan view soul loss is the single most important cause of illness. It is the most frequently cited, thp most likely to cause fatal outcome, and the one for which there is the most complex battery of defenses. In fact a major segment of Berawan religion - shamanism - is concerned with little else. Harm floes not necessarily result from a temporary absence of the soul from the body. In sleep, the soul may wander into spirit worlds that lie outside the usual waking experience of human beings. There are hazards in this, but there is nothing to be done to prevent it, and it is not in itself bad. On the contrary it may be useful, because it provides information about events in those other worlds. Berawan take dreams seriously. A certain amount of folk psychiatry is accomplished through them because close kin will speak up if they have troubling dreams about one another, and I was even told that one can be held responsible for repeated hostile acts in someone else's dreams. But their usual import is as omens. On one occasion a woman dreamt repeatedly about her father, who had died only months previously. Alarmed by these portents, she consulted a shaman. On his advice, a miniature house ( meligai ) was built to accomodate the shade, and offerings of food were put inside it so that no harm would result from the visit. But not all omens received in dreams are threatening. On another occasion, a middle aged man dreamt that he made a huge catch of fish. The interpretation placed upon this was that the man would achieve personal wealth. Delighted, he hastened to "own" (puwong) the dream by making offerings and in- viting his neighbours in to drink. However, the soul should return promptly to its owner. Should it be tardy, or if it is captured by some evil spirit ( tekena , bewitched), 4 then illness results. For the victims of soul loss, curing practices center upon restoring it to the body. This is the special province of the shaman ( daiyung ) 5. The shaman is able, by the assistance of spirit helpers, to discover the whereabouts of the sufferer's soul, and what is detaining it. He or she may in addition be able to recover it, and so restore the patient to secure health. ТЪе curing rites and seances in which this is attempted are a frequent occurrence, perhaps the most common of all religious observances. Often there would be seances for different people on several nights in a row, or even on the same night. On rare occasions, such as when a family suspects that it is subject to supernatural attack by someone within the community, performances are held in private at the dead of night. But almost invariably they are open to anyone who wishes to wander in, and held during the day or in the evening. This is consistent with the Berawan view, noted above, that shamans can not use their powers maliciously. 120</page><page sequence="7">PART 2, 1982 SUPERNATURAL ETIOLOGIES Consequently, it was possible after the first few months of fieldwork to observe many shamanistic sessions. The first hint that one was planned was often the sight of small boys ransacking the roosts of hens. Eggs are necessary for the offerings prepared for the spirit helpers of the shaman. But Berawan allow their chickens to roam freely in the gardens around the longhouse, and finding enough eggs to keep up with the demand was often difficult. Skepticism about particular shamans is often expressed, but confidence in the institution remains high. Even in the longhouses that are now Christian, they still operate. In the two communities studied intensively there were approximately fifty people per shaman, a rate that compares favourably with general practitioners in our own society. Many features of Berawan shamanism are similar to the classic examples from Siberia and Central Asia, described at length by Mircea Eliade (1964). But there are also points of difference, and moreover there is considerable variation in style of operation between practitioners. This is not the place to give a full description of Berawan shamanism. Instead I give a brief account of two well known daiyung whose styles differ. The first is a woman in her late fifties, named Sad*Miri. She has a dignified bearing, but this does not mask a kindly disposition. Sad* Miri knew that she must become a daiyung because of chronic illness that overtook her in her thirties, and that would respond to no kind of treatment. An established female adept pronounced the illness caused by a spirit that wished to enter her, and so SadsTMiri began instruction under the older woman. She still suffers from poor health, including painful cramps, which she describes as sakek daiyung {sakek = sick, sickness). She finds her performances physically exhausting, but they usually give her relief from her own symptoms, in addition to the curing that she attempts to do for others, so that she sometimes conducts a session simply for her own benefit, or, as she says, because the spirits wish to entertain themselves. Her seances begin in a standardised fashion. She is assisted by her husband, Sad* Pejong. Wearing her best red-hued sarong, and with her hair formally coiled in a bun at the back of her head, she takes up her position seated on a large gong in front of an antique brass stand that supports a small bowl of water. In the water are two six inch sticks from a mystically powerful shrub, stripped of their bark to reveal the creamy white sap wood. With each in turn she sprinkles water upon herself, and her patient, if there is one, using a deft flick of the wrist. Meanwhile, her husband is gently strupiming a sape , an instrument resembling a banjo but carved out of one piece of wood. Sad? Miri puts her head in her hands and begins to hum throatily, a shudder passes through her body, and she is in trance. What happens next depends upon the will of the spirit that arrives first, which will be one of the trio that first inspired her and made her a shaman. They are minor nature spirits, which have male personalities. When one of them arrives, it may wish to dance or to sing, and it will do so using Sadx* Miri's body. The transformation in her is striking. On the several occasions that I saw it, it never failed to electrify her audience. Her voice becomes unrecognisable, and her body posture changes. Sometimes she sings first, or she dances, using a sprightly masculine step. She also quaffs down the rice wine and smokes the cigarettes that 121</page><page sequence="8">PETER METCALF JMBRAS VOL. 55 have been placed handy, and it is said that the spirits enjoy this opportunity to make merry among human beings. After some minutes of this she will sit down on the gong again and begin offering advice on the matter at hand or anything else about longhouse affairs in a low rhythmic chant. Frequently, other spirits arrive, helpers added to her repretoire after the initial trio, and her voice and body undergo further changes. The new personae identify themselves by their mannerisms, and the audience pays close attention to see which spirit is arriving. Sometimes spirits change places so rapidly that everyone is hard put to guess what is happening, and then some familiar spirit arrives and the crowd greets it with a shout. Sad*Miri usually performs in the late evening on the verandah, which is the public area of the residential structure typical of central northern Borneo, the longhouse. She dances, struts, and sings in a small circle of lamplight, which also illuminates the faces of her audience. If the matter is routine, the crowd is small, just those directly involved and a few curious onlookers. But others are listening from their sleeping places in nearby rooms. One of her helpers is a child, an orphan boy that died of neglect many years ago, whose spiritJiovers below the longhouse. It likes to sing nursery rhymes, and to rush about the verandah pulling people's hair and playing pranks. It is a great favourite, and people will call out from their beds to the suddenly child-like Sadaf Miri, greeting the child. During all this, it is her husband's job to play the sape when required, to prevent Sad*Miri from hurting herself in any way, and most significantly, to interpret the instructions and advice that the spirits offer in a bewildering variety of languages and voices. Sad* Pejong speaks several isolects that are related to Berawan. But even he is lost occasionally, and it is concluded that they have contact with a spirit of such a distant age or place that it is beyond the knowledge of anyone present. The instructions that are offered consist of prescriptions or special tabus for the sick, as well as advice on community matters. Sometimes Sad&amp;liri will mime out the recovery of a lost soul, catching it in the blade of a parang (work knife and weapon) and restoring it to the owner through the crown of the crown of the head. Finally, after something between an hour and two hours, Sad*Miri sits down on the gong in her original posture, and shudders violently several times. The trance is ended. After a few moments she wipes her face and looks up. She appears dazed and tired. She turns to her husband to ask what happened. It is not clear who or what is considered responsible for the recovery of souls. Sad*"Miri reports that the experience is, for her, very much like waking out of a dream; it is hazy and soon escapes from the memory. But her soul, along with those of her spirit helpers that are not at that moment in her body, makes astral journeys to locate the soul of the sick person and to wrest it away from whatever has seized it. That is why the experience is so draining for her. In this way, Sad*'liri's style of shamanism is in accordance with the classical pattern - she is a psychopomp. In contrast, the second style of daiyung that I describe does not fit this pattern. Eliade's minimal definition of shamanism is that it is a technique of ecstasy (1964:4), by which I take it he means trance. By that criterion Tama Ukat Sageng, most famous of Berawan daiyung , was not a shaman. As he described it, he remained conscious in 122</page><page sequence="9">PART 2, 1982 Plate 1.

It was just that the room was for him inhabited by other beings, spirits, who sat between us and in front of us, and to whom he also talked in the language of spirits, which was incomprehensible to us. He principally relied upon one spirit helper, but that was the most powerful of nature spirits, called simply bib&amp;ij*(bilx= spirit, kij* = big, great). The props that he uses are usually simple, a tray (pakan) with various offerings to the spirits, including candy, rice cakes, rice wine, and the hard-to-find eggs, now hard boiled. After the spirits have left, those sitting there may sample the candy and eggs. The remainder is hung under the eaves, at the back of the family apartment. On all the occasions that I saw him perform, Tama Ukat Sageng's style was unsensational, almost inconspicuous. He merely sat beside his patient, nodding and muttering to his invisible friends. He suffered no shaman's illness, in fact he was very seldom sick. He learned his skills from no other daiyung , but acquired them independently in his youth. These two examples show the range of variation in personal style of operation. But beyond that, there are a host of special ciiring rituals that are elaborations on the basic format of each practitioner. Sometimes daiyung work together in teams. Sometimes their spirits decide that special apparatus must be constructed: Spirit houses of various kinds (meligai and beran), swings (ayun), little boats (along), posts hung with leaves like those used in the headhunting cult ( belawing ), and barriers of vines (i rem g ). Each has its own uses. Ayun are useful to enable a novice shaman to get her or his spirit "seated straight". Little rafts or boats are used to drift infection away from the house. Rerng allow a mystical barrier that no one may cross to be placed around a room, or even a whole longhouse. In the past they were employed to good effect to quarantine a community in time of deadly epidemics, such as the cholera that periodically swept through the area. In all of these different contexts, the daiyung are seen working to preserve or restore a correct relationship between souls and their owners. They constitute the focus of Berawan reactions to illness and disease, and as such they provide an answer to the universal problem of the origin of evil. The misfortunes of men largely come to them because of the malice of anonymous spirits that steal their souls. The shamans, members of the community, stuggle to recoverthem. In this scheme of things there is little room for witchcraft, which locates the source of evil within human society. It is because of the centrality of the doctrinp of souls that the Berawan have so little concern with magic. Symptoms and etiologies Although the styles and techniques of shaman are varied, their strategy for restoring health to their patients is entirely uniform. It comprises the recovery of lost souls. But how can so many types of sickness result from a single root cause? Why should soul loss produce different symptoms in different victims? This question was not one that Berawan had ever specifically phrased for themselves, and they had difficulty in answering it. Sometimes it was suggested that the type of illness depends upon the circumstances affecting the soul. For instance, 123</page><page sequence="12">PETER METCALF JMBRAS VOL. 55 people with chronic diseases are often described as having habitually truant souls, ones that return frequently enough to maintain life but do not stay long enough to produce a cure. Again, in the curing rites it is sometimes hinted that the nature of the illness will be understood when the malevolent spirit that had ensnared the lost soul is identified. But no one was comfortable with the idea that the hostile spirit dictated the symptoms manifested by the patient. A second possible answer is that soul loss produces, not specific illnesses, but a condition of heightened vulnerability to sickness. In this view, the action of soul loss is homologous with that of states ritual danger. There is no specifiable period of absence that makes illness inevitable. What sickness actually occurs is contingent; as with the irritating but not normally lethal medical problems that prompt no super- natural explanation, such as skin diseases, the physical mechanisms by which the individual develops a given symptbmology are taken for granted, or, at least, not the subject of any indigenous theory. Consequently, when government extension agents come to the longhouse to explain how it is that flies may spread infections, or the dangers of drinking water directly from the river, there is no traditionalist party in the community that resists this education. It took very little encouragement from medical personnel to induce the Berawan to cover unattended food, and diligently to boil all water intended for drinking. Nor is this simply a matter of hedging bets. Even when an afflicted individual recovers, with or without traditional herbal or western medicine, it may still be judged appropriate to take action to remove what is seen as an underlying super- natural disturbance. As Berawan achieve a fuller understanding of the mechanism of microorganisms and disease carrying vectors, it remains possible simultaneously to adhere to conceptions of soul loss and ritual danger. Footnotes ¿The Berawan number some 1,600 people divided between four longhouse communities, two in the Tutoh river and two in the Tinjar, both rivers being tributaries of the Baram in Sarawak's Seventh Division. Fieldwork was conducted between January 1972 and February 1974, supported by the Foreign Area Fellowship Program, National Science Foundation, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and under the sponsorship of the Sarawak Museum. 2These various states of ritual danger comprise a system that is internally structured. But space does not permit a full elaboration of that structure here. 3These tabus do not fulfill the usual definition of magic because they are social in content. It is in the interest of everyone that there be many children to make the community strong and vigorous. 4The editor, Dato' Sheppard, points out to me that the Malay term terkena has a similar meaning. Berawan, of course, shares many words cognate with Malay. But the use of tekena may well indicate a borrowing in historical times. The Berawan have been in regular contact with the Sultanate of Brunei for several centuries, and have acquired many items Of material and mental culture from there. 3The term used for shamans by the Kayan and Kenyah, who are neighbours of the Berawan, is similar: dayong, or day un g . The techniques employed are also similar, but in this brief sketch, space does not allow any comparisons to be made. 124</page><page sequence="13">PART 2, 1982 SUPERNATURAL ETIOLOGIES References cited Eliade, M. 1964 Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.
