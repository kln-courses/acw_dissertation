Mr. and Mrs. Frank G. Logan Purchase Prize Fund, 1966.336 In the 1960s, when the Abstract Expressionist and Pop Art movements were trans- forming artists' working methods, George Segal explored the long-established genre of figurative sculpture. He created life-size human figures using cloth strips dipped in wet plaster and displayed the rough, unpainted casts as his finished product. Segal often placed his sculptural forms within a larger tableau of commercially made objects in order to create active, eerily inhabited spaces. Purchased in 1966, The Truck was the Art Institute's first acquisition to incorporate a moving-image element. The artist combined the front of a red Ford F-Series pickup; one of his signature cast-plaster figures as the driver; and the film Highway at Night (projected on the truck's windshield, in a continuous loop) to create what is now commonly referred to as an environmental sculpture. While today's audiences for contemporary art are used to having disparate visual elements presented to them in this way, Segal's early work was truly groundbreaking. The same year The Truck was acquired, it won first prize in the museum's Sixty- Eighth American Exhibition. This display, curator A. James Speyer explained in the catalogue, "shows the work of twenty artists, each with a kind of complete, individual exhibit rather than a single, specific painting or sculpture. . . . All these exhibits share a physical insistence and vital presence which assumes environmental stature."1 An article on the show in Time captures both the novelty of The Truck in 1966 and something of what it is like to experience it even now: The runaway hit of the show was easily Segal's creation, The Truck. It consisted of the actual cab of a red panel truck that Segal had found in a junkyard. Inside, the odometer read 85,723, the generator and oil-pressure gauges glowed red in the dashboard. In the driver's seat was an alert, life-size white plaster driver, both hands on the wheel, right foot hovering over the accelerator. As viewers looked over his shoulders at the windshield, they shared a cinematic ride through city streets, as lights, cars, and bright neon signs whizzed by. To bring off the joy ride, Segal had rigged a small film projector and mirror arrangement to the right of the cab, which beamed the movie onto the truck's frosted windshield. Watching it, one housewife confided: "That's the way my husband drives..." Juror Martin Friedman, director of Minneapolis' Walker Art Center, put it another way: "I found it very moving. Actually ... by treating the man almost as a ghost, as a calcified figure, Segal presents you with reality, then questions the existence of reality.2 One of Segal's most important early works, The Truck helped to change sculpture by encompassing its viewers - allowing them to share an experience over a period of time - and by blurring the once-steadfast boundaries between life and art.

Gift of Society for Contemporary Art, Obj. 184159 In spring 1973, the Society for Contemporary Art, in conjunction with the newly formed Film Center at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, hosted Contemporary Film Art, a landmark exhibition featuring twenty films by seventeen artists. The mission of the society, an independent group affiliated with the Art Institute, is to promote a better understanding and appreciation of the art of our time. In this instance, it achieved this end by boldly affirming, "Film is art."1 Contemporary Film Art showcased works by noted filmmakers alongside those of painters and sculptors who looked to film as an extension of their experimental ideas and innovations. In their review in the Chicago Tribune, Jane Allan and Derek Guthrie claimed, "It wasn't that they were all great films. In fact, they ranged in quality from very good to downright awful. But as a group, they were lively and they were about something or perhaps, reaching for something beyond the ability to fill up a few yards of space or canvas or screen with nicely finished saleable art."2 The foresight shown by the society and by Camille Cook, then director of the Film Center, has proved remarkable within the contexts of both the Art Institute's holdings of contemporary art and the larger history of experimental film.3 The Society for Contemporary Art films include the earliest explorations in the medium by artists such as Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, Ed Ruscha, and Richard Serra, resonating with their other works in the permanent collection and providing a rich sense of each artist's particular oeuvre. Placed alongside the efforts of noted filmmakers like Jordan Belson, Stan Brakhage, Bruce Conner, and Michael Snow, they reflect the artistic climate of the mid-1950s to early 1970s; this was one defined by fluidity, one in which artists frequently moved between different media, creating a web of dialogue and influence.4 The earliest film in the collection is Brakhage's Wonder Ring (opposite, at top). Con- sidered one of the most important avant-garde filmmakers, Brakhage, according to filmmaker and curator Brian Frye, "single-handedly -transformed the schism separating the avant-garde from classical filmmaking into a chasm."5 Tellingly, a number of artists in this selection of films looked to Brakhage's earliest works as a source of creative inspiration and insight. Shortly after moving to New York, Brakhage met the artist Joseph Cornell, who commissioned him to film the soon-to-be-dismantled Third Avenue El. Shooting for the first time without actors or a plot, Brakhage instead turned to the expressive qualities of the medium itself. The result was a film with no story, no protagonist, no linear narrative other than the train's endless voyage around the track.6 Bruce Conner's first film, A Movie (opposite, at bottom), is a tour-de-force of editing, a deluge of images composed entirely of found footage from B-movies, newsreels, novelty shorts, and other sources. Each clip lasts only a few seconds, as the viewer desperately tries to hold at least one image in his or her memory, even though they are impossible to fully absorb. No matter how many times one sees A Movie, different scenes leap out, making it appear to be a different film. As Conner recalled, "Every time one of my films is shown, it's a unique event, and it alters my consciousness as well as the rest of the audience's."7 As a young artist in New York, Richard Serra was introduced to experimental film through works by luminaries in the field, including Brakhage, Conner, Snow, and Yvonne 12</page><page sequence="4">Bruce Conner American, 1933-2008 A Movie 1958 16mm black-and-white film, sound; 12 min.

Serra translated this concept to film in Hand Catching Lead (opposite, at top) and Hands Scraping. The former shows a close-up of the artist's hand as he attempts to grasp, and frequently misses, lumps of lead as they drop from above. Hands Scraping, made in collaboration with composer Philip Glass, depicts Serra trying to remove lead from his studio floor. Both films are playful examinations of an artist's relationship to his materials, yet each suggests a sense of futility about the creative process. A few years earlier, Serra had struck up a friendship with Michael Snow, who was shooting Wavelength (opposite, at bottom). This incredibly influential work, which documents the continuous zoom of a fixed camera within an eighty-foot urban loft, is a key example of a "structural film," a term coined in 1979 by avant-garde film historian P. Adams Sitney to describe works characterized by a pared down, often predetermined practice. In Wavelength, the camera is pointed toward an opposing wall that is lined with windows looking out onto the street below. Its zoom takes forty-five minutes to traverse the space from its widest field to its smallest, ending on a lone photograph of waves. The fixed perspective is enhanced by the introduction of colored filters, changes in film stock, and alternating positive and negative processing; it is disrupted, however, by four human events, including a man's apparent death. The soundtrack consists of a sine wave from the lowest to the highest register, overlaid with street sounds, a ringing telephone, speech, and music. Like Snow's films, Bruce Nauman's works of the late 1960s take as their concept the process of creating art. Yet in his early films, Nauman used his own body as a material.9 For example, in Dance or Exercise on the Perimeter of a Square (Square Dance) (above), he outlines a square on his studio floor with masking tape, marking each side at its halfway point. Beginning at one corner, he methodically moves around the perimeter of the square to the sound of a metronome, sometimes facing into its interior, sometimes out. Each pace is the equivalent of half the length of a side of the taped square. Dance or Exercise is among several significant film and video works by Nauman in the Art Institute's collection, which also contains works in other media including the bronze sculpture Second Poem Piece (1969), the installation Diamond Africa with Chair Tuned, D.E.A.D. (198 r), and the monumental neon Human Nature/ Life Death (1983). 15</page><page sequence="7">Robert Morris American, born 1931 Neo Classic 1971 i6mm black-and-white film, silent; 1530 min.

Gift of Society for Contemporary Art, Obj. 184162 16 While at first Robert Morris's Neo Classic and Ed Ruscha's Premium seem far removed from each artist's usual practice, they both represent a playful, tongue-in-cheek use of film. Most known for his Minimalist sculptures, Morris created Neo Classic (above) a mere forty-eight hours before the opening of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, London. The piece shows a naked model wandering through the gallery space while interacting with Morris's artwork. According to the Tate, "The calm, meditative behavior of the model suggests that Morris had no idea that the public would respond to his sculptures so exuberantly."10 Ruscha's film features his friends Larry Bell, Leon Bing, Rudi Gernreich, and Tommy Smothers, and is based on "How to Derive the Maximum Pleasure from Crackers" (1964), a comic short story by his lifelong friend Mason Williams that he made into the artist's book Crackers (1969). Premium (opposite) exists as a quirky document of the changing sexual and class sensibilities of southern California in the 1970s. It illustrates precisely Williams 's text, which offers a set of absurd instructions that encourage the protagonist to find a beautiful, "hard to get" woman; rent two hotel rooms on the same day, one in a "skid row flop house" and the other in the "finest hotel in town"; purchase a host of fresh vegetables; and build a salad in the bed of the cheap motel. The woman is then brought to the room, where she is coaxed into bed with the salad and covered with dressing, at which point the protagonist runs out of the motel, drives to the nearest store to purchase a box of cheap saltine crackers, and retires to the bed in the expensive hotel</page><page sequence="8">to nibble the crackers and derive "maximum enjoyment from them."11 At least one artist, the noted conceptual provocateur Jonathan Monk, has looked to this work as a point of departure, as evidenced in Chinese Crackers (2006), his own reinterpretation of Premium that stars Liu Wei and other Chinese artists. In 1973 - an early date for a museum to be acquiring film - the Society for Contemporary Art, along with Cook and curators A. James Speyer and Anne Rorimer, recognized the medium's relevance in an encyclopedic setting such as the Art Institute's. Filmmakers traditionally house their works in film archives, yet museums can provide a broader context in which they might be understood - not only alongside other films, but also, importantly, in relation to works in other media. To this end, the Department of Contemporary Art is in the process of reconstituting and accessioning the collection of all eighteen films, either by preserving existing prints, purchasing new ones, and, whenever possible, creating new internegatives along with archival and exhi- bition copies. The goal is to safeguard the objects associated with this remarkable moment in the museum's history and celebrate the visionary efforts of those who paved the way for our continued commitment to collecting cutting-edge art in all media.

Mead and Twentieth-Century Purchase funds; through prior gift of Joseph Winterbotham; gift of Lannan Foundation, 1997.162 18 Bruce Nauman is a wildly influential artist whose work has explored the poetics of confusion, anxiety, boredom, entrapment, and failure since the 1960s. In many of his important early efforts, the artist used his own body as the vehicle for exploration. In Art Make-Up, Nos. 1-4 (opposite), he applies colored makeup - white, pink, green, and finally black - in successive layers to his face and torso, introducing the themes of surveillance and masking that recur in his later creations. Like his entire oeuvre, Art Make-Up can be read as a self-conscious investigation into the conditions and possibilities of art making itself. Nauman was a key figure in the experimental film and video movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s with such works as Dance or Exercise Around the Perimeter of a Square (Square Dance) (p. 15). After 1973, film and video become conspicuously absent from his work, replaced largely by language-based neon sculptures. He returned to video more than a decade later, with Good Boy Bad Boy (p. 20). Of this decision, the artist recalled, "I think it's because I had this information that I didn't want to put into a neon sign. ... I had thought about presenting it as a performance, but I have never felt comfortable with performance. And so video seemed to be a way to do it."1 Conceived as a didactic moral statement, the installation employs two actors, Joan Lancaster and Tucker Smallwood, who are presented in close-up, like newscasters, on two separate monitors. Each recites a one-hundred-line commentary on the human condition that includes passages such as "I was a good boy/You were a good boy/We were good boys" and "I hate/ You hate/We hate/This is hating." Directly confronting the viewer, they deliver each repetition with increased emotional intensity, shifting in and out of sync with one another. Installed in an enclosed, darkened space, Clown Torture (p. 21) consists of two rectangular pedestals, each supporting two pairs of stacked color monitors (one turned upside down, one turned on its side); two large, color- video projections on facing walls; and sound from all six video displays.2 The monitors play four narrative sequences in perpetual loops, each chronicling an absurd misadventure of a clown, who is played to brilliant effect by the actor Walter Stevens. According to the artist, distinctions may be made among the clown protagonists; one is the "Emmett Kelly dumb clown; one is the old French Baroque clown; one is a sort of traditional polka- dot, red-haired, oversized show clown; and one is a jester."3 In "No, No, No, No (Walter)," the clown incessantly screams "No!" while jumping, kicking, or lying down; in "Clown with Goldfish," he struggles to balance a fish bowl on the ceiling with the handle of a broom; in "Clown with Water Bucket," he repeatedly opens a door that is booby-trapped with a bucket of water, which falls on his head; and finally, in "Pete and Repeat," he succumbs to the terror of a seemingly inescapable nursery rhyme: "Pete and Repeat are sitting on a fence. Pete falls off. Who's left? Repeat." Of his work, Nauman has said, "From the beginning I was trying to see if I could make art that . . . was just there all at once. Like getting hit in the face with a baseball bat. Or better, like getting hit in the back of the head. You never see it coming; it</page><page sequence="10">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="11">just knocks you down. . . . The kind of intensity that doesn't give you any trace of whether you're going to like it or not."4 Clown Torture functions in very much this way: as an assault on viewers' aural and visual perception. One of Nauman's most spectacular achievements in video installation, it marked a major new direction and prefigured his recent, more complex environments involving monitors, projections, and other sculptural elements.

Wegman American born 1943 was among tne first generation of video artists, and over the course of his career he has made over 150 works in the medium. The selection presented here was shown alongside Bruce Nauman's Art Make-Up, Nos. 1-4 (p. 19) in the Art Institute's 1974 exhibition Idea and Image in Recent Art.1 Selected ^Vofks ^n t'ie ear^y 197OS^ Wegman began filming his own experimental performances, creating pieces that were a combination of documentation, parody, and subtle criticism of art making and artists, including himself. Within these, he demonstrated Black-and-white videos, sound; his fascination with linguistics and semiotics through the use of palindromes, puns, Reel Two: io min., Reel Three: 16 min. and fragmentary dialogue. Wegman was not alone in this interest - in the early 1970s, Twentieth-Century Purchase Fund, 1974.2243-0 prominent artists such as John Baldessari (see pp. 66-6y' Bruce Nauman (see pp. 18-21), and Ed Ruscha (see pp. 16-17), among others, shared his focus on language.2 Selected Works is composed of short videos whose durations range from sixteen seconds to just over four minutes. Reels two and three include playful demonstrations and sales pitches for fictional consumer goods that take the form of television adver- tisements and infomercials.3 In Massage Chair (above, at left), for example, Wegman talks for more than a minute as he attempts to pass off an uncomfortable plastic chair as a revolutionary invention. Other works in the compilation involve the artist's Weimeraner, Man Ray, his faithful companion and collaborator for over twelve years. While the works featuring Wegman alone are often humorous, Man Ray's presence is instantly endearing. In The Kiss (at right), Wegman lays on the floor with a bone in his mouth while Man Ray attempts to wrestle it away. Wegman 's videos, much like his other works, are economical yet poignant. At first glance, they are undoubtedly engaging as portraits of the relationship between humans and animals. Less expected, however, are the ways in which his early- 1970s critique of television culture still resonates today. 22 K.M.B.</page><page sequence="14">Bob Snyder American, born 1946 Lines of Force 1979 Color video, sound; io min Trim Subdivisions 1981 Color video, silent; 6 min. Gift of Society for Contemporary Art, 1983.265-66 In over three decades of work, Bob Snyder has combined synthesized sound and visual imagery to great effect. He played an integral role in developing the Sound Art Department at the School of the Art Institute, where he has been a faculty member since 1974. While formally trained in music and composition, Snyder originally had ambitions as a painter and always maintained a strong interest in visual representation. His early experiments with oscilloscopes - which he used to visualize sound waves and accompany his musical compositions - naturally led him to video technology, which afforded further opportunities to blend the visual and the aural in innovative ways. Among the original collaborators with Dan Sandin at University of Illinois-Chicago's Circle Graphics Habitat, Snyder was in the vanguard of formal video investigations with the Sandin Image Processor and other experimental equipment.1 Modulating between abstract and representational images, Lines of Force (above, at left) uses found footage from a variety of sources, including a classified weapons testing film produced by the United States Army, segments from the 1973 movie Psychomania, and various selections from broadcast television. The artist described using the editing technique of the match cut - juxtaposing things that happen to resemble each other within the same frame - as a way of creating visual puns. Trim Subdivisions (at right) constitutes a departure from much of Snyder's work in that it has no soundtrack.2 The artist created this purely visual composition with the most sophisticated digital effects and editing techniques of the day, which enabled him to manipulate images of tract-house facades that he shot in suburban Indiana. The silence is palpable, adding to the eerie quality of the oppressively uniform architecture.

In constructing these works, the artist draws from his extensive study of Eastern and Western art, philosophy, and religion. He also consistently deploys cutting-edge technologies, investigating new ways to manipulate viewers' percep- tion.1 Both the videos in The Reflecting Pool and the installation Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House are important early works that foreshadow Viola's later creations, combining philosophic inquiry with captivating physical environments. The Reflecting Pool is a series comprising five individual videos, including Moonblood (at middle), that offer a collective meditation on the various stages in an individual life. The first work, also titled The Reflecting Pool (at top), demonstrates the shift from stillness to motion as a fixed camera captures a, man approaching a pool of water through trees and lush foliage. The only sounds are those of the branches rustling and the water rippling. The man momentarily stands before the pool before jumping into the air. As he reaches the crest of his jump, he is frozen in space while the water beneath him continues to undulate. There is a fleeting reflection of other people walking around the pool, although no one can be seen doing so. After a series of similar perceptual and temporal fragmentations, the man's image fades, leaving only the pool. The final moments of the video are evocative of baptism, as a nude man emerges from the water and retreats into the woods. In this series, Viola aims to deconstruct viewers' concepts of time and memory, divorcing images from their subjective meaning and reconnecting them to universal truths. This process of fostering self-awareness is an undercurrent of the artist's practice. He has remarked, "There's another dimension that you just know is there, that can be a source of real knowledge, and the -quest for connecting with that and identifying that is the whole impetus for me to cultivate these experiences and to make my work."2 The haunting Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House (at bottom) contains a solitary wood chair with headphones attached, facing a television monitor. Viola, looking visibly fatigued, appears on the screen, sitting in his own chair. Here, the artist compels viewers into an intimate relationship: they sit at eye level with him, listening to the sound of his breathing through the headphones. The silence and tension in the installation is disrupted at irregular intervals by a dissonant, jarring sound that echoes throughout the gallery. At the same time, Viola is hit over the head with a magazine. Taken as a whole, the work suggests a scene of execution or torture, with its single chair and its haggard artist, sleep-deprived and assaulted while seated alone in an empty room. In both The Reflecting Pool and Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House, the artist urges viewers to become active participants. Of his work, Viola stated, "You're a part of it. It's not something that's just a fixed projection from the past."3 K.M.B. 24</page><page sequence="16">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="17">Nam June Paik American, born Korea, 1932-2006 FCLtnilv of Robot' Bctbv ^ pi°neermS figure in electronic art, Nam June Paik was among the first to use television as an art form. Originally a composer of experimental and electronic music, he created performance work within the context of the Fluxus movement in the Color video, silent, thirteen monitors and 1950s. The artist viewed his musical instruments as "objects with visual qualities," aluminum armature; 133.3 x 96.2 x 20.3 cm which allowed him to move fluidly from using sound to incorporating images into (52 1/2 x 37 7/8 x 8 in.) his creations.1 Having begun exhibiting works with televisions in 1963, Paik was one Gift of Society for Contemporary Art, 1992.283 of the earliest artists to use a Sony Portapak (the first portable video recording device) after it became available in 1965, producing his initial multimonitor video sculptures the following year.2 Family of Robot, the first series of video sculptures that Paik created, consists of three generations of family members, including a grandmother and grandfather; mother and father; aunt and uncle; and children. Paik pursued the theme of generational difference through his choice of materials, providing a unified history of family and technology. Viewed as a whole, this group of anthropomorphic sculptures incorporates media hardware from various stages of its evolution in the twentieth century. The grandparents' heads are constructed of 1930s radios and their bodies of 1940s television frames refitted with Sony or Quasar screens, while the parents' heads are more recent than their bodies. The children, including Baby, are made of newer televisions. In some cases, the children's heads are two decades more advanced than their bodies, and in others, both sections are made of uniform parts. The Art Institute's Baby - one of nine unique baby robots - was assembled from thirteen Samsung monitors, which at the time were the most up-to-date equipment manufactured in Korea. The monitors are placed in different directions in the aluminum armature, depending on the section of the body they represent. In Family of Robot, television is used not as a*means of disseminating information but rather as a more decorative element. Like its relatives, Baby displays an artist- created videotape - in this case, one that consists of flashing, vibrant images of hearts, psychedelic patterns, revolving bands and planets, and excerpts of newscasts depicting people, especially children, in Africa and India. Paik insisted that a balance should exist between nature and technology, a notion that he realized in this friendly looking figure, which is a remarkable product of his own time and effort.3 With this series, Paik suggested that technology is both a product of human innovation and a potential cause of our retreat from reality. In a sense, he explicitly humanized technology as a means of resistance, commenting, "One must . . . know technology very well in order to be able to overcome it."4 Stating that the purpose of video art is "to liberate people from the tyranny of TV," he was perhaps reminding us of the capability of technology - or, more specifically, of broadcast television - to consume our lives, and asserting the need for us to see it in a different form, such as art.5 Although Baby's televisions are now dated themselves, this obsolescence only enhances the work's ability to evoke the rapid transformation of technology.

In the 1970s, Hill experimented first with sound installations and then a video recorder. In the 1980s, alongside other video artists such as Bruce Nauman (see pp. 1 8-21) and Bill Viola (see pp. 24-25), he began to focus on the technical capabilities of the medium rather than its aesthetic qualities, seeking to create a meditative space where he could explore issues of authorship, consciousness, and semiotics. Like other works by Hill, Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place is an amalgam of visual, structural, and sound components. The piece consists of sixteen staggered, uncased monitors that display life-size male body parts, pages of a book being thumbed, and a page with text that is too small to read. Varying in size from one-quarter inch (an eyepiece of a video camera) to twenty-three inches (the size of a ribcage), the screens, with their exposed, nervelike wires, are recessed into a five- foot niche that is set below eye level. The fragmented figure's subtle movements are juxtaposed with nearly inaudible speech, primitive sounds of groaning, smacking noises, finger tapping, rippling water, and gun shots. Moving in close enough to decipher the sound, the viewer hears intermittent statements including "It was only an idea" and "I couldn't say it any other way," as if the body has its own language. Rooted in Poststructuralist theory, including the work of French philosopher Maurice Blanchot and others, Hill's practice merges the visual and literary arts. As he has said, "My preoccupation with language began with very sculptural notions coming out of sound, the body, utterance and speaking."1 In Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place, Hill adds a layer of language and deconstructs his own body, focusing on the scene as a whole rather than on each individual image. The dismembered body is decidedly self-referential, appearing as a random pile, or, as Hill put it, "a kind of debris."2 Abstracted, it exudes ä'sensation of presence and absence, having become barely recognizable despite its close-up detail. On one level, Hill seems to be challenging a notion of masculine authority by revealing and fracturing an image of male nudity. Unmoored from their usual spatial and temporal relationship to one another, these body parts are treated almost as a still life or landscape painting. Indeed, the work can be seen as a vanitas image; the visceral sounds and the barely moving, harshly lit figure are the only signs of life and thus serve as reminders of its transience - and perhaps also of the impermanent nature of electronic media.3 This disturbing and complex video installation suggests many dichotomies: being and knowing, self and other, private and public, reality and imagination.4 EJ. 28</page><page sequence="20">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="21">William Kentridge South African, born 1955 Johannesburg- 2nd Greatest City after Paris 1989 16mm color film, sound, transferred to digital video (projection); 8:02 min.

Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 2007.38 William Kentridge's interdisciplinary practice includes animated films, drawings, and installations, as well as theatrical and operatic direction. Through these diverse media, the artist, who was born and raised in Johannesburg, explores the impact of social history and political upheaval on the human condition. Although South Africa serves as his primary source, his analysis and the works it informs contain allegorical narratives that incorporate universal themes of good and evil, power and freedom. Kentridge explained, "I have never tried to make illustrations of apartheid, but the drawings and the films are certainly spawned by, and feed off, the brutalized society left in its wake. I am interested in a political art, that is to say an art of ambiguity, contradiction, uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings. An art (and a politics) in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay."1 Kentridge creates his animated films through a time-consuming process of over- laying, redrawing, and erasing marks on a small number of large charcoal and pastel drawings. He alters the image for each shot, leaving obvious traces of past states in nearly every frame; this layered effect inadvertently becomes a metaphor for the impact of historical memory on the present. As Kentridge has stated, "The very term cnew South Africa' has within it the idea of a painting over of the old, the natural process of disremembering, the naturalization of things new."2 Drawings for Projection is the name that Kentridge uses to refer to his series of films that includes Johannesburg - 2nd Greatest City after Paris (opposite, at top), Monument (at bottom), Mine (p. 32), and Sobriety, Obesity &amp; Growing Old (p. 33, at top).3 Created while apartheid was being dismantled, these films examine the lives of two South African men and their relationships (both complicit and oppositional) to the structures of oppression. Kentridge himself is Anglo-Jewish, and his two protagonists, Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitlebaum, represent two opposing stereotypical notions of Jewish identity, existing as alter egos. Felix, cast as a sensitive dreamer, wanders through the tumultuous landscape of postcolonial South Africa naked, lost, and often alone. An exaggerated portrait of the Jewish intellectual, he* seems to bear the social and moral conscience of an entire troubled nation. Soho, a cigar-smoking industrialist dressed in a pinstriped suit, represents the quintessential corporate fat cat associated with the greedy, corrupt, and oppressive elements of South African society. As the four films unfold, however, both Felix and Soho evolve and grow, demonstrating a much greater degree of complexity than might be expected. Ubu Tells the Truth (p. 33, at bottom) is based on Alfred Jarry's 1896 play Ubu Roi, a satire about an archetypal character who abuses his power and embodies humanity's most negative aspects. Inspired by testimony given during the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was set up by the South African government in 1995 to investigate human rights abuses under apartheid, Kentridge originally conceived this work as a series of eight etchings and also transformed it into a theatrical performance.4 In the animated film, the artist interlaced documentary footage and photographs depicting narratives of daily life, combining terrible acts of murder and torture with cartoonish depictions of the fictional dictator Ubu to 30</page><page sequence="22">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="23">relate actual experiences of public trauma. Kentridge situated Jarry's character within a familiar contemporary setting, stressing the more burlesque aspects of the original and presenting him as the dangerous yet laughable embodiment of power and evil. Kentridge's musical accompaniment to his films is an important element of their character development and emotional impact. Whereas the artist had some compos- itions specifically arranged for the films in Drawings for Projections , he chose others from sources as diverse as Antonin Dvorak, Duke Ellington, and South African choirs. The powerful reunion of Soho and his wife at the end of Sobriety, Obesity &amp; Growing Old, for example, is enriched by the aria "M'appari tutt'amor" from Friedrich von Flotow's opera Martha (1847). At times sound is shown emanating from loudspeakers, as when Felix sits on and near them, listening, as one critic put it, "to the world."5 Evocative of the figuration and political scenes of William Hogarth, Francisco Goya, and Max*B eckmann, Kentridge's art addresses contemporary issues of capitalism and power, guilt, and responsibility. His unscripted films are process driven, engaging in and reflecting upon the political history of South Africa while creating nuanced, ambiguous narratives with larger, more universal implications.

Sonambulo II (Blue) speaks precisely to the crucial intersection film, existing architectural space; 13 min. loop between his earlier street-based endeavors and his later, more gallery-bound Jacob and Bessie Levy Art Encouragement practice. Importantly, it exists as both an individual work of sound art and a site- Fund, 1999.299 specific installation commissioned by the Art Institute. Consisting mainly of the soothing sounds of a summer thunder- and rainstorm, the audio portion mimics a New Age relaxation tape or therapeutic sleep aid. The origins of the work, however, are quite different: the audio was composed from the sound of a single gunshot that the artist sampled and digitally remastered using state- of-the-art computer editing equipment. The sound loop begins with the explosion of the gunshot, which is followed by eight seconds of tense silence. The gunshot sound is then repeated 385,000 times and seamlessly blended with the beginnings of the simulated thunder. The rainstorm effect follows, and the piece automatically repeats. The conceptual roots of the work can be found in Manglano-Ovalle's biography. An insomniac, he decided to construct his own relaxation tape directly from the very street noises that were contributing to his sleeplessness. Placing a microphone outside his bedroom window on Chicago's Northwest Side, he captured the sound of gunfire in a single night.1 In a poignant act of creative transformation, the artist constructed an escape based in reality, turning the potentially frightening sounds of violence into a soothing means of respite. Sound itself, however, is also a major focus of his thinking: "I don't use sound in a linear, time-based way. To me sound is very much an extension of sculpture. It has physical form to me. It drives and also occupies space."2 Sonambulo II (Blue) is much more than a personal lullaby: Manglano-Ovalle's strikingly inventive manipulations contain a compelling social critique. The ref- erences to sleep introduce the metaphor of unconsciousness and consciousness. Extending these into the arena of pressing political issues such as gun violence, the work points to the basic differences between awareness and ignorance, social action and neglect. The piece masks the sounds of gunfire with the effect of a natural phenomenon; in doing so, it suggests the ways in which violence and fear too often become the ambient backdrop of contemporary urban life. In the Art Institute's 1999 installation, shown here, viewers were invited to expe- rience the work's artificial nature while contemplating the actual urban landscape, which was beautifully framed by a wall of tall glass windows in the museum's Rice Loggia. Hermetically insulated from the exigencies of day-to-day street life, visitors were actually suspended above the cityscape. This artifice, further heightened by thé blue tint of the windows, created the effect of imitation rain meeting imitation sky.

These works are often low-tech and employ highly economical means of shooting, such as a fixed camera, limited angles, or slow pans. Although many of her films are based loosely on a fictional or historical tale, the artist's real power lies DÌSCtDD6CLrCLlìC6 OLt S&amp;CL II not m storyteUmg but in her adeptness with the medium of film itself. Her narratives r . are deeply rooted in film's relationship to light and time, and to the reflexive and (Voyage de GueriSOn) r . circuitous nature of both these elements. 1997 Disappearance at Sea II (Voyage de Guérison) is the title of a short film made after Disappearance at Sea (CinemaScope) (1996). Both works take as their point 16mm anamorphic color film, optical sound; r , , r r' u ^ 1 1 r-cij 01 r departure , the story or r Donald r' u Crowhurst, ^ 1 an amateur yachtsman 1 trom r-cij England who joined the solo, round-the-world Sunday Times Golden Globe Race in 1968. Gift of Society for Contemporary Art, 2000.97 The inexper¡enced (and, some might say, deceptive) Crowhurst quickly ran into difficulties, and eventually his craft, the Teignmouth Electron^ was found several hundred miles from the coast of Britain, abandoned.1 Filmed in panoramic format in northeast England, Disappearance at Sea (CinemaScope) uses the lights of Berwick Lighthouse and the surrounding landscape to suggestive narrative ends. The title oí Disappearance at Sea II (Voyage de Guérison) refers to the medieval legend of Tristan and Isolde's misguided, love-potion-induced affair. Tristan, unlike Crowhurst, embraced the ocean's power: after being mortally wounded, he allowed 36</page><page sequence="28">himself to drift in a voyage de guérison, or journey of healing, to a magical island where he hoped to be cured once again by the powers of Isolde and her mother, the queen. Dean set the film at the Longstone Lighthouse in the Farne Islands, mounting the camera on the building's lighting apparatus. Using a wide-screen format, she confined her exploration to a single continuous shot. The uninterrupted rotation captures the reflections in the building's curved windows and an endless pan of the surrounding sea and sky. The implied narrative is one of silent, ceaseless waiting for a loved one to return from the sea; during exhibition, sound is confined to the light's mechanism and the rhythmic clicking of the projector, with the whirring of the film reel echoing the sound of the rotating lighthouse. Reflecting on Dean's oeuvre, the novelist Jeannette Winterson wrote: "The vividness of her images and the vibrancy of her soundscapes are a challenge to the desensitised, coarse world of normal experience, where bright lights, movement and noise cheat us into believing that something is happening. Tacita Dean's slow nothingness is far more rich and strange."2 Indeed, in this artist's work, real and cinematic space become analogous, forming an elegant symmetry between medium and subject.3 Disappearance at Sea II, like its companion, is ultimately about the phenomenon of projection, of a beam of light being transmitted through a lens - in actuality, the essence of film.4 N.R. 37</page><page sequence="29">Rineke Dijkstra Dutch, born 1959 AtltlBtTtick FcbrUCltY 77 1QQ7 Rineke Dijkstra practices an art of quiet, engaged observation. Since she began exhibiting her photographic work in 1993, she has developed an international reputation as one of the most visible and highly regarded Dutch artists of her Color video, sound (projection); 4 min. loop generation. She is known for flat, frontal, color portraits of individuals that are Modern and Contemporary Discretionary Fund, characterized by a remarkable formal classicism, conceptual rigor, and psychological 2000 312 depth. Of her work, the artist has commented, "I discovered that if you want to give a general impression, you should be very specific."1 In the series Beach Portraits, for instance, she depicts her subjects within a precise geographic setting yet avoids identifying them by name.2 Although video is somewhat of an anomaly in Dijkstra's oeuvre, her earliest attempts in the medium, like her photographs, focus on the tender aspects of teenage sexuality and social behavior. For instance, both Buzz Club I 'My stery world (199 7) and Annemiek, February 11, 199/ feature subjects that were filmed alone or in groups, appearing before a blank white background. Buzz /Club, however, grounds these individuals within their wider location - a nightclub in Liverpool - through the use of ambient noise as well as through their unselfconsciousness in front of the camera; although they stand in front of a screen, they continue to smoke, dance, and chew gum. In this way, Buzz Club serves as a stylistic and compositional bridgp between Dijsktra's photographic portraits and Annemiek. Dijkstra shot Annemiek with a single fixed camera, and only the subject's head and shoulders are visible in the frame. The work features an adolescent Dutch girl alone before the camera, lip-synching the ballad "I Wanna Be With You" by the popular American teen band the Backstreet Boys. As the music starts, Annemiek appears nervous and embarrassed, but only moments later she furrows her brow in a momentary lapse of self-consciousness, allowingherself to intimate the lyrics' passion. Quickly catching herself, she manages a bashful smile. Throughout the video, she continues to struggle between this adolescent awkwardness and adult confidence.

A white TcCirS fOY EyOS man ^rom a working-class Afrikaans family, the artist has developed a practice that engages with the turbulent revolution surrounding the downfall of apartheid and the burden of his country's past. In the late 1990s, he began creating intense, unsettling Color video* sound (five monitors), metal video installations that reshape imagery from Hollywood films to delve into themes scaffolding; dimensions vary with installation . of collective guilt, confrontation, and violence. Donna and Howard Stone New Media Fund, Tears for Eros consists of five video monitors supported by scaffolds, an arrange- 2000.48 ment that Geers refers to as "information towers." Each channel presents close-up footage, appropriated from David Lynch's debut film Blue Velvet (1986), of a severed human ear lying in a field of grass. In quickly edited sequences, an army of black ants moves in and around the ear, accompanied by the ambient noise of cicadas and chirping crickets. Although the color balance and tone of each monitor is different, the sequence appears to be nearly identical on all five channels, generating a relentless, numbing effect. Careful scrutiny reveals that the respective visuals are in fact composed of many different edits of the sequence, and the audio - similarly misleading - is a manipulated version of the movie's soundtrack that incorporates electronic noise and recordings of heavy industry. In this chilling tableau, hints of violence and decay are inextricably linked to the natural landscape. The image of a severed ear itself is hardly coincidental: through manipulations of one powerful moment from Lynch's film, Geers suggests a condition in which we are stripped of our own senses, bereft of an ability to discern truth from fiction. 40 KL</page><page sequence="32">I- I pi pn K/lirr^i Helen Mirra's widely varied production includes film, poetry, recorded music, sculpture, and video. Like many other practitioners of her generation, she has adopted American, born 1970 and reconfigured the strategies of Conceptual Art to personal, often narrative, ends. Much of her work pairs ideas of travel and labor, with particular attention to themes of landscape, the sea, and childhood. Restricted to a palette of drab greens, browns, MCLD of PciKCtllcl Ç2 North an&lt;^ blues, her creations are distinctly evocative of the natural landscape. Q I r ^' r Map of Parallel 52 North at a Scale of One Foot to One Degree represents an ill U OLUlt UJ 'JTiV rUUL LU imaginary aerial circumnavigation of the globe, beginning and ending off the coast of 0/16 D 6^66 Labrador.

Vielehr Prize Fund, 2001485 many of her sculptures, the film is displayed at floor level; the presence of the reel, can, and lid within a nearby vitrine draws further attention to the work's materiality. On the film itself, meandering brushstrokes send viewers into a sort of reverie, as the visual information flickers and moves too quickly to be followed. The artist eschewed traditional cartography in favor of translating the geography of this line of longitude into green and blue watercolor washes that represent land and water, and that were painted directly onto the film's clear surface. In particular, the rapid variations in brightness of color recall flicker films, which are characterized by a similar visual quality and induce equally trancelike effects. Evoking the histories and practices of film, painting, and sculpture, Mirra's work is a quietly powerful meditation on the human practice of understanding the world. K.M.B. 41</page><page sequence="33">Joshua Mosley American, born 1974 B€VrOUth Joshua Mosley 's stunning, often cryptic work, which involves a labor-intensive combination of drawing, high-definition video, photography, and sculpted stop- motion figures, has redirected the leading edge of animation technology away from Digital color video, sound (projection); its origins in collective production models and commercial applications, and into the 9 min. loop visionary realm of the individual artist and the fine-art short film.1 Pauline Palmer Prize Fund, 2003.87 ^n Beyrouth (at top), Mosley depicts an imaginary philosophical debate between his Lebanese grandfather, represented by a twelve-year-old boy in braids, and his great- grandfather, portrayed as a white donkey. The piece has its origins in a libretto that was inspired by the artist's conversations with his grandfather, an etching by Francisco de A VU6 Goya featuring a donkey, and English translations of short stories by the Argentine 2QQA writer Julio Cortázar. Mosley wrote his libretto in English, translated it into Spanish, back into English, and finally into Arabic. Like much of his work, including A Vue High-definition color video, sound and dread, Beyrouth explores the behavioral rules of conversation and the structure (projection); 730 mm. loop of dialogue. 'n tnis caSe, the libretto developed into an operatic soundtrack created Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 200745 in collaboration with composer Toufic Farroukh and inserted within the enigmatic, dreamlike film. A Vue (at middle) recounts the story of Henry, a park ranger who has devoted his life to maintaining a gigantic bronze statue of George Washington Carver. The UÏ6CtCl narrative develops when Henry meets Susan, who works at a fiber optics company. 2007 As the couple discuss the relationship between their lives and their jobs, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish an admirable task from a meaningless one. The High-definition color video, sound statue of Caryer remains motionless while ink wash drawings move unsteadily around it. Serving as an exploration of dedication to work rather than a mere tribute Wilson LMead Fund, 2008.80 to an American hero, it symbolizes the dichotomy inherent in work, questioning whether this common means of self-definition might instead be a mechanism for self- obliteration. The musical score, written in collaboration with Abby Schneider, adds a grim intensity to the piece. The dialogue in dread (at bottom), meanwhile, is loosely based on the artist's reading of Blaise Pascal's Pensées (1670) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Emile (1762). Mosley was interested in the way that both texts "present the difficulty of resolving the human relationship to nature and existence while also accepting God as the creator."2 Here, the two philosophers encounter each other in a forest landscape and engage in a brief, esoteric debate that cannot be resolved; they are accompanied all the while by an original soundtrack made up of an intricate assembly of short recordings of single notes. The work's title refers to a huge dog that brings the men's deliberations to an untimely end. The animal's name and form recall the subject of Eadweard Muybridge's photographic motion study Dog; Trotting; Mastiff-Dread (1884/87), alluding both to the culture of nineteenth-century scientific investigation and to Muybridge's experiments as precursors to the motion picture.

On the one hand, this is a place the artist has seen before: she lived in Uganda as a child, until General Idi Amin expelled thousands of 16mm color film, sound, transferred to digital South Asians from the country. On the other hand, however, she has made it clear video (projection); 24:25 min. loop that Out of Blue thoroughly transcends any biographical concerns: "The work is not Restricted gift of Barbara Ruben in memory of a personal indulgence; it is about making sense through the medium of aesthetics. It is Thomas H. Ruben, 2004.147 a question that is close to my heart since the significant ethical issues have a resonance for me. I want to register these issues, to mark what has happened: elimination, extermination, and erasure."1 Addressing these concerns through visual metaphors, Bhimji shaped Out of Blue by paying close attention to the intense beauty of her physical surroundings. For instance, the opening scenes show an expansive view of a verdant landscape that is soon overtaken by the crackle of flames and an all-encompassing fire. This conflagration perhaps recalls disturbances in places such as Kosovo, Rwanda, and Uganda - events, both personal and public, that continue to resonate in our consciousness. The fire also, however, serves as a dynamic formal element, since Bhimji is considering landscape in the broadest of ways. According to the artist, "It is the tension of translation, the exchange, the resonance between an extremely beautiful still landscape anc} the one on fire that gives energy and defines reality."2 In Out of Blue, the camera searches empty locations such as disused refugee dwellings, cemeteries, prison cells, and schoolyards, places that at once evoke British colonial rule and, more importantly, possess an evocative visual atmosphere. Bhimji also often focuses on the banal signs of present-day life: birds, insects, mats, and pots on the stove. Gunshots and chaotic voices are mixed into the soundscape, creating a sense of impending tragedy. The soundtrack inoludes the words of Sufi vocalist Abida Parveen, Idi Amin's radio announcements, children's voices, a woman's sobs, and layers of ambient sounds. In fact, the artist works with composers and does extensive research with sound archives prior to making a series of photographs or a film, creating her soundtracks independently and adding them in at the last phase of production. Out of Blue's final scenes settle on Uganda's now-abandoned Entebbe International Airport, where tens of thousands of refugees attempted to leave the country. Here we witness the frenzied activity of ants taking over the deserted compound in a scene overlaid with chaotic music, mass voices, and sounds of struggle. According to the artist, Out of Blue is, in its essence, neither memoir nor protest, but rather an open-ended, more purely aesthetic engagement with the processes of looking and understanding. "My work," she explained, "is about learning to listen to difference in its various forms. Listening with the eyes, listening to change in tone, difference of colour. It is not about capturing an existing thing; it is about creating a new one."3 N.R. 44</page><page sequence="36">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="37">Charles Ray American, born 1953 FCLShiOYlS Since the early 1970s, Los Angeles-based artist Charles Ray has produced sculptural works that disorient viewers and command space in unusual ways, exploring its aesthetic and psychological implications. Influenced in part by the simplicity, 16mm color film, silent, projector, pedestal, and emotional blankness, and serial quality of Minimalism, Ray chooses subjects seating; 1230 min. that may at first seem simple but, upon closer observation, reveal an ambitious Pauline Palmer Prize Fund, 2004150 combination of formalism and technical complexity. Viewers experience cognitive dissonance when encountering Ray's works, which include life-size or larger than life-size mannequins and everyday objects. The artist's hyperbolic presentation of the real, whether overexaggerated - or, as in Fashions, underexaggerated - turns the ordinary into the hallucinatory. In this, his only completed film, Ray shows his friend and former student Frances Stark, now a noted artist, modeling one hundred original outfits while rotating slowly on a small platform that he controlled. Standing in contrapposto, Stark attempts to mimic both the stoic pose of a classical statue and the stiffness of a modern commercial mannequin. However, her clearly visible tattoo, uneven tan lines, and blinking eyes signal that she is real. Given Ray's ongoing quest to at once objectify the living and animate the lifeless, Fashions is unusual in that humanity prevails. As the title indicates, the focus is on the clothes, which Ray designed and then stapled or taped together. At the end of each rotation of the platform, the film cuts to a new ensemble, with absolutely no other action. As Ray described it, Stark becomes an "armature" on which to build his work, a means "to show off the labor."1 Fashion is also used as a metaphor for identity; it can be interpreted differently depending on the beholder, fostering a false intimacy between the subject and viewer. Fashions combines the ideas appearing in Ray's previous work with mannequins; his photographic piece All My Clothes (1973); and the sculptural Tabletop (1989), in which a bowl, potted plant, and other objects rotate slowly on a table.2 According to the artist, Fashions also recalls his sculptural piece Puzzle Bottle (1973), for which he sealed a scaled-down figure of himself in a bottle, forming an abstract space that exists outside of time.3 A film installation that should be viewed from beginning to end, Fashions is meant to be shown with a whirring, flickering 16mm film projector, a nearly outmoded format reminiscent of the ones used in Ray's high school.4 The size, rotational speed, and mechanical movement of the film reel echoes that of Stark's platform, collapsing the difference between the projector and the image it displays.

His distinctive approach is equal parts documentary, transcendental rumination, and visual essay. A Season Outside, a subtle 16mm color film, sound, transferred to digital and poetic work written and narrated by the unseen artist, reveals the anxiety that video (projection); 30 min. loop surrounds the militarized border between India and Pakistan. Partition, the British Restricted gift of Martin Friedman and government's 1947 division of the Indian subcontinent into two nations - Hindu- Peggy Casey- Fried man; Contemporary Art majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan - left millions of people on the wrong Discretionary Fund, 2004481 side of a border, causing violence that has since escalated into an arms race. Meanwhile, the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, which was defined by nonviolent resistance to British rule and an attempt to reconcile distinct classes and religions, has been diminished by India's Hindu nationalist movement. Kanwar's film opens with the sunset ritual of closing the gate on the border at Wagah- Atari, where military personnel engage in displays of nationalistic aggression before crowds of spectators on either side. This stagçd conflict, which is accompanied by a voiceover in which the artist quietly intimates that violence also occurred in his own family, shows how pervasively physical aggression may infect both cultures and individual human minds. While Kanwar engages in personal reflections, suggesting an evolution in his attitude toward Gandhi's stance of pacifism as intervention, he juxtaposes these with images of enforced division, theatrical military posturing, and real violence: protesters are beaten by police; men cheer as two rams butt and lock horns; an older child pushes a younger one down; birds peck at a stray dog. The artist has said, "There is perhaps no border outpost in the world quite like Wagah ... an outpost where every evening people are drawn to a thin white line . . . and probably anyone in the eye of a conflict could find themselves here. A Season Outside is a personal and philosophical journey through the shadows of ^ast generations, conflicting positions, borders and time zones - a nomad wandering through lines of separation, examining the scars of violence and dreams of hope scattered among communities and nations."1 While A Season Outside seems to be a documentary, it is presented in an abstract manner more conducive to an aesthetic or emotional effect than to exposé. The film's soulful, elegiac audio track bears a direct but entirely nondidactic, nonjournalistic relationship to its imagery. Kanwar uses his voice to address unflinchingly, in the most personal terms, the human impulse for violence. Yet his visual approaches to the subject are mostly indirect, through metaphorical or reenacted conflict. The work's title denotes a space or time removed from the brutality depicted within, perhaps suggesting the hope that, at some point, there might exist a possibility for peaceful cohabitation, if not reconciliation.

Although candid in appearance, her films Donald L Davis; Contemporary Art slowly reveal themselves to be the result of elaborate preparation and extensive Discretionary and The Orbit funds, 2004482 collaboration with her subjects. Filmed in a continuous take with a fixed-angle camera, NO captures Masa and Yoko Ito, a Japanese farming couple, systematically mulching a plot of land. For over half an hour, they arrange tidy piles of straw and then disperse them over a field with minimalist, almost sculptural precision. Lockhart presents, documentary- style, a temporal sequence of events, but the film resists any clear narrative. Viewers share in a sense of discovery by watching the performance, yet they are actually being offered a sort of hyper-reality: the artist creates expectations that do not seem to correspond to the disproportionate attention she has paid to her mundane subject. Lockhart described her process in the following way: "I organized NO around the optics of seeing ... I had the farmers make piles of hay in the reverse perspective of the camera, following the camera's field of vision. . . . After working from background to foreground to make the piles, the farmers come in and slowly spread the hay over just that portion of the field revealed by the camera, from foreground to background, as if they are covering a canvas."2 As the figures move through horizontal fields of color in a choreographed fashion, Lockhart's film appears almost as a living landscape painting. This work is inspired by Nõ-no ikebana, a freestyle form of Japanese flower arranging. The practice is based upon the cycles.and rules of agriculture, using fruits and vegetables directly from the farm. As Lockhart has explained, "It highlights a relationship to nature and farming that is somewhat contrary to the overly mechanized large-scale agribusiness prevalent in the United States."3 N.R. 50</page><page sequence="42">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="43">Eija-Liïsa Ahtila Finnish, born 1959 Tctlo/Thß HOÜSC Culled from research and interviews with individuals suffering from psychotic disorders, Eija-Liisa Ahtila's films are sensual, profoundly moving vignettes.

The film opens with a woman driving up to a secluded house,an the woods. Through a series of fixed camera angles that recall surveillance-camera footage in their passivity and fragmentation, Ahtila describes the interior of the house and its surroundings in vibrant, contrasting colors and lush images. As the film progresses, the protagonist hears voices, her awareness of her environment beginning to disintegrate. She describes her experience to the viewer, stating, "Everything is now simultaneous, here, being. Nothing happens before or after. Things don't have causes. Things that occur no longer shed light on the past. Time is random and spaces have become overlapping. No place is just one anymore." As the woman's perceptions unravel, the images become increasingly dreamlike, eventually creating a complete rupture of spatial and temporal boundaries. In one scene, she floats slowly through the trees outside her home, gently brushing against the branches; ia another, her car drives around the walls of her house. At varying intervals, she turns to face the camera, confiding in the viewer directly. In an effort to isolate the splintering images' and sounds, the woman sews dark curtains and covers the windows. The screens go dark as she states, "When I don't see anything, I'm where the sounds are. In the street, on the shore, in the ship." As the work reaches its conclusion, the protagonist is enveloped in the shadow and solitude of her home, the tension occurring onscreen reflecting the claustrophobia of the darkened* exhibition space.

At the same time, the films in her Cave trilogy (2002-03), Lasso, Thriller, and Cave, skillfully distill cinematic 35mm color film, stereo sound, transferred to genres such as the horror film or the western, drawing out social themes. Tykkä has digital video (projection); 348 min. loop commented, "In Lasso, I approached westerns, which I adored in my youth, their Restricted gifts of Stephanie Skestos Gabriele black-and-white set of values reminding me of the society I lived in. I was touched by and Dirk Den ¡son, 2005.21 the questions these films raised about power and by what kind of roles women played in these films and how."1 Lasso explores the passage from childhood to adulthood with a grand sensibility. The video begins as a jogger returns from a run in the suburbs of Helsinki, catching her breath as she approaches a front door. Ringing the bell and trying the locked door, she walks around to the back of the house, where she comes upon a series of full-length windows. At first, her reflection is seen in the pane, but as she approaches to peer through the Venetian blinds, the camera reveals the interior of the house. A young man, stripped to the waist and barefoot, is deep in concentration as he swings a lasso. The camera eventually returns to the woman, her eyes and tear-stained cheeks visible through the slats of the blinds. The music for Lasso, equal parts poignant and farcical, is borrowed from pompöser Ennio Morricone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1969), a selection that equates this classic "spaghetti" western with the faux rodeo antics of Tykkä's male protagonist. Coupled with his graceful movements, the mise-en-scène hypnotically draws viewers into the same trance the female character has fallen under. This spell is broken when the young man falls to his knees and forcefully crashes the lasso against the floor, at which point the jogger backs slowly away from the window, leaving behind a trace of her breath on the glass. According to Tykkä, the original script for Lasso was "a story about a young woman in whose everyday life subconscious visions intrude, shattering her reality into pieces."2 The film focuses on what is seemingly a fragment of a much larger narrative.

This generic and spatial fluidity also blurs conventional boundaries between the work and the viewer. The artist also insists on revealing, through the construction of her works them- selves, how images are made and the conditions in which they are presented, Delphine, for instance, was shot with four pieces of equipment simultaneously: scuba divers held two digital video cameras, and two Super 8 cameras were used by crew members wearing only snorkel gear. Thus the shots from the bottom looking up are all on video, and the shots from the top looking down are all on film. These were intercut without regard for separating the different media; film and video are both visible. Clarity and atmosphere, grain and line flow into one another, and the perceived immediacy and flatness of video and the perceived memory and depth of film give way to and mutually reinforce or deconstruct one another. These self-conscious production methods are mirrored by Thater's particular aesthetic of presentation: she always leaves the equipment in full view inside the installation. This transparent approach, the artist insisted, *does not, as some people might have us believe, preclude transcendence. This is ultimately my point - that neither magic or superficial beauty is required to approach the sublime."4 J.R. 56</page><page sequence="48">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="49">Rodney Graham Canadian, born 1949 TOYQ[XG(l ChCMClcliCÏ RclCClSC Vancouver-based Rodney Graham has adopted a variety of roles as an artist - musician, performer, philosopher, scientist, and writer - but he has been primarily recognized for his moving-image installations in varying formats of film and video. 35mm color film, silent (custom film projector at A nimble and rigorous reinvestigation of 1970s Conceptualism, Graham's oeuvre has 48fps);5 min. loop led him to be described as an artist who works on "multiple tracks" rather than in Major Acquisitions Fund, 2005.292 sequential stages.1 Torqued Chandelier Release is the third - and most ambitious - of a trio of films that the artist described as "illustrated 'thought experiments' documenting transitory lighting events within the context of a single roll of film."2 Inspired by Sir Isaac Newton's famous water-bucket experiment, which explored the nature of rotational motion, Torqued Chandelier Release documents a crystal chandelier - wound up on a rope off-camera and then released - spinning in one direction until the rope unwinds, slowing, then spinning in the reverse direction, and so on, until finally coming to rest. The film was shot at twice the normal speed with a 35 mm camera placed on its side, and is shown in a vertical format through a custom-built, high-speed projector. The image of the spinning chandelier becomes hypnotic - it takes on a sculptural, three-dimensional appearance that is unlike anything made by conventional filmic means; the intensified resolution and lush texture transform the simple event into a dizzying, glamorous spectacle. As Christina Bagatavicius has explained, however, all this glitter is used to make a historical and intellectual point as well: "The luminosity of the chandelier also takes on a richer meaning when related back to Newton's status as a central thinker during the age of Enlightenment. Within this context, the chandelier takes on the dual role of recreating a historical experiment as well as cleverly personifying the illumination of the mind through thought."3 Graham's deadpan humor permeates his work. Here, he chose the image of the chandelier from his memory of an incident in the 1952 film Scaramouche, in which the lead character is nearly impaled by a falling chandelier (yet another Newtonian lesson) and escapes his enemies in the guise of a Commedia dell'Arte buffoon. Likewise, Graham often conceals his own identity - in this case, as an artist-cum-experimental scientist - as a means of subverting the authorship, originality, and identity issues that have been at the forefront of contemporary art discourse for the last two decades.

All of the things that I see socially- the social conditions of racism - come out like a sweat."1 Phat Free begins with several minutes of darkness overlaid with an unidentifiable loud, metallic sound. As the video image is revealed, a man - Hammons himself - appears dressed in a long coat, felt hat, and sneakers, kicking a metal bucket down a deserted city sidewalk late at night. The work was shot in 1995 to document Hammons's late-night performance and edited into an independent video work four years later. At first seemingly violent, the noise evolves into an almost musical rhythm that is synchronized with the protagonist's methodical movements. The title elaborates this musical allusion, conjuring both the streetwise lyricism of rap and hip- hop and the improvisational nature of jazz. The video's rough, grainy texture communicates the harsh reality of life on the streets and also evokes the early performance videos of Vito Acconci (see pp. 66-6 j), Bruce Nauman (see pp. 18-21), and others. In and of itself, the action of kicking the bucket suggests the man's potentially unfortunate fate.

The adoption of this technology as an Martin and Danielle Zimmerman, 2006.158 artistic vehicle, which emerged from the Conceptual and experimental film and video movements of the 1960s and 1970s, was centered in public, performance-based work.1 As the medium began to enjoy a growing presence in the art world, The Ballad took shape as a self-contained piece with a dedicated soundtrack, codifying earlier, more performative presentations of the work in the clubs and cinemas of New York's artistic demimonde. Continuing to embrace the humble analog quality of the slide show format was an important aesthetic and artistic decision on the part of the artist, who now has at her disposal an array of more technologically advanced methods of multi-image display. Goldin's installation offers up a more exposed and potentially more honest version of the garden- variety domestic slide show ritual, capturing the very sort of subjects and events that are considered outside normative notions of identity, relationships, and community.2 Viewers see the artist, her friends, and family in experiences of the utmost intimacy - lovemaking, violence, addiction, hospitalization - and witness the rollercoaster of emotions that accompany them.3 Goldin's basic strategy of making the private public, however, anticipated the effects of Facebook, MySpace, and other new media that have changed the shape of the average person's experience in ways even she may not have expected. The Ballad represents the first joint acquisition between the Art Institute's departments of Contemporary Art and Photography, signaling its landmark status not only within Goldin's oeuvre, but also as a slide installation that charted new territory in the history of film, video, new media, and photography.

The son of Surrealist painter Roberto Matta, he studied architecture at Cornell University from 1962 to Super 8 black-and-white and color film, silent, 196$; there, he met sculptor Robert Smithson, whose interests in land art and the transferred to 16mm film; 10:50 min. theory of entropy influenced him significantly. After completing his studies, he moved Restricted gift of Dirk S. Denison, 2006.747 to New York ancI became a well-known figure among artists in the burgeoning avant- garde scene centered in Soho. Matta-Clark's principal contribution was as a radical sculptor: he is recognized for his series of "building cuts" (1972-78), in which he carved out sections of entire structures, treating them as spatial compositions. Calling these transformations "Anarchitecture," the artist documented them in films and photographs that were subsequently exhibited in galleries, often alongside fragments of the buildings themselves.1 One of his most celebrated sculptures consisted of a vertical slice into an old frame house located in Englewood, New Jersey. The jiome, owned by New York art dealer Holly Solomon, was slated for demolition. The resulting film is composed of intentionally artless footage showing Matta-Clark and his friends making two parallel cuts down the center of the house; jacking up one half of the structure and beveling the cinderblock supporting it; and then lowering that half back down, bisecting the home and creating an ephemeral display of light inside the once-compartmentalized interior. The movie's documentary style is the result of the artist's dramatically physical approach to filmmaking. It reveals Matta-Clark as a daredevil, climbing around a structure that has nothing but a few jacks preventing it from collapse. The sequences, which study the light effects produced by the building cut, reveal a domestic space transformed into a sundial on a grand scale. After he created Splitting, Matta-Clark invited select members of the art com- munity to travel by bus to the home and see it firsthand, an act that was not without some physical risk to the out-of -place gallery-goers. Three months later, the house was leveled. While the majority of the artist's projects were only meant to exist temporarily, films such as Splitting preserve the ephemeral nature of his approach and also remain as important works of art in their own right.2 Indeed, Splitting has been remembered as "one of the premier moments of a period in which anarchistic, architecturally oriented sculpture coexisted with Conceptual art."3 During his short career - he died of cancer at age thirty-five - Matta-Clark made over twenty films documenting his architectural explorations and interventions; these have become an extremely important influence for contemporary artists such as Matthew Barney, Pierre Huyghe (see pp. 68-69), and Rachel Whiteread.

All three were made in the 1970s - a time of significant change for the medium - and exemplify important aspects of its technological and conceptual evolution.1 Video art embraced all of the disciplines prevalent during the decade - sculpture, language, and especially performance - but also quickly emerged as its own field. Within its parameters, artists could explore the intimate relationship between performer and audience in the context of real time. In Centers (at top), Acconci's finger wags slightly as he tries to hold still, pointing at himself, the camera, and the viewer. He wears a look of confrontation: as he stares intently outward, we look back, forming an uneasy connection. In Baldessari Sings LeWitt (at middle), the artist enters the frame, sits in a chair, and speaks in a conversational tone to his audience. Like Acconci, Baldessari serves as the subject of his own work as he sings Sol LeWitt's "35 Sentences on Conceptual Art" (1969) to familiar tunes. By using their own bodies, the artists engender a human closeness with the viewer. Birnbaum's Technology/Transformation (at bottom) is a little different in this regard, as she chose to feature not herself, but an appropriated image of Wonder Woman, who spins endlessly in the video. But the work rightly assumes that the audience is already familiar with Wonder Woman as a pop-culture icon, so in some sense intimacy already exists. This closeness between performer and viewer is heightened by the passing of time. Acconci confronts his audience for over twenty minutes, testing both their endurance and his own in an increasingly intense and meaningful way. While Baldessari delivers his songs, viewers have the chance to adjust to their initial surprise at his playful delivery of high-art Conceptualism and develop questions about LeWitt's rules and the very definitions of art. Birnbaum cuts and repeats the image of a spinning Wonder Woman into easily consumed chunks of time; the constant pop that signals her transformation creates a staccato soundtrack. The audience witnesses her change over and over again, which perhaps reinforces the underlying impression that an ordinary woman must metamorphose into a superhero in order to succeed. In different ways, all three artists create the opportunity for viewers to challenge both the way they perceive art and relate to its makers.

Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 2007.31 Huyghe's video installation Les Grands Ensembles (The Housing Projects) presents a fixed view of two residential towers in a bleak urban landscape, swathed in fog at night. Lacking any signs of human activity, the buildings appear to take on lives of their own as the video's buzzing electronic soundtrack, composed by Pan Sonic and Cédric Pigot, builds in intensity. Windows in the two facades beg;n to light up rhythmically and with increasing frequency, as if communicating in some sort of code. The towers, which are actually models the artist created in a film^tudio, echo French government housing projects common in the 1970s, but they do not represent specific buildings. Instead, they can be seen as archetypes, standing in for the Modernist program in architecture and the social agendas to which it was tied. Meanwhile, the audio track is reminiscent of experimental directions in electronic music in the same era, reinforcing this historical allusion. The video is a reflection on the failures of Utopian Modernism, signaled in part by the desolate mise-en-scène. This familiar narrative, however, ultimately gives way to the volley of lights, a mysterious cipher that resists attempts at interpretation. A landmark project for Huyghe, Les Grands Ensembles premiered at the 2001 Venice Biennale as part of the artist's installation of the French Pavilion. There it was accompanied by other works, such as Atari Light (1999), a room-sized version of the early video game Pong, which visitors could play on illuminated ceiling panels that evoked a Modernist grid. Huyghe installed the works in multiple rooms, separated by doors with modulating levels of transparency, to create what he described as "a blinking organism" - a constellation of associations and disjunctions that shifted as lines of sight opened up and disappeared.1 Interweaving themes from the histories of architecture, design, and popular culture, Huyghe invites viewers to consider our relationship with the overdetermined, highly coded world of mass-media representations. Les Grands Ensembles, for its part, introduces the artist's engagement with forms of spectacle and the cultural conditions that emerge from them. The flashing lights that play across the facades of these buildings, repeated in an endless video loop, seem to ask whether this is a stream of coded information waiting to be translated or a deluge of vacant representation, a spectacle pointing to nothing but itself.

Growing up in the working-class town of Wigan, near Manchester in northern England, the artist spent much of his leisure time 8mm black-and-white and color film, sound, as a train-spotter; this enthusiasm has motivated his exploration of time structures transferred to digital video (projection); and transportation systems - clocks and trains appear often in his work. Not unlike 12 min. loop the physicist Albert Einstein, who coincidentally used the example of a clock on a Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 2007.32 train to explain the space-time continuum, Almond explores the ways in which these seemingly fixed factors are in fact reciprocal and relative.1 The first of a trilogy of short films based on trains, Schwebebahn features one of the oldest, most unusual, and still notably efficient public transportation systems in the world: the suspended monorail system in Wuppertal,. Germany, built between 1898 and 1 90 1. Using a handheld Super 8 camera and shootingjrom several vantage points within the train cars, Almond produced footage that was, as Martin Herbert described it, "Inverted, reversed, and retarded ... so that the train appeared to be above the rail and the landscape below appeared to be above and upside-down. In slow-motion, the experience of riding the rails. . . became a kind of suspended animation in a parallel universe."2 In Almond's disorienting world, the viewer's experience of gravity and perception is unbalanced: the horizon is misleading, and time and movement are cyclical, reversed. This defamiliarizing sensation is further heightened by a soundtrack of hypnotic electronic music. The two other films in the trilogy are Geisterbahn, or Ghost Train (1999), which documents a shadowy ride through a haunted house in Vienna that was rebuilt after World War II, and In the Between (2006), a three-screen protective installation that follows the recently opened railway from Xining, China, to Lhasa, Tibet, with symbolic vignettes from each of the once completely isolated areas. Throughout his oeuvre, Almond acknowledges the passing of time and its inevitable consequences, whatever they may be. Without judgment, he creates poetic comparisons between our analog past and the increasing speed of the digital age.

Another of Aitken's voyages - in this case to* a glacier in Alaska - inspired thaw, which depicts a landscape that is austere and seemingly free from the touch of human history. In this three-channel projection, expansive views of moving clouds and bright sun give way to images of melting snow and sheets of ice breaking off into the exposed sea. Perhaps first and foremost, thaw (at bottom) is an overtly sensual experience, filtered through and heightened by technology. At times, the images on the angled, adjoining screens merge to create an expansive panorama, while at other moments Aitken inverts an image to produce a disorienting effect or introduces an unexpected sensation of rhythm by juxtaposing close-ups of cracking ice or water droplets. Meanwhile, the layered, pulsing audio track contributes to a sense of volatility and movement, amplifying the quality of technological mediation as one views the glacial landscape. For the audio, the artist recorded ambient noises on location and later combined them with additional sounds that he synthesized electronically. Presenting a fractured, kinetic portrait of this place, he conveys through largely formal means the hidden dynamism of the arctic terrain as it shifts between solid and liquid states. 72</page><page sequence="64">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="65">If Aitken's projects often describe how technology shapes our relation to place and our ways of being in the world, in a more abstract manner the artist explores how technology and motion can inform our notions of space and time. In a brief but prescient passage in a 1950 essay, the philosopher Martin Heidegger described how developments in the technology of media (film, radio, and television) and transportation (the railroad and the automobile) gave rise to a condition of uniform "distancelessness" in which "everything is equally far and equally near."2 Aitken's art seems to focus on these cultural conditions in an advanced state, more than forty years later. He has remarked, "On some level, all of my work is related to what I see as certain new tendencies in the culture . . . Accelerated nomadicism, self-contained, decentralized communication - these things are at the core of the space we're living in, a terrain that is radically different from the past."3 Of all his works, Aitken's large-scale video installation the moment (opposite) perhaps deals with these ideas most explicitly. The installation consists of eleven screens suspended from the ceiling in an S-pattern and, as the video begins, the darkened gallery resounds with a hushed whisper that declares "I want to be every place." The piece then presents a tightly orchestrated sequence of views that show people waking up in hotel rooms or nondescript dwellings and moving out into largely deserted cities. As the fragmented narrative progresses, anonymous characters engage in similar sets of activities, which emphasizes a common state of being - an urge to get moving, to be everywhere - if also a degree of isolation. The configuration of the moment continues the themes of movement and unrest while providing a figurative parallel between human travels and the flow of images around and to us. The visitor to Aitken's installation navigates a dark, wide-open gallery space to view the work, prompting a state of wandering that recalls that of the film's subjects. Depending on where one stands, the visual relationship between the different screens changes, and each monitor has a mirror on its back, which expands the visual field dramatically and creates a kaleidoscopic flurry of imagery in certain viewing positions. At the same time, the channels are not static - the narrative threads do not play on set monitors but instead migrate across the eleven screens in different ways as the video progresses. For much of its duration, variations of similar scenes play across the screens simultaneously, enacted by different characters; occasionally, however, a single image aligns momentarily on all of them. Finally, the images are set into a frantic state of motion, jumping from one screen to the next in quick succession. The looped video builds to a rushing climax before starting over - the characters returning, if only temporarily, to a state of rest.

Over the course of half an hour, the camera slowly pans across the different groupings of women. Eventually it begins to zoom in on their faces and their bodies, both enacting and eliciting the viewer's lingering gaze. Beecroft 's work partakes in the voyeuristic dynamics of sexual consumerism with a degree of self-conscious complicity, but she also denaturalizes these patterns and invites the viewer's discomfort. Beecroft has said, "I like to display nudity to provoke the fear or embarrassment or the confusion of the audience."1 Poised between eroticism and cool, structured formalism, her living displays are suggestive but emotionally vacant, demonstrating an aloof yet potentially aggressive sexuality.

This cool, methodical process depersonalizes the seated woman, gradually obscuring her features. In the end, the sitter loses her individual identity, becoming instead an inert sculptural form vaguely reminiscent of a marble bust, which is accentuated by a white paper collar around the neck that effectively serves as its base. Meanwhile, the actions of the faceless pastry chef resemble the strokes of a brush or palette knife, evoking the act of painting. Notably, these allusions to classical art forms emerge through activities and mater- ials that traditionally carry feminine, household associations, which are underscored at the end of the video as the woman washes her utensils. In this regard, Dunning's work recalls feminist video art of the 1970s, which depicted homely activities with a sustained, concentrated focus, aiming to legitimize the place of the domestic in art. The nature of the interaction in Icing complicates this kind of practice, however, by suggesting that a fixation on supposed women's routines can be potentially restrictive or fetishizing - not unequivocally liberating.

She cradles and caresses a glass sphere while a haunting pop song plays. The figure recalls a fortune-teller with her proverbial crystal ball, but she also invites other interpretations that coexist uneasily: she can be seen as a bodhisattva - a spiritual guide who forgoes nirvana out of compassion for those who suffer - but she also resembles a model promoting a new product, gazing directly at the audience with her glass orb seductively in hand.

The eight-minute video is a closely framed view of a woman's face that challenges us to distinguish whether she is laughing or crying. The footage is presented in slow motion and without sound, heightening the confusion between these different emotions. In narrative cinema, close-ups conventionally elicit a feeling of intimacy with the characters, but Taylor- Wood's ambiguous depiction of the woman's silenced cries encourages varied responses - from conflicting senses of identification and alienation to different shades of emotional engagement and critical detachment.

Because Rapture was Iranian, born 1957 made prior to the events of September 11, 2001, and the renewed tensions between the United States and the Middle East, current viewers' reactions are informed by associations about Islam and Iran that would likely not have affected perceptions of the work at the time of its 1999 debut in a. focus exhibition at the Art Institute.

Rather, her work recognizes (projection); 13 mm. oop tjie compiex intellectual and religious forces shaping the identity of Muslim women Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 2007.40 throughout the world. Rapture is an installation of two synchronized black-and-white video sequences that are projected on opposite walls; large in scale, they evoke cinema screens. Working with hours of footage and a team of editors, the artist constructed two parallel narratives: on one side of the room, men populate an architectural environment; in the other sequence, women move within a natural one. The piece begins with images of a stone fortress and a hostile desert, respectively. The fortress dissolves into a shot of over one hundred men - uniformly dressed in plain white shirts and black pants - walking quickly through the cobblestone streets of an old city and entering the gates of the fortress. Simultaneously, the desert scene dissolves into a shot of an apparently 80</page><page sequence="72">equal number of women, wearing flowing, full-length veils, or chadors, emerging from different points in the barren landscape. As the video progresses, the men busy themselves with a variety of mundane, sometimes absurd activities that contradict the intended function of the space. On the other side of the installation, the women chant, pray, and later, having made their way across the desert, launch a boat into the sea with six of their own aboard. In Rapture, Neshat self-consciously exploits entrenched clichés about gender and space: namely, the equation of woman with irrational, wild nature and man with rational, ordered culture. The video installation is itself a study of gendered group dynamics, with the viewer literally positioned between two opposing worlds. The players in Neshat 's surreal, segregated narratives are deployed in a syncopated rhythm of action and nonaction, mutual recognition and nonrecognition, advance and retreat. Rapture ' exists as a poignant reflection on the rootless, unsettled psychology of exile. As an Iranian expatriate living in the United States, Neshat maintains a critical distance that has allowed her to locate both the poetics and the power of the veil. At the same time she celebrates the strength and beauty of Islamic women, she remains keenly aware of the horrors of repression.

The Long Road to Mazatlán begins Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 2007.41 with a composite image, reminiscent of CinemaScope, stretching across three screens that are placed side by side.2 This soon breaks apart to reveal divisions that operate either as separate parts of the same space, revealing multiple perspectives on a single setting or action, or as a composite image composed of misaligned parts. The artist has stated that the use of multiple screens allows him "to explore certain compositional ideas that are impossible with a single screen."3 The work's title refers to Tennessee Williams's play The Glass Menagerie (1944), in which a family recalls their abandonment by a father who later sends a postcard from Mazatlán, Mexico. Julien explains: "He was going to a place of no return. So Mazatlán is a mythic space."4 In responding to Williams, Julien conjures the poeticism of the American South. The artist created The Long Road to Mazatlán in collaboration with choreographer Javier De Frutos while he was in residence at ArtPace, San Antonio. In the film, two cowboys, played by De Frutos and Phillippe Riera, become entangled in an attraction that unfolds into a tale of lust, longing, and fantasy. Julien uses the settings, costumes, and props of a typical western, although the actions of his protagonists undermine the genre's hypermasculine stereotype. "I'm very interested in seducing audiences into scenarios or tableaux that they might not usually be drawn to or interested in."5 In this way, Julien's film is informed by - and responds to - the work of artists such as Andy Warhol, whose Lonesome Cowboys (1968) explores the sexual politics of the western in a similar fashion.6 82</page><page sequence="74">83 Alternately linear and layered, Julien's narrative shifts between representation and fantasy, showing the characters within a series of richly constructed tableaux inclu- ding a cattle auction, a saloon, and a swimming pool, their bodies moving in rhythmic relationship. Such vignettes often make reference to art history and popular culture. The surreal colors and interplay between characters in the pool sequence, for instance, seem to take their inspiration from David Hockney's richly colored pool paintings, which capture the relaxed, decadently sun-soaked aspect of gay culture in late- 1960s Los Angeles. The most explicit allusion is to Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver (1976), in which Robert DeNiro's character stands before a mirror imagining a confrontation in which he draws a gun and asks, "Are you talking to me?" Underscoring the impor- tance of the gaze, Julien reprises this moment in a motel room, with Riera asking his reflection, "Are you looking at me?" In the film's closing scenes, which are reminiscent of Stephan Elliot's Priscilla Queen of the Desert (1994), the men perform a jerky, deconstructed dance on opposite sides of a road. Three women dressed as showgirls appear in the center, pirouetting as they approach the camera. Julien elaborates: "For me the women symbolically represent a parting from the gender roles that ordinarily would be assigned to them. In the conventional moving-image culture, they would be dancing with the cowboys or be in a position of becoming a vessel for something else. Here they represent a stereotype or hyperbole."7 K.M.B.</page><page sequence="75">Hirsch Perlman American, born i960 TWO Affect Studios Hirsch Perlman, a formerly Chicago-based artist who has lived and worked in Los Angeles since the late 1990s, is known for simple, witty, and self -reflexive photographs and videos. Intensely studio-driven, his work is often created in the spirit of isolated, Two color videos, sound (projection); homespun, nineteenth-century experiments and accidental discoveries. Indeed, in his 15 min. loop art, Perlman cultivates the aura and mystery of a mad scientist. Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 200742 Built uPon a narrow conceptual framework, his project revolves around a delib- erately limited set of spatial and material choices. One series, for instance, offers a daily chronicle of his three-year-plus retreat into his studio, where he created art only from small incidents and with packing supplies and readily available, found materials. Perlman has called these tragicomic works "low-tech allegories of process . . . stories about what artists do."1 Ultimately, his charmingly modest pieces reveal themselves as highly sophisticated, self-knowing, and intelligent commentaries on the obsessive aspects of art making. The results speak to the constraints and the freedoms such impulses bring. Two Affect Studies consists of characteristically simple experiments. In the first sequence, a tape measure marks a spot on the wall while the camera documents the mad, free forms of a rubber band repeatedly snapped into the air. The image is improbably set, to near-comic effect, against "Functional" (1957), a tune by jazz legend Thelonious Monk. In the second part of the work, Perlman recorded the visual effects produced by the billowing wisps of smoke from two cigarettes left smoldering in an ashtray. Accompanied by Samuel Barber's willfully sentimental "Adagio for Strings" (1936), this sequence, like its counterpart, uncovers the surprising potential for emotion, humor - and, ultimately, meaning - that resides within the simplest of stunts.

She incorporates both art history and personal exploration, investigating the ways in which contemporary Color video, sound (projection); 936 min. loop definitions of aesthetics and art making are connected to issues of gendenidentity and Gift of Donna and Howard Stone, 2007.43 sexuality. Inspired by the feminist artists of the 1970s, she reframes and subverts art- historical and societal conventions surrounding women and beauty. Antoni creates intimate, ritualized encounters between her chosen materials and her own body, which has become her essential tool. In Touch, which was commissioned for SITE Santa Fe in 2002, she balances on a tightrope, a skill she has sought to master. Here, on the beach in front of her childhood home on Grand Bahama Island, the artist walks a line that is parallel to the horizon. Dressed in sky blue, she enters the landscape from outside the frame. When the wire dips under her weight, it appears to touch the horizon, creating the illusion that she is walking on the water. Like many of Antoni's works, Touch records a relationship - a moment of contact - and reveals the artist's longing to bridge the gaps between herself and viewers, between her work and art history.1 Antoni begins with an idea of artistic process that dictates the final result and meaning. The idea of Touch derives from Moor (2001), a work in whjch the artist created a rope out of her and her friends' belongings; the artist has said that while she intends to walk it, she also questions the impulse.2 Touch depicts a literal balancing act in order to suggest the state of perfection that many people strive for, including herself. Antoni has said, "Touch is about that moment or that desire to walk on the horizon," a location that represents hope and the future.3 She explained that she wants to walk in "this impossible place, a place that cannot be pinpointed ... on the line of my vision, or along the edge of my imagination."4 Since the viewer's involvement is a crucial element in her work, Antoni asks us to imagine ourselves in her situation and contemplate the meaning of the horizon when she is absent from the scene. As the artist teeters but never falls, she accepts and almost embraces a state of imbalance.

He grew up under one of the most repressive communist dictatorships in Europe and later witnessed the Mixed BehCtVlOUr tentative transition to a democratic, market-driven system before leaving to study in 2003 France in 1 996.

Blindfold, like Sala's work in general, displays an acute political consciousness. The two-channel projection (at top) depicts a blinding sun. Shown both at sunrise and sunset, it reflects off a pair of new, as-yet-unused metal billboards in Tirana, a city that figures prominently in many of Sala's mature experiments. The radiant blankness of the two boards, which appear as surrogate cinema screens, suggests, the incipient, fragile nature of Albania's transition to a capitalist economy. The infrastructure of shiny public advertising coexists incongruously with the city's decrepit surroundings. Mixed Behaviour (at bottom) embodies the most important themes and strategies of this artist's oeuvre, including strikingly innovative play between foreground and background, light and dark, sound and picture.1 Here, a lone disc jockey filmed squarely from behind spins records on a Tirana rooftop. It is a rainy New Year's Eve, and the man bends to his task covered by a plastic tarp while fireworks explode all around him, briefly illuminating the darkness; their clamor overlaps with the sound of gunfire, a local holiday tradition. Gradually, we realize that the video's soundtrack plays in manipulated synchrony with the fireworks: like the Wizard of Oz under a clear plastic veil, the DJ appears to control a scene that stretches across the background like a movie screen or canvas. However, while the music proceeds in a predictable, linear fashion, seeming to conjure the fireworks in the distance, we realize that the images are periodically moving backward; almost undetectably, the fireworks are reversing, seeming to implode. This action suggests the practice of "scratching" - rapidly and repeatedly reversing the direction of a record on a turntable. As Mixed Behaviour shows us, Sala exploits the medium of digital video so comfortably and completely that his arrangement of digital image and accompanying sound offers an astonishingly new use of filmic art.

Her texts have appeared on benches, billboards, Internet sites, posters, sarcophagi, in the form of monumental Xenon projections, and, most commonly, as LED (light-emitting diode) signs. Blue Tilt features texts from five of Holzer 's iconic series: Truisms :; Inflammatory Essays (1979-82), one hundred words in twenty lines inspired by the literature of Emma Goldman, Rosa Luxembourg, Lenin, Mao, and others, also printed on posters; Living (1980-82), matter-of-fact writings on "everyday life with a twist" that were originally shown on cast-bronze plaques and hand-lettered metal signs; the urgent Survival (1983-85), which appeared on the Spectacolor board in New York's Times Square and was the first series the artist conceived for electronic signs; and the desperate Under A Rock (1986), which was engraved on stone benches shortly after Holzer's move to the countryside of upstate New York.1 Although all of these texts are the artist's invention, they do not necessarily reflect her personal views. Indeed, they employ a variety of contradictory voices, assuming a tone of anonymous authority in order to express a wide spectrum of biases and beliefs in which truth is relative. Blue Tilt captures each of these signature moments in the medium most readily associated with Hölzer - the LED. The structure of Blue Tilt's installation is architectural and dramatic, with imposing sixteen-foot, double-sided signs towering over viewers and bathing the entire space in the light of a relentless stream of words. "One reason I've stayed with LEDs so long," remarked Hölzer, "is that part of the experience is that the light and words hit the body. This might give you vertigo; it might represent that there's always too much information and 'how do I process it?' It could make you unsure of the floor; I try to use reflections to that end."2 Under her control, the gallery becomes a stage that at once creates and serves an audience that can no longer make itself comfortable.

The two looped channels are shown simultaneously, UnCXplodcd one depicting slow-motion dissolves of distant falling figures in gray-blue sky, the 2QQJ other showing scenes of the open ocean and the natural light of the beach.

Gravesend and Unexploded, when considered together, present a narrative of low-tech mining in the Congo, high-tech industrial production in England, and the complex traumas of the war in Iraq. Originally shot on 35 mm film and transferred to high-definition digital format, Gravesend (opposite, at top and middle) enjoys significantly increased production values that allow each sequence to unfold in exquisite detail. The film alternates between images of a sterile British laboratory for the processing of columbite-tantalite, or coltan - a highly valuable metallic ore used in computer and communications technologies - and the dirty, arduous labor of extracting the mineral with rudimentary pickaxes, shovels, and the weathered hands of Congolese miners. The narrative is bisected by a silent series of still time- lapse shots that show the sun slowly setting over the silhouetted smokestacks of the factories in the industrial port town of Graveseïid, to which the title refers.4 While they are two discrete works, Gravesend and Unexploded .are meant to be seen in succession in one gallery space separated by a dividing wall. Only fifty- four seconds long and silent, Unexploded (at bottom) is encountered first, and is periodically affected by intense bursts of sound that spill over from the adjacent space. In Gravesend, the artist clearly departs from the rough, handheld aesthetic that defines earlier work such as Exodus and Girls, Tricky. He returns to it again in Unexploded, which has the timeless quality of found footage but was shot by McQueen in Basra, Iraq, and shows the damage to a building wrought by an unexploded bomb.

Starrels; Burt Kaplan Fund; through prior gift Questions, which combines profound metaphysical speculations and banal of Gould, Inc., and the Los Angeles Museum tribulations, exemplifies the willful ambiguity that pervades the artists' oeuvre. A of Contemporary Art, purchased with funds large-scale, choreographed installation, the work utilizes fifteen slide projectors to provided by Acquisition and Collection cast hundreds of handwritten queries written in four different languages - English, Committee, 2008.208 German, Italian, and Japanese - in white on the walls of a dark room. The words, never ceasing to ask while proposing no answers, overlap each other, creating undulating patterns that slowly appear and quickly fade. The interrogations range from the empirical ("How long is the Nile?") to the absurd ("Is it true that traces of aliens have been found in yogurt?"), the personal ("Am I loved?"), and the metaphysical ("Do souls wander?"). "Our aim wasn't to think about the questions themselves too much," the artists explained, "but about someone coming up with all those questions. In very vague terms, we did imagine someone asking himself slightly paranoid questions that revolve very much around himself."1 These, they think, are just the sort of questions that would run through his mind as he falls asleep, hence the dark room. Questions have preoccupied Fischii &amp; Weiss for over twenty-five years, first appearing in the photocopied publication Order and Cleanliness (198 1), which accompanied the film The Least Resistance (1980-8 1). In that work, the artists, dressed in plush rat and bear costumes, ponder the limits of existence. They explored this terrain further in the book Big Questions/ Small Questions, in which they juxtapose expansive questions such as "Where is the galaxy going?" with smaller ones like "Has the last bus gone?" The pair revisited these interrogations in 1984, when they lined the interior of Question Pot, a large polyurethane vessel, with one hundred questions in German. They first projected their queries in 2000 with three slide projectors, following this with a five-projector version and expanding it yet again with Questions, the large-scale work shown here. Along with a companion book, Will Happiness Find Me?, thèj.piece debuted at the 2003 Venice Biennale, where it won the Golden Lion; soon thereafter, it entered the Art Institute's collection as a joint acquisition with the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. Within its dreamlike atmosphere, Questions highlights the force of language, illu- minating the concerns that haunt our psyches. Grand in scale and powerfully poignant, it evokes and transcends nearly every other work the artists have produced.

Rich in art- historical and conceptual references, her typically pared-down settings blend the 16mm color film, silent; 134 min. loop surreal and uncanny with prosaic depictions of everyday rituals, subverting normal Claire and Gordon Prussian Fund for expectations-for example, a little girl's bedroom is inhabited by an elderly woman, Contemporary Art 2008 482 Edvard Munch's 1902 woodcut The Kiss is restaged in a techno club, and a corporate office becomes the setting for a modern-day Madonna and Child. Amazon - arguably the artist's most powerful film to date - depicts an androgynous archer repeatedly raising and drawing a bow, which casts sharp shadows across the figure's chest. Close-up views of neck, shoulder, and upper arm muscles snapping between tension and rest are visually dissected by short sequences and rapid changes in camera angle. As Andrea Schlieker observed, "Dolven has used the transformative power of the body fragment to great effect" in her films.1 The choice of 16mm film and the small scale of the projected image add to the; sense of intimacy conveyed by the close-up camera work. The artist has stated, "The way I use the frame in video is similar to the way I would use the four sides of a painting. I am interested in what we 'see' in the work, in how you touch the edge, but also how it touches upon an 'unseen' element, an element of the imagination, which exists outside the frame."2 Vacillating between close-ups and mid-shots, the camera never reveals the identity of the protagonist, allowing the imagination to fill in the blanks. Dolven deftly conveys a lifetime of experience in a fleeting one and a half minutes; the film is looped in such a way as to allow repeated viewings, each one divulging new information without ever telling the whole story. The piece ends with a quick mid- shot of the archer's bare torso, exposing a missing breast. Referring to the mythic race of female warriors who were said to cut off their» right breasts to facilitate the drawing of the bow and increase the accuracy of their arrows, the title conveys the harnessed strength, courage, and physical determination required to overcome breast cancer and the other corporeal obstacles women may face.

Eschewing the labels of photographer and filmmaker, Lassry adopts the conceptual conceit of an Super 16mm color film, silent; 5:21 min. loop artist using a camera; he is inspired by picture making in the tradition of practitioners va/i 1 ki j r j ^ a , such as J Tack Goldstein, ' whose films, ' which resemble "movine &amp;r photographs," &amp; r ' reject ' va/i Wilson 1 L Mead ki j r Fund; j ^ Contemporary Art a , J ' ' &amp;r &amp; r ' ' Discretionary and The Orbit funds, 2008.660 narrative altogether.1 Based in Los Angeles, Lassry creates elegant and economical compositions that take advantage of professional actors, animal trainers, and camera crews - works that at once draw upon and slyly critique the structures and institutions of Hollywood and the art world. U fit it led CA¿On) Zebra and Woman (at top) is a single-shot Super 16mm film that opens with an 20Q-7 image of a wagging tail against a black background, suggesting the flickering of a motion picture.2 As the camera pans over a zebra's hide, the animal's breath causes a Super 16mm color film, silent; 13:27 min. loop visual vibration.The black-and-white pattern, which eventually fills the entire screen, Wilson L. Mead Fund; Contemporary Art evokes the Op Art paintings of Bridget Riley as well as the compositional experiments Discretionary and The Orbit funds, 2008.659 of Morris Louis, referencing in particular Alpha-Pi (i960), a work from his Unfurled series in which multicolored paint rivulets seemingly enter from outside the picture and flow diagonally toward the empty white center of an unprimed canvas. In a similar treatment, Lassry 's camera passes over the zebra's body and head, moving through an empty blackness to reveal a close-up of a beautiful blonde woman portrayed by actress Radha Mitchell.3 In this way, the artist transforms his literal subjects - the zebra and the woman - into a means of presenting a space that is both cinematic and painterly. As in the work of William Wegman (see p. 22) and Diana Thater (see pp. 56-57), human and animal relationships figure prominently in Lassry's oeuvre. Here, he addresses the psychological void between his subjects, which he represents by the pan through darkness, and also explores their respective experiences of portraiture. Untitled (Agon) (at bottom) features dancers Megan LeCrone and Ask La Cour of the New York City Ballet performing the last sequence of George Balanchine's Agon (1957). Lassry's silent film further abstracts Balanchine's decidedly modernist choreography by removing Igor Stravinsky's accompanying musical score. The film begins with a close-up of LeCrone's face as she internally rehearses the steps she is about to perform on the floor; her subtly shifting eyes and head allude to the body movements to come. Once the couple has completed the pas de deux, the camera hones in on La Cour's face, and the film comes full circle as he mentally reviews his routine. Using a predetermined visual approach that nods to the work of structural filmmakers such as Michael Snow (see pp. 14-15), Lassry positions his camera according to an instructional diagram from dancer and choreographer Doris Humphrey's groundbreaking book The Art of Making Dances (1959). As in Zebra and Woman, and many of his other works, the artist explores the function and parameters of portraiture - in this instance, not only of the dancers, but of the dance itself.
