<plain_text><page sequence="1">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God Kai Nielsen I It is plausible to argue, and it has been repeatedly argued, that in order for us to understand what we are saying when we speak of God, it must be possible to state what-at least in principle-would, or at any rate, could, count for or against the truth of the statement that something is transcendent to the world and completely independent of the world. In specifying what would count for or against such cosmological remarks, it is crucial that we specify some unequivocally empirical states of affairs, for if we do not, the putative states of affairs appealed to will have a similar problematic status and we shall still have our initial difficulties in understanding. It will not, that is to say, help to say that we know what it would be like to disconfirm (say) "God loves man- kind," namely, that it can be noted whether God hates mankind, for if we have trouble understanding what we are talking about when we are talking about God loving mankind, we are going to have as much trouble understanding "God hates mankind." Such religious claims need an empirical anchorage: we need to know what purely empirical states of affairs count for or against their truth so that we can distinguish the conditions under which we would be justified in asserting that there is an infinite savior transcendent to the world and the conditions under which we would not be justified in making such a putative assertion. But, as the disputes over the theology and falsification issue bring out, this is precisely what we cannot do. We seem at least to be at a loss to understand what it is we are asserting or denying when we use such nonanthropomorphic God-talk. Here we are on well-traveled ground, but there are, however, three responses which it is natural to make to such a claim which do deserve consideration and which do lead us on to new ground. I shall label them " the naive empiricist move," " the Quinean move," and " the inter- pretive move," and I shall consider them in that order. Any of these '99</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion moves, if sound, would help us in an important way to make sense of the alleged truth claims of religion, and they would support a kind of empiricism in religion. I shall begin with the "naive empiricist move." A rather commonsensical philosopher-a kind of naive empiricist- recalling the refinements of the theology and falsification debate might argue in this manner. Suppose certain very extraordinary events sud- denly and inexplicably began occurring in great numbers; for example, suppose all over North America it turned out that sick people get well whenever they sincerely with their whole heart and mind ask God for help. Suppose further that this happens even when they have diseases that doctors believe are quite incurable. Those who have faith, that is, those who can really bring themselves to believe in God, and who ask God for help in this manner get well; those who are without unwavering faith do not. No known medical account of how they could have gotten well exists. There is not, let us suppose, even a plausible psychosomatic account. Further suppose that no naturalistic explanation is found for their getting well when they pray, and yet these happenings go on regularly for several generations. If these extraordinary but quite empirically describable events were to take place, would it not then become reasonable to assert that there is a God or that there probably is a God who answers the prayers of those who truly beseech him ? More generally, if there were areas in our experience which did not in fact admit of naturalistic explanation, would this not go some way to con- firm theistic beliefs and disconfirm or at least weaken naturalistic ones ? Would a man not be a pretty poor empiricist who did not at- tend to and modify his beliefs in a theistic direction on the basis of such experiences ? I may be a pretty poor empiricist, but I do not think such events, if they were to transpire, would count for a nonanthropomorphic God- assertion. I do not think it would establish such theistic beliefs or even give them an empirical anchorage. The naturalist in such a fantastic circumstance could readily admit, and should indeed readily admit, that these are extraordinary events of a thoroughly baffling kind. At present he has no explanation for them at all. Maybe he never will have, but, it seems to me, he would be right in asserting that he sees no reason for saying that in principle there can be no naturalistic explana- tion of such events. There may indeed be events for which we have no naturalistic explanation, and there is no compelling reason to believe that at any given time or perhaps even ever there will be a naturalistic 200</page><page sequence="3">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God explanation for everything.' A naturalist or atheist should assent to that. However, there is another claim, frequently confused with it, which he most certainly should question. That claim is this: "There is some turn of events, for which, for some principled or theoretical reason, no naturalistic explanation can, logically can, be found." His questioning here should be of a distinctive sort. It should not be a matter of assessing the grounds for believing that such a putative statement is true, for no clear sense has been given to such a word string. Given the above bizarre experiences, the naturalist could most properly reply: "I do not have an explanation for them and perhaps I never will, but I do not see how they can be said' to point out of experience toward a Being transcendent to the cosmos,' for 'point out of experience' has no use in the language and 'a Being transcendent to the cosmos' is said to be a referring expression and yet we have not been told what would or could count as its referent. We have no idea how to identify such a supposed referent or what would count for or against there being such a referent." Thus, such an objection does not touch the kind of difficulties that have been raised about the intelligibility of God-talk. II Still working within what broadly may be characterized as an empiricist framework-after all, there are empiricists and empiricists-there is another counterargument with a Quinean flavor to be considered.2 On the very same grounds as the grounds I have used to criticize Crombie, I would have to say-so the argument runs-" There are electrons" or "Photons exist" are either unintelligible or without factual significance. But such a claim is surely absurd. In short, there are theoretical terms in science that do not admit of complete elucida- tion in terms of what Carnap and Hempel call an "empiricist lan- guage." One cannot indicate or point to what these theoretical terms stand for. Unless I wish to be thoroughly absurd, I must certainly allow that it is not meaningless to talk about photons, but if I allow such talk, then 201 1 Arthur Danto has forcefully pointed this out in his "Faith, Language, and Religious Experience: A Dialogue," in Religious Experience and Truth, ed. Sidney Hook (New York: New York University Press, I96I), pp. 137-49. 2 During a discussion of my views on theology and falsification before the New York University graduate philosophy colloquium, Sidney Morgenbesser and Raziel Abelson took this Quinean approach.</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion should I not in consistency also admit that "There is a God" or "God exists " has factual content ? Moreover, it is unrealistic and unreasonable to examine statements like "There are electrons " or "All men have an oedipus complex" in isolation. We must not forget Quine's reminder " that our statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually but only as a corporate body." 3 Such an argument would have it that it is also true that to understand such statements we must see how they function within the body of a theory. It makes no sense to try to confirm them or infirm them in isolation. They are only so testable when they are examined as part of a whole conceptual system. The same conditions, they argue, apply to religious utterances. We should not, as both Crombie and I have done, examine religious statements in isolation, but only either in the body of a whole theory- as in some theological system-or, more plausibly, I should think, as part of the whole activity of some given religion. Furthermore, we cannot directly confirm or disconfirm high level theological or religious statements such as " There is a God" or " God created the heavens and the earth" or "'God loves man." Apparent disconfirming evidence can always be plausibly met by adding or altering various subsidiary hypotheses or subsidiary theological statements. We can always make an adjustment somewhere in the system. But exactly the same thing is true of any theoretical principle in science. In both religion and science if enough of these subsidiary claims fail or are thought to fail, the whole system or the whole religion is given up (people do lose their faith), but it is never a matter of disconfirming or infirming key religious statements taken in isolation. Such statements, as their analogues in science, are relatively immune to confirmation or dis- confirmation. But it is still not the case that within the system there is nothing that counts as an empirical check of religious claims. Certain high-level statements can in no way be directly confirmed or dis- confirmed, but other statements within the system can, so that it is not the case that religious language is devoid of an empirical anchorage. But fundamentally it is the system as a whole that is up for test. There are several issues that need to be untangled here. I shall consider the easier ones first. There can be no logical ban on directly confirming or disconfirming (infirming) high-level religious or scientific statements, if they can be indirectly confirmed or infirmed. Quine does 202 3 Willard Van Orman Quine, From a Logical Point of View (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1953), P. 41.</page><page sequence="5">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God not question that such statements can be indirectly confirmed or disconfirmed when taken as part of a system of statements. But the above Quinean argument does nothing to show that it is logically possible directly to confirm or disconfirm key central segments of such God-talk. If my arguments in my Contemporary Critiques of Religion and in my Scepticism about theology and falsification and about fixing the reference range of" God" have been near to their mark, it is logically impossible directly to confirm or infirm such central segments of nonanthropo- morphic God-talk. But then it is also impossible indirectly to confirm or infirm them, for " indirectly " could only qualify " confirm " or "infirm," if it had an intelligible opposite. But if it is logically impossible "directly to confirm or infirm them," then "indirectly confirm or infirm " is deprived of its putative intelligible opposite. What should be said in reply to such an argument is that it was a mistake to introduce the terminology of" direct" and " indirect" here. Rather, what the Quinean should have said is that what counts as confirmation or disconfirmation in such a context is the testimony of lower-level statements as statements in a religious system. This is what counts as a test here, and this is what establishes the empirical anchorage for religious claims. Remember, it is the whole religious system that is being tested and not individual religious statements. There is no step-by- step testing of individual statements. This is certainly a plausible remark to make. However, it makes several quite questionable assumptions, and it is these that need critical inspection. Part of the difficulty with this Quinean move is involved in the phrase "system" and the analogy between science and religion or science and theology. Usually people who make these Quinean claims are philosophers who work in the philosophy of science, and their paradigms for "system" come from mathematics and science (usually physics). But religions and even theologies are hardly-at least in that sense-systems. They are not neat or even unneat hypotheticodeductive- predictive systems. Rather, religions are activities, essentially social activities as Durkheim stressed, with rites and loosely related doctrinal claims. The doctrinal formulae of religion indeed fit together, and they are not unconnected with the ritual of the religion in question. But these different types of religious sentence are not in tightly related inferential patterns. One can accept some parts and still reject other parts. And there is no clear sense of what is " the whole of the system." In fact, there is no unproblematic use of "system" here. Christianity and Judaism do not have axioms, theorems, or rules of formation and 20o3</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion transformation. We must not forget that religion is an activity and not a theory-and that theology, particularly natural theology, though it claims to be a science, is not, to put it conservatively, a discipline with an unproblematical scientific status. Moreover, it is risky to treat "God" as having the same logical status as the theoretical terms of science. " God," unlike "neutrino," is not a theoretical term or a theoretical construct. It has a very different use in the language. "God" presumably refers to an infinite, nonspatiotemporal individual who is transcendent to the universe. A Jew or Christian cannot view his God simply as a heuristic device to use in facing the problems of life or in achieving social solidarity and selflessness; in fine, he cannot regard his religion merely as the conceptual framework he adopts. Rather, he must believe that "God" actually denotes what he takes to be "an ultimate reality" whose existence cannot depend on human conventions. Perhaps the believer is wrong. Perhaps there is no such reality, but in believing in God it is this that he takes as the object of his religious faith. By contrast, a theoretical construct is something for which no question can (logically) arise about whether the theoretical term, which is its sign-vehicle, stands for a reality either in or "out of" the world. Where such questions are in order we cannot be speaking of something which is merely a theoretical construct. But such questions are in order vis-a-vis "God." It is not self-contradictory or even a deviation from a linguistic regularity to ask whether there is really a God. Similarly, whereas in the case of " electron" there is reason to believe that what is being talked about is part of the furniture of the universe, these realities cannot be treated as being simply theoretical constructs, and the logical possibility of such realities being observed cannot be ruled out. But, where "God" is used nonanthropomor- phically, that is, in a non-Zeus-like way, it is logically impossible to observe or perceive God.4 It is not a matter of finding out how " God " functions in the theory, for religion is not a theory but a complex, loosely knit activity. Discus- sions of what I have called " Wittgensteinian Fideism " have brought out how without a participant's understanding of that activity, there can be little understanding of " God." Yet even with it the concept of God can still remain problematical. These various differences destroy 204 4 See here Father F. C. Copleston's remarks in his reviews of Richard Robinson's An Atheist's Values, and Axel Hiigerstr6m's Philosophy and Religion in the Heythrop Journal 5 (1964): 402-9, and 7 (1966): 76-79, respectively.</page><page sequence="7">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God the point of the analogy between science and religion or science and theology. Someone might resist and maintain that God after all is not so very unlike a theoretical entity such as a neutrino. Many Jews remain thoroughly skeptical and yet are wedded to Judaism. For them, as for certain Christians, God is a "construct of the human heart." In that way God indeed is not a theoretical construct. But the crucial thing to see is that we are still talking about a construct-something which from a logical point of view still remains for them a heuristic device to drama- tize their conception of the Highest, of that which is most exalted and most worthy of devotion. As radical theology in effect attests, there are indeed those within the Jewish tradition and even within the Christian tradition who would make such claims. We are reminded of Feuerbach's remark that what today is atheism tomorrow is religion. But my point quite simply is that this is indeed radical theology and such a shift is a radical shift in religious stance, for it is, as Santayana clearly recognized, a naturalistic and indeed an atheistical reconstruction of religion and not an attempt to perspiciously display-to interpret-the actual use of " God" in the mainstream or even near-mainstream Jewish and Christian tradition. Santayana playfully called himself "a Catholic atheist," but in spite of the fact that he deliberately immersed himself in the stream of Catholic religious life, he never took the sacraments. He neither literally thought of himself as a Catholic nor did Catholics regard him as a Catholic. Think of what a Jew or Christian could say and still remain a Jew or Christian. Consider: "No question of the reality of God can arise for God is not a reality transcendent to the world but simply, though profoundly, a moral myth we tell ourselves to make sense out of an otherwise senseless existence." This may be a profound remark, but it is not a remark that a knight of faith could possibly make. " God " is not used in Jewish or Christian discourses either as a label for a theo- retical construct or a " construct of the human heart." God in Jewish or Christian religious discourses is not taken to be a fictitious or mythical being. A believer may indeed maintain that our images or concepts of God are myth ridden, but he cannot say that in believing in God we are believing in a myth. His skepticism must always be qualified. To save something of religion or even to save what a secularist might take to be "the heart of religion," one might, through suitable stipula- tions, come to use "God" in a new way such that it is now taken to be 205</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion simply a symbol for our ultimate concerns.5 We could reconstruct the Jewish and Christian religions in this way. But this is to do something entirely different from what the Christian or Jewish theologian or philosopher set out to do, for now we are no longer even trying to elucidate "God," but we are recommending a new use for "God" that would radically alter the use it actually has and make Judaism and Christianity into someting very different from what Jews and Christians take it to be. Some might feel that vis-a-vis the Quinean move, I have not gone to the heart of the matter. What I have ignored is the Quinean claim that statements cannot be confirmed or infirmed in isolation but that our statements about what there is face the tribunal of' sense experience not individually but as a corporate body. It is only when, after repeated examination, a number of claims fail that a whole religion is given up. The last part of this claim is surely correct. The problem of evil beautifully illustrates it. If one has good reasons for believing in the God of the Jews, Christians, and Moslems, one can meet Humean objections about evil. But, given the weakening of faith on other grounds, the Humean challenge about evil becomes powerful. There is, however, reason to be skeptical about the claim that statements must face the tribunal of sense experience as a corporate body rather than individually. Here, such Quineans may well be caught up in " the myth of the whole." 6 Why in such a loosely organized activity as religion must it be the whole system that is tested ? Even a Christian might have his doubts about the Trinity, original sin, or the virgin birth and still believe that there is good evidence or good grounds for believing in a creator of the heavens and the earth and for many other crucial elements of Christian doctrine. And for many former Jews or Christians who have become skeptics, it is the very centrally placed religious claims of Christianity that cause the trouble rather than peripheral claims or claims near the experiential periphery. That is to say, if the skeptic could accept or make sense of the central ones, he could accept the peripheral ones without any difficulty. If he could believe in God, he could believe that he ought to hold the Sabbath sacred or that Jesus inexplicably cured the sick. It is the central religious doctrines that he 206 5 I have examined this problem in my "Is God So Powerful That He Doesn't Even Have to Exist ?" Religious Experience and Truth, ed. Sidney Hook (New York: New York University Press, 1961), pp. 270-81. 6 I take the title from Albert Hofstadter's " The Myth of the Whole: A Considera- tion of Quine's View of Knowledge," Journal of Philosophy 51 (July 1954): 397-417.</page><page sequence="9">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God needs some evidence for or at least needs to know what it would be like to have evidence for them. If there were such evidence, he could readily enough accept many of the peripheral beliefs. If, to paraphrase James Joyce, he could accept those absurdities, he could accept many other absurdities less central to the framework. One can believe that Jesus was a deep spiritual leader, that he was born in Nazareth, and that he preached brotherly love and cured people in a mysterious way and still find the claim that "Jesus is God incarnate" utterly incoherent. Religion-and even Christianity-is not such a seamless web as this Quinean approach would give us to understand. There are no sound reasons for accepting the claim that only, or even typically, whole systems are confirmed or infirmed. It may be that we can only under- stand such utterances in context, as part of a language game, but in that language game individual statements are up for test in isolation or relative isolation and some seem to be utterly untestable and make no coherent links with those that are testable. A kind of Hegelianism which would deny this is suspect even when it comes from a distinguished logician. At least we have been given no adequate reason for accepting it. III So those philosophers of religion-such as Crombie, Hick, and Wilson- who would be empiricists in religion stick, and rightly so, to questions concerning the confirmation of certain key religious claims.7 Their problem is, how are we to make sense of them by showing that they are at least in principle confirmable or infirmable. Jews, Christians, and Moslems believe their key theological and religious claims to be factual, but they are perplexed, as I am perplexed and as Flew is, about the logical status of such God-talk. Given the fact that naturalistic accounts and theistic accounts seem equally compatible with all experiences actual and conceivable, it is far from evident how there could be any other than a purely terminological difference between the man who asserts and the man who denies the existence of God. Their difference appears to be quite comparable to the difference between the man who asserts "Jane sweats" and the man who replies, "No Jane doesn't sweat, she only glows." Thus, empiricists in religion try, and to my mind quite properly, to specify certain experiencable states which, if 207 7 I have given my reasons for rejecting Crombie's analysis (" On Fixing the Reference Range of 'God,"' Religious Studies 2, no. I [1966]: 13-36). My criticisms of Hick and Wilson occur in "Eschatological Verification," Canadian Journal of Theology 9, no. 4 (1963): 271-81; and "Christian Positivism and the Appeal to Religious Experience," Journal of Religion 42 (October 1962): 248-61.</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion they were actually to transpire, would count for theism and against atheism. Crombie and Hick's doctrine of eschatological verification was developed in order to show how theists do not simply differ in verbal-picture preference from atheists, but differ substantively over a matter of fact, for example, over the existence of and nature of God, where affirmations and denials of Divine Existence make some difference in experience in the hereafter. The naturalist says something that is mundane and down to earth. The theist wants to say something about an ultimate mystery such that what he says in some intelligible sense goes beyond what the naturalist can say. But given the above state of affairs, it looks as if the theist succeeds only in using a different and more perplexing notation. My tactic with such empiricists in religion has been simply to track down their varied and often subtle claims to have described a conceivable experienceable turn of events which would count for the truth of theism and against atheism. If my arguments have been correct, they have not succeeded in doing that; they have not succeeded in showing that "There is a God" and "There is no God" or "God loves all mankind" and "God is indifferent to the affairs of men" and the like are not equally compatible with any and every conceivable experienceable turn of events that might, logically might, transpire. This shows, given the theory of factual intelligibility we both share, that their key religious claims cannot have the kind of intelligibility and logical status they claim for them. We differ in our choice of picture preferences and we differ in our attitudes, but not about what there is. Given this state of affairs, the nonbeliever can quite properly claim: (I) that the believer does not succeed in asserting anything more when he speaks of God than the nonbeliever does when he talks in purely secular terms; and (2) that there is good reason to reject the believer's picture preference and accept the nonbeliever's picture preference because the believer's is more mystifying and obscurantist than the nonbeliever's. The believer wants to say something more but fails to say anything coherent which conveys any information about what there is that is not already conveyed in the nonbeliever's remarks. IV It might be responded that even if all my objections against empiricists and cognitivists in religion are sound, I have only given good evidence for the claim that there is no possible decision procedure for these theistic claims: there is no possible way of deciding which are true or 208</page><page sequence="11">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God probably true. But I have not shown that the believer's statements are meaningless. To this my reply is that I have not said or implied that they were meaningless; indeed I have stressed that they are meaningful.8 I have only shown-given nonanthropomorphic uses of God-talk, talk involving what is thought to be a Transcendent reference-that they are factually meaningless or, if you prefer to put it that way, devoid of factual content or factual significance. They simply do not come off as factual statements. Indeed, I would maintain that they are pseudo- factual ideological statements, and have the kind of meaning and illocutionary and perlocutionary force appropriate to ideological statements. If there can be no conceivable tests that would, either directly or indirectly, singly or in conjunction with other statements, give us empirical grounds for asserting the theistic claims and retracting the nontheistic ones or retracting the theistic claims and asserting the nontheistic ones, then these claims are without factual content, that is, they do not succeed in making factual claims or claims about what there is. At this point two things might quite naturally be said. (I) It might be argued that I am still too much of a verificationist and that I am too rigid in my classification of types of statement. There are, it will be maintained, factual statements that are in no way confirmable or disconfirmable (infirmable) even in principle. I treat "empirical fact" as if it were a pleonasm, but it most certainly is not. There are empirical facts and nonempirical facts. Here I must confess that I am, with regard to factual statements, an unrepentant verificationist, and I do believe that in an important sense "empirical fact" is a redundancy. I shall simply throw out this challenge: can we give a case of a statement whose factual status is accepted by all parties as quite unproblematic which is not at least confirmable or disconfirmable in principle? I do not think we can. And if we cannot, does this not at least give some prima facie plausibility to the contention that a statement to be factual must be confirmable or disconfirmable in principle? V There is a rather different tack that might be taken here. One might give up the claim that theists and nontheists are making rival factual 209 8 See my Contemporary Critiques of Religion (London: Macmillan Co., i97i) and my Scepticism (London: Macmillan Co., 1973).</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion assertions and one might assert instead, as Basil Mitchell does, at the end of his review of Religious Experience and Truth, that theism " in its cognitive aspect, should be regarded as a conceptual scheme which offers, like any metaphysic, a systematic interpretation of human experience and must be judged by criteria of consistency, coherence and capacity to illuminate." 9 This interesting apercu of Mitchell's, which is an expression of what I have called the " interpretative move," very much needs elucidation, systematic development, and defense. Yet there are difficulties in any such view that need careful attention.10 If we follow Mitchell, Judeo-Christian belief at least appears to become something very different from what traditional believers have taken it to be. It can no longer be the case that believers are asserting a 210 9 Basil Mitchell, Review of Religious Experience and Truth, ed. Sidney Hook, in Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 15, no. 58 (1963). It could be and indeed has been objected that in criticizing what I have called "the interpretive move" in the way I have, I have, in so dismissing metaphysics, not taken the full measure of the opposition. An account of metaphysics such as W. H. Walsh's essentially treats metaphysics as an interpretative art and in arguing, as I do, I have ignored his elaborate defense of metaphysics. There are, it is pointed out, different ways of doing metaphysics and different conceptions of metaphysics. Not all metaphysics involves "a project to penetrate beyond what can be known by empirical methods to its alleged super- sensible substrate" (W. H. Walsh, "True and False in Metaphysics," in Knowledge and Value, ed. Elmer Sprague and Paul Taylor [New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1967], p. 199). Such a criticism is, however, off the mark, for I have not tried here to undermine metaphysics in general. Indeed, as I argue in some detail in my Reason and Practice, there are metaphysical accounts which are quite in order and are indeed important in any systematic perspicious representation of our concepts. My arguments in the present context are directed at a certain kind of metaphysic and a certain conception of how viewing metaphysics as a discipline which gives a holistic interpretation of the facts, rather than providing new factual knowledge, does not enable us to solve or bypass vexing problems about the logical status of non- anthropomorphic God-talk. And Walsh, as distinct from Mitchell, in effect agrees with me, for he remarks in commenting on the kind of illumination we receive from classical metaphysical works that one " cannot go through the processes of studying such writings and remain totally unaltered by the experience. And the alteration that occurs is not that one is, per impossible, put in touch with things supersensible, as if by some sort of intellectual spiritualism; it is rather that, after appreciating the author's point of view and grasping his system of ideas, one as it were sees familiar things with fresh eyes. Whatever the explanation, we have to admit that people find metaphysical works illuminating and revealing. To claim that they reveal what lies beyond experi- ence would be to claim that they reveal the unrevealable" (Walsh, p. 200). Walsh more extensively develops his accounts of metaphysics in his Metaphysics (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1963). I have extensively commented on the claims and varieties of metaphysics in my Reason and Practice (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 197 I), PP. 393-522- 10 C. B. Martin, Religious Belief (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1959), pp. 7-16.</page><page sequence="13">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God fact, namely, that there is a God, that atheists are denying or that agnostics question, that is, agnostics believe that it could be a fact that there is a God but wonder if such a religious claim is really true. But, on Mitchell's view, the cognitive difference between belief and unbelief or between religious belief and religious belief, for example, Hinduism and Islam, is like the difference between two people who talk about the same thing in different languages. Another analogy- perhaps an analogy that Mitchell would be happier with-is that for him the difference between belief and unbelief is like the difference between phenomenalism and physicalism or nominalism and scholastic realism, as these differences are seen by analytic philosophers like A. J. Ayer. It finally is all a matter of what conceptual framework, what universe of discourse, you want to choose. There are and can be no substantive differences on such an account (e.g., Ayer's) between the phenomenalist and the physicalist or between the atheist and the believer. There is only a difference in how we are going to speak and how we are going to organize or represent the facts. But if this analogy is apt, does it not become evident that Mitchell's proposal, in the last analysis, comes down to nothing more than a dressed-up version of the claim that the theist and the atheist have different picture preferences? It might be argued that I am being unfair to Mitchell. We judge these conceptual schemes, these metaphysical views, by criteria of consistency, coherence, and the capacity to illuminate. We need not be reduced to simply arguing about differing picture preferences. Well, consistency and coherence are indeed necessary conditions for good physical or biological science, for a good normative ethics, or for a good system of any sort, but they are not sufficient conditions. There are plenty of paranoid systems with a tolerable degree of coherence and consistency; a sufficiently intelligent paranoid could construct a perfectly coherent and consistent but utterly fantastic system. Many a poor soul who believes he is Napoleon, Stalin, or Hitler can make out a consistent, coherent case for himself, if we will only share with him certain initial assumptions. But these crazy systems, it will be replied, lack the power to illuminate. It will be maintained, however, that by contrast the conceptual schemes and the great metaphysical schemes of the past have this power to illuminate. There is a crucial ambiguity here that must be brought to light. How, if at all, do such systems illuminate ? I want to say never qua metaphysical systems. But this is a dark saying that needs explanation. In most of the great metaphysical systems-preeminently in Plato and 211</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion Aristotle, Scotus and Occam, Kant and Schopenhauer-we find brilliant conceptual analyses, that is, arguments of the same kind (though often in a radically different idiom) that we find in the works of antimetaphysical analytic philosophers. But the way these analyses have a capacity to illuminate has little or nothing to do with the acceptance or rejection or even the understanding of these great metaphysical systems or schemes. Plato's metaphysical system, like Plotinus', is best viewed anthropologically as a bit of tribal folklore. But, as any reader of the Republic, the Protagoros, or the Theatetus knows, there are in Plato brilliant and illuminating conceptual elucidations. But the striking illumination we gain from these analyses can be assimilated and used without a commitment to Plato's metaphysical system. However, as Passmore has stressed, there are other things in these metaphysical philosophers as well."l These metaphysicians are, in Passmore's terms, also sages. In the traditional metaphysicians I have mentioned and many more-including such lovers of mystagogy as Plotinus, Schelling, and Heidegger-there occur penetrating, riddling, but insightful remarks about life. But such remarks also occur, and usually in a far more articulate and penetrating form, in the great works of literature. There is far more wisdom and a profounder coming to grips with the problems of human existence in the works of Tolstoy, George Eliot, and Camus than in Plotinus, Schelling, or Heidegger.12 Some will reject this. Some think that Heidegger is a brilliant literary psychologist masquerading as a metaphysician, and some even believe that in psychological insight alone there are certain passages in Heidegger that are seldom matched in literature. I think it would be very difficult to sustain this claim. But whether I am right or not in my judgment about the novelists and the metaphysicians, the sage remarks and insights into the human condition of such writers as Plotinus, Schelling, and Heidegger have no logical connection with their metaphysical systems. Such psychological passages often do 212 11 John Passmore, " Philosophy," Encyclopedia of Philosophy, vol. 6, ed. Paul Edwards (New York: Macmillan, 1967), pp. 216-19. 12 That some poets and novelists have been of a different opinion, for example, that Coleridge and Wordsworth never supposed that their poetry came near Spinoza's Ethics in capacity to illuminate does not affect my claim. Some poets and novelists have an exaggerated respect for metaphysical rubbish, for example, Shelley's admira- tion for Plotinus, and Spinoza was a deeper man than Coleridge or Wordsworth. But we still learn more about the human condition from War and Peace than we do from Being and Time.</page><page sequence="15">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God illuminate, but in a radically different manner from the way in which philosophical analysis illuminates. Yet, consider the metaphysical systems themselves-the grandiose, but obscure conceptual schemes- how do they have the capacity to illuminate? Do they really give us any illumination at all? What vision or understanding can we or do we gain from them? The Bible, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Upanishads exhibit a powerful moral vision and depth of insight into our human lot along with some nonsense, superstition, and crudities. The vision and insight is precious, but, as Santayana so well realized, such insight is perfectly available to the atheist. Yet, taken as grand metaphysical schemes, do the metaphysical systems of the past or the existentialist schemes of the present, so justly parodied by Giinter Grass, have a capacity to illuminate ? 13 The answer is that they do not. What they do is mystify, obfuscate, and obscure and give the man caught up by them the illusory belief that the sage remarks gain a profound but mysterious support from the metaphysical superstructure. The two sets of remarks do come from the same volumes; sometimes even a given paragraph will have a mingling of both. The unwary are deluded into thinking that in some way the metaphysical superstructure gives the sage remarks some unfathomable, but absolutely crucial support, that is somehow quite independent of the whims of mortal will. The neophyte and plenty of others too have the very mistaken belief that if they will only study the system long enough, learn finally to penetrate the obscurities, see the rationale that remains hidden in these metaphysical thickets, that they too will finally discover a deep rationale or justification for living in a certain way and for viewing life in a certain way. Here we have the irrational, metaphysical heart of philosophical rationalism. There is no such illumination in metaphysical systems, in theological systems, and in the living religions. VI Someone who has thought about " seeing as " and Jastrow's ambiguous "duck-rabbit" might wish to push Mitchell's claim in the following direction: though "There is a God" or "God loves all mankind" are not even verifiable in principle, they are still cognitively meaningful, for they are used to signal that the sincere user of that utterance looks at the world in a certain way: that he will interpret everything that happens as if there were a God who loves all mankind. 213 13 See his parody of Heidegger in Dog rears.</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion This rather popular move perplexes me in at least three ways: (I) just what does it mean and how could it be an answer to the question, Does " God exists " mean " ... ? " (2) how could it ever be adequate to a religious man's intentions, and (3) what of the morality of such an appeal ? Indeed, given that a man understands what "God exists" or "God loves all mankind" means-that he understands what kind of truth claim is being made-he could understand what it would be like to interpret everything that happens as if there were a God who loves all mankind. But for the man who is puzzled about what it means to assert "God exists," this interpretative point of view does not help at all. For if he does not understand " God," he will not understand what it is to interpret or look at the world in a theistic way. The interpretive point of view just does not come to grips with this logically prior question of meaning. There is a further difficulty here. "Jones sees it as a duck and Fred sees it as a rabbit" is very different from "Jones interprets events atheistically and Fred theistically," for one can turn the Jastrow figure on one side and say (demonstrating one's point by ostension) " There it looks like a duck " and bring in a duck, if need be, to show the resem- blance. But nothing like this can be done to show what it would be like to " look at " or " view'" events atheistically or theistically. Someone who understood what it meant to say that God exists but thought that the assertion was false or rather far fetched, still might, like Ivan in The Brothers Karamazov, argue that people ought to interpret the world theistically or act as if God exists. Indeed a man might say, "I do not know whether God exists and I do not think anybody does either, but I am going to live as if He does; I am even going to interpret events in a theistic manner." Given an understanding of what " God exists" means, that position is perfectly intelligible. I could readily understand a fideist making such a claim. But I could not understand how a Jew or a Christian (fideist or nonfideist) could, while remaining a Jew or Christian, say: "'God exists' only means 'behave agapeis- tically and with humility! Go to synagogue (Church)! Read the Bible and fast on the Day of Atonement (Lent)!, etc., etc.' " This is an utterly secular rather than a religious reading of" God exists." Whatever language game is played by believers with " God," this is plainly not it. And this is also my answer to my second question-can the interpreta- tive view be adequate to a religious man's intentions. My answer is that it cannot. 214</page><page sequence="17">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God It also seems to me to be true that such an argument is extremely questionable on moral grounds. If the world of the Grand Inquisitor were the real world, if man would despair without a belief in God, if life would have no point without a belief in God, then perhaps one should, if one understood that talk, act as if God existed and interpret the world in theistic terms. It indeed distresses me to say this. Part of me says: truth is too precious to be overrun here. But, after all, how could one show truth to be an intrinsic value.'4 Under such circumstances, why make such a thing of truth ? There is, however, no need to accept this cruel dilemma in the first place. It is not true that without a belief in God life is without point and morality is groundless. Whatever ground morality has, it has it in complete logical independence of belief in God. " God is good," " God is the Highest good" are in Jewish-Christian discourses analytic. But "God" does not mean "good" anymore than "puppies" mean "young," for to say "A good wife will try to understand her husband's aspirations" is most certainly not to say, what is nonsense anyway, " A god wife will try to understand her husband's aspirations." " Good " does not mean " God." " There is no God but the napalming of children is evil " is not a contradiction. Furthermore, given this independence of meaning, and given that good is a defining characteristic of God, there is and can be no understanding of " God" without a logically prior understanding of "good" anymore than one could understand " puppy" if one had no understanding of "young." And while for a believer the loss of faith may be a shocking, soul-searing loss, it still remains the case that human love, happiness, companionship, and understanding are of value even in a godless world.'5 Even in such a world the torturing of children remains vile. Indeed, certain "world- renouncing" or "otherwordly" ideals, ideals Steppenwolfian person- alities are inextricably committed to, become absurd with the "death of religion." But other ideals-ideals of human happiness, solidarity, and achievement retain their point. The bliss of religious ecstasy is lost, but the joys of life, refined and nonrefined, are perfectly available in a 215 14 Nietzsche acutely raises such questions. For a powerful insistence on the intrinsic value of truth see Richard Robinson, An Atheist's Values (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964). For a discussion of the pros and cons here, see my "Hedonism and the Ends of Life," Philosophical Journal: Transactions of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow Io, no. I (January 1973): 14-26 15 I have argued this in my Ethics without God (London: Pemberton Books, I973).</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion a Godless world. Such experiences give sense to the remark that even in a world without God such actions can have a point.16 VII Perhaps a better face could be put on Mitchell's claim. We should not lose sight of the fact that Mitchell is talking about the cognitive aspect of theism. Some believers, though by no means all, are in the very nature of the case committed by their faith to an unconditional acceptance of the key claims of their religion. They can no more take them in a tentative way than a lover can be tentative about his love for his beloved. It is certainly true that the Christian, to take one example, does not believe in a God against whom he can bring charges. He could not in a Jamesian fashion characterize his religious beliefs as his " working hypotheses "; they cannot for him be simply his " conceptual scheme," and he cannot think of his religion simply as his Weltan- schauung or the Weltanschauung of his tribe. This does not at all catch his attitude toward his religion: the attitude of faith is one of unconditional trust in God. But, as Mitchell has brought out in another context, such remarks are about the pragmatics of belief: they tell us about the attitudinal reactions of religious believers to religious utterances, but they tell us nothing about the logical status of the utterances them- selves. A wife, desperate for her family's well-being, might passionately aver of her husband "He will not drink again." This is logically a prediction, it is not like his expression of intention "I will not drink again." Indeed, " He will not drink again " may well express the heart- felt wishes of his wife and it could be accepted by her with unswerving and unquestioning faith. But all the same-in spite of its emotive aspects-it has the logical status of a prediction open to confirmation or disconfirmation. That is its cognitive aspect. Similarly, the non- tentative way the believer takes his religious claims in itself establishes nothing about their logical status. What is relevant, and what is involved in our prior discussion, is just what logical status such elements in the conceptual scheme do have. What kind of statements are metaphysical statements? They are not analytic; and Mitchell makes it quite evident that they are not em- pirical, either. But then they cannot be factual, for they are not 216 16 Some of the diverse considerations here are developed in my " An Examination of an Alleged Theological Basis of Morality," IliffReview 2 1, no. 2 (1964): 39-49; and "Linguistic Philosophy and 'The Meaning of Life,"' Cross-Currents 14 (Summer 1964): 313-34-</page><page sequence="19">Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God verifiable (confirmable or infirmable) in principle, but if they are not factual statements, then it cannot be a fact that there is a God, that Hc shall raise the quick and the dead, that He made the world and governs the world. But then the Christian loses his central conception of a transcendent infinite power to whom he can turn in his hour of need. If Mitchell gives up any claim that key religious utterances have a factual status, then his key religious or theological utterances, expressive of "a systematic interpretation of human experience," cannot state facts, cannot be assertive of what there is. If this is so, it appears that Mitchell is indeed open to the charge that he has reduced theism to a mere conceptual scheme touched with emotion. But if this is all it is, he has deprived it, in order to escape perplexities about its claims, of any possibility of making a substantive claim about what there is. By such maneuvering, we can indeed avoid scandal to the intellect, but only at the price of emasculating theism. Mitchell can only rationally resist this criticism by claiming that "God governs the world " or " God shall raise the quick and the dead " are indeed, as interpretations of human experience, factual substantive claims but that they are not even verifiable in principle. But now we are once again back to the classic arguments about whether all factual statements are in principle verifiable (confirmable or disconfirmable). Only if I am mistaken in my claim that to be a factual statement a statement must be confirmable or infirmable in principle, can Mitchell perhaps give some acceptable sense to his claim that these statements are metaphysical statements that provide a fundamental interpretation of our experience. But without this Mitchell's maneuver is without merit. In short, its tenability is completely dependent on the intelligi- bility and tenability of the fundamental claims of philosophical rational- ism. The tenability of such a metaphysical view of the world is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the tenability of such an interpretive point of view. 217</page></plain_text>
