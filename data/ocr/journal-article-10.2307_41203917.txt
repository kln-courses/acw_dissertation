<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCRETIA MOTT</page><page sequence="2">Lucretia Mott MARY R. BEARD T I ^O make "a deep impress on the form and body of an age" so I alive with intellectual and moral ferment as Lucretia Mott's JL required of a personality great mental and moral force. That she was both scholar and innovator is indicated, in a measure, by the fact that when she died in 1 880 her career was described, at a me- morial service, aas a part of the history of the American nation." She was born in 1793 just as the young republic made its d√©but. She left the scene, most appropriately, just as its gilded age began to take on the material flourishes of Old World empires. The new spirit was not in key with her aspirations, for up to the moment of its flowering she had been brilliantly identified instead with the democratic move- ment in America. A sprite in physical size, Mrs. Mott was of heroic spiritual stature. The range of her mind and the clarity of her think- ing, combined with her initiative and energy, made her a power among her fellow citizens who followed her leadership along a straight course of civilized conduct which paralleled the path of bar- barism. Mrs. Mott touched life at many vital points - sharing conspicu- ously in the struggle for more civil liberty, the making of democracy, the liberalization of religious faiths and practices, the awakening of the public to a sense of labor's claims, feminism, the abolition of slav- ery, and civic responsibility generally. Pickaninnies in the cotton fields of the New World and babes in noblemen's homes of England were named "Lucretia" in tribute to her might and majesty. Elderly contemporaries of her own race and nativity were proud to pass en- comiums by her grave. Lucretia Mott undertook to make democratic the class instrument of government which James Madison, "father of the Constitution," composed. She accomplished wonders in demolishing the structure of Protestant superstition and dogma which Thomas Jefferson more privately opposed. Like Alexander Hamilton rather than Thomas 5</page><page sequence="3">The American Scholar Jefferson, she supported commerce and industry, for she sprang from business circles ; but she was never genial about profit-making in the manner approved by the founder of our manufacturing system. Northern wage slaves delighted her no more than Southern chattels and she also had a heart open to the woes of the Indians. Hamilton had based the new industry on the labor of women and "children of a tender age." Mrs. Mott called attention to the evils of this arrange- ment and demanded a deeper consideration of its consequences. A bourgeois by heritage, her ethics were finer grained than the regular code of her kind. Mrs. Mott was a distant relative of Ben- jamin Franklin, and she herself possessed a "shrewdness, humor and commonsense" suggesting Poor Richard} yet she united with this lightness of mood a commanding severity in the presence of greed and intolerance, which sets her off with clear distinction from the au- thor of that famous Almanac. On a philosophical footing with the first thinkers of her country, she was an extraordinarily active cham- pion of the oppressed. While she pondered on the writings of the fa- thers in many fields, she organized and directed thousands of mothers in the task of applying creative philosophy. Against the proscriptions of the Friends in whose sect she grew to maturity, she mingled freely with other sects and joined with the "world's people" in humanistic enterprises. Groping with the learned for the light, in one direction, she also worked with the unlearned for the common cause - civiliza- tion. If there was something "awful in her courage and reproof," there was likewise a "magic in her eloquence and a power in her calm, de- liberate, but pitiless logic" which made of Lucretia Mott more of a pythoness than a virago. Having emphasized her vigor, it is necessary to recall her composure. Indeed she was celebrated for her gentleness as well as for her determination. John Quincy Adams referred to the brightness no less than the strength of her intellect, and her wit was one of her choicest assets. Sarcasm she understood but she used it with restraint and the effect was correspondingly electric when it was brought into play. One phase of her originality lay in her skill with respect to the implements to be employed in arguing and persuading. She was that strangest of strange creatures - a genuine radical with balance. A little story may illustrate the point. Pacifism was her creed and 6</page><page sequence="4">Lucretia Mott her method in many a tight place. When the annual meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society was raided in New York and broken up by a mob on one occasion early in its career, the speakers had to face a rowdy crowd as they left the hall. A gentleman was protecting the tiny Mrs. Mott but she was anxious about other women and urged him to go to their assistance. "Who will take care of you? " he asked. "This man," she replied, quietly taking the arm of one of the rough- est-looking men in the throng; "he will see me safe through." And he did, dazed yet flattered by her confidence. The next day in a res- taurant she saw the leader of that mob sitting at a table. As quietly as she had taken the arm of his husky ally the day before, she moved to the chiePs table and began talking with him. When she left he too was her friend. Who then was this remarkable person who, some say, accom- plished as much as Harriet Beecher Stowe for the abolition of slavery and in addition stamped her personality on every other significant so- cial movement in the United States long before the Civil War and for many years afterward? Lucretia Mott was born a Nantucket Quaker of the old seafaring stock. Her father, Captain Coffin, was often away from home on long voyages during her childhood and her mother had to guide the fam- ily destiny on land. This she did ably, managing to supplement the uncertainties of the sea with the more or less certainties of merchan- dising on the shore. Mrs. Ann Coffin kept a shop, like other wives of sailors, and frequently its prosperity demanded that she go to Boston for supplies, which she procured in exchange for Nantucket oil and candles. The self-reliance that Emerson made a theme of beautiful letters, Mrs. Captain Coffin practiced and developed in everyday life. Lucretia Coffin, however, did not spend her entire youth among the "followers of the sea" and their store-keeping wives. She was sent to school in 1804 when her parents moved to Boston and, although her father adhered to the strict tenets of the Friends concerning habits of industry and caution, his daughter attended now private and now public schools, thus "mingling with all classes without distinction." The program of self-reliance was not to make her narrow. When she was fourteen years of age Lucretia entered a Friends' boarding school at Nine Partners in Dutchess County, New York, be- coming quite a traveled young person among the "states." Her little 7</page><page sequence="5">The American Scholar sister was with her in this institution and the two girls remained there for two years without a single visit home. No week-end parties di- vided their interests between work and play. In fact Lucretia was so diligent about her studies that at the end of her second year she was appointed on the faculty of this school, a position which she accepted partly to enable her small sister to continue her education, there being eight children in the family. The age of eighteen was Lucretia's marriage time and James Mott of old Long Island Quaker ancestry, idealistically inclined, was the bridegroom. They became Philadelphias after that. All accounts agree that the Motts led an exceptionally happy wedded life. Five children came to grace their hearth - children more easily than money, it appears. And in the circumstances their mother, as her own mother had done before, assumed the double burden of housewife and bread-winner, so lauded today by experimenting feminists. In other words, Mrs. Mott had both a "job" and a family. She in her turn had become a business woman. Then James got steadier on his economic feet and Mrs. James turned to preaching, which they now felt they could afford, although the Friends disapproved of paying ministers. At twenty-five Lucretia Mott was a full-fledged expounder of religion in the meetings of her sect, journeying to distant places, from time to time, on this mission. Ten years after she began preaching, that is in 1827-28, the Quaker sect was torn from center to circumference, like the New England Puritans, by religious dissent. In both cases liberals left the orthodox, separation involving questions of dogma, manners, and rationality - in short, modernism versus fundamentalism. Lucretia Mott moved with the liberal Friends and in some respects led the schism. Though she sided with Elias Hicks, the original trouble- maker in her own denomination, in his contention that "God did not need the blood sprinkled on the sacrifice, any more than he needed the smoke that rose from the ancient holocaust," and approved his other attacks on magic, she was no mere satellite but had an inde- pendent mind and will. Akin to the Unitarians, as well, in her attitude toward the Un- known, Mrs. Mott was in all things an amazing rationalist for her day. Apparently she went beyond her kinsman, Benjamin Franklin, and beyond the Southern agnostic, Thomas Jefferson, in her devotion 8</page><page sequence="6">Lucretia Mott to pure reason. She relied steadfastly on the inner light and logic. There was the least possible anthropomorphism in her make-up, con- sidering her day and generation. Her faith, Emersonian in its sweep, was colored by a profound confidence in the universal human nature which Jefferson distrusted in part. To her sister, Martha C. Wright, another great woman of ante- bellum America, Mrs. Mott wrote in the 1 830's a letter containing these views: The more my attention is directed to a studied theology, and systematized Divinity, the more deeply do I deplore its unhappy effect on the mind and character 3 the tendency is to lower the estimate of practical righteousness, and rational Christian duties. How inviting is religion when stripped of the appendages of bigoted sectarism, and gloomy superstition! This is exempli- fied in our friend, J. M. McKim. His mind has at length burst the fetters of Presbyterianism, and, retaining all that is truly "pious" and valuable, he is walking forth in "the liberty wherewith Christ makes free." Evidently in preacher McKim's mental progress, Mrs. Mott had been having a hand, judging from a letter she sent him in 1834: I regret that we cannot procure for thee all that Stuart has written opposed to Channing, because justice requires that we should acquaint ourselves with both sides, before we judge. What is furnished may satisfy thy mind, as far as controversial writings can do this: but permit me to question whether thy present wants will be met by perusal of works of this character. Rather con- sult the volume of thy own experience, and as thou acknowledges thy views slowly brightening, be patient, and rest in full faith for the rising of the sun, when, as thou art able to bear it, all mists and clouds will be dispelled. In the meantime, while reading and studying the Scriptures, let the general tenor of these invaluable writings govern thy conclusions, making all due allow- ance for the time and circumstances in which they were written 5 but do not puzzle and perplex thy mind with inferences from isolated passages here and there, which are contrary to the spirit of the whole, and do violence to the noble gift of reason, divinely bestowed upon us ... while thou holds fast to that excellent sentiment that no text of Scripture however plain can shake thy belief in a truth which thou perceives by intuition, or make thee believe a thing which is contrary to thy innate sense of right and wrong, it will lead thee to frequent introversion, and thou wilt know "of whom thou learnest these things," and wilt not have need that any man should teach thee. . . . Worcester's "Causes of Contentions among Christians" I have in vain looked for, to send thee. Mine was returned a few days since. I enclose it for thy perusal j to be returned when thou hast done with it. John Woolman's 9</page><page sequence="7">The American Scholar Journal, will, as we told thee, bear an attentive perusal 5 and although thou may see some parts strongly marked with Quaker superstitions and technicali- ties, yet lay it not aside on that account. Thou art capable of judging of the spirit of the writer -y let that, with his sound reasoning, commend it to thy notice. I defend not the visionary part. . . . I do not wonder at thy doubts of the propriety of occupying thy "station as minister" in preaching any system of faith, and care not how soon thy Orthodox brethren detect thy heresies 3 although I shall be careful how I ex- pose them, well as I know that thy religious or theological opinions have been for some years past undergoing a change. I want thee to have done with call- ing Unitarian rationalities, "icy philosophizing." The step thou art taking is a serious one, and thy conclusions are of great importance. This was penned, of course, before the age of anthropology! Mrs. Mott likewise influenced capable women to join the crusade for intellectual liberalism. The feminist movement in America owes its origin preeminently to Lucretia Mott, her disciple Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the disciple of the disciple, Susan B. Anthony. To this inspiration derived from a scholarly pioneer, Mrs. Stanton frankly attested. They were traveling companions in 1 840, booked for the World's Anti-Slavery Convention to be held in London, and Mrs. Stanton describes the effect of that association in unmistakable terms: Mrs. Mott was to me an entirely new revelation of womanhood. I sought every opportunity to be at her side, and continually plied her with questions, and I shall never cease to be grateful for the patience and seeming pleasure, with which she fed my hungering soul. On one occasion, with a large party, we visited the British Museum, where it is supposed all people go to see the wonders of the world. On entering, Mrs. Mott and myself sat down near the door to rest for a few moments, telling the party to go on, that we would fol- low. They accordingly explored all the departments of curiosities, supposing we were slowly following at a distance 5 but when they returned, there we sat in the same spot, having seen nothing but each other, wholly absorbed in questions of theology and social life. She had told me of the doctrines and divisions among "Friends" ; of the inward light 5 of Mary Wollstonecraft, her social theories, and her demands of equality for women. I had been reading Combe's Constitution of Many and Moral Philosophy y Channing's works, and Mary Wollstonecraft, though all tabooed by orthodox teachers , but I had never heard a woman talk what, as a Scotch Presbyterian, I had scarcely dared to think. . . . I found in this new friend a woman emancipated from all faith in man- made creeds, from all fear of his denunciations. Nothing was too sacred for her to question, as to its rightfulness in principle and practice. "Truth for IO</page><page sequence="8">Lucretia Mott authority, not authority for truth" was not only the motto of her life, but it was the fixed mental habit in which she most rigidly held herself. . . . When I confessed to her my great enjoyment in works of fiction, dramatic perform- ances, and dancing, and feared that from underneath that Quaker bonnet would come some platitudes on the demoralizing influence of such frivolities, she smiled, and said, "I regard dancing a very harmless amusement" ; and added, "The Evangelical Alliance, that so readily passed a resolution declar- ing dancing a sin for a church member, tables a resolution declaring slavery a sin for a bishop." If the celebrated meeting between Carlyle and Emerson is justly remembered as a subtle expression of intellectual intercourse, the meeting between Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Stanton, more articu- late, was more significant for society. In the same manner, Mrs. Mott made disciples wherever she went. The orthodox Quakers gave her up reluctantly, knowing her power of leadership. And in the new fields which she entered she asserted that directing mind, with a pro- gram which included free religious thinking, serious social question- ing, definitions of behavior with community interests as the stake, and the amicable settlement of all disputes. Whether or not Mrs. Mott's reliance on right reason and her abounding optimism were intuitional or a reflection of a changing intellectual climate to which she was peculiarly adapted, certainly her Biblical scholarship provided her with an arsenal of argument and rich material for exposition. She worked at the Scriptures daily, knew them intimately, quoted accurately, and brought her own in- terpretation to bear against antagonists of a bigoted variety. And if Biblical textual scholarship is now questioned in a period of so many other kinds, let us remember that all mediaeval scholarship rested on Bible learning} that out of its involutions theology was created, that Mrs. Mott's rebellious religious ancestor, George Fox, had not com- pleted his revolution^ that in denying a huge theological superstruc- ture she helped to build for the individual in America a stronger foundation on which to erect a social faith. She knew well the early history of the Fox revolt and the condition of the Church of England at that hour 5 she also knew the constitutional law of the Friends' So- ciety and stood firmly on her rights, as she called for further "prog- ress" - to the annoyance of the complacent. Through no blind im- pulse but through reading and meditation, she burst one bond after another which held the popular thought to rigid molds, while re- 1 1</page><page sequence="9">The American Scholar maining a Quaker minister to the end. Being able to discomfit eccle- siastical experts in their own arena, she set patterns for many of the stirring "Letters to the Clergy" which announced an American womanhood on the left wing, in the fermenting forties. Intimate in knowledge and effective as was her use of Biblical scholarship, Mrs. Mott did not derive her power from the Bible alone. Buckle's History of Civilization shared in the making of her broad culture and ideology. She loved poetry and could recite many splendid passages from memory. Edwin Arnold's Light of Asia was one of her favorite works. She loved action, too, and had observant eyes for realities. Not being cloister-bred, her insight and her energy bore her far beyond the confines of the religious circle and the pulpit, out into the marts of trade where the toiling, moiling masses strug- gled for their daily bread. There she illuminated with her spiritual understanding and emotional flame the thinking of oppressors and oppressed, reckoning even with personal sacrifice in her warfare on avarice. Thus she participated in the boycott of products made by slave labor and continued to live simply, no less than to preach the theory of restraint. At the same time her mental balance forbade an endorsement of the strict Quaker abstention from color, music, and painting. Her version of civilization and culture was truly refined as well as liberal, rationalistic, and humanistic. 12</page></plain_text>
