<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beginnings of Art, to a comparative analysis of Sumerian and Egyp- tian art. Although this reviewer concedes readily a lack of compe- tence in judging art history on esthetic grounds, there crept back an uneasy memory of Woelfflin's absurd disquisitions on the body and soul of brocade folds in Renaissance and Baroque art when con- fronted with Giedion's characterization of disharmonic Sumerian and serene Egyptian art expression, or his insistence on "the laws of the plane surface," permeating the whole book like a leitmotif, referring to the very people who invented sculpture in the round. When we come to architecture, conceptual categories such as monu- mentality, movement, verticality and space establish a workable framework of analysis for architectural history as a timeless con- tinuity. Not form but the ideological intent that creates the form is of the essence. This works extremely well with a culture as coherent and self-contained as Egypt's and establishes Giedion's volume on architecture as predominantly an Egyptian history. Regardless of whether one agrees with specific conceptual interpretations-and there are many objections, especially in the category of space, such as Giedion's incomprehensible adherence to Riegl's purblind theory of Egyptian "space phobia"-his superb perceptive intuition sees fresh values in overly familiar manifestations. For this one can even forgive him some wild, heuristic assumptions that are contradicted by fact: for instance, the origin of stone architecture not as a region- al expedient but as a vehicle of eternity; his derivation of the ziggurat from the pyramid, all chronological evidence to the con- trary; the liquidation of Egyptian sacred writing or Egyptian as- trology-if they do not fit his theory; and in his finest chapter on Hatchepsut and Deir el Bari, suppression of the fact that Senmut was a good eclectic and did not design anything that had not been said 6oo years earlier by Mantuhotep's architect. That rarest of gifts, enthusiasm, makes everything plausible-almost everything, because one basic and tragic throwback to Woelfflin's comparative style analysis does much to arouse anger and rejection. And this is Giedion's comparison between Mesopotamian and Egyptian art and architecture, in a way like Bannister Fletcher, "on the comparative method". No comparison is possible between the design intentions of commercially motivated, theocratic city states, overrun and hy- bridized for 3,000 years by wave after wave of invaders, resulting in a continuous flux of manifestations of the most heterogenous kind; and an absolutistic-feudalistic monarchy with a purely hierarchic, transcendental intent of expression. Just as it is impossible to do justice to Sumer without mentioning the amazing legal and social implications of the Stadtkrone settlement, so it is impossible to deny in the "serenity" of Egyptian art the frozen calm of castrated in- dividuality. To hold up the primitive survival of the most barbaric animal cults as superior to the brilliant rational anthropomorphism of Sumer is to deny the validity of conceptual over deductive reason- ing which Giedion so promisingly introduces as his guiding prin- ciple. Another contribution of great future importance for the revitali- zation of architectural history is Giedion's break with the Greek bias. He has joined our small unpopular commando to whom "Greek art is not the universal standard against which perfection and less than perfection can be assessed." Although Giedion does not escape completely from the "begotted Greek" heritage, ascrib- ing to Plato space theories that simply are not there, or repeating the cliche that Greek temples are "crystals" in limitless space com- positions (surrounded as they were by the tight column porticoes adapted from Egypt), the very essence of his books is that Egypt and not Greece was the mother of art and architecture. There are assertions, again in the disastrous urge to find juxtapositions be- tween unequals, that read like proofreader slips: "The architecture of Egypt and Greece shares the same space conception," coming only a few hundred pages after a detailed core plan of Karnak with the most unparalleled richness in space variations ever created by man; and "the sculpture of Egypt and Greece is fundamentally 217 different," as if relief, derived from cylinder seals, were an Egyptian contribution, and the idealized archaism of the xxv and xxvI dy- nasties could not be recognized in every Greek sculpture to the end of the sixth century. Yet all of the curious intransigence that flouts historical fact and then calls on a host of academic or archaeological drones for respectability, fades into the background before the radiant joy of a mind that has discovered art as religion. The crowning work of Siegfried Giedion's long, devoted and incredibly industrious search for art-historical truth reads like a declaration of faith in the mission of the historian, engraved, of all places, on the door lintel of the United States Senate: THE PAST IS PROLOGUE.
