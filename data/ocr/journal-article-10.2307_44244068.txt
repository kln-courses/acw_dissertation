The writer's status may be not unfairly judged from a passage in his opening chapter. 4 This law of merit and demerit, Karma in the sense of the reign of moral law, is neither particularly Hindu, Buddhist nor Theosophical. It is fundamental in all Oriental philosophy, and was preached by St. Paul. 4 4 Brethren, be not deceived. God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." For the first few centuries of Christianity it remained a cardinal belief in the West. But at the Council of Constantinople, in a.D. 551, the Christian Fathers, finding the doc- trine of Rebirth incompatible with the curious system of thought which they were in the process of creating, decided that belief in Rebirth should be henceforth anathema, and with this doctrine went that which makes it necessary of acceptance, Karma. Now, under the double influence of English translations of the Hindu and Buddhist Scriptures, and the reproclaiming by Mme. Blavatsky of the Ancient Wisdom, or Theosophy, of which all religions are part, Karma and Rebirth have returned to the West.' The author of this remarkable utterance shows himself as remote from the true Oriental as from the true Christian tradition. On the Oriental side, the linking of Theosophy with Hinduism and Buddhism is sufficient evidence of a sort of modern eclecticism which has repeatedly been denounced by the greatest European exponent of traditional Eastern doctrines, namely René Guénon (see L'erreur spirite, ch. 6, for some devastating criticism of such teaching about 4 Rebirth ' as is offered here). On the Christian side, the quotation given displays ignorance enough, but to this may be added the assumption (p. 20) that a personal God is an anthropomorphic God, and the assertion (p. 63) that Christ said of the man born blind that 4 it was he who had sinned, not his father.' To save himself from ignominy, Mr. Humphreys had only to consult one verse of St. John, yet he could not be at the pains to do that. I write this as one who considers it most important that East and West should be reconciled and that either side should endeavour to understand the other's main traditions. But that implies intellectual effort of a kind which in this book is neither accomplished nor attempted. Walter Shewring.</page></plain_text>
