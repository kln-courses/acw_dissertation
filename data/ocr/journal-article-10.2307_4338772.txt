<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henry Hart CHARLES SIMIC'S DARK NIGHTS OF THE SOUL T 5 he prologues are over," Wallace Stevens declared at the beginning of his poem "Asides on the Oboe." "It is a question, now, / Of final belief. So, say that final belief / Must be in a fiction. It is time to choose." Many poets in the twentieth century have wrestled with the dilemma artic- ulated by Stevens: if religious texts, with their apocalyptic beginnings and ends, their gods and devils and redemptive heroes, are fictions, how can they and why should they be believed? William James, who taught at Harvard when Stevens was a student there, advocated a pragmatic approach to the problem. In a lecture delivered in 1900, "Religion and Neurology," which became the first chapter of The Varities of Religious Experiene, he con- tended that religious phenomena should be judged "by their fruits . . . , not by their roots" (34). The fact that sacred texts and rituals could be traced back to idiosyncratic or even pathological visions of religious zealots was no reason to dismiss them, he said. A book like the Bible "may well be a reve- lation in spite of errors and passions and deliberate human composition, if only it be a true record of the inner experiences of great-souled persons wrestling with the crises of their fate" (23). Religious documents, like artis- tic ones, could be "lies"-as Picasso asserted-that nevertheless pointed to realities. They could be literally false, but figuratively true. According to James, "Immediate luminousness, in short, philosophical reasonableness, and moral helpfulness are the only available criteria" for judging the value of religious texts. Since metaphysical statements about the presence or absence of a Supreme Being could not be proved or disproved, one had to exert "the will to believe." Confronted by impenetrable mysteries and uncertainties, one had to "take a leap in the dark" (478). 124</page><page sequence="2">Henry Hart The poet Charles Simic, who grew up in war-ravaged Yugoslavia during the 1940s and emigrated to the U.S. in 1955 as an impoverished teenager, might seem an unlikely inheritor of Stevens's religious dilemmas and James's pragmatic ways of resolving them. From the beginning of his career, however, Simic grappled with many of the same conundrums that preoccupied James and Stevens, and he identified with their unorthodox ways of solving them. With James, whose Varieties of Religious Experi- ence he read in the 1970s, Simic shared a fascination with mysticism as well as a determination to examine its literature from psychological, aes- thetic, and utilitarian points of view. With Stevens, who called his poetry a "mystical theology" in The Necessary Angel, Simic shared both a wari- ness of organized religion and a devotion to the mystic's via negativa that emptied the mind of distractions in order to prepare it for a new vision of creator and creation. Although Stevens rarely alluded to actual mystics in his poems, Simic was more forthcoming. References to Saint Theresa, Saint John of the Cross, Jakob Boehme, Julian of Norwich, and other mys- tics, as well as titles like "The Writings of the Mystics" and "Mystic Life," abound in his work. A little like Dante in the Di'uine Comedy, Simic's contemplative alter egos wander through imaginary hells and heavens where nornal assumptions about time and space don't seem to apply. In his universe, people pedal between the stars, gods walk down stairs to Earth, pedestri- ans bump into shades of the august dead, ancient mystics address disoriented children in the street. Surrealism encouraged Simic to envi- sion such temporal and geographical impossibilities, but so did mysticism, whose traditional goal is a communion between living and dead, present and absent, natural and supernatural. A typical Simic poem begins: "St. John of the Cross wore dark glasses / As he passed me on the street. / St. Theresa of Avila, beautiful and grave, / Turned her back on me. // 'Soul- mate,' they shouted. 'It's high time."' Entitled "The Initiate" ("mystic," from the Greek mustikos and mustes, originally meant "an initiate"), Simic's poem is a fragmentary spiritual autobiography about his early ambivalence toward the mystics-Saint John and Saint Theresa beckon him but also rebuke him. By the end of the poem, he has achieved the sort of intensified consciousness they recommend. "The night, the cold, and the endless walking / Brought on a kind of ecstasy," he says about his 125</page><page sequence="3">The Kenyon Review nocturnal ramble through New York City. "Something supreme was occur- ring / For which there will never be any words.... // In that whole city you could hear a pin drop. / Believe me, / I thought I heard a pin drop and I went looking for it." Traditional mystical quests culminate in ecstatic unions with a divine presence. Simic emphasizes that such traditional "fruits" are elusive in the modem secular world; finding an utterly tran- scendent God-if one even exists-in his urban "dark night of the soul" will be as difficult as finding the proverbial "needle [or pin] in a haystack." His poem ends not with fulfillment, but with a promise that the quest will continue. From his earliest to his latest poems, Simic has revealed an obses- sion with mystical quests and communions. His contemplative insomniacs repeatedly tell of initiatory rites de passage into a night world of purgatorial trials and transcendental mysteries. Often as iconoclastic as past mystics, they demonstrate how their attempts to "know" and "revere" a supreme creator approximate the Church's rituals, symbols, and scriptures. The Church's "fictions," they repeatedly imply, are useful but in need of revision. If Simic's contemplatives commune with God through artifacts resembling the Eucharist, they invariably conclude that God is absent and incommunicative-an enigmatic "other"-or simply dead. If they implore Christ or spiritual masters to inspire them with redemptive visions of sacred love, they usually end up with intimations of profane love amid history's appalling ruins. If they seek knowledge of the universe's creator, they find that the source of being is as unknowable to a contemporary astrophysicist as to a medieval mystic or an initiate in an ancient fertility ritual. In one of his most intriguing early poems, "Dismantling the Silence," Simic introduces many of the mystical motifs that crop up in his later work. Although the narrator could be the poet speaking to himself or to a reader, he sounds more like an idiosyncratic spiritual adviser giving directions to an initiate who is trying to commune with or communicate with a god. Because this god appears to be dead, Simic's speaker begins his instructions like a master mortician telling an apprentice how to embalm a corpse, but it's soon apparent that the dead body is a personification of "the silence" and, more specifically (and somewhat like Sylvia Plath's patriarchal ruin in "The Colossus") of a god's silence. The narrator tells the 126</page><page sequence="4">Henry Hart apprentice how to resurrect the moribund god through a ritual of purga- tion and communion that is ultimately redemptive. The first orders pertain to the body, specifically the ears since they are full of water and perhaps responsible for the god's deafness and silence: Take down its ears first, Carefully, so they don't spill over. With a sharp whistle slit its belly open. If there are ashes in it, close your eyes And blow them whichever way the wind is pointing. If there's water, sleeping water, Bring the root of a flower that hasn't drunk for a month. (Selected Poems 31) The instructor soon reveals that unity between initiate and dead god is the ritual's goal: "When you reach the bones, / Slip them quickly under your skin. / Next time you hunch your shoulders / You'll feel them pressing against your own." The process of incorporating the god's skeleton in order to become godly might not be properly Eucharistic (it seems closer to a ritual in a mystery cult designed to regenerate a wasteland), but the result is the same: man and god have achieved an inspiring union. Having dismantled and re-embodied the divine silence, Simic's communicant proceeds to the final stages of his contemplation. His instruc- tor says: "It is now pitch-dark. / Slowly and with patience / Search for its heart. You will need / To crawl far into the empty heavens / To hear it beat." The silent god (whether it is Christianity's Father, Son, and Holy Ghost or some pagan deity) seems to have represented the silent, deaf, indifferent cosmos all along. As in Stevens's contemplative poems, vocal gods and utopian images that once inhabited orthodox heavens have vanished; the sky is blank. If Simic's quester searches the heavens like a modem astronomer (perhaps he is trying to detect the heartbeat or "cosmic back- ground radiation" of the Big Bang), his ultimate goal is defined with the paradoxes of mysticism. He is supposed to hear the beat of a divine heart that is silent, to dismantle the silences of both a dead god and an empty heaven so that he can hear the orderly music (or "beat") of the spheres, and to use bodily metaphors to describe a communion with a cosmic source that is bodiless and beyond metaphors. As usual, Simic's mystical journey points in two directions: toward a Supreme Being that is immanent in a mortal body as well as emanating from a sacred heart in outer space. 127</page><page sequence="5">The Kenyon Review Although the word "mystical" has been applied to so many differ- ent kinds of experience that it is virtually meaningless today, in the ancient past it denoted the silence and awe surrounding a divine mys- tery-such as the elan vital beating in a mortal or immortal heart. The etymologies of "mystery" and "mystical" reveal entwined roots. "Mystery" derives from musterion (secret rites), muein (to initiate into secret rites), and muein (to close the eyes or mouth, to keep secret). "Mystical" shares a common root with mystery, mu, which evolved into mustes and mustikos (an initiate who remained silent or mute about the mysteries). In pagan Greece, this tight-lipped silence was imposed on initiates who participated in mystery cults honoring Demeter and other Greek gods. In Christian tradition, "mystical" first applied to the "secret" or "silent" meanings hidden behind the Bible's literal meanings. By interpreting bib- lical passages allegorically one could uncover their mystical significance; one could reveal their mystery. As Louis Bouyer explained in "Mysticism / A History of the Word," "mystical" also came to be associated with the Eucharist and the divine realm made accessible by Christ: "For the Greek Fathers the word 'mystical' was used to describe first of all the divine real- ity which Christ brought to us, which the Gospel has revealed.... Moreover, mystical is applied to all knowledge of divine things to which we accede through Christ, and then by derivation, to those things them- selves" (47). It wasn't until the seventeenth century that French philosophers began using the term la mystique, which later got translated into "mysticism" by English scholars. In other words, pre-Enlightenment writers who are now readily labeled mystics never thought of themselves as such; they merely considered themselves devout Christians. (Church authorities, by contrast, regularly accused them of being heretics). Semantic mists and debates have also surrounded words closely related to mysticism, such as "meditation," which in Christian tradition originally referred to the focused reflection on sacred scriptures at the beginning of devotional exercises. Meditation, in some cases, proceeded to "contemplation" (from the Latin contemplum-an observation of auguries in a temple) or "contemplative prayer." Contemplation was con- sidered a higher, more intense stage of meditation, and one that could culminate in ecstatic union with God. Over the past few centuries, the sublime psychological phenomena (visions, voices, transports, raptures) 128</page><page sequence="6">Henry Hart associated with the "contemplation" of God have come to define the essence of "mystical" experience. If there is "one story and one story only" that informs Simic's work, it is closely related to mystical quests of the past. It involves a silent, solitary initiate with meditative and contemplative impulses who attempts to commune with or somehow journey toward a supreme being beyond the sort of suffering he witnessed as a boy growing up in Yugoslavia. His many nocturnal journeys draw on a long contemplative tradition preoc- cupied with making contact with a mysterious divine source within the soul or within the cosmos. Traversing the sort of purgatorial "dark nights of the soul" elucidated by Pseudo-Dionysius, the anonymous author of The Cloudl of Unknowing, Saint John of the Cross, and other "negative the- ologians" who believe God can only be approached through linguistic and conceptual negations, Simic's personae hesitate to say they have found "God" partly because, as Pseudo-Dionysius wrote in The DTine Names: "The inscrutable One is out of the reach of every rational process. Nor can any words come up to the inexpressible Good, this One, this Source of all unity, this supra-existent Being" (50). In Simic's poetry, "God" is simply a pragmatic word-a fiction or mythic symbol-that gestures toward an unfathomable "other" at the source of all being. Simic once contended that there were three fundamental ways of looking at the world-either as "Cosmos," "History," or "Nature"-and each perspective was in dynamic tension with the others. Simic's mystical poetry traces a path through the horrors of history toward the sublime voids of the cosmos-toward "the empty spirit / in empty space" as Stevens put it in "The American Sublime." Transcendent vision, however, is tran- sient, illusory; cosmic voids dazzle as well as frighten Simic's stargazers back to the quotidian. Having returned to earth, they find little content- ment in society and the nightmares of history, so they seek consolation in nature. Despite its seductive beauty, nature turns out to be just as violent as society and history. Reflecting on the dialectical relationship between these three viewpoints, Simic admitted in The Unemployed Fortune-Teller: "I myself fancy the cosmic angle. The brain-chilling infinities and silences of modern astronomy and Pascalian thought impress me deeply, except that I'm also a child of History. I've seen tanks, piles of corpses, and people strung from lampposts with my own eyes. As for Nature so-called, it's a 129</page><page sequence="7">The Kenyon Review product of Romantic utopias" (21). If "Cosmos," "History," and "Nature" constitute the zones of Simic's contemplative quests, his ambivalence toward each of them acts as a goad that keeps him striking out in new directions. Simic explains in The Orphan Factory: "I was always attracted to mystical and esoteric doctrines that propose the unknowingness of the Supreme Being, the ineffability of the experience of his presence and the ambiguity of our human condition.... If I believe in anything, it is the dark night of the soul. Awe is my religion, and mystery is its church" (19). Simic's mystical itinerary is both traditional and untraditional, empirical and metaphysical. It leads to a church with a small "c," a sense of awe before the presence (or absence) of a Supreme Being, and a conviction that the comedies and tragedies of human existence are put into perspec- tive by the mysteries of the cosmos. If he contemplates the First Cause through the lens of a telescope, he speaks about what he sees (or doesn't see) with the ambiguous vocabulary of a mystic. He obsessively pays hom- age to a Supreme Being, even while admitting that the Supreme Being is ultimately unnameable-a mythical term for an absence that cannot be presented or represented. Simic's approach to mysticism has been ecumenical and ambiva- lent from the start. When Christian symbols, rituals, and myths appeared in his early poems in the 1950s, they usually did so in unorthodox and often comical ways that underscored their contingent status. Like other modem poets, he viewed the mystical quest as archetypal, as a version of the "monomyth"-as Joseph Campbell called it-that commenced with a departure from home; proceeded through initiations, trials, and triumphs; and ended with a return to everyday life with lessons learned. Evelyn Underhill's monumental study, Mysticism, which Simic read around 1959 (and several times afterward) encouraged him to take this mythical view. Despite her obvious preference for Western mysticism, Underhill sub- scribed to the notion that the mystical quest was "an inward Odyssey" (91) with a universal plot articulated in different ways by different cultures. Although theologians such as Origin and Pseudo-Dionysius had divided the via mystica into three stages-purification, illumination, and union- Underhill preferred five stages: (1) the joyous "awakening of the Self to the Divine Reality"; (2) the selfs painful realization of its imperfections and 130</page><page sequence="8">Henry Hart consequent desire to purge "all that stands in the way of its progress towards union with God"; (3) the detachment from sensory experience that brings about "Illumination" or "the contemplative state par excel- lence .. . , a certain apprehension of the Absolute, a sense of the Divine Presence"; (4) the radical purification of the self referred to as the "mys- tic pain," "mystic death," "spiritual crucifixion," or "dark night of the soul"; and (5) the ecstatic union in which "the Absolute Life is not merely perceived and enjoyed by the Self, as in Illumination: but is one with it" (169-70). According to Underhill, the Western (as opposed to the Eastern) mystic's journey ended with a return to redemptive work in the world rather than with a transcendent union in a blissful void. The Western quest was cyclical rather than vertical. Its ultimate goal was active and outward-looking, not passive and inward-looking. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Simic read many books about mysticism that contributed to his understanding of the fundamental nar- rative delineated by Underhill. Among the most influential were works by Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, the anonymous author of The Cloud of Unknowing, the authors of the Philokalai (a collection of devotional writings by monks in the Eastern Orthodox Church), Jakob Boehme, Saint John of the Cross, P. D. Ouspensky, Lama Anagorika Govinda, and Heinrich Zimmer. He acknowledged that his interest in mysticism never waned; he continued to read "numerous books on [Christian mysticism], Sufism, Taoism, and Buddhism. . . over the years" (letter, 10 July 2003). What these various writers and texts impressed upon Simic was the neces- sity for meditative detachment from painful experience (historical calamity was a catalyst for many mystical writings); a silent, solitary, and disciplined search for a divine origin beyond space and time; and a recog- nition of the ineffable and unknowable mystery inherent in all being. Like his precursors, Simic traced the up-and-down, back-and-forth rhythms of the mystic's spiritual adventure, often juxtaposing ecstatic ascents with farcical returns, sublime unions with tragic denouements. If Underhill's Mysticism corroborated Simic's suspicion that there was an archetypal structure to the mystical journey, Zimmer's Philosophies of India (which he read around the same time as Mysticism) broadened his ecumenical view. "Iruth," Zimmer wrote, "is universally one and the same ... [but it] appears differently in different lands and ages according to the 131</page><page sequence="9">The Kenyon Review living materials out of which its symbols are hewn.... Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are.... Through all of these a transcendent reality is mirrored ... which ... is ineffable" (1-2). Regard- ing the Christian's literal-minded belief in an anthropomorphic God and an actual heaven, Zimmer said: "Beyond the Milky Way are only island universes, galaxy beyond galaxy in the infinitudes of space-no realm of angels, no heavenly mansions, no choirs of the blessed surrounding the divine throne of the Father" (13). Opposed to an outward Christian search for a God beyond the stars, Zimmer recommended an Eastern, meditative search for the Brahman power and truth inside the self. For Simic, who sympathized with these depictions of empty heavens and inward powers, Lama Govinda's Foundations of libetan Mysticism also exerted an imme- diate appeal. Through Buddhist meditation, Govinda explained, an individual could attain the enlightened, blissful, "all-encompassing cosmic consciousness" that was "beyond words and concepts" (23). This "cosmic consciousness," he stipulated, was something internal even though it encapsulated the external cosmos. The Christian mystics who influenced Simic advocated a contem- plative quest for a God that was just as ineffable and inscrutable as Eastern conceptions of divinity. Negative or "apophatic" theologies of Western mystics dovetailed with Simic's skeptical, scientific intellect. Of the vari- ous monastic contemplatives Simic studied at the beginning of his career, it was probably the neo-Platonic Pseudo-Dionysius who provided the most lucid introduction to Christian apophaticism. The unknown writer, who may have been a sixth-century Syrian monk, suggested that "God" was merely a useful fiction or symbol for the incomprehensible mystery at the source of all being. "We use whatever appropriate symbols we can for the things of God" (53), he wrote, but when the mind unifies with God it real- izes that God is utterly transcendent: "It [i.e. God] is at a total remove from every condition, movement, life, imagination, conjecture, name, dis- course, thought, conception, being, rest, dwelling, unity, limit, infinity, [and] the totality of existence" (54). For the dialectical Dionysius, God "is all," yet "he is no thing" (56). He is present in everything, yet he is the ulti- mate absence. He is a word-the Word-but no word. His name re-presents that which can never be presented. Many of these paradoxical ideas about God's immanence and 132</page><page sequence="10">Henry Hart transcendence also appear in Meister Eckhart's writings, which Simic read in the early 1960s. For Eckhart, who lived in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, union with God-what he sometimes called the "Birth of the Son in the Soul" or the "Breaking-Through to the Divine Ground" (47)-also led to a conviction of God's intractable othemess. Eckhart's suggestion that the soul created God harked back to Pseudo- Dionysius's modem-sounding contention that "God" was simply a word fabricated by humans for a Creator that couldn't be represented by words. The purpose of the contemplative journey, according to Eckhart, was to glimpse "the hidden darkness of the eternal divinity" (196) that defied understanding. God, it seemed, was an absolute void-frightening to some, sacred and astonishing to others. "I pray to God that he may make me free of 'God,' for my real being is above God if we take 'God' to be the beginning of created things" (202), Eckhart said in one of his sermons. Was his Christian mysticism atheistical? He declared: "If I say: 'God is a being,' it is not true; he is a ... transcending nothingness" (207). For these and other iconoclastic claims, Eckhart was tried and condemned for heresy. It was Simic's father, George, who sparked his son's interest in the bewildering paradoxes of "negative theology" during the 1950s by leaving piles of books on Buddhist, Hindu, Sufi, Jewish, and Christian mysticism around the house. In their long discussions about the credibility of these esoteric doctrines, George tried to convince his skeptical son to adopt their principles and also to adopt the principles of the little-known Gurd- jieff movement, which he had already joined. At first, Charles resisted the Gurdjieffians, but later relented. In the essay "Esotericism," which he refrained from publishing because he thought he could never do justice to his first encounter with organized "spiritual exercises," he recounted: "I joined the movement in the fall of 1963, and although I only remained in it for little more than two years, the experience did change my life" (1). Among other things, when he visited his father's teacher, Mrs. Benson, on New York's East 72nd Street, he got practical instruction in a form of med- itation that in some ways resembled the kinds of meditation and contemplation he had already read about in numerous mystical books. Simic's initial meeting with the woman who would become his spiritual adviser was full of surprises. "There was nothing mystical" about 133</page><page sequence="11">The Kenyon Review her apartment or herself. "She looked like any other wealthy, well- groomed woman one caught sight of along Madison Avenue." After chatting for an hour, she "got down to serious business." Simic recalled: There was one little exercise she wanted me to try to do before we met again. Find a hard chair, I remember her saying, and sit in it with your back straight and your bare feet firmly on the floor. Do it every morning for ten minutes after you get up. Sit until you collect yourself, then shut your eyes and focus attention on your body starting with your feet, trying in the process to sense every toe, every joint, every muscle while moving higher and higher till you finally reach your head and your face.... Do it for a week, she said in conclusion, and report to me next time I see you how it went. To someone like me in the habit of imagining and speculating intellectually about all sorts of experiences including mystical ones, this was a bit of a letdown. I couldn't imagine what purpose this so-called moming exercise could have. I knew that Gurdjieff like Emerson regarded ideas untested by experiences as worthless and I agreed wholeheartedly in the abstract, but putting that into practice was some- thing entirely different. The premise of the exercise, as I came to realize, was very simple. What needs to be experienced no one else can explain and describe to us. Until one grasps some small, fundamental truth about oneself, there is really no hope of going farther. In that respect, there was nothing "esoteric" about Gurdjieffs method. It was thoroughly empirical. (2-3) What he learned from Mrs. Benson's first assignment and the weekly meetings that followed it was mental discipline, "to sustain one's atten- tion" in silence and solitude without being sidetracked by the innumerable sensations that constantly bombard consciousness. He learned to describe his experiences as truthfully as possible, "proceeding from experience to experience, from bits of understanding to under- standing, verifying everything and postponing any generalizations one was tempted to make." He also learned that "there are many degrees and nuances of self-consciousness within us" from our everyday awareness of ourselves as workers or lovers or daydreamers to mystical "moments of truly extraordinary clarity" (5-7). Little is known about the early life of the man who formulated the meditational exercises that Simic practiced. According to some biogra- phies, George Gurdjieff was born near the Caspian Sea in the late 1860s or early 1870s and was raised in the Greek or Russian Orthodox Church. 134</page><page sequence="12">Henry Hart Accounts of his life usually begin with his travels in Russia during the first decades of the twentieth century and his move in 1922 to France where he established several experimental centers to study consciousness. These studies, as Simic realized in his sessions with Mrs. Benson, usually involved rigorous self-scrutiny and frank self-expression. As for Socrates and Freud, for Gurdjieff healthy-mindedness lay in the ability to "know thyself' and to articulate the thoughts and feelings of that self without concealment or exaggeration. To disseminate his creed, Gurdjieff made several trips to the United States in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. There he attracted a substantial following among writers and artists (one study done in the 1990s claimed there were approximately five thousand Gurdjieffi- ans in the United States). It was the book In Search of the Miraculous, Framents of an Unknown 7aching, by Gurdjieff's most important student, P. D. Ouspensky, that gave Simic a detailed account of the thinker whose movement he joined. Ouspensky sounded remarkably like Underhill in Mysticism when he claimed: "Beyond the thin film of false reality there existed another reality from which, for some reason, something separated us. The 'mirac- ulous' was a penetration into this unknown reality" (3). While Ouspensky showed how Gurdjieffs ideas were at times vaguely Christian and mysti- cal, he also underscored how they diverged from most orthodoxies. According to Ouspensky, Gurdjieff had grown up "in an atmosphere of fairy tales, legends, and [occult] traditions. The 'miraculous' around him was an actual fact.... All these things taken together had created in him at a very early age a leaning towards the mysterious, the incomprehensi- ble, and the magical" (36). Later on, Gurdjieff came to counterbalance his occult leanings with hard-nosed materialism and determinism. He claimed that "knowledge, like everything else in the world, is material" (37) and people are "machines working solely under the power of external influ- ences" (19). Only through "a complete change of life .. ., a renunciation of all worldly things" (47) could someone gain freedom from the sort of influences that so often propel history toward nightmare. What is most striking about Gurdjieffs system is its bricowe, its attempt to cobble together all sorts of seemingly incompatible points of view. He takes Marxist ideas about materialism, Freudian ideas about psy- chotherapy, Darwinian ideas about evolution, mixes them with his own 135</page><page sequence="13">The Kenyon Review strange notions of alchemy and astrology, and produces a Byzantine system to explain the development of personality and history. What attracted Simic most to Gurdjieff was not his idiosyncratic doctrines, but his Socratic emphasis on mental attentiveness and self-awareness. "Our start- ing point," Ouspensky records Gurdjieff as saying, "is that man does not know himself, that he is not. . . what he can and what he should be." To attain enlightenment, one had to understand and tell the truth about one's self or selves (Gurdjieff insisted that everyone contained a plurality of selves). One way to escape the mechanical body and the mechanical depredations of history, he believed, was by taking "mental photographs" (146) and arranging them into a candid autobiography. On one level, Simic had already started to compose such mental autobiographies-how- ever obliquely or surrealistically-in his poems during the early 1960s. Gurdjieffs meditational exercises encouraged Simic to continue his self- assessments, just as Gurdjieffs zany alchemical and astrological theories undoubtedly encouraged Simic to release the more fanciful side of his imagination. When Simic in his essay "Charles the Obscure" spoke of his attraction to doctrines concerning the "dark night of the soul" and an unknowable Supreme Being, he was alluding to Saint John of the Cross's treatise on contemplation, The Dark Night, as much as to In Search of the Miraculous and other books on mysticism. (By referring to himself as "obscure," he may have been punning on the original Spanish title of Saint John's book, La Noche Oscura). The itinerary for the contemplative soul mapped by the sixteenth-century Spanish monk had a lasting effect on Simic. The Dark Night, which is a long explication of Saint John's poem by that name, stressed the need for the sort of self-examination espoused by the Gurdjieffians, but the goal of his spiritual exercises was Christian. He called for "a loving and peaceful attentiveness" (317), "knowledge of self' (321), and a repudiation of the "distracted and inattentive spirit" so that it could be "illumined, clarified, and recollected by means of the hard- ships and conflicts of the night" and, in the end, unified with God (331). If Gurdjieff emphasized a harmonious acceptance of the body and mind through meditation, the Catholic Saint John aimed for a mortifying renun- ciation of all bodily and mental processes so that the soul could be infused with the presence of God. By negating what he called the "sensory and 136</page><page sequence="14">Henry Hart spiritual parts" of the soul, "that is: all the faculties, passions, affections, and appetites" (362), the contemplative could transcend all agonizing tri- als in the world and "enjoy a wondrous and delightful spiritual communication [with God], at times ineffably sublime" (385). Although Father, Son, and Holy Ghost periodically seemed to abandon the soul dur- ing its purgatorial journey, for Saint John the Trinity was always waiting in the wings, ready to dispense grace and arouse feelings of sacred love to keep the soul moving on its transcendental trajectory. Simic has claimed that "every poem, knowingly, or unknowingly, is addressed to God" (Orphan Factory 21), but he has always been more skeptical and apophatic than Saint John, even to the point of embracing atheism in his quests for a Supreme Being. Simic gravitated toward Saint John's descriptions of the soul's "dark night" partly because Saint John was a lyric poet who wrote about silence, solitude, and mental intensity as if he were writing a manual about artistic creation. Drawn to his psycho- logical insights, Simic also realized that the saint's depiction of the development of mystical consciousness in terms of a boy growing up, leav- ing a parent to serve a new master, and faring forth on a journey full of lonely trials and ambiguous triumphs, was a kind of allegory of his own life. According to Saint John, the soul traveled on "unknown roads" through an "unknown land" (365), witnessed "fire [that] . . . annihilates, empties, and consumes" (339) in "war or combat" (349), felt confined in a "dark dungeon" (341), and hoped to be "saved in the darkness of this night ... [when] the soul subtly escapes from its enemies, who were always opposed to its departure." The spiritual thirst, hunger, and poverty docu- mented by Saint John were all-too-real experiences for Simic in Yugoslavia during and after World War 11. His "dark nights of the soul" were literal and figurative. The poems he later wrote about contemplative journeys toward otherworldly mysteries and redemptive loves were all the more haunting because they often traced the actual journeys that inspired them. If Hitler and Stalin were his travel agents, as Simic said about his nomadic early life in Yugoslavia, France, and the United States, then Saint John was one of his principal guides. By painstakingly delineating corre- spondences between external and internal realities, Saint John helped Simic allegorize his disorienting experiences and find his voice as a poet. In a typical elaboration of the figurative meaning of his poem, "The Dark 137</page><page sequence="15">The Kenyon Review Night," which recounts the journey of a solitary figure from a darkened house toward a romantic tryst, Saint John wrote: The darkness . . . here relates to the sensory, the interior, and the spir- itual appetites and faculties, because this night darkens their natural light so that through the purgation of this light they may be illumined supernaturally. It puts the sensory and spiritual appetites to sleep, dead- ens them, and deprives them of the ability to find pleasure in anything. It binds the imagination and impedes it from doing any good discursive work. It makes the memory cease, the intellect become dark and unable to understand anything, and hence it causes the will also to become and and constrained, and all the faculties empty and useless. And over all this hangs a dense and burdensome cloud which afflicts the soul and keeps it withdrawn from God. (363) This "dark night" or "cloud of unknowing" is fraught with anxiety, but it is supposed to purify the mind in its pursuit of union with God. In Simic's poems, the "dark night" of purged appetites and dead- ened faculties, of solitude and silence and anxiety, is often a condition imposed by circumstances beyond the individual's control rather than, as in Saint John's Dark Night, a condition sought by a devout soul attempt- ing to get closer to God. On their many night journeys, Simic's personae confront a universe that seems indifferent to the plight of humanity. His- torical disasters like the ones he witnessed in Yugoslavia are frequently invoked as evidence of God's brutality or absence. But in these poems, as in many traditional accounts of the mystic's via negativa, Simic repudi- ates anthropomorphic conceptions of God in order to stress the unknowable "something" (or "nothing") that the word "God" tries to rep- resent. His many communions with God-like avatars often proceed irreverently toward an intimation of the sheer mystery of the universe the unlikely fact that it came into being at all-and the unlikelihood of his own existence in it. He identifies with Pascal, who wrote in Pensees: "When I consider the brief span of my life absorbed into the eternity which comes before and aer ... the small space I occupy and which I see swallowed up in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I know nothing and which know nothing of me, I take fright and I am amazed to see myself here rather than there .. ., now rather than then." (48) 138</page><page sequence="16">Henry Hart The many insects that populate Simic's poems are part of his ongoing fable that dramatizes how miniscule humans are in the "infinite immensity of spaces" as well as how godlike tyrants and tyrannical gods have treated humans throughout history, exterminating them as if they were so many insignificant, irritating bugs. Placed at the beginning of his Selected Poems, "Butcher Shop" serves as an eerie introduction to Simic's preoccupations with mystery, history, and a "dark night of the soul" that is both purgative and redemp- tive. The poem begins with the lyrical simplicity of Saint John's poem "The Dark Night"; a solitary night-walker stops to gaze at something he desires and then experiences an epiphany that transports him from his material surroundings. Simic's poem, however, strings together gruesome images from his traumatic European past (tunneling convict, blood- soaked apron, continents of blood, glittering knives, broken bones) in a disjunctive way that highlights the randomness of both poetic creation and historical destruction. Rather than use erotic love, like Saint John, as a metaphor for the sacred love and contemplative union between soul and God, Simic dwells on metaphors of sacred and profane eating. Neverthe- less, Simic's purpose resembles Saint John's; he also wants to dramatize the journey beyond sensory appetites toward the fulfillment of spiritual ones. Peering into a closed butcher shop, Simic's contemplative wanderer quickly forgets about his actual hunger when he sees the blood spattered on the butcher's apron. The stained garment overwhelms him with mem- ories of world wars in which millions of innocent people have been butchered like innocent animals. In his imagination, the blood on the apron is "smeared into a map / Of the great continents of blood, / The great rivers and oceans of blood." He associates the deaths of history's multi- tudes with the death of Jesus, whose sacrificed flesh and blood provides sustenance for the brutalized and needy. In Simic's stream of seemingly chaotic associations, visceral hungers and historical killings make way for redemptive ones. The butcher's knives "glitter like altars / In a dark church / Where they bring the cripple and the imbecile / To be healed." War's casualties-the maimed and shell-shocked-find consolation in Eucharistic communions with the crucified Christ. For Simic's contemplative in "Butcher Shop," Christ's crucifixion serves as a model for "the mystic death," the dying away from sensory 139</page><page sequence="17">The Kenyon Review experience that precedes the soul's union with the divine. Simic finds sym- bols for the soul's aridity and purification in the butcher's "wooden block where bones are broken, / Scraped clean [like] a river dried to its bed." In this wasteland of bones, Simic admits, "I am fed" and "deep in the night I hear a voice." Silence, solitude, and hunger lead to Eucharistic feeding and communication. Does Simic's contemplative experience lead to the sort of union with a mysterious God that occurs at the end of Saint John's Dark Night? Or the sort of colloquy with God that Saint Ignatius of Loyola envi- sioned in his famous Spiritwal Exercises? Simic's persona implies that he may be experiencing something more mundane (the discovery of his poetic voice), or he may be simply "hearing things" (the cry of an animal slaughtered on the butcher's block or a person butchered in war), or he may be hearing someone's actual voice in the city. As in the deceptively simple lyrics by Robert Frost or Robert Bly that served as models for Simic's early poems, the ambiguity in "Butcher Shop" makes the poem more resonant, more haunting, more significant. Underhill divided mystics into those who believed in "emanation- theory" (that God was utterly transcendent, "external to the world which He illuminates and vivifies," and knowable only through His Creation [97]) and those who believed in "immanence-theory" (that God was the "essence or substance, dwelling ... at the apex of man's soul" [1001). Underhill emphasized, however, that many mystics, such as Pseudo- Dionysius and Meister Eckhart, used language common to both theories partly because both were grounded in Christian scripture and rituals. The same could be said about Simic. His contemplative journeys are directed toward divine emanations from nature as well as divine immanences in the mind. Some are apophatic: they propose that God is totally beyond human reason and language, and therefore can only be hinted at with symbols that negate themselves by acknowledging their inadequacy. Oth- ers are cataphatic: they propose that God can be positively identified in the words and rituals that remember Him. Simic's different ways of presenting his concept of a Supreme Being can be traced to his family background as well as to his early read- ings. Although his parents never attended the Serbian Orthodox Church in Yugoslavia, for two centuries his mother's ancestors had served in the Church as priests. Recoiling from this lineage, his mother and matemal 140</page><page sequence="18">Henry Hart grandfather refused to have anything to do with Christianity. By contrast, his father, whose grandfather came from a long line of blacksmiths, enjoyed visiting churches and engaging in religious speculation. "My father believed in God in a vague, metaphysical sort of way, but my mother did not" (letter, 8 Sept. 2003), Simic once remarked. Simic may have tried to reconcile his parents' opposing views through a negative theology that was scientific and atheistical as well as metaphysical and devout. Although his poems sometimes proclaim that the fiction of an anthropo- morphic God is dead, they repeatedly make use of the Church's rituals and symbols to resurrect that dead God and the mystery He once represented. His mystical journeys are divided-outward and inward, cataphatic and apophatic-partly because he inherited his family's religious divisions, but also because, like mystics in the past, he regarded the Creation as a com- plex system of signs fabricated by a creator that no sign could adequately signify. In his early poem "Tapestry," he embodied this ambiguous point of view by depicting the Creation as a text-like textile that "hangs from heaven to earth," behind which there is no Creator, no controlling Author- God, only the mysterious nothingness of "Space, plenty of empty space." Simic's preoccupation with spiritual guides and initiates, and his fondness for the imperative voice that dispenses directions and directives, can also be traced to his divided family-specifically to the fact that he had no father to guide him for a decade during his tumultuous youth (his father escaped Yugoslavia during the Nazi occupation and eventually trav- eled to the United States, where his family joined him in 1954). As for Theodore Roethke, whose father died when he was a teenager, for Simic, mystics and other poets became surrogate fathers. Nearly all the books by or about mystics that he read in the 1950s and 1960s stressed the impor- tance of getting proper instruction from a fatherly mentor. One of the goals of Simic's contemplative method was to invoke the voices of spiritual and poetic "masters" so that they could speak to him and through him to his readers. Usually these tutelary voices fused the directives of Gurdjieff and Mrs. Benson with those of more traditional Christian and Eastern mystics. Repeatedly they called for an intensified awareness of the body, a com- munion with the world's body or with God's body, and finally a recognition of the incorporeal, ineffable source of all bodies. Even Simic's so-called "object poems"-his fanciful discourses on forks, spoons, knives, shoes, 141</page><page sequence="19">The Kenyon Review and stones-deliberately charted spiritual journeys from the body to the transcendent and back again to the body. In "Bestiary for the Fingers of My Right Hand," focusing on his body as if following the Gurdjieffian pre- cepts of Mrs. Benson, Simic's contemplative launches himself on a mystical journey to a Supreme Being beyond the stars as well as inside his own body. His guiding master for this sublime trip is his pointer finger: "The second [finger] points the way. / True Way. The path crosses the earth, / The moon and some stars. / Watch, he points further. / He points to himself." Under the poet's imaginative gaze, a humble finger has become an incarnation of the "True Way," a guide embracing Christian and Taoist transcendence (tao is often translated as "the way"). In the 1980s and 1990s, Simic's poems increasingly emphasized the via mystica's surprising disparities and unities. Although his "mythic method" of inserting ancient mystics in contemporary settings is often hilariously surreal, on one level he is simply following the traditional mys- tical practice of discovering the sacred in the profane, the eternal in the temporal. "First Frost" exemplifies this technique when he describes a fall day in New Hampshire as if it were an objective correlative for the purifi- cations of medieval mystics. Assembled out of fragments from different times and places, his ode to autumn begins matter-of-factly: "The time of the year for the mystics. / October sky and the Cloud of Unknowing. / The routes of eternity beckoning. / Sign and enigma in the humblest of things." In the fourteenth-century book on contemplation, The Cloud of Unknow- ing, the author envisioned the via negativa as a journey through a "cloud of forgetting," which obscured all worldly realities, and into a "cloud of unknowing," which obscured God. "The vigorous working of your imagi- nation, which is always so active when you set yourself to this blind contemplation, must as often be suppressed" (73), he contended, because God transcended all images and all concepts. "He [God] may well be loved, but not thought. By love he can be caught and held, but by think- ing never" (68). "The humblest of things" could be read as signs for God, but in the end the rational, interpretive mind could never know God; He could be approached only through emotion-through reverent love. To stress the correspondence of outside and inside, emanation and immanence, Simic has the seventeenth-century German, Jakob Boehme, whose mystical system combined Christianity with alchemy 142</page><page sequence="20">Henry Hart and astrology, play a kind of foil to the English author of The Cloud of Unknouwing. One appears inside his house, the other outside: "Master cob- bler Jakob Boehme / Sat in our kitchen all morning. / He sipped tea and warned of the quiet To which the wise must school themselves." Perhaps remembering his and his mother's down-to-earth skepticism of such reli- gious talk, Simic introduces a character who deliberately ignores the mystic. In some ways she resembles Stevens's sensual woman in "Sunday Morning" who finds her religious yearnings fulfilled in nature and bodily existence rather than in Christianity: "The young woman paid no atten- tion. / Hair fallen over her eyes, / Breasts loose and damp in her robe, / Stubbornly scrubbing a difficult stain." The woman, who is even more indifferent to Christian transcendentalism than Stevens's feminine alter ego, does not have the last word. The poem ends with a dog, one of Simic's favorite animals (perhaps because dogs also serve masters), and another masterly mystic: "Then the dog's bark brought us all outdoors, / And that wasn't just geese honking, / But Dame Julian of Norwich herself discours- ing / On the marvelous courtesy and homeliness of the Maker." The poem's melange of living and dead reenacts a drama between the spiritual and earthly compulsions in Simic's personality. Although many of his poems mock orthodox concepts of God as a benevolent Being and acknowledge God's absence or death, here Simic lends an ear to another devout fourteenth- century mystic. The "discoursing" he hears probably comes from the thirteenth "Revelation" of Julian's Showings, in which she portrays God as a kindly teacher who, out of pity for human blindness and ignorance, patiently tries to make His mysteries "plain ... so that we may know him and love him and cling to him. For everything which is profitable for us to understand and know our good Lord will most courteously show to us by all the preaching and teaching of Holy Church" (235). Julian's earnest dis- course about God's solicitude, Simic implies, is as authentic and ultimately futile as the discourse of all mystics who try to name and personify the nameless, impersonal Maker. Pondering the limited ability of the human brain to accurately rep- resent the "truth," Simic has observed: "My hunch that language is inadequate when speaking about experience is really a religious idea, what they call negative theology" (Unemployed, 101). In his most recent books, Walking the Black Cat, Jackstraws, and Night Picnic, many of Simic's most 143</page><page sequence="21">The Kenyon Review starding poems continue to reflect on the linguistic quandaries of the reli- gious poet who wants to pay homage to a Supreme Being, but who can only do so by denying the adequacy of his imagination and vocabulary. Again and again, Simic constructs rituals of communion and communication that end in deconstructions and aporias. His poems admit that the divine presence is absent from the words designed to embody it. This deconstructive turn, as the eminent scholar of Western mysticism, Bernard McGinn, observed, has always characterized the writings of negative theologians: "Among the negative or apophatic mystics, presence and absence are ... paradoxically and dialectically simultaneous. If the modern consciousness of God is often of an absent God (absent though not forgotten for the religious per- son), many mystics seem almost to have been prophets of this in their intense realization that the 'real God' becomes a possibility only when the many false gods (even the God of religion) have vanished and the fright- ening abyss of total nothingness is confronted.... That is why many mystics from [Pseudo-] Dionysius on have insisted that it is the con- sciousness of God as negation, which is a form of the absence of God, that is the core of the mystic's journey" (Foundations, xviii-xix). Atheism and agnosticism, to this dialectical view, are simply stages on the via negativa. "De Occulta Philosophia" in Jackstraws is a good example of the way Simic constructs a fanciful allegory about God that deconstructs God's presence into something (sunlight) that represents nothing (His absence). Perhaps recalling Underhill's explanation of emanation theory in which she drew an analogy between the sun and God and between the sun's rays and God's Son-like medium (mystical literature is full of such solar analogies), Simic portrays himself as a humble communicant seek- ing enlightenment through the medium of the sun. Significantly, the word "God" is absent from the poem. Only His sun-like emanation is addressed; only his apophatic nature as the "supreme unknowable" is mentioned. Simic begins characteristically with a quirky obeisance before a spiritual master: "Evening sunlight, / Your humble servant / Seeks initiation / Into your occult ways." The sunlight enters Simic's house like a solitary Christ- like mystic with "inviolable reserve," dispensing enigmatic signs around his study that suggest "some large / And obscure knowledge." Simic feels that the "bloodied" sunset, like the crucified or dead gods in his other poems, can communicate with him. In the end, unfortunately, the sunlight 144</page><page sequence="22">Henry Hart is mute. Neither Son-like sun, divine Word, nor poetic word can represent God's being. The sun, Simic admits, can "tell me absolutely nothing." If the poem intends to be a lyrical evocation of God's presence in the natu- ral world, its conclusion only affirms the mystical intensity needed to recognize God's absence, His nothingness. In poems like "Midsummer Feast" and "Mystic Life" Simic char- acteristically transforms ordinary events (eating, fishing) into poetic rituals that restore contact with the "unsayable," "the supreme unthink- able," and "the Great 'Nothing."' "Night Picnic," the title poem of his most recent book, depicts an ordinary picnic between lovers on a "dark night" as if it were another reenactment of the Eucharist. "All things are imbued uith God's being," a woman at the picnic says. The wine and bread con- sumed under the blank heavens remind Simic's persona, once again, of the divine nothingness of the Creator rather than the blood and body of the living Jesus. Referring to himself, the narrator remarks: You were mulling over the particulars Of your cosmic insignificance Between slow sips of red wine. In the ensuing quiet, you could hear Hler small, sharp teeth chewing the crust- And then finally, she moistened her lips. (Selected Poems 15) His communion with God is like an astronaut's flight into outer space that returns successfully to earth. Love and especially erotic love (the picnick- ing contemplative prepares to kiss his lover at the end) are the goals of his journey. Saint John of the Cross imagined his mystical journey ending in a similar erotic union: "I abandoned and forgot myself, / Laying my face on my Beloved; / All things ceased; I went out from myself, / Leaving my cares / Forgotten among the lilies" (296). Unlike the Catholic saint, who intended his profane metaphors of ecstatic lovemaking to symbolize a spiritual union between soul and God, Simic implies that the kissing dur- ing his "dark night" will be merely sexual. From his early lyrics to his latest in Night Picnic, Simic offers snap- shots of a via negativa that proceeds along a cyclical route through historical sufferings, rituals, meditations, contemplations, and back to soci- ety and nature with a new appreciation for the mystery of being. Following James and his poetic heirs like Wallace Stevens, Simic treats the gods and 145</page><page sequence="23">The Kenyon Review devils of orthodoxy as characters in a "supreme fiction" that should be judged by its fruits-the insights and joys and consolations it makes possi- ble-rather than by its roots. Pondering the question of life's chief concern at the beginning of his chapter "The Religion of Healthy-Mindedness" in The Varieties of Religous Experience, James concluded that the religious person should figure out "How to gain, how to keep, how to recover hap- piness" (76). Simic's mystical fictions, above all, aim to recover a degree of happiness-of reverence and revelry-in a largely unhappy world. While his abrupt shifts between different times and different places have disturbed some readers, he speaks to us with all the intelligence of one of Shakespeare's wise fools. He has suffered historical and private "dark nights of the soul" with his wits intact. Although he humbly identifies with lowly apprentices and bungling initiates, in the end his good sense, spiri- tual insight, and prodigious inventiveness make him one of contemporary poetry's masters.
