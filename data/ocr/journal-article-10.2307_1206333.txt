Clearly and concisely describing the religious system of the Greeks from the ar- chaic period in eighth century B.C.E. to the fifth century C.E. is the aim-and the striking accomplishment-of Simon Price in this most recent contribution to the interpretation of ancient religions. Although he does not provide a definition of 329</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion "system," he deploys the term to explain connections between places, practices, and ideas that vary greatly from locale to locale yet are elements in an embracing Panhellenic framework. The main categories Price uses to explain archaeological and literary sources are also the chapter titles. The first chapter, "Gods, Myths, and Festivals," displays the primary traits of the system in which a multiplicity of deities, male and female, compose a religious sphere of the culture intertwined with public and private life, without "sacred books, religious dogma or orthodoxy, but rather common practices, competing interpretations of events and actions, and the perception of sacrifice as a strategic device open to manipulation" (p. 3). Next is "Religious Places," consisting of temples as dwelling places of the deities that made and de- fined particular space as sacred, altars whose prayers and sacrifices were the focus of exchanges between humans and deities, statues that provided anthropomor- phic representations of the gods, and processions that portrayed relations be- tween civic and sacred space. In "Authority, Control and Crisis," Price discusses religious officials and oracles in the context of political life as guidelines for proper performance as well as protection against actions and beliefs that threat- ened the gods and the city, as exemplified by trials for the profanation of the Eleusinian mysteries and for Socratic ideas. "Girls and Boys, Women and Men" shows connections between general society and particular religious places and acts-transitions from stage to stage in the lives of females and males and particu- larly the rituals and beliefs about death and an afterlife. "Elective Cults" focuses on practices that diverge from official religious activities that characterized Greek city life by offering citizens choices, as Dionysiac experience and the Eleusinian, Epidaurian, Samothracian, and Orphic cults demonstrate. "Greek Thinkers" focuses on "philosophers and others, who distanced them- selves from mythology and theology [of Homer and Hesiod] in favour of their own articulate views of the world" (p. 126); Xenophanes raised moral issues, Plato critiqued religion and mythology, and Aristotle developed a functional approach to traditional anthropomorphism. Price shows how a separation between reli- gious and naturalistic explanations of the world and human society influenced later writers such as Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and Polybius, who tended to reduce the role and importance of the gods in human society. "Reactions to Greek Religions" covers Romans, who saw correspondences between Greek religion and their own and even imitated Greek models, although the two peoples differed significantly regarding temples and forms of religious authority, as well as Jews and Christians, who also recognized the antiquity and value of Greek cults and thus defended themselves against Greek charges of novelty but also considered some Greek ideas as prefigurations of their own doctrines. Price thus shows that although Jews and Christians did engage in polemics against the Greeks, they also appreciated aspects of Greek culture. The Christian emperor Constantine initiated a new development by ending the persecution of Christians and, in keeping with Greek forms of authority, began subsidizing the Christian church; he also banned divination and sacrifices. Soon, Christians began to use Greek temples, Price shows, and by the sixth century c.E., the empire was "fully Chris- tian" (p. 171), even though some Greek practices continued into the ninth cen- tury. An "Appendix of Greek Inscriptions in Translation" provides initial access to one type of source material and an invitation to further investigation. Price gives a brief bibliographical essay that characterizes several approaches to the study of ancient religions, most useful of which are Walter Burkert's Greek Religion (Cambridge, Mass., 1985), Louise Bruit Zaidman and Pauline Schmitt 330</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Pantel's Religion in the Ancient Greek City (New York, 1989), and Jan Bremmer's Greek Religion (New York, 1994). Price's own method is to attend to specific places, activities, and thinkers as they are relevant to his central focus on religious fea- tures of Greek culture as they comprise a system. He does not, as a consequence, offer a big theory or even a little one, but he does plant interpretive problems in the mind of readers that will stimulate further thought and research when he shows that Greek religion did not cease with Constantine; that Christians and Jews both admired and feared Greek cults; that because the demarcations be- tween society and religion were indistinct and porous, we can connect materials often thought disparate; that the absence of dogmas in ancient Greece did not make the Greeks tolerant and without authorities, and that Greek religion was "embedded in all aspects of ancient life" (p. 89).
