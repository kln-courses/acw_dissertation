<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Melek Ortabasi (Re)animating Folklore Raccoon Dogs, Foxes, and Other Supernatural  Japanese Citizens in Takahata Isao’s Heisei  tanuki gassen pompoko One day long ago, a lord on the island of Shikoku found two identical-looking  women sitting in his house, each claiming to be his wife. A doctor speculated  that some ailment had caused the wife’s spirit to separate into two. Even so,  chanting Buddhist prayers did not resolve the problem. Deciding to imprison  the women for the time being, the lord noticed that one of them did not like  ordinary food. Subjecting this woman to torture, he found that she was, in  fact, a fox, or kitsune. As he was about to kill the animal, however, a huge  crowd of people—thousands of them, including Buddhist priests—gathered at  his gate. “We are the foxes of the whole of Shikoku, who come to you with a  request,” they said. “The fox who has done you a wrong is . . . Osagitsune . . .  a messenger of [the rice god] Inari, and the King of the Foxes in Japan. If you  do him harm, there will come great calamity upon the country. He is our  teacher of haunting, and if he dies, we cannot haunt any longer. Please spare  his life!” The lord agreed, but with one condition: that all the foxes leave  Shikoku forever. Leaving behind a signed written oath, the animals all departed  by boat, and since that time there have been no foxes in Shikoku.1 This tale from an eighteenth-century text encapsulates several key aspects of  the extensive Japanese folklore surrounding the fox and other kindred animals,  such as the tanuki, or raccoon dog.2 Most striking is these animals’ ability to  impersonate human beings, considered a haunting. Such animals use this ability  to trick humans or to add weight to an important request, as in this tale, or for a  variety of other reasons, such as to become a Buddhist monk or to make a visit to  the doctor!3 Clearly, the human characters seem to fear this haunting, responding  Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 27, No. 2 (2013), pp. 254–275.

Defining themselves in terms of their magical abilities, animals in such tales often  remind the humans of the spiritual power they have over them, even as the  humans assert their own dominance in the physical realm. In the end, however,  as this story and many others seem to imply, the supernatural is revealed as  animal trickery, and clear distinctions between the species are preserved. Although tales like that of the Shikoku lord seem to perform a sort of purifi- cation ritual in which humans successfully eliminate species confusion, the fact  that the animals have a culture of their own speaks to fundamental conflicts  within human identity. Animals in oral and written literature have long served as  objectified others on which to project the fears and desires of the human self,  much as racial others have functioned in imperialist narratives.5 In contrast to the  interracial power play that characterizes imperial and postcolonial literature,  however, the relationships between humans and animals in folktales cannot  address a combined audience of colonizer and colonized. Because they cannot  write or talk back, animals enact the role of the other in a more extreme fashion  than the colonized. In effect, the distinct culture that the animals represent is  really a space within which humans can inscribe their own questions about iden- tity. This externalized exploration of interiority is particularly prominent in fox  and raccoon dog tales, because so much of their appeal resides in the exposure of  these transgressive others who can—and do—challenge the boundaries of the  human self. Takahata Isao’s 1994 animated film Heisei tanuki gassen pompoko (Tanuki  Battle of the Heisei Era, hereafter Pompoko) accesses, updates, and greatly extrapo- lates the fox and raccoon dog folktale tradition and the inhering crisis within  modern Japanese society as it relates to both the environment and a homoge- neous notion of Japanese identity. Pompoko is the story of a band of tanuki who, in  the late 1960s, unsuccessfully seek to stop the construction of a suburban hous- ing development in their home, the very real Tama Hills (southwest of Tokyo).  Driven to desperation by the growing lack of food and territory, the usually fun- loving tanuki decide they need an organized plan of attack. The leaders of the  group invite “great masters” from other parts of the country to harness and refine  the transformation skills of the entire tanuki community. Using their magical abili- ties to trick, bluff, cajole, terrify, and otherwise dissuade the humans from building  the project, resulting in some human casualties, the animals continue to bicker  among themselves about whether their war is aggressive or persuasive.  Yet construction continues, even when the tanuki launch their greatest magical  255 MT_27.2_06.indd   255 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> MELEK ORTABASI effort, Operation Yōkai, a massive ghost parade. This peaceful but impressive  display of the supernatural reveals itself to be simply a fun spectacle for the human  spectators, and the tanuki must ultimately admit defeat. After consulting with a  group of foxes who have successfully abandoned the forest and integrated them- selves into human life, many of the tanuki conclude that they too must use their  transformational skills to become human and live their lives out that way. Those  who cannot must remain animals who continue to battle against human encroach- ment on their habitat. Produced by the esteemed Studio Ghibli, Pompoko was both popular and  critically acclaimed in Japan; it beat out all domestic films and Disney’s Lion King  for top box office honors (Schilling, Encyclopedia, 144) and became Japan’s nomi- nation for that year’s Oscar for best foreign film (Patten 281). Reviewers have  pointed out that the film did not translate well in the overseas market, however,  possibly because of the story’s preoccupation with a local rather than a cross- cultural folkloric tradition.6 Non-Japanese critics have even chastised Pompoko for  its domestic popular appeal, pointing to the film’s “eco-moralizing” (Schilling,  Contemporary Film, 202) and to the “nostalgic element” created by the film’s  romantic view of Japan’s rural and agricultural past (Cavallaro, Animé Art, 109).  Takahata’s homage to traditional tales in a context of contemporary concerns,  however, paints anything but a simple picture of postmodern Japanese identity. A “functionalist” argument that ascribes Pompoko’s domestic success to  its “appeal to traditional narrative patternings” would assume that the film  simply “played itself out for a cultural audience that needed to see its own  self-perceptions reified” (Koven 181–82). In some senses this is true:  Pompoko is one of many films since the 1960s that have used yōkai (monsters  or supernatural beings) to represent familiar “native heroes” who can reas- suringly rectify the wrongs of actual history, rather than “outsiders,” who  pose a threat to the nation (Papp 233–34). As Zília Papp has argued,  however, yōkai have an ambiguous status “on the borderline between the  familiar (uchi) and the outside world (soto) in Japanese visual narra- tives” (236), making them profoundly fluid as visual symbols. Although  their “core feature” is their adaptability to each new ideological context  (238), a film like Pompoko shows that the malleability of such yōkai as foxes  and raccoon dogs allows them to be subversive and uncanny as well. Although animal yōkai have frequently been used in the service of nationalis- tic, self-reassuring narratives, their sheer mutability also indicates a potential to  “explode the myths of cultural stability and order” on which Japan and other  nations “have conventionally depended for the purposes of self-legitimation and  self-perpetuation” (Cavallaro, Fairy Tale, 50). This is indeed the case of Pompoko.  The tanuki and kitsune in the film do not just represent an updating of their  historical “folk” selves; their bodies actually evolve to become sites of  256 MT_27.2_06.indd   256 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> (RE)ANIMATING FOLKLORE phantasmagoric spectacle and constant, unpredictable change, allowing Takahata  to critically explore issues relevant to contemporary Japanese society. In their bid  to drive the humans out of their shrinking habitat, the tanuki work with their  elders to develop their haunting skills to the level where they can assume, literally,  any shape to suit any context. Thus even though the animals in Pompoko no  longer have the cultural authority to negotiate directly with humans, as they did  in the folkloric tradition, the film is obsessed with their ability to transform,  attributing to the animals far greater powers—and more interaction with human  society—than this tradition ever did. Rather than remaining a simple reconfirma- tion of nostalgic national flavor, the symbolic and physical instability of the  animal characters in Pompoko also registers as a subversive form of anxiety and  potential resistance. In contrast to tanuki and kitsune lore, the film uses the animals’ mutability to  break down the species distinction that folktales usually seek to maintain. Unlike  the story of the kitsune and the Shikoku lord, the defeated animals in Pompoko are  not exactly driven out. Although those who are unable or unwilling to coexist  with humans leave on a boat, just as in the older tale,7 or else live a precarious life  in close proximity with humans, those able and willing to adapt or transform  become incorporated into human society by living out their lives as humans. This  sublimation of the other within the self is elegiac only if we interpret the animals  in Pompoko as static folkloric symbols embodying traditional ways of Japanese life  that have literally been buried in the effort to modernize and industrialize.  I would argue instead that the film’s dynamically transforming animals are more  interesting as a distorted example of what animation scholar Thomas LaMarre has  called “speciesism,” or the “displacement of race and racism (relations between  humans as imagined in racial terms) onto relations between humans and animals”  (“Speciesism I,” 76). LaMarre suggests that speciesism in the postwar animated  films he examines “strives to overcome racist segregations by evoking multispe- cies cooperation” (“Speciesism II,” 72). Pompoko’s unstable multispecies landscape  is less reassuring; instead of working out the problems of a contemporary, multi- racial Japan, it struggles instead to express the collapse of a supposedly  homogeneous Japanese cultural identity at war with its own idealized past. This destabilization of the distinction between animals and humans is made  possible by Pompoko’s exploitation of the animation medium, which makes visi- ble what folk narrative and earlier visual art featuring foxes and raccoon dogs  could only suggest. Folktales in particular have tended to focus primarily on the  confusion, surprise, fear, or anger experienced by human victims of tanuki and  kitsune magic rather than on the magic itself. The tale of the Shikoku lord is like  many others in that it is silent about the actual moment in which the woman  transforms back into a fox under the duress of torture.8 Although the lord  witnesses the (undoubtedly) grotesque scene, the narrative chooses to gloss over  257 MT_27.2_06.indd   257 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> MELEK ORTABASI it, favoring instead a conclusion that highlights his clemency and authority. In  many tales the animals’ magic working is further obscured by being consigned  to the realm of hearsay; although the animal’s death precipitates its return to  animal form, the transformational moment is not witnessed by any characters in  the story.9 Sometimes, the animal’s physical transformation is not even necessary  to the story, as in cases where both foxes and raccoon dogs appear in human  form in people’s dreams.10 Finally, the mystery of transformation could simply  take the form of a human being who suddenly claims or seems to be possessed  by a kitsune or tanuki without actually changing shape.11 Owing to the intrinsic advantages of visual media, images from the Edo  period (c. 1603–1868) onward gravitated toward focusing on the transfor- mation of the animals in fox and raccoon dog narratives, a transformation  that previously tended not to be represented textually.12 The humorous  grotesqueries that resulted highlight from a new angle the lore’s ongoing  preoccupation with the porous boundaries of human identity. Woodblock  artists such as Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) created comical vignettes  featuring humanoid tanuki performing everyday tasks, suggesting that the  animals secretly lived double lives (fig. 1). Kuniyoshi’s well-worn style of  personifying animals, while suggestive of the animals’ supernatural abilities,  has more disturbing visual counterparts that speculate overtly on the  animals’ apparent desire to insinuate themselves into human life. Capturing  the ambiguous moment of transformation itself, Toriyama Sekien’s (1712– 1788) image of a mujina (or tanuki)13 sitting at the hearth in half-human,  half-animal form is oddly voyeuristic and vaguely unsettling; the viewer has  caught the animal off guard, but how long has he been fooling others in the  house (fig. 2)? Other images reveal unexpected secrets by adopting precisely  the sort of trickery attributed to tanuki and kitsune themselves. The well- known kage’e (shadow picture) depicted in Figure 3, by Kuniyoshi, reveals  the sinister and otherworldly truth that apparently lurks behind a common,  easily identifiable object. These visual gags may be droll in attitude, but  Fig. 1. “Tanuki no kanban,” one of a series of comic woodblock prints ca. 1842, by  Utagawa Kuniyoshi.

For Pompoko Takahata draws on the humorous, sly, and somewhat  grotesque flavor of these earlier visual representations, invoking and build- ing on the strategies they introduced. Extrapolating the proposition implicit  in the static scenes offered by his predecessors, Takahata makes the animals’  mutability central to the film’s plot, exposing every detail of their  259 MT_27.2_06.indd   259 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> MELEK ORTABASI Fig. 3.

This evolved aestheti- cization and narrative expansion on what had previously been limited to a  fleeting (or hidden) moment has two seemingly contradictory effects.  Although the tanuki’s fully animated, repeat performances of transformation  in the film normalize the strange and unexplained for viewers, inuring them  to surprise and shock, they simultaneously demonstrate the uncanny affin- ity between the animals’ old-fashioned talents and a technocultural tool:  animation itself. Even if the animals cannot win their real-world fight  against deforestation, by transplanting them to this new visual habitat,  Pompoko lets these folk creatures acquire the fully transgressive symbolic  potential that older media could not provide. Like their forebears in folk narrative, Pompoko’s animal protagonists  take care not to appear as themselves in front of diegetic humans—but they  are always on view to the audience. This narrative perspective puts consid- erable demand on the film to fill in the lacunae left by folk narrative, which  it does by setting visually evolved tanuki and kitsune loose in an animated  landscape to which they are clearly native. By this I mean that Pompoko’s  animals adhere primarily to the laws of animation rather than to those of  nature (or even folklore). This makes them fundamentally different from the  tanuki characters in the wildly popular live-action tanuki goten (raccoon  palace) musicals of the 1950s, played by human actors who display few  animal characteristics (figs. 4–6).14 260 MT_27.2_06.indd   260 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> (RE)ANIMATING FOLKLORE Figs. 4 &amp; 5. The tanuki characters Okuro (Wakao Ayako) and her father Doroemon  (Sugai Ichirō) in Hatsuharu tanuki goten (Spring at the tanuki palace, 1959). While  Doroemon has his tanuki makeup on when we first see him (top), he spends the  majority of the film as a human (bottom). Wakao, the beautiful young star, never  wears tanuki-like makeup — despite the fact that she lives in a tree hollow. In these live-action films it is assumed that viewers accept the tanuki  conceit, which is used primarily to provide an excuse for slapstick humor  and elaborate song-and-dance routines showcasing contemporary stars  more or less being themselves. By contrast, Pompoko features characters  who can literally become anyone, giving credence to LaMarre’s assertion that  “animation loves animals” by ably satisfying viewers’ “kinetophilia,” or the  “sheer delight in movement, as well as a fascination with plasticity and elas- ticity” (“Speciesism I,” 79). Indeed, the hidden tanuki and kitsune culture  takes shape in Takahata’s film primarily as an extreme ability to adapt  continually and violently according to narrative context and perspective. Because of their animation-enhanced talents, the tanuki in Pompoko, unlike  their cousins in the 1950s musicals, lack a stable visual identity.

These tanuki never take on animal forms; their  status as folklore animals is indicated only at a very basic level by their roles in the  well-worn plot also featured in Hatsuharu tanuki goten. The main attractions of this  film, which features even less trick photography than  Hatsuharu, are singing idols  Yukimura and the even more famous Misora Hibari, who appears in drag as the tanuki  prince, Tanukichirô. the opportunity for slapstick humor of a different variety15—every animal  habitually appears in at least “three primary modes of depiction: realistic,  comic and iconic” (Brophy 185). The film begins with the realistic depiction of  undifferentiated tanuki foraging for food; their appearance and behavior is least  abstracted from the actual animal (fig. 7). The comic depiction emerges peri- odically, particularly when the tanuki indulge their well-known asobigokoro  (playful spirit). In this mode too they lack individuality and, as one might  guess, display their most stereotypically folk characteristics (fig. 8). These two- dimensional modes are supplemented by an iconic mode, where the tanuki  possess agency, complex emotions, and independent will, much as would  human characters. It is in this anthropomorphic, individuated state, which is  rarely revealed to the humans in the film, that the animal characters of Pompoko  apparently prefer to spend most of their time (fig. 9). Although several visual identities for a single character are common in  manga and anime, in Pompoko this strategy for expressing the emotional state of  a character also foregrounds the multifaceted and contradictory roles the animals  play in the cultural imagination.16 A sustained dissonance governs the tanuki’s  supposedly self-generated mode switching precisely because each mode indicates  a different way in which humans conceive of the animals. At the beginning of the  film the viewer watches some realistic tanuki engaging in natural behavior, seem- ingly unaware that they are being watched. The voiceover, however, features  tanuki commenting nostalgically (in human voices) on their own behavior in the  262 MT_27.2_06.indd   262 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="10"> (RE)ANIMATING FOLKLORE Fig. 7.

The odd disjunction between the image of nonver- bal animals and the reflective, storytelling tone of the voiceover also implies that  the tanuki are somehow both subject and object. In subsequent scenes there are at least two other reasons for realistic tanuki to  appear, each of which continues to distance the audience from a conventional- ized, instrumentalist perspective of the world. When human characters are in the  scene, for example, the realistic mode is the only way in which they seem able to  perceive the animals; their blindness seems to comment on the restricted under- standing of interspecies relationships offered by contemporary scientific  knowledge. The privileged viewpoint of the audience in relation to the diegetic  humans can also increase the pathos of a situation when the tanuki characters  suddenly revert to realistic mode in the presence of humans or their technology,  unable to fully carry out or sustain their carefully laid plans (fig. 10). The rela- tively smaller bodies and nonverbal behavior they reacquire in these moments of  physical and psychic crisis certainly highlight the limits of their magic and their  helplessness in the face of human power. In this way, the realistic mode suggests  to the audience the pitfalls of equating scientific and technological omnipotence  with knowledge of the world. The realistic mode, however, best functions as a tool of defamiliariza- tion in tandem with the other two modes, which take the more personified  and culturalized forms suggested by fox and raccoon dog folklore.

Because they party and brawl  as humans do, these animals are somewhat humanized, allowing them to  act as reminders of human foibles; even in the face of imminent danger, the  tanuki foolishly opt for this unreflective, selfish mode and throw an epic  party in celebration of a small victory, or else fight pointlessly among them- selves over scarce resources. The characterization of this folklore-ordained  emotional attribute as a distinct mode, however, also codes them as subhu- man, childish beings. Their lack of self-reflexiveness in this state is indicated  not only by a caricatured, overtly two-dimensional style but also by the fact  that they take to it in great numbers at mob mentality moments. The unin- flected and predictable behavior they exhibit in this mode is further  expressed in the actual reuse, in different scenes, of the same repetitive  party sequence. In the short sequences where the tanuki take on this form,  the chaos they create is both stereotypical and harmless; drinking sake,  playing Japanese instruments, and dancing with fans, they mimic the human  realm rather than interact with it. It is telling that the last time we see the  comic tanuki is on the boat taking away those who cannot or will not join  human society (fig. 11). The flat, nostalgic conception of folklore these  comic figures represent, the scene suggests, is nothing but an obsolete motif.  Because these comic tanuki represent only a limited and literal view of tradi- tion, it is the last mode that truly adds complexity to the folkloric  perspective. Fig. 11. Absorbed in rejecting reality and in “comic” mode, the fugitive tanuki  spirits ride off on a takarabune (treasure boat), a popular religious icon associated  both with prosperity and the dispelling of bad dreams. 265 MT_27.2_06.indd   265 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> MELEK ORTABASI In their nuanced iconic form the tanuki invoke their folkloric origins in  complex ways, clearly functioning as surrogate human selves designed to  question human arrogance. Although the personification of animals often  provides humans with an interspecies metaphor for delivering self-critique,  Pompoko takes special advantage by exploiting the tanuki’s well-established  fondness for mimicking human life. The film’s iconic tanuki may still exhibit  stereotypical folk behavior, such as thumping their belly drums in a gesture of  satisfaction,17 but they possess psychologically complex and strongly individu- ated identities, living comfortably in a community governed by fundamentally  human social laws. Going far beyond the limited conceit suggested by  Kuniyoshi’s woodblock print series, these tanuki do not merely ape human  habits for humorous effect but actively seek to retain the human privilege of  raising their families in a supportive and safe society. The competing desires of humans and iconic tanuki recall the logic of  speciesism: Pompoko’s humans enact the familiar metaphor of one race  depriving another less powerful race of the human rights they all deserve.  This clichéd, dualistic model is effective enough in delivering a transnation- ally accessible environmental message, but it fails to explain another type of  logic that governs the tanuki-human allegory. Like the best literary doppel- ganger, the tanuki in this mode are not only ventriloquists for human guilt  but also uncanny externalizations of humanity that “[challenge] the location  of the [human] self in a coherent and singular body” (Cuthbert 226). Unlike  the doubles of modern literature, however, the tanuki of Pompoko are not  shadow selves for particular human individuals; they are projections of a  more general psychological crisis brought on by modern media culture. In  folklore tanuki and kitsune have long provided psychological services for  humans; they were the explanation for strange, unfathomable human  behavior outside social norms. Pompoko, which is self-consciously more  ambitious and deals with a different zeitgeist, instead uses the iconic tanuki  and their ability to embody human anxiety to show that an attachment to  technology has blinded humans to anything that the modern media  cannot explain. This human inability to see is a mass psychological phenomenon,  apparent in the fact that the entire neighborhood is amazed and entertained  by the spectacular and otherworldly ghost parade that is the centerpiece of  the tanuki’s war on the humans; the residents are satisfied with the unlikely  explanation that the parade was simply a promotional event for a new  amusement park (fig. 12).18 Despite the effort expended, which results in  the death of Inugami (one of the elders), the tanuki’s grand performance  fails to draw a deep psychological response from its audience.

Even though the monsters  cavorting among the apartment blocks of Tama Hills is the most memorable  sequence in the film, Pompoko nevertheless seems uncomfortable with a role  where it celebrates tanuki lore by simply providing a pleasurable spectacle  for passive human consumption. Instead, in a truly ironic and self-reflexive moment, the film has the tanuki  realize the role that the modern mass media has played in managing and  controlling human vision. Making a last attempt to return from repression, the  animals send a letter through the postal service asking for a television inter- view to tell their side of the story. Perhaps humans will see them if they appear  on a recognized media outlet. A television crew takes the bait, arriving in the  forest with cameras and microphones in the manner of a campy reality show  about ghost hunting. Hiding out of view in their iconic form, tanuki speak in  human voices from behind the bushes, but this fails to satisfy the truth-seeking  reporter. Singing a children’s folk song, he attempts to lure the tanuki out of  hiding, saying that they must perform their transformation skills on camera or  “this show is going to look like a bad joke.” Driven to desperate measures, two  of the most senior tanuki summon their courage and appear before the humans  in their iconic form (fig. 13). “We’re the ones who put on the ghost parade. . ..

An indignant and righteous Granny Oroku, with Abbot Tsurugame on her  shoulders, confronts the reporters and TV cameras. the only one in which humans and tanuki in their most anthropomorphized  mode have a real conversation. The humans’ intense affective response during this brief exchange  suggests that the tanuki’s mutability provides an important commentary on  contemporary human subjectivity. Although the reporter tells the hidden  tanuki that he “shares their point of view,” the fact is that he cannot. He  expresses surprise and excitement when the animals show themselves in  realistic form, but his demeanor changes dramatically when the iconic  tanuki suddenly appear. In the moment after Granny Oroku speaks to the  trembling reporter, she demonstrates her abilities by transforming from her  iconic form into a huge, fierce bear. This performance causes the reporter  and his cameraman, who are clearly just as terrified as the tanuki, to sponta- neously lose consciousness, apparently mentally unable to process precisely  the truth they were seeking. The typical defense mechanism the reporter  and his cameraman display suggests an obvious diagnosis: confronted with  a classic doppelganger “appear[ing] out of place in order to displace [the]  host,” the humans are unable to assimilate or accept the palpable threat that  the iconic animals and their transformational skills represent to their power- ful self-image (Webber 4).19 The humans soon recover from their insensible  state, but significantly, the tanuki have already assumed more “proper” forms  as nonthreatening, realistic forest animals (fig. 14). We already know that  nothing will remain on videotape, because modern technology, unlike folk- lore, cannot detect when the human subject has become “split into two.”  Or can it? 268 MT_27.2_06.indd   268 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="16"> (RE)ANIMATING FOLKLORE Fig. 14. The reporter and his cameraman wake up to find themselves surrounded  by a variety of transformed tanuki, who have taken the shape of realistic woodland  animals. Not content with providing spectacle alone, Pompoko uses animation  itself to rework the psychological phenomenon manifested in premodern fox  and raccoon dog lore for Japan’s postmodernity. The tanuki act as doubles of  today’s Japanese through their radical ability to transform themselves and  their surroundings, an attribute that enabled the nation’s rapid reinvention of  itself in the modern age. Destabilizing the traditional image of the tanuki even  further, Pompoko’s animals finally exist perpetually between forms, because  the final measure the animals take to survive means living double (or triple)  lives as humans and tanuki in their realistic and iconic forms. Unlike in  Japanese folk tradition or in doppelganger literature, Pompoko’s animals do  not function as catch-all explanations for the weird and unexplained or as  unsuccessfully suppressed aspects of humanity. By both collapsing and reify- ing the boundary between human and animal, the film insinuates instead that  the tanuki act as must today’s Japanese: adapt to a rapidly changing world, or  be eliminated. The mimicry of the tanuki in Pompoko, as in folklore, therefore points back  at humans—but in this case to argue that contemporary Japanese are largely  unaware of the unnatural, ongoing self-transformation they have brought  upon themselves in the process of embracing modernity. On many occasions  the tanuki express horror at human encroachment on nature, made possible by  the acquisition of powers greater and much more dangerous than the tanuki’s.  In a deeply ironic commentary on the humans in the film, who do not reflect  on their own technological prowess, one of the animals surveys in horror the  entire city that has gone up during his three-year absence: “Humans did this?!  269 MT_27.2_06.indd   269 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="17"> MELEK ORTABASI No, it’s only tanuki who can do this kind of thing!” The misguided humans in  the film instead direct their fear elsewhere, at the supposed incommensurabil- ity of tanuki transformation with natural laws. For example, the reporter and  his cameraman are clearly fascinated but terrified by the idea that an intelli- gent, verbal being can shed its identity and transform itself beyond recognition  in little more than an instant. But they do not recognize themselves as modern  Japanese in that metaphor, at least not consciously. Scholars of the posthuman have thoroughly discussed the link between  science fiction and the psychological pressure exercised by modernity; the  genre’s closeted relation with the past has been less discussed. Yet science  fiction is a futuristic cousin to folklore, where human fears and desires take the  shape of cyborgs, sentient robots, and other forms of hybrid life. Replacing the  yōkai doubles of folklore with such technologized creatures, science fiction  works through the dilemmas of a new age by “often draw[ing] on ‘premodern’  models, in which human beings are defined not simply by their status as  active, controlling subjects, but by their connection to and participation in a  world of ‘other’ forces and agencies” (Rutsky 19). Japanese science fiction  anime, in particular, is well-known for visually exploring in literal fashion the  idea that this “‘cyborg subject position’ is not stable, but mutational” (Rutsky  19), graphically depicting human-machine-alien interfaces that lead to physi- cally transformed, hybrid life forms.20 Where science fiction fetishizes the  blending of the human body with technology—the symbiotic relationship  between the humans and their giant robot EVAs in Evangelion or even the ritu- alistic bodily transformation featured in Sailor Moon come to mind—Pompoko  also uses this pervasive anime-ic trope to suggest that human consciousness is  limited but potentially mutable.21 Exploring the future of Japanese identity with more rustic materials,  Pompoko thus reverse-engineers its folk animals, endowing them with the  visual, dynamic characteristics native to animated science fiction so that they  can seamlessly and credibly convert into humans whose location as subjects is  clearly in question. Although Mark Schilling remarks only in passing that  Pompoko has “more morphing than in ten Power Rangers episodes put together”  (Schilling, Encyclopedia, 144), a comparison between Takahata’s film and a  conventional science fiction anime television series is more apt than it may  seem. Shape shifting is often coded as pre- or even antitechnological magic,  but Pompoko reinvents the tanuki’s innate compulsion to become human by  embracing “animation’s lack of a more photographic relation to the physical  and material forces of gravity, light, bodily weight and depth” (Looser 317–18).  Certainly Pompoko, like most Studio Ghibli films, presents a largely cinematic,  organic world,22 but when the tanuki morph into humans, the effect is not  270 MT_27.2_06.indd   270 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="18"> (RE)ANIMATING FOLKLORE Fig. 15.

Incrementally transforming into people who are  clearly based on their iconic versions, the tanuki become indistinguishable  from the other humans in the film; at the same time they remain avatarlike,  wearing a metaphorical disguise. Preserving a measure of autonomy from humans through this visual  transformative metaphor, the tanuki of Pompoko therefore become more  than a symbol of fading human beliefs in the supernatural. Repressed and  yet present as a fluctuating foreign presence in contemporary Japan, the  tanuki in Takahata’s film introduce a unique sort of diversity and mutability  into a society that still considers itself largely homogeneous. Although this  is not the same as the science fiction anime that “valoriz[e] the constant  emergence of variation as the truly definitive condition of human life and  identity” (Looser 314), Pompoko is nevertheless a nationalized proposal for  “posthumanism,” or “the acknowledgement and activation of the trace of  the inhuman within the human” (Badmington 157). It seems that the  repressed does always return and that its relationship with technology is  not always adversarial. Collapsing the distinction between species that  much folklore insists on, Pompoko presents an unusual sort of postmodern  doppelganger who deploys its own agency in order to invisibly rejoin an  unaware self. And yet this reunion between animal and human is anything but invis- ible, because the film purposely takes the audience into its confidence.  Unlike the diegetic humans, we know that the tanuki have literally become  271 MT_27.2_06.indd   271 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="19"> MELEK ORTABASI a submerged and dispersed part of the (Japanese) self. Despite Pompoko’s  comforting conclusion, where we leave the tanuki engaged in typical behav- ior—carefree partying on a golf course under a full moon—there is no real  sense of closure. In a world where humans may or may not be tanuki, what  does it really mean to “show one’s tail” (shippo o dasu), a common tanuki- inspired proverb that means to reveal one’s true character? Similarly, when  a tanuki addresses the audience directly at the end of the film, asking them  to “understand the tanuki’s point of view,” is he talking to the other or to  the self? Even though it is cute to explain the phenomenon of average  energy-drink-consuming salarymen as exhausted tanuki in need of a boost  (fig. 16), the composite identity implied by the numerous images of tanuki  men and women near the end of the film does not signify a reconfirmation  of a stable ethnic or cultural identity. Rather, it implies that things have to  change on the inside—and that they already have. This is why Pompoko’s  rewriting of premodern tanuki lore through sustained sourcing, transplan- tation, and transformation of familiar iconography is not simply an  updating but ultimately a deconstruction of postmodern Japanese subjec- tivity. Using the animal other to explore the self, Pompoko’s distinctive use  of animated speciesism results in a film that “assuage[s] . . . [the] racial  anxieties” brought about by Westernization and modernization even as it  lets the Japanese viewer “imagine other worlds of difference” (LaMarre,  “Speciesism I,” 92). Sometimes one’s own past is where the most compel- ling models for imagining difference can be found. Fig. 16. Two tired salarymen who stop to pick up an energy drink glance at each  other—and have the unspoken mutual realization that they are both actually trans- formed tanuki. 272 MT_27.2_06.indd   272 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="20"> (RE)ANIMATING FOLKLORE Notes 1. Paraphrased and quoted from M. W. De Visser, who summarizes the late- seventeenth-century Honchō koji inenshū (Collection of Old Tales of Karmic  Fate in Our Country), (67–68). 2. Michael Foster notes that “the kitsune and tanuki together have become indelibly  linked with mysterious phenomena, and the combined reading of the Sinicized  pronunciations of their graphs, kori, has come to signify all manner of weird  occurrences” (36). 3. M. W. De Visser mentions a medieval kyōgen play titled Kitsune in which a fox  takes the shape of a Buddhist monk to warn a hunter “that it is very bad to catch  and kill foxes” (69). De Visser also paraphrases a tale from Kyokutei Bakin’s Enseki  zasshi (Swallowstone Miscellany, 1810) in which a tanuki named Danzaburō  seeks treatment from a human physician (85). 4. Although the perpetrator often feels the animal’s revenge in the form of illness,  insanity, or even death, this is not always the case. For example, a hunter who  shoots a tanuki that was posing as a bodhisattva suffers no misfortune. This  story appears in similar form in the Konjaku monogatari shū (Tales of Times  Now Past, twelfth century) and Uji shūi monogatari (A Collection of Tales from  Uji, thirteenth century), both collections of setsuwa, short miscellaneous tales  (Fujimoto 13). 5. For example, R. Keller Kimbrough points out that animals played the roles of  demonized or abjected others in late medieval Japanese Buddhist thought.  Whether they acted as symbols of human shortcomings or represented weaker  entities in need of protection, they occupied an inferior position. On the one  hand, “animal-realm rebirth [was] the punishment for ‘the stupid and the  shameless’” (182). On the other hand, descriptions or depictions of humans  being tortured by animals in hell acted as “pronouncements against cruelty to  farm animals” (189). 6. Studio Ghibli films are known for their refiguring of folklore, but Takahata’s  more famous compatriot Miyazaki Hayao has been more successful interna- tionally. Michael Foster speculates that it is “perhaps the eclectic nature of  Miyazaki’s characters . . . that enables them to negotiate national borders with  such success” (257). 7. The film makes the metaphor of the departure more explicit than in the older  tale: the tanuki who leave on the boat are actually dead, having purposely sacri- ficed themselves to the cause; it is really only their spiritual selves who are depart- ing for a better place. 8. The idea that that transformation is taxing for these animals is a well-established  part of fox and raccoon dog folklore; death or physical stress always causes a  transformed animal to reveal itself. 9. Foster translates a brief story from Shokoku hyaku monogatari (Hyaku Monogatari  of the Various Provinces, 1677) in which a samurai kills a tanuki who poses as his  dead wife. When he stabs her, the woman “disappear[s] into thin air”; the next  day, a dead tanuki is found in “a hole in a grove located at the northwest corner of  the property” (53–54). 10. De Visser relates a tale from Hotta Bakusui’s Sanshū kidan (Strange Tales from  the Sanshū Region, 1764) in which a fox rewards a hunter for sparing her life  273 MT_27.2_06.indd   273 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="21"> MELEK ORTABASI by appearing as a woman in his dream and sharing a secret that will make him  rich (75). 11. In some regions of Japan during the Meiji period (1868–1912), it was still  believed that fox possession could be cured by forcing the animal to leave the  human’s body. The departure was not apparent, however, apart from the fact that  the patient would speak for the animal and simply fall unconscious once the fox  invisibly departed through a window (De Visser 75). 12. For a fairly detailed historical catalog of premodern and modern visual art  featuring tanuki, see Schumacher. 13. Commenting on the power of folklore to affect knowledge, folk studies scholar  Yanagita Kunio (1875–1962) makes the point that regional nomenclature often  differentiates between the tanuki and the mujina, even though biologists insist  that they are one and the same animal (477). 14. The Japanese Movie Database (http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/) lists no fewer than  sixty-five movies that include the word tanuki in their titles, the earliest from  1914. Perusing this list chronologically reveals a concentration of tanuki musi- cals in the 1950s. 15. The senior tanuki start a sort of shape-shifting boot camp, where the viewer is  treated to a number of funny images of training tanuki who, despite their best  efforts, can only partially transform themselves. 16. Interestingly, Brophy argues that it is this potentially disorienting feature of the  film, rather than its focus on native Japanese folklore, that “mak[es] it a film for  the adventurous gaijin (foreigner)” only (185). 17. According to many folktales and songs, tanuki like to use their prominent bellies  as drums. One of the sounds they make is “pompoko.” 18. The tanuki’s ghost parade is a live performance of a popular motif in premodern  visual art: the hyakkiyagyō (procession of 100 demons). The tanuki, not realizing  that modern humans have become largely immune to such spectacles, hope  thereby to convince their audience that the new town is haunted. 19. The term doppelganger was originally defined in a literary context as “Leute, die sich  selber sehen” (people who see themselves). “From the start, it seems that the subject  may not so much have as be the Doppelgänger by seeing itself,” an insight that speaks  to the divided subject this device has so often been used to signify (Webber 3). 20. Classic examples include Kōkaku kidōtai (Ghost in the Shell, 1995), in which the  character Kusanagi, already a cyborg, further merges with the Puppet Master, a  disembodied, computerized life form. Akira (1988) presents a similar example;  the character Tetsuo willingly allows himself to merge with or be taken over by  Akira, another disembodied life-form created by humans themselves. 21. Thomas Looser, who coined the term anime-ic, uses it primarily to frame the  relationship between visual media and contemporary “conditions of experi- ence” rather than to describe a set of techniques specific to anime (300).  Nevertheless, he identifies certain characteristics of anime, such as its “imma- teriality and flatness,” that, he argues, act as indicators of a postmodern shift in  subjectivity and perspective (318). 22. Looser argues that Takahata’s colleague Miyazaki Hayao in fact uses “anime-ic  techniques to critique and refute the structures of anime, in favor of the   cinematic” (319). 274 MT_27.2_06.indd   274 08/10/13   1:16 AM </page> <page sequence="22"> (RE)ANIMATING FOLKLORE Works Cited Badmington, Neil.
