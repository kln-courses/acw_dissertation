<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Political Pluralism. A Study of Modern Political Theory. K. C. HsiAo. (International Library of Psychology, Philosophy, and Scientific Method.) New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., Inc. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd. 1927. Pp. viii + 271. This book is a systematic criticism of political pluralism from the point of view of Hegelian idealism. As such, it is well executed. That one should defend an alien tradition in an alien tongue so subtly and engagingly as does Professor Hsiao is remarkable. Indeed, it is no inconsiderable feat. Furthermore, the book is not only well written, but it is mechanically as perfect as the fate which governs printing and proof-reading will allow. The present writer noticed but three typographical errors. The first two chapters discuss "Pluralism and Law." The the- ories of Duguit and Krabbe, then of Gierke, Laski, Cole, and the Webbs, are reviewed under the subtitles of Legal Theory, Constitu- tional Law and International Law. The third chapter takes -up functional representation in representative government, specifically in relation to the composition of the electorate, of the legislative as- sembly and of the parties in a state. The next chapter briefly ad- verts to the administrative decentralization program of French syn- dicalists. Chapter Five considers the problem of the relation of economics and politics with especial reference to Hobson and Cole. The two following chapters criticize the position of pluralism in reference to sovereignty, the doctrine of the common will, and the question of change and stability in political organization. Chapter Eight is an attack on the "philosophical background" of pluralism, i.e., the radical empiricism of James. Chapter Nine is an effort to</page><page sequence="2">384 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY restate the idealistic doctrine of "the state as an ethical ideal," and the concluding chapter summarizes historical movements in political theory, again emphasizing the point that Hegel was right. Indeed, one is tempted to say that the whole moral of Professor Hsiao 's story is just that: Hegel was right! All the pluralists, in his opinion, turn out to be more monistic than they popularly are thought to be. Duguit is a monist (p. 16); Krabbe also turns out to be monistic in his position (p. 31). After discussing Cole, Laski, and the Webbs, our author says, "we may still remain political monists" (p. 77) and yet accept functional representation. As re- gards the syndicalists "so long as an ultimate delegating authority is not denied . . . we are still adherents of the traditional monistic theory of the state and sovereignty" (p. 97 f.). "Whatever may be the avenue of approach . . . the final outcome of the pluralistic argument is, in every instance, not multiplicity as such . . . but some unity that transcends and points beyond mere multiplicity" (p. 127). Again, "when pluralism sets out to prove that there is no ultimate authority in society, and that there should not be such authority, it proposes a task which cannot be accomplished" (p. 139). This monistic emphasis is characteristic of the book, once emerging as a statement of faith in a political class-of-all-classes, even though it does not exist. " Ought we not to endeavor . . . to bring unity nearer to us?" asks our author; "even if unity is an ever- receding goal, our social prospect would become brighter by striving toward it than by remaining in a state of pluralistic incoherence" (p. 174). Professor Hsiao then attacks the pragmatism of James. This, he says, is a sort of "cosmic republicanism" -a carrying of self- government into metaphysics, and is "by far the most audacious piece of anthropomorphism ever attempted in modern philosophy" (p. 193). Again, ironically, "The Absolute-Bastille shattered; the all-absorbing monarchical God dethroned; liberty for all; Year One of the Universe Republic; inauguration of the cosmic Reign of Ter- ror, with Professor James in the role of the prophetic Rousseau and Mr. Laski as the irresistible Danton. . .." But even James, after all, was a monist! For in spite of his empiricist partisan spirit and unconscious borrowings from idealism which defeated the reconcilia- tion he desired, he anticipated vaguely the "concrete monism" which "certain idealists have attempted to develop" (p. 205). But this is only half the story of Political Pluralism. Not only do the pluralists turn out to be monists, but also, mirabile dictu, the monists turn out to be pluralists! Hobbes and Bodin were plural- ists at heart (p. 128 f.). And, although "we can and must regard sovereignty, in its theoretical totality, as supreme and unlimited,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 385 actually, of course, such a complete synthesis of the various aspects of sovereignty never exists" (p. 135). This last is a candid admission, by the author, of the fact of pluralism. But Hegel also was a pluralist. In the chapter on the state as an ethical ideal, which is a rendering of the Kulturstaat idea, Professor Hsiao says, "The pluralistic state thus understood bears a true resemblance to the monistic state as defined by the ethical philosophers, particularly by Hegel. It is probably not too far wrong to conjecture that Hegel himself would be willing to approve of the pluralistic theory in general. " Professor Hsiao is not merely an apologist. He is trying to effect a sane theory of the state by reconciling traditional doctrines. But the traditional baggage is almost too much for him. In some excel- lent passages, pp. 140-145, he skirts the edge of the real questions at issue. When he says that the pluralists have missed the "logical point of the monistic theory," he is right; the immanent dialectic of idealism is not even seriously discussed by them. They have resorted to metaphysics not for debate, but for support, and they have found it in the pluralistic emphasis. The real issues among political theorists are posed by their divergent objectives. The fun- damental problems of politics are not crucially concerned in any metaphysical problem of monism versus pluralism. As Professor Hsiao says (footnote to p. 145), "a true the-ory must be monistic as it must be pluralistic." But he does not develop the point. He might have added that all subject-matter is presented as individu- ality-in-comntinuity, and if the individuals are stressed, in any system, pluralism results. Likewise, if the continuity is emphasized, monism emerges. Politically both contemporary pluralism and monism have been logically correct in what they have asserted and incorrect in what they have denied. There is unity, and there is plurality. The opposition of the two is gratuitous; stated in their barest and most formal shape the two doctrines are truisms. The antithesis be- tween the two is not a "problem" to be "solved," but one to "get over"! Practically, however, pluralism is a number of different things. Political Pluralism points out many of the divergencies in theory. It fails to bring out, however, that the significance of their proposals, the acceptance or rejection of them, is a question involving a judg- ment of the desirability of the concrete consequences of those pro- posals. And the same is true of "monistic" proposals. All political thinkers are at bottom utilitarian, though the bottom may be well disguised. In the absence of a developed social science men will speculate and picture imaginatively what they feel ought to be. It is the business of the political philosopher to criticize these specu-</page><page sequence="4">386 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY lations-to see the bottom, so to speak, and make possible something better than mere conservatism or mere radicalism. We do not need faith, we need vision. What do the various proposals, "pluralistic" and "monistic," mean in the concrete situation? To answer that question is to import enlightenment, i.e., to make possible a choice of a course of action in terms of its consequence as weighed against the consequences of alternative policies. Looked at in this way, what is involved? Monism has stood for the national state, as in Bosanquet, in spite of its concessions, since the war, to internationalism. It is interesting that Professor Hsiao at no point discusses internationalism (excepting Krabbe's position). One would think that a good illustration of the inadequacies of a merely pluralistic method of procedure might be found on the level of international affairs in the events leading up to the World War. Does political monism mean international consolidation, or not? If it does not mean that, is it an endorsement of the irresponsible sovereign national state of the nineteenth century? The fact is that political monism is embarrassed by the catastrophe of the World War, although its adherents may talk as though they were not. The Kulturstaat idea no longer has the ring of reality, in spite of idealis- tic reaffirmations. If the idealists want to present a real alternative to political pluralism, let them stress internationalism; the primary anarchy of today is international. Adjusting mechanisms should exist in situations involving conflicting interests, and these may be pyra- mided into World Courts or world governments. Since the idealists have not done this, or done it but grudgingly, and in spite of Hegel be it noted, they tacitly stand as defenders of an "ethical ideal" which recently has led millions of men to horrible suffering and pre- mature death! The pluralists, by way of contrast, are aggressive and, in many instances, very clear-eyed as regards their objectives. Many of them agree in theory while differing in purposes. Others differ in theory although agreeing, in the main, regarding their aims. Hobson, e.g., calls the state the custodian of "spiritual" interests, while Cole would regard the present state as composed of consumers. (In criticizing the Guildsmen, Laski once humorously asked this ques- tion, "In time of war does the citizen fight as a spirituelle or as a consumptive?") The Webbs would have two parliaments, Laski one. So the overt divergencies run, though the real cleavages in purpose do not always follow the verbal contrasts. All the attacks are delivered on the sovereign national state and aim at shifting the focus of social authority within or without the nation-state in such a way as to attain the objectives of the individual or group making the attack. Figgis wanted his Church to have more power; the</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 387 French syndicalists would shift authority into the hands of the fonctionnaires. The Guildsmen seek a reordering of political struc- tures which will enhance the authority of the labor unions. Both Duguit and Krabbe have a "natural law" method-one in "solidar- ity" and the other in his "Rechtsgefill"-which in operation would enhance the position of lawyers and judges. But is it expedient to enhance the political power of labor unions? Should the Church become the custodian of morality, e.g., by assuming jurisdiction over divorce? Should legislators, territorially elected, be supreme in authority, or should lawyers and judges assume greater powers in the social order? How far can and should nationality be divorced from political structures? Should greater administrative autonomy be given the civil service? To what extent should responsibility be legally imposed? How far should political structures be held responsible morally for the 'acts of their agents? These, and a host of other questions, are posed by contemporary pluralism. Some of them are well discussed by Professor Hsiao; others remain unan- swered. The concrete questions of policy which arise in each generation must be answered by that generation. There is no mathematically precise system of politics which is true, iiberhaupt, forever. The policies which should be pursued are ascertainable only in terms of the structures which exist in the given situation. The ways in which human interests can be organized are indefinite in number and kind. Self-government must begin in the local community and be achieyed progressively at every level in political organization by every gen- eration. In any age one level of organization may demand central- ization while another needs decentralization. Our author errs, with many other political thinkers, in being a bit too doctrinaire. Po- liticcl Pluralism, however, is a very stimulating work, worthy of the careful attention of every serious student of political theory. It is the best contemporary statement of the idealistic position. PAUL W. WARD. SYACUSE UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
