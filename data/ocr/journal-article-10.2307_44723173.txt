Giovanni Coiangelo ESA/ESTEC Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT As part of the European contribution to the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS), the European Robotic Arm (ERA) is designed under contract of the European Space Agency by Fokker Space as the Prime contractor. The particularly challenging aspect of the ERA thermal design is to enable ERA operation under all possible in-orbit thermal environmental conditions which are to be experienced throughout its 10 year life. These conditions can be between extreme cold without sunlight for hibernation to extreme hot with ERA operating in full sunlight in close vicinity to a large station item, for instance, the solar arrays. First a short description of the ERA system is given with a summary of the main thermal design features. The system level thermal balance test on the ERA Engineering Qualification Model (EQM) is intended to validate the system level thermal model, which consists of the sub- system thermal models as supplied by the respective sub- contractors. In addition the thermal models of the Limbs and the Joints were validated during this test. The ERA EQM TB test has been performed at the Large Space Simulator (LSS) facilities at ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands and took about 12 days pure testing. The configuration of the test item together with the thermal adapter used in the LSS are discussed. The thermal balance test consisted of the following phases: • a hot operational test phase in which the maximum temperature levels in a hot thermal environment are obtained, • a cool down phase that verifies the time -dependent thermal behaviour of the system, • a cold hibernation phase showing the operation of the active thermal control system followed by a steady state with suppressing of thermostat switching. • a gradient test case with solar simulation where one side of ERA is illuminated and the other is exposed to a cold environment, intended to verify internal gradients. The test item was equipped with -370 thermocouples to monitor the internal and external temperatures. The test itself and the subsequent thermal model correlation activities are discussed. Conclusions and recommendations for the conducting of this type of test are highlighted. Introduction ERA is intended for use on the International Space Station (ISS) project, to service the Russian segment. Currently the Flight Model is planned to be delivered by the beginning of 2001 for a launch in the beginning of 2002. The development program is in the Flight Model assembly phase. ERA is designed to assist and whenever possible to substitute Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) which require very hazardous and difficult operations for Cosmonauts. ERA operations will first begin with the assembly of the Russian segment and then afterwards continue with the routine tasks such as inspection, maintenance, freight handling, etc. System Configuration ERA is anthropomorphic (see Figure 1). It is made of one elbow with an identical limb, wrist and end-effector on each side. One end-effector is attached on the space station to a dedicated base point. At this base point, connections enable data and video signal exchange with the space station as well as the supply of electrical power. With its free end- effector, ERA can grapple and move pay loads or EVA support platforms. With its Integrated Service Tool, ERA can also provide torque to payloads, for instance for the deployment of the solar arrays. Power can be provided to the payload through the arm. Cameras each with its 683</page><page sequence="2">illumination unit placed on the Limbs and on the wrist are used to guide the arm during its automatic motion, and to provide general overview pictures of the work-site to Cosmonauts inside the Station. Figure 1: Exploded view of ERA ERA can relocate itself from base point to base point, extending considerably its effective working volume. To enable this relocation, as indicated above, ERA has been made symmetrical with respect to the Elbow. The free end- effector grapples a new base point, and the other end- effector un-grapples from the old base point. The camera placed on the end-effector of ERA will enable automatic grappling of a base point or of a payload. In addition to its mechanical dexterity, ERA has its on- board computer which makes it autonomous and independent from space station computing resources. Mission plans will be prepared on-ground and then transferred to the ERA computer. For safety reasons, the execution of a mission will be monitored by the Cosmonauts in IVA or EVA who's role will be to confirm each step of the mission utilizing man-machine interface devices with the possibility to interrupt the mission if an unsafe situation should occur. The man machine interface will also be used for unplanned missions where ERA will be directly controlled by the Cosmonauts by selection of commands from switches, menus and if needed general-purpose mission plan sequences. ERA is divided in a number of subsystems. An important characteristic of the ERA project is that the entire design of each of these subsystems is the responsibility of a single Subcontractor. 1. The Manipulator Joint Subsystem (MJS) consists of two wrists and one elbow. Each wrist is made of 3 joints (roll, yaw and pitch) and one electronic box for their control. The elbow is made of one joint (pitch) also with its own electronic control box. 2. The End-Effector Subsystem (EES) consists of two Basic End-Effectors and the base points. Each Basic End-Effector (BEE) is equipped with: • a grapple mechanism and a torque force sensor to grapple a base point or a payload. The grapple mechanism includes video, data and power lines coupling system to the base point connectors • an integrated service tool to provide torque to payloads • electronic units for the control of the different Basic End-Effector functions 3. The Manipulator Limb Subsystem (MLS) consists of two Limbs of carbon fiber reinforced plastic material. 4. The ERA Control Computer subsystem (OBC), is the brain of the system which communicates with the space station through the external databus and with each S/S through the internal databus. 5. The Camera and Lighting Unit subsystem (CLU) consists of 4 units. One on each Basic End-Effector and one on each side of the elbow. The Basic End-Effector cameras are used for video and proximity control during grappling and un-grappling operations whereas the elbow cameras are only used for video. All cameras are equipped with lighting units. 6. The EVA Man-Machine Interface (EMMI) is a control panel which provides the possibility to control ERA from EVA. 7. The IVA Man-Machine Interface (IMMI) control panel is a lap-top computer for control of ERA from the pressurised modules of the station.

When not in operation mode,</page><page sequence="3">ERA is in hibernation with all units switched-off with the exception of the heater system. For further reading on the ERA system, please refer to references 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thermal Design The ERA thermal design is more extensively described in Ref. 1 . A short summary of highlights follows. Radiators. The heat dissipated by the electronics is rejected through two radiators mounted on opposite faces of the electronic units. In this way, an acceptable average heat rejection capability can be maintained in operational mode under various ERA positions with respect to the natural and induced environmental thermal conditions. This includes radiators directly facing the sun. Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) MLI covers all external surfaces except the radiators, the optics and some locations where accessibility and clearance constraints apply. The MLI consists of 10 layers with net spacers. The space facing layer is made of Betacloth. Thermal Decoupling Since they are in-Orbit Replaceable Units (ORUs), the cameras are thermally decoupled from the rest of ERA. The handrails are also decoupled from the structure on which they are mounted. Because of the stiffness requirements, no thermal washers could be inserted on the ERA load carrying structure path between adjacent subsystems. However, because the Limbs are made of Titanium and CFRP, the heat leaks to and from the electronics units are moderate. Active Thermal Control Since all ERA units (electronics and motors) are switched off during hibernation, a thermostatically controlled heater system is needed to keep the ERA subsystems above their lower temperature limits. This active system is sized to keep all units above their switch-on temperature limits so that each unit can be switched on at any time without constraints. The switch-on limits are chosen as opposed to the lower non-operating limits to avoid long warm-up times before switch-on. The active thermal control is hot redundant with shifted thermostat switching points for prime and redundant branches. Thermal Modeling The thermal control design of ERA has been developed by several companies. Each of the subcontractors that manufactured an ERA subsystem was also responsible for the thermal control design of that subsystem. Fokker Space, being ERA prime contractor was responsible for integration of all sub-system thermal control designs into one ERA system thermal control design. Fokker Space is also responsible for verification of the ERA system thermal control design. In Table 1 the subcontracting companies with their delivered subsystems are listed. Table 1: ERA subsystem thermal design responsibles Company Subsystem SABCA Belgium Wrist- 1, Wrist-2, Elbow DAS A Bremen End Effector- 1, End Effector-2, Germany OBC Officine Galileo Camera/Lighting Units (CLUs) on Firenze Italy both Limbs near the Elbow, and on Wirst- 1 and Wrist-2. HTS Switzerland Limb-1, Limb-2 Officine Galileo EVA MMI Man Machine Interface Milano Italy (EMMI) In order to verify the performance of their thermal control design each subcontractor has created a detailed geometrical model (DGMM) and a detailed thermal mathematical model (DTMM). Detailed Geometrical Models (DGMMs) The DGMMs were needed to calculate radiative couplings, and absorbed solar input, albedo and earth shine fluxes. All subcontractors have been provided with the ERA Interface geometrical model (EGMM). This crude geometrical model was created by Fokker Space and contained the geometry of the space facing surfaces of all ERA subsystems. The EGMM geometry was not modeled in great detail. Each subcontractor removed in this EGMM the crudely modeled subsystem geometry and replaced that by his own detailed DGMM. Fokker Space also provided each subcontractor with a geometrical ISS interface model (SGMM). Each subcontractor was capable of calculating radiative couplings for his subsystem thermal mathematical model using the EGMM with his own subsystem DGMM inserted in combination with the SGMM geometrical model. In order to avoid interface problems between the DGMMs of the various subcontractors, all DGMMs had to meet amongst others the following requirements: • The program to be used to calculate radiative couplings and absorbed fluxes was THERMICA 2.1 or later. • The geometrical modeling language was ESABASE and a number of well defined restrictions pertaining to the use of this format was clearly defined. All DGMMs were created with respect to a well defined coordinate system so that it accurately could be implemented in the ERA geometrical interface model (EGMM). The coordinate system numbering for each subsystem was prescribed. • It has been attempted to create uniformity in the optical property values for materials that have been used by more than one subcontractor. Each subsystem detailed thermal mathematical model (DTMM) was supplied 685</page><page sequence="4">with thermal nodes representing electrical and mechanical interfaces with the neighbouring subsystems. The radiative couplings with other subsystems of ERA and with ISS were calculated using the EGMM and the SGMM. Fokker Space specified for each subsystem the conductive heat exchange with other ERA subsystems by defining per calculation case the conductive heat flowing in or out of the mechanical and electrical subsystem interface nodes. In view of the responsibility for the verification of the thermal control design on system level, Fokker Space has integrated all detailed Geometrical Models of the subcontractors (DGMMs) into a Comprehensive ERA Geometrical Mathematical Model (CGMM). Detailed Thermal Mathematical Models (DTMMs) The detailed thermal mathematical models of all subsystems have been integrated by Fokker Space into a comprehensive ERA thermal mathematical model (CTMM, &gt;1400 nodes). In order to avoid interface problems between the various DTMMs all ES ATAN submodels had to meet amongst others the following requirements: • Every DTMM had to be created in ES AT AN format such that I could be analyzed by ES AT AN 5.5 or later • Each DTMM had a fixed and well defined node number range • The number of the mechanical and electrical node numbers was prescribed by Fokker Space • The conduction through MLI as a function of the temperature over the MLI on all subsystems has been defined by Fokker Space • All names of constants in a DTMM had to be unique, no two DTMMs could have the same constants name. The same applied to the names of arrays, and subroutines. • Upon delivery to Fokker Space for integration into the ERA CTMM, all radiative couplings in a DTMM with space had to be deleted. To integrate all subsystem DTMMs into one big ERA CTMM, with special developed software each DTMM was split a number of files that each contained the model blocks: • Node Data Block • Constants Block • Conductor Block • Array Block • Subroutine Block • Execution Block • Variables 1 Block • Variables2 Block • Output Block • Parameter Block These separate blocks were sorted per class, grouped together and then integrated in the CTMM. THERMAL BALANCE TEST A system TB test was performed in order to meet the following objectives: • Validation of DTMM of MJS and MLS subsystems • Validation of CTMM for radiative I/F's between subsystems and of the conductive I/F's between adjacent subsystems • Verification of the ERA Thermal Design for operation in simulated solar/vacuum environment • Verification of the S/S design of the MJS and MLS • Verification of the MLI design Test predictions were performed using the CTMM TEST SET-UP DESCRIPTION General ERA was placed centrally in the ESTEC Large Space Simulator facility such that on set of radiators is oriented towards the Solar Simulator and the other set of radiators towards the shroud. See Figure 2. Figure 2: ERA in the ESTEC Large Space Simulator 686</page><page sequence="5">Figure 3: Distribution of thermocouples over ERA Mah ATC return line CLU Man ATC Heater I switch F- ^ Mah ATC power line Figure 4: CLU ATC heater circuit bypass Thermocouple instrumentation For temperature measurement during the test, ERA was equipped with type T thermocouples. One side (OBC side) of the arm was fully instrumented, the other side only the S/S Interface's and critical parts were instrumented. This could be done since the symmetry of the arm made a full instrumentation unnecessary. The distribution of thermocouples over ERA was roughly as in Figure 3. All thermocouples, except for the guard heating were logged by ESTEC Data Handling and were connected to the VTRs in the spin box dome of the Large Space Simulator. Test heaters ERA is provided with ATC heaters, which are activated through thermostat switching when the temperature reaches a given set point. This will mainly occur during periods of hibernation. The ATC of ERA is fully redundant. When a thermostat fails to open, a thermostat in series Man ATC return line Redundant ATC return line Man Redundant ATC ATC Heater Heater 5 5 Thermostats Man ATC power line Redundant ATC power line Figure 5: Main and redundant ATC heater circuits obtains redundancy. When a thermostat fails to close the redundant heater circuit will come into operation. The set points of the thermostats in the redundant line are set lower to avoid double peak power consumption. During the test phases in which the ATC is activated, heater cycling is very likely. This would not lead to a steady-state Man ATC return line Wrist2 Elbow i ' - i Man ATC Heater Man ATC power line Redundant operational power line Figure 6: Wrist2/EIbow Heater Circuit Bypass required for a proper thermal model correlation. Therefore some of the subcontractors built in short circuit or bypass systems. This resulted in the following situation. The CLU ATC thermostat could be short-circuited by means of a switch outside the facility (see Figure 4). Wrist2 and the Elbow used an additional line, which was connecting the redundant operational line and the main ATC heaters. The operational lines were initially intended for operational substitution heaters. These would maintain temperature levels in case internal unit dissipations were not sufficient. This feature is obsolete now but the power lines were still available (see Figure 6). All other subsystems did not have any provision for bypassing the thermostats. For these S/S's (Wristl, OBC, BEE1 and BEE2) test heaters were used. These test heaters were placed on the units. By activating these heaters, the thermostats would remain on a temperature higher then the switch-on set point and therefore no cycling would occur. With the thermal model, calculations were performed to estimate the power needed for these test heaters. The heaters 687</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7: Thermal Adapter were dimensioned with a margin of 100% and were fully redundant. Since the amount of actual heater power is an essential input to the thermal model correlation, this power was measured using calibrated shunts for current measurement and by sensing the heater voltage right on the very heater leads. In the end this resulted in a quite complex circuitry allowing of short-cuts, bypass circuits and test heater circuits which had to be operated in the proper way during the test. This system was tested extensively prior to the TB test itself. THERMAL ADAPTER The main requirements for the Thermal Adapter (TAD) were: • to support ERA in hibernation configuration fully exposed to the solar beam • not to introduce exceptional forces in the joints • to be grappled by ERA using one base point and one grapple fixture • not to be exposed to the solar beam • provide adiabatic interfaces between ERA and its fixations and through all the harnesses. • not to disturb the radiative environment of ERA Constraints were imposed by the facility (height, accessibility of the spin box dome), cleanliness requirements, vacuum conditions, maximum allowable forces on ERA inserts, etc. The Thermal Adapter consisted of two major parts: 1 . The first part was the bottom frame which was the interface with the LS S motion system and which supported the suspension frame and the Base Point and Grapple Fixture Interface beam. 2. The second part was the frame in which ERA was suspended. During the final integration of ERA in the LSS, the bottom frame was provided with scaffolding parts, allowing access to the test item during installation. These were removed prior to the test and the remaining frame parts were covered with MLI and black painted aluminium plates to ensure a homogeneous and well known temperature. The suspension frame was placed on two spherical bearings and was fixed with six stainless steel cables to the bottom frame. Six sets of spring suspensions were used for the cables to meet the loss of tension due to the thermal contraction of the aluminium poles of the frame in cold phases (see Figure 7). ERA SUSPENSION In order to make sure no forces were introduced during the test due to the difference in thermal expansion of the TAD and ERA, The Arm was suspended with a dedicated spring suspension system at the elbow joint. See Figure 2. This system allowed ERA to expand or contract 25mm relative to the TAD during the test. A load cell was installed to check the load on the suspension throughout the test. Due to the hibernation configuration of ERA, suspending the Elbow and grapple both BEEs would not be feasible. The load on the inserts of the elbow suspension would be unacceptable and taking over the loads into the base point and grapple fixture would result in damaging the brakes of the Wrist and Elbow pitch joints, since they are not designed for this type of load. To solve this problem a steel cable was suspended between the pitch joints of the wrists. In this way more load could be transferred to the Base Point and Grapple Fixture. A load equilibrium was found for the elbow suspension, wrist suspension cable and Base Point and Grapple Fixture. To eliminate forces in the arm perpendicular to the arm, spherical bearings were used for mounting the Base Point and Grapple Fixture and suspending the spring suspension of the Elbow. INTERFACE TEMPERATURE CONTROL To create an adiabatic interface between ERA and its adapter, several guard heater systems were used. The guard heater systems consist of 2 thermocouples placed with an intermediate distance of about 20 cm (one at each interface side) and a heater. The temperature difference is measured and the heater is activated in order to eliminate the temperature gradient and therefore the heat flow through the interface. These systems were controlled by PID temperature controllers (see Figure 8). 688</page><page sequence="7">Figure 8: Guard heater system on cable looms The interfaces controlled this way were: • Base point - base point Interface ring • Grapple fixture - base point Interface ring • Elbow suspension bracket - spring suspension • Thermocouple loom base point side • Thermocouple loom grapple fixture side • Cable harness base point side • Cable harness grapple fixture side SUN SHIELDS Additional Kapton foil shields were suspended in the LS S for keeping the Thermal Adapter out of the solar beam. This was necessary since illumination of the TAD would lead to thermal expansion of the suspension frame and reflections of the solar beam from the TAD to ERA. The temperature of the solar shield was measured during the test with thermocouples. This allows correction of the predicted sink temperatures. RADIOMETERS For measuring the sink temperature during the test four radiometers were installed. This was thought to be useful since the solar shields, mirror and auxiliary chamber were expected to disturb the uniformity of the radiative environment. Two radiometers were suspended in the solar beam facing the mirror, one radiometer was suspended in the solar beam facing the door shroud and one radiometer was suspended in the solar shade facing the shroud. The final test set-up is presented in Figure 2. EGSE The EGSE used during the test was roughly split into two parts. One part was used for test heaters and guard heaters control. The other part was the ERA EGSE, used for switching ERA into different modes and for collecting telemetry data. Solar Simulator on Sun simulator I I | | ERA ^ r-oA • i . . , _ _ * u u * .

The powers were calculated on line in Data Handling using virtual channels. ERA CONTROL ERA control consisted of: • DIFA (1553 Data Interface Front-end Assembly) • PFA (Power front End) • Workstations The ERA control was used to send commands to ERA (stand-by, hibernation). The telemetry data from ERA provided information per S/S for powers, modes, healthy status, etc. Reading the data on power supply of the PFA checked the total power consumption. DATA HANDLING ESTEC thermal data handling was used during the test for logging and displaying all test data: • thermocouple data • PT 100 data • voltage data • test facility data shroud temperatures solar intensity chamber pressure Virtual (calculation) channels were implemented for online calculation of: • average temperatures of subsystems • heater powers • steady-states TEST EXECUTION The ERA TB test was executed 24 hours a day from November 8th until November 20th 1999, in three shifts of two persons. TEST PHASES For the TB test the following test phases were defined and executed (see also Figure 9). OBSERVATIONS With respect to discrepancies between predictions and measurements the following was observed during the test: Hot operational switch on (HOSO) • Radiative environment was not as homogeneous as expected. Due to the cool down of the auxiliary chamber to -190°C, this side of ERA "looked" via the LS S mirror at a much colder sink then the side facing the test chamber shroud which was at +20°C. This phenomenon was detected by reading the radiometer data.

Fast cool down (FCDT) The switching on of the various thermostats was nominal. Cold hibernation thermostat switching (CHTS) OBC was colder then expected, power dissipation of the ATC heaters was less then expected. Gradient transient (GRSS) Overall temperature was higher then predicted. For all test phases, the power dissipation of BEEl was much higher then expected. It also appeared that the power readings obtained from the EGSE were not as accurate as it should. This was directly related to the resolution of the A/D converter and the offset of the current sensors in the subsystems. After the test current measurements had to be performed per sub-system to establish the correct power distribution over the subsystems during the test. Current measurements done at subsystem level could not be used since they were performed at bus voltage level of 1 10V while the system level TB test was performed at 120V. TEST RESULTS Thermal Model Correlation The goal of the correlation activity was to simulate the ERA thermal behaviour such to meet the following requirements (with Tp is the predicted temperature and Tm is the measured temperature): • (Tp-Tm) within 1.5 K for the average over all measurement (correlation) points • (Tp-Tm) within 5 K for each individual measurement (correlation) point • The standard deviation of (Tp-Tm) less than or equal to 1.5 K • (ATp-ATm) for temperature gradient, 20% of the measured gradient. In general, there is a good agreement between the results of the test and the predictions, and consequently the correlation will be likely achieved in a short time and, hopefully, with a good result. The difference between the thermocouples of the same subsystem, in some cases, is due to the different pQwer dissipation profile experienced by subsystems during test execution. Some of the differences were due to the incorrect estimation of power dissipated for the model of the prediction, but other (BEE subsystem) were due to a not completely known electrical behaviour of the subsystem. Due above mentioned deviations, the ERA TMM was updated such to consider the actual test article set-up, thermal chamber characteristics and boundary conditions, thermocouples modified positions. As consequence, a first post-prediction analysis runs were performed with the updated values of power dissipation and boundary conditions. In that way, it was possible to reduce the AT detected during the hot case. Some further refinement of TMM was then introduced to reduce discrepancies found in the cold case. Modifications to the various parameters, that make up the thermal mathematical model, are being made within the engineering tolerance of parameters. The priority list of parameters adjusted so far is as follows: 1 . Conductivity of MLI blankets 2. MLI outer layer absorptivity 3. Handrail behaviour 4. Interface conduction between the various subsystems One aspect is worth mentioning: the more relevant differences in temperatures were caused by a systematic error in the evaluation of the conductivity of MLI blankets the due to the compression of internal layers caused by the adaptation of the blankets to the curved surface of the arm. To allow a proper correlation of the system TMM, the MJS and MLS subcontractors actively participated to thermal correlation activities. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS ERA TB Test The Thermal Balance Test on the ERA EQM was completed on November 20th, 1999 at ESA-ESTEC thermal test facility (Large Space Simulator). The applied approach to test some subsystem during the system thermal test gave optimum results in terms of capability to verify the correct functioning of the subsystems with proper thermal interfaces and to reduce total test time. All the required heater circuit switching was exercised during the test. The assessment of data shows a good comparison between the test prediction and the test measured temperatures for the majority of the thermocouples on the EQM Testability Make sure that in the design stage of the project testability of the H/W is feasible. This means: • mechanical: suspension points, inserts support possibilities etc. • electrical: thermostat short circuits, bypasses, current measurements • thermal: the test configuration shall be equal to the flight configuration as far as possible. Reduce deviations as far as possible. Make interfaces with the test environment adiabatic. Test instrumentation in general The saying 'Penny wise, pound foolish' is applicable. A considerable part of the success of the ERA TB test is due to the extensive test instrumentation on the test item. In view of daily testing costs the relatively small investment in test hardware is worthwhile, if delays in testing can be avoided this way. During the test, adequate test instrumentation allows thorough control of the test item and also helps identifying causes of unexpected behaviour. Particular 691</page><page sequence="10">examples of useful test instrumentation are the extensive application of guard heating and the use of radiometers. This provided a good starting position for the test evaluation. Guard Heating Guard heating was extensively used during the ERA TB test. Blocking of interface heat flows reduces uncertainty in the thermal model evaluation and thus can be recommended. The implementation of guard heating with automatic industrial controllers requires little attention of the shift team members. Test item dissipations During this test, several discrepancies were found that were due to differences between assumed and actual unit dissipations. When such a discrepancy was found, an investigation was started and in most cases the issue was resolved. Reliable figures for unit dissipations based on measurements are essential for adequate test predictions. Moreover, this test has learned us to pay special attention to the actual dissipations of the flight model subsystems, as they are measured by the subcontractors. Accurate values of these dissipations are essential for the final flight predictions. Radiometers For non - uniform radiative environments it is important to know and verify the distribution of sink temperature around the test item. Make sure the environment during the test is well known and always use radiometers or similar devices for verification.
