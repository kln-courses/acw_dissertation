<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XXXVIII Recent Literature [167 1967 [6 The second chapter, "Avifaunal Investigations," was prepared by F. S. L. Williamson, Max C. Thompson, and John Q. Hines. It represents the most in- tensive published investigation on terrestrial arctic avifauna and as such will be extremely valuable to ornithologists and ecologists with an interest in the Arctic. Investigations were planned to determine species composition, ecological distribu- tion, density, productivity, and seasonal movements of birds at Cape Thompson. Because the paper is packed with so many valuable data presented partly in tabular form and partly in well-expressed observations and explanations, a quotation of its resume (p. 437) is in order here. "One hundred and twenty species were recorded, and evidence of breeding was obtained for 65 of these. Twelve ecological formations based on character- istics and vegetation and physical features of the environment were used to ana- lyze the distribution of birds. The density of breeding birds ranged from a low of 24 pairs per 100 acres in marshy Carex meadows to 194 pairs per 100 acres in riparian willows. The densities in open habitats were not unlike those observed in similar situations in temperate climates. Nest success of altricial birds building open nests was 43%, only slightly less than the 49% success recorded from a large number of studies at lower latitudes. Birds nesting in the Cape Thompson area rear a single brood each year; a few of the common redpolls attempt a second nesting. Passerine birds have larger clutches than the same or related species in temperate areas, and this compensates to some extent for the failure of these species to produce a second brood. Birds arrive suddenly in spring, and many species are already paired when they arrive. The onset of nesting is rapid, and considerable synchrony is manifest in the breeding and molt programs." It is my understanding that reprints of these chapters will not be available. This is extremely unfortunate because all the chapters contain data that should be widely disseminated.-David W. Johnston. 46. Birds in Our Lives. Alfred Stefferud, editor. 1966. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, D. C. Obtainable from Supt. of Documents, Washington, D. C. 560 pp.; illustrated. $9.00. Two lines of an old rhyme about the sovereigns of England are applicable with changed tenses to the 61 authors of this book: "Some are good and some are bad but most of them are in-betweens." Most of the 54 separate articles grouped into nine chapters are also in-betweens, neither very good nor very bad. Forty-one of the authors were or are federal government employees, 28 quite logically from the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, as is the artist, Bob Hines. The others range from Roger Tory Peterson, Olin Sewall Pettingille, Jr., and Ernst Mayr, whose three articles form the first chapter "In Perspective", through Audubon Society employees and members, museum curators, university people, and journalists, to Barbara Vavo, public relations consultant to a bird food company. The last named does a very fine job for her company, but not for "Birds in the Home," her subject. Her statement that "the canary is now a natuiralized, firmly established resident" of the United States is a blatant absurdity. The editor of this massive undertaking and the managing editor, Arnold L. Nelson, should be heartily congratulated on combining in any order at all such a heterogeneous collection of authors and subjects. The book is designed to inform readers of the influence of birds on their lives. This it will do very well, and it will not often misinform them. It will also show them where and how taxpayers' money is spent by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife and various other federal agencies. After a simple foreword by Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall on the "Web of Life" and a short preface and list of acknowledgments by the editors, Birds in Our Lives proceeds to subjects such as fine arts, philately, photographv, folklore, feather usage (fans and folderols), flight, flying fatalities, flyways, falconry,fisheries, fire, firearms, feeders, farming, forestry, phonics, physiology and futurity, and also poetry, pigeoneers, poultrymen, poisoning, pesticides, pollution, punchcard information, and psittacosis. A surprising omission is archery and the large group of bow-hunting buffs whose arrows have been fletched with the feathers of birds from time immemorial. Although archers might be disappointed to find their bobby missing from Birds in Our Lives, they and all readers will find a revelation ini many aspects of birds in other peoples' lives even to the well informed.</page><page sequence="2">1681 Recent Literature Bird-Banding Outstandiing in this book of many authors is an essay by Roland C. Clement entitled "Mark What You Leave." I would like to see this made "required read- ing" for every high-school student in the United States, read into the Congress- ional Record, and particularly made prescribed reading for the Corps of Army Engineers. Outstanding expositions are "To See. To Record" by Allan D. Cruickshank; "Birds and Bugs" by P. B. Dowden and R. T. Mitchell; "To Fly Like a Bird" by Clarence D. Cone, Jr.; "Where Do They Go?" by Allen J. Duvall; "Birds and Our Health" by Carlton M. Herman; "Birds and Pesticides" by Joseph J. Hickey; "We Are Warned" by R. E. Johnson; "Deathtraps in the Flyways" by John Vosburgh; "Amid Brick and Asphalt" by Irston R. Barnes; a delightful essay on "Sunday at the Zoo" by William G. Conway; and "Before It Is Too Late" by John W. Aldrich who has packed a great deal of information about our recently extinct and endangered species into a limited space. A fine article on poultry by William E. Shaklee and an amusing article on pigeons by W. F. Hollander tell me more than I thought I wanted to know about these domestic species. Birds in Our Lives has its complement of errors, typographical and factual, and some bad writing. Durward Allen of Purdue University received the Wildlife Society award twice, but awkward sentence structure and poor choice of words probably had nothing to do with that honor. A sentence (page 341) that I dislike particularly is: "The bird hobbyist and many other outdoor-minded people place a premium on the seeing value of hawks and owls." In "Birds of the Bible," E. A. Sherman could have identified the birds of prey in Genesis 15 and should have given credit for the picture of Noah's Ark on page 60 to Anton Koberger, the artist who made the original woodcut for "Biblio Sacra Germanica," Nurenberg, 1483, instead of to the Boston Public Library, which happens to have a copy. Other omissions I noted were: Arthur Singer's name among modern bird artists in John Kieran's article; turkey and eagle super- stitions in Will Barker's "Tales Once Told", and the "Nene" and Hawaii from "Symbols of States." Factual errors appear with several inaccuracies in "Symbols of States" by Shirley Briggs. In the flicker story (page 120) she says "the Alabama soldiers of the Confederacy were known as "Yellow Hammers," the colors of their cavalry uniforms recalling this woodpeckers' striking plumage." It was not the color of the uniforms that gave the Alabamians their nickname (they wore the usual confederate gray), but the bits of yellow cloth a Huntsville company wore on their gray sleeves, collars, and coattails. Known jocularly as the "yellowhammer company," their nickname was applied later to all Alabama troops, and confed- erate veterans wore flicker feathers in their caps or lapels during reunions. Dela- ware's blue hen story is also slightly garbled. History credits Captain Caldwell, a Revolutionary War officer from Delaware, with insisting that no fighting cock could be truly game unless its mother was a blue hen. Mrs. Briggs says quite a lot about the Brown Pelican, Louisiana's state bird, but fails to mention its shocking present status there; she was probably unaware that presticides have practically extirpated it from Louisiana. The high point of the section "Sports and Recreation" is the fine photograph on page 146 captioned "Brownie Scouts display bird feeders they made to parents and leaders." Whoever wrote it may be a fine field ornithologist, but his ignor- ance of scout groups will doubtless alienate the affection of the Cub Scouts in the picture and embarrass all the boy scouts and ex-scouts in America. "Long, Long Ago" by Henry B. Collins contains an error that might have been eliminated if this anthropologist had had an ornithological collaborator or a more erudite editor. The range of the Dovekie in page 281 is grossly incorrect. Walter W. Ristow will find a more acceptable derivation of the name "turkey" (page 69) in Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd Edition, unabridged, whose authority was Glover M. Allen. In "Answers to Conflicts" a number of the writers use the word "control'. as a synonym for "kill." This does not make a disagreeable subject any pleasanter. In "Some Birds Like Fish" by some men who do too, J. E. King and R. L. Pyle, the authors, write of svstematic shooting of herons, mergansers, and king- fishers to remove them or control them in the Maritime Provinces. This informa- tion will be a revelation to many readers. The authors describe the oriental cormorant fishing with enough inaccuracies to make me feel sure they have never seen it. A well-trained cormorant ejects the fish without having its neck rubbed,</page><page sequence="3">Vol. XXXVIII Recent Literature [169 1967 [6 and at the last fishing of the. night the master has to remove the ring from each cormorant's neck, pack the throat with fish, and put the ring on top so it will swallow them. Cormorant fishing is no longer profitable commercially. That at Gifu in Japan is operated as a tourist attraction under the subsidy of the Imperial household. The articles "Birds on Stamps" by W. F. Stanley of the State University College, New York and "Birds on Coins" by V. Clain-Stefanelli of the U. S. National Museum deserve special commendation. They will undoubtedly make bird-watchers out of stamp and coin collectors and vice versa. All in all Birds in Our Lives is a very fine book, well illustrated and one of the best book-buys of the decade.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 47. The Whooping Crane / the bird that defies extinction. Faith McNulty. 1966. E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York. 189 pages, illustrated. $4.95. The only fault I can find with this book is its blatantly anthropomorphic subtitle, probably foisted on it by its sales-minded publishers. A far more suitable one, "The thread remains very thin," was given it by the New Yorker magazine, which published much of the book's contents in slightly different form. This fits the circumstances much more accurately. As the book clearly and unmistakably points out, the Whooping Crane has not "defied" extinction, but is barely man- aging to survive, thanks largely to the efforts of the National Audubon Society, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and a handful of dedicated individuals, chief among them my friend, the late Robert Porter Allen, whom the author calls most fittingly the crane's "most ardent and learned champion." While Mrs. McNulty does not claim to be an ornithologist, and so far as I know this is the only article on birds she has published, the book shows her to be a highly capable researcher, an excellent reporter, and a fine writer. She does not seem to have missed a single potential source of information, published or un- published, and she reports a number of significant behind-the-scenes developments she could have learned only by interviewing those close to the events. Most revealing is her delineation of the activities of George Douglass, recently deceased director of the New Orleans zoo, whose maneuverings continually hampered efforts to propagate the species in captivity. The book adds up to a fine contribution to ornithological literature, a clear and lucid exposition of the current status of the Whooping Crane and the species' recent history. The author's simple, straightforward prose maintains the drama and excitement of the case from start to finish, and thank goodness the end is not yet. The birds still have a chance, and efforts such as Mrs. McNulty's in arousing public opinion with such writing are certain to help. I wish every senator and congressman could be made to read it!-O. L. Austin, Jr. 48. Flight Mechanisms and the Orientation of Birds. (Mekhanizmy poleta i orientatsii ptits). S. E. Kleinenberg, editor. 1966. Published for the A. N. Severtsov Institute of Animal Morphology by "Nauka" Publishing House, Moscow. 224 pp. Price 1 ruble, 10 kopecks (about $2.00 U. S.). This book con- sists of an introduction by the editor and eight substantial and well-documented review articles by various authors each with an English summary. In "Some considerations on bionic investigations in ornithology", by N. V. Kokshaiskii the science of "bionics" is defined as a scientific trend attempting to elucidate and apply principles of structure and function evolved by biological systems to the solution of problems in human technology. The use of aims, methods, and prospects of bionically-oriented studies in ornithology is exempli- fied in the problem of flapping-flight. The author suggests that the significance of this problem (other than ornithological) is not so much in creation of flapping- wing aircraft as in the basic physical concepts of "thrust" and "drag." The author states that birds (and all other animals that fly or swim) have long since developed some "thrust generating mechanism" the essential features of which are still unknown. Several possible factors are discussed. In "Mechanization and automation of the birds' wing" by V. E. Yacobi, structural devices presumably effecting increase of lift (wing-tip slots, features of wing surface and of particular feathers) are discussed. Wing automation is mani- fested in adjustments to aerodynamic conditions as afforded by structure of certain feathers, location of their ligaments. and structure of boundary between calamus and rhachis.</page></plain_text>
