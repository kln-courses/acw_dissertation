<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURATORIAL REPORTS AMERICAN DECORATIVE ARTS In anticipation of the Phase I opening of the old Amer- ican Wing and a major part of the new American Bicentennial Wing and the Charles W. Engelhard Garden Court in May 1980, our preparatory activities, continuing since we closed six years ago, have heightened. Full-size drawings, scale photography of case arrangements, mod- els of design installation problems, restoration and con- servation work, as well as period room decorations of so vast a project have involved the study and attention of every member of the staff with an intensity unequalled in the recent history of the department. Contractual services for a major rehabilitation and numerous detailed alterations to the old American Wing were completed, largely under curatorial supervision. Special problems such as reproducing delicate plaster ornament for four period rooms were skillfully accom- plished by the sculptor-modeler, David Flaharty. A rare early American blue-grey marble from the extinct King of Prussia, Pennsylvania quarries was located and given to the Museum. It will be used to trim several period room chimney breasts. Without the resources and skills of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Dikeman, who have so generously given to the Museum their time and materials, the perfect restoration of our great Tiffany mosaic fountain-mural and loggia would have been difficult, if not impossible. Among our most appealing accessions this year was an enchanting document of the American Wings old U.S. Branch Bank facade. It is the original drawing by New York's early 19th century illustrator, Charles Burton, clearly delineating the classic marble building in its origi- nal Wall Street setting in 1831, only five years after it was built. The drawing was purchased from a special fund given by Robert G. Goelet. To our small but superlative group of Philadelphia Federal period furniture we added a highly carved mahogany arm chair with a rare cushion splat of the Haines-Connelly school from funds given by Mr. and Mrs. George M. Kaufman and Mr. and Mrs. Eric Martin Wunsch. The most exciting acquisition of the year was the original mosaic fountain base to the Tiffany United States Branch Bank, Wall Street, 1831 by Charles Burton; Robert G. Goelet Fund. mosaic mural already in the collection. It was until re- cently believed to have been lost or destroyed, but was found stored in a Maryland barn and generously given to the Museum by its owner, Mrs. L. Groves Geer. The mural, a 1976 gift of Lillian Nassau and its newly acquired fountain base, will be reunited in their original irrides- cent splendor in the new Garden Court. In addition to the many-faceted activities of creating a new American Wing, the staff carried on its academic work with 14 lectures, attendance at five conferences, three articles for publication and one university course. Several hundred superb photographs of our Queen Anne and Chippendale furniture were finished in prepa- ration for that forthcoming catalogue. Berry B.

Preparation of the three volume catalogue of the American paintings collection, to be published in 1980, has been the primary occupation of John Caldwell, Oswaldo Rodriguez, Dale Johnson, Meg Perlman, Amy Walsh, Natalie Spassky, Doreen Bolger Burke and Kathleen Luhrs. The Surdna Foundation con- tinued its invaluable support of this project. Lewis Sharp has continued to act as curatorial coordinator of the building installation, working closely with the staff of this department, the Departments of American Dec- orative Arts, Design, Objects Conservation, Paintings Conservation and the Office of the Vice President for Architecture. The Curator was appointed coordinator of educational programs for the American Wing, which involves overseeing preparations for recorded tours, guidebooks, explanatory labels, gallery lectures, lecture programs, symposia and similar projects. The major paintings and frame conservation program in anticipa- tion of installation of the new building also continued. A comprehensive inventory of all parts of the collection was instituted and is planned for completion before the move into the new facilities. Following the stated policy of deaccessioning redun- dant and minor objects to make way for the acquisition of major works, the trustees, on the recommendation of the department, deaccessioned a group of 29 paintings. The group, which includes Thomas Cole's Fountain of the Vaucluse, William Harnett's Still Life with a Letter to Denis Hale and George Inness' Evening, following Museum pol- icy and procedure, will be offered for sale either to other public institutions or at public auction. Also, a group of American paintings bequeathed to the Museum by the late Vera Ruth Miller was sold at public auction and the proceeds have been put toward the purchase of an ex- tremely important seascape by Fitz Hugh Lane, Stage Fort Across Gloucester Harbour painted in 1862 toward the end of his career. Thus the Museum now owns two fine exam- ples by Lane, who is considered one of the most impor- tant American painters of atmospheric landscape. The department also acquired, through gift, bequest and purchase, a number of very important works of art, all of which fill specific needs in the collection. Among the gifts are: Philip Hale'sNiagara Falls, given by Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Fraad; a large group of F. Luis Mora drawings and H. A. MacNeil's bronze statue The Moqui-A Prayer for Rain - The Returning of the Snakes, all given by Mr. and Mrs. Walter C. Crawford; Gilbert Stuart's portrait of Mrs. An- drew Sigourney, gift of Donald F. Bush in memory of his wife, Harriet P. Bush; and John Kensett's drawing White Mountains, October 16, 1850, gift of Michael St. Clair. The late Mary Cushing Fosburgh bequeathed the Museum Winslow Homer's Surf at Marshfield, an oil sketch for his High Tide: The Bathers, owned by the Museum. The Fos- burgh bequest also included Thomas Eakins' beautiful 1869 portrait of a Spanish girl, Carmelita Requena, which becomes the earliest Eakins in the collection. John K.

A gift from Raymond R. Sackler has enabled us to proceed with the construction of a gallery to house the limestone reliefs from 9th century B.C. Assyria. The new room will be known as the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Gallery for Assyrian Art and an adjacent study-storage area will be called the Richard and Jonathan Sackler Study Center. Three additional galleries next to the Assyrian sculpture hall will provide for the display of a wide selection of Ancient Near Eastern works of art. The renovation of these three galleries has been made possible by a gift from The Hagop Kevorkian Fund. The department's principal accession is a group of 40 bronze bells from diverse eras and various areas of the Near East, a gift of Nathaniel Spear, Jr. The staff has been engaged in a wide range of re- search projects. Prudence O. Harper has completed three manuscripts: an entry, "Sasanian Art" for The Dic- tionary of the Middle Ages; an article, "Thrones and En- thronement Scenes in Sasanian Art" for Iran XVII (1979); and a book, Royal Images on Sasanian Silver Vessels which is being underwritten by The Hagop Kevorkian Fund. Dr. Harper, with Holly Pittman, was responsible for the preparation of a model of the Assyrian relief installa- tion, for the gallery layouts and for the choice of explana- tory material for the Assyrian reliefs and for the whole of the Ancient Near Eastern reinstallation. In 1978 Holly Pittman again represented the Mu- seum in the excavations at Malyan Tepe (ancient Anshan) in southwestern Iran. She supervised an area of the dig- ging; the glyptic material for the 1978 season and all seasons past is her responsibility. Miss Pittman also stud- ied the seals and sealings of the Proto-Elamite period in the Muse Iran Bastan in Tehran. She lectured to seminar classes at Brooklyn College and at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. Oscar White Muscarella continued to publish and lecture. Archaeological relations between Greece and Iran were discussed in JANES 9, which appeared in the spring of 1979 and in a lecture at the University of Penn- sylvania. He lectured at Wellesley College on excavated versus unexcavated antiquities and wrote on this subject in the review of two books in JFA 5, 2 (1978). Dr. Mus- carella also spoke about the smuggling and forgery of antiquities before the American Academy for Profes- sional Law Enforcement. The writer's "Inscriptions from Lagash, Season Four, 1975-76" appeared in JCS XXIX 4 (October 1977). He also transliterated and translated 32 economic texts from the Third Dynasty of Ur (ca. 2100 B.C.) for the Newark Public Library. The writer lectured about the excavations at Tell al-Hiba at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. NEH Fellow Ira Spar has virtually completed his study of the 280 best preserved and 94 fragmentary texts of the Museum's Neo-Babylonian economic and admin- istrative texts. Dr. Spar is now engaged in studying the literary texts (Neo-Babylonian period) in our collection. NS Fellow Donald Whitcomb has expanded the scope of his studies from the western portion of Qasr-i Abu Nasr (6th-14th century A.D.) to include the major excavations on the citadel. Plates ready for publication include those on ceramic typology and metal work. Kevorkian Fellow Joan Aruz has been involved in Four of forty bells, ranging in date from the mid- 2nd millennium B.C. to the end of the 1st millennium A.D.; Gift of Nathaniel Spear, Terracotta vessel in the form of a boar; Iran; 3rd millennium B.C.; Rogers Fund and Anonymous Gift. 20</page><page sequence="6">two Museum projects. For the forthcoming exhibition of the Assyrian reliefs of Assurnasirpal II she has completed the drawings of the incised patterns on the garments of the figures. She is also making the final drawings of the seal impressions on the tablet envelopes of the Old As- syrian colony period (ca. 19th century B.C.) of Anatolia for future publication. High school apprentices Lisa Valkenier and Maria Hamburg have both worked consistently and well. Miss Valkenier has completed the photographic notebooks necessary for the reinstallation of the Ancient Near East- ern galleries. Miss Hamburg has performed many de- partmental tasks and has become acquainted with our collection both by examination of objects and assigned readings. Vaughn E.

Lenders to the Department Ben-Zion Mrs. Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff ARMS AND ARMOR In order to ease the heavy traffic flow from the popular new installation, the Temple of Dendur, and the two major loan exhibitions Treasures of Tutankhamun and The Splendor of Dresden, the Armor Hall was partially rear- ranged. During the latter exhibition a very impressive pair of jousters (Scharf rennen) from the Historische Mu- seum, Dresden, was set up in the rear of the Armor Hall, because it could not be fitted into the upper floor galleries allotted for the Dresden show. The current special mini- exhibition Polish Arms and Armor centered around a 17th century Polish hussar's scale armor, a loan from the Na- tional Museum, Wawel Castle, Cracow, was cut down in size, but was kept on exhibition. These temporary ar- rangements were facilitated by transferring a number of relevant objects, such as a rack of Saxon parade polearms, to the Dresden exhibition as auxiliary material. Considerable time and effort were spent by prac- tically every member of our department with the installa- tion and dismantling of the exhibition The Splendor of Dresden, which included more than 130 objects from the Historische Museum, once the Rüstkammer (armory) of the Electors of Saxony, and one of the finest collections of its kind. Robert Carroll, Armorer, helped with the in- stallation of the exhibition in the National Gallery, Wash- Sketch for a parade shield in the style of the French Royal Court workshop, ca. 1560; Rogers Fund. 21</page><page sequence="7">ington, while the Curator gave a series of lectures about the historic and artistic background of Dresden in Wash- ington, San Diego and New York. In connection with the Dresden exhibition symposia were held in our Museum and in San Francisco; the Curator read a paper "The Arms and Armor of the Dresden Palace Guards" in New York, and another "The Dresden Rüstkammer as a Work- ing Arsenal" in San Francisco. After the Dresden show, work started with the in- stallation of Treasures from the Kremlin which contained pieces of arms and armor from the Kremlin Armory. Leonid Tarassuk, Research Associate, read a paper, "The Kremlin Armory Workshops", at the symposium held in connection with the Kremlin show. The department has added 40 objects to its long list of outstanding loans. Work on the department's catalogue project is pro- gressing steadily. Stephen V. Grancsay, Curator Emeritus, is preparing the volume Firearms', Leonid Tarassuk, Re- search Associate, and David Alexander, Research Assis- tant, are continuing with Edged Weapons, European and Islamic, and Stuart W. Pyhrr, Assistant Curator, is re- searching the volume European Armor. The Assistant Curator read a paper "Armorers and Goldsmiths in Paris in the Sixteenth Century" at the Central Renaissance Conference held at the Cleveland Museum of Art in March. Leonid Tarassuk published an article "Some Notes on Parrying Daggers and Poniards" in the Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 12 (1978), and the Curator wrote a note "And Behold a White Horse. . .Ob- servations on the Colors of the Horses of the Four Horse- men of the Apocalypse" for the same publication, for which he continued to serve on its Editorial Board. As Adjunct Professor at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, the Curator gave a course during the spring semester entitled "Costume, Armor and Heraldry".

THE COSTUME INSTITUTE The past year was a period rich in diverse activities, projects and acquisitions. Our exhibition, Diaghilev: Cos- tumes and Designs of the Ballets Russes, selected and ar- ranged by Diana Vreeland, Special Consultant for Exhibitions, opened in November with our annual bene- fit. We are deeply grateful to the Chairman, Mrs. William F. Buckley, Jr. and to the other committee members whose unstinting efforts made our opening such a successful gala event. Our previous exhibition Vanity Fair, which featured the highlights of our collection, traveled to the St. Louis Art Museum. We were gratified to learn that it attracted almost 125,000 viewers there. Other loans went to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum for the exhibition Ornament in the Twentieth Century, the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts for Fashion Accessories, 1930's-1970's, and 17 costumes were lent to the Fashion Institute of Technology for an exhibition entitled American Living, Turn of the Century. We also lent a wedding dress by Anne Lowe, a famous black American couturière, to the Black Fashion Museum for an exhibition of the work of black designers. We thank our very able volunteers who, under the direction of our Senior Restorer, Elizabeth Lawrence, have spent untold hours preparing costumes both for our exhibitions and for loan. It is their enthusiastic assistance that has enabled us to keep up with the pace of mounting major costume exhibitions annually without sacrificing quality. This year's acquisitions served to strengthen the comprehensive scope of our collection. Gifts from Mrs. F. H. Prince, Jr. and Mrs. Anatole R. Gruehr have enriched our holdings of sportswear. Mrs. John Held, Jr. presented us with her husband's legendary raccoon coat. Janet Sloane of Madcaps International donated a superb selec- tion of headgear designed by leading French designers. J. Heim of Bally of Switzerland donated a rare pair of mules ca. 1750. Other gifts included costumes from the ward- robes of two American women known for their individual taste in fashion, Julia B. Henry and Barbara C. Paley. Our most unusual acquisition was a jacket made of tan vinyl covered with approximately 18,000 small brass safety pins arranged in overlapping waves and geometric pat- terns. Designed by Mark Mahall of Boston, it was pre- sented to us by Arthur and Joan Mahall and family. Other equally welcome gifts are listed elsewhere. Through purchase, we were able to acquire a unique round gown from the Directoire period (ca. 1795) and two exceptionally fine Croatian costumes. Among the donations to our Irene Lewisohn Cos- tume Reference Library were such valuable additions as Storia del Costume in Italia, gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Taubman; a collection of stereoscope slides from 1910-15 22</page><page sequence="8">showing fashionable society at the Longchamps race course, gift of Shannon Rodgers; and 120 original water- colors from the 19th century showing Indian figures wearing costumes of various castes and occupations, gift of the Viscountess Rothermere. This year we had 217 designer appointments. From Parsons School of Design, 45 classes came to work with our collections, 28 from Pratt Institute and four from New York University. We were able to schedule 128 tours from 27 states and Canada; over 2,500 students were taken through our study-storage by our tour guides. The Costume Institute also presented a three-part lecture series for Museum members. These centered on male fashions and included a tour of study-storage. Our department also played host to approximately 120 mem- bers of the Costume Society of America. The Curator participated in the Museum's "Sunday at the Metropolitan" lecture program and presented two lectures at J.C. Penney as a part of the Museum's "Art Lectures in the Office" series. Other lectures were given in St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Lexington, Mass. The Curator attended the conference of the ICOM Costume Committee in Lisbon. Assistant Curator Judith McGee lectured on 19th and early 20th century costume at The Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn., and Assis- tant Curator Paul Ettesvold lectured on 19th century French fashions for WGMS in Washington. Publications by the Curator included an article on "Fantasy in Dress" for the Erté program presented at the Boston Civic Center and an article on "Costume: Vanity and Art" for the St. Louis Museum Newsletter. A new book, edited and with an introduction by the Curator, Ackermann' s Costume Plates, Women's Fashion in England, 1818-1828, has just been published.

A spirited pen drawing by Pietro da Cortona, The Virgin and Child with St. Martina, came to us as the bequest of Benjamin Sonnenberg; this drawing is a study for a paint- ing in the Landon collection in New York that has often been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum. Three fine 18th century French drawings, works by Fragonard, Wat- teau de Lille, and J.-G. Wille were presented by Mrs. Howard J. Sachs and Peter G. Sachs in memory of Edith L. Sachs. Alexander and Grégoire Tarnopol gave us a double-faced sheet of studies by Daumier. One of the most significant purchases was a Design for a Covered Vase The Virgin and Child with St. Martina by Pietro da Cortona; Bequest of Benjamin Sonnenberg. with the Arms of the Aldobrandini and Pamphilj Families by Alessandro Algardi, a 17th century sculptor who was not previously represented in our collection as a draughts- man. An illustrated inventory, 17th Century Italian Draw- ings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, was published in May and the appearance of this volume was celebrated by an exhibition of some 50 drawings chosen from the 379 works included in the publication. Work has already be- gun on the volume to follow, which will be devoted to Italian drawings of the 15th and 16th centuries.

Lender To The Department Nora Simon This year saw the culmination of the department's work on three major projects. On September 18, 1978 the Temple of Dendur opened to the public in a modern stone setting reflecting the original site. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to underscore the significance of the event in the history of American-Egyptian relations and of the Museum. Schol- ars offered lectures on the Temple's reconstruction, his- tory and symbolism. Then, on November 30, Phase II of the department's reinstallation opened in seven new gall- eries. The project- which comprised primary objects of the Amarna Period through Dynasty 29- was as gener- ously funded by Lila Acheson Wallace as the Phase I galleries were. It will be completed by construction of study-storage areas and the loan of the Schimmel collec- tion of Amarna reliefs this fall. Finally, on December 11, 1978 the long-awaited Trea- sures of Tutankhamun capped its Metropolitan Museum- coordinated U.S. tour with a grand New York opening. As in all other phases of the Museum-coordinated tour, the exhibition had the curatorial supervision of the de- partment working with the Conservation, Security, De- Relief with the hand of Akhenaten, Amarna Period, ca. 1365 B.C.; Norbert Schimmel Collection. 25</page><page sequence="11">sign and Public Information Departments. Additionally, a series of lectures by prominent Egyptologists was held. Meanwhile work began on Phase III, the final stage of the reinstallation. This phase comprises the most re- nowned material of the collection, Hatshepsuts monu- mental statuary, gold jewelry of Dynasties 12-18 and 18th Dynasty objects of daily life. Old Kingdom through Dy- nasty 11 galleries were closed to provide storage and work space for the later material while galleries for it were prepared. The department's entire collection will be on view in September 1980. Great benefit was derived from the exchange with colleagues brought to New York by the year's events, and the curatorial staff itself lectured, taught courses and published articles and chapters. Departmental publication projects were advanced by the formal agreement that JJ. Clère would prepare the Museum's non-excavated religious texts for publication; Dieter Arnold's manuscript on Nebheptras Temple con- tinued in press; and a study of Egyptian painting as represented in the Museum's unparalleled collection of facsimile wall-paintings was written by Charles K. Wilkin- son for a Bulletin and subsequent catalogue of the depart- ment's holdings. Noteworthy progress in record-keeping was made by the hiring of a librarian to catalog 400 "first copies" donated by former curators; and the inventory of 10,000 objects displayed in Phase I was completed. Attention was given to acquisitions, but with the usual difficulty of finding objects that significantly con- tribute to the collection and are satisfactorily docu- mented. An Amarna relief block purchased in 1975 and later learned to have been stolen from Egypt was deacces- sioned and returned to Egypt in September in accor- dance with the department's resolve to help protect Egypt's cultural property. Loans of superb quality were received from two friends of the department: 25 Amarna talatats from the Norbert Schimmel collection and one from the collection of Bernard Pomerance.

Lenders to the Department Bernard Pomerance Norbert Schimmel EUROPEAN PAINTINGS This past year has seen the installation and reopening of four galleries of Northern Renaissance painting. The new display has been made possible by a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Jack Linsky. As a result, this remarkable collection is now shown in the way that it deserves. The first three galleries in the new installation of Italian 14th and 15th century paintings have also been completed. These com- prise a room of Italian Gothic paintings and galleries devoted to 15th century secular painting and North Ital- ian quattrocento paintings. The introduction of glass vitrines in these rooms has made possible the exhibition of a larger number of small paintings than heretofore. Considerable progress has been made with the relabeling of other galleries; new and more informative labels now appear on all exhibited paintings before the late 18th century. El Greco's Miracle of Christ Healing the Blind and The Penitent Magdalen, by Georges de La Tour, have come to the Museum as the most recent in a series of gifts from Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman. The El Greco, painted shortly after the artist's arrival in Spain, joins a group of later pictures which includes the View of Toledo and the portrait of Cardinal Nino de Guevara. The Penitent Mag- dalen, La Tour's allegory of human frailty and mortality, joins The Fortune Teller, a genre picture by which his work had previously been represented here. A contribution from Mr. and Mrs. Claus von Biilow has made possible the purchase of Winterhalter's portrait of the Empress Eugénie, and a view of The Outer Harbor of Brest by Louis Nicolas van Blarenberghe was presented by Mrs. Vincent Astor. A self-portrait of Eugène Carrière has been se- cured with funds supplied by the Albert Otten Founda- tion. As part of the bequest of former trustee Mary C. Fosburgh the department acquired a portrait by Toulouse-Lautrec, an early Pissarro, and works by two British artists, William Nicholson and Walter Sicken. Fi- 26</page><page sequence="12">The Penitent Magdalen by Georges de La lour, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman. nally, the Museum's baroque holdings have been further strengthened by the purchase of two paintings, Mattia Preti's dramatic representation of Pilate Washing his Hands and an altarpiece representing The Madonna and Child with Saints by Giulio Cesare Procaccini. The Procaccini was acquired with funds given by Enid A. Haupt. Eleven paintings from The Bryan Collection have been lent by the trustees of the New- York Historical So- ciety. This group includes a number of Italian paintings of exceptional quality, especially the birthplate of Lorenzo de Medici and a fine large altarpiece by Nardo di Cione representing the Madonna and Child with Four Saints. There are, in addition, portraits by Ter Borch and Philippe de Champaigne, and a Venus and Cupid as- cribed to the elder Cranach. Domenichinos monumental altarpiece of The Assumption of the Virgin with Saints Nicholas ofMyra and Ann, has been lent by Mr. and Mrs. Wrights- man for exhibition in the Italian baroque gallery. Long-term loans from private collectors wishing to remain anonymous include: a portrait of Princess Charlotte of France by Jean Clouet; a Canaletto of Som- erset House from the Thames; and five French paintings, including Manet's Kearsarge at Boulogne. During the sum- mer months it has again been possible to show a number of distinguished 19th century French paintings deposited on loan by friends of the Museum. Our visitors have enjoyed superb examples of the work of Cézanne, Degas, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Manet, Monet and Toulouse- Lautrec. A Tintoretto self-portrait was on view in gallery 2, and a Venetian subject by Francesco Guardi belonging to the same collector enhanced our 18th century Venetian holdings. The department extends its thanks to the anon- ymous lenders whose pictures have so enhanced the per- manent display. Our own program of loans continues apace. To the exhibition devoted to French Art of The Second Empire, shown in Philadelphia, Detroit and Paris, the department sent Courbet's Woman with a Parrot and Oedipus and the Sphinx by Moreau, as well as continuing the loan of the portrait of the Empress Eugénie by Winterhalter. A por- trait of the Capel sisters went to the Lely retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery in London, while Boy Blow- ing Bubbles and The Silver Tureen toured with the Chardin show to Paris, Cleveland and Boston. The department contributed two canvasses by Salvator Rosa to an exhibi- tion at Wellesley College. Jacopino del Conte's portrait of Michelangelo went to the Morgan Library and loans were made to two benefit exhibitions. The reprint of the catalogue of Florentine paintings and a new catalogue devoted to the Sienese and Central Italian paintings in the permanent collection are now available. These volumes, the work of Federico Zeri, as- sisted by Elizabeth Gardner and other staff members, are part of a continuing series. The next one to be published will be devoted to the North Italian schools. The man- uscript of an illustrated inventory of paintings by Euro- pean artists born before 1875 has also gone to press, and is scheduled for publication in November.

In the fall, The Splendor of Dres- den was installed by the Chairman, assisted by Clare Vin- cent and Clare Le Corbeiller, working closely with the Departments of Arms and Armor, Drawings, European Paintings and Prints. Clare Vincent and Clare Le Cor- beiller later accompanied the exhibition to the San Fran- cisco Museums of the Legion of Honor and participated in its installation. During the winter, the Chairman super- vised the translation and editing of the catalogue for Treasures from the Kremlin and later installed the exhibition with the assistance of Jessie McNab and Johanna Hecht and the Department of Arms and Armor. Both exhibi- tions entailed close cooperation with the teams of Ger- man and Russian curators who accompanied the works of art. The department was heavily involved in providing loans for exhibitions elsewhere: nine bronzes by Giam- bologna were lent to the exhibition organized by the Arts Council of Great Britain and seen in Edinburgh, London and Vienna; while Carpeaux' marble bust of Napoleon III was lent to The Second Empire exhibition in Philadephia and Detroit. The department also provided one-third of the loans for the exhibition Under the Classical Spell, organized by James Draper for the National Pinakothek in Athens. The collections of the department were significantly enriched by several purchases and gifts. The most spec- tacular of these were four Beauvais tapestries represent- ing The Four Continents, and, en suite with them, a set of tapestry covers for two settees and 12 armchairs, woven about 1790-93 after designs by Jean-Jacques-François Le Barbier. These remarkable tapestries were acquired thanks to a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Claus von Bülow. We were also delighted to acquire two superb examples of silversmithwork: a large sideboard dish depicting The Judgment of Paris, probably made in England in the third quarter of the 17th century by an anonymous Dutch or German master, also purchased with funds provided by Mr. and Mrs. von Bülow; and a pair of silver-gilt cruet Bronze statuette depicting two men wrestling, workshop of Fer- dinando Tacca, Italian (Florence), last quarter 17th century; Gift of Mrs. Howard Sachs and Peter G. Sachs in memory of Edith L. Sachs. frames by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot, made in Paris about 1817, the gift of Audrey B. Love in memory of C. Ruxton Love, Jr. Equally welcome was a generous gift from John T Dorrance, Jr. in memory of Elinor Dorrance Ingersoll which enabled us to acquire a pair of 18th century busts by Joseph Nollekens. These portraits of Alexander Pope and Laurence Sterne will be shown in our English galleries. Our French 18th century furniture collection was further enhanced by several gifts from Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman. The finest of these are a marquetry writing table signed by Joseph Baumhauer and a set of four neoclassical gilt-bronze wall brackets supplied for 28</page><page sequence="14">the use of Louis XVI in 1788. Italian Renaissance and Baroque bronzes are increasingly difficult to acquire, so we were fortunate in receiving the gift of five dis- tinguished examples from Mrs. Howard J. Sachs and Peter G. Sachs; an allegorical figure of a Virtue or Sibyl by Agostino Zoppo from Fred and Rita Richman; and four statuettes from the estate of Mrs. James Fosburgh. The year was unusually busy for the Textile Study Room, where Jean Mailey made the collections and her expertise available to an ever-increasing number of visi- tors, scholars, students and designers. During the year, several special research projects were carried out by the curators. Clare Vincent studied English clock- and watchmakers in London and Conti- nental Renaissance goldsmithwork in collections in Ger- many and Austria. William Rieder studied English and Italian furniture in London and Florence and was visiting specialist for Italian furniture at the Memorial Art Gal- lery of the University of Rochester. In addition, James Parker lectured at the J. Paul Getty Museum at Malibu; Jessie McNab gave six lectures at the New York University School of Continuing Studies and at the Museums of Fine Arts of San Francisco; and Penelope Hunter-Stiebel spoke at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and Technology in Washington, D.C. Lectures were also given at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum by Clare Le Cor- beiller, James Draper and Jean Mailey. Publications by the curators included the Guide to the Wrightsman Galleries, co-authored by James Parker and Clare Le Corbeiller; the catalogue of Under the Classical Spell by James Draper, as well as articles by him in An- tologia di Belle Arti, Revue de l'Art and the Metropolitan Museum Journal. Penelope Hunter-Stiebel published an article in the Bulletin of the Museum of Art and Technology at the University of Michigan and William Rieder published in Apollo and Furniture History. Clare Vincent co-authored an Detail from a tapestry symbolizing "America," from a set of four tapestries representing "The Four Continents," after designs by Jean-Jacques-François Le Barbier, French (Beau vais), ca. 1790-93; Mr. and Mrs. Claus von Bülow Gift. essay in the catalogue of the Munich exhibition, Die Welt als Uhr, and Jean Mailey continued as editor of the Bul- letin of the Needle and Bobbin Club. The Chairman published an article, "A New Bacchic Group by Bernini" in Apollo, delivered a paper at the Dresden symposium in New York and another one at the Dresden symposium in San Francisco, and lectured on Treasuresfrom the Kremlin at the Museum. She also attended the Giambologna Conference in Edinburgh and con- ducted a seminar on French 17th and 18th century sculp- ture at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University.

Lenders to the Department Sir John Pope-Hennessy George William Rutler Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman Anonymous (3) 30</page><page sequence="16">FAR EASTERN ART The department had a busy year working on a number of important projects which will see completion during the next two years. The loan exhibition, The Great Bronze Age of China, from the People's Republic of China is scheduled to open in April 1980 and will later travel to four other American cities. The Chinese Garden Court and its ad- joining Ming furniture room as well as the adjacent gal- lery for Sung and Yuan painting are scheduled to open in June 1980. The following year will see the installation of the permanent Japanese galleries. In connection with the design of the Garden Court, a delegation of Chinese garden experts, at the invitation of the Museum, visited and presented a proposal and a model of the Garden Court and the Ming furniture room. Later, the Director and Wen Fong visited China in connection with the Bronze Age exhibition and the Garden Court. A team of technical experts led by Arthur Rosenblatt, Vice President for Architecture and Plan- ning, also traveled to China to inspect the Garden Court prototype being built in Soochow. Following this visit, Wen Fong accompanied Mrs. Vincent Astor, Chairman of the department's Visiting Committee as well as a trustee of the Museum, to finalize details of the Garden Court. Unexpected and most welcome help for the early start of the new installation of the permanent Japanese galleries came at the time of Japanese Prime Minister Ohira's state visit in May. On behalf of the Japanese gov- ernment the Prime Minister presented a generous gift of $1 million, to assist with installation of our important Japanese collections. Julia Meech-Pekarik traveled to Japan supported both by a Metropolitan Museum travel grant and by a grant from The Japan Society for the Promotion of Sci- ence. She published an article, "Disguised Scripts and Hidden Poems in an Illustrated Heian Sutra: Ashide and Uta-e in the Heike Nögyö", in Archives of Asian Art XXXI (1977-78) and another article, "Metropolitan Bijut- sukanzö Kannon-Kyö Emaki" (An Illustrated Kannon- kyö Handscroll in The Metropolitan Museum of Art) in Nihon Emakimono Zenshïï, vol. 25, Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten (May) 1979, pp. 14-23 (in Japanese). Both Dr. Meech-Pekarik and Suzanne Valenstein lec- tured at the American Ceramic Circle annual meeting. Mrs. Valenstein also lectured at the Birmingham, Ala- bama, Museum of Art and published an article "Some Celadons Reclaimed From The Sea" in Oriental Art Maga- zine, Spring 1979. Julia Murray published an article "An Album of Paintings by Yun Shou-p'ing, The Recluse of Nan-T'ien" in the Record of the Princeton University Art Museum. Miss Murray has been awarded a Mellon fellowship for a half year to finish her Ph.D. dissertation and will then take a position at the Freer Gallery. Jean Mailey lectured at the Katonah Gallery on Ch'ing costumes - "The Wearers of The Dragon Robe"- and also gave a lecture on Chinese Detail of handscroll K-ang-hsi Emperor's Second Tbur of the South (January 2 8- April 8, 1689) by Wang Hui and his assistants, Chinese: The Dillon Fund Gift. rugs to the Haji Baba Society. She also toured China. The entire department cooperated to produce the Museums 1979 engagement calendar. The Far East conservation studio has been doing extensive restoration on three important handscrolls and the famous Tribute Horse painting. The staff has com- pletely remounted a six-panel screen and also has re- mounted a number of hanging scrolls. Noteworthy among a large group of fine acquisitions are three paintings. A handscroll, one of a series of 12, was purchased with a gift from the Dillon Fund. Painted by Wang Hui (1632-1717) and his assistants, it is in excel- lent condition and of extraordinary height. It depicts the Emperor K'ang-hsi's Second Tour of the South and de- scribes the Emperor's journey to Shantung province where he worshipped at the great temples of Mt. T'ai, the Sacred Eastern Peak of China. A handscroll "Autumn Colors Among Streams and Mountains" by Shen Chou, and a hanging scroll "Shaded Dwellings among Streams and Mountains" by Tung Ch'i-chang, were both the gifts of Douglas Dillon. Also among our notable acquisitions of the year was the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Jerome Koizim of a small clay figurine, probably from northern Japan and dating from the latest Jömon period (ca. 1000-250 B.C.). It is an important addition to our early Japanese collec- tion. Our Indian collection was enhanced with a stone image of the Buddha, a Gupta work of the fifth century A.D. A fine large Chinese vase, porcelain painted in underglaze blue, Wan-li mark and period (1573-1620), was the gift of Mrs. Eugene L. Garbâty in memory of Eugene L. Garbâty. Through the gift of Captain and Mrs. Roger Gerry an interesting Japanese bottle of irregular shape and unusual construction has come into our collec- tion. The design was formed by the joining of different 31</page><page sequence="17">clays to produce the pattern of the exterior. The artist was Kawai Kanjiro (1889-1966).

Lenders to the Department Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Carroll Mr. and Mrs. John Menke Robert M.Fomon Anonymous (1) Most of the activities of the department in the last year centered around two loan exhibitions. One hundred and four Greek and Roman objects went to Moscow and Leningrad, in the exhibition Ancient Art from the Metro- politan Museum, in exchange for the treasures lent by the Kremlin museums to the Metropolitan. The Chairman wrote a catalogue for the exhibition of Ancient Art. The other exhibition, entitled Greek Art of the Aegean Islands, is scheduled to open later this month in the Metropolitan Museum. It comes to us from Greece and the Louvre. Initially prepared by the Greek Ministry of Culture and Science and the Association Française d'Action Artis- tique, the Museum was invited to participate, an oppor- tunity the more readily seized since the Museum had hoped for an exhibition from Greece for some time. While the selection of objects from as many as 14 Greek museums was essentially made by the Greek authorities and curators of the Louvre, the offering of the loan exhibition to the Museum necessitated several trips to Greece and to Paris by the Chairman. Joan Mertens, Asso- ciate Curator, and James Draper of the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts are mounting an exhibition to open in the National Pinakothek in Athens, Under the Classical Spell, and wrote the catalogue for it. At the same time the catalogue of Greek Art of the Aegean Islands was adapted for the New York showing by the Chairman and the Associate Curator from the French exhibition Mer Egée -Grèce des Iles that had been pre- pared by the Département des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines of the Louvre under the editorship of Alain Pasquier and Francois Villard. This past winter the Catalogue of Roman Sarcophagi written by Anna Marguerite McCann, former Research Associate of the department, was published by the Mu- seum. The Chairman and the Associate Curator con- White-ground and red-figured kylix, Attick, ca. 470 B.C.; Classical Purchase and Rogers Funds. 33</page><page sequence="19">tinued an active program of various articles and book reviews. The Chairman lectured on Euphronios in Moscow and Leningrad, on Sarpedon at the Hudson Valley Community College, and participated in a Mu- seum Training program at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. He also conducted a seminar on non-Attic red-figured vases for the Institute. The purchases of the year were particularly impor- tant for the collection of Attic vases by archaic red-figure masters. A kylix signed by Epiktetos, found at the Prince de Caninos excavations in Vulci in December 1828 and lost from view since 1865 following the sale of the Pour- talès-Gorgier collection, was bought with the gift of Leon Levy. Two fragmentary cups by Makron and a fragmen- tary cup by Douris were acquired with the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Martin Fried. The Museum was also fortunate in acquiring a superb early classic kylix by the Villa Giulia Painter. The full tondo of the inside is painted in outline on white ground. A goddess is shown sacrificing at an altar. On the outside Eos (on the obverse) is pursuing Tithonos (on the reverse). Among the gifts received by the department, most notable are an Attic red-figured lekythos by the Provi- dence Painter showing a wingless Nike the gift of Mr. and Mrs. A. M. Adler and a rare Hellenistic pyxis given by Mme. Politis in memory of her husband, Athanase G. Politis, Ambassador of Greece to the United States.

However, the legacy of his ten years as the departments Consultative Chairman is rich beyond measure. The imprint he left on the department will insure the perpetuation of his ideals; and the standard of excellence he set for those with whom he worked will hopefully serve as a model to all who come after him. This year the department began the job of installing as many as possible of the objects not on exhibition. When this project - made possible by a generous grant from The Hagop Kevorkian Fund- is completed, these objects will be easily accessible in storage drawers within the galleries. The 15th century Spanish ceiling given to the department in 1977 was installed in the Islamic entrance gallery thanks to another grant from The Hagop Kev- orkian Fund. Various members of the staff have continued their lecturing and publication activities. Marie Swietochowski lectured at The Textile Museum, Washington, D.C. and Manuel Keene gave a lecture to the New York Rug So- ciety. The Associate Curator Acting-in-Charge read lec- tures in Valbonne, France at an international colloquium on medieval Mediterranean ceramics, at the Third Con- ference of Islamic Art Historians of North America at the University of Michigan and at the University of Wiscon- sin. In addition, each of the above-mentioned staff mem- bers gave several gallery talks and Marie Swietochowski taught one course at Columbia University. Members of the staff were also involved in a number of publication projects. Richard Ettinghausen and Marie Swietochowski wrote the Autumn Bulletin on Islamic painting. The Associate Curator Acting-in-Charge and Manuel Keene contributed an article on the history of Islamic jewelry to the Encyclopaedia of Islam and are cur- rently working on a booklet of the Museums Islamic jewelry collection, a publication sponsored by a grant from The Hagop Kevorkian Fund. Richard Ettinghausen had two articles published and submitted two others, and the Associate Curator Acting-in-Charge submitted three articles in addition to that mentioned above. Marie Swietochowski traveled in Turkey and Lebanon and Manuel Keene spent two months in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Egypt, under the auspices of the Museum and The Hagop Kevorkian Fund, researching his forthcoming book on the history of infinite-repetition geometric patterns. Carolyn Kane was a member of the New York University archaeological expedition to Mendes in the Nile Delta. The Associate Curator Acting- in-Charge made three trips to the Middle East for re- search and consultation. The department made a number of outstanding ac- quisitions. In addition to those discussed in Notable Ac- quisitions, 1975-1979, the generosity of a number of "Lakabi" ceramic dish, Syria, second half of the 12th century; Pur- chase, Richard Ettinghausen Memorial Fund. individuals enabled the department to acquire five ob- jects in memory of Richard Ettinghausen: three excep- tionally fine 11th century pieces of gold Fatimid Egyptian jewelry; a 12th century Persian lakabi bowl; and a 16th century Ottoman Turkish miniature. Those who contrib- uted were Lewis Balamuth, Edwin Binney 3rd, Mrs. Pierre David- Weill, Mrs. Benjamin E. Grey, Mrs. Samuel B. Grimson, Jasim Homaizi, Arthur A. Houghton, Jr., Charles D. Kelekian, Prince Amyn Aga Khan, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, Mrs. Joseph McMullan, Alvin W. Pearson, Richard Perkins, Mrs. James J. Rorimer, Nor- bert Schimmel, Louis E. Seley, the Edward and Mary Warburg Fund and Ehsan Yarshater. The department received a partial share of an ex- tremely important 16th century Herat carpet given by Louis E., Theresa S. and Hervey Seley; and a number of rare medieval Islamic objects from Egypt given in mem- ory of Michel Abemayor. Dr. Ettinghausen gave three objects, including an important 8th-9th century molded and glazed ceramic ewer from Iran or Iraq. The department continues to benefit from the inval- uable help of its volunteer, Zdenka Munzer.

Madina Jasim Y Homaizi The integration of the Robert Lehman Collection into the Museum's activities progressed markedly this year. Several hundred paintings, drawings and objects of deco- rative arts were accessioned. In addition, new depart- mental files, catalogue cards and negative numbers were prepared for the newly accessioned items. This work provides appropriate records for other departments of the Museum such as Catalogue, Conservation and the Photograph and Slide Library. In continuation of the conservation program begun in 1977, almost every painting on exhibition received initial treatment and cleaning. The full-scale restoration of Giovanni di Paolo's important and large Coronation of the Virgin was completed with excellent results; several other paintings are also receiving extensive treatment. The systematic conservation work of the drawings was begun this year, with concentration on those included in various exhibitions. Three exhibitions were presented in our drawings galleries. During the summer of 1978, Images of Women included close to 100 drawings and watercolors on this subject; all the drawings came from the collection's hold- ings. XV-XVI Century Northern Drawings, and XVI Century Italian Drawings were shown in the fall of 1978 and spring of 1979 as part of our program of comprehensive exhibi- tions of drawings from the collection. Both exhibitions 36</page><page sequence="22">MEDIEVAL ART included related objects of decorative arts such as sculp- ture, glass, jewelry and furniture. Our rich holdings provided several loans to impor- tant exhibitions both at home and abroad. Among the most notable were the loans of a pair of bronzes to the Giambologna exhibition in Edinburgh, London and Vienna, of several drawings to the successful Fragonard exhibition in Washington, Cambridge and New York and of objects to exhibitions in Paris and Cleveland. The Curator continued teaching as Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Institute of Medieval and Renais- sance Studies at the City College of the City University of New York. He delivered several papers on medieval gold- smithwork and fountains at the Cleveland Museum of Art and at Dumbarton Oaks, and gave lectures at the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., as well as at various colleges and at the Museum. Staff members collaborated on the production of two catalogues, XV-XVI Century Northern Drawings, and XVI Century Italian Drawings and several other Museum publications. George Szabo Curator Giovanni di Paolo, Sienese, born 1403?, died 1482-83, Coronation of the Virgin, tempera on panel. The present year has been fairly quiet for our depart- ment as compared to the previous year. The Early Christian-Byzantine-Migration gallery has been re- installed by Margaret Frazer and Katharine Brown un- der the supervision of the Curator. The staff organized several loan exhibitions and lectured at the Roberson Center for the Arts and Sciences in Binghamton, New York and at the Yellowstone Art Center in Billings, Mon- tana in connection with loan exhibitions. The latter was an exciting experience enabling the Curator to view the impact that the small effort of preparing a loan can have on a community eager to see and learn. Our program of apprentices, undergraduate and graduate summer interns and special grant fellows went as smoothly and as successfully as in previous years. Though we cannot name all because of lack of space, special mention should be made of Rebecca Martin of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who spent four months with us on a grant from her alma mater and did a splendid and publishable work on two of our tapes- tries. Margaret Frazer and Katharine Brown wrote articles to appear in the fall issue of Gesta dedicated to The Age of Spirituality and attended the 4th Annual Conference of Ivory Corpus of Christ, French (probably Paris), ca. 1230-1250; Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Maxime L.

Mrs. Frazer also served as Co-Chairman of the Grants Committee, Chairman of the Library Committee, representative of the Curatorial Forum to the Board of Trustees and member of the Professional Committee of the Forum. Katharine Brown reorganized and did a number of reattributions of our collection of Migration, Byzantine and Western Decora- tive arts off exhibition, assisted by an undergraduate intern. She wrote a review of a symposium, two other articles and the text for a possible booklet on barbarian jewelry at the Metropolitan. Charles Little collaborated in an international con- ference on Gothic ivories held at the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore and at the Metropolitan in July 1978 and at the British and Victoria and Albert Museums, London and the Louvre and Cluny in Paris in June 1979. He wrote an article on some of his conclusions to be published in Revue de VArt. In the fall he gave a lecture course on Gothic sculpture at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York Univer- sity. He continued supervision of the Treasures of Irish Art to its conclusion and coordinated a forthcoming exhibi- tion about the Vikings in conjunction with the British Museum. Margaret Frazer, Charles Little and the Cura- tor wrote contributions for the new accessions volume. Barbara Boehm did a demonstration of tapestry weaving at The Cloisters Festival. The structure of both the Medieval Department and The Cloisters will be changed due to the appointment of William D. Wixom, an old friend and colleague of many years, as Chairman for both departments. We all look forward to a productive co-existence. The new Chairman is now working with Charles Little and myself in the preparation of an exhibition of some recently found heads and torsos from the Cathedral of Notre Dame. The Curator went to Paris in connection with this exhibition and wrote the text for an illustrated booklet. Last, but by no means least, we have received some important gifts and the announcement of two bequests. Among the gifts, the most outstanding is a French Gothic ivory Corpus that is an important addition to our already excellent collection of ivories. To Mr. and Mrs. Maxime L. Hermanos, theBlumka Gallery, Mr. and Mrs. Charles D Kelekian and those who remain anonymous goes our deep gratitude for their generosity.

In addition to the popular Sunday after- noon concerts, a series of gallery programs were pre- sented on 25 Saturday afternoons, including six demon- stration recitals on an early 17th century positive organ of South German monastic origin, recently purchased by the Department of Musical Instruments; 18 perfor- mances of two medieval ex-cathedra dramas, the Play of Pharaoh from the Wakefleld Cycle and the Play of Adam and Eve from the Lincoln Cycle; demonstrations of both tapestry weaving and stained glass making; as well as lecture tours of the herb garden.

These include an Italian marble altarpiece dated 1434 and signed by Andrea da Giona, as well as a fine Spanish retable, on loan from the Depart- ment of European Paintings, representing All Saints and the Civitate dei commissioned by the Cervello family for the Monastery of Vail de Christo. The cleaning and restoration of four important pieces of sculpture was carried out by Rudolf Meyer, Master Restorer. Under the direction of Nobuko Ka- jitani, Conservator, the Department of Textile Con- servation made large strides in the restoration of the Burgos Tapestry and on three fragments of the Heroes Tapestries. The Cloisters continued its active loan program. Most notable was the loan of Hector from the Heroes Tapestries, the Prayerbook and the Hours of Bonne of Luxembourg and the bust of Juliana to an exhibition organized by the Schnütgen Museum in Cologne. Addi- tional loans went to the Yellowstone Art Gallery in Bill- ings, Montana and the Kaiserburg in Nuremberg, West Germany. The library was augmented by the accession of 188 titles, while some 2,000 slides were added to the slide collection. A gift of Victoria Blumka has enabled the library to purchase the Marburg Index of 500,000 photo- graphs on 5,000 microfiches. The Mathis-Pfohl Founda- tion donated $1,000 which was used to purchase the Archives de la Commission des Monuments Historiques (Paris, 1898-1903). The Education Department, with support from the National Endowment for the Arts, sponsored workshops in preparation for the annual medieval festival. The fes- tival, held each August, attracted approximately 12,000 people and received national publicity. Also well attended were classes in stained glass, tapestry weaving and man- uscript illumination. 1,215 high school students partici- pated in "A Day at The Cloisters", combination gallery talks and workshop programs. Volunteers provided these and other tours to 8,220 elementary school children. Staff lecturers toured 380 groups, of all ages. The workshop also provided the facilities used by Jane Hayward to organize a master class in stained glass making. The group created two large-scale windows for the new chapel of Stonehill College in North Easton, Mass., employing techniques used by medieval artisans. Dr. Hayward also chaired the symposium on medieval stained glass held at Harvard, and delivered a lecture at Columbia University on Saint-Urbain at Troyes. The Ad- ministrator received a Museum Travel Grant to research the 14th century tombs of the Counts of Urgel, in the Gothic Chapel, and their place in the Léridan School of sculpture in preparation for a monograph. The collections were enriched by two sections of a stained glass border, possibly from the Abbey Church of St. Remi at Reims, and a rare, late medieval ironwork crémaillère or trammel hook of French or Spanish work- manship, given by Andrew J. Werner. Timothy Husband Administrator Departmental Accessions Gifts Crémaillère or Trammel Hook; wrought iron; Central or Southern France or Northern Spain, 15th or 16th C; 1978.398; Andrew J.

Basic research and cataloguing, principally in the areas of Western and native American instruments, accounted for a major share of the department's activity in 1978-79. A continuing grant from the National Endowment for the Arts supported cataloguers Nancy Crutcher and Helen Hubbard Marr, whose work over several years has greatly increased our knowledge of this vast collection. The results of the cataloguing project, expressed in sev- eral checklists and articles published during the year, helped define long-term acquisition and restoration goals. Nancy Groce, an Andrew W. Mellon Fellow in the department, spent her year compiling valuable informa- tion on New York instrument makers, while Bo Law- ergren, a J. Clawson Mills Fellow, pursued studies in musical acoustics. Deborah Autorino was awarded a graduate assistantship for summer research in the collec- tion. The department head received travel grants from the Catherine Lorillard Wolfe Art Club and through the National Museum Act. He also served as program chair- man for the 1979 meeting of the American Musical In- strument Society, of which he is a director; taught a graduate seminar at CCNY's Institute for Medieval and 39</page><page sequence="25">Renaissance Studies and lectured at the Aston Magna Academy and elsewhere. Stewart Pollens, Senior Re- storer, chaired a panel at the American Musical Instru- ment Society meeting at the University of Chicago and lectured at the University of Michigan. As always, the department received many visiting musicians and provided rare instruments for their per- formances and recordings in the Museum. A gala concert in November presented recently acquired baroque in- struments, heard in ensemble and recorded for the first time on that occasion. A Javanese gamelan given by the Bratman family was played here in May by Cornell Uni- versity students; the gamelan is on loan to that school. Our German baroque pipe organ was heard in six well-at- tended programs at The Cloisters. Since musical perfor- mances offer the best means of interpreting and sharing our collection, the department continued to seek support for a regular, expanded schedule of public concerts and demonstrations. When gallery activities were curtailed by the Tutankhamun show, we took the opportunity to im- prove our gallery installations and to revise our popular recorded tour. Among the year's noteworthy acquisitions was a Flor- entine violin by Lorenzo Carcassi (1752), the second fine violin given by Evelyn Stark. This was followed by Doro- thy and Robert Rosenbaum's gift of a much-needed Eng- lish viola by Benjamin Banks (1791). In an effort to strengthen representation of American instruments we purchased a piano by Dodds &amp; Claus, a pioneering New York firm patronized by George Washington, and the oldest extant American hammer dulcimer (ca. 1815-20), which once served as a hen roost in an Ohio barn. A Viennese piano by the noted maker Johann Jacob Seydel (1792) makes an interesting companion to the contempo- rary Dodds &amp; Claus instrument. Two unusual harps from the collection of Mildred Dilling, doyenne of harpists, en- riched this area of the collection; they testify to the inter- est professional musicians take in our collection. Recording is one aspect of publication uniquely im- portant to this department, and in the past year the Museum produced two successful records, both includ- ing performances by Mieczyslaw Horszowski on our 1720 Cristofori piano. Critical praise of our musical activities and publications, and the department's unusually high level of grant support, reflect the collection's growing role as a center for musical scholarship.

Lender to the Department Thomas J. Hayes A great loss was sustained in the death of Nelson A. Rockefeller, for decades a pioneer in the field of primitive art. As a collector he amassed perhaps the most impor- tant large group of works ever in private hands; as Founder and President of The Museum of Primitive Art he advanced the exhibition and study of the subject; and in the truest expression of his public spirit he was the moving force in the foundation of the Michael C. Rock- efeller Wing in which the department and its collections will be housed. His active interest in and concern with the details of the plans for the project continued to the last. He presented much of his collection to the Metropolitan Museum in his lifetime, and this magnificent gift has now been completed by bequest. Within the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, work is proceeding rapidly. Detailed drawings for the allotment and placement of individual works in the cases are being prepared. These drawings will serve as an essential mas- ter guide for the actual process of installing the works in their final settings. With the aid of additional specialized staff, the Con- sevation Department has launched a large scale program for the exacting task of examining, cleaning and readying for display the approximately 2,800 works which will be on view. A planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities enabled the department and the Design Department, in consultation with the Education Depart- ments, to explore in-depth solutions for specific installa- tion problems and methods of information retrieval for the Wing. Much advice was given by Philip Dark and the late Peter Goldmark, among other consultants who were retained. Generous gifts of objects were received from a num- ber of donors, especially Arthur M. Bullowa, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Lichter and Nathaniel Spear, Jr. Purchases included an important Songye fetish figure and archaic Eskimo ivories. The department made a substantial loan to Moche Art of Peru, an exhibition organized by the Mu- seum of Cultural History of the University of California at Los Angeles, and also shown in Phoenix and Denver. The catalogue illustrated many of our objects. Loans also were made to the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim Museum and other institutions. An important loan was received from Frederick E. Landmann. Both Julie Jones, Curator, and Susan Vogel, Associ- ate Curator, continued work towards the integration of the Rockefeller collections and The Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art collections. Julie Jones lectured at The De- troit Institute of Arts and the Center for Inter- American Relations in New York. With the aid of a Museum travel grant, she visited Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador 41</page><page sequence="27">and Peru to review museum collections. Susan Vogel visited Madagascar to see traditional funerary art, and South Africa and Lesotho to photograph bushman rock paintings. During the course of the year she lectured at the New Orleans Museum of Art, the St. Louis Art Mu- seum, Princeton University and at the offices of NBC for the Museums Public Education Department. She also delivered papers at professional meetings at the Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C., Columbia University, the Fogg Museum and the University of Iowa. Allan Chapman, Librarian, served on the board of the Museum Computer Network as Treasurer, as in previous years. The continued volunteer services of Carol Meyer and Dorothy Lytle to the photo collection of the library and departmental archives, respectively, have been of great assistance. It is gratifying that, in spite of being housed in tem- porary quarters, the Robert Goldwater Library has been able to accommodate a growing use by the staff of the Museum. It has also received gifts from Carol Meyer, Tobias Schneebaum, Philip Dark, Herbert Baker and the World Wildlife Fund among others.

Lenders to the Department Frederick E. Landmann Mrs. Bertram Smith Construction of new galleries, offices, storage areas and a Print Study Room is underway. The staff has devoted considerable time to planning the new facilities which are expected to be completed early in 1980. Although our study room and most of the gallery space formerly occupied have had to be closed due to the building project, we have maintained a schedule of loans to other institutions while managing six exhibitions this past year. On the balcony of the Blumenthal Patio we showed Abraham Bosse Reports on the France of Louis XIII (organized by Janet S. Byrne), The Print Collector in the Kitchen (guest curated by Phyllis D. Massar), Egyptomania (selected by David W. Kiehl) and Rembrandt and the Bible, which was the subject of a Museum5w/to written by A. Hyatt Mayor, Curator Emeritus. In other galleries, Avedon Photographs 1947-1977 and Georgia O'Keeffe: A Por- trait by Alfred Stieglitz (supervised by Weston J. Naef) were shown. The latter celebrated the publication of a superb volume of facsimiles of Stieglitz's photographs, with text by Miss O'Keeffe. At the Grolier Club, the Curator in Charge organized an exhibition of Prized Prints with Riva Castleman, print curator at the Museum of Modern Art, and lectured on the important collectors who helped establish the Metropolitan Museum's print collection. This was an especially rewarding year because gifts to the department were many; we received over 1,000 items from 80 donors. Particularly noteworthy among these gifts are two splendid etchings by G.B. Castiglione from Robert L. Manning and Bertina Suida Manning, a charming design for a gold box by Louis Felix de la Rue from Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, Rembrandt's Stoning of St. Stephen from Bert Freidus, prints by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg from Joseph Singer and gifts of purchase funds from Mrs. Carl Stern, the Charles Z. Offin Art Fund and Warner Communications Inc. Outstanding among the year's purchases are a rare etch- ing after Giulio Romano by Pierre Biard Le Jeune, Psyche Presenting Flowers to her Envious Sisters, Cornelius van Kit- tensteyn's engraving of Sight, from a set of the Five Senses, after Dirck Hals, and an extremely beautiful proof of Regnault's engraving of La Fontaine d'Amour by Jean Honoré Fragonard. The curatorial staff has participated in a variety of activities. Mary Myers lectured on Piranesi at the Cooper- Hewitt Museum; Weston Naef delivered talks on the Alfred Stieglitz Collection in Vienna, Cologne and at Pennsylvania State University; Suzanne Boorsch contrib- uted articles on contemporary prints to the Print Collec- tor's Newsletter and Art News; David Kiehl published an essay on "American Monotypes" in Art and Commerce: Sight, from a series of the Five Senses, engraving by Cornelius vai Kittensteyn, Netherlandish, ca. 1600-after 1638; The Elisha Whittel sey Collection, The Elisha Whittelsey Fund. 43</page><page sequence="29">American Prints of the Nineteenth Century, Boston, 1978. The Curator in Charge participated in the Museum training classes of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University and sat on juries for the print competitions of the Na- tional Arts Club, New York and the Bienal of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Along with Janet Byrne and Mary Myers, she attended the Philadelphia meeting of the Print Coun- cil of America, of which she is a board member.

Christophe de Menil Gift. During this last year, in addition to preliminary planning for the Clyfford Still exhibition which will open in November 1979, the Twentieth Century Art Department installed a summer loan exhibition which had been initi- ated by Thomas Hess, the late Consultative Chairman. The staff also organized a tribute to Robert Beverly Hale which surveyed the acquisitions made by the first curator of American Art during his tenure here at the Museum. Cynthia Goodman completed an exhibition of drawings by students of Hans Hofmann. This exhibition was com- prised of loans and gifts to the department from the artists, former students of Hofmann and their friends. In April of this year the department opened an exhibition of recent wall pieces and paintings by Ellsworth Kelly. It included large scale monochrome, shaped canvases, metal wall sculptures and a separate series of black / grey /white paintings. The department staff also organized an exhibition, Selected Works by Black Artists from the Collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for the Arsenal Gallery of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in connection with the celebration of February as Black History Month. We have been encouraged by the generosity of many individuals this year, and their support has served to sustain the department during this period of transition. Among the numerous gifts we received this year are Coarse Shadow by Kenneth Noland from Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Schwartz, La Ville Antique by Paul Delvaux from Julian Aberbach and Sleeping Nude by Othon Friesz from Himan Brown. Several gifts from artists have also en- riched our collection. These include Alex Katz's gift of his portrait by Philip Pearlstein, Larry Rivers' gift of his Poem Portrait of John Ashbery and Hale Woodruffs charcoal drawing from his Torso series. Jim Dine gave us a drawing by Jasper Johns, Sketch for Good Time Charley, and another artist, who wishes to remain anonymous, donated sculp- tures by Willard Boepple and Alexander Lieberman, paintings by Robert Goodnough and Robert Kulicke and a drawing for a sculpture by David Smith. Mrs. Fairfield Porter donated works by her husband, Portrait of Elaine de Kooning, Sunset with Tablecloth and drawings that were studies for Near Union Square and Sunrise on South Main Street both of which are already in our collection. Departmental purchases included a collage study for David Smith's Becca (which is in the collection of the department), a recent painting, Leah's Renoir by Sam Gilliam and a coronation spoon for Edward VII by Archi- bald Knox with funds donated by Andrew Crispo. Gate- way, a wood sculpture by Dorothy Dehner, was purchased with funds from Jo Anne and Norman M. Schneider. Our Decorative Arts Gallery has been refurbished by Penelope Hunter-Stiebel to feature a dressing table-sink by Louis Majorelle given by The Sydney and Frances Lewis Foundation, and an elevator cab from the Interna- tional Building in Rockefeller Center given jointly by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Rockefeller Cen- ter, Inc. Other contributions to our Decorative Arts col- lection included Inevitable Interaction, a tapestry by Jan Yoors donated in his memory by his family. The Associate Curator, Acting-in-Charge, was as- sisted in maintaining the department by Susan Levé, Departmental Assistant, Mary Lorincz, Departmental Secretary, and Ida Balboul, Research Assistant, who is responsible for the cataloguing and inventory of the col- lection. Ruth Kaufman has continued work on a cata- logue of our Stieglitz collection with publication and exhibition planned two years hence. The Associate Cura- tor published articles in the Women s Art Journal, Arts Can- ada, installed an exhibition Santos and wrote a catalogue for an exhibition of paintings by Domingo Garcia at El Museo del Barrio. She juried exhibitions for the Allen- town Art Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art and continued to serve on both the Museum panel of the New York State Council on the Arts and a panel for the Na- tional Endowment for the Arts. She also conducted ses- sions on curatorship for the New School for Social Research and the Art Department at City College.
