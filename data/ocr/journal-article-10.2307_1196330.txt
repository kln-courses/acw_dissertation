Using the Lord's Prayer as a basis, the author gives a meditation for each day in Lent. The prayer reveals much of the nature and purpose of God, and the author gives many penetrating insights into it.-ROLLAND W. SCHLOERB. ALEXANDER, HARTLEY BURR. God and Man's Destiny. New York: Oxford University Press, 1936. 248 pages. $2.50. This is a collection of essays and addresses prepared for diverse occasions and of rather divergent character. The essay on "Drama as Cosmic Truth" is a trenchant presentation of a salient trend of current thought which perhaps no one has hitherto expressed so vividly. The author's style is sometimes extraordinary. "The whiteness of sanity" is a sample of the tendency toward extravagant metaphor. This and the per- sistent employment of word-orders contrary to ordinary usage produce an effect some- times finely poetic, sometimes merely irritating. The thought similarly oscillates in value. The contentions-that drama is a cosmic category, that God suffers and strug- gles for his creatures, and that time, as involving open possibilities for the future, is real even in application to God-are well supported by the reasons given. Alexander says frankly that an "anthropomorphic theology" is the only convincing one. But then (as a professed anti-intellectualist might be expected to do) he confuses the issue by unnecessary cloudiness or ambiguity at certain points. He says the temporal character of existence is necessary to its "exposition" but not to its "understood reality." And he praises Dante for holding the idea of an eternal in which "every where and every when is focused." This at least sounds like the Thomistic totum simul which anthro- pomorphic or temporalistic theology has been gaining courage to discard. On the other hand, the author falls, or seems to fall, into the opposite pitfall of an unjustified or narrow type of anthropomorphism when he appears to follow Berkeley in holding that "human personality is the essential ground of any reality we men can know." As Leibniz, Ward, Whitehead, and many others have shown, this type of subjectivism is quite unnecessary, indeed hostile, to a genuinely dramatic view of reality. Again, Professor Alexander's account of the mind-body relation makes no use of the dis- coveries of science-to which he himself refers in another connection-according to which the world contains myriads of vastly subhuman dramatic agents (e.g., cells). He, or his terminology at least, oscillates between subjective idealism and medieval dualism, and overlooks the panpsychic "philosophy of organism" which appears to fit his own purposes better than either. The best of this book is very good indeed. It shows a rare appreciation of the intui- tive or integral factor in understanding. A frankly and richly intuitive philosophy is perhaps somewhat nearer to the ideal of philosophy than the formalistic positivism which evades or dismisses most of the questions which lead men to philosophize. Since the Platos who can achieve the highest insights and the sharpest formal analyses are so rare, there will always be a need for men who can do justice to at least one of these objectives.-CHARLES HARTSHORNE. 357</page></plain_text>
