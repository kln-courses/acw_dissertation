<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent research on the Tiwanaku state has documented the evolution of regional settlement patterns and agricultural systems, but little is known of changes at the subregional level outside the capital. Analysis of a sequence of domestic occupations excavated at Lukurmata, Bolivia, provides information on how individual households within the Tiwanaku core area were consolidated into the Tiwanaku polity. Changes in residential patterns and artifact assemblages suggest that Lukurmata households were initially connected to the Tiwanaku polity through exchange and religious ties. A new level of assimilation developed in the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. These changes, including agricultural intensification, illustrate the increas- ing integration of individual households into the Tiwanaku political economy and social order as the landscape developed. The nature and timing of these changes are consistent with current hypotheses of a transformation in Tiwanaku political and economic organization near the end of the Tiwanaku IV period (A.D. 400-800). Recientes investigaciones referidas al estado Tiwanaku han documentado la evolucion tanto de los patrones de asentamiento a nivel regional como de los sistemas agrEcolas, aunque poco se sabe de los cambios a nivel local y sub-regionalfuera de la capital. El analisis de una secuencia de ocupaciones dome'sticas excavadas en Lukurmata, Bolivia, provee informacion de como las unidades dome'sticas dentro del area nuclear de Tiwanaku fueron consolidadas dentro de la entidad polftica Tiwanaku. Cambios en los patrones residenciales y conjuntos de artefactos sugieren que los vfnculos iniciales de las unidades dome'sticas con Tiwanaku fueron de caracter lim itado e indirecto. Esto se man ifiesta principalmente en la adopcion de l estilo Tiwanaku en vasijas de servicio y usadas en rituales dome'sticos. Un nuevo nivel de asimilacion se desarrolla en los siglos o ctavo y n oveno d. C. Estos cambios, incluyendo la in tensificacion de la p rodu ccion agrEco la, ilustran la c re cien te in tegrac ion de las unidades dome'sticas individuales a la economfa polftica y orden social de Tiwanaku, mientras la region se desarro- llaba como un a'rea especializada de sostentacion urbana. El tiempo y naturaleza de estos cambios son congruentes con las actuales hipotesis de transformacion de la organizacion polftica y econo'mica del estado Tiwanaku acaecidas a fines del perfodo Tiwanaku I V (S00-900 d. C. ). Marc Bermann * Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 Latin American Antiquity, 8(2), 1997, pp. 93-112. Copyright C) by the Society for American Archaeology I nterest in the internal organization of the Prehispanic Andean states has rapidly evolved during the last several years. Archaeological and ethnohistoric studies are documenting both the diversity in indigenous modes of sociopoliti- cal organization and the flexible character of Prehispanic Andean imperialism (D'Altroy 1992; Malpass 1993; Morris 1987; Schreiber 1992). These studies underscore the need for archaeolo- gists to examine closely the ways in which con- stituent social units ranging from households to ethnic groups-were incorporated into larger sociopolitical formations. Recent investigations of domestic organization in the Prehispanic Andes have explored in depth how households in provincial and peripheral populations were con- solidated into imperial political systems (D'Altroy 1992; Hastorf 1993; Schreiber 1992). There has been less study of communities in core regions, how these communities were initially drawn into such polities, and how societal inte- gration changed as the overarching polity grew. Study of basal integrative processes is particu- larly relevant for the Tiwanaku polity that domi- nated the south-central Andes between A.D. 400 to 1200. The nature of the Tiwanaku polity has long been the subject of debate, interpreted at var- ious times as an "ideoeconomic interaction sphere" (Wallace 1980); a mercantile confedera- tion of demographic centers (Browman 1981); a theocratic center (Schaedel 1988:773); a power- ful, centralized conquest state (Kolata 1992, 93 DOMESTIC LIFE AND VERTICAL INTEGRATION IN THE TIWANAKU HEARTLAND Marc Berrnann l ^ l [ l l l -</page><page sequence="2">94 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 8, No. 2, 1997 Figure 1.

This debate, until a decade ago, revolved around interpretations of the regional distribution of Tiwanaku-style materials outside the Tiwanaku heartland. More recently, systematic investigation has centered on reconstructing regional settle- ment and economic processes within the Tiwanaku core (Albarracin-Jordan and Mathews 1990; Kolata 1992, 1993). This research has shed light on various aspects of the politico-economic organization of the Tiwanaku polity, particularly those relating to the agrarian sustenance of an urban capital (Kolata 1992, 1993). There has been little investigation, however, of economic patterns and social processes at the household and com- munity level at other sites in the core area. Virtually nothing is known about how individual families outside the capital were connected to, or affected by, the Tiwanaku polity. As a result, cur- rently proposed reconstructions of local organiza- tion in the Tiwanaku heartland are largely hypothetical, based on ethnographic analogy rather than archaeological data. This paper reviews household-level changes in ritual activities, social organization, and eco- nomic patterns as revealed by a long sequence of Lukurmata, Bolivia, as that site was absorbed into the Tiwanaku polity. The domestic and com- munity changes at Lukurmata provide a "win- dow" on the consolidation of the core's population into the Tiwanaku exchange network, ceremonial sphere, settlement hierarchy, and political economy. Given the limited sample size, only cautious conclusions can be drawn from the Lukurmata investigations, but the patterns that emerge have implications for understanding larger processes of vertical integration in the Tiwanaku heartland. The Tiwanaku Heartland Settlement during the Formative period (1200 B.C.-A.D. 100), in what became the Tiwanaku heartland, took the form of small, autonomous villages, with economies based on tuber and chenopod agriculture, camelid pastoralism, and exploitation of lacustrine resources (Albarracin- Jordan 1992). The only public architecture securely dated to this period is the sunken temple complex at Chiripa on the Taraco Peninsula. Nothing can be said of settlement patterns during the following Tiwanaku III period (A.D. 10W500) because of problems with the existing ceramic chronology, although the site of</page><page sequence="3">Bermann] DOMESTIC LIFE IN THE TIWANAKU HEARTLAND 95 Tiwanaku grew from a small village to a large public architecture center during this time (Ponce Sangines 1980, 1981). By the eighth century A.D., Tiwanaku covered 420 ha, with a residential population estimated at 30,000 40,000 (Kolata 1993; Ponce Sangines 1980). The Tiwanaku polity dominated the Lake Titicaca Basin, and established colonial and trade ties extending from the Pacific coasts of Peru and Chile across the eastern slopes of the Andes. Developments in the Tiwanaku heartland (the Tiwanaku Valley, Rio Desaguadero drainage, and the Pampa Koani/Rio Catari drainage) (Figure 1) included population growth and nucleation, construction of an extensive raised- field landscape fed by aqueducts and canals, and the emergence of a primoconvex regional settle- ment hierarchy, with Tiwanaku at the apex and a handful of smaller public architecture sites including Lukurmata, Pajchiri, Khonko Wankane, Chiripa, Iwawe, and Kallamarka as subsidiary centers (Kolata 1992, 1993; McAndrews et al. 1996). Complex settlement hierarchy disappeared from the heartland area with the collapse of the Tiwanaku polity and the virtual abandonment of Tiwanaku at the end of the Tiwanaku V period (A.D. 900-1200). The population was dispersed into small sites during the subsequent Pacajes period (A.D. 120s1475) (Albarracin-Jordan and Mathews 1990; Graffam 1992:896; Kolata 1992:296). Household-Center Relations in Complex Societies All complex polities possess vertical integration: relationships and processes that link constituent households to the political center and its ruling institutions. Understanding this vertical integra- tion requires discovering the "minimal activities, beliefs, relationships and institutions," that link societal components (Shils 1982:8). From the household perspective, these integrative ties may vary in nature, intensity, and degree of directness. The Nature of Vertical Ties Connections between individual households and supralocal institutions can be divided into the familiar categories of political, economic, social, and ideological, recognizing that these are rarely separate domains. Political ties ranging from vol- untary affiliation to formal authority were couched in kinship structures, social hierarchy, and ethnic identity in the Prehispanic Andean states. In general, individual commoner house- holds can be linked to a political center through a variety of economic ties, ranging from occasional participation in a capital-centered market or trade system to inclusion in the type of well-defined tribute structure that characterized the Inka empire. The social assimilation of individual house- holds into a capital-centered social system will also vary widely, within and among local popula- tions. In cases of full assimilation, all households of a local population might be incorporated into a state-level status order of uniform status cate- gories and material status markers. In other instances, particularly in cases of indirect rule, only local elites will be articulated with this sys- tem, connected to the capital through voluntary self-identification, and marriage, jural, or ceremo- nial ties (Costin and Earle 1989; D'Altroy 1992; Schreiber 1992). Thus, provincial elites in the Inka empire were linked to the Inka nobility through bureaucratic appointments, marriage and exchanges of women, honorary status, or Elctive ancestry (D'Altroy 1992; Julien 1982:125; La Lone 1992:27; Rowe 1982). Provincial elite households often adopted the rights, obligations, and sumptuary behavior appropriate to the noble estate, some even establishing residences in Cuzco or sending children there for enculturation (Earle and D'Altroy 1989:203; Parssinen 1992:162; Rowe 1982). Inclusion in the state status order should be marked by the adoption of stylistic preferences, architectural patterns, social practices, or ritual activities resembling those of the center. For example, following the Inka conquest of the northern Wanka of the Mantaro Valley, imperial Inka materials and stylistic canons replaced the local material markers that previously distin- guished commoners from elites (Costin and Earle 1989:702; D'Altroy 1992:213; Earle et al. 1987). Assimilation also may involve shifts in relative socioeconomic status, just as absorption into the Inka polity altered the socioeconomic status of commoner and elite households in the Wanka populations (D'Altroy 1992; Hastorf 1990,1993).</page><page sequence="4">96 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 Households also are generally consolidated into the larger polity through religious and ideological ties. Inka ideology served to legitimate political relationships of dominance and subordination, the pan-regional status order, and processes of eco- nomic mobilization (Earle and D'Altroy 1989). In a well-known example, the Inka state moved the main idols of subject populations to state shrines in Cuzco but left local cults intact, adding worship of Inti (Rowe 1982: 109). The Tiwanaku rulers engaged in a similar strategy of "huaca capture" (Kolata 1993: 142). As part of this cultural integra- tion, subject populations are likely to be linked to the center through the temple hierarchy character- istic of many state-level religions and through adoption at the household level of ritual associated with the central ideology and cosmology. Intensity Intensity refers to the strength of the household's articulation with central institutions. A measure of the intensity of integrative relationships is their effect on household organization, such as the extent to which the state political economy pene- trates the domestic realm. In intensive economic integration, demands from above for staple items or sumptuary goods can lead to a dramatic reorien- tation of the domestic economy. In less intensive integration, commoner households may be only loosely articulated with state-level structures and remain insulated from larger economic processes, contributing a negligible amount of labor or tribute (Redfield 1941; Smith 1994:144). Incorporation into the larger polity that mobilizes surplus outside the household domain might not alter domestic production patterns at all. The Inka economy, as an example, was once thought to have operated almost entirely outside the domestic sphere (Hastorf 1990; Murra 1982). However, careful studies of the effects of Inka conquest on Sausa households in the Mantaro Valley revealed sub- stantial Inka intervention in domestic production and consumption patterns (Hastorf 1990, 1993). Intensive vertical integration also may be seen in cultural homogeneity, as when activities, social practices, or stylistic preferences identified with the capital supplant local customs and local mate- rial status markers (Costin and Earle 1989; Earle and D'Altroy 1989:203). An example would be in the "Inkanization" of the local population around Hatunqolla, with the household adoption of Inka stylistic preferences and domestic and mortuary patterns (Julien 1983:250). In other instances, such as the Chupaychu population, and the Andamarca Lucanas group of the Carhuarazo Valley, Inka conquest led to significant disrup- tions of local life despite the absence of strong Inka influence on domestic material culture (Julien 1993:227; Schreiber 1993:113). In the Lluta Valley, Chile, as in other areas, incorpora- tion into the Inka polity was so indirect as to have had no appreciable impact on domestic life (Santoro 1995). Degree of Directness Interaction between central institutions and indi- vidual households also varies in degree of direct- ness. At one end of the Prehispanic spectrum were the Wari and Inka states. Current studies stress the extent to which the Inka goveIned through local authorities, but this should not obscure the remarkable degree to which individual families articulated with a highly centralized political economy, principally through state-run adminis- trative/production facilities (Earle and D'Altroy 1989; Schreiber 1992). In less centralized polities, and even within bureaucratic states, non-elite households might be separated from state-level bodies by many layers of regional political hierarchy, local economic institutions, and suprahousehold organizations. In the case of the Chupaychu ethnic group, Inka political ties to local families were indirect, with the Inka ruling through a hierarchy of local elites. Economic interaction with the Inka state was probably very direct, however, given the function of the nearby Huanuco Pampa administrative cen- ter. In contrast, economic integration of the Andamarca Lucanas population may have been equally intensive but much less direct because this group lay outside the range of a major Inka center. Functional Assessment of Vertical Integration Vertical integration was far from homogeneous or uniform in premodern polities. On close examina- tion, even the most unified premodern states dis- play significant heterogeneity in the integration and administration of subject populations. Nor do all forms of vertical integration incorporate the capital; at any one time, households may be part</page><page sequence="5">Bermann] DOMESTIC LIFE IN THE TIWANAKU HEARTLAND  of larger, noncentral supralocal and regional structures that have more effect on everyday life than relationships with the political capital (D'Altroy 1992; Mann 1986; Shils 1982). And finally, the degree of integration can vary widely, even among different social strata at a single site. This heterogeneity makes it particularly difficult archaeologically to distinguish economic demands by local elites from demands originating with central institutions. Given these problems, one of the most effective methods of identifying elements of vertical integration at the base of the societal pyramid is to monitor domestic changes as households are drawn into, and pass out of, clearly centralized polities. An ideal understanding of vertical integration lies in determining both household-center rela- tionships and the institutions in which these rela- tionships were embodied. To date, archaeologists have sought to reconstruct Tiwanaku political economy through analogy, or with reference to "perduring social principles" of "demonstrable antiquity and centrality in the autochthonous Andean world" (Kolata 1991:112). The domestic data from Lukurmata, however, require a different approach. A useful perspective is provided in Netherly's (1990: 179-180) distinction between "Jixnctions (such as administration, procurement of revenue, and direct production) and the institu- tions through which these were carried out" (ital- ics added). In monitoring prehistoric changes, a functional frame of reference is particularly valu- able when, as at Lukurmata, we cannot yet spec- ify the social units or institutions promoting or conducting particular functions. Lukurmata Occupation at Lukurmata began as early as the first century A.D. with the site remaining a small settlement through the Formative and Tiwanaku III periods. Settlement expanded to roughly 70 ha of residential occupation early in the Tiwanaku IV period, with a population of 3,000 to 6,000 (Bermann 1994; Stanish 1989). Intrasite complex- ity increased concurrently, with the development of discrete public architecture, mortuary, and resi- dential sectors. Lukurmata was largely abandoned during the Tiwanaku V period, and the Tiwanaku- style temple complex fell out of use (Bermann 1994). By the end of the Tiwanaku V period, 97 Lukurmata was once again a small settlement, and it remained so in the following Pacajes period. Excavations on a ridge west of Lukurmata's temple hilltop (Figure 2) exposed a series of superimposed domestic occupations (including housefloors and associated features) separated by artifact-bearing "fill" layers representing natural and cultural deposition (Bermann 1994). To avoid comparing a housefloor assemblage from one period to a midden assemblage of another, only those excavation lots classified in the field as "fill lots" are used in calculating frequency and den- sity indices. Fill lots are from nonmidden excava- tion contexts that lacked major features (hearths, pits, floors) and had an artifact density of 35s1200 m3. Individual fill lots cannot be asso- ciated with particular structures, but stratigraphic position and ceramic styles allowed us to group fill lots and domestic occupations into the six time units shown in Figure 3.1 The artifact counts used in the analysis are shown in Table 1. The low number of Tiwanaku V fill lots prevented their inclusion in the quantitative analysis. Changes in Residential Organization The architectural components of the Lukurmata ridge occupations have been described in detail elsewhere (Bermann 1990, 1994). Domestic struc- tures had earth or poured clay floors, mud-brick or cut-sod walls (sometimes set on stone footings), and thatch roofs. Household units from the Tiwanaku III and IV periods included two types of structures: dwellings and ancillary buildings used for less than the full range of household activities. Our sample size does not permit us to talk with confidence about changes in floor area, but among the structures we excavated, average size grew from the Formative (11.9 + 4.0 m2, n = 4), to the Tiwanaku III (18.0 + 6.0 m2, n = 6), and through the Tiwanaku IV periods (29.6 + 6.0 m2, n = 7). Tiwanaku IV households had significantly more internal storage pit space than Tiwanaku III house- holds with mean volumes per house of .78 + 2.5 m3 vs. .06 + .04 m3, respectively. The most striking change in residential spatial arrangement was the development of compact patio groupings after centuries of a pattern of dis- persed or single-structure household units. It is not clear when, in the Tiwanaku IV period, patio groupings appeared, but the patio arrangement is</page><page sequence="6">A.D. 1475 A.D. 1000 A.D. 500- 100 B.C.-  98 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2,1997 Figure 2.

The two excavated patio groups displayed similar size, feature types (hearths), and associ- ated artifacts (including large metates). Structures in each patio group contained hearths, storage pits, and the debris characteristic of a primary dwelling. However, at least one of the three struc- tures in each patio group lacked these attributes and may have been used primarily for storage. The patio organization at Lukurmata resem- bles the multiple household groupings recently found in Tiwanaku IV residential sectors at Tiwanaku (Janusek 1994; Kolata 1993). Excavations in two sectors (AKE1-M and AKE- 2) near the Akapana monument revealed patio groups consisting of two or more structures attached to an outdoor patio (Janusek 1994). As at Lukurmata, the patio structures displayed func- tional differentiation, with one room or structure in each group used primarily as a kitchen or stor- age area (Janusek 1994).

The multiple structures and hearths making up each patio group (at both Lukurmata and Tiwanaku) point to a residential unit larger than one nuclear family (a joint, composite, or extended family). Spatial patterning of features and artifacts argues that residents of the patio group shared storage facilities and some, but not all, pro- duction activities (Bermann 1994). As coresidency is a good general indicator of economic coopera- tion, this shift in household composition suggests that the patio group household played a new socioeconomic role, perhaps becoming an impor- tant corporate unit late in the Tiwanaku IV period.

Tool types from Lukurmata ffll lots: (a) wichuna (weaving tool), (b) camelid mandible tool, (c) chipped-stone often result from elite or central demands for goods and services (D'Altroy 1992; D'Altroy and Earle 1985). Shifts also can stem from participa- tion in a more complex and differentiated eco- nomic system, one that permits, for instance, greater economic interdependence among house- holds. An agrarian polity's political economy depends on mobilization of agricultural surplus from producing units, and increases in household agricultural production frequently follow inten- sive integration (Bermann 1994; D' Altroy 1987:12; Schreiber 1992:28). Intensified house- hold agricultural production has been well docu- mented for the Inka state (Costin 1986; D'Altroy 1992; Earle et al. 1987; Hastorf 1993), and a sim- ilar process has been proposed for the Wari polity (Schreiber 1992:260). To assess production shifts at Lukurmata, f111 lot assemblages were used to calculate the frequency (per 1,000 sherds) and density (per m3) indexes for hoes, grinding stones, spindle whorls, and bone awls (wichunas) shown in Table 2. An inherent problem in using tool discard rates to monitor changes in production output is that changes in tool deposition can result from factors other than changes in level of production, so that, for exam- ple, an increase in tool frequency in household contexts might reflect greater use of fields near res- iden (McAnany 1992a:211). However, I assume that increased agricultural and textile production should lead to greater breakage and higher discard rates of hoes, spindle whorls, and wichunas (Figure 5a), so that shifts in the relative frequency of these artifact types should provide a relative measure of the intensity of production. Craft Production and Agricultural Intensification Textile production was an important part of the political economy of native Andean polities, with : a tl t : . ::* i6FW ;:: ;C [j Sa$ [lflu) !

Investigation in the Mantaro Valley, for instance, has shown that Wanka household textile production (as measured by spindle whorl density) doubled following Inka conquest (D'Altroy 1992:211; Earle et al. 1987; Hastorf 1990:261). The relative frequency of spinning and weaving tools (spindle whorls and wichunas) in the Lukurmata fill lots shows no change through time (Figures 6 and 7); incorpo- ration into the Tiwanaku polity apparently did not lead to increased yarn or textile demands on Lukurmata ridge residents. The fill lot assem- blages, however, do reflect two important devel- opments in domestic production during the late Tiwanaku IV period: (1) a new household activity (represented by the manufacture of camelid mandible tools) and (2) agricultural intensifica- tion. Camelid Mandible Tools. Scrapers made from camelid mandibles, and the debris associated with their manufacture, were found with the Structure 33-39 occupation and each contemporaneous domestic occupation elsewhere at Lukurmata (Figure 5b). The function of these tools is not known; they have been interpreted as hide scrap- ers or agricultural implements (Bermann 1990; Goldstein 1989). The wear on the bottom of the dorsal section of the horizontal ramus suggests a scraping function. The production or use of these tools can be viewed as a universal household activity at Lukurmata, and perhaps at Tiwanaku as well (Bermann 1994; Janusek 1994; Webster 1993:243). Camelid mandible tools have been found at each Tiwanaku IV/V site where domes- tic contexts have been investigated but have not been recovered from non-Tiwanaku sites or Tiwanaku III occupations. Overall, their distribu- tion seems closely linked to the Tiwanaku state. Agricultural Tools. Three types of implements were treated as markers of agricultural produc- tion: chipped-stone biface hoes (Figure Sc), mod- ified deer antlers (Figure Sd), and ground-stone "axes" (waqtana). Biface hoes (chontas) were common agricultural implements throughout the Andes but are most common in the Tiwanaku heartland in Formative-period and post-Tiwanaku</page><page sequence="10">102 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 contexts (Albarracin-Jordan 1992:84; Mathews 1992:256; Stanish and Steadman 1994). Hoes of this type may have been more important in dry land farming than in raised-Eleld agriculture. A handful of biface hoes or fragments have been found at Tiwanaku sites, including Lukurmata (Bermann 1990; Ryden 1947: 159), but they have not yet been found in domestic contexts at Tiwanaku itself (Janusek 1994; Ryden 1947:79). The use of deer antlers (chinchas) to hoe tubers in the Peruvian highlands has been documented by Venero (1987). Antler hoes with identical wear patterns have been recovered from Lukurmata and other highland Bolivian sites (Liendo 1956; Ryden 1947). Ethnographic sources indicate that ground-stone "axes" (waqtana) were hafted and used to break up soil in agricultural fields (Erickson 1988:209; La Barre 1948; Tschopik 1947). This tool type has been found at Lukurmata and other Tiwanaku highland Tiwanaku sites (Bennett 1934, 1936). Grinding stones also have been used to mea- sure intensity of agricultural production (Light- foot and Feinman 1982; Stanish 1985), and their frequency was recorded at Lukurmata. Because of their durability, grinding stones are less useful as a direct measure of agricultural output than hoes. Nor are grinding stones always discarded at the end of their use life; grinding stones were incor- porated into house and tomb architecture at Lukurmata. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the rep- resentation of grinding stones did not signiEl- cantly change through time. In contrast, the rise in the frequency index of hoes from .68 during the Tiwanaku III period to 1.75 for the Tiwanaku IV period, suggests inten- sified agricultural production, particularly during the late Tiwanaku IV period (Figures 6 and 7). This increase is also reflected in the ubiquity of agricultural implements in the f1ll lots (Table 3). The Tiwanaku IV hoes consisted of three ground- stone hoe fragments, one chipped-stone biface hoe and three fragments, and four antler hoe frag- ments. Their dispersal in the f1ll lots suggests that the fragments represent 11 individual tools, found in 22 percent of the Tiwanaku IV f1ll lots. We can have fairly high conEldence that hoe fragments were being deposited more frequently in lots from this period than in those of the Tiwanaku III period. Even if hoes represent tools used in nearby garden or hill slope production, rather than in raised Elelds, the increased use of nearby Elelds in a time when raised-Eleld use was at its maxi- mum suggests agricultural intensiElcation. Domestic production reverted to pre- Tiwanaku IV patterns after Tiwanaku's collapse, with the cessation of mandible tool production and a decline in the frequency of agricultural implements (Figures 5 and 6). With the disap- pearance of centralized political authority, surplus demands ceased, and household economic pat- terns changed correspondingly. The timing of the shifts in the f1ll lot assemblages argues that the domestic production changes of the Tiwanaku IV period were associated with the Tiwanaku state, even if organized indirectly through local kurakas or ayllus. Agricultural Intensification in the Late Tiwanaku IV Period Increased agricultural production by Lukurmata households may have been part of a larger pattern of intensiElcation throughout the Tiwanaku sys- tem in the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. The raised Elelds of the Pampa Koani were located 2 to 10 km from Lukurmata, but some 6.5 ha of raised Elelds are found within the site itself. Decorated sherds and a radiocarbon sample from test-pitting of Elelds just south of the temple hilltop date their construction and use to the late Tiwanaku IV period (Graffam 1990:135). Furthermore, radio- carbon dating of a sample of raised Elelds in the Pampa Koani suggests that "the most intensive period of raised Eleld construction" was between A.D. 650 and 1000 (Kolata and Ortloff 1996; Seddon 1994:145). Settlement survey in the Middle and Lower Tiwanaku Valley has revealed a sharp increase in the number of third and fourth-order settlements during the Tiwanaku IV period (Albarracin- Jordan and Mathews 1990). Albarracin-Jordan and Mathews (1990: 132-133) interpret this increase as an indication of agricultural intensifi- cation beginning in the eighth century A.D. In the Juli-Pomata area in the northern Titicaca Basin, Stanish (1994) has shown that surplus agricultural production and raised-Eleld use reached a maxi- mum when the local population was most closely tied to the Tiwanaku polity (in the centuries prior to A.D. 1000).</page><page sequence="11">Table 3.

Here, a "marked increase" in the representation of chipped-stone hoes in domestic contexts from the Chen Chen phase (A.D. 725-1000) closely parallels the changes observed at Lukurmata (Goldstein 1989:238). Changes in Ritual Activities A set of public architecture sites, widely distrib- uted ceremonial vessels, and iconography featur- ing anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures has led many investigators to stress the role of reli- gion and ideology in Tiwanaku statecraft. Ritual items found in Lukurmata domestic contexts sup- port the view that shared religious practices were important integrative mechanisms at the local and household levels in the Tiwanaku system during the Tiwanaku III and IV periods. Domestic Ritual Artifacts Few ritual items were recovered from Formative- period contexts (Bermann 1994). Bone tubes, carved bone spoons and spatulas, small stone mor- tars, hollowed camelid bones carved with elabo- rate motifs, and a possible snuff tray made from a camelid tibia indicate that hallucinogenic drug usage became part of domestic ritual at Lukurmata in the late Tiwanaku III period and continued through the Tiwanaku IV period. Similar "drug paraphernalia" occurs at Tiwanaku and Tiwanaku sites in Bolivia, Chile, and Peru (Browman 1978, 1981; Janusek 1994:243; Wassen 1972). Browman (1978:334) describes assemblages of mortars, enema tubes, snuff trays, and small vial-like con- tainers as essential elements of the widespread Tiwanaku drug culture, "the most frequently iden- tified mark of Tiwanaku influence." Use of modeled ceremonial burners on Bermann] DOMESTIC LIFE IN THE TIWANAKU HEARTLAND 103 pedestals (incensarios) was widespread through- out the south-central Andes during the Tiwanaku III through V periods. Ceremonial burners in the form of felines have been identified as one of the artifacts most closely connected to the spread of a Tiwanaku-centered religion during the Tiwanaku III period (Chavez 1985:153). No fragments of these vessels were found in Formative or Tiwanaku III domestic contexts at Lukurmata, although they may have been used in mortuary or offering activities away from residential areas (Chavez 1985:148). Tiwanaku IV domestic con- texts yielded fragments of polychrome modeled feline incensarios, keros, and vessels decorated with the Staff-God, puma, and condor the most important elements of Tiwanaku state iconogra- phy. These fragments, not limited to elite resi- dences, denote the extension of a central ideology to the Lukurmata domestic realm through house- hold offering and status-legitimizing activities beginning in the early Tiwanaku IV period. Offering Caches A widespread offering tradition of the Tiwanaku IV period involved the deliberate burial of a feline incensario filled with burned organic matter. Offerings of this type had been found in associa- tion with public architecture at Lukurmata, Chiripa, Pajchiri, Khonko Wankani, and Mocachi (Bennett 1936; Casanova 1942; Goldstein 1993; Rivera 1989; Ryden 1947). At Lukurmata, this offering activity clearly represented a household activity as well, with incensario offerings placed in .5- to 2-m-deep pits located below or adjacent to domestic structures. A cluster of incensario offer- ings also was found in a terrace just north of the Lukurmata ridgetop households (Bermann 1994). Offerings continued after Tiwanaku collapse, but in an altered form. Offerings of the Pacajes period consisted of the burial of a large utilitarian jar containing a deliberately broken small bowl and chipped-stone cores and bifaces. One of the four such jars excavated on the Lukurmata ridge also contained human infant remains. Similar fea- tures have been found at contemporaneous sites to the east and south of Lake Titicaca (Bennett 1936; Ryden 1959). Mortuary Ritual Formative-period tombs at Lukurmata were</page><page sequence="12">104 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 8, No. 2, 1997 located near dwellings. Graves were not placed near residential occupations in the subsequent Tiwanaku III period. While most adults and subadults were buried in domestic areas during the Tiwanaku IV period, some high-status adults were placed in the site's central platform. Each platform tomb contained a large number of grave goods, ranging from unfired clay figurines to the most elaborate Tiwanaku-style pottery. In con- trast, individuals in the eight stone-lined tombs found adjacent to (or under) Tiwanaku domestic structures on the ridge were accompanied by few grave goods. A secondary burial was clearly asso- ciated with the occupation of Structure 33. This consisted of the pelvis and right leg of an adult in a partially stone-lined tomb sealed by the house- floor. A similar pattern of primary and secondary burial under and around domestic structures occurred in the AKE-2 and Chiji Jawira residen- tial sections at Tiwanaku (Janusek 1994). Two aboveground tombs dating to the late Tiwanaku IV period were found, one to the north- east of each patio. Each tomb consisted of a cylin- drical, stone upper chamber containing human skeletal remains and a belowground chamber. A large, modeled llama incensario lacking the head was found standing in the lower chamber of one of the tombs (Bermann 1994). In form and size, these tombs resemble the Type 3 chulpas with subterranean cists described as Late Interme- diate (A.D. 1100-1450) sites by Tschopik (1946:15-16). Aboveground tombs have long been viewed as characteristic of the Late Intermediate or Late Horizon periods in the altiplano, but such struc- tures had Tiwanaku antecedents. Aboveground "slab cist graves" or "collared tombs" are found at Tiwanaku sites near Puno, Peru (Hyslop 1976:91), and in the Chen Chen-phase (Tiwanaku V period) cemeteries at Omo, Peru (Goldstein 1989). Chulpas of the Late Intermediate or Late Horizon periods are usually interpreted in the context of the emergence of a regional elite (Hyslop 1976; Stanish 1992). Because of their small size and association with non-elite residen- tial areas, it is unlikely that the aboveground tombs at Lukurmata were the burial crypts of high-ranking lineages. As highly visible markers of ancestry, perhaps even patio group shrines, the patterns. structures may reflect an increased emphasis on establishing ancestral claims and publicly dis- playing membership in descent groups. Community-Level Ceremony Tiwanaku-style temple complexes occur in the Tiwanaku heartland, the Puno region of Peru, and the Moquegua Valley (Goldstein 1993). Integration of local populations into the Tiwanaku polity would have rested heavily on the ceremo- nial role of these public architecture centers. The temple complex at Lukurmata duplicated in microcosm the monuments at Tiwanaku itself. Major public architecture components on the Lukurmata hilltop included a terraced platform (75 x 75 m in size) and a sunken temple set into a second, smaller, stone-faced platform (Kolata 1993; Rivera 1989). A mortuary feature discov- ered near a deeply buried wall north of the temple indicates that the construction of public architec- ture at Lukurmata was accompanied by dedica- tory sacrifices or secondary interments resembling those found at the Akapana platform in Tiwanaku (Manzanilla 1992; Manzanilla and Woodard 1990). The Lukurmata feature consisted of the partial remains of six individuals (one adult, one juvenile, and four children), with two buried face down (Bermann 1989). As at Tiwanaku, most of the individuals were repre- sented by partial remains (the upper torso or the pelvis and legs). In summary, the Tiwanaku "state cult," as Kolata (1993:280) describes it, appears to have operated at many societal levels and was an important institution linking Lukurmata house- holds to an overarching ideological order. Ritual ties to Tiwanaku intensified during the Tiwanaku IV period, marked by the construction of Tiwanaku-style public architecture and the broad adoption of Tiwanaku-style household ceremony, ritual paraphernalia, iconography, and mortuary Changes in Household Ceramics Changes in household social and economic status are potential consequences of consolidation into a larger political unit. These changes reflect a process of vertical integration in which status dis- tinctions and referents associated with the politi- cal center are adopted locally, so that materials of central style and manufacture come to mark</page><page sequence="13">Bermann] DOMESTIC LIFE IN THE TIWANAKU HEARTLAND 105 social differences (Costin and Earle 1989; Earle and D'Altroy 1989:203). At Lukurmata, shifts in domestic pottery assemblages, particularly in the source, variety, and quantity of serving vessels, provided a line of evidence for evaluating this aspect of social integration. Archaeologists study- ing various dimensions of social status have sin- gled out serving vessels as one of the categories of household possessions most likely to reflect a household's social functions and wealth (Douglas and Isherwood 1979; Smith 1987). "Exotic" serving vessels (i.e., nonlocal, non- Tiwanaku cups and bowls) were a normal compo- nent of Lukurmata domestic ceramic inventories during all periods. The sources of the exotic ves- sels are not yet known, although many resemble pottery from the Cochabamba region. The charac- teristics of these vessels (form, labor intensive manufacture, high degree of decoration) suggest that they were prestige wares used in serving, dis- play, and offerings. These were largely sup- planted by centrally produced Tiwanaku-style vessels (cups, tripod bowls, keros, flaring-sided bowls) in the late Tiwanaku III and IV periods, although they never completely disappeared from household inventories. The proportion of exotic vessel fragments in fill lot assemblages declined from 10 percent of serving vessels in early Tiwanaku III assemblages, to less than 5 percent in early Tiwanaku IV assemblages. It was only in the late Tiwanaku IV period that Tiwanaku-style utilitarian wares replaced local utilitarian wares in Lukurmata households. A second change in the fill lot assemblages was a decline in the amount and range of elabo- rate serving/display vessels used by the ridge households during the Tiwanaku IV period. The most labor-intensive Tiwanaku IV wares found in Lukurmata households were serving vessels man- ufactured in large workshops at Tiwanaku (Janusek 1994). These forms included keros (for serving liquids) and bowls, tazones, cuencas, and restricted bowls (for serving food). Fragments from these vessels dropped from 12 percent of the total sherd assemblage, in the early Tiwanaku IV period, to 5 percent of the assemblage in the late Tiwanaku IV period. This change was part of a larger drop in the overall proportion of Tiwanaku- style decorated pottery used by ridge households. Fragments from Tiwanaku Black-on-Red and Polychrome pottery made up 17.4 percent of the total sherds in the early Tiwanaku IV fill lots, but only 11 percent of the sherds in the late Tiwanaku IV fill lots (Figure 8). The ridge assemblages can be compared to assemblages from households in the Misiton sec- tor, a residential area in the southern section of Lukurmata. In the Misiton sector, Tiwanaku dec- orated sherds made up roughly 21 percent (frag- ments from serving vessels roughly 15 percent) of late Tiwanaku IV assemblages, indicating that the decline in usage of Tiwanaku decorated pottery seen on the ridge was not a sitewide pattern or part of a general diachronic trend. The decline in remains of the most elaborate Tiwanaku-style pottery suggests that a new level of household integration in the Tiwanaku imperial status order developed during the late Tiwanaku IV period. Ridge households may have had less need for vessels used in serving/feasting activities or had diminished access to the central prestige wares requisite to display activities. Changes in Long Distance Ties Access to long-distance exchange goods is one measure of the degree of economic isolation of the individual household. Communities drawn into a larger polity are likely to participate in a wider exchange system, with long-distance trade channeled through higher-order centers of the set- tlement hierarchy. Tiwanaku was at the center of a far-flung exchange network stretching from the Pacific coast to the eastern montana, so we might expect that Lukurmata's incorporation into the polity would result in greater household access to long-distance trade items and materials from new regions. The small sample size of nonceramic, long- distance trade materials in the ridge fill lots pre- vents quantitative assessment of this hypothesis, but our impression is that the amount of long-dis- tance trade items at Lukurmata increased dramat- ically as relations with Tiwanaku intensified. Recognizable long-distance trade goods such as marine shell, obsidian, and sodalite were not found in Formative-period contexts. Only token quantities of these items were recovered from (late) Tiwanaku III deposits. Marine shell, obsid- ian (Lago de Titicaca type), and sodalite (from Cochabamba) appear in appreciable quantities at</page><page sequence="14">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 confidence 1 99% I 95% - 80 Early Tiwanaku III I I I Late Early Late Tlwanaku Tiwanaku Tiwanaku III IV IV Period Figure 8.

This change accords with preliminary information from Tiwanaku and the Tiwanaku Valley that points to a sharp upswing in regional and long-distance trade in the Tiwanaku heartland during the Tiwanaku IV period Browman 1997; Janusek 1994). Importation of these materials into Lukurmata continued after the collapse of the Tiwanaku polity.2 Discussion The Lukurmata household sequence represents one small area of a large and complex site. We cannot confidently base conclusions concerning domestic organization and change on a handful of houses. Yet, lacking any other information on these issues, observations drawn on the small Lukurmata sample point to potentially important patterns to be tested by future research. Incorporation into the Tiwanaku polity was not accompanied by an abrupt transformation of domestic life on the ridge at Lukurmata. Instead, vertical integration appears to have developed in successive phases, each characterized by relation- ships of different types, intensities, and degrees of directness. From household evidence alone, it would be difficult to distinguish when Lukurmata became part of the Tiwanaku polity. Initial (Tiwanaku III period) relationships between Lukurmata households and prestate Tiwanaku appear to have been relatively indirect, of low intensity, and manifested at the household level in the use of a small quantity of Tiwanaku III-style serving vessels (not necessarily acquired directly from Tiwanaku) and the adoption of Tiwanaku-style rituals involving drug ingestion. Without the evidence that Tiwanaku was already a substantial public architecture center during this period, we might not even consider these material patterns manifestations of vertical integration. Vertical integration became much more direct during the early Tiwanaku IV period as Lukurmata developed into a second-order center in the regional settlement hierarchy. The public architecture reflects the extension of core institu- tions (and central-place functions) to Lukurmata. The nature of ties between individual households and the capital changed as well when Lukurmata was incorporated into the Tiwanaku polity. There is no evidence for surplus production or economic shifts by Lukurmata households at this time, but changes in pottery assemblages and long-distance ties signal incorporation into a Tiwanaku-domi- nated regional economy. The adoption of Tiwanaku stylistic canons, ritual patterns, mortu- ary patterns, and status references represent increasingly intensive and direct exchange and social relationships with the capital. The greatest changes at the household level occurred in the late Tiwanaku IV period. Shifts suggesting new and more intensive integrative relationships include: (1) changes in the house- hold inventory of decorated and serving vessels, (2) a reorganization of household activities involving increased hoe usage (agricultural pro- duction) and camelid tool use/manufacture, and (3) the formation of larger coresidential units arranged in patio groups similar in size, degree of segmentation, and contents to those of the AKE- 1 section of Tiwanaku. Although some aspects of Lukurmata domestic life and material culture always remained locally distinct, these changes suggest the "Tiwanakuization" of the ridge house- 106 [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 ) I e II s 11 )</page><page sequence="15">Bermannl DOMESTIC LIFE IN THE TIWANAKU HEARTLAND 107 holds: i.e., full social and economic assimilation into the Tiwanaku polity during the latter portion of the Tiwanaku IV period. Coresidence, Agricultural Intensification, and Land Transmission The changes in household composition or mor- phology that apparently took place in the late Tiwanaku IV period are likely to reflect a shift in one or more of the major functions of households: production, transmission, distribution, and repro- duction (Wilk and Rathje 1982). The develop- ment of larger or multiple-family domestic units is frequently related by scholars to shifts in household productive patterns or changes in the role of the household as a unit of transmission. One of the factors commonly cited as favoring increased household size is increased agricultural production (Netting 1993:89; Wilk and Netting 1984). Increased production may stem from demands from above for surplus production, or from labor demands (for public architecture pro- jects, warfare, or the working of elite and public Elelds), that cause households to intensify produc- tion to meet their own basic subsistence needs (Hastorf 1993). It is unlikely that the development of patio groups at Lukurmata was linked to the labor requirements of raised-Eleld production. Raised fields are not labor intensive, and Prehispanic traditions of reciprocity would mini- mize the need for each household to maintain a large labor supply of its own (Erickson 1988). Particular patterns of production also may favor larger households. While simple, linear pro- duction arranged in a yearly cycle can be effec- tively carried out by small (nuclear) households, a larger household is more efficient for complex, diversiEled production or production in which labor requirements of major tasks are simultane- ous (Wilk and Netting 1984; Wilk and Rathje 1982:623). Raised-field agriculture, again, by itself would not be likely to promote larger domestic groups. Information on economic spe- cialization and task diversity in the Tiwanaku heartland is very limited, but investigation at both Lukurmata and Tiwanaku suggests signiElcant craft specialization at both the household and suprahousehold levels late in the Tiwanaku IV period (Janusek 1994; Kolata 1993: 172). One interpretation of the coresidence inherent in patio groupings is that continued association with the stem family provides prestige or beneElts (social or economic) for younger household members (Santley 1993). Viewed from this per- spective, growth in household size reflects the increasing signiElcance of the household as a unit of land transmission, typically under conditions of land scarcity (Netting 1993; Wilk and Netting 1984; Wilk and Rathje 1982:628). There is a strong cross-cultural correlation between extended households and land scarcity (Goldschmidt and Kunkel 1971). As pressure for land increases, transmission of land rights from one generation to another becomes an increas- ingly important function of the domestic group, and the membership of the group controlling access to land becomes more and more strictly delineated (Wilk and Rathje 1982:628). Relative land scarcity may have developed in the Tiwanaku heartland during the Tiwanaku IV period as the regional population grew, the land- scape around Lukurmata ''fillled,'' and agricultural areas were increasingly given over to supporting the demographic concentration at Tiwanaku, per- haps, as Kolata (1992, 1993) argued, in the form of large estates belonging to the Tiwanaku nobil- ity. If these processes led to competition for land among lan&amp;olding descent groups, and perhaps among individual households within descent groups, then property transmission and descent- based claims to land would have assumed a new importance. The late Tiwanaku IV period repre- sents a time of large-scale hydraulic improvement in the Tiwanaku heartland and, as the Lukurmata f1ll lot evidence suggests, intensiEled domestic production. In this context, the development at Lukurmata of larger coresidential clusters in the form of patio groupings (a more formal spatial delineation of kin groups), aboveground mortuary display, and below-floor burial might reflect the heightened emphasis on membership in a spa- tially and ritually deElned, kin-based, corporate group. Recent debate concerning Tiwanaku political economy has largely focused on the degree and form of state involvement in raised-Eleld produc- tion in the heartland (Erickson 1993; Graffam 1990, 1992; Kolata 1991, 1992). The Lukurmata domestic remains reveal little, however, about the institutions or organization of production and so</page><page sequence="16">108 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997 do not bear directly on the central issues in this debate. Instead, the Lukurmata household sequence illuminates other attributes of Tiwanaku political economy by revealing several household economic "functions." The changes in the domes- tic patterns in the late Tiwanaku IV period are consistent with a shift from the type of locally organized, or "for-use," production envisioned by Erickson (1993), to a centrally directed surplus production that Kolata (1986, 1991) argues sup- ported the Tiwanaku ruling stratum and the popu- lation at the capital. Alternatively, the increase in agricultural pro- duction during the late Tiwanaku IV period could reflect a shift in how surpluses were generated: from an extrahousehold mode of production in which labor was temporarily taken from the household to work state or elite lands, to a mode of production based on stimulating household production. If so, surplus production in the vicin- ity of Lukurmata may have been essentially out- side the domestic domain for a considerable portion of the Tiwanaku IV period. In either case, the overall diachronic pattern would be consistent with other indications of the growing dominance of the capital and its material needs over its hin- terland through the Tiwanaku IV period (Albarracin-Jordan and Mathews 1990; Bermann 1994; McAndrews et al. 1996). The timing of the domestic shifts dovetails with Kolata's (1991:115) hypothesis that raised-field produc- tion in the Tiwanaku heartland greatly intensified during the Tiwanaku IV and V periods, and with Seddon's (1994) dates for major episodes of raised-field construction in the Pampa Koani. Vertical Integration in the Heartland The Tiwanaku IV developments at the household, local, and regional levels illustrate significant processes in the evolution of state heartlands or core areas, in general. Given both the spatial proximity and strategic importance of the heart- land to ruling institutions, vertical integration should be most intensive, direct, and multi- stranded in the heartland. Vertical integration should be further stimulated by the presence of truly urban centers requiring sustaining areas (Batten 1993). Because of the high cost of mov- ing bulk goods, most of the agricultural surplus needed to support an urban population must be generated directly from a surrounding hinterland. Investigation in the Tiwanaku heartland indi- cates that as the capital grew, settlement and eco- nomic activities in the heartland were increasingly oriented toward its provisioning, with the emergence of a dendritic settlement sys- tem (McAndrews et al. 1996). The development of the Tiwanaku Valley and adjacent drainages into an urban sustaining area during the Tiwanaku IV period was accompanied by new forms of ver- tical integration-economic, social, and ideologi- cal reflecting extractive economic relationships, political centralization, and intensive social con- solidation. The new integrative ties of the Tiwanaku IV period were manifested in the "cultural homo- geneity" that allows archaeologists to distinguish a Tiwanaku state "core" as such. Elements of this process included the household-level adoption of state stylistic preferences, domestic organization, and ritual and mortuary activities. The most direct articulation of individual households with the Tiwanaku state may have remained embedded in the religious and ceremonial sphere, with Tiwanaku-style temple complexes acting as the nodal points of vertical integration. Areas of Bolivia, Peru, and Chile outside the heartland did not undergo this transformation; local populations there were connected to Tiwanaku through much less intensive ties, and individual households only articulated indirectly with the Tiwanaku polity. Households in most out- lying areas would have articulated with Tiwanaku through a fluid and narrow set of religious and prestige-good exchange ties. In "provincial areas" such as Puno and the Cochabamba region of Bolivia, integration may have been rooted in inter- action between local elites and Tiwanaku rulers and manifested in local adoption of Tiwanaku- style sumptuary goods, ideology, and religious practices. In the Juli-Pomata area of the northern Titicaca Basin, for example, this interaction was accompanied by the expansion of pre-existing elite/public architecture centers and the develop- ment of a local political economy maximizing sur- plus production from raised fields (Stanish 1994:322).

Even within the Tiwanaku heartland, the image of a network, with temple centers con- necting relatively autonomous populations to imperial institutions through ties of varying nature, intensity, and directness, may be more appropriate than that of an "oil-stain" of territor- ial political control (Postgate 1991). Vertical Integration in the Prehispanic Andes The Lukurmata domestic sequence reflects a process of assimilation that took place gradually and unevenly. Comparison of household-level processes with changes at the community and regional levels reveals several disjunctions. For example, the striking community and regional- level changes early in the Tiwanaku IV period, with Lukurmata developing into a secondary tem- ple center, were not accompanied by dramatic changes at the domestic level. While these obser- vations are potentially an artifact of small sample size, they also may reflect an important character- istic of vertical integration-that integration evolves in an irregular fashion, with separate economies or systems of authority that articulate with central institutions indirectly, loosely, or not at all (D'Altroy 1992; Pease 1982; Schreiber 1992; Shils 1982). Even in the heartland of pre- modern states, political, economic, social, and ideological institutions are seldom completely isomorphic or overlapping (Mann 1986). Some integrative institutions (long-distance trade, elite interaction, temple hierarchy) are likely to be more visible archaeologically than integrative processes at the household level. Identification of the latter must be based on careful studies of change through time in domestic patterns and comparative data from the local and regional level. The characteristic mode of integration of the Tiwanaku polity was quite different from that of the Inka and Wari polities, lacking the physical infrastructure of bureaucratic control that make the Inka and Wari empires so easy to recognize as such. But at least in the core area, the Tiwanaku polity achieved some of the same functions- political control, specialized craft production, nt- ual hegemony, intensified agricultural production although through forms of vertical integration that are still poorly understood. Reconstructing vertical integration at all soci- etal levels is particularly relevant for the Andes where a growing body of archaeological and eth- nohistoric information argues for forms of Prehispanic integration based on alliance and coalition rather than centralized authority (AlbaxTacin-Jordan 1992, 1996; Izko 1992; Murra 1984; Netherly 1984, 1990, 1993; Platt 1987; Schaedel 1988). To a greater extent than previ- ously recognized, native polities, including the Inka state, may have been bound together by "sacred propositions and sanctions" rather than political control and "coercive force" and may have grown through coalescence rather thaxl con- quest (Silverman 1993:342). From an investiga- tive perspective, viewing Prehispanic polities as loosely integrated systems rather than as mono- lithic entities has the value of drawing attention to the speciElc ways that constituent social groups are bound into larger political formations. This knowledge is critical to developing more sophis- ticated understandings of the nature, operation, and evolution of complex societies in general. Acknowledgments.

Dates and features I assign to the late Tiwanaku IV period are classified as "Tiwanaku V" in an alternative chronology now in use for the site of Tiwanaku itself (Kolata and Ortloff 1996:Table 8.3). 2. The ceramic stylistic evidence of regional ties is ambiguous because the source of Tiwanaku III "exotic" (nonlocallnon- Tiwanaku) pottery is not known. Tiwanaku IV assemblages include vessels in the Mojocoya and Omereque styles of the eastern valleys of Cochabamba, as well as Juruquilla-style fragments, indicating new trade ties to southern highland pop- ulations of Potosf or Oruro. Contacts between Lukurmata and populations to the east and south continued after Tiwanaku collapse. Pacajes-period fill lots and ridge tombs yielded, in addition to Pacajes-style pottery, vessels in the Chucuito, Mallku, and Mollo styles, denoting long-distance contacts with populations in central Bolivia, in the northern Lake Titicaca Basin, and to the east of Lake Titicaca, respectively (Bermann 1994).</page></plain_text>
