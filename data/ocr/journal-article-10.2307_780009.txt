<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gilka Wara Cespedes Huayiio, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Bolivian Identity in the Music of "Los Kjarkas"* Introduction The funeral of Ulises Hermosa in April 1992 best portrays how a large sector of Bolivians feel about their music. A throng of about fifty thousand mourners, five kilometers long, paid their last respects as his remains were placed in a privileged site reserved for the illustrious by the authorities of Cochabamba, his native town. This last homage paid to a musician, a member of Los Kjarkas, one of the most famous, popular, and idolized groups of musica folklorica, reflects the in- volvement of a people who as admirers and consumers of their music had come to express their collective loss. This immense crowd, a crosscut of the population-young, old, musicians, panpipe players, a swarm of the "folk"-gathered on this occasion of emotional outpour, because at some time or another, in one way or another, Los Kjarkas have touched and undeniably made an impact in the perception, attitude, and feelings towards Bolivian music at home and abroad. In this article I want to explore the trajectory of this extraordinary group, focusing on two issues pertinent to the cultivators of the folkl6rica genre. On the one hand, is the question of representation of Bolivian music to Bolivians at home: how do Los Kjarkas construct, mediate, carry, and communicate the imprint of Bolivianness, and what kinds of processes are at work that validate their music? If the social, the cultural, and the political are imbedded in the sonic, in what ways do Los Kjarkas reflect these pro- cesses? What kinds of discourses are represented in their music? Moreover, what kinds of chords, literally and figuratively, do Los Kjarkas play that resonate so profoundly in the collective psyche of their public? On the other hand, considering the dissemination of "ethnic" musics in the general panorama of world music and their inevitable mercantilization, how do Latin American Music Review, Volume 14, Number 1, Spring/Summer 1993 ?1993 by the University of Texas Press</page><page sequence="2">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 53 these musicians cross the boundaries to become a part of the music industry? Or do they? At a time when the Andean Sound is becoming a part of the sonic scene from Europe to Japan, when the sound of (synthesized) pan- pipes appears in more and more recordings (a favorite of New Age music), these musicians feel that they can rightfully claim a space for themselves in this larger picture. In Bolivia the idea that for too long Bolivian music has been appropriated by others without being given its due is commonly (and rightfully, as we shall see) shared by musicians and non-musicians alike. To date Los Kjarkas have recorded close to twenty albums, including original materials, anthologies, and compilations. I have chosen to discuss music from the album "Canto a la Mujer de mi Pueblo" (Song to the Woman of my People), issued in 1982. In my opinion, this album is most repre- sentative of the characteristic stylistic imprint that has been associated with the music of Los Kjarkas. Also in this album the original version of the famous piece "Llorando se fue," later world-known and rebaptized as a Lambada. Subsequent albums, although creative, aesthetically pleasing, and interesting, prove redundant to a degree, insisting to a great extent what has already been stated with this album. Steven Feld has argued that musical meaning is socially situated and emphasized that music as a communication process necessarily implies interpretation, involving the listener in an active role, who in a switchback of musical and extra-musical associations "works through the dialectics by developing choices and juxtaposing background knowledge" (1984: 8). Feld coined the term "interpretive moves" to denote this process of fitting one's temporal listening experience into a "context of prior and plausible experiences to interpret what is going on" (Feld 1984, 7-8). The notion of "interpretive moves" helps in understanding the complexity involved in the production code and the receiver/consumer's interpretation. I will try to guide my discussion toward an explanation of how Los Kjarkas address fundamental issues of identity, gender, and values via an itinerary through the composition process, the encoding of the songs, and how the ideas are constructed in them to the interpretation process by looking at the social interaction between the musicians and their audience. I think that the personal and collective reception of the audience very definitely reaffirms the musicians' message. In the second part of this article, I will explore the way in which the now famous (or infamous) Lambada was appropriated to become such a famous World-Beat hit. At each step of the discussion, I will try to highlight the biographical elements of Los Kjarkas' repertoire and the layers of historical, geographical, ethnic, class and aesthetic factors, that is, the "natural history of signs and symbols" as Geerz would put it, inscribed in the music that may explain the wide popularity of Los Kjarkas. I believe that the local popularity of Los Kjarkas is less a function of a good marketing</page><page sequence="3">54 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas strategy, (although this too plays an important role), and more a function of their ability to operate on the affective level through the conscious and unconscious use of elements that express intense feelings. To understand where Los Kjarkas fit in the general panorama of Bolivian popular music, it is necessary to trace the socio-historical events that sur- round and permeate the cultural production of this music. In Bolivia the term musica folklorica has come to be defined and accepted in the general context of Bolivian discourse as representing the musical practices and products native to Bolivia. Either rural or urban, indigenous or criollo, these are based on the ever-flowing rivulets of traditional forms, genres, and idioms that feed the main current of musica folkl6rica and consolidate in styles recognized as unmistakably Bolivian. The term distinguishes this music from other imported commercial musics such as rock, pop, salsa, and others that simultaneously form part of the general picture in the pro- duction and consumption of popular music. Musicafolklorica is also regarded as different in kind from the idiom of the Canto Nuevo (or Nueva Cancion) movement that, often adopting native musical features, carries an overt political agenda. Urban musicafolklorica as a genre has grown and flourished as an outcome of a fundamental change in values due to a transformed Bolivian society as a result of the nationalist revolution of 1952. Much has been written about this historical event, and although this is not the place to analyze the rami- fications of the revolution, the reader should be aware that an understand- ing of this event better illuminates how the changes undergone in all areas, including symbolic expressions, are connected by the ideological strands of those developments. Along with Peru and Ecuador, Bolivia has one of the largest indigenous populations in South America. In a classic example of the Latin American latifundist system, where the extreme inequality in land shares was essential for the control of peasant labor, the Aymara and Quechua bore the brunt of an unjust and uneconomical system of land ownership by a minority of absentee landowners and mining barons (Klein 1991: 234 ff). Heralded by the progressive Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (M.N.R.) party, the rallying cry of this revolution addressed two major issues: the country's economic liberation from the exploitative practices of the tin barons and the latifundist landlords, and the integration into the state of theretofore disenfranchised Aymara and Quechua peasants who, though constituting a demographic majority, were nevertheless the social group least represented civilly and politically. A series of laws were decreed favoring the Aymara peasants and miners, and included agrarian reform, the nationalization of major mines, and the right to vote. Although these were to a great extent political measures to consolidate the power base of the party, the new laws radically changed the social situation. The reforms called for a rethinking</page><page sequence="4">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 55 of social categories since the civil rights of the Aymara and Quechua as full citizens were warranted, at least on paper, through such measures. This intended integration is best symbolized in the postage stamp issued at the time of the agrarian reform; president Paz Estenssoro embracing an Aymara peasant. The newly recognized rights and reforms also meant that the urban areas saw in the course of the next few years a great migration from the rural areas, resulting in a heavy Indian presence that could not be ignored. Because social class in Bolivia is related to ethnicity, indigenous expressive forms of music, dance, language, and festivities were subject to the nega- tive value judgements of some strata of the urban classes. To redress this, one of the first changes was the conscious effort to modify the language used to refer to the ethnic Indian. The derogatory term Indio thereafter turned into campesino (peasant), thus neutralizing and blurring the negative connotations. There was a general shift in the overall official and unofficial policies and measures that pointed to a recognition of the symbolic impor- tance of expressive forms, particularly music. While the administration created a new Ministerio de Asuntos Campesinos (Ministry of Peasant Affairs), the Ministry of Education1 created a new division of folklore. One function of this new division was the organization and sponsorship of traditional music festivals both in the city and in selected rural towns. Thus the valida- tion of native musical culture was institutionalized while capitalizing on the exoticism and "otherness" as a way to attract attention to Bolivia as an exotic and interesting place. One example is the festival developed on the shore of Lake Titicaca at the site of Compi, which counted with the parti- cipation of dance and music groups from the altiplano.2 These festivals which are often vested with a revivalist character de-contextualize and modify the way fiestas are traditionally celebrated in the communities. Nevertheless, festivals of traditional music have spawned everywhere.3 As Buechler puts it, the festivals in the city and country reflected the increasing efforts of both Bolivian officials and migrants to give the Aymara and Quechua peasants a national identity and to have the Aymara and Quechua languages accepted as part of the national heritage (Buechler 1971: 87). In the early 1960s social dynamics opened a space where the urban upper classes were more exposed to the relocation of native forms through the concept of "peinafolkldrica" incarnated in the creation of pefas, urban venues where people could go and hear live folk music artists. Peias emphasized the separation between a public, notably urban middle class but also foreign, and the artists in a relationship of musicians/audience. The audiences wanted musicafolklorica but not in the raw, and the peias opened up the receptivity of a certain public to a specific kind of music. To a certain extent the musicians molded their aesthetics to the expectations of the new audiences. It was in the penas that new and creative artists gained recognition</page><page sequence="5">56 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui. Los Kjarkas and new exploratory steps were taken. In the peias certain practices became the norm: the "Andean ensemble" consisting of guitar, charango, bombo, and qena was standardized. The music developed at the penas embodied and reflected in many ways the tenets of the ideology of integration. One fundamental way to achieve it was to incorporate other native musical instruments into the ensemble. Being featured as solo instruments at first, and then as virtuoso instruments they were mixed with other non-indigenous instruments, thus breaking the traditional use in the rural "natural" context. Native instruments, which in the context of rural community music conform to a normative mode of performance, acquired a different kind of meaning in the city. This is the case of the panpipe, or siku, in the city called by the Spanish name Zampona. In a rural "natural" context, sikus (as are almost all other wind instruments), are played communally, integratively, and are associated with specific occasions of the yearly calendric cycle as part in general of a symbolic system coherent with other aspects of the native cosmology. In the city, while connoting authenticity, Indianness and by extension, Andeanness, the instruments are imbued concurrently with city values: individuality and virtuosity versus communality. A case in point is the qena, which became the staple melody-carrier in all the groups that played musica fol- kl6rica. Whereas in the 1940s the qena had remained circumscribed to the criollo "estudiantina" ensembles, it was not until the 1960s that it became such a popular and ubiquitous instrument. The siku quickly followed, and the 1970s saw a boom of these wind instruments throughout Bolivia, as dozens of musical groups were formed locally, disintegrated, reintegrated, and either became popular or died. While the artists were creating a space for self-expression, their music was becoming a commodity as consummable "folklore." This "folklore" has flourished in a number of directions in the course of the last twenty years; primarily, because it became an avenue of expression for many musicians who have channeled their own creativity in this idiom. A con- siderable number of music groups have made names for themselves through innovations, additions, modifications, and by imitating one another from a common stock, i.e., the wealth of the traditional repertoires. The different kinds of music groups representing new currents viewed in their innovative versions their view of what folklore music was supposed to represent: an affirmation of a Bolivian identity as a defense against a perceived outside cultural intrusion and colonialism as well as the recog- nition and legitimization of the peasant Aymara and Quechua music in the city, mediated in the realm of a new sound (Cespedes 1984; see also Leichtman 1989, 29-52). In an earlier work (1984) I discussed the different approaches taken by the groups of different persuasions: Grupo Aymara and its experimentation on the sounds of the panpipes; Grupo Wara and its</page><page sequence="6">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 57 use of electronic instruments; Grupo Savia Andina, the "virtuosi" of the different instruments, and its innovative arrangements; the "purists," who only played authentic versions of Aymara peasant music; and various others. Los Kjarkas: A Sign of Bolivian Integration? Los Kjarkas appeared on the horizon in the wake of the changes outlined above. The group is composed of six musicians from the valley region of Cochabamba. Three members are brothers: Gonzalo Hermosa, the elder poet, composer, and spokesman for the group, Ulises Hermosa,4 also poet and composer, and Elmer Hermosa, the lead singer. The bulk of the com- positions belong to these brothers. Other musicians are Fernando Torrico, Gaston Guardia, and Edwin Castellanos. They are all polished and versatile instrumentalists, write songs, and play exclusively their own compositions. Well-versed bilingual speakers of both Spanish and Quechua, they use the languages in a poetic manner in their compsitions, exhibiting a very per- sonal style imitated by many followers. Los Kjarkas have operated a music school in Cochabamba for many years, thus contributing to the formation of a whole generation of young musicians who in turn have spun off to form their own groups. There are many ways in which Los Kjarkas inscribe, assert, and package their Bolivian identity.5 Not surprisingly, one of the ways is to appeal to an ancient, pre-Columbian past. Their logo, "Kjarkas," is cast using the icono- graphic symbols present in the stylized anthropomorphic condor or warriors carved on the stone of the Gate of the Sun at Tiwanaku, an archaeological site from the pre-Inca Tiwanaku era: Figure 1. Los Kjarkas Logo The Tiwanaku symbols are instantly recognized as belonging to a millenary culture, the site of which is the heart of the Andes and Bolivia. As such they are ubiquitously and almost indiscriminately used by travel agencies, jewelry stores, hotels, restaurants, importers, and so on. With this logo, Los Kjarkas too can rightfully invoke the past thus situating themselves as part of the more remote history of the Andean heritage.</page><page sequence="7">58 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui. Los Kjarkas The name they chose, Kjarkas, refers to the name of Pre-Spanish fortresses built by the Inca to protect against outward invasions. Therefore, Kjarkas "fortress" implies an indigenous bastion of strength and resistance. Los Kjarkas are true to what has become the norm in most groups that play mtusicafolkl6rica; they present themselves in concert attired in ponchos, a visual overt referent to their Andeanness. In many of their earlier records, the back of the jackets reproduce a photograph of Los Kjarkas standing on a rock wearing ponchos with Tiwanaku designs embroidered, and holding panpipes, the most iconographically Andean of all instruments. They are not just holding any panpipes, but the giant and deep sounding Toyos as well as one of the large wankara drums (Fig. 2). These overt uses of indigenous Andean symbols characterize Los Kjarkas as folkl6rico musicians deeply rooted in an ancient past. Figure 2.</page><page sequence="8">Gilka Wara Cdspedes : 59 Composition and Encoding Los Kjarkas are well aware of what they represent-Bolivia in her music for an audience that is primarily Bolivian. But they also represent them- selves. The aesthetic underpinnings of their music hinge on an interplay between a claim to both authenticity and innovation. The adherence to authenticity allows them to evoke the element of recognition in the listener, while the innovative opens up a new area of experimentation and inter- pretation. By authenticity is meant the effort to reproduce in the music those stylistic elements that place a piece within a specific recognizable form, while the innovative rests on their ability to recast those features in an idiom and a sound that is very "Kjarkas." This is one of the reasons why Los Kjarkas are viewed as "modern," particularly among the youth. Two interrelated concepts guide the creative work of Los Kjarkas: the first is what they call "proyeccion de la audiencia" (audience projection). In other words, they target the audience to whom a song will appeal the most. They are well aware of the socio-economic group in which the song will resonate by means of what they call "zonificacion." This in simple terms signifies that the group will compose in a regional style that is faithful to the formal genre of that particular region. They will undertake a "sociological study" of the Bolivian people and "project" a song by incorporating all the stylistic elements of a particular geographic region into a song. To achieve this ideal the group interrelates two aspects: by keeping true to and respecting the authenticity of the genre and by adding their innovative additions, arrange- ments, or recasts of those genres. In a recording session in which I inter- viewed them (1984), they were recording a "Kaluyo," a genre from the central valley region of Bolivia. In the words of Gonzalo Hermosa: En este disco que estamos sacando, la proyecci6n de la audiencia es mas popular. Nosotros catalogamos, si se quiere, al final de cuentas hacemos estudios sociologicos del hombre Boliviano, jno? Este Kaluyo, por ejemplo, es de la zona central de Bolivia. Significa Omayrapa, Mairana, Vallegrande, Pucara, Pasorapa, Aiquile y aledafios, mno? Eso seria la parte central que toma esto. Este seria un Kaluyo extractado casi con todos los elementos y los valores culturales de la zona. El sistema de bajos, el charango, el charanguito que va a entrar, con el sistema de rasguido que alla usan. In this record we are making, the projection of the audience is more popular. We catalog, if you will, all said and done, we do sociological studies of the Bolivian people, you know? This Kaluyo for instance is from the central region of Bolivia. This means Omayrapa, Mairana, Vallegrande, Pucara, Pasorapa, Aiquile and the surrounding areas, right? This central part will receive it. This Kaluyo would have been extracted almost with all the elements and cultural values of the region (de la zona): what kind of bajo to use, the kind of charango, when the other charango is to come in, the local strumming style.</page><page sequence="9">60 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas Los Kjarkas have the ability to insist on the stereotype and then do some- thing unusual and subvert it. They are well aware of the reception each of their compositions will have. Eso no quiere decir que estamos preparando ese tema para esa zona, sino estamos tratando mas bien de representar esa zona en la musica boliviana. Y no s6lo quiere decir que ese tema se va a llegar a vender a Vallegrande, a Mairana, que es un mercado muy reducido, que digamos, . . . ellos lo van a tomar de seguro, depende de la calidad de la musica que se haga, y ello por que la principal letra tiene elementos de poema, elementos de musica que estan realmente hechos a medida para la zona. Pero no solo van a querer digamos esto en La Paz, seguramente la gente del pueblo lo va tomar. En Oruro, Potosi, Tarija, en Cochabamaba y en Sucre lo van a recibir como una cosa. Eso quiere decir que la musica zonificada no s6lo sirve para la zona sino tambien que atraves del sentimiento de lo que se quiere expresar va a llegar a cundir toda una vasta zona, tremendamente. (Personal interview, 1984) This does not mean that we are composing this song for that region, rather, we are trying to represent that region in Bolivian music. And that means, that it will be well received not only in the the region it came from, for sure it's going to be received there, depending on the quality of the music, because it (our song) has lyrics with the poetic and musical elements that belong to the region. . . . But in La Paz surely the popular sectors will receive it. In Oruro, Potosi, Tarija, Cochabamba, and Sucre, they are going to receive it as something else. It means that "zonificaci6n" is not only regional, but through the sentiments it wishes to express, it's going to spread everywhere tremendously. With these arguments Gonzalo Hermosa acknowledges two dimensions of musical meaning: 1) a localized, identifiable, and recognizable dimen- sion that can be understood in specific terms at a circumscribed, and local level, and 2) another more general dimension that transcends the imme- diate geographic and cultural boundaries. In his own words, Hermosa provides a ground where interpretation of the musical creations is open to a number of "interpretive moves" on the part of their audiences. This also explains in some measure why some songs are more successful than others. Los Kjarkas are much more familiar and experienced in the music from the valley regions than the highlands, and the appeal to authenticity fits better those styles that they know best. Los Kjarkas are viewed as musicians who play 'folklore." Gonzalo Hermosa has very definite ideas about the concept: El folklore significa para mi la esencia de un pueblo, que viene a ser casi la cultura de un pueblo en una forma un poco reducida, nada mas. La cultura y folklore casi vienen a ser un mismo caj6n, la tapa es mas grande. En el folk- lore la cultura seria en realidad la palabra mas mayor, no? Que comprende</page><page sequence="10">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 61 el folklore y todo. No es solamente cantar. Entonces la cultura vendria a ser la tradici6n, quiero decir es la tradici6n. La tradici6n que no es s6lo cantar, la forma de hacer herencia, de enamorarse, de casarse, de hablar de comer, de preparar las comidas como los chairos, etcetera. Nuestro derecho que no esta registrado, un derecho que se ejerce entre el pueblo que no siempre esta escrito en nuestras leyes. Fuera de nuestras leyes hay otras leyes que se ejercitan en el pueblo. Tambien toma esto. La forma de cantar, la forma de ser, la forma de alegrarse, la forma de bailar, de ir a dar serenata, o no dar serenata, o despues de un chicharr6n tomarse una tutuma de chicha, o de vino, entonces son reglas que han hecho que el folklore sea la personificaci6n y la personalidad de un pueblo, ,no? De vestirse, de peinarse, de tomar las cosas buenas o malas, todo eso es folklore. (Personal interview, 1984) For me, folklore means the essence of a people, which is the culture of a peo- ple somewhat reduced, culture and folklore fit in the same box, only the cover is bigger. In folklore, culture would be a larger statement, which comprises folklore. It's not just singing, in folklore is tradition, I mean, is the tradition, not only to sing, but how to make the heritage, how to fall in love, to get married, to talk, to eat, to prepare food, like the chairos, (a local dish) etcetera. And much more. Our right, which is not written out . . ., a right that is exercised by the people but is not written in the codices, in our laws. Beyond our laws there are other laws which the people exercise. That's it. The way to sing, the way to be, the way to be happy, the way to dance, the way to go serenading, or not to go, after a chicharron to drink a tutuma of chicha, or of wine, these are the rules that folklore has made and are the personification and the personality of a people, right? The way to dress, to wear one's hair, to take the good and the bad things, all that is folklore. How these thoughts and beliefs extend to music is further explicated as the historical layers from which the genealogies of the different genres and styles are traced and melded together. In the old dichotomy of Spanish versus native, ultimately provenance does not matter. Gonzalo Hermosa does not make taxonomic distinctions between genres. Concerning muzsica criolla, he says: La musica criolla es parte del folklore. Muchas cosas las esta aprendiendo uno mismo y estan formando parte de nuestro comuin hacer de los hombres. . . .Para mi no hay divisiones entre musico criolla y musica aut6ctona. Al final de cuentas, ambas son autoctonas. Al tratar de dividir la musica ya seria remontarse mucho mas lejanamente en el tiempo y posteriomente vendria a ser la musica criollizada, que nuestra historia siempre ha conse- guido, jno? La saya, la cueca son cosas criollas que han nacido, digamos, de mestizajes. El mestizaje vendria a ser una musica criolla. Y algunas cosas se han mantenido puras, por ejemplo el huayio. El huayiio es lo que mas se ha mantenido puro. (Personal interview, 1984) Criolla music is part of folklore. All that we learn forms part of the common doing of humankind. There are no distinctions. For me there are no distinctions</page><page sequence="11">62 : Huayio, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas between musica criolla and musica aut6ctona. When all is said and done, both are autoctonas. If we try to divide our music, we would need to go so far back in time, but our history has always had criollo music, right? Saya, cueca are criollo things that have come about as mestizajes. Mestizaje is a criollo music. Some things have maintained pure, like the huayio, for example. Huayio is the purest of all. Gonzalo Hermosa conceives identity as shaped around the cognitive, the affective, and the pragmatic. The way we know, the way we feel, and the way we do things makes us what we are: La cultura tambien es asi. No son cosas estaticas, no son que en un tiempo ha ocurrido y ahi se ha quedado eno? . . . A los bolivianos nos falta conocer nuestro pueblo, nuestra cultura, nuestra forma de ser. Para ubicarnos en el tiempo y en el espacio y en la persona. Para saber, porque eres Boliviano: Porque he nacido en Bolivia? Eso es lo mas absurdo que pueda haber. El hecho de nacer no te da ningun derecho a ser Boliviano. Yo soy boliviano porque hago esto, hago esto, siento de esta forma, de esta forma hago lo otro, como chairos, hago jolkkes, ique se yo! Culture is like this, they [cultural forms] are not static things, not as if once they happened they are going to stay the same, no? . . . We need to know our peo- ple, our culture, our way. In order to place ourselves in time and in space, as well as in the person. To know why I am a Bolivian because I was bor in Bolivia? Just to be born in Bolivia doesn't make one a Bolivian, this is absurd: I am Bolivian because I do things this way, because I feel this way, I do this other in this way. I eat chairos (a local dish), makejolkke, whatever. A strong sense of self also plays an important role in the way one makes music. When talking about other groups who are involved in musica fol- klorica, he says: A mi lo que me interesa de un grupo es su identidad con uno mismo, si se quiere decir, se podria l1amar su verdad. Estar de acuerdo con uno mismo. Eso es muy importante. Si tu estas sintiendo los lineamientos que tu te has trazado, no porque te han obligado, sino porque tu estas queriendo ver, ese es un tipo bueno .... Ahora cual seria mejor, si entre nosotros o entre ellos. . . .Lo importante es tener una idea de visi6n, de concebir las cosas. Si para unos es amarillo y se inclinan al amarillo, bien. Y si nosotros es gris, es gris, dno? jCual es mejor, el gris o el amarillo? Los dos son buenos. El amarillo entre los amarillos es bueno, el gris entre los grises, no habria porque hacerlo cambiar. (Personal interview, 1984) What I'm most interested in a group is its self-identity, its truth, if you will. To be in agreement with oneself. This is very important. If you feel along the lines that you have set for yourself, not because you are forced to, but because it's your own soul searching, this is good. I don't know which is best, them or us. The important thing is to have a vision, a way to conceive things. If for some it's yellow and they tend toward yellow, fine. If for us it's grey, it's grey,</page><page sequence="12">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 63 right? Which is better, grey or yellow? Among the yellows, the yellow is good, among the grey, the grey is equally good. No reason to have it change. These are some of the very definite and well-articulated ideas that influence the musical practice of Los Kjarkas. Canto a la Mujer de Mi Pueblo: The Interplay of Music, Language, and Ideology Even though Canto a la Mujer de mi Pueblo is not their first album, it is never- theless one of the most successful and popular, and the one that brought Los Kjarkas to the foreground in the panorama of urban popular music of thefolklorica genre. The title of the album plays on the convergence in meaning of pueblo: one for people, as in a large group that can be extended to signify nation; the other for a small town or a village. The album is there- fore intended to celebrate the "woman of my people," but also the woman from the village, the campesina, the Indian, not the woman from the city. This concept is confirmed by Gonzalo: Es el canto a un tipo de mujer, a esa que es madre, que es obrera, a la que realmente es una persona muy importante, que va detras de la yunta con la semilla, es mujer en las noches, y viva, habita las soledades de nuestra tierra surefia sobre todo, esta inspirado en la tierra del sur. Si conoces esa zona, es tan hermosa, tan inhospita . . . ves pastoras, ves nifias pastoras en las sole- dades tremendamente encerradas. Y ellas aprenden pues la responsabilidad desde muy nifias . . ., y creo que es mejor homenaje que hemos rendido a este tipo de mujer, pensamos que nuestros grandes valores estan ahi, en el campo. (Personal interview, 1984) This is a song to a type of woman, the mother, the worker, the one who really is a very important person, who walks behind the mule team with the seed, is a woman at night, and lives, inhabits the solitudes of our southern lands, it's inspired in the South. If you know that region, beautiful, inhospitable, you see girls shepherding, locked in the vast solitudes. And they learn responsi- bility from a tender age. ... I think it's the best homage we can pay to this type of woman. We think our greatest values reside in the campo. This intended meaning is conveyed in the record jacket, showing a young Indian woman sitting on the ground, dressed in fiesta garb, her handwoven "llijlla" with the distinctive regional designs, clearly a campesina and not a mestiza. Behind her are a few men, out of focus but clearly campesinos as well (Fig. 3). The indigenous element in the foreground of this album is further in- dexed by the choice of the music. The album contains ten pieces, seven of which are huaynos. Gonzalo Hermosa himself believes in the "untarnished" properties of the huayno, when discussing Bolivian musical genres:</page><page sequence="13">64 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas Figure 3. Algunas cosas se han mantenido puras, por ejemplo el Huayfio. El Huayfio es lo que mas se ha mantenido puro. Some things have remained pure. For example Huayio. Huayiio has re- mained the purest of all. (Interview, 1984). Therefore for Hermosa, the genre huayho already means unpolluted, un- touched, pristine, and authentic. The other pieces are two Chuntunquis and one saya. The saya will be discussed in the second part of this article. Significantly, none of the pieces are of the mestizo genre such as the cueca, which has a distinct history, associations, and practice. The album breaks down into: Side A: 1. Wa Ya Yay (huayfio) 2. Siempre he de adorarte (chuntunqui) 3. Por Un Mundo Nuevo (huayiio) 4. Tata Sabaya (huayfio) 5. Phuru Runas (juayno) Side B: 1. Surimana (huayno) 2. Canto a la Mujer de Mi Pueblo (chuntunqui) 3. Llorando se Fue (saya) 4. Mamita Surumi (huayiio) 5. Capinotefia (huayfio)</page><page sequence="14">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 65 Among the musical contributions of Los Kjarkas perhaps the most inno- vative and appealing is the popularizing of a regional genre, the Chuntunqui, which first appears in this album and is widely used in subsequent albums. This is a local genre from the central valley area of Chuquisaca associated with music played at Christmas time, "mal llamado Villancico Chuquisaqueno," (ill-named Chuquisaca Villancico) says Hermosa. It is one of the very few rhythms in 6/8 otherwise present in Bolivian folk and criolla music in its Hispanic-derived cuecas, bailecitos, and carnavalitos. Cueca and bailecito are "courtship dances" that belong to the same types as the carnavalito and the chacarera in Argentina. These embody a machista narrative accompanying a dance that suggests an imagery of conquest and domination of the female. These forms usually have a set harmonic formula of I-IV-V-I and a ternary rhythm in which an interspersed hemiola is the characteristic feature. As an alternative to these musical narratives represented in the cuecas, bailecitos, and carnavalitos, a Los Kjarkas' Chuntunqui provides a ternary rhythm that stands in contrast to the aforementioned forms, while inserting itself in the larger picture of Latin American forms. The Chuntunqui breaks with the linearity of the musical narrative of the ternary meter cueca and bailecito by its simultaneity of cross rhythm of threes against twos, by the alternative harmonic schemes, and by a typical Kjarkas instrumentation that empha- sizes the brilliance and transparency of the stringed instruments. Chun- tunquis occupy about one third of the selections of each album of Los Kjarkas. Los Kjarkas do not really play many cuecas: the reason may be that cueca presents structural constraints, whereas Chuntunqui opens an avenue of flexibility. In instrumental forms such as something as simple as a Huayio, there will be an excursion through several sequences of tones through different tonal centers that make the music such a novelty. The album Canto is one such example. Musically the group strategy makes the listener comfortable by insisting on what is well known and recognizable and then introduces a space of innovation and non-recognition. Los Kjarkas' sound is also inno- vative in the way they privilege a dense texture; there are no "empty spaces" unfilled by the brilliance of a charango embroidering the main lines. Los Kjarkas come from a tradition where stringed instruments are the preferred medium. In concert, there are at least two guitars, one charango and a roncoco, a larger sort of bass charango. One way in which authoctonous music references itself is by relying on very specific closing formulas, or even micro-motifs that identify one genre from another. Los Kjarkas know this principle in general and use it. The appeal to the stereotype is clearly present in their casting many of their songs at least partially in a pentatonic mode. This allows them to engage in specific progressions and closing formulas that give the songs their "Andean" signature and to explore various possibilities at different kinds of</page><page sequence="15">66 : Huayio, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas developments and closures. Typically, at the point where one would expect a closure by a movement V-I, the great majority of the songs close in a VII-I. This one whole step rather than a skip points to another type of modality. One of the musical strategies Los Kjarkas use is to circumvent the basic I-IV-V folk-music formula, extremely common in the genres. It would seem that they go out of the way to avoid those specific tone pro- gressions and replace them with others, for example I-IV-VI-III. This is a novel approach to harmonic progressions that renders it very appealing. The Construction of Gender Los Kjarkas are romanticones (romantics at heart) when it comes to their perception of women. They sing with great fervor about the quest for love, the attainment of love, the loss of love. The album Canto reaffirms a romantic idealized image of the woman who inhabits the realm of the sentiments. To a degree, it also repeats the major theme in Andean ideation, the identification of woman with earth. The earth, Pachamama, is mother of all living things, and all daily acts are suffused and permeated with this idea. These ideas are collapsed into one as the songs to the woman in this album are directed to the campesina who is also viewed as being closer to nature, closer to the earth, and identified with it.

In regards to the spiritual features, the woman's love is also associated with a natural force-fire-but the fire of the hearth is a contained fire. There is also the association be- tween love and song, and her song, like her body, is part of the world of nature. The winds carry it away through hills and mountains; her song, like the earth, has the tenderness of a mother. The song plays on two sets of relationships associated with and crystallized in the image of the woman, her affinity with the earth, and her affinity with love. But she is lonely and sad and needs to be awakened. It is presumed that love, in the form of a man, will come and awaken her. Siempre he de adorarte (Chuntunqui) Siempre he de adorarte tiernamente Eres el milagro de este amor No podre alejarte de mi mente te llevo prendida en el coraz6n Si tu amor lleg6 a mi vida para ser feliz mis dias y el mundo que he formado para ti.

Without your love life is lost There is no consolation in my misfortune. Il1 look for your love And in the heart lives Hope forever alight. In this Chuntunqui the woman, situated in an aethereal region is evoked in love. The lyrics always utilize a direct form of address to the woman. (The only time in this album that a concrete place is mentioned occurs in the song "Capinotefia," which says: "among the flowers in my garden / I prefer the dark ones / the ones from Capinota / to love you / to lose you / I prefer death.')</page><page sequence="19">70 : Huayio, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas Por un Mundo Mdor (huayfio) Todo en esta vida tiene un fin que conseguir Son designios que se tienen que cumplir iVen! que debemos mejorar El mundo en que vamos a habitar iVamos! nuestra vida empieza aqui y nos aguarda el porvenir En un mundo ciego en que nos toco vivir Buscaremos una vida sin temor iVen! que debemos mejorar Juntos por la tierra buscaremos un lugar el lugar donde formemos nuestro hogar Ven, que debemos mejorar Que feliz soy mientras sonries y me abrazas con amor Everything in this life has an end to attain Designs we must accomplish Come!

We must better Together on this earth well look for a place the place where well make our home Come! We must better How happy I am while you smile and embrace me with love This song addresses a larger issue. A song of hope, as Gonzalo Hermosa explained, in view of the uncertain future on this earth, always on the verge of calamity, as the earth is menaced, and life will disappear. The many other songs of love by Los Kjarkas are in the same vein. However, in these and many other songs, there are themes that do not get treated. It is significant, for example, that compared to other musical cul- tures in Latin America, (the romantic music of the tropical countries for example which make reference to sex and sexuality overtly, riddled with metaphors and double entendres) the songs of Los Kjarkas stay at the sentimental, non-sexual level. The physical attributes of the woman sung to are the eyes, the hands, the face, the braids, the color of the skin. In a public presentation Gonzalo Hermosa introduced this song: "A los ojos maravillosos que son la ventana del alma" (to the marvelous eyes which are the window to the soul): Chuntunqui Dejame mirarte por esa ventana que por las mafianas yo veo en tus ojos el brillo de tu alma color solitario Let me look at you through that window I see everyday in your eyes the glow of your solitary-colored soul</page><page sequence="20">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 71 dejame decirte que en mis pensamientos yo Ulevo tus suenios y tus sentimientos y mi alma siente morirse, pequefia quiero hablarte de mi tierra quiero' hablarte de rios y suefios celestes hablarte del viento y sus cantares del amor de las flores a la tierra mojada dejame mirarte por esa ventana let me tell you that in my thoughts I carry your dreams and your sentiments and my soul feels like dying, little one I want to talk to you about my land Talk to you about rivers and blue dreams talk to you about the wind and its song of the love flowers have for the damp earth let me look at you through that window However, core features of women's lives and experiences, such as children and hard work, do not form part of the discourse of Los Kjarkas. The image of the real woman, with a child on her back and/or at her hand, sell- ing goods at the market or in the street is the most ubiquitous both in the city and in the country, and impossible not to see, to respond to, and to interact with. How this most obvious feature and proof of an active sexuality is glossed over is significant. Los Kjarkas are singing to an ideal woman, to their image of the bucolic campesina, who has stayed in the campo. The object of desire is obviously the nubile, beautiful, but sad, maiden awaiting to be awakened (residues of nineteenth-century romanticism?). Are these other real women so hard to see? Or do Los Kjarkas not want to see this other side? What kinds of messages are being sent? In addition, what contradiction is inherent in equating the woman with the Mother Earth, Pachamama, whose most prominent attribute is that of fertility and the giving and sustaining of life, but implicitly negating it in the woman? Or is it the reverse, that is, they are so well aware of all these things that they hardly need mentioning, and ultimately it is only the sentimental attach- ment that counts? Gonzalo himself provides a partial answer to these questions, subscribing to the latter, indirectly addressing the issue: Yo pienso que hay un mont6n de canciones que hablan de eso. L6gico, no entran los hijos ... el hombre mismo en su contexto general involucra a la mujer. Cuando el hombre conquista la luna no significa que sea el var6n el que ha conquistado la luna, sino la raza humana del hombre. El sin6nimo del hombre significa mas que todo los dos sexos. L6gico, la parte mas her- mosa siempre es la epoca del cual uno es enamorado. Hay un mont6n de razones . . . hay otras cosas que en si llevan implicitas. Nosotros no hacemos panfleto, ano? (Personal interview, 1992) I think we have many songs that deal with that. Of course, children are not a</page><page sequence="21">72 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui. Los Kjarkas part of it . . . man in his general context is invariably associated with the woman. When man conquers the moon it does not mean the male, but the whole human race. Man is synonym for both sexes. Of course, the most beautiful part is when one is in love. There are many reasons . . . other things are implicit. This statement essentially reflects the male voice with which Los Kjarkas speak, placing them within the romantic-love song tradition and away from the types of songs from Canto Nuevo, which would address those themes directly. Another side of this issue is represented in their later album Los Andes . . .Descubrio su Rostro Milenario 1990 (The Andes . . . discovered their millenary countenance). The title of this album presents an ambiguity at the outset contained in the word descubrio, which could be defined as either "discovered," something that is "found," or as meaning "revealed," the Andes reveal themselves/the Andes discover themselves. Either way it is an imposing, formidable title that suggests a journey into the remotest past and into one's millenary roots. Likewise, the jacket pictures a close-up of a man, clearly an Aymara, looking directly at the viewer, all in a red chiaro- scuro and illuminated behind by the dim firelight. The back side of the jacket features a reproduction of the designs of a regional weaving, pos- sibly from Potosi. But in spite of this staid, sober package not a single song has the remotest reference to the apparent message this image conveys. The album is really a collection of love songs: "Puedo vivir sin tu amor"; "Duele"; 'Todo me habla de ti"; 'Tus 15 afios y yo"; 'Nifia de mi Tierra"; "Sefiora su hija"; "S6lo yo he ganado"; "Santusay." The only exceptions are 'Tupiza," a song to a southern town but still peripherally a love song, and 'Jilguero Flores," a song about a poet. The recurring themes are of unre- quited love or lost love and the love for a fifteen-year-old. Many questions arise in this respect. Why do Los Kjarkas need to invoke the imagery of ethnic ancestry in order to put forth a collection of love songs? Of course, love songs really sell, and Los Kjarkas use the image they project to sell their songs. Gonzalo sees their treatment of music and text as a medium to revindicate national music to the next generation: Esa letra esta directamente para chicas de quince, dieciseis, diecisiete, dieci- ocho aios. Esas personitas de 15-17 afios jamas querian saber de la musica boliviana. S6lo los viejitos se acordaban de sus bailecitos, de sus cuecas; y tampoco no los dejaban expresar pues, no los dejaban expresar .... Porque entr6 ahi la nueva ola, la melena, la guitarra electrica y todas esas cosas y empez6. Y el instrumento de alienaci6n gratuito siempre ha sido la radio y la televisi6n, y actualmente lo consigue. The lyrics are directed toward fifteen-, sixteen-, seventeen-, eighteen-year- old girls. Those young people never wanted to know about Bolivian music. Only the older people remembered their bailecitos, their cuecas, and they weren't permitted to express that either, . . . because in came the new wave,</page><page sequence="22">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 73 the long hair, the electric guitar and all of that, and that's where it started. And the most effective alienating tool has always been the radio and televi- sion, and actually it succeeds. We should then not jump to hasty conclusions and take Gonzalo at his word: the packaging and the subjects dealt with, though incongruous with one another, are a vehicle to draw younger listeners and to find and adopt a musical medium of expression that is Bolivian. Language: Quechua/Aymara Los Kjarkas sing mostly in Spanish, although some songs are in Quechua. The use of the native language is one of the ways to locate the music in its "authentic mode." Its use reinforces and enlarges the ambient of expression. Moreover, in the use of the native language, there are qualities in the per- formative aspect that repeat the expressive traits proper to the rendition of the song. A multitude of feelings that the language implies and contains is also brought in, with occasionally suppressed elements in the culture of the dominant language. For example, it is not uncommon in real life for men to cry about a lost love, particularly if the emotions have been heightened by the consumption of alcohol, a widespread practice. The singing in these cases acquires a characteristic plaintive, lamenting character. The verse of "Surimana" is in Quechua; Elmer Hermosa is quite successful in the rendition of those qualities. Surimana (huayho) Waqay kutipis saqerparerkani Ama riupychu waqaspa niwarqa Sapa paqarin yuyarispa kani yuyarispa sonqoypis waqani Ay yo no quiero saber de tu olvido Ay no quisiera saber de tu olvido acaso piensas que yo no estoy contigo Deja tu orgullo y andate conmigo Quiero tenerte siempre aqui a mi lado No dejes nunca que tu amor me falte Porque sin ti vivir no podria Regresa a mi, flor del alma mia I left her (distraught, drowned in tears) don't leave, crying she said every day I'm waiting waiting while my heart weeps I don't want to hear of your for- getting me I don't want to hear of your oblivion Do you think I am not with you? Leave your pride and come with me I want you always by my side don't deny me your love because without you I couldn't live come back to me flower of my soul Los Kjarkas do not sing in Aymara, since they are from the Quechua- speaking valley region of Bolivia. Yet, one of the most successful songs in</page><page sequence="23">74 : Huayho, Saya, and Chuntunqui. Los Kjarkas the album is Wa ya yay, which implicitly touches upon the boundaries between speech and song. The Aymara language offers a rich panorama of sound iconicities that appear consistently through onomatopoeic instances. Descriptions in Aymara are peppered with colorful expressions that evoke sound-meaning relationships. This feature lends to the language expressive elements not always present in other languages. Aymara is full of the ono- matopoeic use of words: certain words suggest meanings by association of their sound with the targeted effect. In English some of those words (much highlighted in comic-book stories) such as thud, splash, and splat suggest in a broad sense a sound relationship determined by what kind of an object falls on what kind of surface. In the Aymara language there are expletives asso- ciated with different kinds of pain. In Aymara the equivalent of the English ouch would be expressed in different ways: thus, in the expletive Achachau, "ch" is associated with pain caused by a burn or a sting; change the sound to an "L," and the association is with the discomfort caused by cold. Alalau means "I'm very cold" or any variation thereof. The sound 'T" is associated with a sharp pain, such as when one would hit one's thumb with a hammer or stub one's toe on a rock; Atatau would be the expletive. Similarly, we can infer other types of sound and meaning correspon- dences in Aymara. The particle "Wa" is in this sense very important, because there seems to be a lexical semantic component attached to this sound, involving a domain having to do with crying, but also with singing. The old Bertonia Aymara vocabulary shows these entries (hua= wa, modern spelling): Hua = cry/crying huararitha huararaatha huararihachatha huararihuasaitha hurarintatha huararicatatha huararimucutha huararistacatha huararithaptatha huararitatha llorar a gritos hazer dar gritos tener ganas de dar gritos dar muchos gritos como quando cogen a la zorra o lobo que hurta entrar dando gritos en alguna casa llegarse gritando echar gritos encontrarse con alguno, o salirse al encuentro dando gritos juntarse los que dan gritos alcar el grito repentina- mente uno o muchos to weep loudly (with cries) to cause someone to cry to have the urge to cry to emit many cries as when catching a fox stealing to enter into a house crying to arrive crying to let out cries to meet someone, or go meet them letting out cries to bring together the crying ones for one or many to suddenly let out a cry</page><page sequence="24">Gilka Wara Cdspedes : 75 Hua = song/singing huaruru kochu, canci6n o cantar kochu, song and singing de indios of Indians huarurutha cantar asi to sing like this huarurumucutha gastar mucho tiempo en to spend a lot of time cantar y decir canciones singing and reciting songs huarurunocatha idem idem huaruruntatha entrar cantando to come in singing huaruruthaptatha encontrarse cantando los for two groups coming que van y vienen and going to meet while singing Whenever there are no words to a song, or one does not know the words, it is standard practice to substitute syllables to fill in. Among the Aymara the preferred manner is to use the syllable 'Way," and it would be incon- gruous to use anything else. (In Spanish it is generally "Lai-ra-ra-ray.") In view of the points discussed above, it would seem that the use of 'Way" is not altogether an arbitrary choice, but instead, it has a lot to do with the semantic component of this sound and its iconic, affective, properties. 'Wa-ya-yay" is delivered in the same general plaintive, lamenting, wept style described above. Moreover, it is more frequently used by women since in the practice of music, singing is the domain of women while the playing of instruments is that of men. In the context of a fiesta in an alti- plano town or community, women participate very actively in the music- making and in the fervor of the fiesta, and as much inebriated as the men, the emotions rise to a high level. 'Way-ya-yay" is present both as a song but also as a lament. The styles in which emotions are expressed are cul- turally inscribed. One particular instance in my own fieldwork during a 1983 fiesta in which I was researching Sikuri music, at the height of the action, a group of women were seated on the ground as is customary among the Aymara, men and women occupying separate spaces. My attention was drawn to the way one of the women, as she was telling her story, wove in and out between a weeping telling of her story, and she would then break into song, using 'wa-ya-yay," turning back to tell the rest of the story, again, in the same weeping style, and breaking back into the 'vay ya yay." This went on for quite awhile. Los Kjarkas know this in an unconscious manner. One of the biggest hits that took the city and the country by surprise was their song, composed by Ulises Hermosa, 'Wa ya yay." Deceptively simple, with this particular song they have tapped directly into one of the most important expressive veins of how things are said in the Altiplano. Important expressive elements intersect at several levels: the lyrical, the musical, and the emotional. At</page><page sequence="25">76 : Huayio, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas the level of the lyrics, the first verse tells about the singer's emotional state, of pain, sorrow, loneliness, disappointment. This is an introverted verse: Voy a contarte hoy mi triste pena La soledad que hoy llevo en mi alma Voy a contarte de tristes desenganios De ilusiones y de suenios que he vivido I am going to tell you about my pain The loneliness I carry in my soul I'm going to tell you about my sad disappointment About the dreams and illusions I have lived In the second verse the speaker has not said anything yet, but moves on to tell about his environment, mountains, and valleys and, most of all, the source of the most significant musical and emotional symbols: he was cradled by huaynos and saw the land itself bloom in the charango and the panpipes grow in the wind. Entre montafias y valles he nacido Me acunaron los huayiios en su encanto Y al florecer mi tierra en su charango Vi crecer las zampofias en el viento I was born between mountains and valleys the Huayfios cradled me in their enchantment And when the earth bloomed in her charango I saw the panpipes grow in the wind Now the emotional state of the first verse and the musical materials of the second are going to find their expression in the third verse and the rest of the song that consists entirely of 'Wa-ya-yay": Wa ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yay wa ya yay Wa ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yay Wa ya yay way, way wa ya ya ya yay way ya yay, way, way wa ya yay Wa ya ya ya ya ya yay wa ya yay wa ya yay This song pays hommage to the Aymara of the highlands. The song is a huayfio, and the first part of the melody is pentatonic, indexing in this way Aymara music. The song ends with the typical closure of a sikuri piece quoting the typical exchange between the Arca and the Ira (the pair of complementary panpipes). To the surprise of the group, the song became extremely popular in many places including outside the national borders.

El wa ya yay es pues un simbolismo, con s6lo decir wa-ya-yay es pues el aymara .... ya no necesita mas letra, apoyo de ninguna letra. Y te digo que con el wa ya yay hemos tenido fen6menos muy curiosos. Cuando estamos en el extranjero, en una cultura muy diferente y con otro idioma, se canta el wa ya yay que siempre hemos cantado al final, la gente sale tonadeando y se les va pegado. Entonces yo pienso mas bien que esa canci6n es el origen primo de una esencia natural del hombre humano que ha quedado restricto muy adentro, que ha quedado sus restos, tocan ahi sus restos como si estu- vieran llorando. Wa ya yay is symbolic, just saying "wa ya yay" one says Aymara. It doesn't need words, or the support of any lyrics. I can tell you that with this song we have experienced curious things. When we are abroad, in a different culture, and with another language, we sing "wa ya yay," which we always sing at the end, and people leave humming it, it catches on. I think that song touches a prime response in the natural human essence that has remained very restricted, buried inside, and it touches them as a cry.

Yet, the nationalist discourse embedded in their music permits any social group to lay a claim to it and endorse it. Because the nationalism of Los Kjarkas operates at diverse sensory, cognitive, and affective levels, listeners can assign a mean- ing to it that may or may not have been there at first. A song that stands out in this respect is "Bolivia," one of the most successful songs that tugs at the feelings affecting a large number of Bolivians. "Bolivia" is a powerful song in all its simplicity. This is the most requested song at the end of a concert, and it brings the house down. Some recent comments about it have been that "this should become Bolivia's national anthem." The message is conveyed at the sonic, the poetic, and the musical levels in layers of signification, which I will lay out through my "interpretive moves." The song is cast in the rhythm of a huayno. The lyrical content of the song is a statement calling for liberation looking towards a better future. The referenced time frame, a century and a half, has to do with the inde- pendence sesquicentennial celebrations of the mid 1970s and is a commen- tary to the fact that although independence may have been declared, it has not been necessarily achieved, particularly by the oppressed group, the campesinos: Bolivia Ser tu bravura ser la fuerza y juventud de tu letargo mudo la voz, la inquietud Bolivia! quiero pegar un grito de liberaci6n despues de siglo y medio de humillaci6n Quiero tengan tus dias destino mejor y el futuro sonria prometedor Bolivia! En la falda de tus cerros hare mi hogar donde felices los nifios iran a jugar Bolivia! To be the bravery, the strength, and youth the awakening and voice of your mute lethargy Bolivia! I want to shout liberation after a century and half of humiliation. I want a better destiny for your days and that the future may smile promising Bolivia! At the foot of your mountains Ill make my home Where the children happily will go play Bolivia! The musical encoding is terse: the song starts with a simple charango establishing the huayno rhythm. Then the first verse "Ser tu bravura ser la fuerza y juventud" is sung a cappella in parallel fifths and in a pentatonic motif. Both the tone material and the parallel fifths tie in directly to one of</page><page sequence="28">Gilka Wara Cispedes : 79 the oldest panpipe traditions in the Bolivian Andes, the qantus. Qantus by themselves, stand out as the icon for Aymara identity. The second verse, "de tu letargo mudo la voz, la inquietud" moves over an instrumental accompaniment that renews and reaffirms the huayno rhythm and iconically underlines the "awakening of your mute lethargy." The chorus "Bolivia!" erupts in a triad, by this time the parallel fifths have been abandoned, and there is a closure of a IV-I progression, again the pentatonic closure is not there. The second part of the verse, "quiero pegar un grito de liberaci6n," is in complete triads, and "despues de siglo y medio de humillaci6n" is stated by the solo. The two verses are interpolated by an extended instru- mental section in which, sequentially, the wind and the stringed instruments take turns. The a cappella vocals never reappear during the rest of the song, the second verse entering over the underlying rhythmic base. This motion from the collective, a cappella, pentatonic, to the individual, instrumental, triadic statement suggests to me that Los Kjarkas in one piece of music, purely by musical means, are capable of traveling a distance that indicates text or tune relationships by referencing music-structural iconicities, such as the qantus, and performative meanings, such as the solo at the word "Liberacion!" In 1980 a most violent and gruesome coup took place in Bolivia prevent- ing the freely elected government from taking power and replacing it with a military rule in one of the most chaotic and corrupt periods in recent history. While the press was being restrained and radio stations were silenced, the only radio allowed to broadcast the government line was the official Radio Illimani. A musical signature interspersed between slices of propaganda for the "new order" was the tail end of this song. The choice of this piece was as felicitous as it was insidious: given the simple but powerful affecting character I have tried to describe, playing only the chorus of it told only part of the story. It is as if the military were now answering the call for liberation and a better future. To the people who had been deeply affected by the repressive measures of this regime this message played out like a bad joke. This same piece had been used earlier to bolster the political propaganda of the most right-wing (and dictatorial) candidate. Gonzalo sent an open letter to the effect that the use of that theme was unauthorized and that its use compromised Los Kjarkas with a political party, (and the most reac- tionary at that). Los Kjarkas no tenemos color politico. No somos del PC, ni PCB, ne del ADN, ni del MNR, ni de la Falange ni de nada. Nosotros somos del pueblo. No tenemos color. A nosotros nos interesa reivindicar a nuestro pueblo, llevarlo a otro lado y cambiar la mentalidad. Y ese cambio de mentalidad ha hecho que la misma Remedios este en el Palacio de Gobierno.6 (Personal interview, 1992)</page><page sequence="29">80 : Huayio, Saya, and Chuntunqui. Los Kjarkas Los Kjarkas don't have a political color. We are neither PC, nor PCB, nor ADN, nor MNR, nor Falange, nothing. We belong to the people. We don't have a color. Our interest is to revindicate our people, take it elsewhere and change the people's mentality. That change has made it possible for Remedios to be in the government. If there is any political involvement on the part of Los Kjarkas it is at a different level. Los Kjarkas see themselves vested with a mission, which is to shake the consciousness of their publics into an awareness of one's cultural values in reaction to the relentless bombardment of alienating messages. Of these, one of the worst is the influence of rock music. For Gonzalo rock music is the worst culprit: [La inferioridad] es un problema que todo el mundo lo conoce, la tez morena contra la piel blanca y los ojos azules. Es una enfermedad que hemos here- dado. Pero en nuestro tiempo ha habido una enfermedad mucho mas grave, la alienacion extranjerizante del rock. El rock ha empezado a traer un enfer- medad y ha traido droga tambien. Y ha empezado a querer disfigurar, a borrar lo que en trecientos afios los espafioles no nos han podido borrar. Habia un peligro inminente de borrar del mapa nuestras cuecas, nuestros huaynos y de arrinconarlos absolutamente. Porque era sin6nimo de un status inferior. (Personal interview, 1992) [Inferiority] is a well known problem, our dark skin pitted against the white skin and the blue eyes. It's an illness we have inherited. But in our time there has been a much more serious illness, the alienating influence of Rock. Rock brought in an illness, and it also brought drugs. And it started to disfigure, to erase what in three hundred years the Spaniards were not able to do. There was the imminent danger of erasing from the map our cuecas, huayfios, and to cast them aside totally. Because it was the synonym of an inferior status. Los Kjarkas credit themselves with having changed the attitudes of the people toward themselves and proudly accepting their Bolivian heritage. Nuestro primer objetivo era sacar al hombre boliviano de muchos prejuicios que tenia. Yo le llamo la enfermedad sicosocial, ;no? Renegaba de su poncho, renegaba de sus abarcas, de su piel morena, de su apellido Huanca, Mamani, Choque, que se yo . . . renegaba de su madre de pollera .... Nosotros nos hemos atribuido labores que realmente debian ser competencia de otros institutos. Pero si nadie lo hacia, quien los hacia? Nosotros lo hacemos. Esta ha sido una gran revoluci6n. Yo he dicho siempre, es la revoluci6n jamas llevada. Ni el '52 ha sido comparado con esto. Porque el '52 no se pudo cam- biar la mentalidad de hombre, entiendes? esta si la cambi6, cambi6 mentali- dades. Por eso tenemos teatros. Porque al teatro el charango no entraba, estaba vedada la zamponia, estaba vedada. Our first objective was to remove some prejudices from the Bolivian. I call it the psychosocial illness. He renounced his poncho, his abarcas (sandals),</page><page sequence="30">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 81 his dark skin, his name, Huanca, Mamani, Choque (typical Aymara names) . . denied his mother's pollera .... We have taken over a task that really ought to be the work of other institutions. But if nobody would carry it out, who would? We do. This has been a great revolution. I have always said, the never-accomplished revolution. Not even 1952 can be compared to this. Because in '52 they could not change people's attitudes, right? But this one did, it did change attitudes. That is why we now have theaters. Because the charango had no place in the theater, the zampofia was forbidden, it was forbidden. This "revoluci6n incruenta" [bloodless revolution] had to be won first in Bolivia. As far south as Tarija and as far east as Santa Cruz, Gonzalo claims that Los Kjarkas engaged in an intensive work of reviving old, almost forgotten styles. This is a recurring theme in his rhetoric. Los Kjarkas play exclusively their own compositions. The reason for this is a personal choice: rather than going the way so many of the other groups had, simply reviving pieces of the traditional repertoire, Los Kjarkas felt that they could give the music a different twist, go in with a different at- titude, and make a few changes consonant with the times: adecuar al momento historico en el cual estamos viviendo. Cambiarle la letra. Moverle un poquito a la musica, adecuar a las exigencias de ahora. adapt to the historic moment we are living now. Change the lyrics, speed up the music a little, satisfy today's expectations. The Connection with the Audience The best moments of Los Kjarkas are during a performance when the musical ideas incarnate and become alive in an act of communication. Los Kjarkas are communicative, warm, serious, and funny at the same time. The group makes a living from its music, and available venues are diverse and range from very formal theater concerts to more popular concerts in open-air theaters or parks. In formal theater concerts they play to packed houses-often the late comers must buy their tickets from scalpers. The interaction between the musicians and their public is direct, immediate and feverish. Los Kjarkas bring the house down. How do Los Kjarkas set the communicative process in motion? What kinds of messages are being passed and how? The whole performance is an emergent process in which a dialectic is created from the dialogue and the live sound that both reassures and fulfills the listeners' expectations, but also surprises them. Their general public is very "popular," meaning it is made up of elements consisting of working- class, cholitas, university students, and otherwise very few upper-class</page><page sequence="31">82 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas people. Los Kjarkas make themselves very accessible and are generous with the public. I saw one instance at an open air theater when they en- couraged a "Kjarkas sing-alike" contest on the spot (it may have been sponsored by a soft drink company), where young men had a real chance and privilege at singing with the big stars. The singing was its own reward: Los Kjarkas accompanied the winner in the song of his choice. To introduce the pieces Gonzalo establishes a connection with the audience by talking, joking, and making the audience feel at home. Each introduction is concurrently a construction in stages through several images and rhetorical devices, projecting on the feelings the audience is about to have. Some examples are discussed below. The excerpt below on the name "Los Kjarkas" is part of a much larger talk, and I am transcribing only part of it: Quiza muchos de Uds se pregunten sobre el significado de la palabra Kjarkas. Es una palabra que se perdi6 con el tiempo y que aparece en la America Latina. . . significa la fortaleza, el valor, el coraje, la temeridad de un pueblo. De ahf que las "machu kjarjas" durante el incario eran las fortalezas que eran para atajar la invasi6n de las tribus selvicolas del americano. Y habian muchas fortalezas, fortines, donde el hombre se agrandaba. (Recorded inter- view, Berkeley, 1986) Maybe many of you want to know about the meaning of the word Kjarkas. It's a word that got lost with time and appears in Latin America . . . [it] means the strength, the valor, the courage, the temerity of a people. Thence, the "machu Kjarkas" that served to forestall the invasions from the low-land tribes of America. And there were many fortresses, forts, where man made himself greater. The appeal here is to antiquity, Amerindian roots, and as previously men- tioned, an indigenous bastion of strength and resistance through which "man made himself greater," that is, by resisting the outsider. On the Zampofia: Hay muchas canciones en el repertorio de Los Kjarkas que hace mucho tiempo no tocabamos. Son canciones que empezamos mas o menos hace catorce o quince aios atras y con unos instrumentos bastante interesantes y milenarios, ya que la zampona que tenemos en Bolivia, tengo la suerte de tener una zampoiia que el carbono 14, una zamponia de arcilla de barro cocida, da mas o menos diez mil afos de antiguedad. Hace diez mil afos los hombres en Latinoamerica tocaban instrumentos de viento y eran cosas bastante perfectas. Una vez con mi hermano Ulises Hermosa fufmos con un diapas6n electr6nico y tocamos uno de esos tubos de arcilla y daba un mi, 44 justo, iimaginese Uds! Que recursos, que tecnicas empleaban pero real- mente eran cosas perfectas. Y asi muchos instrumentos de arcilla, entre ellos algunas ocarinas, un mont6n de cosas, instrumentos que si ha podido per-</page><page sequence="32">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 83 durar el tiempo, porque la zampoiia de toqoru que es un material que es una planta, una cania, no puede perdurar ni siquiera, pienso a la intemperie ni siquiera mil afnos. Pero tengo la suerte de que nuestros antepasados si, pudieron hacer las zampofias de arcilla y eso nos di6 la pauta de que nuestra zampofia era tan antigua como el hombre en la America, imaginense. Y eso es un testimonio. No podemos decir los americanos que tiempo llevamos en la America ya que nuestros antropologos, geologos se ocupan de todas esas cosas. Pero es hermoso, es hermoso tener estos instrumentos ya que para mi realmente forman el grito mismo de la madre tierra, el grito de la Pachamama al juntarse con el viento que es la caricia de la paja brava. Hoy queremos traerles el pueblito mas rec6ndito de Bolivia, un pueblo alejado, pueblo antiquisimo que viene con estos versos que dice Chullpara, en ritmo trote. (Recorded interview, Berkeley 1986) There are many songs in Los Kjarkas' repertory that we hadn't played in a long time. There are songs we started about fourteen or fifteen years ago, and with a very interesting and millenary instrument, the zampofia we have in Bolivia. Ten thousand years ago the men in Latin America played wind instruments and they were very perfect things. Once with my brother Ulises Hermosa we went with an electronic tuning fork and we played one of those clay tubes, and it gave an E 44 just. Imagine! What resources, what techniques they must have employed, but really they were perfect things. Like this, many clay instruments, among them some ocarinas, many things, instruments that have lasted through time, because the toqoru zampofia, that is a plant material, a reed, cannot last out in the open, I think not even a thousand years. But we are lucky that our ancestors, yes, they could make their clay zampofias and that is how we know that our zampona is as old as man in the Americas, imagine. And that is a testimony, we cannot say how long we Americans have inhabited America. Our anthropologists, our geolo- gists deal with that. But it is beautiful, it is beautiful to have these instru- ments, that for us mean the call of the mother earth, the cry of the Pachamama when she joins with the wind which is the caress of the paja brava. Today we want to bring to you the most hidden little village in Bolivia, a far away village, one of the oldest that comes with these verses, in trote rhythm. This speech has the purpose of situating the panpipe, the zampona, not only historically but proto-historically as the musical instrument of the continent in order to exonerate it from the connotation "illiterate," "uncivilized," and the racist "Indian" assigned to it by the dominant classes for ages. For this reason, the appeal to the legitimizing, irrefutable, scientific facts are devices that place science, the sacred cow of the West, on the side of the zampona. Who can argue with Carbon 14, and with electronic tuning forks? In this way the zampofia, metaphoricized as the cry of the earth, the caress of the paja brava, the one in which the most hidden and old villages find their voice, is revindicated.</page><page sequence="33">84 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas From Saya to Lambada The importation of Africans as slaves was more the rule than the exception throughout the colony in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It was no different in High Peru (Alto Peru), now Bolivia, the source of the richest silver mines centered in Potosi that supplied the Spanish empire. The African presence in Bolivia was very important in this particular period of colonial history in respect to the economic exigencies of the empire which required a redoubled added manpower to do the heavy work of the mines and the furnaces of the "Casa de la Moneda," the minting center. The number of slaves brought to this part of the continent never matched the quantities brought to other places of South America. Nevertheless, the number of imported Africans to this region is not negligible, as we may infer from the registers of the documents of the times (Portugal Ortiz 1977). Because Africans could not resist the inhospitable conditions and tempera- tures of the highlands, they were taken to the more temperate regions of the Yungas7 to work in the coca, cane, and sugar plantations (Pizarroso Cuenca 1977). This practice lasted well into the nineteenth century. Throughout the colonial period all kinds of laws were formulated that regulated the social interactions between blacks and Spaniards, but also between blacks and Indians. By the first years of independence in the nineteenth century, the African presence had dwindled down for a number of reasons, having concentrated mostly in two cantones (sub-provinces): Pacallo and Mururata in the Yungas region. The existing documentation drawn from the tributary registers indicates that around 1883 the African population, referred to as moreno in these censuses, reached no more than 10 percent to 15 percent in the more concentrated areas. Today, the African presence in Bolivia is negligible, the reduced pockets of black people existing in the same isolated communities in the subtropical valleys of La Paz for all practical purposes have become assimilated to the indigenous population of those regions. There are no homogeneous cul- tural practices that may have left their enduring imprint to the extent they have in other parts of South America and the Caribbean. (So exceptionally rare is the presence of the African other than in the Yungas, that in the folklore of urban schoolchildren there is the practice of pinching one another for good luck whenever a black sighting occurs.) Yet, for its conspicuous absence in the general fabric of Bolivian society, it is remarkable that the African presence is instead conspicuously present in the folk dances of the Aymara. The most prestigious and widespread dance at fiestas and festivals is the renowned Morenos dance, a masked dance that features the representation of black dancers, the masks empha- sizing and exaggerating the facial features of the African, protruding eyes, thick lips, black skin. There are hierarchies in this dance: the Reyes Morenos</page><page sequence="34">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 85 (the kings), the Caporales (overseers) and the Morenos. The dancers wear a tin helmet resembling a miner's, topped by three long colored plumes worn over a horsehair wig. The dress is unwieldly cumbersome, richly em- broidered and in the shape of a cylindrical skirt complemented by towering epaulettes or, in the case of a rey, a cape. The dancers carry matracas, ratchets to accompany the music and mark the pace. Costumed young girls precede the dancers,8 whereas the women follow the men as a block wearing their traditional festive garb of pollera and manta. Morenadas are danced to a band accompaniment and the musical form has a distinctive melodic formula. It is a slow dance with heavy steps, its own distinctive rhythm and musical conventions. Although this dance has not been studied in depth, it has been speculated that it represents the rebellion of the slaves against the foreman, the capataz, whom they inebriate and then force to perform the heavy duties of stomping the grapes and turning the heavy press (Urquizo Sossa 1977). This would explain the sound of the ratchets, the cogs iconically symbolize those of the wine presses; the cylindrical skirts of the dancers represent the wine casks. Morenada is the dance that has more prestige than others and is the most prominent in the city festivals. It is also much preferred when- ever young urban Aymaras return to their community fiestas. Seeing that at the heart and core of Andean peoples dancing is such a primary mode of expression, what is the connection? Why should an ethnic group take on the symbols of another and represent this absence in the most symbolic, visible, and insistent way? It has been speculated by Bolivian investigators, that the presence of Blacks in Indian folklore signals the "othering" of Aymara in front of a group that was even more enslaved, more dominated and more subjugated than they were. And that this has remained in the collective unconsciousness of an ethnic group that, al- though numerically superior, has remained in a position of subjugation. The other dance is Caporales who dance to the rhythm of saya, a genre that originates in the Yungas and it is one of the rare African-derived musics existent in Bolivia. Originally it accompanied the dance of the Tundiqui, onomatopoeic of the sound 'tun-diki" made by the instrument, a single headed hand-held drum. Spoken texts were fitted to match the rhythm. These texts, "coplas," are improvised but are also drawn from an already existing corpus. The Tundiquis were the original dancers who came from the Yungas to dance in the city on occasion. The dress is very simple and it reflects the everyday wear of the people of this region. The women wear full skirts and a manta (shawl), the men a loose shirt and tight knee- length pants. Out of the Tundiquis developed the related dance Los Negritos, danced in the city by groups of young men who in imitation of Tundiquis paint their faces black and wear curly-haired wigs. Los Negritos take a cue in their garb from the Afro-Cuban images of the 1940s and 1950s and don the</page><page sequence="35">86 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas characteristic ruffled, swollen sleeves in bright colors. They dance to the rhythm of the saya, played on drums, and sing the texts of the coplas. The general context for this dance is during patronalfiestas, and when city groups visit the provincial towns at the time of the yearlyfiesta. On these occasions, in the melee of musics coming together from various sources, there is a cross-pollination that results in the adoption of new melodies to which texts are added. Thus we have both, spoken texts, but also sung texts. The new lyrics are set to already existing melodies and cast in saya rhythm. I have collected an example in which a group of Negritos dancers had adopted a sikuri (panpipe) piece at a fiesta in which Sikuris participated and had instantly recast the same material into a different genre. The Caporales dance is an offshoot of these others and takes its cue in the character of the caporal, who as a character appears sporadically both in the Tundiqui and in the Negritos dance. The caporal, an overseer in times of the slave trade, was a mediating figure whose task was to choose the new arrivals and assign their tasks and labors as well as supervise them. The caporal oversaw the labor in large haciendas and reached the large expanses of land on horseback. Appropriately, his work dress included riding pants, boots, and a large straw hat, the brim turned up, as well as a ldtigo (whip) across his chest. The dance repeats these features of dress. The music to the Caporales is the saya, which in the last few years has undergone a few changes and acquired great popularity, particularly with the growth and expansion of the big urban festivals such as the Oruro Carnaval, the Entrada del Gran Poder (La Paz), the Virgen de Urkupifia (Cochabamba). Caporales has been adopted by many young people and become an urban dance most favored by high school and university students. In fact, within the last five years, university students in the city of La Paz have imple- mented their own "entrada,"9 each of the facultades (colleges) presenting one or two dances of several hundred dancers. This "entrada" is modelled after the traditional "entradas," featuring the same kind of format, but divested of the religious-ritual aspects surrounding them. An informal inquiry as to the preference for this dance draws enthusiastic comments ranging from its aesthetic qualities: "el baile es lindo"; 'los pasos son bonitos"; "el ritmo es lo que mas gusta"; to the more intangible, "te sale de adentro"; and the social, "yo bailo porque todos mis amigos bailan alla." The young people feel that the dance looks good, has nice steps and a catchy rhythm, and "comes from within." Moreover, it provides an oppor- tunity to be together and make friends. During the performance another aspect becomes evident: the dance provides an arena where both sexes can show off, the men as men, and the women as women. Caporales privileges the male dancers since in it they have the opportunity to "strut their stuff" by performing a variety of newly invented and expanded dance steps, some nearing acrobatics. The costumes of full riding pants, boots attached with</page><page sequence="36">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 87 bells, and a big straw hat adorned with flowing ribbons, turned up in the style of the royal caporales, have added more recently features that suggest the fantastic images taken from television and recall episodes from the popular program "Star Trek." The girls' dress, full miniskirts, does not bear any resemblance to the actual dress worn in the Yungas villages. This is big time and exhuberance. The music is provided by a brass band. The dancers no longer play the drums as was the case with Tundiqui and Negritos, but mark the rhythm blowing a whistle. The repertoire of band sayas is huge and it increases every year. The bands continuously renew their repertoire by adding the latest 'hits." For example, the huayno "Jilguero Flores" by Los Kjarkas was turned into one of the most popular band sayas; in fact, many huaynos are easily turned into sayas by slightly changing the rhythm, and adding the identifying "signature" that marks the piece as a saya. Saya is characterized by its rhythm marked by the drum: Drum I ) !

Los Kjarkas The characteristic "signature" of a saya is this pattern, or a variant thereof: or ^ 1 r ' r n or: 1 ji ry I I , I1 or: ) ^ Pr) J7~'^n i "Llorando sefue," a saya, was created by Los Kjarkas in 1981. At the struc- tural level, the piece is extremely simple, two contrasting musical phrases, interpolated by an instrumental interlude. In a minor mode, a descending line, semiclosure on the relative major; second subject on the IV and VI. What is unusual about this song are the leaps in the melody of the second phrase: descending 6ths, followed by an ascending 7th, to come back down in a descending 6th before it closes. The interlude is provided by a repeti- tive pattern in the zampona that departs from the typical saya "signatures." Yet, the creativity of "Llorando se fue" is manifest in how the rhythm is manipulated. The melody keeps an autonomy with respect to the rhythm that is not immediately identifiable as a saya. The charango introduces the piece in two beats that suggest a huayno. The voice enters with "Llorando se fue" together with the tun-tuna of the drum, marking the rhythm in a counter beat to that of the huayfio, establishing the piece as a saya, not a huayno. In my opinion, the other feature of "Llorando sefue" that makes this such an in- teresting piece of music is that it contains the atypical interval leaps. The melody, however, keeps its own line, thereby providing an alternative to whoever is following the song: in other words, it goes against the expecta- tions. This is the piece that has toured the world.

The reader will have a feeling of how the entire speech builds up as contextualizing background to the saya, but at the same time, reinforces and reaffirms the historical, territorial, and mythological elements that identifies the saya as Bolivian. It is as if different "interpretive moves" were being directed already by the discursive moves employed by Hermosa, who keys them to motivate the listener to be an active participant in the process: Culturas en America se juntaron hace tantos ainos atras.

Well, based on that well make up a small legend that I was inspired to do when I was coming back from Buenos Aires across the salt desert of Uyuni, what a beauty! Our grandfathers say that the high snow-covered mountains of Bolivia got together on the 15th of July to celebrate the vzspera [vespers], and were going to come. There was Tata [father] Sabaya, Sajama, Huayna Potosi, Illimani, Tunari, with its little snow cap, white sombrerito of a cholita, Illampu, all were there, Sorata, and all of them. They paraded, each one, Tunari brought his chi- chita, well, he drank it on the way. Tarijeiios were represented by Sama, they arrived late, but they arrived the 16th. Well, they got together in the Plaza Perez Velazco and in the night with ponches [punches] they gave their welcome, and later, two in the morning, ended up in a cantina of calle Buenos Aires for the remate [conclusion] (voices), and 6 in the morning they each went home, as they say, and they were all laying about with their beautiful white ponchos, the mute guardians of our history. But there were other mountains like the Sama and the greenish hills of the Yungas of La Paz, that went climbing steep slopes with their monkeys and their parrots their reco-recos, tambourines bringing this black saya song that says llorando se fue y me dej6 solo sin su amor." Llorando se fue Llorando se fue La recuerdo hoy y me dej6 solo sin su amor y en mi pecho no existe el rencor Sola estara Llorando estara recordando este amor recordando el amor que el tiempo no puede borrar que un dia no supo cuidar She left weeping I remember her today and left me alone loveless there is no rancour in my breast she's perhaps alone she's probably weeping remembering this love remembering this love that time cannot erase she did not look after</page><page sequence="42">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 93 In this speech, Hermosa first situates the piece historically and juxtaposes it with African music in other places of the contintent, such as Brazil. The message seems to be: this is our Afro-American music, it is African, but now it is Bolivian. In a way that is very personally his, he establishes a rapport with the public even down to the individuals by acknowledging their names, their provenance, their towns of origin. He then maps the territory. The mention of all of those places: plaza such and such, calle so and so, has the power to jolt the memory and throws ropes that people can hold onto to be brought back through these memories right into the center of the action. Thus, he is appealing to their affective responses. As he is describing the places, the public latches onto the ropes and responds, adds details, quotes, comments, laughs, reminds Gonzalo about things he for- got, celebrates the wisecracks, and Gonzalo addresses every comment, at times getting off the track. He makes jokes about the foibles of some Bolivians (such as when Chuquisaqueios let Paceiios take the capital away). These are historic-political events that every Bolivian knows about and can relate to. In the third part of his speech, he invokes the telluric, mythological, Andean part of the Bolivian heritage. No regular, everyday city places, but the mountains that surround La Paz and the indigenous cosmology are viewed and entrusted as the timeless old sages and guardians (there is a word, the Apus). These mountains, however, are personified and endowed with the attributes of the people of the regions: Tunari drank his chicha on the way, and Sama arrived late. After they have all partied out, they all retire, but end up lying around on the streets with their beautiful ponchos spread about, thus, reproducing the kinds of human behaviors typical to this context. (This would be the time when the drunks go down the street crying wayayay.) The lower mountains and the greenish hills of the valleys come to celebrate bringing their animals, monkeys and parrots, and also their musical symbol, the saya, which begins to play as Gonzalo ends his speech. Thus, the communication is accomplished. Piracy and Greed In the year 1981 Los Kjarkas registered their song among others that make up the album Canto a la Mujer de mi Pueblo with the Bolivian Ministry's Department of Culture. This registration, however, is not the same as a copyright, it simply certifies authorship of a work. Bolivia was not at the time a signatory of the international copyright agreements. Los Kjarkas recorded it in 1982 with Lauro Records, the Bolivian recording firm responsible for most of their albums. In 1983, the piece began to be covered by other artists. The Peruvian 'Cuarteto Continental" had made a tropical</page><page sequence="43">94 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas arrangement of it and recorded it. In turn, the Argentinian Juan Ram6n, the Colombian Pastor L6pez, a renowned "salsero," and the Brazilian Marcia Ferreira and Jose Ari recorded it also, the latter in Portuguese. All of the artists mentioned at least one of the Hermosa brothers as the authors of the piece." About mid 1989 this same piece, through the able marketing techniques of a French individual, was spreading round the world as a new "discovery" and retitled "Lambada." It was recorded by the popular group Kaoma and instrumentally rearranged by speeding up the tempo and changing the beat to a duple time. The mechanisms of the market and advertisement did the rest, and "Lambada," the song, became the furor of pop music for awhile. Coated over with choreographic elements that play on the other stereotype some Europeans like to have of Latin Americans, of their unbridled sex- uality, lambada was touted to be the most sensuous dance that had ap- peared in years. In fact, it is not exactly coy. Lambada is a legitimate urban Brazilian ballroom/nightclub dance by itself which has a role in Brazilian popular musical culture. It flourished in the Rio gafieiras (dancing saloons) from the 1950s onwards. In the 1980s it was heavily influenced by other black currents such as Dominican black percussion and merengue beat. It is to the Northeastern part of Brazil that the French individuals came, saw, and with dollar signs in their eyes sought to conquer. The most telling of the press items transcribed traces the details of this ill-conceived enterprise: Will America follow Europe in embracing the sexy new dance craze known as Lambada? That's what Jean Karakos, a French music entrepreneur, and his partner, Oliver Lorsac, a film maker, hope will happen through the com- bination of a television blitz and an American tour by Kaoma, a band assembled by Mr. Karakos. On Friday evening, the seven-member group, based in Paris is to perform with eight lambada dancers at the Palladium, 136 East 14th Street. In Europe the Brazilian dance, reminiscent of the tango but danced with the two partners, pelvis-to-pelvis, became a sensation last summer largely through ingenious marketing. With $300,000 Mr. Karakos and Mr. Lorsac bought the rights to 400 lambada songs, filmed a racy 10-minute documentary showing off the dance, and put together Kaoma, whose four core members are alumni of the African pop band Kunde. Kaoma recorded a single, "Lam- bada," and an album, World-Beat (Epic). With the help of 250 airings of Mr. Lorsac's video on France's major television station, TF1, "lambada" sold 1.8 million copies in France and swept Europe, selling four million [my emphasis] and is becoming the most successful European single in the history of CBS. The sound of "Lambada," which features the lead vocals of Loalwa Braz, a Brazilian singer, suggests a more mechanized echo of Santana. Kaoma is a multinational band. Its members, who range in age from 22</page><page sequence="44">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 95 to 40, come from Brazil, Senegal, Guadeloupe, Algeria, Martinique, and France, and songs on World-Beat embrace several languages. 'The band is not musically revolutionary or out to prove anything," Mr. Karakos said last week in a telephone interview. "It's just pop music with world music sources." In trying to bring Lambada fever to America, Mr. Karakos said he has encountered barriers that he did not face abroad. "America is a big challenge," he said. "I used to live here, and I know all the difficulties. The language barrier is a bigger problem in America than anywhere else. The song also has nothing to do with the formats that are already in place in American discotheques (my emphasis). It's very difficult for disk jockeys in clubs to stick one song that doesn't fit their formats right into the middle. Television will be the key. If it works, it will create a demand from the street, and well sell 10 million copies." Just pop music with world music resources would have been a more accurate description by Mr. Karakos. After the much anticipated premiere, this is what Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote about it: The pop version of Lambada, a prefabricated danced craze hoping to hap- pen, arrived in NY when Kaoma performed at the Palladium on Friday night. Kaoma-a Paris-based group that includes musicians from Brazil, Africa, the Caribbean and France-has sold four million copies of its single Lambada since its release in Europe last summer. The song is an international hybrid a digital-era French production of an eminently catchy Bolivian melody featuring the sound of a button accordion, lyrics in Portuguese, and a version of the Lambada rhythm that originated in Northeastern Brazil. Kaoma was assembled by its producers to perform the song and it's a thoroughly professional group that puts the rhythm section of the Senegalese- Parisian band Toure Kunda behind a sultry-voiced Brazilian singer Loalwa Braz. Yet whether or not the Lambada catches on here, Kaoma has the makings of a one-hit wonder. To fill out a slick, cheerful set that lasted barely longer than an hour, it played "Lambada"and "Lambada Caribe" twice. Yet, for anyone who has heard some of the multiplying varieties of modern African Caribbean and Brazilian dance music, Kaoma sounds like the house band at some of the better tourist trap hotels, singing in Portuguese, Spanish, French and English. In Kaoma's hands, the lambada rhythm, nothing special,-a four-square- clipetty clop beat-sounds like a slowed down merengue played by a polka band. Along with the music, Kaoma features eight dancers-bare chested men and short skirted women who demonstrate the Lambada. It's a lithe lascivious close clenched couple dance in which the woman's pelvis grinds against the man's thigh, thrust between her legs, as the couple glides and turns and dips, some songs ended with the woman bent so far back her head nearly touched the stage. If the public follows suit, chiropractors could have their greatest bonanza since the twist.</page><page sequence="45">96 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui. Los Kjarkas As a pop novelty act, Kaoma is fun, it would be more enjoyable if it weren't trying so hard to exploit the growing interest in Third World rock. Its album title is World-Beat, and its set included a half hearted drumming and chanting selection, similar to what many world beat bands play as a tribute to their roots. The zouk music of the Antillian-Parisian band Kassav (Kaoma's obvious model for staging) the mbalza of Senegal's Youssou NDour and the Soukous of Kanda Bongo Man all carry forward traditional elements, the connection to a specific culture and place is a major part of their appeal. But Kaoma's music comes from a different heritage-one in which Western cultures borrow, dilute, commercialize other people's traditions. On stage, Lambada itself told the story. The first time through (but not the second) one of the singers flaunted an accordion, a symbol of homegrown music. But the accordion line was actually being played on the synthesizer by the band's producer, Jean Claude Bonaventure. The accordion, like most of Kaoma's other claims to roots, was faked. There are many other general commentaries in the press that generally locate the piece in Brazil, focusing on its overt sensuality. But the article that sums up this lurid affair is the one that Alan Riding of the New York Times wrote not six months after his initial commentary: One year after the lively song Lambada and the sensual dance of the same name arrived from Brazil and took first France and then Europe by storm, France's society of composers has ruled that the song is in fact Bolivian. The Society of Musical Authors, Composers and Editors, said it had ac- cepted a complaint by two Bolivian brothers, Gonzalo and Ulises Hermosa, that their song, "Llorando se fue" or "He left Crying" [actually she] was the melody used for Lambada. In January the office, better known by its French acronym, SACEM, ordered the royalties from the record sales of "Lambada" to be frozen. Jean Loup Tourier, the society's director general, said that a French entrepreneur, Olivier Lamotte d'ncamps had been reprimanded for claiming to have written the song. 'This is an extremely rare measure that has not been adopted by SACEM in 30 years," he added. Lambada, recorded by a group called Kaoma, and the dance became popular in many countries, but nowhere more than in France where they were introduced with a blitz of publicity and marketing tricks during a Paris music festival in June 1989. Five million single records and two million albums with the song were reportedly sold worldwide. Mr. Lamotte dlncamps, who also uses the name Olivier Lorsac, said he discovered "Lambada" in the Brazilian resort of Porto Seguro in 1988. When its copyright was registered at SACEM, the song's composer was listed as Chico de Oliveira, although this was subsequently found to be a pseudonym for Mr. Lamotte dIncamps. His copyright to the song has been cancelled. Within weeks, the Hermosa brothers said "Llorando se fue" had been pla- giarized. On the American release of Kaoma's album, the liner notes said of the</page><page sequence="46">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 97 song: "Ulises and Gonzalo Hermosa and Olivier Lorsac contributed to its realization, although the song was still credited exclusively to Chico de Oliveira. In October, French press reports said, Mr. Lamotte dincamps and his partnerJean Georgekarakos, offered the Bolivians US. $140,000 !!! for rights to the song but were turned down, reportedly on the ground that the amount fell far short of worldwide earnings from the record. The French press has reported an out-of-court agreement giving 25 percent royalties on the record to Mr. Lamotte dIncamps' company and editor and promoter, 25 percent to CBS records as distributors, and 50 percent to EMI, which owns the rights to "Llorando se fue." Perhaps something is being lost in the translation here: If dlncamps got 25 percent, CBS another 25 percent, and EMI 50 percent, what did Los Kjarkas get? Conclusion The assumption behind the music of Los Kjarkas is that Bolivia as a nation is plagued by the alienating influences from the outside. For this reason Los Kjarkas believe that the power of music as a cultural symbol, raised as a banner of liberation can bring self-discovery, self acceptance and self- respect in the people. In this article I have attempted to show how the diverse images of Bolivia, a complex of multiple ethnicities and identities, are embedded and articulated in and through the music of Los Kjarkas. These multiple ethnicities and identities surface, mixed and matched, in a weft of sound-iconicities and symbols that resonate in the receptivity of the many publics of Los Kjarkas. I have also indicated the complexity involved in tracing the musical biographies of the genres that make up Bolivian musica folkldrica, in this case, the history of the saya. It has been shown that a musical genre, by the time it becomes a massive popular culture item has passed through several filters of interpretations and reinterpretations layered upon each other. "Chorando se foi," the Lambada version of "Llorando se fu6" is a cumula- tion of this layering that at each stage, from Afro-Bolivian community, to village festivities, to city bandas, to musica folklorica, in turn, added, sub- tracted, or multiplied, modifying its musical and extra-musical components before it ever left Bolivia. In the image of the torrid dance that was the intended purpose for its mercantilization, there is not the remotest clue to any of the cultural, social, and historical values behind it. The appropria- tion, commodification, and outright exploitation of a cultural expression is nothing new. In this case, it is outrageous that the name of Mr. Chico de Oliveira, a.k.a. Lamotte dIncamps, should have appeared, cynically,</page><page sequence="47">98 : Huayno, Saya, and Chuntunqui: Los Kjarkas as the author of the song, dismissing it as afaux-pas once the perpetrators were discovered. This process opens up a whole new area of issues to be discussed, for which there already exists a vast literature. This task will have to be addressed at a future time. (However, it is interesting to note that on account of the Lambada episode, an enthusiastic new audience for Los Kjarkas was generated, this time coming from the Bolivian upper classes whose preference in music generally draws its members away from mzusica folklorica.) That Los Kjarkas truly do represent their people is voiced in the opinion of composer and Canto Nuevo musician Luis Rico, an active participant in the life of musicafolkl6rica since the inception of Peia Naira: Los Kjarkas han sabido mostrar su propio pueblo, c6mo es su pueblo. Es un pueblo que come bien, se divierte, atraves de la chicha y el alcohol vierte sus sentimientos, bien unidos a la naturaleza, bien unidos a la mujer cocha- bambina, bien unidos al amor de la pareja del valle, que es el amor mas fresco, mas sincero a veces mas inestable, entonces Los Kjarkas han expre- sado eso, y ese es su gran valor.12 Los Kjarkas have been able to show what their people are like. They are a people who eat well, have fun, pour their sentiments in chicha and alcohol, very linked to nature, very linked to the woman of Cochabamba, very linked to the love of the valley couples, which is a fresh love, a sincere love, often an unstable love; Los Kjarkas have expressed all of that, and that is their great merit. I am still curious, though, to know if "Llorando se fue" has something intrinsically of its own, something, perhaps structural, perhaps semantic, that has made it so appealing from the outset. (Of all the Lambadas launched, "Llorando se fue" is the musical piece associated with the genre.) I do not think I have an answer as yet. In the meantime, sayas will continue to be composed and danced happily. Notes *A la memoria de Ulises Hermosa, "Kjarka" poeta y cantor decedido en Houston el 5 de Abril de 1992. 1. The Ministerio de Educacion from term to term has been renamed Ministerio de Educacion y Cultura, and in some administrations Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Turismo. Not coincidentally, some functions of culture are blurred with or contained in tourism. 2. We should not forget that in the 1940s the populist government of</page><page sequence="48">Gilka Wara Cespedes : 99 President Gualberto Villarroel had preconized the emancipation of the Indians. The first Congreso Indigenal was held in La Paz in 1945. It also conglomerated participants from the altiplano who came to show their traditional dances and music at the soccer stadium. Today many oldsters still remember that occasion. 3. It is interesting to note that in recent years (1980s), the indigenous communities themselves sponsor these festivals for in-house (in- community) use, particularly since the inception of the Katarista parties. I see this as counter-hegemonic and as an affirmation of their own strength and identity. 4. The replacement for Ulises Hermosa is Rolando Malpartida. 5. For an interesting reading on the interface of the ethnic, national, political and cultural discourses, please see a recent article by Thomas Abercrombie (Abercrombie 1991: pp. 95 ff.). 6. Remedios is a "Cholita" who sits in parliament as a congresswoman. She has not abandoned her traditional dress nor made any conces- sions to the trappings of the post. She champions the causes of the women of her class and status, and has introduced bills to secure some benefits to the large segment of women who work as domestics in the upper-class households. 7. The Yungas is the semitropical region on the slopes east of the Cor- dillera mountains. The altitude is between 800 to 2,000 meters. The humid and warm climate allows the cultivation of coffee, coca, tobacco and many fruits, particularly citrus and many varieties of bananas. The Yungas is where coca grows best, and on this account, a region targeted by the "clean-up" policies of the United States under Republican administrations. 8. The dress of the young girls features high thigh boots and very short miniskirts. This development reflects a concession to city tastes. This was not always so, these figures originally were danced by trans- vestite men because they represented lewdness and lechery attributed to the female component of this dance, a certain Maria Antonieta who supposedly was the lover of the Capataz, and ridiculed in the dance (Paredes de Salazar: 98). 9. Entradas are the massive entrances of dancers at regular patronal fiestas. 10. Gonzalo Hermosa believes that the saya is the black version of the huayno. He thinks that saya is how blacks see and interpret the huayno, imbuing it with their personality and style. (This may be a reason why "Llorando se fue" starts off as a huayno). 11.
