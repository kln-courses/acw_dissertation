(Acc. 7-IX-1985) "Fear of the dangers of anthropomorphism has caused ethologists to neglect many interesting phenomena, and it has become apparent that they could afford a little disciplined indulgence." Robert A. HINDE (1982) Introduction "The teleological implications of 'purpose' ... were formerly anathema to purists, but since it has been recognized that even machines can be regarded as teleological mechanisms (e.g., ROSENBLUETH, WIENER &amp; BIGELOW, 1943) teleology is no longer disreputable. With the swing of the scientific pendulum, there has been a growing feeling against oversimple explanations of the behavior of even lower organisms and a tendency once again to use concepts of 'goal-direction' or 'purpose' in describing it" (HINDE &amp; STEVENSON, 1970). Some ethologists and comparative psychologists reject explanation of animal behavior in cognitive terms. Nevertheless, they use such terms in description of animal behavior. What does it take? How can one describe behavior cognitively and at the same time objectively? The word "cognition" is defined as: 1. The act or faculty of knowing or perceiving. 2. A thing known; a conception or perception. It is cognition as an "act" concerned with environmental "things" that is of concern. At what point in describing behavior does "description" begin to border on "explanation"? Under what circumstances does it become necessary to refer to behavior in cognitive terms? When does an "act" constitute knowledge of an environmental "thing"? 1) A paper presented at: The First International Symposium on Stickleback Behaviour: 1934-1984; 50 years of stickleback ethology. Leiden, 4-7 September 1984, The Netherlands. (On the occasion of the retirement of Professor J. J. A. van IERSEL). Unfor- tunately the manuscript reached the editors too late for including the paper in the Stickleback Volume (Behaviour 93).</page><page sequence="2">2 EVERETT J. WYERS To "know" something implies representation (preservation of the ef- fects) of past and current events (if not something more). Wherever an "act" differentiates behaviors differing widely in complexity, while em- phasis remains on the organismic-environmental interface, and "something more" is implied, the existence of "knowledge" (cognition) is denoted. Is there reason to seek indications denoting cognitive processing of behavior (knowledge) in sticklebacks? What sorts of criteria would denote its existence? Six are offered here. 1. Decision hierarchy. "Much complex behaviour in fact involves a succession of goals, which may be hierarchically organized with respect to each other" (HINDE, 1982; p. 76). The behavior of three-spined sticklebacks is a typical exam- ple (see DAWKINS, 1976). The behavior of sticklebacks is viewed as a hierarchically organized set of strategic moves oriented to individual reproductive success as the final goal. Even so, the tactics of individual fish in implementing the strategies can vary widely (WOOTTON, 1984; GILES, 1984). This point of view (see WOOTTON, 1984) recognizes constraints while recognizing other forms of individual variation. Cognitive-behavior is one. 2. Self initiation and goal orientation. Cognitive-behavior implies some degree of "self-initiation" as well as "goal-orientation". Internal representation of past and current events control ongoing behavior. Behavior "stops" when current circumstances correspond to "goal-orientation". Accordingly description of behavior as cognitive must focus on "initiating" and "stopping" circumstances, but need not rest there. Behavior "stops" when it changes, but "change" is in the human "eye". The essence of cognitive-behavior rests in the in- tervening events differentiating "initiation" and "stopping". 3. Means activities and least effort. Intervening events are characterized at a "molar" and "purposive" level (TOLMAN, 1932). It is what the stickleback does as a whole, as a part of the circumstances it is embedded in, that counts. This in the light of circumstances currently, recently, or long-since experienced. What it does in moving from nest to "goal" varies depending not only on the "goal" (e.g., predator, prey, female, male, or offspring), but on</page><page sequence="3">COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR AND STICKLEBACKS 3 the distances, objects, and obstacles, that must be dealt with in transit. "Means-activities" differ both in terms of "goals" and "circumstances", and in terms of past experience. "Means-activities" also tend to relative efficiency (reduced effort) in getting to a "goal". Sticklebacks do "short-cut" when possible, unless earlier experience interferes (taken broadly, as in JENNI'S, 1969, 1972, work on "shyness" and "taming", and more specifically as in SEVENSTER'S, 1968, 1973, reports). 4. Temporal frame. When behavior dependent on earlier experience: "can run with zero delay between 'input' and 'output' .... the output cannot be under the direct control of the inputs-it must be controlled by some sort of runn- ing prediction of what the inputs (or rather the relevant external events) are likely to be in the near future" (GREGORY, 1975, p. 612). LASHLEY (1951) was first to apply this sort of reasoning to the organization of serial movement patterns. In stickleback behavior the capture of fastmoving prey "objects" under standardized conditions (e.g., see MILINSKI, 1984; and earlier papers by MILINSKI and his colleagues) as a function of ex- perience could perhaps, provide a case in point. Extrapolation of future events under nonstandardized circumstances is another case in point. Unlike the "zero-delay" case prediction is based only on current events (KRUSHINSKII, 1962). Stickleback response to hat- chlings rising to the surface for their first gulp of air involves such predic- tions. "Many attempts to get to the surface are counteracted by the father who is continuously active in trying to retrieve the young both on their upward journey and when they are coming down" (FEUTH-DE BRUIJN &amp; SEVENSTER, 1983, p. 187; italics ours). So also, capturing prey: "Motion picture analysis revealed that three-spined sticklebacks almost never miss a pursued Daphnia" (MILINSKI &amp; LOWENSTEIN, 1980, p. 335). Again, BAKKER &amp; SEVENSTER'S (1983) description of "circle fighting" ("spine- fighting", VAN IERSEL, 1953; "roundabout fighting", WOOTTON, 1976): "The two fishes seem to chase one another, each going for the other's tail. The fast circling which ensues may continue for many minutes without interruption, there being obviously an extremely stable and delicate mutual adjustment of the fishes movements" (p. 56). 5. Sensory frame. Another form of predictive "means-end" behavior (TOLMAN, 1932, 1948) takes into account non-sensed features of the current situation. The</page><page sequence="4">4 EVERETT J. WYERS male three-spined stickleback moves in characteristic fashion after the courted female has disappeared, or after creeping-through in the absence of a female ("searching for females"; SEVENSTER, 1961; p. 11). Also, ob- jects are grasped appropriately even though the substrate beneath the grasped object cannot be seen (GREGORY, 1975). "Means-end" activity takes into account (is adjusted to) features of the situation which at the mo- ment are not evident to the senses. 6. Novelty and integration. In addition, "means-end" activity can exhibit novelty and variety. A variety of variables are taken into account in the foraging behavior of three-spined sticklebacks. The posture of nearby fish in a feeding cluster affects where an individual stickleback will forage; i.e., the head-down posture of a neighbor is attractive (SYMONS, 1971; noted in WOOTTON, 1976). The rate of individual prey consumption in different loci also in- fluences where a stickleback will forage (MILINSKI, 1984). Sticklebacks behave differently in relation to the presence of strays from a cluster of prey (HELLER &amp; MILINSKI, 1979) and in relation to the composition (OHGUCHI, 1978) and density (BEUKEMA, 1968) of a prey cluster. Cognitive theory The criteria are reasonably direct and blend to form a continuum of in- creasing need to describe behavior cognitively. Should description give way to interpretation? Optimality, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), control theory, and time-sharing models, assume complex information integrating systems in their animals. All necessary information is available to the animal. However, the burden of decision rests within, rather than in the organism-environmental interface. In effect, "cognitive" processing is assumed, although explanatory concepts are usually limited to resultant excitatory and inhibitory interrelationships (e.g., VAN IERSEL, 1953; SEVENSTER, 1961; NELSON, 1965; MCFARLAND, 1974; PEEKE, 1982, 1983). Cognitive theory does not assume "all necessary information to be available to an animal". It tries to take into account "circumstances in which the individual animal must in some way go beyond the informa- tion given at any particular moment, and not only pick up the informa- tion that falls on its receptors, but also seek it out, integrate it, store it, and retrieve it" (MENZEL &amp; WYERS, 1981, p. 370). The issue is relative;</page><page sequence="5">COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR AND STICKLEBACKS 5 but conceptually important because it concerns the kind of "calculating machine" we assume the animal to be. Discussion The cognitive approach describes behavior at a molar level; e.g., the stickleback is building a nest-even though it is at the moment not so engaged. Behavior is interpreted through such concepts as, "purpose", "goal-orientation", " cognitive-map", "means-end activity", "working-memory", "anticipation", and so on; e.g., the fish is building because it "expects" to court females. So long as "expectation" is an- chored in circumstances the fish is not now immersed in, both explana- tion and prediction of behavior is possible (HONIG, 1978). In many instances animal behavior resists explanation in terms of the "laws" of chance or the demands of Newtonian forms of necessity. To fully describe and explain such behavior requires manipulating it to em- phasize its cognitive features. To that end several phenomena seen in stickleback behavior are briefly considered. Model responsiveness. Significant numbers of male sticklebacks do not respond to models (e.g., ROWLAND, 1982; PEEKE, WYERS &amp; HERZ, 1969). Some do eventually begin to respond, but the behavior of non-responders remains to be studied. What happens? Some reports (e.g., PRESSLEY, 1981) indicate positive evasive action is taken. Vegetation is taken advantage of. The fish, in effect, "hides". The model would not be able to see the fish, if in fact, the model was a real fish. Foraging patterns. A stickleback changes its search mode after consuming a prey (THOMAS, 1974, 1977). It swims directly away, again altering its search mode, after rejecting a captured, or capturable, prey. Is something else involved? The events are complex. Short-term positive and negative after-effects occur in both cases (THOMAS, 1977). A "search-image" (TINBERGEN, 1960) appears only after rejections of a novel prey type (BEUKEMA, 1968). Concomitantly that prey is discovered at greater distances (p. 90). Does this mean "perceptual learning", response to "novelty", and conse- quent 'habituation" thereto is involved? "Growing experience with the maze-like searching area increased ... searching efficiency ... by reducing visits to parts of the searching area</page><page sequence="6">6 EVERETTJ. WYERS just scanned" (BEUKEMA, 1968, pp. 109-110). Is there a relation here to the concept of "working memory"? (OLTON, 1979). Courtship effects. A stickleback interrupts its courtship to make a nest visit. Often, with a female already following, "pricking", or "biting", intervenes (WILZ, 1970a, 1970b). Is recent inspection of "the condition" of the nest a re- quisite part of a successful courtship? Neither MCFARLAND'S "time- sharing" (McFARLAND, 1974; COHEN &amp; MCFARLAND, 1979) nor WILz's "motivational-shift" (WILZ, 1970a, b, c) results are definitive. Given appropriate vegetation does the pricking male "hide" the female in it? Is another male's "territory" nearby? WILZ (1970c) reported 24% of female approaches involved pricking. What of the other 76% ? Does the absence of a female since the last nest visit influence the likelihood of pricking? If after pricking a male is delayed, will it continue to the nest? Egg stealing is a threat. Does a neighbors presence have an influence? Does past experience with a "sneaker" have an effect? (see VAN DEN ASSEM, 1967, and WOOTTON, 1971, 1976, for analysis of "sneaker" behavior during courtship and after eggs are in the nest). Do nest visit activities correlate with the characteristics of "courted" females? If "displacement" fanning serves as a signal to "stimulate females to begin a courtship sequence" (ROHWER, 1978; p. 436), does that activity relate to the presence/absence of a female; pricked, or not? Answering such questions will clarify the range of theoretical concepts and problems applicable to the phenomena. Spatial utilization. Will a stickleback use a "short-cut" enroute to a female? In foraging for food in a constant environment the shorter (more efficient) path is prefer- red by sticklebacks (BEUKEMA, 1968). When a predator appears does the stickleback male make use of "cover" in attacking? Some males attacked a sculpin dummy even when their nest was empty, and, "actively avoided the head and were able to attack the dummy from behind" (PRESSLEY, 1981, p. 285, p. 291, p. 293). The mean distance kept and the time spent in cover in response to a live pike decreased as boldness and aggressive behavior increased (HUNTINGFORD, 1976). Physical displacement in nature indicates three-spined sticklebacks may exhibit site fidelity (HAGEN, 1967; noted in BELL, 1982) and can</page><page sequence="7">COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR AND STICKLEBACKS 7 return to the site of the nest from a distance of nearly a kilometer (KYNARD, 1978; also noted in BELL, 1882). It this the limit? If objects are placed so as to permit only a circuitous return to the nest, once the water level in a tank is appropriately lowered, will the stickleback be able to effi- ciently return to its nest? (see ARONSON, 1951). Aggression habituation. Habituation of aggression (VAN DEN ASSEM &amp; VAN DER MOLEN, 1969) leads to stimulus-specificity of response to individuals. Dominance relations between neighboring sticklebacks has also been noted (e.g., BAKKER &amp; SEVENSTER, 1983). Is individual identification of conspecifics involved? PEEKE'S recent papers (e.g., 1982, 1983) indicate both short-term and long-term decremental and incremental effects are present. "A stickleback must aggress against several neighbors simultaneously while establishing and maintaining a territory and will have to maintain these borders against the several neighbors to which it must lower its ag- gressive readiness ... while maintaining normal aggressivity for wander- ing conspecifics capable of raiding its territory for resources" (PEEKE, 1982, p. 821). When one considers the additional complexities involved in rapidly changing responsiveness to neighbors at the time of sneaker at- tacks during courtship, or when a newcomer settles in between resident males, or during egg-stealing efforts (not to mention the general melee of group nest-raiding) the need for cognitive-behavioral concepts is em- phasized. Even for sticklebacks the meaningfulness of behaviorally defin- ed relationships and sequences is heavily context dependent (see SMITH, 1965, 1968; and BEER, 1975). Conclusion When the whole range of stickleback behavior is considered cognitive concepts appear useful. Description at an adequate level of complexity (BRUNSWIK, 1956), involving context embedded meaning in a teleonomic sense (WILLIAMS, 1966), is called for. The stickleback seems, at the least, to fill in some informational gaps for itself and to go beyond the informa- tion made available by stimuli immediately at hand. References ARONSON, L. R. (1951).
