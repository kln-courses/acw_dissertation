<plain_text><page sequence="1">Victims, Allies, Rebels: Towards a New History of Nineteenth-Century Indianism in Brazil DAVID H. TREECE Introduction A fresh perspective on Brazilian Indianist literature of the nineteenth century is long overdue. Whereas our understanding of, say, Machado de Assis, Lima Barreto, and several of the Modernist writers has been enriched and, in some cases, radically readjusted in recent years by political, structuralist and other readings, we know little more of the Indianist movement than we did twenty years ago. This is all the more regrettable when one considers that the classic Indianist works are regularly to be found on the teaching lists of university courses in Brazilian literature, and that the movement is justly regarded as one of the most vigorous expressions of cultural nationalism in the country's history.1 1 The first attempt at an extensive survey of Romantic Indianism is David Miller Driver's The Indian in Brazilian Literature (New York, 1942), which provides little more than a résumé of each work considered, but is useful in drawing attention to some of the lesser known texts. The poetic contribution to the movement is rather more competently examined in Darcy Gomes Neto's 'O Indianismo na Poesia Brasileira: Contradiçoes Ideológicas (Do Arcadismo ao Modernismo)' (unpublished Master's dissertation, Pontificia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, 1982). Gomes Neto's thesis is that the colonial sources used by the Romantic Indianists are already ideologically loaded and that it is therefore the writers' reactions to those sources which must be analysed. However, although this does reveal a number of important ideological contradictions and incoherences, it nevertheless prevents a more constructive view of the movement's significance from emerging and leads to conclusions which are sometimes less than illuminating, e.g. that the sentiments expressed in Gonçalves Dias's 'Canto Natalicio' are those of white, rather than Indian, society (p. 179). The author's concern with the historical referents within the texts means that the historical conditions experienced by the authors are largely ignored. David Haberly's Three Sad Races: Racial Identity and National Consciousness in Brazilian Literature (New York, 1983), meanwhile, includes chapters on Gonçalves Dias and Alencar, within a general theory of racial identity that is essentially Thomas Skidmore's concept of 'whitening' {Black into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought (New York, 1974) ): the coloured intellectual's resentment of and desire to escape his origins. The book's weakness is its narrow dependence on this argument, and on the notion of a perennial Brazilian search for the Lost Eden, at the expense of any deeper consideration of the society which produced these writers. More promising directions are suggested by several shorter studies. Affonso Romano de Sant' Anna's structural analysis of O Guarani ('O Guarani', in Análise Estrutural de Romances Brasileiros (Petrópolis, 1973), pp. 54-83) gives a detailed elucidation of the complex of relationships between the novel's characters, even if it does lead to a mistaken interpretation of the final cataclysm. The chief value of Walnice Nogueira Galväo's 'Indianismo Revisitado', in Esboço de Figura: Homenagem a Antonio Càndido (Sâo Paulo, 1979)i PP-379-91» *s that it recommends a re-evaluation of Romantic Indianism as part of a complete stuay of the literature on Indians, including the most recent developments. Silviano Santiago's articles, 'Roteiro para urna Leitura Intertextual de Ubirajara', in José de Alencar, Ubirajara, fourth edition (Säo Paulo, 1976), pp. 5-9, and 'Liderança e Hierarquia em Alencar', in Vale Quanto Pesa (Ensaios sobre Questöes Político-Culturáis) (Rio de Janeiro, 1982), pp. 89-116, offer important points of departure for situating Alencar within the cultural and political environ- ment of the Second Reign.</page><page sequence="2">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 57 The present contribution is a much condensed summary of what I believe will be the first account of Brazilian Indianism to examine the movement in its totality, as more than a mere succession of Romantic variations on a theme. In this form the essay will be concerned less with factual detail, and rather more with offering a framework for a more comprehensive history of the movement, one that will take account of the variety of works belonging to it. The backbone of that framework is my view that (a) anyone who troubles to read a selection of Indianist texts other than those of Gonçalves Dias and José de Alencar, will be struck by considerable differences in technical and stylistic treatment, narrative or poetic levels of discourse, theme and ideological position, between the writers concerned, and that (b) these differences are only fully comprehensible if seen in the context of the wider political changes affecting the century as a whole. For the problem is this: nineteenth-century Indianism is a clearly definable tradition spanning fifty years and embracing at least thirty works of fiction and poetry. Yet, despite the volume of literature and the duration of the movement, it continues to be described as a more or less uniform and static phenomenon, whose language, imagery, and central protagonist, the Indian 'knight', were definitively fixed by Gonçalves Dias and José de Alencar. Indeed, the exceptional quality and character of these two writers has meant that an admittedly mediocre, but not inconsiderable body of minor Indianists has been virtually ignored; consequently there has been no attempt to evaluate just how exceptional or typical the two major figures are in relation to the Indian mainstream. The only concession made to any notion of historical evolution has been the identification of Alencar's letters attacking the Indianist epic poem, A Confederaçao dos Tamoios, which are considered to mark the rise and predominance of the novel within the movement. The polemic surrounding A Confederaçao dos Tamoios certainly does represent a significant stage in the development of Brazilian Indianism; but it must be viewed, along with the attitudes of its instigator, Alencar, against a broader background of historical change which is registered on a literary level by the movement as a whole. For the half-century which connects the earliest and latest Indianist works, from 1835 to 1888, was also a period of major shifts in the balance of power between the Crown, the parliamentary parties, and the more radical dissenting voices which threatened the unity and stability of Empire itself. Here I shall identify three stages in that political evolution and in the corresponding development of Indianist literature: the first, of Independence, civil conflict, and marginalization (1835-50), during which the Indian is typically portrayed as a victim of the military and social consequences of Conquest; the second, of Conciliation (1850-70), whose crowning achievement is Alencar's Peri, the self- sacrificing saviour and ally of the white community, and the third, of Abolitionism, Republicanism, and Realism (1870-88), in which the tried</page><page sequence="3">58 DAVID H. TREECE and tested formulae of the classic Indianist texts begin to lose their credi- bility, and the faithful tribal servant becomes a rebel. The brief chronology which follows this analysis is intended as a reference tool and supplement to my examination of the parallel evolutions of literature and politics as manifested in the Indianist movement. I. Independence, Civil Conflict, and Marginalization (1835-50) The first of these phases, lasting from 1835 to about 1850, is the period of open conflict and instability following the forced abdication of Pedro I, when successive Regency governments were confronted with a number of violent provincial uprisings expressing a range of demands for Liberal reforms and greater decentralization of power. The promise of fundamental changes in the system and policies of government, giving substance to the country's nominal independence from Portugal, had come to nothing; the traditional oligarchies of Portuguese origin and descent retained their hold on an archaic colonial power structure and as a result, violent reaction to that continued ethnic and class dominance extended over eighteen years. Thousands died during these upheavals and in the military repression which ended them; for example, the Abrilada and Cabanada in Pernambuco (1832), the Cabanagem in Para (1835), the Balaiada in Maranhäo (1838-45), the Sabinada in Bahia (1837-38), the Farrapos war in Rio Grande do Sul (1835-45) and the Revoluçao da Praia in Recife (1848).2 One of these conflicts, the Cabanagem, is of particular interest because of its special racial import, most of those involved being blacks, mestiços or Indians; as such it serves to focus one of the more pernicious consequences of government indigenist policy during the eighteenth century: the alienation of the tapuio, or detribalized Indian, from both tribal and white society. For it was an ironic consequence of the 1750 Emancipation Laws of the Portuguese enlightened despot, Pombal, that legislation designed to 'liberate' the indigenous communities from the Jesuit mission systems of labour and social organization in fact exposed them to a process of increased tribal disintegration, exploitation, and marginalization. It was this dis- persed, landless mass, ill-prepared to compete socially or economically with the rest of the regional population, which formed the great reserve labour force in the Amazon, whose discontent was to explode in revolt during the Cabanagem.3 By the close of the eighteenth century, meanwhile, the Pomba- line legislation had been abolished, and those tribes which continued to resist the opening up of their lands to colonization and agriculture became 2 See José Honorio Rodrigues, Conciliaçao e Reforma no Brasil: Um Desafio Histórico-Cultural, second edition (Rio de Janeiro, 1982), pp. 51-55. 3 Carlos de Araújo Moreira Neto, A Política Indigenista brasileira durante o beculo xix (doctoral thesis presented to the Chair of Anthropology, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, Säo Paulo, i97i),p.5.</page><page sequence="4">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 59 subject to a series of ruthless military campaigns: the 'Guerras Justas'. Ordered by Royal Decree, these campaigns involved vicious methods of extermination, with the revival of the seventeenth-century bandeiras, or pioneering and slaving expeditions, and they succeeded in virtually annihilating many of the tribes of Bahia, Säo Paulo, the Botocudos of Minas Gerais, and the Timbira of Maranhäo. The Cartas Regias were revoked only in 183 1, during the Regency, when the Indians became considered as orphans of the state under a revised and more intensive agricultural policy.4 Among those visitors to Brazil who observed and wrote of the bleak, depressed condition of the conquered races, their corruption and decay, was the French intellectual, Ferdinand Denis, justifiably considered to be the father of Brazilian Indianism. The implicit contrast presented by Denis's geographical and critical works (for example, Brésil, Résumé de l'histoire littéraire du Brésil) and his novel, Les Maxacalis, between the pure, intact tribal groups of the deep interior or distant colonial past, and the exiled, decadent caboclo of the present, is transferred to the Brazilian Indianist writing of the first phase. For, if the contemporary social reality of detribalization was evident to foreigner and Brazilian alike (Gonçalves Dias was the son of a cafusa, part Indian, part black, and grew up in regular contact with the Timbira of his native Maranhäo), most of the early Indianists chose rather to depict the primitive in his mythical, ideal state, before or upon the impact of Conquest, relying for their descriptive, ethnographical detail on the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century crónicas of Cardim and Brandäo.5 This is the classic, initial stage of Indianism in which, on Denis's recommendation,6 the 'history' and society of the country's indigenous peoples were rediscovered, reinvented and adopted as the cultural heritage which a young and recently independent nation did not possess. The 'Metamorphose Original - Moema, e Camorogi' ( 1 8 3 5 ) of the baiano poet and soldier of the Independence wars, Ladislau dos Santos Titara,7 demon- strates this process, where landscape and myth are fused to create an identity in opposition to that of the former colonial ruler, Portugal. The poem recounts the magical transformation of two Indian lovers (Moema and Camorogi) into familiar birds of the Brazilian forest as, unwillingly disturbed from his sleep, Camorogi turns angrily on Moema. The dorminhoco, or bird of indolence, is thus endowed with a mythical, human origin, while at 4 Oscar Beozzo, Lets e Regimentes das Missöes: Política Indigenista no Brasil (Säo Paulo, 1983), PP- 71-74- 5 Fernâo Cardim, Do Principio e Origem dos Indios do Brasil e dos seus Costumes, Adoraçao e Ceremonias (first published in English by the Hakluyt Society, 1625); Ambrosio Fernandes Brandâo, Diálogos das Grandezas do Brasil (e. 161 8), edited by Joäo Capistrano de Abreu (Rio de Janeiro, 19^0). 6 Jean Ferdinand Denis, Résumé de l'histoire littéraire du Portugal suivi du Résumé de l'histoire littéraire du Brésil (Paris, 1826), p. s 2.9. 7 Ladislau dos Santos Titara, Obras Poéticas (Bahia: Typographia do Diario, 1835), m&gt; 2^- 3</page><page sequence="5">6O DAVID H. TREECE the same time attributing a legendary tradition to the place of Camorogi (Camuruji), a town in the poet's home province of Bahia. This same identification of land and nation through the mediation of pseudo-Indian myth lies at the heart of Firmino Rodrigues Suva's obituary 'Nènia' (1837), often considered to be the germ of the Indianist movement, reproduced in various nineteenth-century anthologies and admired by Alencar and critics thereafter. Its most significant innovation is the voice of Niterói, the indigenous-named town opposite Rio de Janeiro in the Bay of Guanabara, and also the title of the first journal of Brazilian Romanticism. Niterói speaks as the Indian mother mourning the loss of her child, Francisco Bernardino Ribeiro, himself a poet and teacher at the Säo Paulo Law Faculty, the intellectual breeding-ground of Imperial Brazil. Ribeiro is therefore one of the most eminent representatives of the new, Independent, ruling-class culture being consolidated in the country and as such he is embraced and mourned by the maternal, indigenous symbol of the national capital as a son and inheritor of an uninterrupted native identity: Sem do, nem compaixäo robou-me a morte Do meu cocar a penna mais mimosa, A joia peregrina de meu cinto, O lirio mais formoso das campiñas, O lume de meus olhos! - Oh! meu filho, Inda canta a araponga, e 0 rio volve Na ruiva areia a lóbrega corrente; Inda retouca a laranjeira a coma Verde-negre de flores alve jantes, E tu já nâo existes! ! - Sol brilhante, Numen de meus pais, que he do meu filho? Ó Tupa, ó Tupa, que mal te hei feito?8 But it is the imminence of Conquest, the impending destruction of that timeless, mythical world, that provides the richer and more characteristic symbolism of Indianist writing during the first period. On the first, most obviously political level it supplies the Independence cause with an ideo- logical and historical legitimacy, by identifying the interests of the Indian and Brazilian in their struggle against Portuguese colonial oppression. In Titara's epic poem, Paraguassu, the foundation myth of Santa Rita Duräo's Caramurú is radically reinterpreted so as to highlight the role of the Indian heroine as a precursor of the nineteenth-century Independence forces. Tribal names appear frequently in the poem, sometimes referring to white nationalist forces, for example, the 'Novos Tupinambás', and sometimes to regiments of conscripted Indians. As a result, Brazilian and Indian soldiers fighting under the same banner become indistinguishable, their cause and 8 Firmino Rodrigues Silva, 'Nènia, ao meu bom amigo o Dr. Francisco Bernardino Ribeiro', Minerva Brasiliense, 11, no. 18 (15 July 1844), 560.</page><page sequence="6">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 6l the fatherland they are defending become identical, so that the officer Carvalhal is able to encourage his men with the example of a tradition of Indian bravery and self-sacrifice that is at once their own: 'Que o morrer pela Patria he vida honrosa,/Muito ha, Tupiniquins, que sabéis bravos.'9 At a time when the civil revolts of the Regency are still imbued with a considerable dose of anti-Portuguese sentiment, then, Indianism is domi- nated by the military theme, the masculine cult of war, in an anti-colonialist battle that reflects a general atmosphere of social and political conflict. In the words of Gonçalves Dias's 'Cançâo do Tamoio' to the new-born Indian child, Nâo chores, meu filho, Nâo chores, que a vida E luta renhida: Viver é lutar. A vida é combate, Que os fracos abate, Que os fortes, os bravos, So pode exaltar.10 Indeed, it is Gonçalves Dias who brings to this atmosphere of conflict a special, personal intensity, focusing on the themes of struggle, freedom, alienation and marginalization with all their social and ideological impli- cations. Born in 1823, the illegitimate son of a Portuguese shopkeeper and a cafusa, he experienced at first hand the meaning of political conflict, social injustice and personal isolation: the family flight from Nationalist reprisals; early years lived amongst black slaves from the cotton plantations of Maranhäo and the 'indios mansos' who came to trade in the towns and villages; his father's desertion of his mother, and a loveless childhood with his stepmother's family; economic dependence and the instability caused by the Balaiada revolt, and the apparent racial snub which ended his first hopes of marriage.11 Gonçalves Dias was also aware of the deprivations of those social groups on whose labour the wealth of Empire depended. In his non-fictional writings he addresses the atrocious living and working conditions of Indians he met on a journey to the Rio Negro in 1861;12 the cultural annihilation which their ancestors suffered at the hands of the Jesuits;13 the unavoidable reality of mass black slavery and the consequent economic redundancy of the Indian, denounced in the apocalyptic vision of Brazilian society, Medi- tacäo.

TREECE concentric circles between the white man and the African; alienated from the machinery of power and irrelevant to the dominant labour structure of Empire, the Indian floats in a dispossessed, marginal limbo: Qual será o nosso logar entre os homens que sao senhores, e os homens que sao escravos? Nao queremos quinhoar o pao do escravo, e nâo nos podemos sentar à meza dos ricos e dos poderosos. E no entanto este solo abençoado produz fructos saborosos em todos os quadros do anno - suas florestas abundam de caca - e os seus rios sao piscosos. Os brancos governam - os negros servem - bem é que nos sejamos livres. Vivamos pois na indolencia e na ociosidade, pois que nâo necessitamos trabalhar para viver. Separemo'-nos, que é força separarmo'-nos, lembremo'-nos porém que somos todos irmäos, e que a nossa causa é a mesma.14 It is not difficult to discern in this image of a class apart a resemblance to that other sector of Brazilian society which, for other reasons, was excluded from the central axis of the Brazilian economy: the white, landless artisans, traders and civil servants who, in the industrial countries of Europe, constituted an increasingly powerful middle class, but who remained impo- tent in the essentially feudal society of Imperial Brazil. Gonçalves Dias, with his experience of material insecurity, an abortive, disillusioning adventure into party politics and an undistinguished, fitful career in education, journalism and diplomacy, had more than sufficient cause to be aware of his own part in that process of social marginalization. It is from that environment of socio-political conflict and alienation, then, that Gonçalves Dias's Indianism derives its force and significance. Poems such as 'O Canto do Piaga' and 'Deprecaçâo' convey the psychological impact and trauma of Conquest, in the same apocalyptic terms that are used to describe the recent provincial upheavals of the Regency, for example 'A Desordem de Caxias' and 'A Restauraçâo do Rio Grande do Sul'. History, like the eternal round of ritual war and reprisal in the Indian world, is not progressive but cyclical; both are afflicted by inexplicable cataclysms that appear, in their destruction and chaos, to be the retribution of a wrathful God. Compare, for instance, the last few lines of 'Dies Irae': Satisfez-se o Senhor. Que resta? - O caos, O horror, a confusäo, o vulto enorme Do tempo, que escurece o fundo abismo, Onde por todo o sempre jaz cativo; E da morte o cadáver gigantesco Quasi ocupando a superficie inteira Dum mar de chumbo, escuro e sem rumores. 14 Obras Posthumas de A.

Vossos Deuses, ó Piaga, conjura, Susta as iras do fero Anhangá. Manitôs já fugiram da Taba, Ó desgraça! ó ruina! ó Tupa!15 If, on one hand, Gonçalves Dias's Indianism records the violent chaos and disintegration that, for him, were common both to the recent history of Brazil and to the colonial encounter between Indian and white, then the poetry is also an imaginative attempt to recuperate the absent or lost harmony of those worlds. In that sense, Gonçalves Dias is probably closest to the spirit of the philosophy whose general influence was so important to Romanticism and Liberalism in general, and to Indianist notions of a noble savage in particular: Rousseau's Discours sur l'origine et les fondements de l'inégalité parmi les hommes (1755). In attempting to rediscover the origi- nal, primitive self of Western man, 'l'homme naturel', Rousseau takes those observed cases of tribal peoples, such as the Venezuelan Caribs, as an intermediate stage in man's development, an ideal condition of physical and spiritual harmony. Many of Gonçalves Dias's poems evoke a similar world, one which, for all its wars, and even because of them and their ritual, was in perfect harmony with itself until the arrival of the European. In perhaps the best known of his poems, 4I-Juca-Pirama', we are shown in a dramatic form the successful and victorious reintegration of the Indian into the ritual society and culture from which he has been torn by Conquest. Two aspects of the poem are rarely remarked upon, which nevertheless are vital to this dramatic structure and to the force of the reintegration which takes place. The first of these concerns the identity and origins of the young prisoner, thought by the Timbira warriors in the first and third sections to be unknown, without tribe or family. In the 'Canto de morte' he reveals that he and his father are the last survivors of a tribe that fell victim to the foreign invader ('Vi fortes - escravos!/De estranhos ignavos/ Calcados aos pés' {Poesia Completa, p. 361) ). They have been wandering in exile as if only in order finally to rediscover their lost world in another place, amongst the Timbira; that rediscovery is made, ironically, as the young warrior is 15 Poesia Completa e Prosa Escolhida, pp. 261-62, and p. 106, respectively.</page><page sequence="9">64 DAVID H. TREECE attempting to defend the last remnants of his family and tribal identity, to protect his blind, decrepit father. The request to be spared from execution in order to perform this last act of filial and tribal responsibility is interpreted both by the Timbira and by his father as a sign of cowardice and therefore, paradoxically, as a denial of traditional values punishable by a second, more absolute exile. When the son reacts to this accusation and proves his bravery in battle with the whole tribe, his restoration to his father is correspondingly absolute, like the homecoming of the biblical Prodigal Son: 'Este, sim, que é meu filho muito amado! 'E pois que o acho em firn, quai sempre o tive, 'Corram livres as lágrimas que choro, 'Estas lágrimas, sim, que nao deshonram. (P-37o) But, what is perhaps more impressive yet never fully recognized, the conclusion of the story is the ultimate form of ritual incorporation of the individual into the tribe: death by cannibalism. Interpreting cannibalism not as proof of primitive barbarism, but as ritual, the poem confirms the celebration of the Indian's rediscovery of the tribe in both literal and symbolic terms, seeing him assimilated into its body and fulfilling the execution which was announced at the beginning: ' Y-Juca-Pirama' - 'o que há-de ser morto, e que é digno de ser morto.' If Gonçalves Dias's major literary achievement was the imaginative recreation of an ideal alternative to his own contemporary world of chaos, conflict and alienation, another Indianist from a similar background, Antonio Gonçalves Teixeira e Sousa, was less able or willing to transcend the social reality of his time. Teixeira e Sousa was the eldest of five children born to a Portuguese trader and his black mistress in Santa Helena, Cabo Frió, in 18 12. The Independence crisis led his father into heavy debt and Antonio, who was already studying Latin, was obliged to become appren- ticed as a carpenter. While still a young man he suffered the deaths of his entire family, and in 1840 moved permanently to Rio, where he had completed his apprenticeship. It was in Rio that he met and began a lifelong friendship with the future publisher, Francisco de Paula Brito, also a mulatto from a modest family of artisans. The association with Paula Brito requires some comment, since it and certain aspects of Os Très Dias de um Noivado point to the existence of a small group within the Brazilian intellectual community whose conscious- ness of their racial and social origins led them to adopt a critical, pessimistic view of life under Empire. Unlike some of the most eminent apologists of the Imperial status quo, such as Gonçalves de Magalhâes, Pôrto-Alegre, or Alencar, these writers did not enjoy the advantages of financial security, ancestral respectability, and a prestigious political, diplomatic or military career. Jean-Michel Massa describes Paula Brito as a self-made man, and it</page><page sequence="10">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 65 was due to his idealism, generosity, and willingness to take risks in spite of considerable financial difficulties, that many such young writers were encouraged and their first works made available to the public.16 More specifically, he gave Teixeira e Sousa the moral support and stimulus that his social status denied him elsewhere in the artistic establishment.17 Moreover, as a source of continuity and personal encouragement, Paula Brito may have offered the solidarity needed by mulatto writers who, like himself, found their material obstacles to self-improvement multiplied by virtue of their race. For another mulatto, Machado de Assis, was also employed by Paula Brito during the early years of his career, before he began publishing his first volumes of poetry and the novels. The poems of Machado's Americanas, a late contribution to Brazilian Indianism, belong to the third phase of the movement; but their concern with the problem of social alienation suggests a point of continuity with Teixeira e Sousa's bitterly pessimistic brand of Indianism. Teixeira e Sousa's Os Très Dias de um Noivado (1844)18 is untypical of early Indianism as far as its historical setting and the social condition of its characters are concerned. The date of 171 5 is specified at the beginning of the text, indicating a context of well-established colonization, long after the initial encounter between white and Indian; the protagonists are a con- verted, 'civilizado' Guarani and a mestica, Miry'ba, recalling the Marabá of Gonçalves Dias's poem. Os Très Dias deals, then, not with the archetypal colonial clash of the races in the golden age of unadulterated tribal culture, but with the social and historical consequences of that clash. However, it differs fundamentally from the 'conciliatory' Indianism of Alencar, with its alliances and marriages. For here the marriage is a childless, futureless one, interrupted after three days by the tragic weight of history, racial conflict and alienation. The young couple, Corimbaba and Miry'ba, return newly married to the idyllic scenery of a village in Cabo Frió, and enjoy the traditional indigenous celebrations. However, the success of the marriage is marred by Miry'ba's memory of the occasion which brought the couple together, her mother's death, and by her increasing sense of exile and isolation. On the day following their wedding-night, Corimbaba contradicts his wife's wishes and accompanies his friends on a hunting expedition, during which be becomes separated from the rest and drifts far around the coast in his canoe. Inland he comes across an ancient solitary, who tells him of his disillusionment with humanity and who advises Corimbaba to visit the 'caverna dos mysteriös'. 16 Jean-Michel Massa, 'La Jeunesse de Machado de Assis (1839-70): Essai de biographie intellec- tuelle' (doctoral thesis, University of Poitiers, undated), 1, 87.

TREECE There, an oracle develops the mysterious symbolism of an earlier incident involving the deaths of a boy and of a dove; it is a parable of jealousy and hasty conclusions which anticipates the tragic outcome of the story. For, waiting in despair for the return of her husband, Miry'ba has fainted in the arms of a stranger who knocks at the door; it is her Portuguese father who, believed dead, has been searching for her since he was shipwrecked. However, when Corimbaba returns to the house and sees his wife in the arms of another man he misinterprets the situation and stabs Miry'ba, who has time only to reveal the truth before she dies and is followed by the suicide of Corimbaba. The bare bones of the plot, then, appear to tell the story of a marriage destroyed by mistrust and jealousy, confirming the old man's pessimistic view of the human condition and conforming to the fatal forces of the oracle's premonition. But the precedents in the lives of the characters, their origins and social instability, form a more oppressive background which hangs over the marriage and provides the more interesting historical and racial implications of the tragedy. In one of a number of passages with unmistakable autobiographical and sociological connotations, Miry'ba bears witness to her personal sense of social alienation which, in spite of the common experience that should draw her to the Indians, nevertheless isolates her from both communities. For she is a mestica, neither Indian nor white and, as if to intensify this ethnic and social limbo, she has been orphaned by the deaths of her parents, abandoned to a future of exile and dependency: Irei, sem vos, vagar na terra estranha (Continúa outra vez) sem esperanças! Hei de corner o pao da caridade, Molhado pelo pranto da miseria! Ao passar pela estrada os caminhantes Me dirâo - alii vae urna estrangeira, Vagabunda entre nos: seus paes nasceram Aonde ninguém sabe; e nem cuidaram Em lhe deixar sustento; - e desta sorte Todos me julgaräo filha lançada, Alta noute, ñas portas dos visinhos! Ah! que eu serei olhada com desprezo, Obrigada a pedir, ou condemnada A servir, como escrava, e assim a vida Me será mais penosa do que a morte! (Canto 11.76) The seeds of racial disharmony have already been sown, then, and pollute the marriage from the beginning; but the actual tragedy is precipitated by the symbolic return of Miry'ba's white blood in the form of her missing father, who inspires Corimbaba's mistaken jealousy. Here too, though, Teixeira e Sousa ventures beyond the mythical expression of the racial divide to</page><page sequence="12">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISMI IN BRAZIL 6j highlight its more concrete social consequences; during his account to Corimbaba of the atrocities and hardships suffered by the Indians, the old man of the forest especially condemns the racial prejudice which excluded them from social advancement of any kind: Näo vi mais que a injustiça em toda parte! A cor do homem, accidente mero, (Fallo pois dos cabouclos destas terras) Foi à perseguiçâo pretexto infame! Teve-se em menor conta os seus serviços, E olhou-se com desprezo os seus talentos, Seus feitos, seu valor, suas virtudes! E a baca cor da pelle era barreira Aos empregos, e premios merecidos! (Canto iv. 54) While the context of Liberal ideas in the first half of the nineteenth century would certainly have encouraged this attack on colonial attitudes to the Indian, Teixeira e Sousa's own racial origins as a mulatto must undeniably have made him acutely aware of the social disadvantages of being poor and coloured. Moreover, the coincidence of certain of the author's biographical circumstances with those of his female protagonist suggests that Teixeira e Sousa may well be making the poem a vehicle for an uncompromising denunciation of social conditions under Empire for the landless, classless mulatto. Both Miry'ba and the author are of mixed race, both are orphaned, the poem being dedicated to the author's parents (Teixeira e Sousa also lost his four brothers and sisters) and both are separated from their family home, obliged to live in an unfamiliar environment in poverty, dependent upon the favour of others. Miry'ba's lament on her orphanhood and her song of exile, whose emphasis is otherwise difficult to account for, now acquire a secon- dary significance, speaking both for the author and for a whole sector of Brazilian society under Empire: Por graça em mesa alhéa Feliz quern nao comeu; Feliz quern näo bebeu Ñas festas dos estranhos! (Canto in. 1 2) II. Conciliation Os Très Dias de um Noivado and the poetry of Gonçalves Dias are a far cry from the first Indianists' patriotic celebration of Brazilian independence and collective national identity. Testifying instead to a divided, prejudice-ridden society haunted by the exiled 'tribes' of landless, powerless freemen, they also bear little relation to the kind of Indianism which followed - Alencar's mythology of Indian/white relations based on collaboration, self-sacrifice,</page><page sequence="13">68 DAVID H. TREECE and conciliation. The clear change in thematic preoccupations and ideologi- cal positions which occurs at this stage of the Indianist movement coincides with a new political atmosphere, one that provided the conditions for two of the most economically stable and prosperous decades of Empire. That stability depended, as José Honorio Rodrigues describes, on the confidence of the ruling, land-owning élite in the maintenance of its status quo for the foreseeable future and in the postponement or avoidance of the fundamental reforms demanded by Liberal politicians: A conciliaçâo e a inconciliaçâo, a historia cruenta e incruenta alternam-se no processo histórico brasileiro, mas foi a partir de 1849 que se buscou urna formula para evitar que os liberáis, aliados naturais dos conservadores, participassem das correntes mamelucas radicáis e ameaçassem, pela sua colaboraçâo mais poderosa e inteligente, o poder econòmico latifundiário: este precisava de tranqüilidade e de ordern para os seus negocios. (Conciliaçâo e Reforma no Brasil, pp. 57-58) Thus, by the middle of the century, the radical ideological and civil conflicts which characterized the first three decades of Independence, and the Indian- ist writing of that period, were provisionally resolved, if only on a superficial level, by certain, relatively innocuous concessions to Liberal reformism and by a conscious policy of compromise between the two parliamentary parties. In 1850 the Queiróz Law was passed, abolishing the traffic in slaves from Africa and, although the internal slave trade continued alive and well, this advance went some way towards neutralizing abolitionist opinion and towards preserving Brazil's moral image abroad. These circumstances help to illuminate the ambiguous attitude towards slavery to be found in Cobé, the only surviving original theatrical contri- bution to the Indianist movement. Published in 1 8 5 2 by Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, the popular novelist, Liberal politician and author of the abolition- ist work, As Vítimas Algozes, Cobé establishes one of the fundamental myths or formulae of Indianist writing of the second phase, especially in the work of Alencar - the self-sacrifice of the Indian as a voluntary slave. On the one hand, the very literal self-sacrifice which takes place in Cobé may be interpreted as a martyrdom, a means of exposing the indefensible human demands imposed by one class upon another; nevertheless, the language and action of the play make a strong appeal to the Judeo-Christian tradition of sacrifice in the context of salvation. The legitimacy of the white community as the object of that salvation is never put into question. The play is set in the familiar Indianist territory of the 1560 war between the Portuguese and the French, with their Tamoio allies, which led to the founding of Rio de Janeiro. A prisoner of the Portuguese and slave to the household of Dom Rodrigo, the young Indian Cobé is, on the one hand, compelled to accept his captivity out of love for Rodrigo's daughter, Branca, and on the other hand is pressed, by his own guilt and the bitter reproaches of his mother, to escape and rejoin his tribesmen. Meanwhile, Branca,</page><page sequence="14">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 69 unaware of Cobé's feelings, has resolved to commit suicide since, despite her love for Estácio, a soldier of lower birth, she has been promised to the villain Dom Gil, who is one of the Indians' most hated oppressors. The play is steeped in the literal and metaphorical language of slavery, which is used to define each of these relationships set up by the plot. Cobé's mother, Agassamu, curses her son for submitting to the slavery that has subjected an entire race under the colonial yoke; he realizes that, if married to Branca, Dom Gil, its cruellest, archetypal perpetrator, would become his personal master. Meanwhile, Branca's song of the captive Indian encapsu- lates the impossible emotional situation of Cobé, a slave to his love for the white woman, yet prevented by his servile condition from fulfilling that love. Branca, whose symbolic name unmistakably associates her with the just cause of the white community, is to be the slave of a colonial tyrant whom she is forced to marry. 'Vossa escrava serei, nao vossa esposa', she tells Dom Gil, whilst confessing that her heart is the willing captive of the man she loves: 'Presa tenho a minh'alma, e até confesso/ Que amo, que beijo meus queridos ferros.' Later, when Cobé holds in his hands the fatal poison which could deliver her from her torture, she declares, begging on her knees: 'És agora o senhor ... eu sou a escrava.'19 The act which dissolves all these different bonds of slavery and restores social relations to their just state is Cobé's decision to take the poison himself and then kill Dom Gil. In so doing, he avenges his personal honour, the crimes against his people, saving the heiress of the white community from its oppressor, and resolving his own impossible love. This is not a martyrdom imposed on the Indian by an unjust society, but a free and rationally meditated decision which he chooses in homage to the moral values of the community whose representative he wishes to save. For just as his love for Branca redeems him from his heathen, savage condition ('Quando seus olhos para mim se volvem,/Meu furor de seivagem desaparece', pp. 3 5-36), his self-sacrifice acquires the consecration of the Christian oath by which he swears to save Branca. We can speculate as to whether Cobé actually provided the blueprint for Alencar's ideal slave, Peri; what is at least certain is that the play reflects a belief in the need to subjugate individual interests to the preservation of the Imperial state - the same belief which, as we shall see later in this section, led Alencar to oppose the campaign for abolition of slavery. Meanwhile, the political expression of this softening of ideological posi- tions and demands for the sake of the 'national good' was Conciliation, which became official policy under the government of the Marquis of Paraná (September 1853-May 1857). It signified the renunciation by both Conservative and Liberal parties of their narrow, partisan and personal 19 Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Teatro Completo, 11 (Rio de Janeiro, 1979), p. 71.</page><page sequence="15">JO DAVID H. TREECE antagonisms, of non-consultative, coercive methods of government and decision-making, and a willingness to consider new ideas.20 One of its opponents, Justiniano José da Rocha, questioned the meaning of this period of ' transaçâo' in the following terms: E que movimento social era esse que todos os políticos pressentiam, a que obedeciam, que lhes fazia abandonar as suas posiçoes de vencedores, senäo o resultado da conviccäo íntima do país de que estavam extintas todas as paixöes, acabadas todas as lutas do passado? E essa extinçâo das paixöes, esse esquecimento de odios, o que sao senäo os sintomas evidentes de que a sociedade tem chegado a esse período feliz de calma e de reflexäo que pode e deve ser aproveitado para a grande obra da transaçâo?21 Even such an opponent of Conciliation warned of the political and social upheavals which could result if some balance and order were not restored to the representative machinery of government: Se porém perder-se o ensejo; se os anos de 185561856 correrem tâo infecundos para a grande causa da transaçâo como correr am os très anos que lhes precederam; se o poder compreender tâo mal o seu dever para com a patria, que continue exagerando cada vez mais as suas conquistas, entäo ... Ah! quern sabe se os defensores da causa nacional, da causa da liberdade e da ordern, nâo terâo de ir defendê-la contra as exageraçoes de urna nova reaçâo democrática nos seus limites extremos da ordern social, näo teräo de ir defendê-la, näo já contra os que quiseram a supressäo do senado, a ruina de insti tuiçoes essenciais, mas contra os que acometeram todo o edificio político, e todo o edificio social, contra os que quiserem urna constituinte! (pp. 218-19) While the Paraná ministry represented a postponement of open political conflict, an ideological battle at another, different level still remained to be resolved: the status of the Indian within national economic and agricultural policy. With the 1845 Regulamento, the blatantly repressive indigenist policy of 'Guerra Justa' began to be replaced, at least on an official level, with a more conciliatory programme of integration. Certain guarantees were now offered to those Indians who had survived extermination, admin- istration of the mission villages was handed over to Italian Capuchin friars, and the 1850 Lei de Terras, consolidating the power of the latifundiários, moved smallholders, sertanejos, and Indians from their traditional lands to areas where they were more effectively subject to economic and social control. The new policy was to a large extent a response to the labour shortage which occurred in certain areas and was anticipated elsewhere, as a result of the abolition of the African slave traffic. The idea of replacing black with Indian labour was opposed by those powerful farmers, such as senator Vergueiro, who were committed to an export agriculture based on slavery or who were involved in colonization projects using European immigrants. One defender of such interests was the historian Varnhagen; his polemical 'Memorial Orgànico' began a debate whose parallels and connexions with 20 Honorio Rodrigues, pp. 57-66. 21 Raymundo Magalhâes Júnior, Tres Panfletanos do Segundo Remado (bao l'aulo, 1956), p. 216.</page><page sequence="16">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 71 the literary debate surrounding A Confederaçao dos Tamoios have not previously been recognized, even though, as we shall now see, the partici- pants in each case were prominent intellectuals and writers, many of them Indianists. An important vehicle for Liberal views on Abolition and on a more conciliatory indigenist policy was the artistic, scientific, and literary review, Guanabara, edited by Porto- Alegre, Gonçalves Dias and Macedo during the years 1849-55. Besides these political articles, Guanabara published liter- ary material of an Indianist nature - Macedo's Cobé, and a short story, Aricó e Caocochee, by Joäo Henrique Helliot - as well as historical and social comment, such as Gonçalves Dias's 'Reflexöes sobre os Annaes Históricos de Maranhäo' and Meditacäo. It is therefore not difficult to understand the storm caused by the appearance in the journal of Varnhagen's 'Memorial Orgànico' (185 1), which set out a programme for the future colonization of the interior, giving advantages to the European immigrant while envisaging the exclusion of both African and Indian from a share in that future. The Indian was considered a physical obstacle to this development and to the progress of civilization under Empire; a nomadic invader, he had neither a right to possession of the land he occupied, nor the moral or intellectual capacity to govern himself. Furthermore, as 'urna gente estranha ao pacto social', an outlaw and barbarian, he could be subjected to the Aristotelian notion of 'just conquest', for which purpose the bandeiras might usefully be revived. One of the first published responses to these statements, exposing Varnhagen's concept of 'tutelage' as a new form of slavery, and the arguments on extermination as simply colonialist greed, was the article 'Civilizaçào dos Indígenas' (1852). Its author was Manuel Antonio de Almeida, whose highly popular novel, Memorias de um Sargento de Mili- cias, began to appear in the Correio Mercantil in the same year. Also in 1852, the very influential historian, critic, novelist, playwright and poet, Joaquim Norberto, wrote his 'Memoria Histórica e Documentada das Aldeias de Indios da Provincia do Rio de Janeiro', winning the Prèmio Imperial with its praise of the aldeia mission system and its attack on coercive colonial practices. The debate was given a fresh impulse when Varnhagen published his highly acclaimed Historia G er al do Brazil (1854), with its preface 'Os Indios perante a Nacionalidade Brazileira'. Here, accompanying an unashamedly crushing description of Indian customs, he gives his anti-Rousseauian view of tribal man: 'Desgraçadamente o estudo profundo da barbarie humana, em todos os países, prova que, sem os vínculos das leis e da religiäo, o triste mortal propende tanto à ferocidade, que quase se metamorfoseia em fera . . . ,'22 Conquest, meanwhile, was the 22 Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Historia Gerat do Brasil antes da sua Separaçao e Independen- cia de Portugal, seventh edition (Sao Paulo, 1959), i, 52-53-</page><page sequence="17">72 DAVID H. TREECE Indians' just deserts for their own expulsion of the earlier coastal inhabi- tants: 'A seu turno devia chegar-lhes o dia da expiaçao. Veio a trazê-lo o descobrimento e colonizaçâo, efectuados pela Europa crista' (p. 56). Varn- hagen even went to the trouble of finding a mythical 'Indianist' basis for his political and historical ideas; Sumé, Lenda Mytho-Religiosa Americana (1855), and an ironic, anti-Romantic ballad version of the Caramuru legend, constitute his peculiar contribution to Brazilian Indianism.23 After his failure to convert the Indian tribes to Christianity, the travelling evangel- ist Sumé laments their fate, the apocalyptic destruction which will punish their refusal to recognize God's law. Extermination, fulfilling this pseudo- biblical prophecy, is to make way for a subsequent age of peace and justice, the white civilization of Imperial Brazil: 'E Sumé sentado sobre urna pedra de granito chorava a sorte do povo condemnado, que deveria perecer ou fundir-se em outro povo pela presença de algum conquistador mais forte de espirito e coraçao, e bem quisto do Senhor.'24 Interestingly enough, one of the most vehement reactions to Varnhagen's views came from the historian Joäo Francisco Lisboa, a vigorous opponent of the literary Indianist movement. As Antonio Càndido has already noted, Lisboa objected to the Indianists' idealization of indigenous culture and society, to their tendency to exaggerate the inhumane behaviour of the Portuguese colonists.25 But although he mocked the poetry of the Primeiros and Ultimos Cantos, he considered Gonçalves Dias's historical statements on colonial abuses a valuable opening for serious discussion. His unfavour- able opinion of tribal culture does not prevent him from addressing seriously the philosophical problem of Indian rights. Under the pseudonym of Timon, he disputed Varnhagen's simplistic analysis: Deveras o Brasil näo poderia civilizar-se sem a escravidâo dos indígenas, conseguida pela força e pela guerra? Säo com efeito väos e ilusorios, simples fantasia de cabeças ocas, os meios brandos e persuasivos da catequese? Ou por outra, e generalizando estas idéias, a coaçao e o terror, a escravidâo e a guerra, säo os grandes e verdadeiros instrumentos de civilizaçao e de propaganda religiosa?26 Instead, he proposed a conciliatory solution, the peaceful coexistence of Indian and colonist to the mutual benefit of both parties: Sem duvida, por mais bárbaros que fossem, tinham os indígenas direito à propria conservaçâo, por meio dos dons que a terra fornece, ou espontáneos, ou solicitados pelo trabalho. Mas esse direito se podia conciliar, e tornar-se até mais ampio, real e eficaz, com a ocupaçâo simultánea dos europeus; porque a civilizaçao, sobre melhorar a condiçao 23 For a discussion of Varnhagen's role in the evolution of the Caramuru myth, see David Treece, 'Caramuru the Myth: Conquest and Conciliation', Ibero- Amerikanisches Archiv, io, no. 2 (1984), 24 Sumé, Lenda Mytbo-Religiosa Americana, Kjuanaoara (Kio üe Janeiro, 1050J, p. 30. 25 Formacao da Literatura brasileira, 11, 22. 26 Joào Francisco Lisboa, Cronica do Brasil Colonial (Apontamentos para a Historia do Maranhao) (Petrópolis, 1976), p. 588.</page><page sequence="18">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 73 moral dos selvagens, devia tornar-lhes mais facéis ao mesmo tempo todos gozos e cómodos da vida. A iniquidade pois consistiu, nâo na ocupaçâo da terra vaga e inculta, mas no abuso da opressäo e das vexaçôes exercidas contra as hordas errantes. (pp. 175-76) In this way, Liberal notions regarding the freedom of the individual are reconciled with the economic aspirations of those wishing to open up the Brazilian interior to further agricultural development. Along with Varnhagen's own essay 'Os Indios Bravos e o Sr. Lisboa' (1867), Lisboa's argument was subject to a 'Diatribe contra a Timonice do Jornal Maranhense' (1859), under the pseudonym of Erasmo. This author disputes Varnhagen's alleged hypocrisy on the slavery question and on the colonial treatment of the Indian and, at the same time, attacks Lisboa's attempt to justify the right of primitive tribes to their way of life: E certo, se nâo é lícito embargar aos indios ferozes a sua liberdade de viver corno quizerem, de se devorarem, e extinguirem mutuamente, e quem tiver a desgraça de lhes cair nas unhas, entào defende às escáncaras o canibalismo puro em opposiçâo com as instituí çoes civilisadoras, com a moral social e christä! Veja-se o absurdo resultado de sustentar proposiçoes absolutas e extremas, quando há falta de criterio!27 Although this cannot be factually verified, it is interesting to speculate whether the author of this 'Diatribe' is the same Erasmo who began his political 'Cartas de Erasmo' six years later: José de Alencar, whose views on Conciliation and whose fictional portrayal of the ideal relationship between the Indian and white society I shall now examine. Alencar made his resounding entry into the literary scene with his series of letters criticizing the epic Indianist poem A Confederaçao dos Tamoios (1856) by the prestigious figurehead of Brazilian Romanticism, Domingos José Gonçalves de Magalhäes. In i860 Magalhäes published one of the last substantial comments on Varnhagen's anti-indigenist views, 'Os Indígenas do Brasil perante a Historia', whose ambivalence explains to a large extent the anachronistic, reactionary nature of his poem. Despite paying lip-service to the conventional condemnation of colonial slavery and exploitation, and his avowed intention to 'reabilitar o elemento indígena que faz parte da populaçâo do Brasil', his essential loyalty to the values of white, European civilization differs little from that of Varnhagen. The landowners of colonial Brazil, he suggests, were not as ambitious or greedy as was commonly depicted, and the deplorable deeds that concerned modern historians were somehow exceptional and abhorrent to the majority of civilized Europeans. Meanwhile, his rehabilitation of the indigenous element is based, not on the value and integrity of tribal culture in its own right, but on those aspects which most appeared to resemble European civilization: the Indians' sense 27 Diatribe contra a Timonice do Jornal de Timon Maranhense acerca da Historia Geral do Brazil do Senhor Varnhagen (Lisbon, 1859), p. 34.</page><page sequence="19">74 DAVID H. TREECE of religion, their receptiveness to established European notions of justice, social order, government, and God-given freedom. What is more, in the epic A Confederaçao dos Tamoios, Magalhäes follows Varnhagen closely in his reliance on the principles of Providence and Divine Authority to justify the extermination of the Tamoios in the foundation of Rio. These Indians emerge as mythical heroes, not because they defended their homeland against the Portuguese colonialist forces, but because they died as part of God's plan, in a war which was to lead to the founding of the future capital of the Brazilian Empire. Magalhäes's poem and Alencar's criticisms of it were symptomatic of a crisis of credibility regarding the function of the Indianist theme. For the defenders of A Confederaçao, who included Porto Alegre and Pedro n, the poem celebrated the traditional Indianist values of Independence, patriot- ism, liberty, and religion; but the questions raised by Varnhagen's 'Memo- rial Orgànico' - the reality of tribal primitivism and the obstacle this posed to economic development - indicated that the defiant, exiled Indian warrior, as symbol of freedom and Independence, had outlived its useful- ness. Alencar's comments demonstrate an understanding that Independence had long since been consolidated and was no longer at issue. Rather, his interest lies not so much in themes of conflict, genocide, and the military ideal, but in those factors which led to the formation of the modern Brazilian: indigenous culture and psychology, and their effect on the Portu- guese language as spoken in Brazil; themes of sexual and social intercourse that might be suggested by female characters; the mythical origins of the Brazilian people - in short, the encounter and dialogue between two races, European and indigenous. Elsewhere, in his division of national literature into three stages of development - pre-colonial, colonial and Independent - Alencar defines the second phase as just that, a formative period of mestiçagem: O segundo período é histórico: representa o consorcio do povo invasor com a terra americana, que dele recebia a cultura, e lhe retribuía nos efluvios de sua natureza virgem e ñas reverberacöes de um solo espléndido. Ao conchego desta pujante criaçao, a tempera se apura, toma alas a fantasia, a linguagem se impregna de módulos mais suaves: formam-se outros costumes, e urna existencia nova, pautada por diverso clima, vai surgindo. É a gestaçâo lenta do povo americano, que devia sair da estirpe lusa, para continuar no novo mundo as gloriosas tradicóes de seu progenitor.28 Alencar's first Indianist work, O Guarani, portrays this process on a mythical level - the conflict and reconciliation of Portuguese and Indian that brings about the americana (Ceci) 's consciousness of her essential mesticidade. It bears witness to what Alencar considered to be the 28 'Bençâo Paterna', in Sonhos d'Ouro: Ficçao Completa (Rio de Janeiro, 1965), i, 495.</page><page sequence="20">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 75 'sociedade franca e democrática' of Brazil, and is the first conscious express- ion of the concept of racial or cultural democracy, whose chief proponent in the twentieth century is Gilberto Freyre.29 This belief in the formative importance for Brazilian society of a concili- ation of, or intercourse between, the European and indigenous races, naturally leads us to the question of Alencar's attitude towards political conciliation, and specifically to the policy of the Paraná ministry. During his two periods of practical involvement in politics, Alencar pursued a wilfully independent path, which alienated both his family's traditional electorate in Ceará, and his fellow Conservatives, who were embarrassed by his refusal to compromise his political ideals and toe the party line. His opinion of Conci- liation, expressed mainly in the newspaper crónicas of Ao Correr da Pena, which he wrote in 1855, the third year of the Paraná ministry, was equally unorthodox. It rejected what he saw as the false, spineless party conciliation of 'conversa', in which principles disappeared, convictions became confused and decisions followed the dictates of circumstance; while it retained the notion of a dynamic, active conciliation based on an effective opposition: Reabilite-se esta bela idéia da conciliacäo dos espiri tos, evite-se que seja substituida por urna conciliacäo de interesses individuáis: aceitem-se todas as adesöes, mas nao se suplique nem urna; chamem-se todas as inteligencias a concorrer para o bem do país, mas nao se exija urna transigencia imoral que nao pode ser duradoura: respeitem-se todas as opiniòes e deixe-se a oposiçâo inteiramente livre, porque se for leal, auxiliará o governo; se for licenciosa, se desacreditará por si mesma.30 He even proposed the formation of a new party of conciliation to be born out of this 'confusäo de idéias extremas' and replacing the existing parties, whose alleged decline and collapse he charts in the later Cartas de Erasmo. Fundamental to Alencar's notion of Conciliation is the role of the monarch as a disinterested arbitrator, the voice of the national conscience restraining the excesses of the government in power. In these open letters to Pedro II, Alencar shifts from a position of admiration and faith in the capacity of the Emperor to fulfil this role of moderator - 'Monarca, eu vos amo e respeito. Sois nestes tempos calamitosos de indiferentismo e descrença um entu- siasmo e urna fé para o povo' {Obra Completa, p. 1050, November 1865) - to one that is critical, exhorting him to a more responsible exercise of his political duties. After appealing to the example of the British parliamentary system, he describes the ideal function of this moderating Power: O Poder Moderador é o eu nacional, a consciência ilustrada do povo. Assim como a criatura humana no correr da vida é admoestada por um senso íntimo, que a obriga a 29 José de Alencar, 'Os "Sonhos d'Ouro"', in Obra Completa, iv (Rio de Janeiro, i960), p. 938: 'Mas nao será franca e democrática a sociedade onde se passam as cenas do romance?

Onde a fidalguia é representada por titulares de carregaçâo, como um baräo que foi tropeiro, um conde que foi belchior, e um conselheiro que tem casa de consignâmes?' 30 Obra Completa, iv, 748.</page><page sequence="21">76 DAVID H. TREECE refletir sobre a moralidade do ato que vai praticar; a naçao recebe do monarca o mesmo serviço; e muitas vezes o remordimento precursor da má paixäo evita suas consequências, obrigando o povo a refletir. (Obra Completa, p. 1085, 31 December 1865) But, looking back over the political history of the Second Reign, he concludes that if during Conciliation Pedro made insufficient use of his powers to dissolve the Lower Chamber, in the earlier and more contempor- ary periods of party conflict he took too little account of the strength of public opinion. This leads Alencar to his sustained attacks on what he saw as an absolutist tendency in the current regime, an abuse of 'o Poder Pessoal' which even prompted him to collaborate temporarily on the newly founded newspaper, A República. No doubt Alencar's failure to be selected for a life peerage, opposed by Pedro because the novelist was already Minister of Justice, provided Alencar with a personal experience of this 'poder pessoal'. But these arbitrary political actions, such as the 1868 appointment of the Itaborai Government in the face of an opposition majority, were becoming more evident, and signalled the end of the political consensus which, despite its ups and downs, had guaranteed Imperial rule for nearly fifty years. If, for Alencar, the continued stability and prosperity of Empire depended on a political system of tolerant government, effective opposition and the moderating power of the monarch, its principal economic base, slavery, was for him no less vital. It was thus that Alencar, while praising the Queiróz Law that abolished the traffic from Africa, voted against the Law of the Free Womb that was to mark the end of slavery in Brazil. The conditions of slavery could be reformed so as to make them 'humane', a view which he implemented as Minister of Justice, when he ended the practice of open slave auctions at the Valongo market. But as for the institution itself, '. . . por isso que é urna instituiçao condenada pela moral, urna instituiçao caduca, näo pode ser modificada: será extinta um dia, näo pode ser alterada'.31 Total and immediate abolition would lead to civil war and chaos, he believed, and could only come about when the general political and material emanci- pation of the Brazilian people had been achieved. O Guarani, published in the last year of the Paraná ministry, may be described as the classic novel of Conciliation, reproducing on a mythical level the elements of Alencar's thinking that have been outlined above: the dynamic, dialectic struggle of antagonistic political forces towards a more genuine national unity and progress; the translation of this onto a cultural level in the portrayal of mestiçagem, the marriage of two races, Indian and white, and the achievement of a mature self-awareness of a 'Brazilian' identity; the role of a moderating, restraining influence on the absolutist tendencies of those in power, and the need to legitimize an ideal, 'humane' form of slavery. This correspondence between the author's socio-political 31 Quoted in Luis Viana Filho, A Vida de José de Alencar (Rio de Janeiro 1979)* P- 2.2-8.</page><page sequence="22">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 77 ideology and his fiction is further confirmed by the fact that the basic plot structure of O Guarani is repeated in a whole series of regionalist novels representing the same power struggle and its successful resolution. O Tronco do Ipê, Til, and O Sertanejo all portray the crisis of a patriarchal regime ruled by a repressive fazendeiro (Joaquim Freitas, Luis Galväo, or Capitäo-Mor Campelo), the more contemporary equivalent of the fidalgo, Dom Antonio de Mariz, who is the colonial patriarch of O Guarani. And each of these novels sets the patriarch in conflict with a marginal figure (Mario, Joâo Fera, or Arnaldo), distanced from the source of power by his social circumstances, racial origins, or special relationship with the indi- genous, natural world, and who refuses to submit to the arbitrary tyranny of the fazendeiro. The plot of O Guarani concerns the family of the Portuguese fidalgo Dom Antonio de Mariz in its isolated 'fortress' somewhere between Rio and Säo Paulo at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and the events which lead to the destruction of all but two of its members. The son Dom Diogo is sent away early in the novel and thus survives to reappear in As Minas de Prata; the daughter Cecilia is saved by a Goitacá Indian, Peri, who adores the white Virgin and is dedicated to her protection. The destruction of the patriarchal community on the Paquequer river is brought about by internal and external forces: the undermining of its unity by a mutiny of its resident band of 'aventureiros', led by the power-crazy renegade missionary, Loredano; and by the attacks of the local Aimoré Indians, set off by the killing of one of the tribe's women at the hands of Dom Diogo. Dom Antonio's downfall is not simply an accident of fate, but obeys an internal necessity for change. The Aimoré attack on the Paquequer, and the killing of the india which precipitated it, are symptoms of the colonial community's alienation from the roots of the country's racial and cultural identity; and it is that alienation which is to be overcome on a mythical, ideal level by the new, independent generation of Ceci. Something that is critical to this interpretation of Dom Antonio's downfall as a necessary one, is the nature of his relationship to Spain and Portugal, and the notion of medieval chivalry which he represents. The novel is set at the beginning of the seventeenth century when Portugal, and therefore Brazil, were under Spanish rule. In loyalty to his country, Dom Antonio has laid down his arms rather than serve the Spanish, and has isolated himself in his 'little Portugal' on the Paquequer. As a first-generation colonist, a 'foreigner' in an alien land, Dom Antonio is asserting in this way his obstinately Portuguese identity, his attachment to the Old World: 'Aqui sou portugués, . . . Nesta terra que me foi dada pelo meu rei e conquistada pelo meu braco, nesta terra livre, tu reinarás, Portugal, como viveras na alma de teus filhos. Eu o juro!'32 32 José de Alencar, Obra Completa, 4 vols (Rio de Janeiro, i960), 11, 30. All references in the text are to this edition.</page><page sequence="23">78 DAVID H. TREECE It is the obsolete nature of Dom Antonio's patriarchal, medievalist values and his continued attachment to Portugal which make the destruction of his regime necessary, so that a new generation, that of Cecilia, can create a new, genuinely Brazilian society. The structure of the novel is therefore of fundamental importance to the understanding of its historical implications. In the first of the novel's four parts appear all the elements of conflict that motivate the rest of the plot: Isabel's despair in the face of her racial identity, and her attraction to Alvaro; Dona Lauriana's hatred of Peri and her attempts to have him expelled from the community; Dom Diogo's killing of the india and the discovery of her body by her tribespeople; and Loredano's conspiracy with Bento Simöes and Rui Soeiro. Despite its appearance of calm and stability, the patriarchal community of the Paquequer contains an inherent quality of precariousness which is symbolized by the location of the fortress, dominating the area but perched on the edge of a precipice. This precipice represents the way towards change, an abyss between two worlds which must be crossed but which carries with it the danger of destruction. The chasm outside Cecilia's window is the scene of several such moves towards change: it is there that Loredano drops the bracelet, Álvaro's gift to Cecilia, and so attempts to disrupt the conventional love-match between the couple; Peri must descend into its depths at risk to his life in order to retrieve the bracelet and restore the well-being of the community; it is by passing across a flimsy plank over the chasm that Loredano hopes to enter Cecilia's room and abduct her, realizing his destructive dream of power. On several occasions Loredano comments on the symbolic meaning of this precarious journey to power, such as when he convinces his accomplices of his irresistible influence over them: 'Quando urna vez se pos o pé sobre o precipicio, amigos, é preciso caminhar por cima dele, para nao rolar e ir ao fundo. Caminhemos pois' (p. 86). The Aimoré Indians eventually invade the house by scaling the cliffs of the 'abismo', thus destroying the barrier of apparent security which separated the community from chaos; and lastly, it is by crossing the bridge formed by a palm tree bent over the precipice that Peri and Ceci escape to their new world, fulfilling the movement towards change that is prefigured so early in the novel. Peri's part in this transformation hinges on his exceptional status in the household on the Paquequer, where he wanders virtually as he pleases, having abandoned his family and tribe for a life of voluntary servitude. If Cecilia, incarnating the Indian's vision of 'a senhora dos brancos', occupies the mythical role of Virgin as authority, consolation, and intercession, then Peri is a Christ figure of the New World, a self-sacrificing martyr and saviour. The ideal guardian of the white patriarchal community, 'urn gènio benfazejo das florestas do Brasil' (p. 97), he uses his semi-magical, almost supernatural powers to ensure Cecilia's well-being and to preserve her, and</page><page sequence="24">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISMI IN BRAZIL 79 thus the future of the community, from danger. He protects her from animals and insects, from the arrows of the hostile Aimorés and from the evil Loredano, even dreaming of a moonbeam to guard over her. His plan to foil the Aimoré attack involves poisoning his own body, so that by consuming his flesh in the ritual of cannibalism, the enemy warriors will also die. Although saved from execution by Alvaro, Peri seems bound to die from the effects of the curare which is already working in him. His mysterious journey into the forest, where a communion with Nature brings him from a death- like sleep to a miraculous revival, resembles the Resurrection of the biblical Saviour: O dia declinou: veio a tarde, depois a noite, e sob essa abobada espessa em que Peri dormia corno em um santuàrio, nem um rumor revelara o que ai se passou. Quando o primeiro reflexo do dia purpureou o horizonte, as folhas se abriram, e Peri exausto de forças, vacilante, emagrecido como se acabasse de urna longa enfermidade, saiu do seu retiro, (p. 241) His final act of salvation is to carry Cecilia away from the scene of destruction before it is annihilated in the explosion which Dom Antonio has prepared; even as the flood waters rise and threaten to engulf her, he tears a tree from its roots with superhuman strength, willing the survival of the colony's 'chosen people': 'Tu viveras!'. However, in order that this act of salvation can take place and a new society be born, a fundamental change is necessary in the relationship between the Indian and the fidalgo and his daughter, a change in the exercise of authority. From the moment when Peri agrees to remain in Cecilia's service, she becomes aware of her power as senhora and heir to her father's absolute rule: Ver aquela alma selvagem, livre como as aves que planavam no ar, ou como os rios que corriam na várzea; aquela natureza forte e vigorosa que fazia prodigios de força e coragem; aquela vontade indomá vel como a torrente que se precipita do alto da serra; prostrar-se a seus pés submissa, vencida, escrava! (pp. 106-07) The limitations of Peri's apparent freedom as a voluntary slave in the household are only exposed when there is an open conflict of wills; this occurs when Dom Antonio and his daughter forbid him to sacrifice his life in the Aimoré camp, a sacrifice which Peri knows is their only hope, forcing him to violate the normally unspoken law of obedience to his colonial masters: Cecilia ergueu-se com urn movimento instantáneo; de pé e pálida, soberba de colera e indignaçâo, a gentil e graciosa menina de outrora se tinha de repente transformado numa rainha imperiosa. . . . Atirando a cabecinha loura sobre o ombro esquerdo com um gesto de energia, eia estendeu a mäo para Peri: - Proibo-te que saias desta casa! ...(...) Peri deu um passo para a porta; D. Antonio o reteve: - Tua senhora, disse o fidalgo f riamen te, acaba de te dar urna ordern; tu a cump rirás. Tranquiliza-te, minha filha; Peri é meu prisioneiro.</page><page sequence="25">8o DAVID H. TREECE Ouvindo esta palavra que destruía todas as suas esperanças, que o impossibilitava de salvar sua senhora, o indio retraíndo-se deu um salto e caiu no meio da sala. - Peri é livre! . . . gritou eie fora de si; Peri nao obedece a ninguém mais; farà o que lhe manda o coraçâo. (pp. 207-08) Peri's predicament, his rebellion against the authority of the patriarch and their final reconciliation, as Dom Antonio knights the Indian and confides his daughter to his safe-keeping, demonstrate the necessarily precarious balance of power that must be nurtured if the community is to survive. For Peri's freedom, his identity as a marginal living in the limbo between civilization and nature, society and forest, is vital to his role as guardian of Cecilia and of the white community. He knows that in the historical reality of colonial, patriarchal Brazil, the Indian could only enter white society as a slave and by accepting its laws; as such he could not protect Cecilia: 'Se Peri fosse cristäo, e um hörnern quisesse te ofender, ele näo poderia matá-lo, porque o teu Deus manda que um hörnern näo mate outro. Peri seivagem näo respeita ninguém; quern ofenda sua senhora é seu inimigo, e morrei' (p. 163). Although he accepts his Christian title as a knight in the service of Dom Antonio, his conversion is not complete; he will only agree to respect the law of the Cross at some ideal time in the future, when Ceci, and the future of the community, are no longer in danger. There is a clear enough resemblance between this constant tension between the power and authority of the patriarch and the freedom and natural impulses of the marginal, and Alencar's political views regarding Conciliation - an effective, free opposi- tion and the moderating role of the monarch on the authoritarian excesses of government. The notion of an unspoken contract or political balance between the centre of power and its margins appears in probably the most popular novel of a writer whose work Alencar read avidly as a student, Walter Scott. Towards the end of Ivanhoe, the 'King of Outlaws', Robin Hood, who has aided Richard Coeur-de-Lion in the overthrow of his treacherous brother John, feasts his king in Sherwood Forest. However, noticing that his men are encouraged by the drink and merriment to boast of 'their successful infraction of the laws' and soon lose 'their awe for the presence of Majesty', he thinks it wise to cut short the celebration. In the words of Ivanhoe: 'And know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty even in its gayest mood, are but toying with the lion's whelp, which, on slight provocation, uses both fangs and claws.'33 If the danger of conflict between the defiant outlaws and a jealous guardian of authority is recognized by Robin Hood, Richard is no less appreciative of the value of reconciliation and the need for tolerance and generosity in government: 33 Sir Walter Scott, Ivanhoe (London, undated), p. 217.</page><page sequence="26">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 8l He once more extended his hand to Robin Hood, assured him of his full pardon and future favour, as well as his firm resolution to restrain the tyrannical exercise of the forest rights and other oppressive laws, by which so many English yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion. (Ivanhoe, p. 219) Both Robin Hood and Peri, then, need the patriarch's tolerance of their freedom and rebellion if they are to ensure the survival of the existing regime. Peri's role is even more mythical, though, for he is the agent of change, carrying the young spirit of the country to safety when its anachronistic foundations are collapsing about it. In the kiss which ends the novel, the new relationship between Peri and Ceci changes from one of brother and sister to that of man and woman; from a fraternal love, and one that therefore has no future beyond their own lives, to a sexual love capable of 'replenishing the earth' as Noah and his family do in the Old Testament myth. Recognizing herself as 'urna filha das florestas, urna verdadeira americana' (p. 267), Ceci is asserting her nationality as a Brazilian, and at the same time is defining that nationality in terms of a new set of 'natural' values. Or rather, they are traditional values based on love and self-sacrifice, renewed by the natural world; in making endless sac- rifices, dying and being resurrected, Peri is announcing a new Christianity for Brazil, an Empire in which the sins and conflicts of the colonial past have been wiped away. Alencar's novels, then, are characteristic of this second phase of the Indianist movement, turning away from the early themes of political nationalism, racial conflict, war, masculinity, and alienation, towards themes of conciliation, alliance, commercial and sexual relations, and racial integration. Thus, as O Guarani, ends with the implied 'marriage' of Indian and white senhora, Iracema concludes with the birth of the mestico child, looking not back but forwards to the evolution of contemporary Brazilian society. In their different ways, the other works of this period are concerned with explaining and rationalizing the social, economic, and political foundations of the Imperial regime. Araújo Amazonas's novel Sima, published in the same year as O Guarani, yet unrecognized until recently by students of Indianism, is concerned less with national myth and more with the nature of Amazonian society and its roots in the indigenist policies of the previous century. Felício dos Santos's Acayaca (1866) gives a fictional, semi- legendary account of the growth of diamond mining in the state of Minas Gerais, drawing an implicit contrast between the social misery of the eighteenth century, with its brutally dictatorial Crown monopoly of the industry (the curse of those Indians who were massacred at its beginning), and the peace and prosperity which followed the stormy conflicts of Independence. Tristäo de Alencar Araripe Júnior, a relative and admirer of José de Alencar, pursues the themes of alliance and mestiçagem of Indian</page><page sequence="27">82 DAVID H. TREECE and white in the short fiction of Contos Brazileiros (1868) and Jacina, a Marabú (1870). Fagundes Varela's Anchieta, ou o Evangelho ñas Selvas (1871), meanwhile, juxtaposes the biblical narrative of fall, betrayal, sacrifice, and redemption with the historical events which involved the missionary Anchieta in the early colonial conflict between Indian and white. Offering the Brazilian landscape as an alternative setting for the Old and New Testament mythologies, and the Indian tribes as the Jews of the New World, the poem elevates modern Empire as the culmination of a kind of Second Coming, the fulfilment of God's kingdom on earth. The Christian formulae of sin, sacrifice, and salvation which are central to the mythical structures of Alencar's novels, also play a fundamental role in Bernardo Guimaräes's O Ermitäo de Muquém (1858). Here, the reconciliation of individual and society is demonstrated by the case of Gonçalo, the murderer who escapes temporarily from justice into the refuge of an Indian commun- ity, where he plans to set up an alternative empire challenging the legitimate authority of the local towns. However, his guilt, isolation, and ultimate failure to become integrated into the tribe force him to return as a religious penitent, honouring the moral values of the society he attempted to reject. By virtue of this parable-like structure, O Ermitäo de Muquém falls well within the phase of conciliation Indianism which I characterized by the example of Alencar; however, as we shall now see, other elements of the novel, its 'naturalistic' rather than mythical treatment of sex and violence, and its concern with contemporary rural and indigenous life, represent a transition towards a third stage in the evolution of Indianism. III. Abolitionism, Republicanism, and Realism The works which I have just examined take us to the beginning of the 1 870s, a decade when the principal political and economic foundations of Empire were being seriously questioned. The appointment of the 1868 Itaborai Government, effectively an Imperial coup, upset the balance of power shared by Crown and Parliament; Pedro IPs support of the Free Womb bill in 1 871 divided Conservatives, creating a new radical group representing those fazendeiros who felt a threat to their independence and property rights and who, like Alencar, pointed to the economic and social chaos that would ensue. Liberal abolitionists such as Joaquim Nabuco, meanwhile, criticized the limited range of the reforms being passed and saw in the free labour market a guarantee of economic progress. Nabuco's role at this stage of the Indianist movement must be examined in more detail, since it provides a further example of the close correspondence between political ideology and cultural attitudes in nineteenth-century Brazil. The decline of Indianism might reasonably be attributed to the historical triumph of Realism over Romanticism, symbolized by the public debate between Nabuco and Alencar which occupied the Sunday and Thursday</page><page sequence="28">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 83 editions of the Rio newspaper, O Globo, for several weeks in 1875. The Indianists' mythical treatment of their theme, the recourse to early colonial images of primitive man and their elevation into an ideal symbol of Liberal and nationalist values, certainly mark the movement out as essentially Romantic in character. Moreover, it constituted an obvious target for the new schools of criticism, such as the 'escola do Recife' and the Ceará group, which emerged out of the materialist and pseudo-scientific theories of environmen- talism and Positivism, and which were applying them to the contemporary social reality of Brazil. The movement towards Abolition meant that the African was finally being admitted as a significant component of the national physiognomy, even though his servile economic status had until now denied him a place in the official literary image of Brazilian nationality. By the end of the Second Reign well over half the population was coloured, whilst the influx of European immigrants that had begun at mid-century was now intensifying, so that the Indianists' old nationalist myth of a mestiçagem of just two races, Portuguese and Indian, was no longer sustainable. Nabuco, recently returned from Europe, attacks Alencar's works from an apparently straightforward Realist standpoint, like that of the historian Joäo Francisco Lisboa, criticizing their idealization of events and situations, and their lack of verisimilitude. Peri's capture of the lynx in O Guarani, for instance, his heroic suicide and miraculous resuscitation from the poison: E um indio efeminado que deixa tudo por urna mulher, que adora: que nao tern um so dos sentimentos de sua raça; que parece aprazer-se na escravidäo, desmentindo as tradiçoes indígenas; é um seivagem de ópera cómica, em urna palavra.34 However, closer examination of some of Nabuco's remarks reveals his hostility to Alencar's Indianism to be based on more than a mere disagreement about novelistic technique and descriptive authenticity. In effect, it is based on a quite contrary view of the desired future for Brazilian culture, a future which in Nabuco's eyes should abandon the celebration of indigenist values and should acknowledge its debt to the superior white civilization of Europe: Essa literatura indígena tern certa pretensâo a tornar-se a literatura brasileira. Sem dúvida quem estuda os dialetos selvagens, a religiâo grosseira, os mitos confusos, os costumes rudes dos nossos indígenas, presta um serviço à ciencia, e mesmo à arte. O que porém é impossivel, é querer-se fazer dos selvagens a raça, de cuja civilizaçâo a nossa literatura deve ser o monumento. Nos somos brasileiros, nao somos guaranis; a lingua que f alamos, é ainda a portuguesa. Com o tempo, com a influencia lenta, mas poderosa, do meio exterior, há de se tornar cada vez mais sensível a divergencia que já começa de manifestar-se entre a nossa literatura e a de Portugal. (A Polémica, p. 1 80) Afrânio Coutinho, who has brought together the material of the Alencar- Nabuco debate, rightly reassesses the roles of the two figures, not in terms of 34 A Polèmica Alencar-Nabuco, edited by Afrânio Coutinho (Rio de Janeiro, 1965), p. 90.</page><page sequence="29">84 DAVID H. TREECE the Romanticism- Realism conflict, but as representative of two philo- sophies of Brazilian civilization: one brasilista current which, though not ignoring its European inheritance, addresses a new and peculiarly Brazilian reality born from the fusion of various racial, cultural, social, linguistic, literary, and historical elements; the other, ocidentalista perspective expressing a continued loyalty to and faith in the country's European roots, promoting the interests of the traditionally dominant class of white Portuguese. {A Polèmica, pp. 7-8). Nabuco's 'ocidentalismo', his rejection of indigenist, nativista values, is not limited to the sphere of art and literature. As Carlos Moreira has noted, it may be of some surprise to learn that Nabuco, one of the most active Liberal leaders in the campaign for Abolition, was also the author of an official government document prescribing Indian policy for the first years of the Republic, a policy whose language and ideas are unmistakably based on those of Varnhagen, the apologist of extermination half a century earlier.35 In a border dispute with Britain over its Guyanese colony, European public opinion was largely influenced by British propaganda regarding Brazilian cruelty and forced labour amongst the Indians of the Upper Negro and Branco rivers. Nabuco, in his 'Exposiçâo Final' as Brazil's special envoy in the negotiations, defended his country's policy with the argument that, under Portuguese law, the Indian was not recognized as having any political sovereignty; as a result, he could possess no legal title to the land he occupied and no right to transfer such a title to the colonizing nation. Imperial documents dating from the middle of the century were cited to reaffirm this lack of political status and the consequent freedom of the colonial power in disposing of the territories and their inhabitants: II ne s'agit pas d'Indiens indépendants, mais du droit sur le territoire. Ces hordes errantes ne constituent pas des nations souveraines et indépendantes selon le droit des gens. Elles sont sujettes à la jurisdiction et à l'autorité des nations civilisées et des gouvernments réguliers et reconnus, auxquels appartient le territoire occupé par lesdites hordes. ('A Política Indigenista', p. xvii) Another important contributor to the debate on Indian policy and to the evolution of the literature on Indians was General José Vieira Couto de Magalhäes, the polymath, traveller and politician and author of O Sel- vagem. As a relatively young man, Couto de Magalhäes occupied the Presidencies of the Provinces of Goiás, Para, and Mato Grosso, where he knew the novelist Bernardo Guimaräes; but, as a loyal Monarchist, he renounced his office as President of Säo Paulo when the Republic was proclaimed, even suffering imprisonment under Floriano Peixoto. The linguistic and ethnographic work, O Selvagem, was the fruit of various expeditions to the river Araguaia, in Mato Grosso, and was presented in 35 Carlos de Araújo Moreira Neto, 'A Política Indigenista Brasileira durante o Século xix', p. xiv.</page><page sequence="30">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 85 1 874 to the Instituto Histórico as well as figuring in the Universal Exhibition organized by the United States in Philadelphia, before being published in 1876. It was also an important source for writers during the First Republic and in the Modernist Movement. Aside from its first-hand account of Tupi culture, its zoological myths and course in the Tupi language, which left their mark on the final period of nineteenth-century Indianism, O Selvagem includes some important state- ments regarding the question of economic development of the interior and the role to be played by indigenous and immigrant labour. As the following extract from 'A selvagem como elemento economico' will show, Couto de Magalhäes espoused an intermediate view which recognized both the value of imported labour and of the existing human resource of the native populations, with their knowledge of the ecology of the rain-forest: Povoar o Brasil quer dizer: (1) Importar colonos da Europa para cultivar as terras já desbravadas nos centros, ou próximos aos centros povoados. (2) Aproveitar para a populaçao nacional as terras ainda virgens, onde o selvagem é um obstáculo; estas terras representam quase dois tercos do territorio do Imperio. Tornar produtiva urna populaçao, hoje improdutiva, é pelo menos, täo importante como trazer novos bracos. (3) Utilizar cerca de um milhäo de selvagens que possuímos, os quais sâo os que melhores serviços podem prestar nessas duas tercas partes do nosso territorio, porque as industrias extrativas, únicas possíveis nessas regiöes (enquanto nao houver estradas), so tem sido e só podem ser exploradas pelo selvagem.36 Indianist writing during the last two decades of Empire (1872-88) is of two kinds: one group which takes account of these changing perceptions of the racial and social reality of the Brazilian rural interior, and which therefore moves away from the traditional heroic mode of the Romantics towards a more 'Realist' position; and a second group which seeks to continue or revive the classic Indianism of Gonçalves Dias but which, in the light of the literary and ideological changes which have meanwhile taken place, necessarily fails in the attempt. As I have suggested, Bernardo Guimaráes's O Ermitäo de Muquém (1858) already marks a tendency towards the first of these two develop- ments in its questioning of the mythical level of narrative and in its portrayal of contemporary rural society. Guimaräes possessed a radical, independent streak even as a youth, when he reputedly ran away from school in Ouro Preto to join the 1842 Minas and Säo Paulo Liberal revolution. His unorthodox views during his legal and administrative career in Goiás led him to quarrel with the President of the Province and with the juiz de diretto of the district, and on one occasion he freed the prisoners at a trial, allegedly 36 General Couto de Magalhàes, O Selvagem (Belo Horizonte, 1975), pp. 22-23.</page><page sequence="31">86 DAVID H. TREECE out of compassion. This attitude of dissension extended into his literary activities on the Rio newspaper, Atualidade, where, according to one biographer, 'mete a lenha com vontade em Junqueira Freiré e Joaquim Manuel de Macedo', two eminent representatives of Brazilian Romanticism.37 As an examination of O Indio Afonso and the satirical poem 'Elixir do Page' will show, Guimaräes's critical nature led him finally to reject the mythical, idealized Indianismi of O Guarani and Iracema, and to explore a more worldly landscape inhabited by real human beings. O Indio Afonso first appeared in a serialized form in the newspaper A Reforma in January 1872. Its protagonist is a new kind of Indianist hero, both in terms of his human, spiritual stature and by virtue of his relation to the dominant moral values and laws of white society. A modern, detribalized Indian or caboclo, he lives with his sister Caluta, her husband and children, providing them with food through his skill as a cattle rustler. While the men are away from home one day, Toruna, a local bandit, attacks and attempts to rape Caluta, apparently causing her to commit suicide by jumping into the torrent of a river. Caluta later reappears, having swum to safety, but her two young sons have meanwhile told Afonso of the occurrence, and he sets about avenging his sister. Tracking Toruna down, he castrates and mutilates him, cutting off his lips, nose and ears; but despite being repeatedly pursued and several times captured by the agents of the law, he always defies them, escaping into the refuge of the forest or the waters of the river which seem to protect him and transform him into a local legend. As the text progresses, a shift in taste, from the earlier Romantic Indianists' sentimentalism to his own brutal sensationalism, is increasingly detectable, as is the move away from the noble, epic motives of Alencar's characters to the more material desires and ambitions of those of Guimaräes. Thus, while Afonso is still the physical superman whose skill and courage surpass that of twenty ordinary men, he is no longer an aristocratic tribal chief, but one of 'esta raça de indios mestiços que vivem vida nomade e semibárbara pelas margens dos grandes rios do sertâo, subsistindo quase exclusivamente de caça e pesca' . 38 Similarly, his punishment of Toruna forms an ironic contrast to the Herculean struggles which take place between the Indian warriors of Romantic narratives from Gonçalves Dias onwards. Afonso jumps onto the shoulders of Toruna, who is crouching at a stream, and forces his face into the mud; he drags him out and ties him to a branch of a tree, forcing him to beg pitiably for mercy, and to invoke the five wounds of Christ. In response, Afonso then performs what the narrator describes with unsparingly graphic details as 'a bárbara vingança', making his five amputations in utterly cold blood. 37 Antonio de Alcántara Machado, *O Fabuloso Bernardo Guimaräes', in Cavaquinho e Saxafone (Solos), 1926-193 s (Rio de Janeiro, 1940), p. 224. 38 Bernardo Guimaräes, O Indio Afonso, Quatro Romances (bao Paulo, 1944), p. 366.</page><page sequence="32">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 87 But if the descriptive level of the narrative has been brought down from an epic, heroic register to one of physical sensationalism, a mythical element remains, and that is Afonso's eternal defiance of the law. Having first fled from the area with his family, he then becomes homesick, above all for his river; it is the magical relationship with the river which justifies his perma- nent rebellion and freedom: Estou aflito por lavar o meu corpo n'água do Parnaíba; é là so que eu sou gente. O maioral de Goiaz já há de ter esquecido de mim; e também, estando eu na beirada do meu rio, quem é capaz de me botar a mäo? Eu caindo ñas aguas do Parnaíba, voces bem sabem, é o mesmo que cair nos braços de meu pai, ou de minha mâe. (p. 387) And just as he says, the Parnaíba protects him as a son. During one arrest he is handcuffed to two soldiers and, as he is taken on board a makeshift trimaran, he blesses himself with the water of the river. A storm breaks and a huge tree-trunk is thrust against the boat, distracting his captors and enabling him to drift away into freedom, like 'o genio do rio sobre o seu trono flutuante, governando com o gesto e com o olhar as révoltas e turbulentas ondas' (p. 391). The final pages of the story offer an interpretation of the character and actions of the Indian Afonso which would not have been possible in the traditional Indianist novel, where the Indian is either a loyal defender of the white code of morals and justice, or a savage rebel alien to the social pact. Guimaräes's view of the Indian marginal is an important advance, a rejection of the Romantics' compulsion to transform the tribal primitive into a citizen of their own society, an upholder of their own philosophical and political values. Guimaräes's story abandons that simplistic stereotype, combining a character capable of acts of the cruellest violence with one who demonstrates loyalty, tenderness, and even religious respect. Narrating from within the world of the caboclo rather than from outside it, Guimaräes depicts a physical and moral environment that is isolated from the civil institutions and laws of white society, a world where such institutions have no place in the direct relationship of man and nature, where natural justice prevails and the freedom of the marginal is respected. Just as the local farmers tolerate Afonso's cattle-rustling activities as the normal order of the sertäo, so the police of Goiás eventually give up their pursuit of Afonso, recognizing the inappropriateness of 'a justiça social' in judging crimes of passion and brotherly devotion. It is a view which must have appealed to the author's unorthodox sense of legal and political responsibility, which seems to have made his career in the rural interior of Goiás such an interesting one. It also leads one to question the judgement of Nelson Werneck Sodré and Afrânio Coutinho,39 for whom Guimaräes's is a Romantic regionalism, 39 Nelson Werneck Sodré, Historia da Literatura Brasileira: Seus Fundamentos Económicos, fifth edition (Rio de Janeiro, 1969), pp. 403-04, quoting Afrânio Coutinho, A Literatura no Brasil, 5 vols (Rio de Janeiro, 1955), 11, 145-46.</page><page sequence="33">88 DAVID H. TREECE idealizing and artificializing the picturesque qualities of local life, 'ao mesmo tempo que procurava encobri-lo, atribuindo-lhe qualidades, sentimentos, valores que näo lhe pertencem, mas à cultura que se lhe sobrepöe'. For Guimaräes's departure from the traditional portrayal of rural culture lies precisely in his insistence on seeing the social life and problems of the rural interior as something fundamentally 'different', to which the morality and values of urban, bourgeois society cannot sensibly be applied: Os leitores teräo depreendido desta minha veridica historia que o indio Afonso näo é um facínora, mas sim um hörnern de bem, cheio de belas qualidades e sentimentos generosos, porém vivendo quase no estado natural no seio das florestas, em luta a urn tempo com os bandidos e facínoras que o rodeiam, com a natureza selvática e as feras do sertäo, e com a polícia que o persegue. É essa vida rude e agitada que lhe tem desenvolvido a um ponto extraordinario a astucia, a valentía e a robustez próprias de sua natureza. Naqueles desertos, no fundo daquelas ¿mensas florestas, onde a açao da justiça social é quase nula, o hörnern, por mais inofensiva que seja a súa índole, vê-se muitas vezes forçado a defender-se contra seus semelhantes, corno quem se defende das onças e das serpentes. (O Ìndio Afonso, p. 402) If Bernardo Guimaräes's Indianist fiction, especially Jupira and O Ìndio Afonso, represents an increasing aversion for certain of the Romantics' myths and their epic mood, then the poem 'Elixir do Page' is an outright satire on the movement in its traditional form. I referred earlier to Guimaräes's attacks on the Romantics Junqueira Freiré and Macedo in the paper Atualidade. In his 'Esboço Biográfico' of Gonçalves Dias,40 Manuel Bandeira notes that in the same publication Guimaräes also wrote a series of articles criticizing the poet's unfinished epic, Os Timbiras, which had only recently received the praise of Macedo, Francisco Otaviano, and Franklin Távora. Basilio de Magalhäes has suggested that the pentasyllabic stanzas of 'Elixir do Page' are a parody of sections of Os Timbiras. Whether this is the case or whether, as seems more likely, the parody in fact concerns the poem 'O Canto do Guerreiro', Guimaräes's text taken as a whole is certainly an uncompromising satire of the kind of heroic Indianism for which Gonçalves Dias was best known. Moving on from the sensationalist sex and violence of Jupira and O Ìndio Afonso to a theme of explicit obscenity, the poem evidently struck a chord with the public, suggesting that the plausibility of the traditional Indianism was on its last legs. According to Artur Azevedo, the only contemporary to have condemned Bernardo Guimaräes's obscene poetry, 'Elixir do Page' was the most popular of his poems, despite not having an official printing, much to the publisher Garnier's despair: 'E raro 0 mineiro que o näo saiba de cor. Há na provincia espalhados um sem número de copias desse [poema] inútil e brejeiro'; despite censorship there were apparently several clandestine printings after the first edition of 7 May 1875.41 40 In Poesia e Prosa, 11, 73 1. 41 Basilio de Magalhäes, Bernardo Guimaräes {Esboço Btographtco e Critico) (Rio de Janeiro, 1926), p. 113.</page><page sequence="34">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 89 The poem recounts the mythical, Indianist origin of an elixir renowned as a cure for male impotence; the speaker addresses his unresponsive, flaccid organ and laments its decline, with appropriately colourful imagery and anthropomorphic metaphors. Hope is not lost, though, because he has obtained a miracle remedy, concocted from magical herbs in a distant land by an Indian medicine-man who suffered from the same complaint. At this point the initial decasyllables of the poem turn to pentasyllables as the narrator describes the prodigious return of the page's sexual proficiency and vigour. As a comparison with stanzas of Gonçalves Dias's 'O Canto do Guerreiro' will show, Guimaräes uses both the rhythm and even the syntactic structures of the other poet in a sexual parody of the Indianist martial theme: Dias, 'O Canto do Guerreiro' Guimaräes, 'Elixir do Page' Valente na guerra 'Mas neste traballio, Quern há, como eu sou? dizei, minha gente, Quem vibra o tacape quem é mais valente, Com mais valentia? mais forte quemé?

My thanks to Professor Plinio Doyle, of Rio de Janeiro, for kindly allowing me to consult his copies of this and other editions of the poem.</page><page sequence="35">9O DAVID H. TREECE (i 872). Jupira is another example of the mestica, Gonçalves Dias's Marabá, Teixeira e Sousa's Miry'ba, or Alencar's Isabel, whose mixed blood causes her tragic maladjustment to both the societies which brought her into being. Guimaräes's heroine is exceptional to the Indianist movement, however, in actually avenging her mistreatment by both Indian and white society through acts of murder, rather than suffering her fate as a passive victim. In contrast to O Ermitäo de Muquém, then, the problem of the protagonist's social maladjustment is not resolved by a reconciliation, but instead leads only to further disruption and death. The uncompromising passion that is typical of the early Romantic Indianist heroes has ceased to be turned to the service of the white community. Instead, it has become a destructive, consuming force, alien to any notion of social conformity or political order. The theme of social alienation is one of those explored in the Americanas (1875) of Machado de Assis, the second of three books of poetry written before the phase of the great novelistic masterpieces. Although remaining faithful to the conventions and style of the classic Indianist texts, the Americanas acknowledge more recent accounts of Indian culture than simply those of the cronistas-, they use these new perceptions of tribal man to portray a world that is a reflection of white society, examining notions of alienation, sexual weariness, infidelity, and jealousy in the context of Christian morality. Besides a reference, in the poem 'Lua Nova', to Couto de Magalhäes's O Selvagem, there is a more extensive mention of an academic source in 'Niâni'. That is, the Historia Dos indios Cavaleiros ou da Nacäo Guaicurú, written in 1795 by the soldier Francisco Rodrigues do Prado and published in 1 8 3 9 in the first edition of the Revista do Instituto Histórico. As well as its description of the Indians' monogamous marriage system and simple divorce procedure, the book gives an account of their social hierarchy which, though obviously suspect in its use of European and Brazilian notions of class, offers an alternative basis for an Indianist text, like Machado's, that seeks to fictionalize the social relationships of the white community: A naçâo guaicurú se divide em très partes: a primeira é a dos nobres, a que chamam de capitäes, e as mulheres destes, conas, título que também têm as filhas; a outra chamam soldados, que obedecem de pais a filhos; e a terceira, que é mais considerável, é a dos cativos, que assim chamam a todos aqueles que apanham na guerra e a seus descendentes, aos quais tratam com muito amor, sem os obrigar a fazer trabalho algum. Há, porém, a circunstancia de reputar-se vileza casar com escravo, a ponto de que o filho despreza a mäe que casou com escravo.43 This description must have appealed to Machado's conception of Imperial society as composed of aristocracy, 'soldiers', and slaves, for 'Niâni' is essentially about class discrimination and its interference in 43 General Raúl Silveira de Mello, Para Além dos Bandeirantes (Rio de Janeiro, 1968), p. 122.</page><page sequence="36">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 91 personal life. It is based on Rodrigues do Prado's story of the lovers Panenioxe and Nanine, whose fathers are both capitäes, or Guaicurú chiefs. Despite all her protests, Panenioxe deserts Nanine and marries 'urna rapa- riga de menor esfera'; before dying of grief, Nanine avenges the insult by freeing a cativo on condition that he takes her former lover's name, so leaving a permanent and humiliating reminder of his act of betrayal, identifying him with the lowest element of the social hierarchy. Machado emphasizes the element of class, first in his reference to the couple's aristocratic status - 'Moca é de nobre feiçao', 'Limpo sangue tern o noivo/ Que é filho de capitäo',44 and in the contrasting status of Panenioxe's second wife: 'Noiva näo é de alto sangue,/Porém de sangue vulgar' (p. 109). A note to the text (noteP, p. 183) makes it quite clear that the analogy between the semi-fictional tribal world of the Guaicurús and the urban Brazilian society of 'nobres, plebeus, cativos' is a consciously formulated one; as Machado suggests elsewhere in the poem, the problems of human relationships in the 'florestas' differ little from those of the universal tales of 'além-mar, de moças e de princesas'. Despite his overt resistance to the new Realist influences during the debate with Nabuco, Alencar was evidently not immune to this concern with ethnographical authenticity in the search for parallels between the pre- colonial and colonial eras and contemporary Brazilian society. The text of his last Indianist novel, Ubirajara (1874), is supplemented by copious notes verifying the accuracy and authenticity of its descriptive details. The same concern is also an important feature of Os Escravos Vermelhos, although here it is prompted by a more specific and immediate issue, that of Abolition. The first of three parts of a collection entitled Patria Selvagem, by the abolitionist poet and journalist, José de Melo Moráis Filho, Os Escravos Vermelhos is undated but was probably written between 1882 and the early 1900S. Its historical subject is once again the sixteenth-century war against the French and the Tamoio confederation, which provided the material for Gonçalves de Magalhäes's epic poem. In Melo Moráis Filho's version, however, the traditional foundation myth of Empire is revised in order to accommodate the forgotten facts of Indian slavery, and therefore to high- light the question of contemporary black slavery. While there is a continual, ironic contrast in the narrative between the colonial reality of slavery and the normal daily existence of the tribes, the latter is not treated over- sympathetically or idealized in the Romantic manner. On the contrary, Melo Moráis Filho deliberately chooses to describe those customs which are repugnant to white society, accentuating the cultural rift by which the colonial and Imperial regimes justified their marginalization and exploita- 44 J. M. Machado de Assis, Obra Completa, in (Rio de Janeiro: José Aguilar, 1973), pp. 108 and 109. 4</page><page sequence="37">92 DAVID H. TREECE tion of the coloured races. The war ritual, for example, an infernal 'sabbath americano5, or the act of cannibalism: No cráneo fracturado o indio acolha os labios e sorve o cerebro ... os magarefes perfuram o hepigastro, e os meninos, mettendo a mäo até o hombro, retiram-n'a com os intestinos, que tostam ao rescaldo e comem, pulando e correndo.45 The text is not fiction as such, rather a half-lyrical, half-documentary essay which, by drawing attention to the institutionalized crimes of the past, seeks to denounce those of the present. In the opening dedication, the author overtly identifies the two causes of Indian and black slavery, looking forward to a more enlightened age in which Abolition will have redeemed Brazil from its spiritual tomb: Debaixo d'este solo repousam duas raças escravisadas. Arreando o flanco ensanguentado na arena do captiveiro, duas feras ainda se saciam no cadáver do indio e do negro. A Patria, na corrupçâo que embriaga, assiste a esse espectáculo de amphitheatro romano; e emquañto o rei tripudia, ella se esquece de seus maiores homens. Um dia, porém, tu erguerás com o braco a pedra do teu sepulchro e derreterás a noite que se tern feito em torno de teu nome. (p. i) In contrast to the sociological emphasis of these last three authors and the evidence of Realist influences present in their Indianist works, Luis Delfino dos Santos's A Epopéia Americana (1865-75) reverts to the epic, mythical level of Gonçalves Dias's poetry. Considered by the Parnassianists in 1885 to be 'O maior poeta do Brasil', Delfino dos Santos was another abolitionist poet, who played host to the rising literary generations of his time, including the Symbolists, but who sank from popularity himself shortly after his death in 19 10. Unearthed in recent years by David Haberly, only a fragment of A Epopéia Americana survives, one hundred and twenty-seven stanzas which are interrupted by what is effectively an admission of a loss of faith in the Indianist illusion: Agora morre, agora lento e lento A negra noite horrendo a mente avança, E da descrença o formidável espectro A alma me assalta, e me espedaça o plectro.46 The narrative which leads up to this crisis of faith recounts the drowning of an Indian girl in the tidal wave of the pororoca, and her funeral. Central to the poem's perspective on this episode is the role of the Old Man who watches the disaster and then intervenes to gather up the body from the river. His mission and, it becomes clear, that of the poet, is to 'Chorar na cova de urna raça inteira', to mourn the death of the Indian people, record its 45 Melo Moráis Filho, Os Escravos Vermelhos (Rio de Janeiro, undated), p. 26. 46 David T. Haberly, 'Urna Desconhecida Epopéia Indianista , Revista do Instituto de tstudos Brasileños, 12 (Sâo Paulo, 1972), 107.</page><page sequence="38">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 93 history and thereby redeem it from oblivion, guaranteeing its memory for the future. Faced with the spectacle of an irremediable catastrophe that is symbolized by the death of the india, he cannot deny the truth and rewrite history, only attempt to transcend it by celebrating the lost race in a work of art. However, the Old Man also reveals the other aspect of the artist's dual nature: if, on the one hand, he is necessarily detached from the historical process, he is also, as a mortal human being, inevitably involved in it. After witnessing the girl's death, the Old Man becomes sexually fascinated by the dead body, in a long and detailed erotic description that could well have been inspired by Victor Meirelles de Lima's painting of Moema (1866), the tragic, drowned figure of Duräo's Caramurú: Entre a separaçao de peito a peito, Là onde os dois irmäos estavam rindo, E como inda ririam com efeito, Pois era cada seio o sol mais lindo, Como na fulva areia de áureo leito Finos cábelos negros reluzindo, Traçaram sulco, como a luz de um facho; E iam crescendo mais a mais a baixo. (p.90) Filled with 'saltos de tigres em braveza', he undergoes an inner struggle between the forces of instinct and reason as he is tempted to possess her, before his consciousness of this involvement in the process of time and human mortality allows him to resume his role as 4O Esquilo do drama'. The entire tribe then takes up the song of mourning that has been intoned by a young warrior's rage of grief; the poem protests too against the meaningless- ness of the girl's death - 'Tudo acabará entäo? Já näo havia/ Amigos e inimigos sobre a terra?' (p. 103). The deaths of individuals undermine the organized world of human relationships, while the death of a race, the genocide of the Indians, blots out that world in its entirety. In echoing the sentiment of despair, the poet declares his inability to sustain any longer the illusion that forty years of Indianist literature have sustained: the survival, in myth, of a people that has long since been annihilated. While Felício dos Santos was questioning the artistic viability of the Indianist theme, Joaquim de Sousândrade was challenging the dominant aesthetic canons of his day and producing a literature which stands out from that of his contemporaries by its modern, even Modernist appearance. It was on the basis of its linguistic and stylistic interest that his work, especially the long poem, O Guesa, underwent an academic revival after its rediscovery in the 1960s by the concretista critics, Augusto and Haroldo de Campos. Although O Guesa cannot be considered an Indianist work in the usual sense, since its central theme or concern is not the Indian, it is structured by an indigenous myth and contains statements on the Indian problem. In view</page><page sequence="39">94 DAVID H. TREECE of the linguistic bias of the new criticism of the poem, it therefore still needs to be situated within the history of nineteenth-century literature and the Indianist tradition. An admirer of his fellow maranhense, Gonçalves Dias, Sousândrade was also a dedicated Republican and abolitionist who travelled widely in Latin America and spent several years as a journalist in New York. It was Sousândrade's concern with broadly American themes which doubtless led him to choose a myth derived from the culture of the Muyscas, one of the former races of Colombia, as the structure of the poem. It is a myth of human sacrifice, in which the guesa, a 'wanderer' or 'exile', is raised from childhood in the temple until his coming of age, when he is taken along the divine path, or suna, towards his death.47 The narrator or poet often merges with the character of this sacrificial victim during the course of the poem, identifying in him his personal experience of physical exile and ideological isolation as a political dissident in Imperial Brazil. The guesa's journey leads him to a privileged understanding of the American reality which is at once enlighten- ing and painful, making him excessively conscious of the suffering and corruption of contemporary capitalist society. Throughout his historical and geographical journey over the continent in thirteen cantos, Sousândrade sets this modern reality against an ideal golden age, the lost Eden of Brazil's indigenous pre-history. In the second Canto, he enters an Indian festa and witnesses the sad corruption of the tribal communities. This episode, known as the Tatuturema, and the later 'Inferno de Wall Street' of Canto x, constitute the principal examples of the poem's stylistic originality, recalling the more satirical poems of Gregorio de Matos's work, that of Oswald de Andrade, or the 'stream of consciousness' writing of the European Modernists. It is an orgy of mythical and historical figures which subverts the conventional interpretation of Brazilian history as a coherent succession of heroic achievements culminating in the Second Reign of Pedro II. Before the logical order of discourse dissolves completely into the irrational métonymie associations of the poem's more opaque passages, the Indians give their own account of colonial history. MUXURANA histórica: - Os primeiros fizeram As escravas de nos; Nossas filhas roubavam, Logravam E vendiam após.48 This exploitation and corruption of the Indian, and the decadence it produced, are symbolic of Sousândrade's Rousseauian view of modern 47 See Alexandre de Humboldt, Vues des cordillères et Monumens [sic] des peuples indigènes de l'Amérique, 2 vols (Paris, 18 16), 11, 255-58. 48 Joaquim de Sousândrade, O Guesa (Sâo Luis, 1979), p. 25.</page><page sequence="40">NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDIANISM IN BRAZIL 95 American society, even in the United States, whence his Republican beliefs took much of their political inspiration. As all hopes of rediscovering the lost Eden are progressively disillusioned by the urban societies he encounters, it gradually recedes into an inaccessible location: Além da Serra, E nos seios azues da natureza, Nas chammas dos volcóes, do Sul nos grandes Mares, ao occidente, além dos Andes, Que irá na gloria descansar o Guesa! (p. 208) Sousândrade's Republican ideal is thus preserved from the pessimism of his experience of the world, guaranteeing its mythical intactness in the heights of Gonçalves Dias's Andes, 'Onde os fortes revivem'. The poem revives the classic Indianist theme of exile in a new rejection of the dominant morality and political order of its day; it is a final, ambitious attempt to resuscitate the Romantic, Rousseauian belief in a natural model of human morality and social organization, and to combine this with a satirical critique of the capitalist economies of the New .World. Anachronistic in two senses, then, in its stylistic Modernism and its mythical Romanticism, O Guesa is an unwieldy hybrid, both too early and too late for the anti-heroic Naturalism and social Realism that was signalled by O Indio Afonso and 'Elixir do Page'.
