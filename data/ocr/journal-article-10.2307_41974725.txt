<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTORICAL NOTES CONCERNING TEN OF THE THIRTY-ONE RIGORISTIC PROPOSITIONS CONDEMNED BY ALEXANDER VIII (1690) INTRODUCTION The rigoristic decree of propositions,1 the Holy Office is closely of December linked 7, with 1690 that condemning of March 31 rigoristic propositions,1 is closely linked with that of March 4, 1679, 2 which condemned 65 lax propositions, although the two decrees are eleven years apart. While the ealier one represents the victory of the jansenists, the later is the fruit of intense anti-jansenistic activity. Since the external history of these two decrees has already been amply treated, we will give only a few necessary remarks of information.3 The University of Lou vain, which was considered a center of Jan- senism, in April, 16 77 sent to Rome a delegation composed of three members in order to defend the doctrine of the University against accusations of jansenism, and to attack its adversaries.4 This delegation, 1 D ENZIN GER, Enchiridion symbolorum, n. 1291 - 1321. 2 Ibidem, n. 1151 - 1216. 3 Cfr.

PERA which had been favorably received by Innocent XI, was endeavoring to obtain the condemnation of lax propositions attributed to the anti- jansenists. While the delegation was successfully accomplishing its mission in Rome, the anti- jansenist s did not remain idle. They organized into a "secret society" which embraced members of the three religious orders, namely, Jesuits, Franciscans and discalced Carmelites.5 The society was placed under the nominal head of the secular Nicholas Du Bois, a zealous anti-jansenist.6 In the beginning of 1679 "society' ' sent to its agent at Rome, Fr. Francis Porter of the Irish Franciscan Province, a list of 238 jan- senistic propositions. It was the duty of this Irish Friar to work for the condemnation of these jansenistic propositions. Several months later, however, the decree censuring 65 lax propositions was published on May 2, 1679. Porter's list of 238, which in the meantime had been reduced to 105, was presented to the Holy Office on July 12, 1679. The source of each proposition and a brief commentary were presented in marginal notes.7 The &lt; secret society &gt; became very impatient in not obtaining im- mediate results. Thus, to further its cause by winning the support of the King of Spain, this anti-jansenistic group commissioned another Irish Franciscan, Patrick Duffy.8 For almost a year, that is, from June 12, 1680 till May 3/4, 1681, Duffy remained at the royal Court in Madrid and together with the Spanish theologians prepared a list of jansenistic 99 - 136; also in Jansenística, I, 167 - 253; IDEM, Documents relatifs à la seconde députation janséniste de Louvain à Rome durant les années i6yy - 1679, in Bulletin de l'Institut historique belge de Rome, 30 (1957) *87 - 213.

Although he had presented a list of 356 propositions, the number was reduced to 96. 9 Thoroughly disappointed at this reduction, Duffy secretly made arrangements to still have printed a longer list. This unofficial list was entitled Theologia Baio-ianseniana and contained almost 500 propositions. Duffy left for the Eternal City as the represen- tative of the Spanish King.10 After arriving in Rome various difficulties arose between Duffy and Porter, his confrere. The former, supported by the "secret society' ' asked for priority of the royal cause, insisting that his list be examined by the Holy Office in preference to that of Porter. On the other hand, however, Porter, backed by members of the Holy Office, wished to continue the cause of his 105 propositions, which was already under way. As a result, the relations between the two Irish Franciscans was not a happy one. In the meantime the cause of Porter progressed. Four qualificators, namely, Raymond Capizucchi, O.P., Master of the Sacred Palace, Dominic Mary Pozzobonelli, O.P., Commissary of the Holy Office,11 Lawrence Brancati di Laurea, Conventual, soon to be created a cardinal,12 and Michael Angelus Ricci, secular priest before long a cardinal,13 began the examination of the list of 105 propositions.

PERA of these men to see if the propositions were actually found in the sources indicated. After the investigation they qualified many as "non habetur apud auctorem".14 Accordingly, before September 1681 the number of propositions had been reduced from 105 to 32. 16 Now that the work of establishing the authenticity had been completed, Innocent XI appointed a commission of eight theologians to determine the doctrinal import of the 32. Those selected for this task were the following: Thomas Mazza, O.P., Commissary of the Holy Office,16 Dominic Mary Pozzo- bonelli, O.P., who in the meantime had become Master of the Sacred Palace,17 Julius Mary Bianchi, O.P., later Secretary of the Congregation of the Index,18 Dominic of the Holy Trinity, a Frenchman and ex- general of the Discalced Carmelites,19 Alexander Maderno, praepositus general of the Barnabites,20 Lawrence Fabri, Conventual, consultor of the Holy Office,21 Joseph Sabbatini, Italian and member of the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine,22 Artieda Martin de Esparza, a Spanish Jesuit.23 The examination began in January 1682 and was completed in March of the following year. The propositions then passed to the hands of the Cardinals of the Holy Office to be examined in the last instance.24 On December 2, 1684 Porter announced that finally after five years of hard work his 32 propositions were censured by the Car- dinals.25 The list, however, was reduced to 3126 and only on December 7, 1690 was the decree of condemnation published under Alexander VIII.27 14 H.

VIII 23 In our treatment of this material we have proceeded in the following manner. Under each proposition we consider first, the source of the proposition ; secondly, the examination of the text ; thirdly, the doctrinal judgments; and finally, we proffer our conclusion. Under our first division, we indicate the source of the proposition as related by Porter in his lists of 238 and 105 propositions, and by Duffy in his Theologia Baio-ianseniand ; we give also some general information on the author and the work from which the particular proposition has been taken. After presenting in the second division the words of the text, we pass to the third point, namely, the doctrinal judgments, as stated by Porter, the anti-jansenists, the Theological Faculty of the University of Louvain, the theologians of the Holy Office and various commentators on the decree of condemnation. As we have already mentioned, Porter's remarks are found in his list of 105 in marginal notes next to each proposition.28 That which we refer to as the judgment of the anti-jansenists has been taken from ms. 1343 Fondo Gesuitico in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Rome. The title of this document is: Propositiones 105 Apostolicae Sedi exhibitae de- finitionibus Ecclesiae et Sanctorum Patrum sententiis demonstrantur contrariae. No author is given. Perhaps this document is a longer commen- tary written by Porter himself. Besides the opinions of Porter and the other anti-jansenists, there is preserved a statement from the Theological Faculty of Louvain. In June 1681 Cardinal Cibo, the Secretary of State, had sent the 96 prop- ositions of Duffy to Louvain and asked for a reply to the accusations.29 The answer of the University is likewise contained in nls 1343, Fondo Gesuitico of the Biblioteca Nazionale of Rome under the title: Iudicium facultatis theologicae Lovaniensis super ç6 propositionibus hie iniunctis. Since the theological faculty comments only on the 96 propositions of Duffy, we are not able to present its judgments but for those propositions which are found in the lists of both Duffy and Porter. With regard to some of the 31 propositions there is preserved a résumé of the opinions of the eight theologians of the Holy Office ap- pointed by Innocent XI to pass judgment on the doctrinal import of 28 In the letter of Porter to Ignatius Diertins, rector of the College of Louvain, dated January 9, 1683, one reads: "cum (propositiones), ut iacent in meo catalogo, sint collectae cum suis auctoribus et habent notas marginales, quae ostendunt earum coincidentiam cum doctrinis olim proscriptis, quod multum iuvat theologos, et catalogus P.

Ó99r-702v, was written later by the Spanish Franciscan, Francis Diaz.31 Of the eight theologians there likewise exists a more detailed com- mentary of Sabbatini. In his official report which is found in Rome at the Bibliotheca Angelica, ms. 899, foi. 249r-25ór, this Augustinián writes: Ex centum et quinqué propositionibus quas P. Porterus detulit ad Sedem Apostolicam censurandas, 32 olim selectae fuerunt per Rev. mos Qualificatores ad hoc negotium deputatos . . .

Itaque omissis propositionibus illis quae auctore carent aut thesi, de caeteris bre- viter ac sincere dicam quid sentio. Sabbatini comments on only 15 propositions among which is: "Spes caritate destituta virtutis theologicae rationem amittit", which was not included in the decree of condemnation. Of the remaining there are three of which he reports, "non habetur thesis," while of the others he uses expressions such as, "non est apud auctorem."32 Under our division entitled doctrinal judgments, we refer in the last place to the three commentaries written shortly after the decree of condemnation, namely, those of Dominic Viva, S.J.33 who wrote: Damnatae theses ob Alexandro VII , Innocentio XI et Alexandro VIII necnon Jansenii ad theólogicam trutinam revocatae . . ., which first ap- peared in Naples in 1708; then, the work of Martin Steyaert34: Novitas 30 This document is without doubt the one of which Porter speaks in a letter dated November 27, 1683: "quas (censuras) penes me habeo per viam secretissimam a me obtentas, acres quidem, quarum nonnullae sortiuntur hanc qualificationem : erronea , temeraria , haeretica, haeresim sapiens, iniuriosa Christo , derogans divinae pietati, scandalosa etc. cfr.

He played an important role in obtaining the condemnation of the 65 lax propositions in 1679. Toward the end of the 17th century, however, he was the leader of a group of militant anti-jansenists at Louvain.35 Finally, the third of the early commentators we consulted is Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher, whose real name is Bonaventure Van den Dijcke,36 Franciscan of Louvain and the author of: Reflexiones breves ad triginta et unam propositiones nupero decreto de die VII Decembris i6go . . . iustissime damnatas, quibus earum origo et f alsitas et oppositae doctrinae Veritas aperitur per Hilarum a S.

Le Bachelet for the Dictionnaire de Théologie catholique. The article has the title: Alexandre VIII. Propositions condamnées par lui , le 24 août et le 7 décembre i6ço. Although our original plan was to treat all 31 of the condemned propositions, we have limited ourselves to a study of ten, for the following reasons. In the first place, four propositions, namely, nos. 3, 24, 27 and 28 have already been considered by other authors.38 Secondly, proposi- tions 20 and 31 have no specific author, but the source is given as ' 'passim inculcatur populo" and "sic doceri patet in praxi." Thirdly, there are twelve propositions whose sources we have not been able to find, namely, nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, li, 12, 13, 15, 19 and 29.The possibility of finding these sources is lessened due to the fact that copies of some theses from which most of the propositions had been extracted were so rare that the anti- jansenists were reluctant to send to Rome the copy in their possession lest it be lost. Furthermore, the fire of 1914 at the library of the Uni- versity of Louvain has added to the difficulty of bringing these works to light. Fourthly, since our stay in Rome was limited, further research on the remaining propositions was rendered impossible. 35 On Steyaert's change from a jansenist to an anti-jansenist, see L.

PERA I PROPOSITIO 9: Revera peccat, qui odio habet peccatum mere ob eius turpitudinem et disconvenientiam cum natura, sine ullo ad Deum respectu. SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITIO According to the anti-jansenists1 the 9th proposition is found in the Tyrocinium of Macarius Havermans.2 At his baptism at Breda in the Netherlands on September 30, 1644 he was given the name of Lancelot. At the age of 22 he was professed in the Premonstratensian Order at the abbey of St. Michael in Antwerp. In 1669 he was ordained a priest and became a professor in this same abbey. He was esteemed for his great learning. In the year 1674, when only 30 years old, Havermans published his Tyrocinium at Antwerp.3 A year later the second edition appeared, again in the same city, in two volumes with additions and corrections. It is to this second edition that the anti-jansenists attributed the ninth proposition in the second tract, fourth chapter, second paragraph, page 97. A brief description of this work is in place. It has two parts. The title of the first part is: Tyrocinium theologiae moralis ad mentem SS. Patrum praesertim S. Augustini. De novo auctum et correctum per F. Havermans Ordinis Praemonstratensis Canonicum S. Theologiae Professorem. Editio secunda , Antwerpiae, apud Viduam Reneri Sieghers , Typographi in Platea de Cammer straet, sub insignis Arthesiae , cum gratia et privilegio , J675. After a letter of dedication to the abbot of St. Michaers Abbey, and after two pages of verse in praise of the author, there follows a lengthy preface of 98 pages. Then begins the text of part one (pp. 99 - 408). It is divided into eight chapters which treat of topics as the 1 This proposition is found, with Duffy: under n. 151 in the Theologia Baio-ianseniana, part one; n. 106 of the 356 propositions, n. 26 of the 96 propositions; with Porter: under n. 105 of the 238 propositions, n. 28 of the 105 propositions. 2 Concerning the Tyrocinium, cfr. below; concerning the author, see Biographie nationale, vol.

Tractatus secundus , auctore F. Macario Havermans . . . 1675. This section, which is divided into fourteen chapters (pp. 3 - 303), treats of the morality of human acts, intention, relation of works to God, indifferent acts, etc. At the end is the index followed by the Summa Privilegii, a paragraph concerning rights of the printer. Not long after the publication of the Tyrocinium , the author was accused of holding jansenistic doctrine.5 Not only the 9th proposition, but also the 10th, as we shall see later, are ascribed to this book. Haver- mans, however, answered his attackers with; Defensio brevis Tyrocinii Moralis Theologiae F . Macarii Havermans contra Theses R. P. N. e Societate Jesu illi oppositas , Coloniae 1676, pp. 461 .6 He even addressed a "letter" of 215 pages to Pope Innocent XI in which he defends himself against the accusations of the anti-jansenists.7 It has been claimed that Havermans, several hours before his death, received communication from Innocent XI approving his works.8 He died on February 20, 1680 at the early age of 35. EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT In the Tyrocinium it is the fourth chapter with which we are con- cerned. Paragraph two of this chapter bears the title: "Variae intentiones ex quibus possumus opera bona f acere."

PERA reasons which may motivate man to avoid evil and do good. He asserts one may act from the motive merely to please man, to act as becoming a rational creature, to avoid hell, to enjoy spiritual delights, to obtain heavenly glory, to acquire this glory so that one may glorify and love God, to please the Divine Goodness, and finally, purely propter Deum. We shall now give our consideration to the second reason listed by the author, namely, avoiding evil and doing good because this is becoming a rational creature. The text is as follows: Secunda inten tio potest vocari intentio Stoica , quia Stoici quidem in suis actionibus appetebant honestatem rationis, verum nonnisi ut ipsis commodam, et naturae rationalis ornativam; altius enim amore naturali ascendi nequit . . . Unde ipsorum virtù tes verae Christianaeque virtù tis nomine non sunt honorandae. Stoicismům resuscitant, qui docent actum virtutis ilium exercere, qui bonum morale operatur praecise propter natu- ralem honestatem sine relatione ad Deum, mirandumque valde non tantum Philosophos, sed et nominatos Theologos hodie adhuc docere taliter operan- tes non peccare, imo non desunt, qui adhuc jactitare audent quod id ex ipso Augustino convincant. Augustino nostro variis locis reclamante ac docente9: "Absit autem ut virtù tes verae cuiquam serviant, nisi illi, vel propter ilium cui dicimus: Deus virtutum converte nos. Proinde virtutes quae carnalibus delectationibus, vel quibusque commodis et emolumentis temporalibus serviunt, verae prorsus esse non possunt. Quae autem nulli rei servire volunt, nec ipsae verae sunt. Verae quippe virtutes, Deo serviunt in hominibus, a quo donantur hominibus; Deo serviunt in Angelis, a quo donantur et Angelis. Quidquid autem boni fit ab homine, et non propter hoc fit, propter quod fieri vera sapientia praecipit, etsi officio videatur bonum, ipso non recto fine peccatum est." Et alibi10: "Licet a quibusdam tunc verae et honestae putentur esse virtutes, cum ad seipsas referuntur, nec propter aliud expetuntur; etiam tunc inflatae ac superbae sunt et ideo non virtutes, sed vitia iudicanda sunt." Nec mirum, cum clarissime doceat11: "Non esse veram virtutem, nisi quae ad eum finem tendit, ubi est bonum hominis, quo melius non est." Vere ergo illos virtutum actus seipsum suasque operationes habet, cum sibi det locum finis cui ultimi, suisque operationibus finis cuius ultimi; quod est seipsum nimis efferre, sibique tribuere honorem, qui soli Deo debetur. Ex illis fit consequens quod sicuti re vera peccat, qui amat virtutes propter earum pulchritudinem et conformitatem cum natura rationali sine respectu ad Deum, ita etiam revera peccet qui odio habet peccatum mere ob eius turpitudinem et disconvenientiam cum natura rationali sine ullo ad Deum offensum respectu, quam vis enim talis actio ex officio sit 9 This quotation is from the Contra Julianum, book 4, chapter 3.

Unde liquet non sufficere ad Sacramentum poenitentiae, si quis doleat propter turpitudinem peccati: accedente et hoc quod ille dolor viribus naturae facile haberi possit, dolor autem naturalis non sufficiat ad Sacramentum poenitentiae, cum saepius definitum sit neminem posse poenitere sicut oportet sine divinae gloriae dono.12 In the above text is clearly found our 9th proposition with only two minor changes, namely, peccai instead of peccet , and cum natura instead of cum natura rationali. It is interesting to note that Duffy in his Theo- logia Baio-ianseniana, as well as in his list of 96, omits the phrase sine ullo ad Deum offensum respectu - a phrase which is deeply significant, as we shall see later.13 DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT In the judgment of the anti-jansenists our 9th proposition repeats the doctrine of Luther. Among his errors which were condemned by Leo X in the bull Exsurge Domine of June 15, 1520, we find the following14: Contritio, quae paratur per discussionem, collationem et detestationem peccatorum, qua quis recogitat annos suos in amaritudine animae suae, ponderando peccatorum gravitatem, multitudinem, foeditatem, amissionem aeternae beatitudinis, ac aeternae damnationis acquisitionem, haec contritio facit hypocritam, immo magis peccatorem. In the Council of Trent, session 14, chapter 4 we find the positive doctrine relative to attrition thus expressed15: Illam vero contritionem imperfectam quae attritio dicitur, quoniam vel ex turpitudinis peccati consideratione vel ex gehennae et poenarum metu communiter concipitur, si voluntatem peccandi excludat cum spe veniae, declarat non solum non f acere hominem hypocritam et magis peccatorem, verum etiam donum Dei esse et Spiritus Sancti impulsum, non adhuc quidem inhabitantis, sed tantum moventis, quo poenitens adiutus viam sibi ad iustitiam parat. In their criticism of the 9th proposition the anti-jansenists16 also appealed to this passage of the Council of Trent. 12 Of the 65 laxist propositions condemned by the Holy Office on March 4, 1679, the 57th proposition is as follows: "Probabile est, sufficere attritionem naturalem, modo honestam." Cfr. DENZINGER, n. 1207. 13 It is only in the list of 356 that Duffy cites the entire proposition. Number 106 in this list reads: "Peca en realidad de verdad, el que mera- mente aborrece el pecado por la torpeza y disonancia disconveniencia que tiene con la naturaleza racional, si falta algún respecto a que Dios es ofendido por el pecado/' 14 DENZINGER, n. 746. 15 DENZINGER, n. 898. 16 Cfr.

PERA Porter17 in his short commentary relative to this proposition indirect- ly refers to Luther in as far as he says it is contrary to the Council of Trent, session 14, canon 5. 18 He explicitly states, however, that it is ad mentem Bail , for it follows from the necessity of having a love of God in every human act.19 Let us now consider the different opinions of the official examiners of this proposition. Upon his first examination Sabbatini refused to give a final statement, until he was able to consult the book itself and speak with the author. This hesitation is due to the fact that Cardinal Ricci previously had stated that some words, which were missing, should be added. Sabbatini, however, did say that the proposition, as presented by the accuser, is erroneous because it approached the errors of Luther, as we mentioned above. Later, we discover he does not wish to censure this proposition.20 Of all the examiners Fabri and the Master of the Sacred Palace were the most mild.21 The former merely stated it was scandalous, and the latter, scandalous and disturbing to the faithful. Three others bring in the notion of heresy. Dominic of the Holy Trinity holds that the proposition is rash, erroneous, and tasting of heresy. For Esparza it is scandalous, disturbing to the faithful, tasting of heresy. In the opinion of Mazza 17 Cfr. Porter's list of 105 at proposition 28. AOS, 193. 18 Canon 5 is as follows: Si quis dixent, earn contntionem, quae paratur per discussionem, collectionem et detestationem peccatorum, qua quis recogitat annos suos in amaritudine animae suae [Is. 38, 15], ponderando peccatorum suorum gravitatem, multitudinem, foeditatem, amissionem aeternae beatitudinis, et aeternae damnationis incursum, cum propositio melioris vitae, non esse verum et utilem dolorem, nec praeparare ad gratiam, sed facere hominem hypocritam et magis peccatorem; demum illam esse dolorem coactum et non liberum ac voluntarium, a. s." Cfr. DENZINGER, n. 915. 19 The 38th condemned proposition of Baius is: "Omnis amor creaturae rationalis aut vitiosa est cupiditas, qua mundus diligitur, quae a Ioanne prohibetur, aut laudabilis illa caritas, qua per Spiritum Sanctum in corde diffusa Deus amatur." Cfr. DENZINGER, n. 1038. According to the anti- jansenists the 9th proposition in our list of 31 implies that attrition is sinful, because it does not proceed from love. 20 The words of Sabbatini are as follows: bi ista propositio 111s terminis constaret quibus ab accusatore defertur, dicerem, esse erroneam, quia accedet ad errorem Lutheri, qui dicebat attritionem et contritionem, ex metu ge- hennae et turpidinem peccati conceptas, esse peccata. Sed quia Emmus Riccius, ut habetur in folio A, dixit illi addenda esse verba, idcirco de illa iudicium ferre pro nunc suspendo quousque authorem ipsum, cui tribuitur, videre ac legere potero, quod hactenus mihi non licuit. Scio enim accusa- toribus temere non esse credendum, ut qui plerumque, dummodo causam obtinere possint, apud etiam incorruptos iudices calumniis agere non veran- tur; et quod propositiones a contextu avulsae aut deportatae saepe alium sensum quam ab auctore intentum generare soient/' Cfr. ms. 899, Rome, Biblioteca Angelica, fol. 251 v. 21 See Killiney Papers , ms. D. 21.</page><page sequence="13">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 31 it is rash and tasting of heresy in as far as it is contrary to the decrees of the councils and popes. Two of the examiners made distinctions. Bianchi says: "Si nomine respectus intelligatur tendentia in Deum per verum actum caritatis stricte dictae, est haeresi ut minimum próxima. Si non per respectum intelligatur tendentia in Deum per aliquem actum elicitum caritatis, non est censurabilis." According to Maderno: "Si intelligatur sine ullo respectu tam ex parte operis quam operantis non est censurabilis ; in sensu vero ab auctore intento, est scandalosa et suspecta de haeresi et coincidit cum 36 a22 Baii damnata.23 Concerning the comments after the condemnation of the 31, Viva24 traces the 9th one back to the errors of Baius, Luther, Calvin and others. He sees its connection with the 7th (which he says is bainistic) in our list of 31. 25 The judgments of Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher,26 Steyaert27 and later, Le Bachelet,28 are all substantially the same, that is, the proposi- tion is based on the necessity of all action proceeding from a love of God. CONCLUSION Let us examine our proposition in its context. It seems to me that Havermans is innocent of the charges laid against him by the anti- jansenists, for by the phrase sine ullo ad Deum offensum respectu he understands a complete exclusion of God as our ultimate end. My reasons for this assertion is based on the following. Recall that in the fourth chapter the author is discussing various intentions from which our actions may proceed. The second intention (intentio stoica) consists in avoiding evil and doing good because this is befitting a rational 22 DENZINGER, n. 1036. 23 The summary report of F. Diaz is as follows : Censura quinqué theologorum fuit quod haec propositio sit suspecta de haeresi, haeresique próxima; duorum vero quod sit scandalosa et perturbati va fidelium."

According to our Premonstratensian, they resuscitate Stoicism "qui bonum morale operatur praecise propter naturalem honestatem sine relatione ad Deum." This statement of itself does not prove our point, but let us continue the examination of the context. Havermans cites three effective quotations from St. Augustine (confer the text above). Note for example the following: "Licet a quibusdam tunc verae et honestae putentur esse virtutes, cum ad seipsas referuntur, nec propter aliud expetuntur; etiam tunc inflatae ac superbae sunt, et ideo non virtutes, sed vitia iudicanda sunt." After presenting the quotations, Havermans makes the important statement: Vere ergo illos virtu tum actus superbiae accusat S. Augustinus quia talis operans nimis alto loco seipsum suasque operationes habet, cum sibi det locum finis cui ultimi , suisque operationibus finis cuius ultimi; quod est seipsum nimis efferre, sibique tribuere honorem, qui soli Deo debetur. In other words there is expressed here a situation in which man is substituted for God as the final end. Such is the meaning, therefore, which the author attributes to the words, "sine ullo ad Deum offensum respectu." The same is deduced from what proximately follows: "quam- vis enim talis actio ex officio sit optima, ipso tamen non recto fine peccaminose fit." In other words, the act itself - hatred of sin "ob eius turpitudinem et disconvenientiam cum natura rationali" is good, but be- cause of the finis "sine ullo ad Deum offensum respectu" it becomes sinful. The anti-jansenists were correct in saying the 9th proposition ac- cording to their interpretation repeats errors of Luther and is baianistic - and for these reasons it has been condemned. They are mistaken, how- ever, in saying that the 9th proposition thus understood is found in the Tyrocinium of Macarius Havermans. II PROPO SITIO io:Intentio, qua quis detestatur malum et prosequitur bonum mere, ut coelestem obtineat gloriam, non est recta nec Deo placens. SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION Our tenth proposition, as the preceeding one, is attributed to the Tyrocinium of Macarius Havermans, and in the same tract and chapter as proposition 9.1 We shall, therefore, immediately pass to the considera- tion of the context. 1 This proposition is found with Duffy : under n. 42 of the 1 neologia Baio-ianseniana, part three; under n. 95 of the 356 propositions, n. 61 of the 96 propositions; with Porter: under n. 107 of the 238 propositions, n. 30 of the 105 propositions.</page><page sequence="15">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 33 EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT It will be recalled that the author in the fourth chapter discusses eight intentions from which our actions may proceed. In the fifth place he says that one may avoid evil and do good mere ut coelestem obtineat gloriam. Havermans writes: Quinta intentio vocari potest intentio mercenaria; cum mercenarii sua opera faciant mere, ut promissum suis laboribus praemium consequentur ; unde si non sperarent se consecuturos illud praemium, opera ilia non facerent. Tali intentione multi Christiani hodie sua faciunt opera, solam, aut saltem praecipue, intuentes mercedem, et quidem non alium ob finem quam propter propriam utilitatem, seu ex amore proprio ; quales isti esse soient, qui Deo non serviunt nisi mercedem aliquam ab ilio exspectarent, quique viso lupo fugiunt, et dimittunt oves, quoniam non pertinet ad eos de ovibus, id est non salutem ovium, sed suam tantum quaerunt utilitatem. Intentio haec non est recta nec bona, ut enim recte observât S. Bernardus (Liber de diligendo Deo): "Vacua caritas esse non potest, nec tamen mercenaria est."2 Thus we have the obvious passage from which our proposition has been taken. The slight change is also noted. Where the condemned prop- osition has non est recta nec Deo placens , the text of Havermans reads non est recta nec bona. Many of the earlier lists of the propositions give this latter reading.3 Although Haverman's treatment of the intentio mercenaria extends from page 101 to 108, in no place have I found the direct and explicit statement non est recta nec Deo placens. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT As with proposition 9, Porter4 in like manner judges this one to be according to the mind of Baius, following from the necessity of the love of God in every human action. In the list of 105 this proposition is included under the heading, "De caritate, eius praecepto, necessaria relatione operum in Deum ex caritate." It is not surprising that Porter claims that the proposition is contrary to the Council of Trent, session 6, canon 31 5 : "Si quis dixerit, iustificatum peccare, dum intuitu aeternae 2 Liber de diligendo Deo, cap .

The comments of the other anti-jan- senists even see here the errors of Luther and Calvin.6 In the judgment of the faculty of Louvain7 the proposition was understood as excluding every relation to God. Therefore, it is correct as it stands and not to be censured. On the other hand, if one wishes heavenly glory, so that in the first place God may be glorified, this is a good act. The comments of the faculty concludes with the following remark : Ergo mentem suam sic aperuit facultas cum Cardinale Bellarmino, tom. 4, lib. 5 de iustificatione, cap. g in responsione ad i. 2. 3. argumentum8: "Nos non dicimus in bonis operibus solam, ac praecipue, spectandam esse mercedem, sed Deum, eiusque gloriam tamquam finem ultimum, mercedem autem, ut finem secundarium qui propter Deum, eiusque gloriam expecta- tur; cupimus enim Deum videre, atque ex ea visione felices effici, ut tanto ardentius, et securius Dominum diligamus." Sabbatini defends our tenth proposition for he understands it in the sense that God is excluded as the ultimate end. He writes9: Non est censurabilis eo sensu intellecta, quo casu auctor intellexisse videtur, scilicet, quod si quis solum detestatur malum et prosequitur bonum ut pro ultimo fine habeat gloriam, tamquam et quatenus sibi commode est. Nam ut ait S. Augustinus Liber 50 homiliarum, homilia 38, 10 "ca vere debe- mus, ne ad praemium diligamus Deum." Praeterea nisi amor suipsius ad Deum referatur actu vel virtute, est vitiosus, sed "qui detestatur malum etc." ad praemium tantum respicit et intendit beatitudinem tamquam ulti- mum finem, ergo.

Haec S. Thomas, ex quibus sic arguo. "Intentio qua quis detestatur malum etc." in amore proprii boni finem constituit, ergo ipsius intentio non est recta et Deo placens. Only one of the theologians of the Holy Office was in accord with Sabbatini in saying our tenth proposition is not to be censured. Three proclaimed it heretical and two judged it sapiens haeresim. Dominic of the Blessed Trinity made the following distinction: "Si li mere accipiatur excludendo alium finem non est censurabilis ; absolute tarnen est de haeresi suspecta, si non haeretica prout définit Trid. sessio 6, canon 31."11 In General, the various commentators after the condemnation of this proposition, as Viva,12 Steyaert,13 Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher,14 as also Le Bachelet,15 raise the same objections, namely, reducible to the errors of Luther, Calvin, Baius and Jansenius. However, we do notice another point indicated by these men. They say the tenth prop- osition is contrary to the doctrine of the Church concerning the theo- logical virtue of hope, for to avoid evil and to do good that heaven may be obtained is to act formally from a motive of christian hope , not of charity. CONCLUSION What is to be said regarding the tenth proposition? As usual, we do not wish to enter deeply into all the theological disputes. However, several remarks are in place. First of all, Havermans was not unaware that his doctrine was being denounced as bainistic. As already mentioned in our consideration of proposition 9, he answered his opponents by his Defensio brevis Tyrocinii M oralis Theologiae and the Epistola apologetica to Innocent XI. For example, in the latter work he writes16: 11 Bianchi agreed with Sabbatini in not censuring this proposition. Esparza, Maderno and Mazza held it as heretical. Fabri and the Master of the Sacred Palace judged it as sapiens haeresim. See Killiney Papers, D. 21. Later in his summary report Diaz stated the following: "Censura sex theologorum fuit quod dicta propositio sit suspecta de haeresi, vel haeretica absolute et periculosa."

Secondly, it seems that the anti-jansenists were somewhat over enthusiastic in seeking the condemnation of our Premonstratensian. If we examine the section of the Tyrocinium 18 where the author treats actions placed mere ut coelestem obtineat gloriam , we note the following. Havermans says those acting from such a motive have a mercenary intention. Mercenaries perform actions only to obtain the promised reward. Many Christians act in a like manner. They regard only the prize. They act for no other end than their own advantage and own love. If we compare this passage (as given above) with a text of Cardinal Bellarmine, a striking similarity is noted. In the section under considera- tion Bellarmine is also treating of acting intuitu mercedis aeternae. He writes19 : Mercenarios proprie non vocari, nisi qui mercedem solam, aut praecipue intuentur. Isti enim sunt, qui si merces nulla praesto esset, Domino non servirent. Isti etiam sunt, qui viso lupo fugiunt et dimittunt oves ; quoniam non pertinet ad eos de ovibus, id est, non ovium salutem, sed propriam tantum utilitatem propositam habent. Hos igitur Dominus reprehendit, nec non S. Bernardus et S. Thomas.20 To further understand the position of Havermans, it will be very useful to quote another passage of the Tyrocinium , still in the section concerning the intentio mercenaria. He writes21: Petes an ergo non habeant rectam intentionem qui operantur intuitu mercedis aeternae ? Respondeo catholicum dogma est, quod licite et lauda- biliter cum Psalmista "inclinemus cor nostrum ad faciendas iustificationes 17 These are the condemned propositions of Michael Baius, n. 25 and 38. See DENZINGER, n. 1025 and 1038. In the Tyrocinium , chapter VI "De relatione operum in Deum" Haver- mans gives his views on this matter and in the following pages he answers various objections. 18 As mentioned above, this is referring to the Tyrocinium , 2nd edition, Antwerp, 1675, tract 2, chap. 4, p. 101 - 108. 19 Opera omnia, ed. cit., p. 617. 20 It is to be noted that the texts of Havermans and Cardmal Bellarmine are very similar. Probably they made use of the same sources. 21 Op. cit., p. 103 - 105.</page><page sequence="19">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex.

Is not this in substance what had been related by Cardinal Bel- larmine as presented by the faculty of Louvain, as we mentioned above ? Furthermore, the Cardinal after citing a passage from the Council of Trent, session 6, chapter 1122, remarks23: Ubi clare videmus non tantum nec praecipue amore mercedis operandům esse ex doctrina concilii, sed primům quidem propter gloriam Dei, deinde etiam propter mercedem felicitatis aeternae. Our tenth proposition, as it stands, has been justly condemned - understood especially in a baianistic sense. I do not believe it has been condemned according to the mind of Macarius Havermans, its proposed author according to the anti-jansenists. Ill PROPOSITIO 14: Timor gehennae non est supernaturalis. SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION This proposition is attributed to the Dissertatio dogmatica , cap. J5, fol. J4 et 75 of Christian Lupus.

He was pro- fessed in the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine in 1628. Later, while teaching philosophy at Cologne, he became acquainted with Cardinal Fabio Chigi, the future Alexander VII.3 It was in 1640 that he was called to Louvain where he successfully fulfilled his duty as professor of theol- ogy, basing his teaching on the doctrine of St. Augustine. From this time till his death on various occasions he was accused of Jansenism, but more than once he justified himself at Rome. It was reported that Lupus, who studied about fifteen hours every day, assimilated all that he read. For this reason he was called the walking library. In his effort to obtain the doctorate, he was at first impeded, having been accused of Jansenism. He did obtain this title, however, at Louvain on February 4, 1653. In the autumn of 1655 Lupus went to Rome, where he cleared himself of the charges made against him. For five years he remained in the Eternal City keeping occupied with intellectual pursuits, and refus- ing various positions of honor and dignities which were offered to him. After his return in 1660 Lupus became at Louvain one of the eight regents of the faculty of theology. It was in 1677 that he again visited Rome as a member of a committee of the University to petition the condemnation of some propositions concerning laxity in moral theology.4 He died in Louvain on July 10, 1681. The Dissertatio dogmatica of Lupus has been cited by the anti- jansenists as the source of this proposition.

As is evident from the title, the work deals with various questions of attrition and contrition, concerning which lively discussions were being waged by theologians of that time.6 EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT It is chapter 15, p. 74 and 75 which is of interest to us. The general topic under discussion is (servile) fear of hell. This fear is not concerned with the seventh gift of the Holy Spirit by which one, moved by a filial love of God, fears lest by sinning he offend his beloved Father. Also the fear which Lupus is treating greatly differs from that which is called initial or mixed, which already contains the beginning, although imper- fect, of love of God. This latter is a mixture of love of God and love of self. On the contrary, our proposition concerns the servile fear of hell. Already in chapter 12 Lupus presents various notions of this fear. Whereas chapter 13 is concerned with the usefulness of servile fear, the following chapter discusses its various imperfections. Chapter 15 is introduced by the question : " An ob istas imperfectiones servilis gehenna- rum metus sit peccatum?" To the question Lupus responds by refuting two errors of Luther, who held that not only the fear of hell was a sin, but also the imperfect contrition conceived from it. Against the first error of Luther, the author cites the Council of Trent, session 6, canon 8: "Si quis dixerit, gehennae metum, per quem ad misericordiam Dei de peccatis dolendo confugimus vel a peccando abstinemus, peccatum esse aut peccatores peiores facere, a. s."6 After 6 Concerning these controversies see ; L.

After consulting the above it will be evident that discussion on this matter existed long before the publication of the work of Lupus. Wherefore Estrix in his Specimen is somewhat hasty when he writes: "Anno 1666. Exarsit Lo vanii contentio de attritione, quae tenuit annos plures scriptis hinc et hinc disputationibus polemicis non paucis. Quis principium huic pugnae dedit? CHRISTIANUS LUPUS S.T.D. Lovaniensis, qui Anno 1666 edidit dissertationem dogmaticam de contritione et attritione." Cfr. Specimen, part VII, chapter 14, p. 53. 6 DENZINGER, n. 818. Of this canon Lupus says : " Quidam non de pure servili, sed de initiali seu mixto, adeoque et ab adiuncta servilitate purgato metu existimant statui a Synodo. Et opinio non caret fundamentis. Ego credo statui etiam de pure servili." Cfr. LUPUS, op. cit., p. 73.</page><page sequence="22">40 S. PERA various explanations which indicate that the fear of hell is not a sin, the text from which proposition 14 was extracted, thus occurs: Hinc item laudatus timor [servilis gehennae], licet infusum ac super- naturalem fidei actum frequenter praesupponat, non est tamen ipse actus infusus aut supernaturalis. Quod fidem istam frequenter supponat, diserte tradit sanctus Augustinus . . . Dico timorem hune non posse esse sine aliqua fide, et fidem infusam ab ipso frequenter supponi. Haec enim non semper supponitur. Etenim haeretici etiam, quin et quidem pagani, a quibus remotissima est infusa fides, gehen- nam timent et timuerunt. Sufficit ergo animalis fides, et quaevis humana credulitas aut persuasio, qualem carnalibus Iudaeis infuisse scribit in libro De spiritu et litera, cap. 32 sanctus Augustinus. Addo etiam illum, qui fidem infusam praesupponit, non esse infusum aut supernaturalem. Quod enim non ex speciali Dei per Iesum Christum dono, sed ex proprio sui amore, adeo- que ex puro libero arbitrio nascatur, est supra ostensum ex sancto Augustino. Et res ipsa clamat. Nam qui aeque de infligenda peccatis suis per iustum et optimum Deum gehenna, ac de infligendo per hominem Regem capitali supplicio non dubitat, utrumque malum non potest non aequaliter, immo istud longe magis fugere et horrere. Licet porro timor ille non sit infusus, est tamen a Deo incussus actus, quarum divinarum causalitatum differen- tiam exponere non spectat ad quaestionem praesentem. Gehennae metum, uti sanctum et Dei donum laudari vario sancti Augustini et aliorum Patrum testimonium novi: nempe, non omni istius mali metus est servilis; aliquis etiam castus est, qualis fuit in Adam ante lapsum, et in multis postea Sanctis, timentibus illud, non quia ipsis durum sit, sed quia intellectualis creaturae a naturali eius fine separativum. Lupus continues by refuting the second error of Luther, which is that attrition conceived from fear of hell is a sin. Against this error the author proposed the teaching of the Council of Trent, session 14, chapter 4 which states that such attrition does not make one a hypocrite and more of a sinner, but is a true gift of God and impulse of the Holy Spirit.7 In concluding this chapter the Augustinián refers to two movements in the soul of the penitent : the one a fear of hell or of other punishments from which imperfect contrition is commonly conceived; the other, the attrition itself conceived from this fear. On the latter Lupus writes: Hanc définit [Concilium] esse motum, non dumtaxat utilem, sed et, licet non perfectam, tamen veram contritionem, Spiritus Sancti donum et impulsum, actum non incussum, sed infusum, impetrandae peccatorum remissioni praeparationem cum Sacramento aptam et omnino sufficientem. Quae omnia coece ac impie Lutherus impugnarat. 7 DENZINGER, n. 897-898.</page><page sequence="23">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 41 Behold, therefore the context from which the 14th proposition was taken. There is no doubt that it is almost verbally contained in chapter 15. We say almost because in the extracted proposition there is left out the word servile. This word is of great importance because it indicates the author is not treating of initial or mixed fear, but only of that fear which is based entirely on love of oneself. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT In the opinion of Porter8 the doctrine of the 14th proposition "parum videtur coherere cum doctrina Tridentini, sess. 14, cap. 4 et 5," where it is defined that attrition conceived either from the turpitude of sin or the fear of hell and its punishments, is a gift of God. The anti-jan- senists give a similar judgment9: Pugnat cum declaratione Tridentini, sessione 14, capite 4, "illam vero contritionem imperfectam quae attritio dicitur, quoniam vel ex turpitudinis peccati consideratione vel ex gehennae et poenarum metu communiter con- cipitur, si voluntatem peccandi excludat cum spe veniae, declarat" (scilicet Synodus) "non solum non f acere hominem hypocritam et magis peccatorem, verum etiam donum Dei esse et Spiritus Sancti impulsum impulsus, autem, Spiritus Sancti et donum Dei, est quid supernaturaliter, attritio autem ex gehennae metu concepta secundum Concilium est impulsus Spiritus Sancti, igitur est supernaturalis. The individual opinions of all the examiners of the Holy Office are lacking. There is, however, the full text of the view of Sabbatini, who comes to the defense of his confrere in religion10: Hac propositione iterum a delatore in iudicium vocatur P. Lupus,11 sed diminute ipsa propositio refertur, ita, nempe, habetur et sub his terminis in disputatione dogmatica cap. 15 fol. 74 "laudatus timor (scilicet servilis, qui ex metu gehennae concipitur) licet infusum ac supernaturalem fidei ac- tum frequenter praesupponat, non est tarnen ipse actus infusus et supernatura- lis/ ' ex quo apparet a P. Lupo supernaturalitatem ab ipso timore gehennae non semper excludi, immo frequenter praesupponi; sed propositio ipsa sub censura cadere non potest, nam ñeque ex S.

Quidem scio aliquos, qui contra P. Lupum scripserunt hoc Tridentini testimonio uti ut minus acutis persuadeant timorem gehennae esse super- naturalem, sed profecto ipsi insigniter hallucinantur, nam Concilium agit de attritione quae ex timore gehennae concipitur, quam contra Lutherum declarat non solum non facere hominem hypocritam etc., sed etiam donum Dei esse et Spiritus Sancti impulsum etc., ex quo manifeste patet, quod illi qui ex hoc loco timoris gehennae supernaturalitatem probant, causam cum effectu imperite confundunt: effectus, nempe, metus gehennae est attritio, ipse autem metus gehennae est causa seu motivům attritionis. Nec ratione destituitur propositio quia si timor gehennae esset super- naturalis, vel esset quoad substantiam, vel quoad modum, at neutro modo est supernaturalis, ergo, etc. Maior est certa; minor probabilis: non est supernaturalis quoad substantiam, quia qui timet habet pro fine proprium commodum, nempe, fugam mali; nec quoad modum, quia oritur ex puro arbitrio, nec indiget auxilio supernaturali quo eliciatur, ergo, etc. Huic doctrinae consonat S. Thomas 2. 2. q. 19, art. 9, timor servilis, inquit, non est numerandus inter dona Spiritus Sancti, licet sit a Spiritu Sancto. Similia habet articulo 5 in cuius commentario Petrus de Aragonia scribit quod, supposita divina revelatione, qua poenae supernaturales manifestantur, potest homo sine alio auxilio ex parte voluntatis metuere ac fugere gehennam etc. Haec Petrus de Aragonia. In quo sensu dicit etiam P. Lupus, ut a principio dixi, timorem gehennae infusum ac supernatu- ralem fidei actum frequenter praesupponere, et pag. 75 dicit hunc gehennae timorem non esse infusum et supernaturalem, propterea "quod non ex speciali Dei per Iesum Christum dono, sed ex proprio sui amore, adeoque ex puro libero arbitrio nascatur," et mox, "licet porro," inquit, "timor ille non sit infusus, est tamen a Deo incussus actus;" qui demum sic concludit, "gehennae metum, ut sanctum et Dei donum laudari vario S. Augustini et aliorum Patrum testimonio novi." Quod si P. Lupus damnandus est propterea quod in ilio libello disser- tationis dogmaticae etc. scripserit timorem gehennae non esse supernaturalem, graviori censura notandi essent Scotus, Dominicus Soto et Melchior Canus qui docuerunt attritiones naturales dari posse quae in sacramento poeni- tentiae ad iustificationem sufficiunt.

VIII 43 et 2 de natura et gratia cap. 15 docet attritiones ex fine naturali et metu poenarum conceptas quae in sacramento poenitentiae ad iustificationem sufficiunt posse esse naturales. Idem docuit Melchior Canus . . . The summary given by Diaz12 states that the majority of the theo- logians held that the proposition is male sonans et scandalosa ; some claimed it was heretical in a certain sense ; and others in another sense excused it from condemnation. In his treatment of the 14th proposition Viva13 neither refers to the name nor the opinion of Lupus, when he writes that, according to Baius, Jansenius and Carolus ab Assumptione,14 that fear is bad and is not supernatural even if it would proceed from a motive which is known by supernatural enlightenment, e. g., from the fear of hell or its punish- ments, in as far as inflicted by God. Viva himself holds that fear con- ceived from a motive known supernaturally is certainly supernatural. As a proof he appeals to the Council of Trent, to those passages cited above. Although in session 14, chapter 4 we read: "Illam vero contritio- nem imperfectam , quae attritio dicitur, quoniam vel ex turpitudinis peccati consideratione vel ex gehennae et poenarum metu communiter concipitur, si voluntatem peccandi excludat cum spe veniae . . . verum etiam donum Dei esse et Spiritus Sancti impulsum," Viva asserts: "Et capitulum 4 huiusmodi timor em appellat bonum motum, Dei donum et Spiritus Sancti impulsum." Steyaert15 in the same manner interprets this passage of the Council of Trent, i. e., as referring also to the fear itself as well as the attrition conceived from this fear. Neither does he give any indication to Lupus as the author of the 14th proposition. Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher16 in the very beginning of his con- sideration presents his definition of the timor gehennae in the following manner: "Porro timor gehennae, de quo hic agitur, non respicit nude poenas gehennae propter poenas, quatenus sunt malum aliquod naturale ibi sistendo : sed respicit poenas illas, quas homo fide praelucente credit a Deo propter peccata infligendas, quibus in aeternum et in sensibus crucietur et adeptione, ac possessione summi boni, quod Deus est, privetur." It is therefore evident according to this anti-jansenist the timor gehennae always includes a supernatural element. Thus he differs from the opinion of Lupus, as we have seen above. 12 AGOFM, III, h, fol. 700V. 13 VIVA, op. cit., p. 55 - 57. 14 Cfr. P. COSMAS DE VILLI ER S, Bibliotheca Carmelitana , Rome 1927, col. 311 - 312. 15 STEYAERT, op. cit., p. 352 - 354. 16 HILARIUS A S. SEPULCHRO, op. cit., p. 26-28.</page><page sequence="26">44 PERA Hilary also asserts that according to Luther, Jansenius and his disciples, namely, John Sinnich, Christian Lupus, Francis Van Vianen and Gummarius Huyghens, this fear is bad and pernicious, if it lacks the dilectio benevolentiae Dei . Likewise, as the other anti-jansenists, he declares that proposition 14 is contrary to the Council of Trent in the places already indicated. Although he refers to the Dissertatio dogmatica of Lupus, he does not indicate the place designated by Porter as the source of the proposition. Le Bachelet,17 who treats propositions 14 and 15 together, attributes our 14th proposition to Lupus in chapter 15. He says that the doctrine of these two propositions have a twofold basis: the one baianistic, by which it is denied that attrition which does not proceed from a love of God but from a fear of hell and punishments is able to be a good and supernatural movement ; the other, by which it is asserted that attrition without an efficacious will of avoiding sin is not able to be supernatural. CONCLUSION It seems to me that the anti- jansenist who extracted this proposition did not accurately and fully express the mind of Lupus. For the prop- osition which simply asserts that the fear of hell is not supernatural, does not take into account the distinction which the author has in the text concerning the servile fear itself and the attrition conceived from this fear. Of the fear, as distinct from attrition, and of the fear alone, according to Lupus, although it is a movement a Deo incussus and for the most part presupposes an infused and supernatural act of faith, in itself it is not supernatural. What is to be said concerning this view of Lupus? The anti-jan- senists, who have interpreted chapter 4 of the Council of Trent (session 14) not only of attrition but also of the fear of hell, are by this very fact forced to judge the view of Lupus as contrary to the teaching of Trent.18 Of the authors writing immediately after the decree of condemnation Viva and Steyaert give no mention of Lupus or his work. A third, namely, Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher, merely mentions the treatise of Lupus at chapter 15. For the rest, he is prudently silent. All this seems to indicate that according to these authors the view of Lupus 17 LE BACHELET, op. cit., col. 756 - 757. 18 .tutrix in his specimen reters to the Dissertano dogmatica, chapter 15, p. 74 and 75 under the paragraph entitled: "Assertiones affirmantium attritionem ex timore gehennae, aut ipsum gehennae timorem, non esse donum Dei, aut Spiritus Sancti impuls um." Cfr. op. cit., part II, chapter 4, par. 2.</page><page sequence="27">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex . VIII 45 is one still open for free discussion. On the other hand, proposition 14 in its obvious sense certainly is to be judged as male sonans and scanda- losa , and is worthy of condemnation. IV PROPOSITIO 16: Ordinem praemittendi satisfactionem absolutioni induxit non politia aut institutio Ecclesiae, sed ipsa Christi lex et praescriptio, natura rei id ipsum quodammodo dictante. SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION The source of the 16th proposition according to Porter is "auctor compendiosae deductionis seu typographus Gandensis in praefatione, 1672. 1,1 Duffy, while citing the same source in his Theologia Baio-ian- seniana, also refers to Anthony Arnauld's De la frequente Communion , part 2, chapter 8, p. 228. There are others, who, writing after the decree of condemnation, not only indicate the source as given above, but also make mention of Arnauld.2 Since however, Porter in his official list of propositions presented to the Holy Office cites only the " auctor compendiosae deductionis/' we will not enter further into this question concerning Arnauld. After investigating we have discovered that the above notation of Porter refers to the following: Cánones poenitentiales a S.

PERA beginning there is a paragraph in large print with the title Typographies lectori. In this paragraph the printer asserts that these penitential canons are frequently referred to, yet copies of them are rarely found. Therefore, he now presents them, especially for the benefit of those who have the care of souls. He also states that the canons are preceded by the "com- pendiosa ac lucida deductio" which he has received "a viro istarum rerum studioso/' 5 Immediately follows an historical treatise of about 150 pages by an anonymous author concerning the origin, use and decline of these canons. Then follows an approbation of the work by P. De Mey, canon and treasurer of the cathedral of Ghent and censor of books.6 Finally, there is the collection of canons themselves, which occupies about the last 50 pages of the book. This section is entitled: Cartones poenitentiales , quorum cognitio paro chis, conf essor ibusque necessaria est ; dispositi pro ratione ordineque Decalogi. Per Sanctum Carolum Borro - maeum , S. R. E . Cardinalem, Archiepiscopum Mediolanensem. In the first place, penances are given for the various violations of each of the Ten Commandments of God. Then follow the canons relative to the seven capital sins and various other sins. At the end are some declarations "ex poenitentiali Romano/' followed by other brief declarations. In marginal notes are indicated the sources of various canons. Examples of some of the penances are as follows : who kills a priest must do penance for twelve years ; who speaks ill of his parents must eat bread and water for forty days ; the priest who celebrates the Sacrifice of the Mass without receiving Holy Communion, must do penance for a year, and in the meantime, is forbidden to say Holy Mass.7 iussu.

Cardinal Borromaeo had included these penitential canons in his instructions for the administration of the Sacrament of Penance (p. 518 - 534) . His intention was not that these canons be litterally adhered to. Rather, they are to be as a norm for the confessor in giving penances for various sins. (cfr. p. 523). According to St. Charles a knowledge of these canons was necessary, for in the administration of the Sacrament not only prudence and piety must be exercised but also justice (cfr. p. 525). For those cases when absolution must be deferred, according to St. Charles, cfr. p. 11; 765-768; 774-775. 6 Occasionally this work is relerred to as i ypographus Cr anaensis, a title which is false and misleading, for it would seem that the typographus is the author of the compendiosa deductio. From a careful reading of the first paragraph one discovers this is not true. This work is sometimes called prae- fatio Gandensis. 6 Cfr. A. E.

Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher10 gives the same information. As noticed above, the printer at the beginning of the book relates that he has received this preface from some one acquainted with such matters. The only bit of positive information concerning the author that I have found is contained in a second edition of this work published at Cologne in 1678. After the title, one reads: "Per D. I. Gillemans S. T. L.11 ecclesiae Cathedralis Gandavensis Cano- nicum et Archipresbyterum. Editio secunda ab auctore recognita. Colo- niae Agrippinae, Typis Francisci Deckerii ad insigne SS. Petri et Pauli, 1678." Gillemans was no stranger to the anti- jansenist s . In the years 1649 - 1^53 he had accompanied to Madrid John Recht, jansenistic representative of the Belgian bishops and of the University of Louvain, regarding the bull of Urban Vili In eminenti.12 EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT Let us now examine the text of the praefatio Gandensis relative to our 16th proposition13: Hie itaque poenitentiae ordo et decursus erat. Primům confessio pecca- torum poenitentiaeque postulatio. Deinde, impositio poenitentiae, postea, impositae poenitentiae expletio. Ad extremum, absolutio. Ad huius vero 715 - 747. According to the author one of the characteristics of this ministry was rigorism, and this rigoristic aspect was due to the severe character of the saint himself, as well as to the spirit of the times of the Counter-Refor- mation.

In his earlier list of 238 he gives page 20. Duffy in his Theologia Baio-ian- seniana mentions page 24. Sabbatini apparently noticed this discrepancy in the enumeration of pages for he writes: "adscribí tur propositio praefationi Gandavi pag. (ut refertur a delatore) 19 et 20." (Cfr. ms. 899, fol. 254 V - 255 r, Rome, Bibliotheca Angelica). However, in producing the indicated text of the preface of Ghent, Sabbatini has the same as I indicate above, which was found on page 24, as Duffy stated.</page><page sequence="30">48 S. PERA ordinis demonstrationem, quem tot saeculis tam eximium ac salutifenim censuit Ecclesia, unum alterumve dumtaxat proferemus testimonium. Ac primům, S. Gregorius Magnus Horn. 26 in Evang.14: "Videndum est quae culpa praecessit aut quae sit poenitentia secuta post culpam: ut quos omnipotens Deus per compunctionis gratiam visitât, illos Pastoralis sententia absolvat. Tunc enim vera est absolutio praesidentis, cum aeterni arbitrium sequitur iudicis." Similiter, Innocentius I in Epistola I Decret. ita scribit16 "Coeterum de pondere aestimando delictorum, sacerdotis est iudicare, ut attendat ad confessionem poenitentis, et ad fletus atque lachry- mas corrigentis, ac tum iubere dimitti cum viderit congruam satisfactio- nem." Denique, S. Leo Epistola 91 16 haec habet: "Mediator Dei et hominum Homo Christus Iesus, hanc praepositis ecclesiae tradidit potestatem, ut confitentibus actionem poenitentiae darent, et eosdem salubri satisfactione purgatos, ad Communionem Sacramentorum per ianuam reconciliationis admitterent." Ordinem vero hune non consuetudo, non politia, aut institutio Ecclesiae induxit, sed ipsa Christi lex ac praescriptio, natura rei idipsum quodammodo dictante, quod Synodus Tridentina indicare videtur, dum dicit, sessio 14, capitulum 517: "Cum sacerdotes a Christo constituti sint iudices, incognita causa iudicium exercere atque in poenis iniungendis aequitatem servare non possunt." Deinde, "si erubescat aegrotus vulnus medico detegere, quod igno- rât, medicina non curat." Ac demum S. Eligius Horn. 418: "Quicumque peccando factus est Deo inimicus, nisi satisfaciendo non potest reconciliari ut fiat amicus." Atque, "adeo unusquisque vestrum ad se rediens," inquit idem Hom. 16, 19 "consideret si per amaritudinem poenitentiae Deo satis- fecero pro suis offensis ac delictorum maculis ; nam licet ministerium recon- ciliandi Episcopali auctoritate compiere velimus, tamen nisi Spiritus Sanctus, per cuius invocationem istud officium agitur, corda vestra intrinsecus purificata invenerit, a reconciliationis gratia vacui remanebitis." Patet itaque quod confessio peccatoris ad hoc potissimum servat, ut detecto sacerdotibus tamquam medicis ac iudicibus a Christo constitutis, peccati vulnere et crimine, ipsi congruas adhibeant poenitentias medicinales ac satisfactorias, quibus et pravae voluntatis vitium, atque ita peccati malitia curetur, et divinae iustitiae satisfiat: ac demum, ita dispositus, idoneus fiat quin Deo et Ecclesiae per Sacerdotis ministerium reconcilietur. Thus is recognized the place from which our 16th proposition was drawn. We notice the change, namely, the addition of the words "prae- mittendi satisfactionem absolut ioni." Where the term ordo of the above text has a broader extension, in the condemned proposition it is limited 14 MIGNE, Patrologia latina , vol. 76, col. 1200. 16 Ibidem , vol. 3, col. 1030. n.

In other words, the anti-jansenist who extracted the proposition places emphasis on just one phase of this order, namely, the relation of the absolution to the satisfaction. Sabbatini objects that this proposition is not found word in its indicated source. His complete judgment will be given later. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT Porter's judgment is included in a general statement embracing several propositions in his list of 105. 20 He says that these propositions are contrary to the common opinion of theologians and with the ac- cepted practice of the Church for centuries of absolving those who are disposed, before the performance of the penance. Likewise, according to Porter, these propositions are in agreement with the teaching of Peter de Osma, namely "non peracta poenitentia poenitentem absolvi non debere" which was condemned by Sixtus IV.21 The anti-jansenists, who repeat what we have mentioned above with Porter, add yet other items of reproach. Their judgment is as follows22: Hanc eandem sententiam tradit ille apostata Marcus Antonius de Domi- nis, lib. 5 de republica ecclesiastica cap. 723. Vult ista propositio non esse conferendam absolutionem poenitenti nisi prius persolvat iniunctam sibi satisf actionem, idque ortum habere in institutione divina, quod si verum esset, Ecclesia Dei quae a tot saeculis habet in praxi dare absolutionem ante impletam poenitentiam, erraret in re gravissima, idque contra institutionem Christi ; deinde, raro aut numquam liceret absolvere moribundos aut proximo mortis periculo expositos : dicta sententia fuit etiam Petri de Osma doctoris Salamanticensis cuius assertionem inter alias eiusdem Sixtus IV in decreto edito anno 1478 quinto Idus Augusti Pontificatus sui anno octavo declaravit falsam, Sanctae catholicae fidei contrariam, erroneam, scandalosam, ab evangelica veritate penitus alienam ; Sanctorum Patrum et apostolicis constitutionibus contrariam ac manifestam haeresim continere. Thus we find reference not only to Peter de Osma, but also to the apostate Marcus Antonius de Dominis. Furthermore, it is important 20 Cfr. AOS, iQ^ at proposition 47. 21 Peter Martinez, who was called de Osma from the town of his birth, taught at Salamanca. His errors were condemned by Spanish theologians and later by Pope Sixtus IV by the bull Licet ea of August 9, 1479. Cfr. DENZINGER, n. 728. 22 Cfr.

PERA to note that they clearly bring in the notion of the divine institution and its effects, that is, if this proposition would be true, the Church would find herself in a very serious situation, and acting contrary to the prescription of Christ. It is interesting to note that Estrix had previously in his Specimen treated the quoted passage from the Praefatio Gandensis in a paragraph entitled: "assertiones affirmantium, satis- factionem absolutioni praemittendam esse ex institutione Christi, idque ita, ut irrita sit absolutio, si secus fiat."24 Sabbatini does not wish to censure our i6th proposition, because the author of the preface relates the order which according to the Fathers is from the law of Christ. In his explanation and attempt to free this proposition from censure, he thus draws a paralleled case: a similar proposition, namely, "ordinario Dei induxit immunitatem ecclesiasti- corum" cannot be censured because the notion of immunity is had from the divine institution of the clerical order as from its final source. Further- more, even according to the Council of Trent, the immunity of eccle- siastics has been constituted by the ordinance of God. The complete judgment of Sabbatini is as follows26: Adscribitur propositio praefationi Gandensi, id est, praefatione ad Cáno- nes poenitentiales editae Gandavi, pag. (ut refertur a delatore) 19 et 20. Caeterum illic propositio non habetur saltem ad verbum, an vero quoad sensum mox dicam. Dicta praefatio citat tria testimonia: primům, ex S. Gregorio Magno homil. 26 in Evangelio ubi ait: Quos omnipotens Deus per compulsionis gratiam visitât, illos pastoralis sententia absolvat etc.: secundum, ex Innocentio I in epist. 29 decretali qui dicit sacerdotem debere attendere ad confessionem poenitentis et ad f letus atque lacrymas corrigentis ac tum iubere dimitti cum viderit congruam satisf actionem; tertium, ex S. Leone epist. 91 qui scribit in hunc modum: Mediator Dei et hominum homo Christus Iesus hanc praepositis Ecclesiae tradidit potestatem ut con- fitentibus actiones poenitentiae darent, et eosdem salubri satisfactione pur- gatos ad communionem sacramentorum ianuam reconciliationis admitterent. Quibus omnibus praefatio immediate subiicit sequentia. Ordinem vero hunc non consuetudo, non politia aut institutio Ecclesiae induxit, sed ipsa Christi lex ac praescriptio, natura rei idipsum quodammodo dictante. Ex quibus omnibus mihi videtur quod propositio non sit censurabilis, quia praefatio dicit quidem ordinem a Patribus assertum ab ipsa Christi lege, quod cadere non potest sub censura, alioquin haec propositio similis expressionis, immuni- tatem ecclesiasticorum induxit Dei ordinatio.

VIII 51 habetur ratio immunitatis ecclesiasticorum, et propterea Concilium Triden- tinum sessio 25, capitulum 20 de reformatione dicit26: personarum eccle- siasticorum immunitatem Dei ordinatione esse constitutam. The particular views of each of the examiners of the Holy Office are lacking. However, according to the summary report of Diaz the censure of the majority of theologians was that the proposition is rash and injurious to the Church and gravely suspected of other defects.27 Concerning the commentators after the decree of condemnation in 1690, in general the same accusations were brought forth. Viva and Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher as usual present a more elaborate and at times confusing treatise. According to Viva the author of the prop- osition proceeds from a false understanding of the doctrine of matter and form, for he would think that with the sacraments the matter must always preceed the form; and since according to Trent the three acts of the penitent, namely, contrition, confession and satisfaction are the quasi-materia , these three must come before the form. Secondly, according to Viva, it is based on an ancient practice of the Church, which he rejects however, by distinguishing between canonical absolution for the external forum and sacramental absolution for the internal forum. Hilary basing his arguments on the Council of Trent tries to prove that from the institution of Christ the order for the Sacrament of penance is : contrition, confession, absolution then satisfaction. Steyaert occupies himself more with denying that the doctrine of the condemned prop- osition follows from the text of St. Leo as quoted above in the praefatio Gandensis. A point worthy of note is the fact that while the above make reference to the divine institution expressed in the proposition, Le Bachelet does not. In treating propositions 16, 17 and 18 together he says they are false in themselves, injurious to the Church and scandalous in their consequences. CONCLUSION The 16th proposition is truly found in its indicated source. Although the text of the compendiosa ac lucida deductio refers to the order of the sacrament of penance in general, the extracted proposition emphasizes just one part of this order. Such a stress is indeed valid since the partic- ular is contained in the general. On the other hand, we should avoid the mistake of some anti-jan- senists who unduly stressed the notion of divine institution. These 26 The title of this chapter is: "Quae sunt iuris ecclesiastici principibus saecularibus commendantur." 27 AGOFM, III, 11, fol. 701 r. 4*</page><page sequence="34">52 5. PERA seem to indicate that according to the author, Christ himself directly established the order of parts in this sacrament. I don't think this assertion is well-founded for the following reasons. The proposition reads: "Ordinem praemittendi satisfactionem absolutioni induxit . . . ipsa Christi lex et praescriptio . . The word induxit should be taken in its obvious sense of introducing or leading into.26 Concerning the phrase lex et praescriptio Christi , I believe the author wishes to understand it not as from a special mandate of Christ relative to the order of the parts of penance, but as from the general disposition by which Christ in- stituted this sacrament as a tribunal and constituted the priests as judges and doctors. From this general mandate or prescription of Christ, there naturally follows the order of the parts - the order which was observed in the early Church, without nevertheless thinking such an order is entirely unchangeable. Our interpretation is suggested by the quotation from Trent which occurs in the text (cfr. above), namely: "cum sacerdotes a Christo constituti sint iudices, incognita causa iudi- cium exercere atque in poenis iniungendis aequitatem servare non possunt also, "si erubescat aegrotus vulnus medico detegere, quod ignorât, medicina non curat." It is again suggested by the last words of the paragraph which state: "Patet itaque quod confessio peccatoris ad hoc potissimum servat, ut detecto sacerdotibus tamquam medicis ac iudicibus a Christo constitutis, peccati vulnere et crimine ..." As already indicated, according to the report of Diaz, this proposi- tion taken in itself is truly rash, injurious to the Church and gravely suspected of other defects. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to over- stress by Gillemans the idea of immediate divine institution of the order of the parts of the sacrament of penance.

VIII 53 Gabrielis1 was born in Haccourt in 1636. He studied philosophy at Louvain. On July 26, 1664 he received the religious habit of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis. Thirteen years later he obtained the licentiate in Sacred Theology. In the service of his Order, Gabrielis not only served as professor of philosophy and theology, but was also provincial and general definitor. He died at Louvain in 1697 at the age of 61. The Specimina mor alts first appeared in 1675 at Brussels and Louvain.2 On September 27, 1679 ^ was condemned by a decree of the Holy Office.

PERA of the 17th proposition. While Viva makes no mention of the name of Gabrielis on this point, the author of Jansenismus plurimas haereses et errores damnatos pertinaciter defendens cites Arnauld. Although this proposition is found in all the lists of Porter, and in the earlier ones of Duffy, it is lacking in this latter's list of 96. This omission, however, can easily be explained - the presence of a similar proposition, n. 69, which reads: "Praxim absolvendi ante completam satisfactionem censet execrabilem Toletanum Concilium Tertium, can. 11: cui non acquiescere est temerarium." One must remember that Duffy's earlier lists were excessively long and contained many repeti- tions. It was the constant desire of the various examiners to eliminate all the superfluities. In fact, Dominic of the Holy Trinity, in examining Duffy's list of 96, noted the similarity between these two propositions.5 The meaning of the 17th proposition, as it stands, is not entirely clear. For example, what precisely is to be understood by the phrases "per illam praxim mox absolvendi" and "ordo poenitentiae?" After considering its position in the list of 31 and noticing the connection between propositions 16, 17 and 18, it is possible to conclude that the proposition concerns the sacrament of penance and the order of the parts in this sacrament, especially regarding the order of absolution and satisfaction. This conclusion is affirmed by the remarks of Porter and the other anti-jansenists, as we shall soon see. EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT Let us now consider the indicated source of the 17th proposition, namely, the Specimina mor alts of Gabrielis, paragraph 42, p. 154 - 155. The author is advocating performance of the penance imposed by the priest before reception of the sacramental absolution. In paragraph 40 he begins to present some objections which can be raised against the practice he favors. After each objection he gives his answer. Thus in paragraph 40 (p. 140 - 145) the objection is raised: if the performance of penance is required before the absolution, what if some one dies before being absolved? After responding, Gabrielis passes to the next objection, which is found in paragraph 41 (p. 145 - 153), namely, if some one can be absolved "in articulo mortis" without first performing the penance, why not also in the case in which the penitent agrees to make the satisfaction ? The third objection in paragraph 42 (p. 154 - 162) is of more importance to us. Therefore, we present the exact text of the Specimina moralis: 5 Rome, Bibliotheca Angelica, ms. 899, fol. 245 - 246.</page><page sequence="37">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 55 Obicitur etiam: Quod si haec ita se habent, cur ergo Ecclesia moderna non curat practicari poenitentiam pro quolibet peccato mortali ante absolu- tionem ? Ad quam obiectionem respondetur: Ecclesiam in nullo concilio univer- sali aut particulari approbasse praxim absolvendi post confessionem crimi- num, nulla praevie ad absolu tionem facta poenitentia; sed refrigescente paulatim cantate, a tribus aut quatuor saeculis antiquus rigor est relaxatus : ita ut soleat impendi absolutio in confitentibus, de quorum contritione con- fessano sufficienter constat etiam ante impletam poenitentiam, sic tamen ut si non constet de illa sufficienter, etiam nunc absolutio differatur, ut interim magis probetur dispositio poenitentis. Hanc praxim autem pia Mater Ecclesia filiorum infirmitati indulgens tolerat, ita ut nunc simul ac iudicatur poenitens contritus ac poenitentia iniuncta est, communis absolutio impen- datur, et ei Corporis Christi communio tradatur. Quid, dico, poenitentia iniuncta? Sane, quod iam communiter pro gravissimis delictis imponitur, ne nomen quidem poenitentia meretur, quia in eo nihil poenale est. Quinimo tanto horrori nunc est poenitentia, ut si centesima pars poenae, quae a sacris canonibus pro certo delicto olim imponebatur, pro eodem iam imponeretur, forte vix centesimus, ne dicam millesimus confitentium sua peccata, eam acceptaret. Adeo ut non tantum ordo poenitentiae sit inversus, sed pene ipsa poenitentia subversa, et quodammodo evanida nomenque poenitentiae hominibus carnalibus factum odiosum, in nomen confessionis sit mutatum; quam confessionem heretici nostri temporis non sunt veriti appellare carni- ficinam et conscientiarum lanienam, asserentes sufficere propositum novae vitae, ut quis agat poenitentiam ab evangelio praescriptam. Unde non est mirum, quod Ecclesia toleret impendi absolutionem post auditam confessio- nem, et impositam levem poenitentiam ; quia si hoc saeculo corrupto exigeret poenitentiam proportionatam peccatis, et eius impletionem ante absolutio- nem, forsan multi transirent ad partes haereticorum, vel libertinorum, et reiicerent ipsam confessionem. In the context from which the proposition has been pulled, it is to be noted that the author is treating of proportionate penance for sins and not the order of parts. One also observes that the first five words of the condemned proposition are an addition. The last four words, namely, "ordo poenitentiae est inversus" occur in the work of Gabrielis, only the tense of the verb being changed, that is, sit is had in place of est. Therefore, textually the 17th proposition is not completely found in the above text. Before we can judge as to its sense, it will be necessary to investigate for which reasons was it condemned. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT In the opinion of Porter this proposition is contrary to the practice of the Church of absolving those who are rightly disposed before the</page><page sequence="38">56 5. PERA performance of penance. His judgment is found in two places. First of all, in connection with proposition 47 in his list of 105, we read6: Haec et sequentes propositiones usque ad 59 universim pugnant cum communi Theologorum sententia, deinde cum accepta totius Ecclesiae praxi ab aliquot saeculis absolvendi, scilicet, rite dispositos ante impletam poenitentiam, denique cum Constitutione 17 Sixti IV contra Petrum de Osma inter cuius propositiones erat ista: "non peracta poenitentia poeni- tentem absolvi non debere" ubi subdit Constitutio: omnes et singulas pro- positiones praefatas falsas Sanctae Catholicae fidei contrarias erróneas ab evangelica ventate alienas ac manifestam haeresim continere declaramus.7 Secondly, at proposition 54, in the same list is the following8: Haec et sequens per summum nefas impingit errorem Ecclesiae Dei quae tamen in sua praxi universali errare non potest ut notât D. Augustinus, epistola 118 ad Ia.,9 Ecclesia quae sunt contra fidem aut bonam vitam nec tacet nec facit nec approbat. The anti-jansenists, besides presenting a similar criticism, assert another point, namely, the proposition in placing satisfaction before absolution seems to deny the power of the absolution in forgiving sins.

Steyaert, for example, in giving the reason why this proposition merits condemnation, says, if it is admitted that Christ is the author of the order in the sacrament of penance, then the proposition is worthy to be condemned. For, as he says: "Nam alioquin ordinem inter partes poeni- tentiae inverti, qui aliquando in Ecclesia fuit, nihil tantopere mali habere videtur."18 In like manner does the author of Jansenismus plurimas haereses et errores damnatos pertinaciter defendens understand the con- demnation of proposition 17. Le Bachelet,19 treating propositions 16, 17 and 18 together, states that they are false in themselves, injurious to the Church and scandalous in their consequences. For by demanding first the performance of the penance, one would seem to hold that the satisf actio in re is an essential, not integral part of this sacrament. CONCLUSION The anti-jansenists and later authors have condemned the 17th proposition in the first place, because it accuses the Church of error in her practice of immediately absolving those disposed; secondly, because it implies that the order of penance has been established by Christ and hence cannot be changed; and thirdly, because it seems to lessen the power of absolution. Upon re-examining the above text of the Specimina moralis , can it be said that the author admits these errors? Certainly, he does not admit the second and third listed above. Nor does he directly hold the Church has erred. Whether he intends indirectly to accuse the 13 Sabbatini wrote: "cum ipsius liber a supremo hoc tribunali sit pro- scriptas, ab hac propositione iudicanda supersedeo, cum enim totum opus damnatum sit, partem damnari non est opus."

PERA Church of error in her modern practice of absolving a penitent before he makes satisfaction, should not too quickly be admitted. It must be remembered that Gabrielis says the Church, considering the weakness of man, is tolerating the present practice. She realizes if she demanded the strict discipline of the earlier centuries, perhaps many would fall away from their Catholic Faith. It seems that he places no blame on the Church, but rather on the corruption and laxity of the times. We do not so much condemn Gabrielis, whose words "adeo ut non tantum ordo poenitentiae sit inversus" in context can be taken in a correct sense, namely, as merely referring to a past historical fact. We do, however, believe that the anti-jansenists have too readily given these words a jansenistic interpretation.

SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION This proposition, which is found in all the lists of Porter and Duffy,1 is ascribed to the work of Anthony Arnauld, De la fréquente Communion , in the preface, pages 66 and 67. Both Duffy and Porter are clear in citing its French edition and not the Latin translation. It will not be necessary to go into detail concerning the author and his book on communion, since both are well known.2 Nevertheless, a few general remarks are in place.

VIII 59 the last of twenty children of the famous Arnauld family.3 He was ordained a priest in 1641 at the age of 29 years. It was two years later in 1643 that his book on frequent communion was first published at Paris with the title: De la fréquente communion , ou les sentimens des pères, des papes , et des conciles , touchant l'usage des sacremens de pénitence et d'Euchariste , sont fidellement exposez: Pour servir d'adresse aux per- sonnes qui pensent sérieusement à se convertir à Dieu ; et aux Pasteurs et Confesseurs zélés pour le bien des Ames. The long preface of about 150 pages was followed by 16 pages (in the first edition) containing approbations of the book by members of the hierarchy and doctors of theology. Needless to say, the work enjoyed a grand success. Within six months there were already four editions. The first Latin translation was made in 1647 at Paris.4 It was not long before this work became the object of vigorous attack by the anti-jansenists. Strong agitation was being carried on at Rome for its condemnation, which however never took place.6 EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT As mentioned above Porter cites pages 66 and 67 of the preface as the source of our 18th proposition. In the part which precedes, Arnauld is exhorting his readers to become disposed for the reception of the Holy Eucharist by a life of penance, of mortification, of self-denial. In order to arouse such sentiments of mortification he refers to the strict discipline of the early Church as had been expressed in various canons, which had regulated the Christian way of life. He does not intend that the former discipline again be observed in its full rigor, but hopes that the knowledge of this discipline will at the present time lead to a greater spirit of penance and of mortification. His emphasis, therefore, is on various penitential works. 8 His father, also named Anthony (1560 - 1619), was a well-known lawyer in the Assembly of Paris and a Counsellor of State under Henry IV. In 1594 as orator of the University of Paris before the assembly of Paris he delivered an address in which he greatly attacked the Jesuits. 4 I have consulted the following editions : of the French, the first edition at Paris 1643; the second of Paris 1643; the third of Paris 1644; the fourth of Paris 1644; the seventh of Paris 1653, and an edition of Paris 1669. Of the Latin translation I have consulted that of Paris in 1647 and that of Louvain in 1674. 6 On the measures taken to condemn the book of Arnauld, see : REU SCH, Der Index der verbotenen Bücher, vol.

PERA Arnauld, in commenting on part of a sermon which was delivered in the last session of the Council of Trent,6 wished to indicate that it was even the intention of the Fathers of the Council to re-establish the early discipline of the Church in all things and as much as possible. From this paragraph of the sermon, three things, according to Arnauld, should be noted. In the first place the Council of Trent recognized that the discipline of the Church can become corrupted; since such corruption is the source and cause of heresy, there must be a re-establishment of dicipline. Secondly, the bishops of the Council, assuring us that they have regulated everything in as far as it was possible, would have been happy to put things in a state still more perfect. We can best second their intentions, says Arnauld, by always leading the faithful in a way more canonical and more conformed to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. For although that discipline has not been commanded in the following centuries, as it had been in the earlier ones, nevertheless, this discipline has always been approved and even imposed in certain cases, and its traces are still conserved in most of the Church. Thirdly, because of the miserable conditions of the times, the Fathers of the Council of Trent did not change the ecclesiastical discipline to a higher form. Arnauld says under the circumstances what else could the Fathers have done ? It is necessary to admire their wisdom in not obliging all the Christians to the full penance contained in the Canons.' The author indicates that the Fathers turned especially to the priests obliging them to the old canons regarding the purity of their life and morals. For once the clergy is re-established in the way of perfection, it will be easier to restore discipline with the faithful. He explains this last idea as follows: Ainsi parce que le Prestre enferme en soy en éminence toute l'Église, le Concile a jugé avec raison, que c' es toit restablir la discipline en tous les Fidelles, que de la restablir en sa personne, réduisant ainsi toutes les suittes dans le principe d'où elles doivent naistre, et tous les effets dans leurs cause. Ä The title of the sermon is: "Oratio habita in sessione nona et ultima sacri concilii Tridentini celebrata duobus continuis diebus, tertia et quarta decemb. MDLXIII. sub Pio IV. Pont. Max. A.R.P.D.

In his book Arnauld cites the following from this sermon: "Ayant esté obligez de faire deux choses, l'une de défendre la doctrine de la Foy, et l'autre de restablir la discipline de l'Eglise, puis que les Hérétiques asseurent, qu'ils se sont principalement séparez de nous, à cause du dérèglement de la discipline ; nous nous sommes acquittez de nostre charge en l'une et en l'autre, autant qu'il a esté en nostre pouvoir, et que les circonstances de ce temps nous l'ont permis."</page><page sequence="43">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex.

Chrysostome dit excellement, aussi lors qu'il a voulu rétablir dans le Concile de Trente la discipline de son Eglise, dont toutes les choses naturelles civiles ne sont que des figures ; il n'a fait que d'appeller en leur premier esclat, et en leur premiere pureté, les Prestres et les Pasteurs, qui sont la veritable lumiere du monde, et une lumiere qui ne fait pas voir les choses visibles, mais les invisibles, qui sont des sources vivantes, qui ne sortent pas de la Mer, pour retourner dans la Mer, mais qui sortent du Ciel, pour retourner dans le Ciel, qui sont des Roys establis, non par une dignité humaine, mais par la Royauté de Jesus-Christ, et dont les Roys d'Israel n'ont esté que les images, et enfin qui sont les héritiers de ce feu celeste, aussi bien que du Ministere des Apostres, dont ils doivent brûler eux memes, pour fondre la glace des pecheurs, et pour jetter sans cesse de nouvelles flammes dans le coeur des justes. Et certes le Concile nous a bien fait voir, combien l'Eglise se trouve obligée à l'observance des anciens Canons, puis qu'encore qu'au temps qu'il s'assembla, les Ecclésiastiques fussent tombez dans un horrible dérèglement, et que plusieurs choses semblassent alors permises parmi eux, comme estans autorisées, par le grand nombre, et par des personnes mesmes d'une qualité tres-illustre, comme on peut voir dans la Bulle de Pie IV, le Concile neant- mois n'a pas laissé de rappeller tous les anciens Canons, qui avoient esté faits pour les Clercs, les y obligeant sous les mesmes peines, ou sous des peines encore plus grandes, que celles qui ont esté ordonêes dans tous les Conciles pre- cedens;1 nous tesmoignant par cette action, que quelque grand nombre qui s'y oppose, elle veut tousiours qu'ils soient observez, et que lors qu'il intro- duira des coustumes qui leur sont contraires, quand bien elles seroient soûtenues de plusieurs, comme elles estoient alors, et qu'elles eussent deja duré beaucoup d'années, elle ne les tient point pour des usages, mais pour des abus.8 C'est pourquoy le Cardinal Bellarmin soûtient, que la coustume de rompre le jeusne à midy, et de faire une collation sur le soir, n'est que tolerée dans l'Eglise et qu'il y en avoit encore assez de son temps, qui gardoient le jeusne ancien, comme le plus parfait et le veritable. Que si selon cet Auteur celebre, l'Eglise souhaitteroit que l'on jeusnast encore comme autrefois, et ne fait que tolerer le jeusne ordinaire, bien qu'il soit pratique presque universel- lement par tous les Fidelles. Qui ne voit qu'on peut dire par consequent la mesme chose de la Penitence, dont le jeusne est une partie, laquelle n'a 7 In a marginal note is the following: "Eadem in posterům iisdem poenis. vel maioribus arbitrio Ordinarii imponendis, observentur.

Esprit et de l'Eglise. Without a doubt the i8th proposition as it stands in the list of 31 is not found word for word in the above text. The phrase "consuetudo moderna quoad administrationem sacramenti poenitentiae" has been added by the anti-jansenists. Furthermore, they have changed the con- text. It must be kept in mind that in his introduction or preface, Arnauld is speaking not of the sacrament of penance, but of penitential acts to be performed before the reception of Holy Communion. That this is the case, is clear from context. And in the section from which our proposition has been extracted the author claims that to restore discipline in the entire Church, it is necessary to begin with the reform of the clergy. At that time the morals of the clergy had fallen to such a low level that the Council restored all the ancients canons which concerned their life, imposing these canons under the same penalties or greater ones if neces- sary. It was thus the wish of the Church that the ancient canons of clerical discipline be observed. Furthermore, according to Arnauld, when one shall introduce contrary practices, although these would be upheld by many (as was the case then) and they might had endured already for many years, the Church considers them as an abuse and not a legitimate practice. Arnauld himself, who writing after the decree of condemnation, claims that in this particular place he is speaking of canons which regulate the life and morals of the ecclesiastics.9 In the defense of Arnauld is also the brief remark of Sabbatini, namely, "non est apud auctorem."10 We may propose the question: what did the anti-jansenists intend by the expression consuetudo moderna ? After reading the two previous propositions in the list of 31, namely, 16 and 17, it is possible to conclude that the consuetudo moderna refers likewise to the practice of absolving from sins before the performance of the penance. This same conclusion 9 Arnauld writes: "... et que c'est une insigne falsification du Delateur qui l'y a ajouté pour faire croire qu'on y parloit de la coustume qui est aujourd'hui en usage dans l'administration du Sacrement de Penitence, au lieu qu'il n'y est parlé que des Canons pour le règlement de la vie, et des moeurs des Ecclésiastiques."

Moreover, it is expressly affirmed in the comments of Porter and the anti-jansenists, as we shall see later. The inaccuracy of the indicated source for the 18th proposition is suggested by various remarks. After stating this proposition is imputed to Arnauld in the preface pages 66 and 67 of the French edition, Steyaert adds: "neque rursus in mentem eius inquiro."11 Somewhat later in his same commentary, while referring to this proposition as being from the preface of Arnauld's work, he adds the side remark, "recte an secus."12 The author of Jansenismus plurimas haereses et errores damnatos per - tinaciter defendens claims that the words for the most part are taken from Arnauld's preface. Le Bachelet13 gives a similar view, namely, this prop- osition without being literally in the Fréquente Communion has been formed almost entirely from expressions found in its preface on pages 66 and 67. Perhaps, even the silence of Viva,14 who gives no specific ref- erence, may indicate he realized the incertitude of the source indicated for this proposition. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT Although Porter in his brief comment relative to this proposition in his list of 105 merely states that it impiously names a common practice of the Church as an abuse, in the same list at proposition 47 he is more explicit, in writing16: Haec et sequentes propositiones usque ad 59 [thus including our 18th which is n. 57] universim pugnant cum communi theologorum sententia, deinde cum accepta totius Ecclesiae praxi ab aliquot saeculis absolvendi, scilicet, rite dispositos ante impletam poenitentiam, denique cum Constitu- tione 1 7 Sexti IV contra Petrům de Osma inter cuius propositiones erat ista : "non peracta poenitentia poenitentem absolvi non debere" [DENZINGER, n. 728], ubi subdit Constitutio, "omnes et singulas propositiones praefatas 11 STEYAERT, op. cit., p. 358. 12 Ibidem , p. 361. 13 LE BACHELET, op. ctt., col. 757 - 750. 14 VIVA, op. cit., p. 69 - 74.

Diaz, however, in his summary report states that the censure of the majority of theologians was similar to that of the two preceeding propositions, namely, rash, injurious to the Church and vehemently suspected of other defects.17 The various commentators after the publication of the decree as Viva, Steyaert, Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher, in substance agree that the i8th proposition in attacking a legitimate practice of the Church, accuses her of error. Viva and Steyaert, moreover, give a wider inter- pretation. Viva18 claims it may be taken in two ways: i) as we explained 16 The complete text of the judgment of the anti-jansenists is: "Hie iterum accusatur de errore ecclesia, columna veritatis, quae utique errare non potest, et Augustinus epistola ii8 [in the new order it is number 54] ad inquisitiones Ianuarii dicit, insolentissimae insaniae est disputare quin ita faciendum sit , quod tota iam frequentai ecclesia [MIGNE, Patrologia latina, voi. 33, col. 202, cap. 5] ; rursus, sententia Petri de Osma requirentis ut satisfactio seu poenitentia praecedat absolutionem, fuit declarata falsa, erronea, haeretica, adeoque dicere quod moderna consuetudo absolvendi ante impletam poenitentiam sit abusus, est haereticum iuxta censuram Sixti quarti.

VIII 65 above, namely, that the Church considers as an abuse the modern practice of absolving penitents before the satisfaction for sins is complet- ed, which therefore implies omitting the imposition of the canonical penances; 2) the Church condemns as an abuse the modern custom not only of imposing light penances, omitting the more rigid ones of the sacred canons, and of absolving immediately, and without a previous love of God super omnia, and without the most intense contrition, but also of indiscriminately conferring sacramental absolution for venial sins. Steyaert19 writes that the question arises as to the understanding of proposition 18. He says that some wish to limit its interpretation, that is, to understand it as we explained above according to Porter. They argue, he says, from its position in the list of 31. He points out, however, it should be considered as it stands in the context in the work of Arnauld. He concludes, "sermonem in ea (i. e. proposition 18) esse de consuetudine moderna universe , qua Sacramentum illud hodie ad- ministrate;" and in another place, "culpat propositio modum totum collective sumptum, quo hodie poenitentia administratur".20 Viva and Steyaert, therefore, disagree with Porter and Duffy, who at least seem to limit the proposition as referring only to absolution without previous satisfaction. Le Bachelet,21 who treats propositions 16, 17 and 18 to- gether, remarks that they are false in themselves, injurious to the Church and scandalous in their consequences. CONCLUSION From the above, I think it can be said that the 18th proposition was condemned because it accuses the Church of error in her practice of ab- solving from sins before the penance is performed. However it is inter- esting to note that the proposition as it stands is not explicitly found in the passage cited by Porter. Furthermore, Arnauld in the place indicated is not concerned with the sacrament of penance, but penitential works, acts of mortification and self-denial. The over eager anti-jansenists, however, by an addition to the text of Arnauld, have read therein that which they desired.22 19 1. c. 20 Ibidem, p. 388. 21 1. c. 22 We cannot agree with the following statement: cette Proposition (i. e. 18) se trouve très-clairement exprimée dans la Préface du Livre de la Fréquente Communion p. 67."

PERA VII PROPO SITIO 22 : Sacrilegi sunt iudicandi, qui ius ad communionem per- cipiendam praetendunt, antequam condignam de de- lictis suis poenitentiam egerint. SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION Porter, as well as Duffy, cite the Specimina mor alts, p. 13g of Giles Gabrielis as the source for the 22nd proposition.1 This is therefore the second proposition in the list of the 31 which is attributed to this work.2 In Porter's list of 105, this proposition is found with two others in the section titled, "propositiones concernentes frequentationem Sacrae Communionis." A few preliminary observations are in place with regard to our 22nd proposition. First of all, it states that those are to be judged sacrilegious who claim the right to receive Holy Communion before performing proportionate penance for their sins. It must be noted that it does not merely state, in the circumstances expressed, those are to be judged sacrilegious after the reception of the Holy Eucharist, but those are guilty who claim a right to receive Holy Communion. A fortiori, then, they are culpable who actually partake of this Holy Sacrament. Secondly, although the use of the word delictis implies serious crimes, the expression condigna poenitentia is ambiguous both concerning its quality and quantity. Judging from the background of the times, however, it is known that some advocated satisfaction to endure for weeks and months. Finally, the entire last part of the proposition, namely, "antequam condignam de delictis suis poenitentiam egerint/ ' is not exactly clear. It can be taken in three ways. In the first place, it may be thus under- stood: those are to be judged sacrilegious, who having confessed their sins and received absolution , assert their right to receive Holy Communion before performing the imposed(?) penance. In other words, then, this condemned proposition would require that after receiving absolution from mortal sins, it is necessary to perform the sacramental ( ?) penance before 1 This proposition is found with Duffy: under n. 141 of the Theologia Baio-ianseniana, part three; n. 276 of the 356 propositions; n. 80 of the 96 propositions; with Porter: under n. 181 of the 238 propositions; n. 68 of the 105 propositions. Gabrielis is also cited as the source by: Steyaert, Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher, Torrecilla, Le Bachelet. The author of Jansenismus plurimas haereses et errores damnatos pertinaciter defendens says it is accord- ing to the mind of Arnauld. 2 As we have already seen, proposition 17 is also attributed to Giles Gabrielis.</page><page sequence="49">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 67 going to Holy Communion. Still, another way of interpreting this last phrase is, that those are to be judged sacrilegious, who claim the right to receive the Eucharist, after having confessed their sins, nevertheless, are refused absolution , and consequently Holy Communion (even though they may be sufficiently disposed), until the sacramental^ ?) penance is performed. A third possibility may be that of Arnauld (cfr. above in our treatment of proposition 18), namely, before receiving the Holy Eucha- rist one should prepare himself by various voluntary (?) acts of morti- fication and self-denial. It is in the second sense, however, that we should understand the last part of the 22nd proposition. For in the period of history under consideration there was a rigoristic element in the Church which advocat- ed the deferment of absolution and reception of the Body and Blood of Christ, until sufficient penance was performed. This interpretation of the phrase will also be evident after considering the text of the Speci - mina moralis and the notations of the anti-jansenists. EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT We now proceed to examine the source of our proposition, namely, the Specimina moralis of Gabrielis. Paragraph 39 (p. 127 - 140) bears the title: "Rat iones quae moverunt Sanctos Patres ad exigendam poeniten- tiae impletionem ante absolutionem sacramentalem." Four reasons are indicated. The fourth reason, however, which begins on page 138, is the one of interest to us. The text of the author is: Quarta ratio, quae movit Sanctos Patres ad differendam absolutionem est praeparatio ad Eucharistiam, de qua supra. Unde Ambrosius in Psalmum 118 in haec verba: "Miserere mei, secundum eloquium tuum," ait: "In ipsa Ecclesia ubi maxime misereri decet, teneri quam maxime debet forma iustitiae, ne quis a Communionis consortio abstentus, brevi lachrymula, atque ad tempus parata, vel etiam uberioribus fletibus communionem, quam plurimis debet postulare temporibus, facilitate Sacerdotis extorqueat."8 Et quia soient peccatores urgere Confessarios suos, ipsisque irasci, dum eis absolutionem et communionem negant, donec condignam delictis suis poenitentiam egerint, dicit Cyprianus de lapsis [reference is given below] : Vis infertur Corpori eius (nempe Christi) et Sanguini. Quod non statim Domini Corpus inquinatis manibus accipiat, aut ore polluto Domini Sangui- nem bibat, sacerdotibus sacrilegus irascitur. Quid coeci oculi poenitentiae iter non vident, quod ostendimus ? Et Clerus Romanus ad Cyprianum Epist. 31 . . . Textually, the 22nd proposition is not found in the Specimina moralis , p. 13g. We do, however, discover one phrase that resembles part of our 3 MIGNE, Patrologia latina , vol. 15, col. 1374, par. 26. 5*</page><page sequence="50">68 5. PERA proposition, that is, ' 'donee condignam delictis suis poenitentiam egerint" of the text, with "antequam condignam de delictis suis poenitentiam egerint" of the condemned proposition. The first part of the proposition, "sacrilegi sunt iudicandi, qui ius ad communionem percipiendam prae- tendunt" obviously has been extracted from the sentence in the Speci - mina moralis , "Quod non statim Domini Corpus inquinatis manibus accipiat, aut ore polluto Domini Sanguinem bibat, sacerdotibus sacri- legus irascitur." If one carefully notices the original text of Gabrielis, something interesting will be observed. The sentence "Quod non statim . . . iras- citur," just as the preceding, "vis infertur etc.," and likewise, "quid coeci oculi etc.," have all been copied verbatim from the De lapsis of St. Cy- prian.4 However, in the De lapsis these sentences are not joined as they are in the text of Gabrielis. Upon examining the Patrologia latina edited by Migne, vol. IV, it will be noticed that the first sentence occurs in the De lapsis under number 16, col. 493: "Spretis his omnibus at que con- temptis, ante expiata delieta, ante exomologesin factam criminis, ante purgatam conscientiam sacrificio et manu sacerdotis, ante offensam placatam indignantis Domini et minantis, vis infertur corpori et san- guini, et plus modo in Dominum manibus atque ore delinquunt quam cum Dominum negaverunt . . The second sentence is found under number 22, col. 498: "... Tumens animus et superbus nec quia victus est, fractus est. Iacens stantibus et integris vulneratus miratur, et quod non statim Domini corpus inquinatis manibus accipiat, aut ore polluto Domini sanguinem bibat, sacerdotibus sacrilegus irascitur. Atque, o tuam nimiam, furiose, dementiam! irasceris ei qui abs te avertere iram Dei nititur . . and the third under number 23, col. 498: "Accipe potius et admitte quae loquimur. Quid surdae aures salutaria praecepta non audiunt quae monemus? quid caeci oculi poenitentiae iter non vident quod ostendimus? quid perculsa et alienata mens remedia vitalia non percipit quae de Scripturis coelestibus et discimus et docemus? . . It is true that Gabrielis expressly states he is quoting from the De lapsis of St. Cyprian. However, let us remember that practice which even was used in the 17th century, namely, a writer, would not always indicate his citations with quotation marks or italics. Thus it happened that the particular unknown anti-jansenist, who formulated the 22nd prop- 4 "Nel sec. Ill furono chiamati lapsi quei cristiani che durante la per- secuzione de Decio (250) apostatarono dalla fede/' Cfr. F. CARPINO, LAPSI , controversia dei , in Enciclopedia Cattolica, Città del Vaticano 1951» voi. VII, col. 909 - 913.</page><page sequence="51">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 69 osition, blundered by not reading far enough into the De lapsis. He unfortunately attributed the actual words of St. Cyprian to Gabrielis. It is likewise to be noted that Gabrielis in the sentence introducing the citation from St. Cyprian uses the word peccatores , which certainly is not as strong as the sacrilegus of the De lapsis. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT A summary of Porter's observation connected with this proposition may be reduced to the following points5: 1) this proposition condemns the practice of the Church; 2) it is contrary to the Council of Trent, which merely requires that he who is guilty of mortal sin must first go to confession before receiving the Blessed Sacrament; 3) the pro- position places an obstacle to annual communion to say nothing at all of a daily participation of the Sacred Banquet. The observations of the anti-jansenists6 substantially are the same as those of Porter, with only more detailed explanations of the various points. An addition, however, is the reference to Peter de Osma, and also to the impossibility of the dying to communicate. The complete text is as follows: Haec propositio accedit ad damnatam a Sixto quarto Petri de Osma sententiam requirentem ut impleatur prius poenitentia quam conferatur absolutio;7 deinde, impingit in Tridentino, sessione 13, cap. 7® declarans quae praeparatio sit tantum necessaria ad eucharistiam sumendam.

To be noted is the following: "suscipiens reverenter ad minus in Pascha Eucharistiae sacramentum, nisi forte de Consilio proprii sacerdotis ob aliquam rationabilem causam ad tempus ab eius perceptione duxerit abstinendum." 10 Ibidem, n. 891.</page><page sequence="52">70 S. PERA The theological faculty of Louvain11 passed no specific judgment on this proposition for it believed Gabrielis himself had already sent his answers to Rome. The consultors of the Holy Office12 apparently had some difficulty in interpreting this proposition. Their judgments, ranging from temerarious to near heresy, are as follows: Sabbatinus18 dixit propositionem non habere auctorem, sed esse teme- rariam et scandalosam; Bianchi: nullam mereri censuram theologicam si intelligatur de iis qui tale ius ad communionem percipiendam praetendunt ut ab Ecclesiae ministris numquam arceri possent a Sacra Communione non peracta condigna satis- f actione ; Dominicus a S. Trinitate dixit quod promeretur easdem censuras qualis propositio quod absolutio non est concedenda nisi peracta poenitentia; Esparza: esse temerariam, perniciosam, gravissime iniuriosam ad versus Ecclesiam Catholicam et vehementer suspecta de haeresi; Madernus: esse temerariam, iniuriosam, et de haeresi suspectam; Fabri dixit esse erroneam et opponi Concilio Tridentino; Commissarius : dixit esse erroneam et temerariam; Magister: esse erroneam, immo forte haeresi proximam vel sapientem haeresim per Buliam Sixti IV cui videtur directe opponi, saltem in aliquocasu. Later around the year 1689, Francis Diaz14 in summarizing the judgments of the consultors merely states that the 22nd proposition was judged to be temerarious, erroneous, scandalous and suspected of greater malice. Viva,15 Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher,16 and Steyaert17 seek the basis on which the proposition rests. Thus according to Viva it is based on one of two errors : a) that the one rightly disposed to receive the Sacrament of Penance is never able to be absolved, and consequently does not have the right to receive Holy Communion, unless he first makes suitable satisfaction; or b) sin is not remitted by absolution unless the satisfaction precedes. Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher gives a similar judgment, and Steyaert says perhaps the proposition is based on the fact that formerly only through various stages of penance would one be allowed to approach the Holy Table, or based on a custom of the Greeks, i. e., to communicate only after having received absolution and performed the penance. 11 Cfr. ludi cium facultatis theologicae Lovaniensis super ç6 propositiones hie iniunctis, at propositionem 80, ms. 1343, Rome, Biblioteca Nazionale, Fondo Gesuitico. 12 See Killinev P aber s, ms.

CONCLUSION Our 22nd proposition as it stands is certainly not clear. The phrase, "antequam condignam de delictis suis poenitentiam egerint," may be interpreted in three ways. Moreover, textually it is not in the work of Gabrielis. It was fabricated by an anti-jansenist who in all probability did not realize he was extracting it from the words of St. Cyprian. VIII PROPOSITIO 23 : Similiter arcendi sunt a sacra communione, quibus nondum inest amor Dei purissimus et omnis mixtionis expers. SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION Both Duffy and Porter agree in citing the De la fréquente Communion of Anthony Arnauld as the source of the 23rd proposition.1 This is therefore the second in the list of 31 that is claimed by Porter to have been extracted from this well-known book. Since we have already con- sidered both the author and his work in our treatment of the 18th prop- osition, we shall at once pass to the examination of the context. EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT We are not concerned with the Latin translation, but with the French edition (as Porter and Duffy testify),2 part one, chapter four. It is to be recalled that this book of Arnauld is a reply to the work of Pierre des Sesmaisons, S.J.: Question , s'il est meilleur de communier souvent que rarement ?3 In the fourth chapter, as in many others, after first quoting a passage from the treatise of Sesmaisons, Arnauld presents his response. 18 LE BACHELET, op. cit., col. 759. 1 This proposition is found with Duffy: under n. 143 of the Theologia Baio-ianseniana, part three; n. 278 of the 356 propositions; it is not found in his list of 96 propositions; with Porter: under n. 183 of the 238 propo- sitions; n. 69 of the 105 propositions. 2 Duffy expressly mentions the French edition in his Theologia Baio- ianseniana, part 3 at proposition 143. Porter gives the same reference in his list of 238 at proposition 183. 3 Cfr. SOMMERVOGEL, Bibliothèque de la Compagnie de Jésus, vol. VII, Brussels 1896, col. 1158.</page><page sequence="54">72 S. PERA The title of the fourth chapter proposes the question - according to St. Dionysius who are they who merit to assist at Holy Mass ? There follows the quotation from Sesmaisons in which the Jesuit by citing early authorities wishes to indicate that those present at Mass are also to receive Holy Communion. Among other things Sesmaisons mentions Sts. Clement and Dionysius,4 disciples of the Apostles, as testifying that after the Gospel and the reading of Sacred Scripture, those who were not disposed to receive the Eucharist were sent out, and the priest having distributed Holy Communion to all, completed the Sacred Mysteries with thanksgiving. In his response Arnauld indicates that if Sesmaisons had understood the true spirit of the discipline of the early church, he would not have appealed to it in support of his views. Instead he would have recognized that it is destructive of what he holds. Thus, for example, as mentioned above, the Jesuit said that according to Sts. Clement|and Dionysius after the reading of Holy Scripture, those not disposed to receive the Eucharist were dismissed, and the priest then distributed the Sacred Species to all present. Arnauld raises the question - of what use is it to say that before the celebration of the Holy Mysteries all those not disposed to communicate were dismissed, if it is not clarified who are those judged not disposed? Arnauld proceeds in a rhetorical manner. He lists several classes of people, among which, he says, Sesmaisons counsels frequent communion and an immediate reception of the Eucharist. Concerning all these various groups, Arnauld states that if it's discovered that these were judged not disposed to communicate, and if these groups coincide with those dismissed from the sacrifice, the conclusion is that those whom the Jesuit admits (even pushes) to frequent Communion, ought not even to be present at the Holy Sacrifice. Arnauld says that he does not wish that 4 By Dionysius the Areopagite is usually understood the judge of the Areopagus, who was converted to Christianity by the preaching of St. Paul. (Cfr. Acts of the Apostles , chapter 17, verse 22 ff.) In the course of time, however, two errors arose in connection with this name. In the first place, a series of famous writings of a rather peculiar nature was ascribed to the Areopagite, and secondly, he was popularly identified with the martyr of Gaul, Dionysius, the first bishop of Paris. The works of St. Dionysius were well esteemed in the Church. In the 15th century, however, Laurentius Valla (1407 - 1457) raised the doubt as to their genuine author. Two camps were formed. The defenders of St. Dionysius included such men as Baronius, Bellarmine, Lansselius, Cordier, Halloix, Delrio, de Rubeis, Lessius, Alexan- der Natalis etc. It was in the 19th century that the general opinion inclined more and more against the authorship of St. Dionysius.

IV, Città del Vaticano 1950, col. 1662 - 1668.</page><page sequence="55">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 73 his own words be believed, but the words of one of the witnesses referred to by Sesmaisons. He then presents a citation from the De Ecclesiastica Hier ar chia y chapter 3 of St. Dionysius,5 from which it then appears evident that Arnauld's prior classification is based on this passage of the Saint. In other words, expressed more briefly and simply, in this fourth chapter of part one, Arnauld has presented a text from St. Dionysius in which the saint lists several groups of those to be excluded from assisting at Holy Mass beyond the point of the Mass of the Catechumens. Among this number, according to Arnauld, is found those whom Ses- maisons advises frequent communion and an immediate reception of Communion. Therefore, how is it possible that these receive Holy Com- munion, if they cannot even be present at the Sacred Mysteries? We now present the complete response of Arnauld which comprises the fourth chapter of part one: Si vous aviez bien compris l'esprit véritable de cette sainte Discipline, qui s'observoit à la naissance de l'Eglise, non seulement vous vous seriez abstenu de la rapporter comme vous étant favorable, mais vous auriez facilement reconnu qu'il ne se peut rien concevoir qui soit plus contraire à vos maximes, et qui ruine davantage toutes vos prétentions. Car que sert-il de nous dire qu'avant la celebration des misteres, on chassoit tous ceux qui n'étoient pas disposez à recevoir l'Eucharistie, si vous ne nous enseignez qui étoient ceux qu'ils n'y jugeoient pas disposez ? Et s'il se trou voit qu'ils eussent mis de ce nombre, non seulement ceux qui ne font profession de vivre vertueusement, (à qui néanmoins vous conseillez la fréquente communion, ainsi que je le ferai voir) ; mais ceux-memes qui étoient une fois tombez de l'état d'une vie sainte et chrétienne, quoi qu'ils eussent dessein d'y rentrer: Non seulement ceux, qui portant à la hâte aux pieds d'un Prêtre leurs habitudes enracinées, et leurs crimes encore tout vivans, doivent, selon vous, être aussi-tôt admis à l'Eucharistie, mais ceux-même qui s' étant déjà retirez de la vie contraire à la vertu , ne sont pas encore purifiez des images qui leur restent, de leurs déreglemens passez: Non seulement ceux, qui sont remplis de l'amour d'eux-mêmes, mais aussi ceux qui n'ont pas encore l'amour divin, pur et sans aucun mélange: Non seulement ceux, qui sont si attachez au monde 5 T^e De Ecclesiastica Hier ar chia treats of the nature and grades of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. After an introduction which discusses God's purpose in establishing the hierarchy of the Church and which pictures Christ as its holy and supreme Head, Dionysius deals with the three sacraments of Bap- tism, Holy Eucharist and Extreme Unction; then the three grades of the Teaching Church (bishops, priests, deacons) ; three grades of the "Learning Church," that is, monks, people and the class composed of catechumens, energumens and penitents; lastly, he considers the burial of the dead. The main purpose of the author is to disclose and turn to the use of contemplation the deeper mystical meaning which underlies the sacred rites, ceremonies, institutions and symbols. Cfr. B. STEIDLE, Patrologia seu historia antiquae litteraturae ecclesiasticae, Friburgi Brisgoviae IQ37, p. 208.</page><page sequence="56">74 5. PERA que de merveille; mais tous ceux, qui ne sont pas encore parfaitement unis à Dieu seul, et entièrement irreprochables. Si /dis- je, il se rencontrait que toutes ces personnes eussent été chassées du sacrifice, cette sainte Discipline feroit-elle voir autre chose, sinon que ceux que nous admettez, ou plutôt que vous poussez à la frequente participation des misteres ; ne devroient pas seulement y assister, selon le sentiment de ces grands Saints, que vous confessez avec tous les Catholiques au commen- cement de^ce discours, nous de voit servir de regle. Je ne desire pas que vous m'en croyez, mais écoutons tous deux vos propres témoins; et principalement celui d'entre eux qui vous en peut le mieux informer, comme étant le seul qui ait écrit particulièrement de ces choses. Le grand saint Denis déclare ce que vousra portez, qu'après l'Evangile, et la lecture des saintes lettres, ceux qui n'étoient pas disposez à recevoir l'Eucharistie, étoient mis dehors: mais parce que vous avez oublié de nous dire quels étoient ces gens-là que l'on mettoit hors de l'Eglise, il faut que ses paroles vous l'apprenent; Ouvrez donc les yeux et les oreilles du coeur, et voyez si vous pourrez soûtenir la splendeur de ces éclairs; et le bruit de ce tonnerre. "On chasse," dit il,6 "ceux que je m'en vay vous nommer du temple de Dieu, et du sacrifice, comme étant trop sublime et trop élevé pour eux. Premièrement, ceux qui n'ont pas encore été instruits, ni recûs à la partici- pation^des misteres," c'est-à-dire, les Catechumenes, "Secondement, ceux qui sont tombez de l'état d'une vie sainte et Chrétienne," c'est-à-dire, ceux qui ont perdu la grâce de leur baptême en commettant quelque peché mortel. "En troisième lieu, ceux que leur propre foiblesse rend susceptibles de terreurs et de visions, que leur cause l'impression de l'ennemi," c'est-à-dire, les éner- gumenes, "comme n'étant pas encore parvenus à cette immobilité, pour dire ainsi, et à cette vigueur toû jours agissante de l'habitude divin et deifiante par une application constante, et invincible aux choses de Dieu. Quatrième- ment, ceux qui à la vérité se sont bien déjà retirez de la vie contraire à la vertu," c'est-à-dire les pénitens, "mais qui ne sont pas encore purifies des phantômes et des images qui leur restent de leurs dérèglements passez, par une habitude, et par un amour divin, pur, et sans aucun mélange. Et enfin, ceux qui ne sont pas encore parfaitement unis à Dieu seul, et pour user des termes de l'Ecriture, ceux qui ne sont pas entièrement parfaits, et entièrement irreprochables . ' ' Cette doctrine est-elle conforme à la vôtre ? Et si ce grand Saint avoit prevû tous vos excès, et tous les desordres que vous voulez établir, (comme l'esprit qui l'animoit les prévoyoit bien) les auroit-il pû étouffer avec des paroles plus pressantes? There axe two places in the text above which sound somewhat similar to the 23rd proposition. First of all, toward the beginning, in the classi- fication given by Arnauld is had: "mais aussi ceux 'qui n'ont pas encore 6 In a marginal note is: "De Ecclesiastica Hier ar chia, cap. 3". Cfr. MIGNE, Patrologia graeca, vol. 3, col. 436.</page><page sequence="57">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 75 l'amour divin , pur et sans aucun mélange .Secondly, toward the end of the chapter in the citation from St. Dionysius and upon which Arnauld based his classification, one reads : mais qui ne sont pas encore purifiez des phantômes et des images qui leur restent de leurs dêreglemens passez , par une habitude , et par un amour divin , pur , et sans aucun mélange. Thus it is evident that part of the condemned proposition has been formed from a citation of St. Dionysius. Upon comparing the wording of the 23rd proposition with the text of Arnauld, we note various differences. In the first place, we do not find in the Fréquente Communion the phrase, "similiter arcendi sunt a sacra communione." Secondly, where the text has the positive form of the adjective pure , the proposition gives the superlative, purissimus. It is true, however, that in the Latin translation of Arnaulďs work, we read in the place relative to his divisions: "non ii solum 'qui sui ipsorum amore pleni sint,' sed ii etiam 'qui divinum amorem ab omni alieno affectu purum ac liberum nondum assecuti sunt';" then afterwards in the citation from St. Dionysius we read: "sed ánimos a pristinae impuritatis phantasmatis nondum satis expurgatos gerunt habitu amor eque Dei purissimo ac simplici." At the time of Arnauld there already existed many Latin translations which he could have consulted.7 Even Migne, who uses the edition of Balthasar Cordier, S.J.,8 gives the superlative form, namely, "nondum tamen a visis habitu amoreque divino eoque puríssimo purgati sunt."9 There can be no doubt that the words of the 23rd proposition "quibus nondum inest amor Dei purissimus et omnis mixtionis expers" are based on the words of St. Dionysius, and presented by Arnauld as "un amour divin, pur et sans aucun mélange." Likewise, there is no doubt that according to St. Dionysius those without such a love (xai spam &lt;9-eícp xai á(xiy£L) should not participate ini what we call today, the 7 Ibidem , col. 51 ff., where the various editions are given. 8 Cfr. SOMMERVOGEL, op. cit., vol. II, col. 1438 - 1442. * lne rlorilegium ťatnsticum , lasciculus 7, part o, 1937 uses tne same edition as Migne. In some of the editions of the Fréquent Communion the entire citation of St. Dionysius is printed in Greek in the margin. Concerning the phrase which concerns our proposition we read: oí&gt;7tco 8è xai tõv (pavraaícov aÒT7)ç IÇev xal ěpam &amp;eí&lt;») xai á^tyei xa&amp;ap&amp;évTeç. Thus Dionysius speaks of those who have not yet been cleansed by love which is divine and genuinely so, by saying than the love is analloyed, ajxiyet a common Greek word meaning not mixed with dross. In the German translation which is better than the Latin, is had: "aber noch nicht durch eine göttliche und lautere innere Verfassung und Liebe von den Phantasiebildern des früheren Lebens gereinigt sind . . Cfr. Bibliothek der Kirchenväter, Des heiligen Dionysius Areopagita Angebliche Schriften über die beiden Hierarchen.</page><page sequence="58">76 5. PERA Mass of the Faithful. In the fourth chapter Arnauld merely draws the logical conclusion, namely, if these, according to the De Ecclesiastica Hierarchia are to be dismissed after the reading of Sacred Scripture, they have been judged unworthy to receive Holy Communion. Before considering the doctrinal judgment of our 23rd proposition, let us review the various comments of the authors relative to this de- pendence. In other words, what were the various reactions or explana- tions^given concerning the relation between our 23rd proposition and the text of St. Dionysius ? We find two commentators who give no explicit mention of the Saint. Viva10 merely refers to the innovators who adhere to the errors of Baius. Le Bachelet,11 treating propositions 22 and 23 together, in the beginning does refer to our part one, chapter four. Afterwards he says these two propositions do not represent the exact words of Arnauld, but they are conclusions made from many passages where he relates and interprets the ancient discipline. He then gives various vague references which offer no substantial support to his statements. Next we have those commentators who refer to St. Dionysius. Sabba- tini has the note12: "non est apud auctorem, qui refert sententiam S. Dionisii, et si non (!) est S. Dionisii, non est censurabilis." Gerberon13 claims this proposition, excluding the word purissimus is entirely of St. Dionysius, who was most esteemed in the earlier Councils. He con- tinues in saying that Arnauld, purely and simply, without addition or substraction has set forth the words of this Saint. Steyaert,14 likewise admitting the dependence on St. Dionysius, adds that the words of the saint, however, are to be understood as a sincere love of God from a pure heart, a good conscience and a genuine faith. As it happens frequently, Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher16 is perfect in avoiding the issue and adds only confusion. It seems that he purposely refrains from mentioning part one, chapter four of Arnaulds' work. Instead, he refers the reader to part three chapter seven where Arnauld treats of the fruitful disposition 10 VIVA, op. cit., p. 85. 11 LE BACHELET, op. cit., col. 759. In the same place he gives a reference to the preface of Arnauld' s work, p. 24. I think this is an error which Le Bachelet carried over from Steyaert who also mentions the preface page 24. Most probably he is confusing this notation with that of the 18th proposition which was from the preface, p. 66 and 67. 12 Rome, Bibliotheca Angelica, ms. 899, fol. 259 V. 13 GERBERON, Quaestio iuris pontificii . . ., p. 11 and 17. 14 STEYAERT, op. cit., p. 365 - 367. 16 Although Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher does refer to part 1, chapter 5, he makes no mention of St. Dionysius in this place. Later when producing the French, he is sure to add the superlative, thus: "un amour tres pur, et sans aucun mélange."</page><page sequence="59">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 77 necessary for frequent communion, and in citing the testimony of various Fathers, he reproduces again the paragraph from St. Dionysius. Hilary's interpretation and explanations of the relation between passages are often rash and without foundation. Arnauld16 himself, writing after the decree of condemnation, claims that the proposition is a falsification and is not found either in his work or in that of St. Dionysius. He then explains that the ideas of this saint are similar to those expressed by St. Francis de Sales17 in his tract on the love of God ; and adds that the love required in the proposition is not found on earth, but only among the blessed in heaven.18 DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT In his remarks relative to our 23rd proposition Porter appeals to St. Cyril of Alexandria and to the Council of Trent.19 He writes: S. Cyrillus Alexandrinus lib. 8 in Ioanne cap. 1720: "probo meipsum et indignum invenio, quando igitur quicumque tu es qui ista dicis, dignus eris ? Sedat cum in nobis maneat Christus saevientem membrorum nostrorum legem et Trid. sess. 13; cap. 2, 21 ait: Eucharistiam esse antidotum contra culpas quotidianas. The anti-jansenists in their criticism, also as Porter, find that the proposition is contrary to the Council of Trent, session 13, chapter 2, 22 16 Cfr. L. WILLAERT, Bibliotheca janseniana Belgica, 5500. 17 Among other things, on the love of God St. Francis de Sales says: "It is a love which must prevail over all our loves, and reign over all our passions. And this is what God requires of us - that among all our loves his be the dearest, holding the first place in our hearts ; the warmest, occupy- ing our whole soul ; the most general, employing all our powers ; the highest, filling our whole spirit; and the strongest, exercising all our strength and vigour. And inasmuch as by this we choose and elect God for the sovereign object of our soul, it is love of sovereign election, or an election of sovereign love ... For as God is the only Lord, his goodness is infinitely above all goodness, and he is to be loved with a love which is eminent, excellent and mighty beyond all comparison. It is this supreme love which places God in such esteem in our souls, and makes us repute it so great a happiness to be agreeable in his sight, that we prefer him and love him above all things . .

Moreover, this proposition wishes that the effects which are had from Holy Communion be placed before its reception.23 The examiners of the Holy Office, realizing the errors inherent in the proposition, judged it in the following manner24: Sabbatinus: esse temerariam; Bianchi: esse omnino improbabilem et temerariam; Dominicus a S. Trinitate: esse temerariam, animarum perturbativam, scandalosam et erroneam; Esparza: esse ineptam, scandalosam et erroneam; Madernus : esse scandalosam, temerariam, erroneam, sapientem haeresim et contra Tridentinum; Fabri: revocativam a Sacramento Eucharistiae ; Commissarius : esse erroneam, scandalosam et iniuriosam Sacramento Eucharistiae; Magister: esse periculosam et male sonantem et errori proximam. Of the commentators after the decree of condemnation, we are especially concerned with Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher and Viva. Hi- lary,26 very rashly and without foundation, carries over the idea of sacrilege from the 22nd proposition to this one. He bases his inference on the first word of proposition 23, namely, "similiter arcendi sunt, etc.," - an inference which would be valid if both of these propositions were found in the same work and one following the other. Hilary boldly claims that there is no doubt that the sense of the 23rd proposition is that those without so great a love and perfection ought to be prohibited as guilty of sacrilege from the reception of the Holy Sacrament. Viva,26 likewise connects the 22nd and 23rd propositions thus introd- ucing the notion of sacrilege into the latter. He goes yet further by basing our 23rd proposition on Baianistic principles. Thus he proceeds : all these innovators think that every love which is not of God propter se 23 Their full comment is as follows: Quasi vero non suiticeret attritio ex metu gehennae cum sacramento, qualis secundum Trid. sess. 14. cap. 4 [D ENZIN GER, n. 898] utpote donum Dei et Spiritus Sancti impulsus, peccatorem in sacramento poenitentiae ad gratiam impetrandam disponit; rursus, numquam liceret suscipere eucharistiam donee habetur ille amor tam purus, qualis nonnisi in magnis sanctis et in gratia confirmatis reperiri potest, deinde, Trid. sess. 13, cap. 2 [D ENZIN GER, n. 875] declarat esse antidotum quo liberemur a culpis quotidianis, et a peccatis mortalibus praeservemur, vult autem dicta propositio ut hi effectus qui habentur ex eucharistia prae- cedant earn, dum requirit amorem Dei purissimum et omnis mixtionis ex- pertem/' See, Propositiones 105 Apostolicae Sedi exhibitae . . ., ms. 1343; Roma, Biblioteca Nazionale, Fondo Gesuitico.

VIII 79 and supernatural, is a vicious cupidity and a sin (as is had in proposition 38 of Baius) ;27 and every human deliberate act, which is not of the love of God and the charity of the Father, is the love of the world and the concupiscence of the flesh, and thus bad (as in proposition 7 of the 31). 28 Consequently, according to these innovators, Viva says, the love which is not the purest and without mixture, involves a fault, which renders the eating of the Eucharistie Food a sacrilege. According to Le Bachelet29 this proposition is rash, scandalous, deprecatory of the sacrament of the Eucharist (such as it is usually administered in the Church), and unjurious to the Church itself. CONCLUSION The anti-jansenists have correctly asserted that our 23rd proposition is contrary to the teaching of the Church, and places an obstacle to frequent Communion. However, they have recklessly asserted it is found in the Fréquent Communion of Anthony Arnauld. Thus in our list of 31 this is the second proposition claimed by the anti-jansenists to be of Arnauld. It is true that some have even attributed the 16th to him.30 Nevertheless, as we have ^already indicated, Porter in his official list cites the source as: Cánones poenitentiales a S. Carolo Borromaeo ex antiquis poenitentialibus collecti , quibus praemittitur com- pendiosa deductio in cognitionem originisy vigoris, et declinationis dictorum canonum. There have been some authors who exaggerated the number ;^of propositions attributed to Arnauld. Hurt er31 for example, writes^' 'et Alexander VIII damnavit plures quae in eo (i. e. libro Arnaldi) continen- tur propositiones 20 dec. 1690." Patouillet32 in his work Dictionnaire des livres jansénistes . . . thus asserts: "En 1690 plusieurs propositions qui étoient extraites du Livre de la Fréquente Communion, furent flétries par le Décret d'Alexandre VIII, du 20 Décembre/' If Reusch33 writes that according to the Jesuits the 16th, 18th and 23rd propositions have been extracted from the Fréquent Communion , he adds that Arnauld in his work Difficultez proposées à M. Steyaert has proven the contrary. 27 D ENZINGER, n. 1038. 28 Ibidem, n. 1297. 29 1. c. 30 For Arnauld's reply cfr., Neuvième partie des difficultez proposées à M. Steyaert . . .

PERA IX PROPO SITIO 25: Dei Patris [Viva: sedentis] simulacrum nefas est christi- ano in tempio collocare. SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION Both Duffy and Porter1 agree in ascribing this proposition to John Hessels, Doctor of Louvain, in his Catechism , book 3, chapter 64. Hessels,2 who was born in Louvain in 1522, embraced the ecclesiastical state and zealously applied himself to the study of theology. For eight years he taught sacred theology to the young religious of the abbey of Pare, located near Louvain. At the University of Louvain he obtained a chair of theology in 1559 and was also a canon of the chapter of St. Peter. All of his duties were fulfilled with zeal and success. In 1562 Pius IV announced the re-opening of the Council of Trent, which had already been suspended on two occasions. Hessels and his friend Michael Baius3 were sent to the Council, since their doctrine was under suspicion. After returning to Louvain, Hessels occupied himself with teaching and writing. He was a fierce opponent of the errors of Protestantism, as is evident from his writings. The work which is of interest to us is his Catechism , first published at Louvain in 1571 by Henry Van Grave.4 Rather than being a simple exposition of catholic faith, it is a remarkable treatise of dogmatic and moral theology based on the Fathers and especially on St. Augustine. This catechism treats of the Apostles' Creed, the Our Father, Hail Mary, Ten Commandments and the first three Sacraments. Before completing the tract on the last four Sacraments the author^died on November 7, 1566. Others, however, from notes of Hessels, added this section to later editions. It is claimed that some infiltrations of baianism were eliminated by Henry Van Grave, the first editor. 1 This proposition is tound m tne following places : witn uuiiy, m nis Theologia Baio-ianseniana, part 3, n. 160; among the 356 propositions, n. 298; among the 96 propositions, n. 87; with Porter: among the 238 prop- ositions, n. 205; among the 105 propositions, n. 74. 2 Cfr.

VIII 8l EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT The edition of the Catechism which we consulted is divided into two volumes. The first volume, which is of interest to us, has the following title : Catechismus solidam et orthodoxam continens explicationem symboli apostolici, orationis dominicae, salutationis angelicae, praeceptorum decalogi et priorům trium sacramentorum auctore Ioanne Hesselio Lovaniensi sacrae theologiae Doctore et Professore Regio, editio septima cui ad calcem sub- nectitur eiusdem Censura super legenda Sanctorum cum notis Ioannis Molani S. T. D. Lovanii, Typis Hieronymi Nempaei, anno 1674.5 As mentioned above, both Duffy and Porter agree in citing as the source of our 25th proposition, book 3 and chapter 64. Therefore, it is to volume one that we direct our attention. For the sake of better understanding the context, we shall begin with chapter 61 of book three. The title of Chapter 61 are the words of Sacred Scripture: "Non facies tibi sculptile, ñeque omnem similitudinem quae est in coelo desuper, et que in terra deorsum, nec eorum quae sunt in aquis sub terra. Non adorabis ea ñeque coles/'6 In explaining these words of Holy Scripture, Hessels asserts that God prohibits the making of "sculptile et similitu- dines," not because the art of sculpture or painting is displeasing to Him, but the Almighty forbids images to be employed for divine cult, as if the image itself would be God, or, that which is represented would be able to express the true divinity. Of Chapter 62 is the heading: "De his qui imagines Deos esse sunt arbitrati." The author relates how stupid it is to think that an image of gold or silver, wood or stone, and made by the hands of man, can be considered as gods. Yet, this was the opinion of the Gentiles. Chapter 63 treats: "De his qui creaturas imaginibus representatas coluerunt." Examples of those who fall in this class would be the wor- shipers of the sea, the sun, serpents, birds, beasts and the like. Finally, there is Chapter 64, the indicated source of our 25th proposition. For the title is: "De his qui Deum verum figurare conati sunt." For reasons which will be obvious later, we reproduce the text exactly as found in the book. 5 In the beginning of the volume is a letter of Henry Van Grave to John Soteaux, in which Hessels is thus praised: "Erat enim (ut non ignoras) vir ille incomparabilis, et praeter eximiam qu andam pietatem, praeclaris animi dotibus excellenter a Deo exornatus. Ingenio imprimis summo atque amplis- simo, ac prope divino : quippe ad comprehendum celerrimus, ad excogitandum acutissimus, ad indagandum sagacissimus, denique ad omnes perrumpendas difficultates acerrimus." A brief biograohv of Hessels is also eri ven. 6 Cfr. Exod. 20, 4; Deut. 5, 8. 6 Franciscan Studies 1960</page><page sequence="64">82 S.

Supra omnem enim circumscriptionem est divina natura, sed humana circumscribi et definiri potest. Upon examining this page, one recognized the text of the 25th prop- osition, with a few minor changes. To be carefully observed is the second marginal note on the right hand side of the page, namely, Aug. cap. 7 lib . de fide et symbolo. Upon investigating the seventh chapter of the Liber de fide et symbolo of St. Augustine, we find something most inter- esting. The ten lines of the text of Hessels, that is, from, "non igitur quasi humana forma circumscriptum esse . . all the way to, . . si a terrena cupiditate at que errore mundetur," are verbatim the words of St. Augustine. Included within these lines is also our 25th proposition. We may ask, why did the anti-jansenists select the words of St. Augus- tine and propose this as a proposition to be condemned? In all prob- ability they made a serious blunder. On examining the text of Hessels we can understand how this error happened. When quoting from Sacred Scripture, the author places the citations in italics. Even the Scripture text from St. Paul's epistle to the Romans, 2, v. 23, which is contained within his quotation from St. Augustine, is placed in italics. The anti- jansenist who extracted what is now the 25th proposition most probably considered these as the words of Hessels himself. To comprehend the own opinion of Hessels in this matter, it is necessary to proceed to the following chapter of his Catechism. Chapter 95 is entitled: "De imaginibus Dei Patris, sive S. Trinitatis/' As the author points out, although we read in Sacred Scripture phrases which represent God the Father as sitting, this is not to express his persona , but rather an operatio , that is, his judging. Likewise, when referring to the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove or of fiery tongues, this method of speaking does not intend to represent his person, but rather to desig- nate a certain effect. Hessels then continues: Licet autem periculum non sit, ne rudes opinentur Spiritum Sanctum esse columbam, vel linguas igneas; sicut nec Iudaeis periculum erat, ne putarent vocem quam audiverant in monte Sinai, aut ignem et fumum quem videbant, esse Deum, cum ex imaginibus, tamen, quibus Deus Pater, aut Spiritus Sanctus effigiatur in humana specie, facile in errorem Anthropo- morphitarum, qui pu tant Deum secundum divinitatem habere corpus et humanam effigiem, esseque circumscriptum, incidant imperiti, propter quos praecipue imagines ponuntur (rudibus enim imagines non videntur tam facile 6*</page><page sequence="66">84 S. PERA esse metaphoricae, quam spiritualibus viris visiones) non facile admittendae sunt huiusmodi imagines: sicut capitulo praecedenti ex Patribus fecimus manifestum. Several lines later occurs another passage for our consideration: Verum quidem est, imaginem Dei Patris in tali effigie, quali Ioanni et Danieli visus est, non fore reiciendam si nonnisi ab eruditis et spiritualibus viris posset conspici : sed quia imago fixa manet et omnibus conspicua semper est, nec semper rudibus praesto est doctor, omittenda est eiusmodi imago. Therefore, in this matter we are able to summarize the opinion of Hessels thus : because of the danger of anthropomorphism for the un- learned, an image of God the Father in human form should not be easily admitted, should be omitted. The two phrases of Hessels, non facile ad- mittendae and omittenda est , are not as strong as the expression nefas est of the 25th proposition. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT Regarding this proposition Porter7 briefly states that the Spanish inquisition ordered it to be removed from the Catechism of Hessels. The anti-jansenists8 in their criticism refer to the proposition as con- taining the opinion of Calvin, who condemned all sacred images. More- over, they assert this proposition renews the error of the Iconoclasts condemned in the second Council of Nicaea; it is also contrary to the universal practice of the Church. About the middle of the year 1683 the theological faculty of Louvain had prepared their answer to the attack launched against them.9 It was at this time that the faculty indicated that this proposition contained the words of St. Augustine. The faculty defended Hessels by saying he did not intend the prohibition of every image, but only the same kind as forbidden by St. Augustine. About the time the Doctors of Louvain were preparing their state- ment to be sent to Rome, the consultors in the Eternal City gave the following judgment.10 Sabbatini: non esse censurandam;11 Bianchi: esse temerariam et Ecclesiae iniuriosam; 7 AOS, 193, at proposition 74. 8 Cfr.

In the summary presented by Diaz is the following12: "Censura maioris partis theologorum fuit quod praesens propositio sit temeraria et scandalosa, et alii addiderunt earn f avere erroribus novatorum." Viva13 who wrote toward the end of the 17th century makes no mention of the Liber de fide et symbolo , although he does refer to St. Augus- tine's de Civitate Dei , book 4, chapter 21. Writing shortly after the decree of condemnation, Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher14 makes no explicit statement that the 25th proposition contains the words of St. Augustine. He merely states that Hessels in explaining the First Commandment, cites various texts of Sacred Scripture, which prohibit representing God by an image. He then presents part of the text of the Catechism (in- cluding the words of St. Augustine), but in no way indicating that Hessels is quoting from the famous Doctor of the Church. However, after various explanations, he does state: Adeoque pro se frustranee allegat S. Augustini de fide et symbolo , cap. 7. nam sanctus Pater aperte de simulacro loquitur, quo suo tempore perfectam Dei similitudinem, formamque exprimi aliqui putabant, et in idolatriam declinabant, quod periculum ut evitaret S. Pater, nefas dicebat tale simula- crum in templo Christianorum collocare. Steyaert15 in the first edition of the Novitas utrimque makes no reference to the fact that Hessels was quoting from St. Augustine. Since this omission was called to his attention by theologis eximiis ,16 he found it necessary to place an addition to his treatment of this subject. He justifies the Doctor of the Church, for one must consider the con- ditions and circumstances of the age. Yet, Steyaert disagrees with Hessels in holding that the same conditions prevail in the 16th century. It is also Steyaert who makes an interesting remark, namely, that in Belgium he has never seen such a doctrine held, taught or practiced; in fact, in that country are found many images of God the Father, the Holy Spirit and the Blessed Trinity. If this is the case we wonder about 12 AGOFM, III, il, fol. 702r. 18 VIVA. oi&gt;. cit.. v. Q3. 14 HILARIUS A S. SEPULCHRO, op. cit., p. 46-48.

Torrecilla,17 a Spanish Capuchin, devotes over 20 pages to the treat- ment of this proposition. Although he claims to have been moved by his spiritual Father, Antonius de Fuente la Peña,18 without doubt he was also influenced by the fact that Spain at this time had been trying to obtain from the Holy See a feast in honor of God the Father.19 His fiery zeal led him to conclude that this proposition is heretical and as such was condemned by Alexander VIII. In referring to St. Augustine, Torrecilla does not make mention of de fide et symbolo , but rather epistola 4ç and super Psalmum 113 , in which places, according to this Capuchin, the Doctor of Grace is referring to the prohibition of idols. Le Bachelet20 indicates that the 25th proposition is found in the Catechism of John Hessels, and is based on St. Augustine. However, he claims, in this regard no longer is there danger of anthropomorphism. CONCLUSION We have already seen in our treatment of the 22nd proposition how the anti-jansenists in all probability unknowingly extracted a proposition from the words of St. Cyprian. Likewise, they formulated the 23rd proposition from the words of St. Dionysius. Now, concerning the 25th proposition they have blundered once more. Because of the unfortunate practice in the 16th century of not always indicating direct speech by some sign, an anti-jansenist, thinking he was extracting the proposition from the words of John Hessels, a friend of Baius, in reality formed it from the words of St. Augustine. If Hessels respected the opinion of this renowned Father of the Church, still he did not hesitate to tone down the forcefulness of his words. 17 M.

SOURCE OF THE PROPOSITION The second of the two propositions, which concerns the Mother of God in the list of 31, 1 is attributed to a small publication of less than twenty pages, namely. Mónita salutarla Beatae Mariae Virginis ad cultores suos indiscretos. Printed by Francis d'Ercle it appeared anony- mously the first time in November 1673 at Ghent with an approbation by Ignatius Gillemans.2 In this opuscule consisting of eighteen small sections (each called monitio), most of which are less than a page, the author has placed in the mouth of the Blessed Mother a series of ad- monitions that she addresses to her devotees. This work, at once taken as a Jansenistic production, excited great controversy, one may say, in all Europe.3 In the year 1674 and 1675 there appeared more than forty writings either for or against the Mónita Salutaria .4 It was soon translated into French under the title Avis salu- taires de la B. V. Marie à ses dévots indiscrets , as also with the title Aver- tissemens salutaires . . .6 A translation was likewise made in Flemish. This work did not escape various condemnations.6 The Jesuitical University of Mainz, known for its anti-jansenistic program, in 1674 1 As we have already mentioned, the other proposition regarding the Mother of God is the 24th. In the article of L. CEYSSENS, La vingt-qua- trième des trente-et-une propositions jansénistes condamnées en ióço , in Anto- nianum, 32 (1957) 47 - 7°&gt; the author has proven that the 24th proposition historically speaking is not jansenistic, but a fabrication of the anti-janse- nists. 2 We have already spoken of this man under the treatment of the 16th proposition. 8 Cfr.

PERA condemned the Mónita as: "scandalosa, noxia, officina Jansenarionim olentia et gustui Luthero-Calvinicorum vehementer arridentia." The Spanish Inquisition issued its condemnation in the same year. When the Holy Office condemned the Latin edition in June, 1674, it affixed an unusual phrase, namely, " Suspenditur . Donee etc." The other books mentioned in the decree were condemned without restriction. The ad- versaries of the Mónita interpreted this etc. by donee corrigatur, while its defenders by donee eedatur tumultus. Heated discussions continued. By a new decree of June 22, 1676 it was again condemned donee corriga- tur.1 The Flemish translation was condemned by a decree of June 22, 1676 and the French on January 25, 1678. Even though this polemic work has been considered jansenistic,8 recent study has shown the author himself, Adam Widenfeld, a doctor of law of Cologne, was not a jansenist, but a militant Catholic who wrote against Protestantism and who was very devoted to the Blessed Mother. It was his claim that certain indiscreet Catholics in their devotion to Mary were hindering the conversion of the Protestants.9 We find our 26th proposition in all the lists of Porter and Duffy.10 Nevertheless, upon first reading its indicated source according to Porter in his list of 105, a difficulty presents itself. We read there, epistola apo- logetica , pag. 45. 11 This same source is also given in the list of 31 as found in the Vatican archives.12 After investigating however, the Theologia Baio-ianseniana of Duffy, as well as the lists of Porter, and making comparisons between the propositions of these lists, it is obvious we have here a case of a copyist error. There is no doubt that the source of our 26th proposition according to Porter should read, Mónita salutaria , monitio 6. 7 Cfr. P. HOFFER, op. cit., p. 178 - 180. 8 Estrix in his Specimen treats of the Mónita in part III, chapter VII ; again in part VI, chapter VI, par. 2. One of his criticisms is the fact that throughout the entire Mónita salutarla, never is there found the explicit term Mother of God , although, he says, there were occasions to use this ex- pression. 9 Cfr. HOFFER, op. cit., p. 183 - 207. 10 This proposition is had with Duffy: in his Theologia Baio-ianseniana , part III, n. 179; among the 356 propositions, n. 317; among the 96 propo- sitions, n. 90; with Porter: among the 238 propositions, n. 226; among the 105 propositions, n. 90. 11 It refers to the following: èl pistola apologetica quam autnor libelli cui titulus " Mónita salutaria B.

VIII 89 EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT We shall now present the text of the Mónita salutarla relative to our proposition. We shall give the entire sixth section, or monitio , as it is called: Non est pulchra dilectio, vel laus quae Deo non tribuit omnia. Illi soli debetur laus, honor et gloria (1 Tim. 1, 17). Ego non quaero gloriam meam (loan. 8, 50), sed gloriam eius qui creavit et redemit me. Laus quae mihi defertur, is non redundet primo et principaliter in Deum qui dedit mihi omnia quae habeo, non est laus mea, sed vituperium (St. Aug., De vera relig. c. 55). 18 Laus quae mihi defertur ut mihi vana est, quae vero mihi defertur ut Matri et Ancillae Domini sancta est. Ego enim ante pedes Agni mitto cor onam meam (Apoc. 4, 10), quam vis sit pretiosissima inter omnes alias, sciens quod a me nihil sum. Ego enim conserva vestra sum (ibid. 22, 9). Cum itaque me laudes, praecipue Deum mecum lauda et magnifica quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae et fecit mihi magna qui potens est. (Lu. 1, 48 - 49) Si me invocas, ad hoc invoca, ut defectum et imbecillitatem tuam sup- pleam precibus meis ad Deum. The place from which the proposition has been extracted is evident. To be noted is its position in a sentence, the two parts of which are in opposition. Textually, the 26th proposition, with the exchange of mihi for Mariae is found in the Mónita salutaria, monitio 6 , as indicated by the anti-jansenists. We will discuss its meaning later. DOCTRINAL JUDGMENT Porter14 remarks that the proposition is contrary to the cultus duliae of the saints. The anti-jansenists in their criticism relate the following15: Est Lutheri et Calvini sententia damnata in Tridentino, sessione 25 titulo de invocatione et veneratione Sanctorum;16 et sane Angelus Gabriel Lucae 10 laudavit Mariam ut Mariam, id est, antequam fieret Mater Dei, 18 In his work De vera religione, chapter 55, St. Augustine has in effect expressions which support the opinion of Widenfeld, for example: "J usti autem homines, et in uno Deo habentes omnia gaudia sua, quando per eorum facta Deus benedicitur, congratulantur laudantibus ; cum vero ipsi tamquam ipsi laudantur, corrigunt errantes quos possunt; quos vero non possunt, non eis gratulantur, et ab ilio vitio corrigi volunt . . MIGNE, Patrologia latina, vol. 34, col. 171, n. hi. Since the references of Widenfeld are marginal, thus lacking a more accurate correspondence to the text, it is possible that the citation of St. Augustine refers equally or even more to the passage from which the condemned proposition has been extracted. 14 AOS, 193 at propositionem 88. 15 Cfr.

PERA dicens: "Ave gratia plena, Dominus tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus;" haec sane est eximia laus et iam Mariae ut Mariae, et alia delenda erunt omnia praeclara encomia, quibus Sancti Patres Augustinus, Ambrosius, Anseimus, Bernardus et alii Mariam eff erunt. The theological faculty of Louvain17 in defending itself against the attacks of the anti-jansenists says that it never held any such doctrine, and that the proposition, as it stands, is at least male sonans , even though the phrase ut Mariae is explained as excluding Mary as the Mother of God, and disregarding her sanctity. The majority of the examiners of the Holy Office were quite severe in their judgment, as we see from the following18: Sabbatini : esse scandalosam et piarum aurium offensivam vel ad minus male sonantem; Bianchi: dixit in sensu Lutheri esse scandalosam, Sanctorum Patrum et Ecclesiae iniuriosam ac piarum aurium offensivam ; in sensu vero personali prout distinguitur a dignitate maternitatis esse erroneam in fide, in sensu Constantini Copronymi esse pariter errorem in fide; Dominicus a S. Trinitate: esse scandalosam, B. Virgini Mariae iniurio- sam et forsan haereticam seu sapientem haeresim; Maderno fuit absens ob malam valetudinem; Esparza: esse captiosam, seductivam fidelium, temerariam et scandalo- sam; Fabri, esse piarum aurium offensivam et sapientem haeresim; Mazza: dixit quod si intelligatur de laudibus approbatis ab Ecclesia, est impia, sacrilega et iniuriosa Ecclesiae, si intelligatur quod Maria ut mulier non sit laudanda est temeraria et sapiens haeresim; Pozzobonelli : dixit esse temerariam, scandalosam, piarum offensivam, erroneam, haeresim sapientem vel ei proximam. The authors writing after the decree of condemnation see in this 26th proposition a denial not only to Mary, but to all the saints of the cultus absolutus.19 According to Viva,20 this proposition in distinguishing between the praises given to Mary as the Mother of God, and that given 17 Cfr.

VIII 91 to her as such (i. e. abstracting from this prerogative) is contrary to the doctrine of the Church regarding the cult of saints. For to all the saints, and a fortiori to Mary, by reason of their own proper holiness and excellence is due praise, honor and veneration. Steyaert21 remarks: "haud dubie male sonat et simpliciter falsa est," and explains that praise and honor is not given to Mary only relative as to images. She is to receive honor absolutus because of her intrinsic and admirable qualities. Hilary of the Holy Sepulcher22 gives the same when he says that the Blessed Mother is honored ratione sui , and not only in as far as she is related to Christ. According to Le Bachelet23 this proposition distinguishes the cult given to Mary in as far as she is the Mother of God or handmaid of the Lord, and in as far as it is given to her as such. Widenfeld, according to Le Bachelet, approved the former but rejects the latter. This doctrine, therefore, of the proposition denies the cult due to the Blessed Mother by reason of her own proper holiness and excellence. In the opinion of this author the proposition is false in itself, scandalous, shocking to pious ears, and tends to diminish the cultus hyperduliae, which is owed to the Virgin Mary.24 CONCLUSION The 26th proposition, as it stands, is lacking in clarity, as is evident from the judgment of the examiners of the Holy Office presented above. Bianchi, for example, made three distinctions : in sensu Lutheri , in sensu vero personali , in sensu Constantini Copronymi. For Dominic of the Most Holy Trinity the proposition was scandalous, injurious to the Blessed 21 STEYAERT, op. cit.. p. 367 - 369. 22 HILARIUS A S. SEPULCHRO, op. cit., p. 48-49; HOFFER, op. cit., p. 293 in note 2 indicates that the argument of Hilarv is illogical. 23 LE BACHELET, op. cit., col. 760. 24 Gerberon, also writing after the decree of condemnation, interprets the proposition in a somewhat different manner. He writes: "Sensus huius propositionis obvius est, quod omnis laus quae defertur Sanctissimae Virgini, quae propter singulárem suam excellentiam specialiter nomine Mariae indigitatur, vana est. Quo sensu propositio esset impia et blasphéma. Et ideo Delator ut huic Auctori invidiam constaret, ac eius censuram a Sede Romana extorqueret, propositionem quam ipse ei tribuit sic confecit ex- presse nomine Mariae, quod in libelli enunciatione suppressum est. Sensus vero Auctoris omnino alienus est ab huiusmodi propositione intellecta iuxta sensum huiusmodi obvium, in quo ipsa esset impia ac blasphéma. Nam iste Auctor non solum non dicit quod laus quae Beatissimae Virgini defertur vana sit, sed expresse asserit in sua propositione quod laus quae Beatae Virgini defertur ut est Mater et Ancilla Domini, sancta sit, quod ab Delatore truncatum est." Cfr. [GERBERON], Quaestio iuris pontificii circa decretum ab inquisitione Romana adversus XXXI propositiones latum a P. Le Prestre, Tolosalibus 1693 , p. 20-21.</page><page sequence="74">Ç2 S. PERA Virgin and perhaps heretical or tasting of heresy. Mazza also found it necessary to distinguish. To the anti-jansenists there was no ambiguity. For them it attacked the cultus duliae sanctorum. If praise to Mary as Mary is vain, that is, abstracting from her prerogative as the Mother of God and considering her own proper excellence and sanctity, then the praise given to the saints because of their own excellence is likewise vain. In other words, according to the anti-jansenists the 26th proposition denies to Mary and the saints the cultus absolutus. That the 26th proposition considered in its context can be taken in an orthodox sense, has been expressed by Hoffer in the following words25 : Replaçons-la dans son contexte immédiat: "Laus quae mihi defertur ut mihi, vana est; quae mihi defertur ut Matri et ancillae Domini, sancta est." Entre les deux membres, l'opposition est manifeste. Le second exclut toute ambiguité; le culte rendu à ma personne en tant qu'elle est revêtue des prérogatives de ma maternité divine et de ma sainteté,26 fondements du culte d'hyperdulie, est saint. La signification du premier membre dépend du sens donné au second mihi, or, ce mihi a suggéré deux interprétations; ou il s'agit de la personne de Marie "abstraite" de ses privilèges, ou de cette personne revêtue de la dignité de Mère de Dieu et de la sainteté. Ce dernier sens est d'avance exclu par l'opposition marquée dans le second membre de ^proposition. Reste le premier sens ; dans ce cas, la proposition des Avis est parfaitement orthodoxe, car la personne "abstraite" de ses prérogatives serait privée par le fait de tout ce qui lui confère une supériorité capable de fonder le culte de dulie. Widenfeld en somme, prie les fidèles de ne pas faire de la Vierge un second Absolu à côté de Dieu et totalement indépendant de lui. Bref, la Vierge convie ses dévots à chanter avec elle le Magnificat. From the context of monitio 6 it seems evident that the author in this particular place simply wished to emphasize that all praise given to Mary ultimately redounds to the glory of God.27 Praise given to creatures does not ultimately terminate in them, but must always go back to the Creator. This view is substantiated by the reference of St. Augus- tine's De vera religione (cfr. the above text of Widenfeld). Perhaps 25 Cfr. HOFFER, op. cit., p. 292 - 294. 26 In a footnote the author gives the following: Il semble que le mot ancilla ait bien ce sens: c'est par là que Marie ressemble aux autres saints et mérite le culte de dulie; le culte d'hyperdulie est dû à sa dignité de Mère de Dieu." 27 A similar idea was expressed by Bossuet: L honneur que 1 on rend à la sainte Vierge (devait) être blâmé, s'il n'était pas religieux, c'est-à-dire, s'il ne se rapportait pas à Dieu, qui est l'object de la religion." Cfr. H. BRE- MOND, Histoire littéraire du sentiment religieux en France, vol. IX, Paris 1932, p. 254.</page><page sequence="75">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 93 Widenfeld had in mind the Italian alchemist, Joseph Borri, who was spreading his false opinions especially in Germany. Among his errors was the assertion that the Blessed Mother was divine and the possessor of divine attributes.28 Also to be noted is that some of the accusers as Porter and Viva, and some of the examiners, thought that only the maternity of Mary was considered by Widenfeld as the object of praise. Thus they dis- regarded the clear words of the author himself: "laus quae mihide fertur ut Matri et Ancillae." Thus the 26th proposition, violently (?) extracted from the work of a non-jansenist, and wrongly interpreted, has been condemned. GENERAL CONCLUSION We now wish to consider the various conclusions relative to the source of the propositions treated, the examination of the texts, and then the doctrinal judgments. Concerning the source of the ten propositions there are two, namely, the 18th and 23rd attributed to the well known jansenist, Anthony Arnauld. Proposition 25 is ascribed to the Catechism of John Hessels, who was an intimate friend of Michael Baius. The Augustinián, Christian Lupus, who although frequently accused of jansenism, always liberated himself, is claimed to be the author of the 14th proposition. In the list of 31, however, two others, that is, the 4th and 5th are likewise said to be from his pen. Four propositions have been extracted from works on moral theology. Thus propositions 17 and 22 are attributed to the Specimen moralis christianae et moralis diabolica in praxi of Giles Gabrielis of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis; and the Tyrocinium theologiae moralis of Macarius Havermans is asserted as the source for propositions 9 and 10. From anonymous yet identified works, namely, the Mónita salutar ia and Cánones poenitentiales , were extracted propositions 26 and 16 respectively. With regard to the examination of the texts of our ten propositions, the 9th and 10th are textually the same as found in the indicated source, which is the Tyrocinium of Havermans. However, placed in their con- text, we believe they easily admit of an orthodox interpretation. 28 Cfr. A. MAGNOCAVALLO, Notizie e documenti inediti intorno all ' alchimista Giuseppe Borri, in Archivio storico Lombar dico, serie 3 a, 18 (1902) 381 - 400; L. CEYSSENS, Le Petit Office de l'Immaculée Conception, in Virgo Immaculata, t. XVII, 93.</page><page sequence="76">94 PERA Proposition 14 in omitting the word servilis , and considered as it stands, does not clearly and precisely relate the opinion of its proposed author, Christian Lupus. Although an addition has been made to prop- osition 16, we believe it is substantially found in its indicated source, but it does not seem to admit the interpretations indicated by anti- jansenistic commentaries. In our consideration of proposition 18, that of Anthony Arnauld, we have seen how the anti-jansenists have added to the original text and changed its meaning. The individual who extracted proposition 22 in all probability did not realize he was composing the proposition from the words of St. Cyprian. Proposition 23 was formed from the De eccle- siastica hierarchia of Pseudo-Dionysius, which was quoted by Arnauld in his work on frequent communion. The 25th proposition unknowingly was fabricated by a careless anti- jansenist from the words of St. Augus- tine. A truncated sentence, which in its context can be correctly inter- preted, forms our 26th proposition. On the doctrinal judgments, in general, the brief commentaries of Porter as written in marginal notes next to each proposition, is sub- stantially the same as the longer and more developed remarks of the anti-jansenists as found in the manuscript entitled: Propositiones 105 Apostolicae Sedi exhibitae definitionibus Ecclesiae et Sanctorum Patrům sententiis demonstrantur contrariae. It is to be noticed that the anti-jan- senists try to prove that the propositions are contrary to the Council of Trent. This is the case with regard to all except the 16th, 18th and 25th. Furthermore, they have reduced five propositions, namely, 9, 10, 14, 25 and 26 to the errors of Luther, Calvin, Baius or Jansenius. The three propositions, 16th, 17th and 18th, which concern the order of parts in the sacrament of penance, as well as the two, 22nd and 23rd, on Holy Communion, are asserted by the anti-jansenists to be contrary to the legitimate practice of the Church. Moreover, four of these, 16, 17, 18 and 22 are claimed to repeat the error of Peter de Osma, namely, "non peracta poenitentia confitentes absolvi non debere," which was condemned by Sixtus IV in the 15th century. It must be kept in mind that the first four qualificators, Capizucchi, Pozzobonelli, di Laurea and Ricci were concerned with establishing the authenticity of the propositions, that is, to investigate if they were actually found in the indicated sources. As a result of this labor, Duffy's list of 105 was reduced to 32. The later examiners were more concerned with the doctrinal content. Of these latter it can be said that the eight official examiners appointed by Innocent XI, in general, were somewhat</page><page sequence="77">Rigoristic Propositions condemned by Alex. VIII 95 severe in their judgment. Sabbatini, the Italian Augustinián remains alone in his attempt to defend those condemned of jansenistic doctrine. No doubt Porter in a letter dated April 25, 1682 was referring to Sabba- tini when he wrote: "Examen nostrum aliquantulo lentius progreditur, ob infirmitatem Rmi. P. Alexandři Maderno, cuius absentia in ultimo congressu obfuit, ob detectum unum qui parti adversae ex ilia congre- gatane acriter favet et in causa fuit, ut cum aliqui theologi digestas et discussas quinqué propositiones damnare resoluerunt, nonnisi tres damnatae fuerint . . ." (Cfr. Romeinse brieven , p. 85). In only one instance do we discover the simple unmodified statement of another examiner besides Sabbatini: "non est censurabilis." This was the judgment of Julius Mary Bianchi, O.P. concerning the 10th proposition attributed to the Tyrocinium of Havermans. Regarding six of the propositions, namely, 9, 10, 14, 22, 23 and 26, the notion of heresy in some way or the other was expressed by some of the examiners. Of the later commentaries which we have considered, especially those of Viva and Hilary of the Sepulcher are more lengthy, elaborate and at times confusing. In general, they repeat the same criticisms of Porter and the other anti-jansenists, while adding yet other notations. Sylvano Pera, O.F.M.
