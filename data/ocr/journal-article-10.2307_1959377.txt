<plain_text><page sequence="1">Primates and Political Authority: A Biobehavioral Perspective* FRED H. WILLHOITE, JR. Coe College My central argument: There seem to be good reasons to believe that man's biological nature incorporates strong propensities to es- tablish and sustain dominance-deference hier- archies within his social groupings; that is, the stratification of political authority, power, and influence may be by nature intrinsic to human social existence. If this hypothesis is tenable, a presupposition common to both lib- eral and radical political thought must be critically reconsidered and perhaps drastically revised. The validity and utility of evolutionary- biological (or biobehavioral) analysis of polit- ical behavior are almost certainly not widely assumed, accepted, or even thought about very much, so far, by the great majority of political scientists. Nevertheless, this is a mode of anal- ysis of human behavior that, in a variety of forms, is increasingly utilized by zoologists (especially ethologists, who study animal be- havior), psychologists, anthropologists, and even a few sociologists.! Furthermore, there has * I am greatly indebted to Duane M. Rumbaugh, Georgia State University, for inspiring me to plunge into the primate literature, and to R. R. Larsen, Dalhousie University, and Roger D. Masters, Dart- mouth College, for reading an earlier draft of this paper.

Although in the hominid (pre- human and human species) line, generalized learning ability and intelligent adaptability have been strongly selected for, it is legitimate 2 E. g., Peter A.

That is, because we are the products of an evo- lutionary history, we are genetically "pro- grammed" to learn and persist in certain kinds of behaviors much more readily than is the case with other possible behaviors (and prob- ably also, to a limited degree, to respond in stereotyped ways to certain types of stimuli). This does not necessarily mean that a partic- ular behavior is inevitable, rather that heredity significantly affects the probability of its development.' Setting out from these premises, how might we discover what kinds of evolved behavioral propensities in man may be relevant to com- prehending and theorizing about political be- havior? This effort invariably requires spec- ulation about the nature of man's evolution, given the paucity, so far, of knowledge of the human behavioral genotype. Speculation can be, of course, more or less well grounded in and consistent with available evidence. The principal types of data used thus far in efforts to reconstruct the course of hominid evolution are studies of the behavior of other animal species (especially subhuman primates), inter- pretations of prehominid and hominid fossils, and observations of the behavior of contem- porary Stone Age peoples. There are major problems in the evolutionary interpretation of each of these categories of data, but new dis- coveries of considerable significance and sug- gestiveness are constantly being reported especially in the areas of primate behavior and hominid fossil-hunting. Reconstructions based on scientifically conscientious speculation seem at least deserving of serious consideration by all students of human behavior.

Carefully drawn analogies (and, to some degree, perhaps, homologies)8 between behavior patterns in monkeys and apes and human behaviors are both legitimate and enlightening. A leading primate behavior theorist and an anthropologist conclude: to understand human societies, one needs to discover the lineaments of them in subhuman primate societies. This now seems possible."' Monkeys and apes are considered to be of great significance for the study of man pri- marily because they are our nearest evolution- ary relatives. Among the major primate groups, divergences from common ancestors occurred, probably, from about ten to fifty million years ago. Most recently on this time scale predeces- sors of present-day great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans) and of hominids di- verged; next most recently, precursors of Old World monkeys (e.g., macaques, baboons) di- verged from the primate line that eventually led to man; and long before that time, the New World monkeys (e.g., spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys) had differentiated from the primate line which ultimately produced Old World monkeys, apes, and hominids. An em- inent primatologist points out that man shares a considerable degree of genetic potential with apes and monkeys and that anthropoid pri- mates have been very conservative species which have departed little from the ancestral pattern of primate structure. Thus, he con- cludes, it is quite reasonable to assume that studies of ape and monkey behavior can pro- 8 For a helpful attempt to specify the levels of com- parison between human behavior and that of other species, see Roger D. Masters, "Functional Ap- proaches to Analogical Comparison Between Species," Paper presented at Conference on the Logic of Infer- ence from Animal to Human Behavior, sponsored by the International Council on the Social Sciences, 1973. Masters distinguishes between a biological "analogy," which refers to common functions served by similar behaviors, and "homology," in which similarities be- tween species stem from a common evolutionary an- cestry. (Thus "those characteristics which are more or less common to all primates" might well constitute homologies. [Masters, personal communication.]) I Michael R. A. Chance and Clifford J.

Especially is this the case if the species studied lives in an environ- ment similar to that which early man probably inhabited (presumably because in different eco- logical settings differing phenotypical behav- iors will be manifested by separate populations of the same species -if the genotypical be- havioral range of a species is relatively broad).10 In regard to my central argument, then, what might we learn from primate behavior studies that may help us to comprehend a be- havioral pattern ubiquitously noted in human societies - the differential distribution of au- thority, power, and influence (political strat- ification)? Essentially, I agree that "political institutions, and particularly high ranking po- litical roles, seem functionally analogous to dominance hierarchies such as those found among many primates."' But further, this question must be considered: how likely does it seem that these functional similarities stem, 10 John Napier, The Roots of Mankind (Washing- ton: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1970), p. 219. An important animal behavior approach that supplements significantly the primatologists' efforts to understand human behavior is the study of predators. Since man evolved as a hunter-gatherer, "human social systems are the product of the selective forces operating on man the primate and man the carnivore . . . " (George B. Schaller and Gordon R. Lowther, "The Relevance of Carnivore Behavior to the Study of Early Hom- inids," Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 25 [Winter, 1969], 336). Study of hunting species may reveal types of selective forces and convergent pat- terns of adaptation intrinsic to this way of life - de- spite the enormous phylogenetic distance between predators and man. Evidence thus far is somewhat equivocal, but there appear to be intraspecies compe- tition and some forms - widely varying - of dom- inance-submission behavior in lions, hyenas, wild dogs, and wolves. The analogies between wolf pack struc- ture and behavior and human social groups are especially striking. On lions, see George B. Schaller, The Serengeti Lion: A Study of Predator-Prey Rela- tions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1972), esp. chap. 5; on hyenas, Hans Kruuk, The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1972), esp. chap. 6; on wild dogs, Hugo and Jane van Lawick- Goodall, Innocent Killers (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1971), pp. 49-101; on wolves, Jerome H.

Difficulties and complications immediately arise in attempting to discern the behavioral referents of "dominance" in various studies of primate behavior. (Other terms which are sometimes used, apparently as synonyms of "dominance," are "status hierarchy" and "rank order.") Frequently the direction and outcome of agonistic encounters (threats and attacks) are used as indicators of dominance; in other cases a primary measure is differential access to incentives (e.g., food, estrous females, fa- vored resting places); and sometimes a study focuses on leadership (or "forefronting") of group movement. These - and other proposed measures of rank order - are not invariably intercorrelated in every group of every primate species that has been studied.'2 Despite formi- dable methodological difficulties and, some- times, conceptual ambiguity, almost every study of primate social groupings among a wide variety of species has discerned definite rank differentiations among group members. Very frequently these relationships have been more clearly evidenced in deferential and sub- missive behaviors than in assertive and intru- sive activities. This point is emphasized by Hans Kummer, a leading student - both in field and in laboratory settings - of baboon behavior; Kummer asserts that it is the general rule among primate species that younger and weaker individuals defer to older and stronger ones and that males rank higher than females of the same age. Each group member learns its own rank of dominance. Fighting to deter- mine or clarify rank order is relatively infre- quent (but can be decisive when it does occur). The dominance order within a group seems to result primarily from some individuals learn- ing - through experience - automatic defer- ence to certain others, with respect to agonistic encounters or access to incentives.'3 Four Primate Species Credence may more readily attach to these generalizations if the nature and structure of 2 Irwin S.

I have singled out for this treatment studies of rhesus macaques, savanna-dwelling baboons, gorillas, and chimpanzees -primarily because one or more of these species has been commonly treated as the primate from which we might draw the most nearly valid analogies concern- ing the behavior of our prehominid and early hominid ancestors.'4 The rhesus macaque is a primarily terres- trial monkey native to India and some neigh- boring areas of southern Asia. The representa- tives of this species whose behavior has been most intensively studied, however, live on Cayo Santiago, a small island off the east coast of Puerto Rico; these are descendants of a breeding stock transplanted to this location by a primatologist in 1938.15 In his study, Kaufmann found in a troop of about 150 monkeys a clear-cut linear dom- inance hierarchy among the adult males, as determined by physical displacements of one animal by another and by the direction of aggressive and submissive signals. There ap- peared to be distinct rank orders both for dif- ferent groups of males and for individuals within those groupings. Most dominant were mature adult males in a "central hierarchy." Next in line were young adult males who tended to act together as a group to defend against attacks on one of them by other males; some of these young males were beginning to infiltrate the central hierarchy. Lowest in the male rank order were animals that were mainly orphans or sons of females in other bands; be- cause of their usual location in relation to the rest of the band, these are referred to as "pe- ripheral males." (In the study of macaques in India, a similar band structure was found. There was, however, less clear-cut ranking of every individual male, because two males who ranked lower than another individual would frequently team up to become dominant over 14For such assertions about baboons and macaques, see Napier, p. 219; about chimpanzees, see Alison Jolly, The Evolution of Primate Behavior (New York: Macmillan, 1972), p. 132. 15 For a study of this species in one of its native habitats, see Charles H. Southwick, Mirza Azhar Beg, and M. Rafiq Siddiqi, "Rhesus Monkeys in North India," in Primate Behavior, ed. DeVore, pp. 111-159. Most of the description and analysis of rhesus be- havior in the text is drawn from one of the Cayo Santiago studies: John H. Kaufmann, "Social Rela- tions of Adult Males in a Free-ranging Band of Rhesus Monkeys," in Social Communication Among Primates, ed. Stuart A. Altmann (Chicago: University of Chi- cago Press, 1967), pp. 73-98. him.'6 This kind of "coalition behavior" will be noted as significant also for savanna-dwell- ing baboons and chimpanzees.) What are the social functions of the dom- inance hierarchy in the rhesus band? The "alpha" (most dominant individual) male was usually followed by the females in the band who had young infants. Although he infre- quently initiated group movement, an initiative was seldom successful unless he participated in it. When the band was on the move, the males in the central hierarchy tended to remain in the center of its ranks, along with most of the females and infants. These dominant males also intervened to stop nearly every fight that was observed to break out between any other members of the band; this was done usually by running toward the combatants and threaten- ing them visually or vocally. Finally, a positive correlation was noted between males' ranks and the extent of their mating behavior; pre- sumably the higher ranking males were most successful in fathering offspring.'7 Savanna-dwelling baboons live in numerous areas of southern and eastern Africa, and their behavior has been studied fairly extensively in the field.'" These monkeys are close evolution- ary kin to the macaques, and are similar to them behaviorally in many ways. Thus a type of male dominance hierarchy found among some baboon troops appears to be a linear rank order with one adult male clearly and consistently in the alpha position.'9 But in other troops the dominance hierarchy involves a more complex form of the "teaming" or ''co- alition" behavior observed among macaques in India. (In these studies, dominance was de- termined by noting relatively stereotyped ag- gressive sequences among males and, to a lesser degree, by differential access to incen- tives such as estrous females and food provided by human observers.)20 Usually (though not invariably), if there are three or more adult males in the troop, the more complex kind of hierarchy develops. For example, in one troop there were six fully adult males. Three of these animals frequently " Southwick et al, pp. 144-151. "Kaufmann, passim. "This account is based on K.R.L.

None of the other three males in the band was ever seen to co-operate with any other individ- ual. Thus, although one of these latter was individually the most dominant male in the band, any two or all three of the "co-oper- ators" together were dominant over him. The latter trio were therefore considered to be the "central hierarchy" of the band. In another band, the significance of "coalition behavior" for dominance structure became clearly evident when one member of a two-male central hier- archy disappeared. Almost at once a formerly subordinate male displaced the remaining member of the central hierarchy and was soon joined in a new coalition of that type by a male that had only recently joined the band.21 Membership in the troop's central hierarchy seemed to facilitate a male's success in copu- lating with females at the peak of estrus (when they are most likely to conceive), even as com- pared to individually more dominant males outside the central hierarchy.22 The social functions of the dominance hier- archy appear to be quite similar to those dis- cerned in bands of macaques. Troop members ordinarily orient their attention to and follow the cues of the most dominant males. Thus, in troop movements, even though less dominant males usually go ahead of the troop, these ani- mals sometimes get temporarily separated from the body of the troop because the central hier- archy males have taken another direction. As with the macaques, the most dominant males ordinarily remain in the center of the troop on the move, along with females and their in- fants. As soon as any strange or predatory animal is sighted (usually signalled by a bark- ing sound from one of the peripheral males ahead, behind, or at the side of the troop), the central hierarchy males rush to confront in concert whatever danger may be present. Also like macaques, dominant male baboons - and almost exclusively the most dominant - fre- quently intervene to break up fights among other members of the troop, usually by means of noisy and menacing agonistic threats which seldom result in actual fighting. In sum, "the main characteristics of baboon social organiza- tion . . . are derived from a complex dom- inance pattern among adult males that usually ensures stability and comparative peacefulness within the group, maximum protection for mothers with infants, and the highest prob- 21 DeVore, p. 280. 22 Ibid., pp. 274, 281. ability that offspring will be fathered by the most dominant males."23 The primate species which are phylogenet- ically nearest to man are the African great apes -the gorilla and the chimpanzee.24 The gorilla is an endangered species now confined to certain lowland and mountainous rainforest areas of central Africa. Only the mountain gorilla has thus far been studied in the wild, but considerable attention has been given to its dominance-oriented behavior. Gorillas live in relatively permanent groups of from two to thirty individuals. They wander daily over large home ranges, feeding on rela- tively abundant types of plants. A typical group consists of one or more fully mature ("silver-backed") males, several females, half a dozen juveniles and infants, and one or more less mature ("black-backed") males. Also some "lone males" were observed (though no lone females); these animals seemed to associate freely with certain groups but never remained with any group for an extended period of time. Group organization is quite cohesive. It fea- tures a central core composed of a dominant silver-backed male and all of the females and young. All other males, both silver-backed and black-backed, tend to assume peripheral posi- tions as the group spreads out over a relatively small area (rarely exceeding two hundred square feet) to feed. Rank order largely corre- lates with body size; silver-backed males are dominant over all black-backed males, females, and young. If there are two or more silver- backed males in a group, they are arranged in a linear dominance hierarchy. Dominance is most often expressed with respect to positions along narrow trails or in favored sitting places. A subordinate animal ordinarily moves aside to be supplanted by a dominant individual; the latter's mere approach or brief stare at the subordinate is usually a sufficient stimulus to effect this change. Occa- sionally the dominant animal gives the lower- ranking one a light tap with the back of the hand, which always produces movement by the subordinate. `3Hall and DeVore, p. 71. 24 For a lucid explanation of the evidence for this evolutionary relationship, see S. L. Washburn and Ruth Moore, Ape Into Man: A Study of Human Evolution (Boston: Little, Brown, 1974), pp. 11-29. 25This description is based primarily on George B. Schaller, "The Behavior of the Mountain Gorilla," in Primate Behavior, ed. DeVore, pp. 324-367. For a much more elaborate account of the same study, see George B.

Every group member seems -to be constantly aware of the activity of the "alpha" male, and cues reflecting a change in the activity of the group are taken from him. Every part of the daily routine - travel, lo- cation of rest stops and feeding places, time and place of nesting - appears to be largely determined by the leader. In one case of a per- ceived external threat (the human observer), the leader dropped behind the fleeing group to face the intruder. When the group is moving rapidly, the leader is at or near the front of it; when its movements are slow, he is often lo- cated in the center or near the end of the group. Maintenance of order does not appear to be a significant function of the dominant male-leader - primarily because intragroup aggressiveness is confined to staring, snapping at, or bluff-charging another group member. Even these kinds of interactions were extremely rare.26 The final species included in this brief sur- vey is the chimpanzee, which lives in rain- forest and woodland areas of central Africa.: Until very recently, it was believed that chim- panzees do not live in closed, permanent groups, as do savanna baboons and macaques. Jane Goodall reported that, within a large home range, chimpanzees move about in small temporary groups which may consist of any combination of age and sex classes: "The only group that may be stable over a period of several years is a mother with her infant and young juvenile offspring."28 But in 1971, dramatic changes began to 4a Much more aggressiveness and activity than Schal- ler noted has been observed by Dian Fossey, who is currently engaged in a much longer-term study of mountain gorillas than was Schaller's. E.g., she ob- served some skirmishes between gorilla groups and, in three cases, saw lone males enter a group and engage in fights in which infants were killed (Jane Goodall, "Intra-specific Aggression," Lecture delivered to Human Biology Core Course, Stanford University, October 17, 1975). 27 Most of our information on chimpanzee behavior comes from studies done by or under the direction of Jane Goodall, whose observations in the field began in 1960 and are still continuing. To date (January, 1976) her most comprehensive scientific report is Jane van Lawick&amp;Goodall, "The Behaviour of Free-Living Chim- panzees in the Gombe Stream Reserve," Animal Be- haviour Monographs, 1, part 3 (1968), 165-311. See also Jane Goodall, "Chimpanzees of the Gombe Stream Reserve," in Primate Behavior, ed.

In their study, the Reynoldses concurred (pp. 393-396). occur in the life of the Gombe Reserve (Tan- zania) chimpanzee population which Goodall and her colleagues have been observing for a decade and a half. The whole large group sud- denly divided into two separate groups, which occupied distinct territories and became overt- ly aggressive toward each other. Young males now "patrol" the boundaries between their group's territory and their "enemy's." These terms may seem overly anthropomorphic, but when such "patrols" sight a lone chimp not be longing to their group, they are likely to chase that individual and attack viciously if the out- sider is caught. Several all-out bloody fights between members of these two groups have been witnessed, and at least three infants and three adults have been fatally wounded since early 1974.29 The early field reports on chimpanzee be- havior30 also reported such a paucity of dom- inance-submission interactions that Goodall questioned the feasibility of applying the dom- inance concept to a local chimpanzee popula- tion as a whole. Further study has persuaded her, however, that hierarchy and dominance are central features of chimpanzee group life. Although the hierarchy is not a.neat and rigid progression of linear dominance, both high- and low-ranking individuals usually have clear- cut statuses. An individual's rank may vary, depending upon the social-behavioral context (e.g., the presence or absence of other family members), an individual's current motivation level, or the animal's "mood.' However, Goodall determined that, in gen- eral, "the social status of each individual was ... fairly well defined."32 In dyadic encounters -usually competition for bananas provided by the observers - which animals would pre- vail became highly predictable. Furthermore, some animals frequently vacated favored rest- ing places when approached by certain others. In such interactions, all females were normally subordinate to all mature males. The male dominance structure is somewhat similar to that of savanna baboons, although dominance-deference interactions appear to be less frequent among chimpanzees than among baboons. The basic common feature is the 2' Goodall, "Intra-specific Aggression"; see also Michael T.

As with baboons, two chimpanzees may combine to express dom- inance over a single animal to which both "coalition" partners are individually subordi- nate. But at any time within a group, one male clearly occupies the "alpha" position; he most frequently threatens and sometimes attacks the other males but is almost never attacked and seldom threatened by any of them. Infrequent- ly, certain young but mature males; try to dis- place the current alpha male. Within the Gombe population, three successful attempts have been observed, and in two cases the chal- lenger was supported closely in agonistic en- counters by another mature male (known in one case to be the challenger's brother). Some males seem much more highly motivated to engage in dominance competition than do oth- ers, and intelligence seems- to be more im- portant than size and strength as a determinant of success in rising to the alpha position." Discerning the adaptive functions of dom- inance-deference behavior in chimpanzees is very difficult, and the leading observers of their behavior in the wild have largely re- frained from speculating on this point. The recent events at Gombe suggest the possibility that the hierarchical order may serve, in most circumstances, to restrain overt expressions of the dangerous - even deadly - aggressiveness which these animals have now surprisingly manifested. But why they are that aggressive is another unsolved evolutionary puzzle; the aggressiveness might be, in part, a phylogenetic holdover from an earlier, savanna-dwelling phase of chimpanzee evolution.34 But perhaps, ironically, comparisons with human behavior might prove to be the most promising route for arriving at some understanding of intra- specifically lethal, group-territorial aggressive behavior in chimpanzees. Primate-based Stratification Concepts A sociologist has recently argued that bio- logically based proclivities may well be a cause 3 Van Lawick-Goodall, p. 212; Goodall, "Social Hierarchy and Dominance." 3 According to Robin Fox, recent Japanese work indicates that the chimpanzee once had a wider distri- bution and lived in open territory. When faced with open country, chimpanzee groups became tightly or- ganized in apparent expectation of predatory attacks; for example, such groups exclude young, subadult males. (Robin Fox, "Alliance and Constraint: Sexual Selection in the Evolution of Human Kinship Systems, in Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man 1871- 1971, ed. Bernard Campbell [Chicago: Aldine, 1972], p. 295.) of dominance-deference behavior in various primate species, including man.35 Mazur points out that status differentiation within established face-to-face groups exists in all known human cultures. Extracting from the sociological liter- ature seven characteristics typical of such sta- tus orders, he seeks to compare the behavior of seven primate species ranging from the most primitive in evolutionary terms, the tree shrew, to man's nearest relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas - with respect to these traits of human groups. On the basis of admittedly incomplete evidence, Mazur concludes that most of these status-relevant behaviors are manifested in sub- human primate species and that a trend seems to exist for more of these traits to appear in species which are closer to than those which are more distant from man on the evolutionary time-scale. He concludes that status differenti- ation as such (i.e., the underlying pattern of motivation for the great variety of particular forms this phenomenon assumes among differ- ent groups in diverse cultures) very probably has a "noncultural" (phylogenetic) basis. In- deed, he tentatively advances an even broader suggestion: "Perhaps sociologists whose inter- ests are limited to humans should accept cross- species behaviors as 'given' and requiring no further explanation, as most of us accept hun- ger and the sex drive as given."" The relevance of primate behavior studies to the understanding of political stratification in human societies may be clarified somewhat through consideration of two theoretical con- ceptions that have been advanced by prima- tologists. One of these is an essentially func- tional concept: Bernstein notes that in numer- ous species of Old and New World monkeys 33 Allan Mazur, "A Cross-Species Comparison ot Status in Small Established Groups," American Socio- logical Review,. 38 (October, 1973), 513-530. 3aibid., pp. 513-514, 517-525, 526. Mazur's argument strikes me as consistent with the primate data and as logically persuasive. I believe that he is unnecessarily restrictive, however, in asserting that "there is no bio- logical justification" for concluding that "large-scale social stratification must also be a noncultural charac- teristic" (p. 527). While it is certainly correct that macro-stratification has not been observed in non- human primates, that is fundamentally because of man's most important species distinction - an enor- mously developed symbolizing capacity, manifested primarily through language. In a book which Mazur cites because of his apparent disagreement with its authors on this point, Tiger and Fox argue cogently that the macrostructures of human societies exist only because of man's symbolic-cultural capacities but that symbolism mainly and fundamentally expresses varia- tions on a finite number of behavioral themes which may be discerned by means of thorough and careful cross-species comparisons.

This social role has been noted in nearly all species which manifest strong intragroup dominance relationships and also in some species in which rank order is either difficult to discern or very poorly developed.3" Recently Bernstein has suggested that an es- tablished rank order within a primate group contributes to the regularity and predictability of individuals' responses and thus to the or- dered distribution of roles -essentially to the maintenance of order -within the group. He ,even concludes that intragroup aggression seems "to be motivated primarily by efforts to preserve established social position and to en- force expected patterns of social behavior, rather than resulting from active competition leading to conflict."38 In sum, social order it- self -at least among a number of primate species -may be mainly a consequence of individuals' motivations to establish and main- tain places for themselves in a dominance- deference rank order. A somewhat more highly developed con- ception -a kind of "proto-theory" - has been formulated by Michael Chance and elaborated by him in collaboration with Clifford Jolly.39 Chance is leery of functional generalizations, given the fragmentary state of current data on primate behavior. He considers a structural conception to be much more tenable and thus advances the idea of "attention structure" as the behavioral common denominator in most, if not all, rank-oriented primate groups. In- stead of differential access to incentives, A more rewarding way of defining the dominance status of a supremely dominant individual is that he or she is the focus of attention of those holding subordinate status within the same group.... A redefinition of dominance is now proposed on the assumption that the attention-binding effect of an animal in a group is essentially the quality which puts it in a behaviourally focal position, and which also tends to place it near the group's spa- tial centre. The dominant animal therefore may be said to dominate the attention of others at most, if "Bernstein, "Primate Status Hierarchies," p. 74. 31 Irwin S. Bernstein and Thomas P. Gordon, "The Function of Aggression in Primate Societies," Amer- ican Scientist, 62 (May-June, 1974), 308. '39 The initial formulation occurs in M. R. A. Chance, "Attention Structure as the Basis of Primate Rank Orders," Man, 2 (December, 1967), 503-518; see also Chance and Jolly, Social Groups of Monkeys, Apes, and Men, pp. 173-175. not all, times, and usually without specific actions to do so.40 In this perspective, the focus is on the be- havior of subordinates as much as if not more than on that of dominant animals, and the dif- ferential distribution of group members' at- tention does appear to hold consistently across group structures in many more primate species than is the case with aggressive dominance or linear rank order. Among- savanna baboons and macaques the central hierarchy males are very much the predominant focus of attention, both of females, who remain relatively near them, and of peripheral males, who most often remain a certain distance away from the spatial center of the troop. Members of a gorilla group seem to take nearly all their behavioral cues from the dominant silver-backed male, while other mature males remain in locations periph- eral to the core of the group. Processes of group movement and of inter-male agonistic competition in chimpanzees indicate that some of these animals tend to exert an attention- binding effect on the others.4" The "attention structure" concept also seems to account for rank order behavior among species not specif- ically discussed above, such as Japanese and bonnet macaques and hamadryas baboons.42 Of critical importance for Chance's proto- theory is the "concept of attention structure as a cause as well as an effect" of dominance.43 For it is on this hypothesis that Chance and Jolly base their interpretation of charismatic leadership (in Weber's sense) in human soci- eties. Rather than being attended to because of his position in the official dominance hier- 40 Chance, p. 509. Emphasis in the original. A particularly dramatic instance of rank-order change - one male's displacing another in the alpha position - can be readily interpreted as demonstrat- ing the importance of attention structure among chim- panzees. This transformation was caused by an adult male's discovering some empty kerosene cans, seizing them, and using them to make an unusually horren- dous noise during a ritualistic "charging run," one of the principal forms of dominance competition among adult males of this species. The attention that he thereby drew to himself persisted, and - after several nonviolent agonistic contests - he was deferred to by all other group members, including the previous alpha male.

In times of severe social crisis, confused and frightened people are more likely to attend to individuals who promise them personal or political salva- tion solely on the authority of that individual's distinctix e personhood or the doctrine which he seems to embody. Because such individuals tend to receive attention far out of proportion to their objective ability to remedy the per- ceived crisis, "in attempting to explain charis- matic movements we should look for the oper- ation of an ethologically based attention-bind- ing mechanism." Further evidence for such a "mechanism" is that not infrequently political leaders 'capture the primitive allegiance of groups of men without necessarily having dis- played a policy at that stage."44 Several anthropologists have attempted thus far to apply Chance's "attention structure" concept to the analysis of human political and social status hierarchies.45 I shall single out for brief discussion Lar- sen's formulations, since he seeks to integrate Bernstein's "control role" into the "attention structure' framework. Specifically, Larsen speculates that the control role - "defending group or troop members against internal and external sources of disturbance" - is the pri- mary function, of the centripetal hierarchical attention structure.4 From this perspective, Larsen seeks to re- interpret Weber's typology of traditional, legal, and charismatic authority. It seems more parsi- monious to propose that there may be only one basic type of authority - a centripetal at- tention structure - and that Weber's "types" represent various stages or manifestations of this pattern. "Charismatic leadership" would thus "be viewed as a raw expression of atten- tion structuring and the process of recreating centripetal hierarchy." This "primitive adaptive process" meets the urgent needs of followers in crisis circumstances, for it "facilitates group cohesion, integration, and stress reduction." Traditional and legal authority can be seen, then, as resulting from the routinization and institutionalization of centripetal attention 44Chance and Jolly, pp. 208-209. 46 See, e.g., Lionel Tiger, "Dominance in Human Societies," Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 1 (1970). 298-301; Tiger and Fox, The Imperial Animal, pn. 39-51; R.

Evolution and Dominance The argument that propensities to learn and persist in some form of dominance-deference behavior may well inhere in the human geno- type requires some support from the highly controversial sphere of speculations about man's evolutionary history. The hominid fossil record is extremely fragmentary, certainly does not speak for itself, and obviously includes no fossilized behavior (though much can be dis- cerned about diet from teeth, posture and gait from leg bones, manual dexterity from hand bones, and culture from artifacts associated with bones). Nevertheless, holding that we have inherited behavioral proclivities requires some kind of attempt to reconstruct how and why certain behaviors may have evolved -that is, what their adaptive value could have been for our evolutionary ancestors. Because this topic is very broad and com- plex, and to do it justice would require ex- tended separate treatment, I shall focus on only one speculative reconstruction -Robert Bigelow's "The Evolution of Cooperation, Ag- gression, and Self-Control."49 This account very ably integrates paleontological, anatom- ical, genetic, ecological, psychological, histori- cal, anthropological, and ethological data (in- cluding a significant emphasis on primate be- havior) into an explanatory theory of human evolution in which dominance-deference be- havior plays an essential part. (The reader should keep very much in mind, however, that Bigelow's version of man's evolution is pre- sented here only as an example of such a re- construction; it is in no sense "proved" or "definitive" and on numerous points is open to honest disagreement and criticism.) Bigelow's central concern is to explain the evolutionary growth in size of the human brain. The fossil record seems to indicate that the brain in the hominid line has at least doubled and perhaps tripled in average size during the past three million years, and that this trend was appar- ently an accelerating process, with the bulk of the increase occurring during the past million years or less. Within the perspective of evolu- tionary time, this is an extremely brief period for a structure as incredibly complex as the 47 Ibid., pp. 7-8. 4Y For some other representative viewpoints, see fn. 9. 49 See fn. 1.</page><page sequence="10">1976 Primates and Political Authority: A Biobehavioral Perspective 1119 brain of Homo sapiens to develop. (An in- dividual's brain size per se does not necessarily signify a particular level of intelligence, but in comparisons between species, size correlates very highly with complexity of organization, hence with species-typical intelligence.) Thus some distinctive selective pressures must have been working upon the hominid line; Bigelow's controversial hypothesis is that the most in- fluential of these forces (in conjunction with generally accepted ones such as tool-making and tool-use) was intergroup competition among hominids -not limited to but def- initely including aggressive violence.50 According to Bigelow, it seems possible, even likely, that. this is how we evolved: Early hominids, as primates, lived in social groups; intragroup communication and co-ordination were necessary to protect these ground-dwell- ers against predators such as lions. and leop- ards.51 Hominids would have needed a capacity to respond aggressively against attacks, coupled with an ability to control potentially disruptive aggression during intragroup encounters. Groups competed occasionally with others for food and mates, though natural selection would have minimized such competition when hom- inids were seriously vulnerable to predators and thus needed to attend primarily to their defenses against other species. When such in- tergroup contests did occur, however, their outcome normally was determined by capac- ities for aggressive and intelligent group re- sponse (which necessitates intragroup cooperation).52 As brains and, consequently, social capac- ities, evolved, abilities to deal more effectively with predators increased so that hominid inter- group competition could, and presumably did, intensify (largely for the territories most capa- 50 Bigelow, pp. 1-3. That there was an important degree of prehistoric intergroup violence is perhaps Bigelow's most controversial -and controverted point. This is a fairly typical critique of it by an anthropologist: " . . . the evidence for intergroup violent competition is exceedingly weak when we look at modern hunter-gatherer groups, the pre-historic tool assemblages, and fossil remains. I do agree, however, that there probably was competition between groups and that it was most likely linked to relative efficiency of resource exploitation and rate of population growth rather than aggressive interaction." (R. R. Larsen, personal communication.) Goodall's recent observa- tions, discussed above, of group-territorial aggression in chimpanzees may provide some support for Bige- low's speculations. 51 Note the stress on the evolutionary importance of predation pressures on savanna baboons, in Irven De- Vore and K. R. L. Hall, "Baboon Ecology," in Pri- mate Behavior, ed. DeVore, p. 49. 52 Bigelow, pp. 3-4. ble of supporting a hunting-gathering way of life). On the average the most co-operative, in- telligently self-controlled groups would have succeeded in driving competing groups into less desirable peripheral areas. Successful hu- man groups were the selective force which pushed less intelligently co-operative groups into relatively inhospitable habitats, severely lessening their chances of contributing to the genetic future of the species. As intelligence increased, some individuals would have become capable of perceiving the advantages of co- operation with groups other than their own; this would have required not only intelligence but self-control in the form of inhibitions against attacking former enemies. A primary motive of intergroup co-operation, presum- ably, was to compete more effectively with still other human groups, and the selective premi- um on an optimal combination of intragroup (or intra-coalition) co-operation and intelligent self-control for the sake of effective intergroup competition would have increased. Success stemming from these traits, in a positive feed- back process, would have selected for in- creased size and complexity of the brain.53 At some unknown point in hominid evolu- tion, linguistic communication emerged (pre- sumably as a result of selective pressures for more effective communication, building upon a foundation made up of relatively high in- telligence in combination with a typical pri- mate capacity for vocalization of signals).54 This made possible even more highly co-ordi- nated intragroup activity and may well have intensified group integration. But language dif- ferences made communication even more diffi- cult with members of other groups and would have acted as an additional impetus to inter- group misunderstanding and hostility. Thus, "conceptual and emotional differences between 'us' and 'them' would have been accentuated."55 Within this scenario for man's evolution, self-control is critical: Capacities for self-control are provided by the actual physical structure of the brain, particularly the cerebral cortex. The result of human evolution was not an array of bodiless "instincts," but a net- work of physical nerves and endocrine organs. As this physical organization became more complex and efficient it provided greater capacities for learning from experience, for the repression of emotional drives, and hence for more intelligent 53 Ibid., pp. 4-5. 4 For relevant speculations, see Charles F.

Human capacities for learning, com- munications, government, science, and art are products of biological evolution, just as running, or any other manifestation of animal behavior, is an expression of the biological potential of inter- acting muscles, bones, and nerves.56 "Self-control" (or apparent inhibition of basic drives) is evidenced in many primates- for example, in thirsty baboons waiting till their group as a unit moves to a water source, in an adult male hamadryas baboon's refrain- ing from copulating with members of a neigh- bor's "harem," and in a central hierarchy savanna baboon's learning not to respond ag- gressively and competitively to the initiatives of his "coalition partners." In this context, the dominance hierarchy within a primate group can be seen as an evolved control system at a supra-individual level which tends to reinforce the self-control systems built into the nervous systems of individual group members.57 Man, Bigelow believes, is a typical primate in these respects. Without using the precise terms, he emphasizes the "control" function of dominance (and of the rules, laws, and cus- toms enforced by dominant authorities) and, implicitly, the significance of a "centripetal attention structure" for coordinating vital in- tragroup co-operative efforts during the course of hominid evolution. We have inherited this readiness to learn dominance-deference be- havior, and, Bigelow asserts, we still cannot do without effective dominance hierarchies. Like our ancestors, we combine capacities for vio- lence and for self-control, but the latter is not automatically sufficient to control the former. We have learned to extend our co-operative self-control from the small scope of prehistoric clans and tribes to that of groups comprising hundreds of millions, but "We are still learn- ing, and until we have learned to live in peace with one another on a global scale we will have to be restrained - by force, if necessary. Leaders and Followers From a perspective which seeks to encom- pass studies and theories of primate behavior and scientific speculations, such as Bigelow's, about the course and behavioral effects of man's evolution, it may prove useful to attempt to re- interpret in a summary way some social-psy- chological materials on leader-follower be- havior. Fiedler's attempts to describe the nature of leadership in face-to-face groups appear to 5Bigelow, p. 6. r7Ibid., pp. 27, 29, 31. -SIbid., p. 52. fit readily within the dominance-deference con- ception analyzed above: "The leader is one who succeeds in getting others to follow him" .9 (focal point of an "attention structure"). "Lead- ership, essentially, means power over other people . . . we shall here define the leader as the individual in the group who has the task of directing and coordinating task-relevant group activities" (the "control role"). Fiedler strongly emphasizes the interac- tional, contextual character of leadership: "there are no leaders where there are no fol- lowers. Above all, leadership is a relation- ship.""1 This accords well, I believe, with etho- logical-evolutionary perspectives. But before trying to clarify that point, it is necessary to discuss briefly the biological conception that (in its vulgar form) some individuals are "born leaders" (or possess "innate dominance").02 This idea should not be dismissed out of hand, even though it is obviously very much subject to abuse. Fiedler cites a study which found sig- nificant correlations between leadership and certain personality traits-e.g., intelligence, alertness, verbal facility, dependability, aggres- siveness, sociability, cooperation, adaptability."3 It is reasonable to assume that genetic capac- ities for developing these characteristics (given, of course, a supportive environment) vary wide- ly among individuals. More specifically, Bige- low speculates that individual differences in "social intelligence" the ability to predict the likely responses of others and to control one's emotional reactions under pressure - may rest, in part, upon a phylogenetic basis.04 In addition to abilities conducive to effective leadership, motivation to acquire high rank may also involve an innate component: . . .There are chiefs because there are, in any human group, men who, unlike most of their com- panions, enjoy prestige for its own sake, feel a strong appeal to responsibility, and to whom the burden of public affairs brings its own reward. These individual differences are certainly empha- sized and "played up" by the different cultures, and to unequal degrees. But their clear-cut exis- tence in a society as little competitive as the Nam- W. H.

They are rather part of those psychological raw materials out of which any given culture is made. Men are not all alike; and, in primitive societies . . . these individual dif- ferences are as keenly perceived and worked out as in our so-called "individualistic" civilization." However, no case has yet been made that there are any specific genes for generalized dominance or group leadership. It seems more likely that innate individual differences do exist in the capacity for developing certain person- ality traits which may enable an individual to become a leader in some circumstances but not in others. This hypothesis is compatible with the conclusion that "a person does not become a leader by virtue of his possession of any one particular pattern of personality traits, but the pattern of personal characteristics of the leader must bear relevant relationship to the present characteristics, activities, and goals of the group of which he is leader."" This returns our attention to the subordinate- follower aspect of dominance-leadership, spe- cifically to the "notion of submissiveness as a basic need in those who follow."67 Much to this point, I believe, are Stanley Milgram's famous (even notorious) social-psychological "obedience" experiments.'6 They involved plac- ing naive subjects in what they were told was a setting designed to test the effects of punish- ment on auditory memory. The subject would be seated at a genuine-looking (though phony) "shock generator" and instructed to give word tests to the experimenter's confederate, whom the subject believed to be a volunteer partic- ipant like himself. Each time the confederate made an error, the experimenter would order the subject to administer an electric shock to the "learner" by closing a switch. The switches were labeled at 15-volt intervals, from 15 through 450 volts. The experiment was actually Claude Levi-Strauss, "The Social and Psycholog- ical Aspects of Chieftainship in a Primitive Tribe: The Nambikuara of Northwestern Mato Grosso," in Com- parative Political Systems: Studies in the Politics of Pre-Industrial Societies, ed.

Ibid., p. 252. 68 First reported in Stanley Milgram, "Behavioral Study of Obedience," Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 67 (October, 1963), 371-378; reviewed, analyzed, and interpreted in Stanley Milgram, Obedi- ence to Authority (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974). intended, of course, to determine how many subjects would obey the "scientific authority's" commands to inflict punishment (supposedly) on a person who had done them no harm. The experiment was run in many versions, and the principal result was quite astounding. Although both students of psychology and psy- chiatrists had predicted prior to the experi- ments that fewer than one-half of one percent of the subject would go all the way to 450 volts on the "shock panel," the actual range in most of the experimental variations was from 30 to 65 percent "fully obedient." Even when the confederate, in an adjoining room, banged on the wall and screamed about his weak heart, begging the subject to stop, 60 percent of the subjects were completely obedient to the ex- perimenter."9 In Milgram's interpretation, this extremely surprising outcome resulted from many of the subjects forsaking their own autonomous judg- ment or "conscience" within the experimental context and entering into an "agentic state." That is, the compliant subjects ceased to eval- uate or feel responsible for their own actions and came to consider themselves solely as obe- dient tools of the scientifically authoritative experimenter (all subjects were told that the experimenter would assume full responsibility for any harm suffered by the "shock victim"). Milgram believes that the rate at which the subjects assumed the "agentic" role indicates that the experiments must have tapped motiva- tional sources too profound to be accounted for wholly in terms of the idiosyncracies of individuals' social conditioning. He turns, there- fore, to evolutionary, biobehavioral theorizing as a mode of explaining his experimental results. Essentially, he stresses the existence and im- portance of dominance structures within many animal societies and the probable survival val- ues of hierarchy-including efficient division of labor, firmness of social organization, and maintenance of internal group order. He be- lieves that natural selection has also built into the human species a propensity to create and maintain hierarchical social relationships, which entails a propensity to learn readily def- erence to authority: " . . . we are born with a potential for obedience, which then interacts with the influence of society to produce the obedient man." When such a person finds him- self in the presence of a perceived authority- figure, his propensity to enter the "agentic 69 Milgram, Obedience to Authority, pp. 30-35.</page><page sequence="13">1122 The American Political Science Review Vol. 70 state" is "exceedingly strong, and the shift is not freely reversible."70 The evolutionary theorizing of the late C. H. Waddington may help clarify further both the phylogenesis and ontogenesis of Milgram's "potential for obedience." Waddington stressed the protracted character of infant and child- hood dependence (a trend that becomes pro- gressively marked in primate species the nearer their evolutionary relationship to man). This dependence is both made possible and required by the human species' very great reliance upon learning as the individual's primary means of developing adaptive behavior. One ability which must be learned is what Bigelow called "self-control." It seems that the mechanism which we have inherited for controlling our own behavior normally involves accepting completely the authority of those on whom we are dependent when very young. The enor- mous dependence of our species upon cultural life, including moral norms, has resulted in the evolution of a tendency to "overlearn" and overgeneralize submissiveness to authority- figures and the norms which they supposedly represent." The evidence and ideas herein discussed that bear upon the dynamics and possible evolved mechanisms of "followership" or submissive behavior appear to provide strong support for Chance's and Larsen's stress upon the impor- tance of the active role of subordinates in the "centripetal attention structure" of a dom- inance hierarchy. It seems quite likely, then, that phylogenetically determined propensities are profoundly influential on both sides of the leader-follower relationship. That hypothesis is strongly supported by a leading theorist of behavioral evolution: "Social individuals must actually inherit a kind of switch mechanism, which allows them to assume either the dom- inant or the subordinate role according to circumstances."72 70 Milgram, pp. 123-125, 134. The possibility that Milgram had instead tapped a hidden wellspring of sadistic aggression is belied by the outcome of one version of his experiment. Subjects were allowed to choose the shock level they would use to punish the "learner." Only one of forty moved all the way up the panel to the "450" switch (ibid., pp. 70-72). 7 C. H. Waddington, The Ethical Animal (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1960), pp. 155-174. Sub- missive obedience can be, of course, horrendously destructive. E.g., note Hannah Arendt's observation that the vaunted aggressive toughness of Nazi SS men was actually, with few exceptions, "nothing but a myth of self-deception, concealing a ruthless desire for conformity at any price . . . " (Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil [New York: Viking Press, 1963], p. 157.) 72V. C. Wynne-Edwards, "Population Control and To this point in my argument I have at- tempted, by discussing behavior, analogies, and theories concerning primate behavior, scientific speculation about man's evolution, and some social phychological evidence and concepts, to indicate why it is at least probable that "it is in the nature of human beings as members of a species to create hierarchical orders, some members of which necessarily constitute an elite."73 Because that hypothesis is very likely to be misunderstood, I should like - before attempt- ing to explore some of its implications for normative political theory - to state as clearly as possible what my argument does not include or imply. I am not asserting that political hier- archies are or ever have been founded exclu- sively on our genetic proclivities; these can only be expressed through particular, distinc- tive, and varying cultural patterns and circum- stances. I do not argue that economic, educa- tional, and family differences among people do not critically affect individuals' placement within political hierarchies. I am not arguing that any single type of dominance hierarchy is the only "natural" pattern; nor do I mean that dominance must necessarily be harsh and re- pressive and involve extremes of stratification. Finally, I am not asserting, nor do I believe, that deliberate attempts to construct or recon- struct orders of political stratification are neces- sarily futile, in any sense "unnatural," or doomed to failure; I very definitely do not mean to imply that whatever is, is inevitable. The last thing I desire is to revivify the justly discredited ideas of "Social Darwinism." The circumstances within which human be- havioral capabilities evolved make it quite un- likely that the normal dominance hierarchy within hominid groups constituted a harsh and repressive tyranny. Our ancestors lived by means of hunting and gathering their food until the development of settled agricultural patterns about 8-10,000 years ago. Our phylo- genetically conditioned behavioral propensities were shaped largely by the exigencies of lead- ing a successful predatory existence."4 Among the requirements of such a life are co-oper- ation and integration of all mature males in the Social Selection in Animals," in Genetics, ed.

In those circumstances, it seems more than likely that "dominance must tend toward the mild 'leadership' type . . . "75 Further, as Tiger and Fox point out, humans must have developed a profound need for sig- nificant participation in face-to-face groups. Thus, they aver, we are so often frustrated by the remoteness and impersonality of bureau- cracy because it is premised on a denial of our craving for a "primate politics" which involves dealing with a few well-known persons face-to- face. Yet bureaucracy -made possible by the symbolizing abilities of the cerebral cortex, the most recently evolved part of the human brain - persists. It does so not only because of its functional indispensability in complex indus- trialized societies but because its structure builds upon other motivations which were es- sential for a successful hunting life - loyalty and orderliness, a sense of belonging to an in- group and hostility to outgroups, hierarchy and competition. Possible Normative Implications But however mild or harsh particular dom- inance structures may be or need to be, some kind of dominance will exist in any human society, along with deferential and obedient patterns of behavior. The evolutionary, primate behavior-based argument for this conclusion is clearly summarized by Jerome H. Barkow: How do we know . . . that human prestige-striving and nonhuman primate social dominance really share a common origin, that is, are homologous? Since our ancestors were nonhuman primates and primates exhibit social ranking, our ancestors pre- sumably were socially ranked. We evolved from these ancestors while organized in cooperative bands of hunters and gatherers . . ., and organiza- tion implies social ranking. It would seem that at no point during our phylogenesis did we lack social hierarchy. If human and nonhuman social domi- nance have apparently been continuous, they must 75 William Etkin, Social Behavior from Fish to Man (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, Phoenix Books, 1967), p. 140. " Tiger and Fox, The Imperial Animal, pp. 48-51. Therefore it seems likely that, in evolutionary terms, "consent" is as old as, in fact coterminous with, "com- mand" in human authority structures. This may be viewed as some degree of validation of Hannah Arendt's insight into the "elementary dynamics" of political life - namely, her recurrent emphasis upon the spontaneity of small-scale participatory political groups during most modern revolutionary upheavals and her insistence upon popular consent as the.basis of effective political power. See Hannah Arendt, On Revolution (New York: Viking Press, 1963), esp. pp. 259-285; Arendt, "Reflections on Violence," Journal of International Affairs, 23, 1 (1969), 14-15. necessarily be homologous. Cultural systems of social rank are based on, not opposed to, our primate heritage." It thus seems probable that Thomas Aquinas's Aristotelian view is correct: " . . . it is natural for man, more than for any other animal, to be a social and political animal, to live in a group. . . . If, then, it is natural for man to live in the society of many, it is necessary that there exist among men some means by which the group may be governed."78 I would suggest that this conclusion provides us with a reasonably secure hypothetical basis for theorizing about political obligation and about the problems of shaping political insti- tutions to be optimally responsive to human needs and demands. In the remainder of this discussion, I shall focus primarily on political obligation. The great progenitors of modern political thought - Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau - share a critical premise: the radically artificial, contrived, contingent character of any and all political authority. Despite the very important differences among them, all three theorists deny that structures of dominance and defer- ence inhere in human nature and concur on the fundamental significance of the question, what can possibly justify the existence of any kind of political authority and obligation? The answer common to all three: only the consent of individuals. Hobbes and Locke severely qualified this principle for the sake of political order and stability (Hobbes in fact almost, but not quite, qualified it out of existence.) Rousseau, how- ever, attempted in an absolutely serious and literal way to make of it the sole foundation of the polity. Man was originally free - inde- pendent, individually isolated except for brief encounters; by virtue of haphazard circum- stances developed small-scale societies of mu- tual accord; but then fell into the chains of extreme dependence and servitude because of the effects of covetousness as manifested in private property.79 We now know, of course, as Rousseau could not, that every primate spe- cies lives within some kind of ordered social group, and that man was never absolutely "free" in the sense of complete isolation and 77 Jerome H. Barkow, "Prestige and Culture: A Biosocial Interpretation," Current Anthropology, 16 (December, 1975), 554. S St. Thomas Aquinas, On Kingship, in The Political Ideas of St. Thomas Aquinas, ed.

Nevertheless, Rousseau was led to set im- possible conditions for the legitimacy of au- thority (though he considered it wise ordinarily to obey all de facto authority"). From premises like Rousseau's it was logical to conclude, as nineteenth-century anarchists and many social- ists did, that putting an end to economic in- equality and proletarian servitude would even- tually bring the "withering away" of political authority. The government of men will be re- placed by the administration of things, as "The society that will organize production on the basis of a free and equal association of the pro- ducers will put the whole machinery of state where it will then belong: into the museum of antiquities, by the side of the spinning wheel and the bronze ax."82 In no way do I underestimate or denigrate the great contributions of political theorists from Hobbes to Marx toward discrediting and undermining the authority of anachronistic, oppressive, and dysfunctional hierarchies. But a generalized and possibly justified suspicion of all political authorities is not really an ade- quate reason for remaining attached to beliefs which seem to bear little or no relationship to empirical reality. For a specific recent example of such a view- point, consider Robert Paul Wolff's ideas on political obligation."3 He assumes that all men "'Sherwood L. Washburn and David A.

Feuer (Garden City, New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1959), p. 394. It should be noted that Engels did not believe that all hierarchical authority would disappear under communism. In an essay on authority, he asserted that authority in the factory was a func- tional requirement of industrial production and thus unavoidable. In the same essay, however, Engels re- iterated: 'All socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of so- ciety."

" Robert Paul Wolff, ln Defense of Anarchism (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1970). have free will and reason, are thereby respon- sible for their choices, and hence have a right to wholly autonomous individual self- governance. Even more relentlessly consistent than Rousseau, Wolff concludes that "all au- thority is equally illegitimate, although of course not therefore equally worthy or un- worthy of support. . . . There would appear to be no state whose subjects have a moral ob- ligation to obey its commands."'s4 Presumably Wolff does not mean his theory of political obligation to be counterempirical and thus, I believe, an irrelevant fantasy, for elsewhere he reveals a peculiar conception of man's relationship to nature: " . . . while the natural world really does exist independently of man's beliefs or desires, and therefore exer- cises a constraint on his will which can at best be mitigated or combatted, the social world is nothing in itself, and consists merely of the totality of the habits, expectations, beliefs, and behavior patterns of all the individuals who live in it.""s5 But it is the fundamental premise of evolutionary biology that man's social be- havior is totally a part of the "natural world." If one does not assume the "social world" to be supernatural, it can only be "natural." And, given man's primate social nature, there seems to be no more reason to base a normative the- ory on the assumption that political stratifica- tion and authority are contingent and ulti- mately dispensable than to spend one's life pondering the consequences for society of a dramatic mutation which would suddenly per- mit every human being to fly without mechan- ical assistance. Neither project is likely to get off the ground. The realistic starting point for thinking about political obligation would appear to be not the question, what can justify authority per se, but a question something like this: What kind(s) of authority structure can be justified under what types of political and social cir- cumstances? In itself, political authority is neither legitimate nor illegitimate; it simply is.86 In a sense, I am implying the need for an Aristotelian approach to political theory. I do not at all mean that one could or should accept Aristotle's metaphysical premises, ethical sys- tem, or political conclusions -but rather that one might set out from the now well-grounded premise that man is by nature a political animal and concentrate one's efforts upon trying to S4 Ibid., p. 19. 85Ibid., p. 76.

Finally, this quasi-Aristotelian biobehavioral perspective on authority and political stratifi- cation seems likely to inspire concern about discovering and preserving effective restraints upon the wielders of political authority. If one believes that hierarchical authority is a histor- ically bounded phenomenon that will disappear in the socially transformed future, one will oppose overweening and arbitrary authority only until one's own movement or party gains absolute power (Leninism is the overwhelm- ingly relevant example). But if one believes to the contrary that political authority structures are very likely to exist, no matter what move- ment or party rules or what kinds of socioeco- nomic transformations occur, then one will consider the structure and operations of the authority system to be a problem of both press- ing and permanent significance -especially for the great majority of people who are not members of a "central hierarchy." Referring again to subhuman primate be- havior, one should note in this context the in- tricately adaptive nature of dominance in spe- cies such as the savanna baboons. The central hierarchy males keep order within the troop, protect females and their offspring from pred- ators, lead troop movement, and apparently do most of the breeding - passing on the genetic components of their greater than average ca- pacities for co-operation, intelligent leadership, and aggressive defense. Thus males who achieve dominance invariably behave so as to protect the best interests of the troop as a whole. It is more than evident that in groups and societies of our species this kind of automatic fit between success in dominance competition and effective substantive leadership no longer exists. Presumably a baboon-like congruence between them was present during the hundreds of thousands of millennia when our ancestors lived in small groups which could not survive without effective leadership and co-ordination of efforts in hunting, food-sharing, and group protection. But in populous, complex societies, political authorities are usually removed from the immediate contexts in which their decisions are implemented. They do not therefore get immediate or necessarily reliable feedback on their w i s d o m or effectiveness - something which no prehistoric hunter chief could avoid when he and his group either fed well or went hungry. The transferring of authority structures from the context of face-to-face interaction to that of an ultra-symbolic remoteness also makes it much more difficult for the governed to de- termine how their own condition is actually affected by the decisions of political authori- ties.8" And, of course, historical experience in- dicates that individuals who achieve high political rank may be too ignorant, arrogant, insensitive, or incompetent to cope satisfactorily with important social problems. Yet dominance structures there will be in social groupings of the human species, and therefore discovering methods to make and keep them responsive to the substantive needs and desires of the society as a whole is a peren- nial dilemma. Although our complex societies have lost the automatic fit between dominance and adaptiveness typical of primate groups in their normal habitats, there has been in man an enormous development of a relevant general- ized trait characteristic of nearly all primate species -the ability to learn how to adapt to varied circumstances.88 Using that ability and building, no doubt, on our evolved capacity for self-control, men long ago learned and taught the desirability of subjecting the dominant as well as the subordinate to the restraint of cus- tom and then to the more rationalized "rule of law": "Man, when perfected, is the best of ani- mals; but if he be isolated from law and justice he is the worst of all.""8 And, from an evolu- tionary perspective: Laws and social customs are not unnatural im- positions from a source somewhere outside biol- ogy. They arise from interactions between the cerebral cortex and other parts of a single body, and from interactions between the brains and eyes 87 See Murray Edelman, The Symbolic Uses of Politics (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1964). 8s E.g., female savanna baboons were placed within a group of hamadryas baboons; within an hour each female had learned to remain near and follow the male which had threatened or attacked her. This is normal behavior for a hamadryas female but precisely opposite the usual behavior of a female savanna baboon among males of her own species. Conversely, hamadryas females placed among savanna baboons soon learned not to follow individual males as these females had always done among their own kind. (Kummer, Primate Societies, pp. 99-100.) The example cited above (fn. 41 ) of a rank order change in a chimpanzee group can be viewed as an individual's learning to use a newly available resource -noise- making tin cans -as a device to inhibit the dom- inance behavior of* the. alpha male, making it pos- sible for the innovator to rise quickly to the top of the group hierarchy. 89 Aristotle Politics 1253a, trans.

A continuing concern with what Madison called the "auxiliary precautions" of constitutionalism9" will not appear to be the trivial and irrelevant diversion of a decadent bourgeois liberalism if one assumes that we can, within indeterminate limits, choose the kind of authority structure by which we will be governed but that if we do not concern our- selves with that choice, it will inexorably be made for us. 90 Bigelow, p. 24. 91 The Federalist, No. 51.</page></plain_text>
