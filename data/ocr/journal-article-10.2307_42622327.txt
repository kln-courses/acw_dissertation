The many diverse aspects of this society have been approached in a compre- hensive way, including study of the geo- political organization, the form and function of ideology, the structure of iconographie communication systems, and the settlement and burial patterns. The majority of these studies, however, have centered on the Moche III and IV chronological phases, and especially complex sites such as Sipán, Huaca de la Luna, the El Brujo complex, and Cerro Mayal. These projects have allowed us to focus on the period of the greatest development of this society, as well as the forms and styles that characterize its artistic expressions (Alva 1994; Alva and Donnan 1993; Franco, Gálvez, and Vasquez 1994; Russell and Leonard 1994,- Uceda and Mujica 1994). The San José de Moro Archaeological Pro- ject, in contrast, has focused on late Moche development in the Jequetepeque Valley (fig. i).1 This emphasis has resulted in theoretical and empirical approaches that differ from what has prevailed in other studies. For example, the theme of social collapse, or political and ideological management of a society in crisis, is a fundamental issue for us. In this article I intend to approach such issues apparent in Late Moche society. This study will begin in the Middle Moche period, and carry through to the what we have defined as the Transitional period, which includes the end of Moche (c. a.d. 800) to the Lambayeque conquest of the Jequetepeque Valley (c. a.d. 950). To place this within a broader Andean framework, it concerns the Early Intermedi- ate to Middle Horizon periods. San José de Moro offers exceptional con- ditions for the study of the evolution of funer- ary and ceremonial practices. Our sources of information are doubly rich, as in addition to the burials we have an extraordinary corpus of vessels with fine-line paintings on them found in graves. In the evolving funerary pat- terns and their related ceremonies and ce- ramics, we can see a rich history of cultural influences, of strategies for power based on complex ideological manipulations, and the absorption of, or resistance to, the pressures of foreign societies. Before beginning the analysis of the San José de Moro data, I wish to note two theo- retical assumptions inherent in our research regarding Moche geopolitical organization and the chronological and regional ceramic sequences. First, Moche territory was divided into two clearly defined regions. The north- ern Moche region included the Piura, Lam- bayeque and Jequetepeque valleys, which coexisted with greater or lesser political inde- pendence among them (Castillo and Donnan 1994b; Donnan and Cock 1986). The south- ern Moche region included the Chicama and Moche valleys as a nuclear zone, while the Virú, Chao, Santa, and Nepeña valleys were 307</page><page sequence="3">i . General view of the San José de Moro excavation Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra incorporated through military conquest (Wil- ley 1953). Secondly, the ceramic sequence of the Jequetepeque Valley is different from the southern Moche region, which has been divided into five phases by Larco (1948). The ceramic sequence in Jequetepeque, however, comprises three periods: Early Moche, corre- sponding to Phases I and II in the south; Mid- dle Moche, contemporaneous with Phase III and part of Phase IV; and Late Moche, coeval with the end of Phase IV and Phase V. In the Jequetepeque Valley, the Late Moche period is followed by the Transitional period and finally the Lambayeque occupation. This sequence, apparently, could also apply to Moche ceramic evolution in Lambayeque and Piura (Castillo and Donnan 1994b). The Collapse of Moche Society Only three projects have systematically studied the Late Moche period: the Pampa Grande Project directed by Kent Day and Izumi Shimada (Shimada 1994); Garth Baw- den's Galindo study (this volume, and 1977, 1982), and the San José de Moro Archaeo- logical Project. Otherwise, any additional information we have comes from numerous isolated finds, often come across accidentally. These include tombs, mural paintings, and ceramic and metal objects, some of which have entered museum collections throughout the world. Settlement pattern studies not solely centered on the Late Moche period have also contributed to our understanding of the occupational history of various valleys or regions (Proulx 1973; Russell 1990; Willey I95 3; Wilson 1988, among others). Societal collapse marked the fundamental character of the Late Moche period. In the literature, three factors have been suggested for the demise of the Moche: environmental instability at the end of the sixth century a.D.; the influence of Wari, an expansionist polity of the Middle Horizon period based in the southern highlands, and societies related to them; and finally, an internal collapse of Moche society, particularly its political and ideological structures. The authors who have studied this period emphasize one or the other of these factors. Thus, while Shimada (1994; Shimada et. al. 199 1 ) gives priority to environmental factors, Bawden (1996), Castillo and Donnan (1994a) incline more toward the internal weakness of Moche so- ciety. Nevertheless, it has become more 308 CASTILLO</page><page sequence="4">evident that the role of Wari cultural diffu- sion is contingent upon the other two; in other words, Wari had an influence on the north coast only after the Moche governing elite were debilitated, which could only have happened through the combination of the other two factors. Our capacity for under- standing the impact of the Wari phenomenon is limited, as we have no clear idea of the mechanisms of cultural interaction between Wari and other regional groups related to it, let alone their interactions with populations of the north coast. Many questions remain unanswered about the character of Wari, par- ticularly its peculiar form of dispersion in the central Andes. The evidence considered here leads us to believe that Wari had an indirect presence on the north coast, a primarily ideo- logical influence that was mediated through other societies. This mediation seems to have had two forms: Wari symbols and ideas were reelaborated by geographically intermediate societies along the central coast and northern highlands and through these areas arrived at the Jequetepeque Valley,- and secondly, these societies served as distributing agents of arti- facts originally produced in the south. Various investigators have discussed the internal weakness of Late Moche society. Shi- mada (1994) assumes that a latent social con- flict existed, generated by the politics of an oppressive elite who dominated other ethnic villages, which would finally have resulted in rebellion against the oppressors. In contrast, Bawden (1996) explains the internal weakness as an effect of a structural flaw, which was inevitably produced by the inherent contra- dictions of Moche political ideology. On the one hand, this ideology tended to favor the elite,- on the other, it was confronted by intrinsic Andean tenets of reciprocity and solidarity. Bawden interprets the site plan of Galindo, a typical Phase V site in the Moche Valley, as the physical expression of these conflicts among segments of the society, where the elite isolated themselves from the common people through large walls and por- tals that simultaneously controlled access between barrios, or neighborhoods, and exer- cised control of stored resources. Such external and internal pressures could have accelerated a crisis in Late Moche so- ciety. Various authors have argued that two important changes occurred in settlement patterns at this time. First, the most impor- tant population centers were found at the necks of the valleys, so as to control the canal intakes of the irrigation systems (Moseley 1 992). 2 Secondly, moving the capital of the supposed Moche state from the Huaca de la Luna and the Huaca del Sol in the Moche Valley to Pampa Grande in the Lambayeque Valley would have aggravated the crisis. Unfortunately, there are still insufficient data to support this second hypothesis. As the San José de Moro Archaeological Project has been focusing most recently on ceremonial and funerary aspects of the site, we have not yet had time to study the en- vironmental history of the site, although to date we have encountered little evidence of dramatic environmental upheaval. In spite of the lack of evidence so far, we suspect that climatic instability played a role in the for- tunes of Moche society. Climatic instability, however, seems to have had a greater influ- ence on the transition between the Middle and Late Moche periods than in the Moche collapse. Fortunately, this factor is being studied in the Jequetepeque Valley by other researchers (Dillehay, this volume). We have been emphasizing investigation of the two remaining factors: Wari influence and the internal deterioration of Moche society. San José de Moro The San José de Moro Archaeological Project differs from other projects that have studied late Moche society because of the site's peculiar nature. While Galindo and Pampa Grande are habitational sites that include monumental ceremonial structures and were occupied for only a short period of time, San José de Moro was essentially a cemetery and ceremonial center continuously occupied for more than a thousand years. San José de Moro's occupational history began in the Middle Moche period and lasted through the Inca conquest, with its most dense occu- pation occurring in the Late Moche and Tran- sitional periods. As looters have destroyed many of the structures that existed at the site, we focused on a series of flat areas, perhaps ritual plazas, located in front of mounds. Between 199 1 and 1992, we excavated the area in front of Huaca de la Capilla, where we found five large tomb castillo 309</page><page sequence="5">2.

Cluster of Moche tombs in 1996-1998 excavations units Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra grouped together. We have registered concen- trations of Middle Moche, Late Moche, and Lambayeque period elite graves as well as graves of lesser status. Many of the graves seem to have external markers, allowing us to identify clusters of tombs, usually arranged in lines or circles (figs. 3, 4). In this fashion, we have been able to follow groupings of up to six elite burials. Apparently ritual activities were celebrated on the grounds surrounding the tombs. We have found alignments of adobe bricks that delineate rectangular spaces. The adobe bricks did not form structural walls, as we found one or two lines of bricks without foundations. It would seem that these were used only to delimit ritual space. Within these spaces we found groups of ceramics, including large ceramic storage vessels, or paicas, placed in line or in clusters (fig. 5). The paicas were probably used for the prepa- ration of chicha (maize beer), or some other product. In addition to the tombs and ceremonial spaces at San José de Moro, we have studied the occupational mounds. They show a very complex stratification, beginning with the Middle Moche period and culminating with the Chimú occupation (Castillo and Donnan 1994a; Rosas 1999). These have already been reported by Disselhoff (1958a, b) and Chodoff (1979), both of whom did early stratigraphie excavations at the site.

One should note that in the stratigraphie profiles, however, "fine" ceramics rarely appear. The Moche at San José de Moro While the beginning of the Moche occupation at San José de Moro in the Middle Moche period is relatively easy to define, the precise end of Moche is more difficult to discern, as a clear Moche influence can be detected in contexts that would generally be considered post-Moche chronologically. In the following sections I present evidence on Late Moche society at San José de Moro, and propose some hypotheses to explain the data. I will begin with a discussion of the Middle Moche period in order to identify the antecedents to the Late period. My conclusions with respect to the Transitional period are still preliminary, as data are still being discovered and analyzed. The Middle Moche Period According to the Jequetepeque Valley ceramic sequence (Donnan and Castillo 1994), the Middle Moche period is a distinct cultural phenomenon, and not a local variant of the Moche III period as described by Larco (1948). Phase III of the southern Moche region is characterized by higher- quality ceramics, which are finely modeled and painted with pictorial designs. Based on stylistic and chronological criteria, we think that Middle Moche was contemporaneous with Phase III and possibly part of Phase IV in the south, although we have still not been able to estab- lish firm correspondences. Data for this period in the Jequetepeque Valley come from excavations at San José de Moro and Pacatnamú, the latter carried out by Ubbelohde-Doering in 1938 (1983) and Donnan and Cock more recently (1986, 1997b). At San José de Moro, we have located sixteen tombs belonging to this period, all of which correspond to a type known as a boot- shaped tomb. These consist of a vertical pit of variable depth (from 0.5 m to 2 m) that ends in a lateral funerary chamber, very restricted in height and width. Although organic preser- vation is very poor, it appears that individuals 5 . Cluster of paicas Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra were wrapped in thick cloth and laid out over reed mats. Some fiber bands were fixed at pelvis height to what seems to have been a semirigid mat. These were perhaps used to hold the body in place. The funerary cham- bers seem to have been filled with clean sand before they were sealed with walls of adobe bricks. In general, adobe bricks associated with Middle Moche tombs are thin (approxi- mately 12 cm) and show signs of mold manu- facture, compared with Late Moche bricks, which are double in thickness. Finally, the entrance of the vertical pit was filled. Recently, we have been able to document a number of paicas as tomb markers. These paicas appear in the fill at the mouth of the tomb, perhaps jutting out slightly over an occupation floor, and would have been used during funerary rituals to seal the tomb, and for subsequent offerings or celebrations. In some cases, the burnt remains of camelid bones were discovered in the paicas. A unique feature of Middle Moche tombs at San José de Moro is that most contain a single fine ceramic piece, usually a stirrup- spout bottle. Only two burials contained simple artifacts, such as cooking vessels or 312 CASTILLO</page><page sequence="8">jars, and these were in limited numbers, par- ticularly when compared with the quantity of ceramics seen in Late Moche tombs. The ceramics are typically located near the body, beside the head or at the feet, occasionally on top of the body. More than eighty burials have been located at Pacatnamú in two areas of Moche occu- pation,- the majority can be attributed to the Middle Moche period. In 1938 Ubbelohde- Doering (1983) found a series of Moche tombs in the area around Huaca 31; Donnan and Cock (1997b) later located a Moche cemetery of the same period that they designated H45CM1. These two cemeteries are very dif- ferent in terms of the type of tombs they con- tained. The cemetery found by Ubbelohde- Doering would seem to be of elite individuals, given the presence of multiple superficial pit tombs and three enormous boot-shaped tombs excavated in the rubble, with many varied artifactual associations.3 The tombs of the H45CM1 cemetery pertain to individuals from the lower levels of society, possibly peasants and fishermen; hence they include only very simple offerings such as domestic ceramics, fragments of metal artifacts and worn textiles. The Middle Moche period tombs found at San José de Moro seem to cor- respond to an intermediate social segment, as they are not as rich and complex as some from the Huaca 3 1 cemetery, but contain generally finer ceramics than those found at H45CM1. The similarities between the Middle Moche ceramics found at Pacatnamú and those at San José de Moro are undeniable, to the point that some pieces from both sites could have come from the same mold (fig. 6). In contrast to San José de Moro, however, the Pacatnamú tombs contained large quantities of ceramic vessels of domestic and mid-grade quality. As we analyzed the Middle Moche ce- ramics from both sites, it became apparent that ceramics painted with elaborate fine-line pictorial decoration did not exist. A very advanced use of lineal design with narrative iconographie scenes was developing in Phases III and IV in the southern Moche region, yet it seems to be absent in the north. The most complex decorative motifs in Jequetepeque were figures painted with thick lines on the vessel bodies (Donnan and McClelland 1997: figs. 10a, i ob, and 12b). In addition to the cream and ochre slips, and in contrast to 6.

Another characteristic of Middle Moche ceramics is the presence of vessels with deco- rative details showing a clear continuity with the earlier Virú or Gallinazo style, particu- larly eyes rendered with lines and incised dots, "tears," and other facial features charac- teristic of this style (Donnan and McClelland 1997: 3 id, 108, 205). Influence from the Virú culture in Middle Moche ceramics is congruent with findings by Donnan at Dos Cabezas and Mazanca (Donnan and Cock 1995, 1996, 1997a; Don- nan, personal communication, 1999) and sug- gests that the Moche style could have derived from a Virú culture substratum. This sub- stratum did not disappear as the Moche style was crystallizing, but persisted as a substyle within the varieties of Moche art. This stylis- tic line persists to the Late period, in addition to others that seem more familiarly Moche. Not only are there no Middle Moche fine- line ceramics at San José de Moro, there appears to be little or no influence in the ceramics from contemporary external sources. There is no discernable stylistic affinity with Cajamarca ceramics, which is somewhat sur- prising given the proximity of this highland culture to Jequetepeque. Nor is there evi- dence of stylistic borrowings or exchange of imagery from cultures of the central coast. Moreover, there seems to be no connection castillo 313</page><page sequence="9">with the Moche III ceramics of the Chicama and Moche valleys. The Middle Moche ceramics are technologically very simple and less refined than those of the southern region, and show a continuity with simple forms of Early Moche in the northern region (see Castillo andDonnan 1994a: 162-169). The lack of elaborate pictorial decoration and the overall poorer quality of the wares are characteristic of the Middle period of northern Moche ceramics. This includes the Middle Moche site of Sipán, where the extraordinary quality of the goldwork con- trasts with the relatively poor quality of the ceramics.4 These facts only reaffirm ques- tions surrounding the origins of the elaborate pictorial styles that characterize the fine-line ceramics of the Late Moche period in the northern Moche area. The Late Moche Period To date, one of the most difficult processes to understand has been the transition from Mid- dle Moche to Late Moche periods in the Jequetepeque Valley. The sudden appearance of fine-line ceramics, which characterized the Late period, particularly at San José de Moro, was unexplained. As we will see, focusing almost exclusively on the origin and evo- lution of fine-line ceramics distracted us from understanding the true nature of the tran- sition. The data under consideration now indicate that a fluid transition existed be- tween these periods,- however, the Late period appearance of fine-line ceramics may be the result of outside influences. Our data on Late period Moche occupation in the Jequetepeque Valley come from graves at Pacatnamú (Ubbelohde-Doering 1983) and thirty-nine tombs and other contexts in San José de Moro (Castillo and Donnan 1994a, 1994b; Castillo, Mackey, and Nelson 1996, 1997, 1998). The tombs represent a wide range of social positions and functions, from the extremely elaborate tombs of the Priest- esses of Moro (Donnan and Castillo 1994a) to the very simple pit tombs with no artifacts. The most common tombs for this period, however, are still boot-shaped tombs sealed with adobe bricks. The close relationship between archaeo- logy and iconography has led to considerable advances in understanding funerary customs of Late Moche society. Beginning with the study of the funerary associations, it is possi- ble to recognize two individuals buried at San José de Moro wearing the regalia of a person- age known from Moche iconography as the Priestess (Donnan and Castillo 1994). In the iconography, the Priestess appears as a partic- ipant in a number of ritual scenes, particu- larly those of prisoner sacrifice and presenta- tion (Introduction to this volume, fig. 5; Alva andDonnan 1993: fig. 143, chapter V; Donnan 1978: 158-173), the Revolt of the Objects (Lyon 1 98 1; Quilter 1990), and maritime scenes, such as the image of the Priestess rid- ing a reed raft or crescent moon (Cordy- Collins 1977). It is noteworthy that the women buried at San José de Moro had coffins decorated with some of the implements asso- ciated with the Priestess, such a headdress with serrated-edge extensions (fig. 2). One coffin contained a pedestal cup, an item closely associated with the Priestess in the Presentation Scene (fig. 7). Based on this evi- dence, we infer that during their lives these women fulfilled the role of the Priestess, per- haps conducting rituals similar to the ones depicted on the ceramics, or at the very least, they were intimately related to it, to the extent of being buried with the Priestess7 attributes. This association between the Moche elite and the most important figures 7.

Architectural model from San José de Moro Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo seen in the iconography is not new, as the tomb of the Lord of Sipán included the same sort of regalia seen in depictions of the princi- pal figure of the Sacrifice Ceremony (Alva, this volume; Alva and Donnan 1993). To date, no other burial found at San José de Moro has been associated with personages known from the iconography, but the possibility remains that others will be discovered in the future. Perhaps more important than the precise identification of religious entities in these tombs is the confirmation that the Moche elite had a clear relationship to ritual special- ists and the divine. By the standards of most sites, the Priest- esses' burials were quite complex for their time. The grave goods included not only the artifacts previously mentioned, but also im- ported ceramics, sacrificed individuals, and a significant number of ceramic vessels, in- cluding a type of small vessel known as a crisol . Other chamber tombs included archi- tectural models made of unfired clay, origi- nally painted in bright colors (fig. 8). The models represent rectangular, roofed struc- tures with platforms, patios, benches, ramps and corridors (Castillo, Nelson, and Nelson 1997). In spite of this, when we compare these Moche elite burials with their counterparts of the Early and Middle periods (Sipán, La Mina, Loma Negra, Dos Cabezas), there is a surpris- ing absence of gold and silver artifacts. In earlier periods, it is common to find a high concentration of gold crowns, headdresses and adornments, and copper figurines in elite tombs. Not only is there a lack of precious metals, but also a general decrease in metal artifacts. The majority of the burials located at San José de Moro do not correspond to the highest echelon of Moche society, who were presum- ably buried in the chamber tombs we found. The second rank of elites were generally buried in boot-shaped tombs. Individuals were buried in an extended, supine position, with the majority placed with their heads ori- ented to the south. This pattern is main- tained not only until the end of the Late 9.

Face-neck jars (jars with an effigy mod- eled on the neck of the vessel), flasks with small lateral handles, open-mouth jars, and slightly fired crisoles still predominate. Of course, new forms appear in the Late period, while others disappear (fig. 9). Forms rare in the Middle period, such as small flat-based jars with slightly streamlined bodies and flared neck, become very popular. Some important changes occurred with domestic 316 CASTILLO ceramics; for example, jars with composite necks typical of Middle Moche are replaced by the highly diagnostic jars with platform rims (fig. 9, c). Some forms have a singular longevity and continue through different periods; such is the case of the face-neck jars with a modeled arm or arms projecting over the face, covering the mouth or an eye (fig. 10). This form is known in earlier Virú or Gal- linazo ceramics and appears in late contexts at Pacatnamú, San José de Moro and Pampa Grande.6 In summary, for mid-grade ceramics, we do not see a rupture between the Middle and Late phases, but rather a clear continuity, with evolving forms, disappearing forms, and emerging modalities based on older forms.</page><page sequence="12">The Appearance of Fine-Line Style in Northern Moche Sites An innovation of the Late period is the irrup- tion of what we call, after McClelland (1990), the fine-line iconographie style characteristic of the Late Moche phase in the Jequetepeque Valley and in particular at San José de Moro. This style has received much attention for its formal and technological quality and its elaborate narrative iconography (Donnan and McClelland 1979, 1999; McClelland 1990). Intricate scenes, usually painted in red slip on a cream-colored base, cover the body and often the neck of stirrup-spout vessels. A vari- ant appears in the double-spout-and-bridge vessels (Larco 1966a: figs. 108, 109; Rowe 1942) and in the stirrup-spout ceramics deco- rated with Moche iconography, albeit in poly- chrome (Shimada 1994: fig. 9.1). Examples of vessels with fine-line deco- ration have been reported occasionally at southern Moche sites, like El Carmelo (Larco 1966a: figs. 106, 107), the El Brujo complex, and Cerro Mayal (personal communication, Régulo Franco and Glenn Russell respec- tively), as well as at sites farther afield such as Paredones in Lima (Stumer 1958) and in the Piura Valley (Larco 1966a: 107). Additionally, at Pampa Grande some vessels have been reported in ceremonial and production con- texts (Shimada 1994: figs. 7.35.C, 8.12.B, and 9.7). Nevertheless, the great majority of the scientifically excavated vessels, and almost all of those without provenance that have ended up in museum and private collections, are believed to originate from San José de Moro. As was stated at the beginning of this sec- tion, the fine-line style does not have ante- cedents in the Middle Moche period of the Jequetepeque Valley, and therefore does not appear to have developed locally. We do not find ceramics with pictorial decoration that we could call transitional between the Mid- dle and Late periods. We had thought that this missing transition could be attributed to a gap in the sequence - we had simply not found the layers of occupation or tombs reflecting the transition between the Middle and Late periods. However, in investigations conducted by Marco Rosas (1999) at San José de Moro in six stratigraphie cuts of 6 m depth, we did not find a single interruption in the sequence. Instead, there was extensive evi- dence of occupational continuity, under- scoring the stylistic continuum of the mid- grade ceramics. Nor do there exist examples in local or national collections that could be attributed to a transitory phase between the Middle and Late Moche ceramics. In other words, the sequence is apparently correct, and fine-line ceramics did not evolve within it, but instead appeared suddenly. If this is the case, there is a need to define the origin of the fine-line style in the Jequetepeque Valley. Middle Moche period ceramics of the Lam- bayeque and Piura valleys, as with those of the Jequetepeque Valley, are not elaborately decorated. In his article on the lords of Loma Negra, Makowski presents a series of ceramic vessels, which he attributes to Late Moche A and Late Moche B periods (Makowski 1994: figs. 89-91), contemporaneous with Middle Moche of Jequetepeque. We can see how sim- ple the pictorial designs of this region are, hence it is probably correct to assume that this style would not lead to the elaborate fine- line style of San José de Moro. Neither can we find antecedents for these styles developing in the Cajamarca highlands to the east of Jequetepeque. There, the most elaborate cur- sive styles do not appear until after the Moche decline, suggesting that the Late Moche influenced Cajamarca. CASTILLO 317</page><page sequence="13">If the fine-line style did not evolve from the seat of Moche culture at Jequetepeque or from the north or the east, it is important to examine carefully the possibility of a south- ern origin. We are confronted with a chrono- logical problem in this line of investigation, as we do not know with certainty when the style began developing, or what was occur- ring simultaneously in the southern Moche territory. In the current state of investigations, one can only presume that the beginning of the Late Moche period in the northern Moche region is contemporaneous with the end of Moche IV and the beginning of Phase V in the southern Moche region. Tomb MXII exca- vated at Pacatnamú by Ubbelohde-Doering (1983: 111-122) constitutes the only link be- tween these two traditions, as it contains six apparently imported pieces that correspond to the transitional style between Phases IV and V in Larco's seriation. These vessels appear to be related to intermediate and domestic ceramics of the Late Moche style of the north. As has been stated previously, however, this tomb is particularly complex and contained two occupations, one origi- nally pertaining to the Middle Moche period, and the other intrusive, pertaining to the Late period. If our interpretation is correct, this context could help us to situate the beginning of Late Moche with the beginning of Larco's Moche V phase of the southern Moche. If we accept that fine-line style influences came from the south, it is important to con- sider how this may have come about. Was this stylistic transfer merely the effect of an artistic influence, based on the exchange of objects rather than people? Or does the sud- den appearance of this refined and mature style indicate the result of a migration of arti- sans trained in workshops of the south, into Jequetepeque? Was it the result of a conquest of the Jequetepeque Valley by the southern Moche state? The least intrusive option, that of a move- ment of objects rather than people, seems highly improbable, as it would have been difficult to improvise the technical and artis- tic capacities required to fabricate fine-line pieces based solely on imitation or a "quick course" in ceramic iconography. The most intrusive option, a conquest of the Jequete- peque Valley by the southern Moche state, does not seem probable, as the evidence for southerners in Jequetepeque is limited to a single intrusive burial and there are no other changes in material production. Significantly, Ubbelohde-Doering's Tomb MXII at Pacat- namú is confirmation that the politically independent northern Moche and southern Moche states maintained open routes of com- munication and exchange. Given the sudden appearance of a style clearly mature in all its artistic and icono- graphie aspects, we are inclined to believe some migration was necessary: highly trained southern artisans moved to the Jequetepeque Valley. They would have brought with them all of the iconographie themes and technical skills for the production and decoration of these high-quality ceramics. It is possible that more than a single artist arrived, and a complete workshop produced these ceramics, albeit under the supervision of the lords of Jequetepeque. Nevertheless, things may not have been quite so simple. The artists would have adapted to the peculiarities of Moche society in the Jequetepeque, and in the process, as we will see, a series of important changes occurred in the iconographie reper- toire and ceramic style. In summary, we are inclined to believe that the Jequetepeque elites were not re- placed, nor were their territories conquered by societies from the south. If this had been the case, we would see a more definite pres- ence of the southern Moche ceramic and iconographie repertoire in the local styles. In spite of the appearance of fine-line ceramics, however, there is an enormous quantity of mid-grade and domestic ceramics being pro- duced according to local canons. What oc- curred then is the adoption of a very re- stricted aspect of the southern tradition - the pictorial style. Contextual Evidence of the Fine-Line Style at San José de Moro Fine-line ceramics appear in the San José de Moro burials in singular conditions. They are relatively scarce: the Late Moche tombs, in- cluding the most elaborate ones, contain only one or two pieces of this style. This includes the chamber tombs of the Priestesses, which had only two and four pieces of the fine-line style (Tomb M-U41 and M-U103 respec- tively). The limited number of fine-line 318 CASTILLO</page><page sequence="14">1 1 . Late Moche tomb typical of San José de Moro (M- 112409), where one can see the combination of different ceramic types Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra pieces in Late Moche tombs is analogous to what we have described for the Middle period, where we found only one stirrup- spout vessel per tomb. In the Late period tombs, we also found a great quantity of mid- grade and domestic ceramics.7 Apparently the number of fine-line pieces that an individual could receive as a funerary offering was limi- ted. The presence, and not the number of pieces, implied a certain status. There also seems to be a particular logic to the combi- nation of vessels - it was more important to construct the correct combination of jars, bottles, etc., than to receive many fine-line pieces. It remains for us to decipher the mean- ing of these combinations (fig. n). A peculiarity of fine-line bottles found in the San José de Moro tombs is that a high per- centage of the sample is missing their stirrup- spouts. The bottles were apparently muti- lated by violently removing the spouts before burial, an action that, because of its recur- rence, would seem to be ritual in nature. The missing spouts are not found within the tomb or in the associated fill among discarded arti- facts. In Tomb M-U509, for example, we found an extreme case of mutilation. A fine- line stirrup-spout bottle, exquisitely painted, was missing not only the spout, but also the upper half of the body. The act of breaking the spout also broke the body of the bottle. Neither the spout, nor any missing piece of the body, was found within the funeral cham- ber or the surroundings. Mutilations of this type have not been reported in the southern Moche area or for the Early or Middle periods of the northern Moche region, although other shared modalities of mutilation exist in these earlier periods, such as the smashing of un- fired effigy vessels at Huaca de la Luna (Bour- get, this volume,- Uceda et al. 1994: 296). Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that mutilations of fine ceramics are frequent in contexts associated with the Wari tradition (see for example Isbell and McEwan 1991). If many similarities exist between fine- . line ceramics of San José de Moro and their counterparts in the southern Moche region, we also find specific differences due to the adaptation of the southern style by northern artists. Four differences are important in the iconographie sphere: ( 1 ) the reduction in num- ber of iconographie themes (Shimada 1994: 227-246); (2) the new emphasis on themes with a maritime character (McClelland 1990); (3) the high frequency of representations of castillo 319</page><page sequence="15">the Priestess or Supernatural Woman (Hoc- quenghem and Lyon 1980; Holmquist 1992); and (4) the almost complete disappearance of human beings from the iconographie registry. Only a small fraction of the wide repertoire of themes that appear in Moche IV iconogra- phy of the southern region appear in the Late Moche fine-line style of the northern region. Notable is the absence of scenes of runners, human combat, deer or sea lion hunts, dances, the consumption of coca, or the dance of the dead. Other themes showing shamans or women giving birth, known in modeled ceramics, are also absent. Some themes ap- pear only as partial depictions. Such was the case of the anthropomorphized war club from the Sacrifice scene, represented on the cup of the Priestess from San José de Moro (fig. 7) and on a fragment of a bowl excavated at Pampa Grande (Shimada 1994: fig. 2.10). Scenes represented in Late Moche fine-line are few and repetitive: the Burial Theme, the combat between supernatural beings, the navigation of the reed rafts, the Priestess on a crescent moon, and the anthropomorphized wave. Beings who combine a human appear- ance with features of marine creatures (fish or shell) or feline canine teeth are frequently represented. McClelland (1990) has docu- mented a new emphasis on maritime themes in Late Moche. These themes are antecedents to the priorities in Chimú and Lambayeque iconography, where representations of reed rafts, fishermen, marine birds, and anthropo- morphic waves are noted (Pillsbury 1993). The Priestess, also known as the Supernat- ural Woman (Hocquenghem and Lyon 1980; Holmquist 1992), is the most common per- sonage of Late period iconography. This popu- larity derives from the high frequency of repre- sentations where she appears, principally the burial and the navigation of the reed rafts scenes, as well as a simplified version of the Priestess on a crescent moon scene. It is inter- esting to note that the increase in the depic- tion of women coincides with the occurrence of elite tombs for females. It would seem the iconography reflects an increase in the rela- tive importance of women in Moche society (see also Cordy-Collins, this volume). Two other popular personages are the Aia Paec fig- ure (Larco 1945), also called the Wrinkle Face by Donnan (1978) or Anthropomorphic Per- sonage of the Serpents7 Belts (Castillo 1989), and the anthropomorphized iguana. Both are represented in three oft-represented scenes: burial, mythic combat, and the game with sticks and beans that Larco called the Scene of the Decoders (1944). Finally, perhaps the most peculiar feature of Late Moche iconography is the almost complete disappearance of human beings as principal elements in the representations. This is particularly clear at San José de Moro, where human beings appear only as second- ary figures in the Burial Theme. The lack of human beings is even more interesting when we consider the close association between the governing Moche elite and the personages that are represented in Late Moche iconogra- phy. If Late Moche society, as we have come to believe, was strongly threatened by ex- ternal climatic instability and threats from expansionistic societies and internal (the social contradictions generated by the politi- cal elite) forces, then art would have fulfilled the function of legitimating the prevailing social system. Translating the iconographie content of southern Moche art to the ap- parently less diverse northern society pro- duces a thematic selection prioritizing those iconographie programs that favor the govern- ing elite. The iconography turns into a sort of family album, where rulers and their courts are represented in rituals reserved for them. Other segments of society would have been excluded from these representations, and any modification in the iconographie repertoire would have been controlled through attached specialists overseeing the production of arti- facts with elaborate iconographie content. In other words, the lower levels of society would have been excluded from appearing on, or possessing, this type of artifact. Thus, the iconographie style of fine-line would have been closely associated with the Moche elite and its exercise of power. The Beginning of the End The decline of Moche society at San José de Moro is marked archaeologically by changes in funerary patterns and ceramic styles, par- ticularly the disappearance of fine-line ce- ramics. These changes are symptomatic of the effects of external pressures and grave inter- nal crisis in the society. We have uncovered more evidence of interaction with Middle 32O CASTILLO</page><page sequence="16">Horizon societies of the central coast at San José de Moro than in almost any other site of the north coast. Nonetheless, it is essential to examine carefully the context in which these artifacts appear. It is also important to identi- fy at what moment the stylistic changes in the occupational sequence, which reflect interaction with other societies, begin to occur. For example, the first evidence of Wari or Wari-derived ceramics appears in the Late Moche period, not after the collapse, and is limited to the most complex burials. Not sur- prisingly, the local copies of Wari pieces are also produced in the Late Moche period, and not later. This is contrary to earlier assump- tions about Wari on the north coast, which held that this interaction came after the fall of Moche. I will first analyze the form these external influences take. We never found a foreign tomb at San José de Moro, still less a Wari tomb. The external influences, however numerous in the Late and Transitional periods, did not lead to an annexation by an outside state or even dem- onstrate the presence of individuals repre- senting a foreign political entity at San José de Moro. There is no tomb where the majority of artifacts are of foreign origin. We found imported artifacts, local copies of them, and artifacts locally produced in a hybrid style; but these objects represent a small percentage of the total ceramic assemblage and appear only in very complex tombs, tombs still fol- lowing the standard Moche funerary pattern. This does not imply, however, that these arti- 12. Wari style ceramics from San José de Moro Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra facts did not have an important effect on the development of local styles. If we analyze the evolution of complex ceramic styles at San José de Moro, particu- larly in ceramics with elaborate iconography, we can distinguish three phases during the Late Moche period: First Phase: There is no Wari or Wari- derived influence. The most elaborate style was that found on the canonical Late Moche fine-line ceramics. No Wari ceramics have been found from this period at the site of Pampa Grande, either. Second Phase: The first pieces of imported ceramics appear and new styles derived from external influences flourish. This phase can perhaps be subdivided into two stages: i) the moment the first imported ceramics arrive and are incorporated into Late Moche elite tombs,- and 2) the subsequent production of hybrid styles and local copies of foreign, particularly Wari-related ceramics. The tomb of the Priestess (M-U41), excavated in 199 1 (Donnan and Castillo 1994), pertains to the first stage, as we found only imported Niev- eria and Cajamarca artifacts associated with fine-line Moche ceramics. Third Phase: Fine-line ceramics disappear, but copies of foreign, Wari-related ceramics continue, reinforcing hybrid styles that com- bine features of Moche iconography with the forms, colors, and designs of non-Moche types. This phase overlaps with the Tran- sitional period. Of these three phases, the most complex is the second, as it shows the greatest number of interacting cultural vectors. In this phase, the first versions of Moche polychrome ceramics are produced and the hybrid ceramic style is perfected. In order to understand the evolu- tion of fine-line during this turbulent period of Late Moche, we may evaluate indepen- dently three formal aspects, vessel form, col- ors, and iconographie motifs, and contrast local sources with external influences. Vessel forms: the two principal shapes employed are typically Moche stirrup-spout bottles and double-spout-and-bridge bottles, a shape of clearly southern origin. Occasionally the fine-line style, bichrome as well as poly- chrome, is found on simpler forms like jars, cups, or flattened jars. Color: two color schemes are used to deco- rate the ceramics. One, red-ochre-over-cream, castillo 321</page><page sequence="17">13- Stirrup-spout vessel with Wari polychrome design Rodriguez Razetto collection Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra 14.

The second, a polychrome style, is characteristic of the southern tradition. Iconographie motifs: these range from canonical Moche narrative scenes, such as the Burial Theme or the Priestess on the raft, to geometric and stylized motifs indicating significant influence from the Wari tradition (fig. 12). We see two extremes in the fine-line speci- mens: at one end there are pieces entirely Moche in style, represented by the stirrup- spout form, the bichrome decoration, and the classic motifs of its iconography; at the other extreme, there are pieces with clear Wari influence, represented by polychrome double- spout-and-bridge bottles with geometric designs (see Castillo and Donnan 1994b: 112). Between these two extremes, we find a great quantity of artifacts mixing these three vari- ables. If we exclude ceramics that are ex- clusively Moche or imported, the combi- nation of variables gives us six theoretical possibilities, of which we find examples of only four: (1) ceramics that combine Moche form and iconography with foreign poly- chrome (for example, the Museo Amano piece illustrated by Shimada 1994: fig. 9.1); (2) 322 CASTILLO ceramics that combine foreign form and poly- chrome with Moche iconography (Larco 1966a: fig. 108-109; Rowe 1942); (3) ceramics that combine Moche form with foreign iconography and polychrome (fig. 13); and (4) ceramics of foreign form with Moche bi- chrome and iconography. The unique example of this combination is a double-spout-and- bridge vessel found in the Late Moche boot- shaped tomb M-U134 at San José de Moro, with representations of Aia Paec (Wrinkle Face) tied to a bird of prey and an anthropo- morphized iguana (fig. 14). 8 We know of no examples for the two re- maining combinations, that is, stirrup-spout or double-spout-and-bridge vessels with bi- chrome foreign designs. It is possible that the foreign motifs are closely tied to polychromy. Moche iconographie motifs, by contrast, tend to appear in both bichrome and polychrome schemes. Another important marker distinguishing the collapse of Moche society in the Jequete- peque Valley is the variation in tomb type. During the Late Moche period, the most com- mon type was the boot-shaped tomb, which continued to be used even as influence of for- eign ceramic styles becomes more noticeable.</page><page sequence="18">1 5 . View of Late Moche Tomb M-U623 Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra Nonetheless, the boot-shaped tomb falls into disuse at the same time fine-line ceramics disappear. The pit tomb replaces the boot- shape tomb in the Transitional period, although burial position remains the same: the individual is oriented with feet to the north, head to the south, and in an extended dorsal position. The disappearance of boot- shaped tombs at the end of Moche marks the end of a tradition that had existed since the Middle Moche period, and perhaps earlier, and was associated with the middle and upper segments of Moche society. Its replacement by pit tombs in the Transitional period signi- fies the imposition of a type that was more popular with the lower levels of society. Before disappearing, however, the Late Moche boot-shaped tombs began to show cer- tain variations on the norm, particularly in terms of the orientation of the body (fig. 15).9 The orientation of the body becomes erratic, with no standard pattern. Many of the tombs contain multiple burials. New types of ceramics, created using new techniques and decoration, also appear in the tombs. Cri- soles, which were earlier quite simple in form, now have faces modeled on the vessel bodies. These two concurrent changes, the disap- pearance of bichrome fine-line ceramics, as well as the polychrome variant on double- spout-and-bridge bottles; and the disappear- ance of boot-shaped tombs, definitively and permanently mark the end of Moche. During the subsequent period, we have documented some remnants and archaisms, including re- used Late Moche vessels, but generally, the production of this type of ceramics ceases and the technology involved in the manufacture is lost. This cessation of fine-line ceramics and boot-shaped tombs has important implica- tions for understanding what happened at the end of Moche society. Boot-shaped tombs, as well as fine-line ceramics, had been restricted to the Moche elite: only elite members of Moche society were interred in such elabo- rate tombs and utilized such fineware. Thus, the end of Moche could be defined by the dis- appearance of forms that would have marked certain class differences. It is possible that the Moche decline is, in reality, only an elite "collapse," with the elite disappearing or amalgamating with previously socially in- ferior segments of society. If true, this hy- pothesis would reinforce the idea that the castillo 323</page><page sequence="19">Moche collapse is eminently a process of in- ternal crisis and reconstitution of social power (Bawden 1995, 1996; Castillo and Donnan 1994a; DeMarais, Castillo, and Earle 1995). In order to understand the Wari impact on Moche society, it is useful to analyze what was occurring within both societies. From the Moche perspective, it seems that at the beginning of the Middle Horizon period, Wari or Wari-derived ceramics begin to be im- ported from Wari-related societies on the coast, such as Nieveria, Pachacamac, and Atareo. In this era, Wari culture was most likely conceived as successful, expanding, and the bearer of a refined iconography which symbolized its ideology and religion (Menzel 1964, 1977; Schreiber 1992). The Moche elite would have considered it advantageous to use elements of this new ideology and iconogra- phy as part of their own strategies of political control, perhaps to show some degree of com- munication with the Wari elite. The impor- tation of such exotic ceramics to the Moche region signals an opening up of barriers. The Moche, up until this time, had been relatively impermeable to foreign influence and it was rare to find any imported artifacts before this era. After this opening, however, there is a new status object to mark differential access for the upper level of elites. Thus, only the most complex tombs contain imported ceramics. Such a diversified and complex Wari pres- ence on the north coast has only been reported for San José de Moro (Castillo and Donnan 1994a, 1994b). To date, the available evidence affirms that this occurs within a Moche cultural matrix, with some elite per- sons importing and including foreign ce- ramics in their tombs. There is no evidence of any form of coercion. Previously, the pres- ence of Wari artifacts was evaluated without knowledge of their original contexts or the understanding of their relative scarcity; this, in turn led to speculation that the north coast was under the imperial dominance of Wari society (Menzel 1977; Schreiber 1992). Late Moche style artifacts have been reported in sites from Piura (Larco 1966a) to Lima (Stumer 1958) without anyone suggesting that Moche society had conquered the terri- tory between these two extremes. What was beneficial about importing arti- facts from another culture? And why pre- cisely Wari? Responding to these questions obliges us to make a detailed account of what we presume occurred in the last years of the Moche in the Jequetepeque Valley. Through- out their history, the Moche had developed forms of social control strongly based on ide- ological content and the management of its manifestations (DeMarais, Castillo, and Earle 1995). This emphasis tended to minimize dissension and increase consensus, which directly affected productivity, social soli- darity, and the legitimacy of rulers. The Moche elite would have carried this strategy to its limits, positioning themselves so that they would be conceived of as living deities or their incarnation (Donnan and Castillo 1994). We recall that in this era human beings dis- appear almost completely from the icono- graphie registry, and all scenes center on actions of the gods. In other words, the elite no longer would have required mediation in their interactions with the gods; the rulers would have assumed their role directly. This strategy is convenient when all is going well, but in a crisis, it leaves no room to blame an intermediary. The grave climatic fluctuations that characterized the early half of the Late Moche period (Shimada et al. 1 99 1 ) would have weakened the elite, as they could not impede destruction, yet they still assumed the role of living gods. Debilitated, rulers would need ways to reproduce their sources of power. Previously, they had employed a combination of political management with ideological legitimacy; this time, however, they tried to reinforce this strategy by introducing elements from another prestigious ideological system. For this reason, they establish the first Wari con- tacts, perhaps indirectly through intermediary societies, and thus the first imported ceramic style, Nieveria, appears in the Jequetepeque Valley, while exported Moche ceramics ap- pear in the Nieveria cemetery in the Rimac Valley (Stumer 1958). Access and communication routes with Middle Horizon societies of the central coast were not located along the coast, but rather connected to the Jequetepeque Valley through Cajamarca in the adjacent highlands, where the Wari presence was stronger (Topic 1 99 1 ). This can be inferred from the absence of intermediate sites with San José de Moro associations in southern Moche territory. 324 CASTILLO</page><page sequence="20">Furthermore, the appearance of imported Wari style ceramics coincides with the ap- pearance of the first examples of Cajamarca style ceramics. The Moche elite, and only the upper seg- ment, would have monopolized these im- ported materials, thus altering one of the basic norms of their social system: the redis- tribution of sumptuary goods among the mid- dle and lower levels of the same class. More damaging, the governing elite would, for the first time, have been restricted in redistribut- ing these goods, as the prestigious Wari arti- facts were not produced by them. Bawden sees this damage to traditional reciprocity models as one of the most important causes of internal crisis in Moche society (Bawden 1995, 1996). Faced with the impossibility of satisfying obligations owed to their subordinates, and pressured by strong demand, it would have been necessary to fabricate locally pieces that imitated the forms, iconographie motifs, and polychrome of artifacts that earlier had only been imported. To satisfy this demand, a polychrome style was developed. Hence, shortly after importing the first Wari pieces, the Moche elite would have developed new imitations of artifact types and maintained their network of reciprocity with other seg- ments of their class. One would have to sur- mise that the polychrome pieces, as had oc- curred before with fine-line and stirrup-spout ceramics in the Middle Moche period, ap- peared in tombs in very limited quantities. If the importation and use of Wari artifacts by the upper-level elites reflects an accep- tance of certain ideological ideas sponsored by the Wari, an affiliation with this society, and the beginning of a cultural and ideologi- cal opening, then the extension of the use of these artifacts to the lower levels of society, via imitation artifacts, implies that Wari ide- ology and influence on Late Moche society is now widespread. The ideological implications of these facts are complex. The new ideas and the appear- ance of polychrome ceramic styles coincide in the archaeological record with an overall stylistic opening of the Late Moche period. New forms appear, and there is a significant reduction in Moche ceramic types. Moche style and culture deteriorate slowly, but constantly. It should not surprise us that the Moche generated a polychrome style based on the Wari tradition. The archaeological record demonstrates that hybrid styles are common in areas where Wari once interacted with local societies. This happened in the lea Val- ley of the south coast with the development of the Atareo style, which combines a Nasca base with Wari influence. It had also occurred in the central coast, where the Lima style gave rise to the Nieveria and Pachacamac styles from clear Wari influence. Lamentably, the relationship between Wari and these so- cieties is not clear, nor is its strategy of expan- sion, influence, and territorial control. In view of this transformation process, it is critical to define at what moment Moche cul- ture ceases and why. These questions have no easy answers. I indicated earlier two indices that allow us to define the end of the Moche at San José de Moro: the disappearance of fine- line ceramics and boot-shaped tombs. Never- theless, at the level of ceramic styles, rela- tively few disappear. Forms and styles typical of mid-grade ceramics during the Middle Moche period are still produced. A few poly- chrome vessels are still being included in the tombs, and while the quantity of imported ce- ramics is small, its variety is great. Ceramics of the Viñaque, Pachacamac, and Casma styles are found. At the end of this process, the only ele- ments that disappear are those most directly associated with the elite. The tombs they uti- lize disappear, while the most simple tomb form, the pit tomb, predominates. Fine-line iconography disappears, and with it, a com- plex religious iconography that will never reappear on the north coast. This implies that the elite and their gods, the principal subjects of the representation, disappear from the iconographie repertoire. Geometric motifs, small and generalized anthropomorphic depictions, and simplified animals replace them: these are all motifs that come to popu- late the art and iconography of the subse- quent Lambayeque and Chimú cultures. We can infer, beginning with these transforma- tions, that the predominant authority had changed - that the elite had lost control and were banished, at least from iconographie space. This would signal an internal deterio- ration that might have had an element of vio- lence, as in this era defensive constructions, castillo 325</page><page sequence="21">walled cities, and hilltop fortifications multi- ply - all indications of instability reaching violent levels and requiring action (Dillehay, this volume). Where were the forces of the state in the face of these threats? This all sug- gests that the principals affected by this crisis were precisely the state and its directors; the elite could not have impeded the spread of violence when they were not capable of de- fending themselves. Nevertheless, there is also evidence to support the idea that this deterioration was not abrupt; rather, it oc- curred over a long period of time, perhaps over an entire generation, and culminated with the weakening of the elite, rather than their overthrow. Epilogue: The Transitional Period The period after Moche has been given vari- ous names in different regions: Larco called it Huari Norteño (1966b); in the Trujillo area, it is designated Early Chimú (Donnan and Maclcey 1978); and further north, it is called Early Lambayeque (also Sicán) (Shimada 1994). As with all intermediate periods, this phase is difficult to define. Generally, it has been easier to consider the evidence from societies located on the extremes, which are then defined as a manifestation of the transition. The archaeology of the Jequetepeque Valley has been no exception, and therefore we did not hope to find clear evidence for a period immediately after the Moche. In the first years of investigation at San José de Moro, we located some pit tombs that contained a mixture of materials related to Moche, but with some Lambayeque ele- ments. Plates with white slip and geometric designs of a style known as Cajamarca Costeña (Disselhoff 1958a) were found associ- ated with these ceramics. For this reason, we assigned these tombs to a period we called Lambayeque-Cajamarca. As the sample for this period increased, we realized that we were not dealing with the Lambayeque period and that relationships with Cajamarca were distant. The assemblage seemed to be a combination of many of the ceramic forms of the mid-grade and domestic types seen in Late Moche with some forms derived from foreign styles. Flasks, face-neck jars and double-chambered vessels are abundant (fig. 16). 16.

In the last two years of investigation, the sample of these tombs has increased, and it has been possible to associ- ate them with a series of adobe brick align- ments and paicas, suggesting that the ritual funerary complexes characteristic of the Mid- dle and Late Moche continued. What we at first expected to be a short-term transition period, became a full occupation period, which, in the absence of radiocarbon dates, we are presuming extended from a.d. 800 to 950. This period marked the end of Moche influences and a synthesis of traits from Mid- dle Horizon societies of the central coast. Given these characteristics, we are calling it in the Transitional period. Ceramic styles that developed during the Late Moche period persisted into the Tran- sitional period. It would seem that the same artisans who fabricated ceramics with great stylistic freedom in Late Moche continued producing them; only the workshops that made fine-line ceramics disappeared. Some new styles that seem to originate from the Casma region, particularly oxidized ceramics (blackware) with relief designs, were associ- ated with older styles. The disappearance of the Moche elite does not mean that the Transitional period lacked leadership. In 1998 we identified two super- posed chamber tombs, representing at least two phases within the Transitional period associated with elite individuals. The upper chamber contained a great quantity of high- quality Cajamarca Costeña ceramics and Transitional period ceramics. The lower chamber contained more than thirty indi- viduals and over one hundred and fifty ves- sels, copper masks, metal ornaments, Spon- dylus beads, mother-of-pearl, and camelid bones. The bodies were placed in an extended position, oriented north to south, as they were in the Moche era. This chamber was apparently open during a prolonged period of time, and as more individuals were intro- duced, the earlier bodies, already disarticu- lated, were pushed to the sides, as were their offerings. Funerary chambers with so many 17. Imported ceramic vessel, Transitional period Rodriguez Razetto collection Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra individuals have not been reported for the Late Moche period, although Ubbelohde- Doering excavated a Middle Moche boot- shaped tomb (EI) with more than ten indi- viduals at Pacatnamú (1967, 1983). The change in governing elite during the Transitional period, however, does not signify a decrease in the proliferation of ceramic styles or the production of imitated styles. On the contrary, we continue to find some imported vessels (fig. 17), including Viñaque, Pachacamac, Cajamarca, and Casma press- molded ware and locally produced copies of these styles. As in the Late Moche period, a small number of imported ceramic vessels appear in elite tombs, and they are sur- rounded by local variants, indicating a con- tinued restriction of production and distribu- tion of imported artifacts. This combination of styles also suggests that the individuals buried in these tombs were of local origin. The Transitional period ends abruptly around 950 a.D., when the Jequetepeque Val- ley was conquered by the expansionist Lambayeque state. At that moment, the plethora of ceramic styles characteristic of the Transitional period disappears, and the castillo 327</page><page sequence="23">1 8. Lambayeque ceramics in Tomb M-U501 Now in the Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo Photograph by Juan Pablo Murrugarra Middle Lambayeque style emerged. This style, largely associated with blackware, is represented at San José de Moro by low bowls with annular ring bases, and jars with relief decoration in the upper half of the body (fig. 18). A figure known as the Huaco Rey domi- nates the iconography. The pit form of tomb construction continues, but individuals are buried in a seated position and frequently associated with large concentrations of chalk. The Lambayeque state eliminated the stylis- tic liberalism that characterized the Tran- sitional period; the region was once again under centralized control. With the Lambay- eque conquest, followed by the subsequent Chimú and Inca conquests, the independence of the Jequetepeque Valley was finished for- ever, and the region became subject to states centered elsewhere. Converted to a marginal province, Jequetepeque lost its vitality, as reflected in an increasingly diminished cul- tural production. NOTES Work at San José de Moro has been possible thanks to the generous support of the local inhabitants, particularly from Richard and Julio Ibarrola, as well as Dr. Lorenzo Sánchez Cabanillas and Mrs. Miriam Valle de Baltuano, the mayors of Chepén and Pacanga respectively, and the students who diligently partici- pated in the Project over the years. The investigations were given financial support by many institutions and individuals. In particular, I wish to thank: The Bruno Foundation of Fresno, California; the John B. Heinz Charitable Trust; the University of California, Los Angeles, Academic Senate,- the Fowler Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles; the Dirección Académica de Investigación, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú; the Banco de Crédito del Perú; Luz del Sur; Boyles Bros. Diamantina S.A., among others. There has been significant editorial collaboration in preparing this text with many of my colleagues and students, whose critiques and suggestions have shaped my ideas on the Moche. I wish to thank especially Christopher Donnan, Carol Mackey, Alana Cordy-Collins, Andrew Nelson, Guillermo Cock, Santiago Uceda, Ulla Holmquist, Krysztof Makowski, Garth Bawden, Julio Rucabado, Flora Ugaz, Gabriela Freyre, Patricia Pérez-Albela, Alexia Brazzini, Cecilia Pardo, and Monica Nobl. Many of the ideas arose from having taught a course on the Moche. To the students of this course, for their critiques and suggestions, I extend my thanks. Any errors are due to my stubbornness. 328 CASTILLO</page><page sequence="24">i . Investigation at San José de Moro has occurred in three phases. Between 1991 and 1993, the project was directed by Christopher Donnan and Luis Jaime Castillo (Castillo and Donnan 1994a). During this phase, the excavations centered on the Huaca de la Capilla zone and resulted in the discovery of numer- ous Lambayeque and Late Moche tombs. Among them were five chamber tombs, two of which per- tained to the Priestesses of Moro. Between 1995 and 1997, the project was directed by Carol Mackey, Andrew Nelson, and Luis Jaime Castillo (Castillo, Mackey, and Nelson 1996, 1997, 1998). During this phase, the investigations continued, primarily in the soccer field zone and at the Chimú provincial administrative site of Algarrobál de Moro. Since 1997, research directed by the author has concen- trated on the excavation of funerary zones and study of the ceremonial areas associated with the burials. In addition, other sites in the region have been examined, particularly those in the Chamán Valley. 2. In the Jequetepeque Valley, the most important Late Moche sites are not found in this zone,- how- ever, we can see that tension still existed, given the tendency for walled sites to be constructed near the mountains. Such sites would have served as a defense from an aggressor, both internal and external. 3 . The three large boot tombs found by Ubbelohde- Doering at Pacatnamú (EI, MXI, and MXII) have not been properly studied to date. These and two other tombs were only partially published by Ubbelohde- Doering (1967, 1983), and by Giesela and Wolfgang Heclcer (1983), based on the reexamination of the original 1938 notes and photographs. There is no agreement yet as to which phase these tombs corre- spond to. We believe that Tomb EI corresponds to the Middle Moche phase, based on similarities with tombs of San José de Moro from this period. Tomb MXI is incomplete due to looting in antiquity, but would seem to be integrally Late Moche, again based on the similarities with San José de Moro tombs. Finally, Tomb MXII, the most complicated of the three, seems to have had two occupations: (1) one multiple occupation of the Middle Moche period; and (2) a Late Moche period reoccupation in which an individual was inserted into the eastern side of the funerary chamber, with the first occupants and their associated materials pushed to the sides. The individual who reoccupied Tomb MXII seems to have been important, as his grave goods included elaborate earrings and a rattle scepter, as well as metal pieces in the shapes of arms and legs (Donnan and Castillo 1994). 4. Ceramics found in association with the royal tombs of Sipán pertaining to the Middle period were surprising in their formal and decorative simplicity. The tomb of the Old Lord of Sipán included a signifi- cant number of face-neck jars, crudely decorated with animal forms and human beings on the vessel bodies (Alva 1994: figs. 160, 199, 333, 334). The Lord of Sipán tomb included an enormous quantity of ceramics in a lateral repository (Alva 1994: figs. 26, 283-296) and in the interior of the same funerary chamber (Alva 1994: figs. 129, 134, 135, 140, 297-308), but again, these ceramics were very simple in style and form. 5. Shimada (1994) suggests that one of the important changes in funerary customs of Late Moche is a shift in the standard burial practice from an extended supine position to either a tightly flexed or an extended, on-the-side, burial position. This affir- mation is based on examples reported at the El Brujo complex and a burial excavated by Disselhoff ( 1 941 ) at Huaca Lucia at Batán Grande. At San José de Moro and Pacatnamú, however, the extended-position burials continued until the Lambayeque conquest. Shimada further suggests that this change in position coincides with other changes, such as the appearance of ceramics with symmetrically placed shoulder lug handles and press-molded decorations. Nevertheless, these forms appear earlier in the Middle Moche ceramics at Pacatnamú and San José de Moro (Ubbelohde-Doering 1983: figs. 17.2, 17.5, 20.7, 21.3). 6. Three pieces (fig. 10, a-c) with this decoration come from the Mazanca excavations, from contexts which date to the transition between the Virú and Moche periods (Donnan, Navarro, and Cordy-Collins 1997: 26, 49). Ubbelohde-Doering (1983: fig. 19.3) published a vessel (fig. 10, d) similar to that found in Tomb E i (fig. 10, e), pertaining to the Middle Moche period at Pacatnamú. For the Late Moche period, we have two examples: one from the tomb of a child at San José de Moro (fig. 10, f; Makowski et al. 1994: 324; fig. 358), and one reported by Shimada at Pampa Grande (fig. 10, g; Shimada and Maguiña 1994: fig. 1. 1 7). Finally, at San José de Moro, we found an example of this peculiar form in a Transitional period burial (fig. 10, h; Rucabado 1999). 7. An important characteristic in Late Moche funer- ary customs of the Jequetepeque Valley is the signifi- cant quantities of mid-grade and domestic ceramics within the tombs. The elite tombs can have between twenty to thirty pieces, among which are jars of various sizes, many stained with soot, simple bowls, and other forms. The inclusion of simple ceramics in late tombs is fortunate for chronological analysis, as it relates the most diagnostic forms, such as stirrup- spout bottles, to less time-sensitive forms such as jars. 8. In same tomb mentioned above with the architec- tural models, two polychrome jars with rounded- point bases were found (see Donnan 1973: pl. 7, A-D, for similar examples). 9. At San José de Moro, Tomb M-U623 is a good example of what occurs at the end of the Moche period. Burials are oriented east-west, and contain two individuals on their sides, one in front of the other, and associated with polychrome ceramics, albeit fewer in number. Very little within the tomb appears to be Moche, except a face-neck jar, two flasks, and the boot-tomb shape itself. CASTILLO 329</page><page sequence="25">BIBLIOGRAPHY Alva, Walter 1994 Sipán.
