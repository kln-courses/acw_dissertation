<plain_text><page sequence="1">28 PAST AND PRESENT The Outbreak of the French Revolution ALTHOUGH THERE IS A TENDENCY TO RE-OPEN THE DEBATE ON THE causes of the French Revolution, most reputable historians of the event have by now accepted the thesis that the Revolution was the product of a conflict of social classes rather than the outcome of a conspiracy hatched by philosophes, lawyers, disgruntled officials or Freemasons. Since the publication of Jaures' Histoire Socialiste at the turn of the century, a serious effort has been made, as well, by a number of historians to treat the problems, aspirations and movements of the peasant and urban masses in their own right instead of as an echo or reflection of the speeches and actions of the revolutionary leaders in Paris. Such studies have, of course, done more than merely throw a fresh light on the general causes and course of the Revolution; they have made it possible to measure with greater accuracy the point of revolutionary outbreak and the part played by the masses of town and countryside in relation to it. The revolutionary explosion, therefore, no longer appears as a more or less fortuitous climax to a series of purely political, though interrelated, crises --the rejection of Calonne's proposals by the Notables, the convocation of the States General, the dismissal of Necker, etc. - but as the sharp collision of a complex of social forces at a moment of acute revolutionary crisis. Even when this is accepted, however, the picture may still become lop-sided if one or other of the social forces, whose coming together - either in alliance or in opposition - provoked the revolutionary crisis, is not seen in its proper perspective. The most familiar distortion of this kind is that which presents the revolutionary action of the peasant and urban masses as " waiting upon " that of the bourgeoisie, or even of the privileged orders themselves. Mathiez, in particular, has made us familiar with the picture of the origins of the great Revolution as a gradual " unfolding "of minor revolutions - first the " rdvolte nobiliaire "; then the "revolution bourgeoise"; and, finally, the popular revolution. While such a presentation is convenient and has more than a grain of truth in it, it tends to reduce the intervention of the masses to one of secondary importance and fails to show that the popular movement, while intensified and</page><page sequence="2">THE OUTBREAK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 29 accelerated by the revolutionary crisis, had its origins in the Old Regime and, in fact, preceded by many years the revolutionary activity of the bourgeoisie. On the other hand, writers like Daniel Guerin have gone to the opposite extreme by exaggerating the independence and the degree of coherence and political maturity of the popular movement, and particularly emphasizing those aspects of it which appear to look forward to the working class movements of the 19th and 20oth centuries.2 In the view of such historians, of course, it is not the wage-earners or sans-culottes,3 but the bourgeoisie itself which ceases to be a revolutionary force. Yet another tendency has been to present the revolutionary crisis almost exclusively in terms of more or less short-term economic factors, particularly of rising or falling prices. No-one will deny the great contribution made to our knowledge of the origins of the Revolution by Ernest Labrousse: before his work appeared,4 little was known of the movements of prices and wages in 18th century France, particularly in the crucial years preceding the revolutionary outbreak. Labrousse's insistence, however, on the primacy of " natural " (i.e. uncontrollable economic) over " anthropomorphic" causes has the effect of reducing the popular movement to the automatic product of purely economic factors.5 The present study introduces new material to illustrate the range and diversity of the movement in town and countryside - particularly in the Paris region - in the years leading up to the Revolution; it also attempts to place the revolt of the privileged orders and the Parlements (the " r6volte nobiliaire ") and the revolutionary action of the bourgeoisie in the crisis of 1788-9 in their correct historical setting; but, above all, it is concerned to trace the main stages and currents of the popular movement during the last years of the Old Regime up to the point where its " merger" with that of the bourgeoisie touched off the revolutionary explosion. Let us begin with the year 1775. There had, of course, been numerous other movements provoked by hunger and the high cost of bread in earlier periods of the century - as, for example, in 1725, 1739-40, 1752 and 1768;6 but that of 1775 is not only the nearest to the point of revolutionary outbreak, but the most extensive, the best documented and that which bears the closest resemblance to the popular movements of the Revolution itself. Turgot had been appointed Comptroller-General in August 1774. He started with no particular record of unpopularity as far as the common people were concerned: at any rate, his predecessor and most vocal opponent,</page><page sequence="3">30 PAST AND PRESENT the Abb6 Terray, was, soon after his appointment, burned in effigy in the Faubourg St. Antoine.7 Yet, to the delight of his enemies at Court, he was soon to lose any semblance of popular favour by his over-haste in applying Physiocratic doctrine to the grain-trade: an arrit of 13 September restored freedom of trade in grain and flour. This, combined with a bad harvest, led to a shortage and a rapid rise in the price of corn, flour and bread in the following spring and summer. The price of the 4-lb. loaf in Paris (normally 8-9 sous, though, in recent years, more often Io-II sous) rose to II4 sous in early March and to 131 sous at the end of April: Grain riots had already broken out in Dijon, Tours, Metz, Rheims and Montauban - and, in their wake, sprang up that particular series of riots, centred in Paris and its adjoining provinces, known to history as " la guerre des farines." The movement spread from market to market and took the form of a popular price-control of wheat, flour and bread - the price of bread being generally fixed at 2 sous per pound, that of flour at 2o sous a bushel and wheat at 12 francs a setier (2 quintals). Starting on 27 April at Beaumont-sur-Oise, twenty miles north of Paris, it reached Pontoise on the 29th, St. Germain on I May, Versailles on the 2nd and Paris itself on the 3rd. It then spread eastwards and southwards up the valleys of the Seine and Marne, lingered for several days in the markets and villages of Brie, reached Beaumont-sur-GAtinais (50 miles south of Paris) on the 9th, and petered out somewhere near Melun on the ioth. It is instructive to note the main features of this remarkable movement. It was essentially a spontaneous movement - in spite of some historians' claim to the contrary - provoked by hunger and the fear of shortage. It saw the massive invasion of markets and farms by urban poor, farm-labourers, village artisans, and even occasional farmers and well-to-do bourgeois. It was directed, in the main, against farmers or prosperous peasants (laboureurs), grain-merchants, millers and bakers; and aroused some sympathy among other classes - certain priests, for example, either encouraged, or did little to restrain, their parishioners from taking part in the movement, and more than one market official helped it along by himself fixing a " just " price for grain or flour. Why, then, did a movement of such magnitude and bearing striking similarities with certain movements of the Revolution yield no tangible result ? In the first place, the food crisis itself, though protracted, was overcome by the end of the summer: prices began to fall in October. Secondly, Turgot managed to crush the movement by a combination of propaganda - via the Bishops - and the use</page><page sequence="4">THE OUTBREAK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 31 of troops, who remained entirely loyal to the Government. More important still, the bulk of the peasantry was not involved: the question of tithes, feudal dues or game laws did not arise. Lastly, and perhaps most important of all, the bourgeoisie had not yet begun to challenge the existing order and, in any case, were bound to be hostile to a movement directed against members of their own class and against a Minister, whose accession to office they had hailed with enthusiasm and whose reforms - including that of free trade in grain - they actively supported: in several towns, in fact, the milice bourgeoise was mustered in order to crush the riots." The main lesson of 1775 was, in short, that, in the conditions of 18th century France, no isolated movement of wage-earners, artisans and village poor could hope to yield revolutionary results. This truth was to be realized on more than one occasion both before and during the Revolution. The twelve years that followed (1775 to 1787) were, despite a general sharpening of the longer-term economic crisis,9 years of comparatively stable food prices and social peace. In Paris, at least, the price of bread remained remarkably steady: from the manuscript Journal of the Parisian bookseller S6bastien Hardy we learn that, whereas, in the period 1767-75, the price of the 4-lb. loaf rarely fell below i sous (and, for a few days in November 1768, actually reached 16 sous), in the later period, the normal price was 8 or 9 sous, and it only rose to Ioj or II sous for very brief spells in 1784.x' Popular movements during these years were scattered and sporadic, arising on a number of separate issues. In June 1778, bread riots took place in Toulouse and Grenoble; in both, rioters were fired on by troops.11 In 1784 and 1786, there were protest movements in Paris against the barri?res, or ring of customs posts, recently erected by the Farmers-General to tax livestock, meat, wine, firewood and other commodities entering the capital;11 and, also in 1786, Hardy noted protests against the cost of meat and firewood.13 In Paris, too, there appears to have been a resurgence of anti-clerical feeling among the people: Hardy recorded a number of incidents between 1783 and 178914 that are reminiscent of the hostility to Jesuits in the 1720's and to the Archbishop of Paris over the billets de confession in 1752.15 More remarkable perhaps is the number of strikes, involving the journeymen in a number of trades and, in the case of the Lyons silk-workers, assuming almost insurrectionary proportions. Jules Flammermont may be right in attributing these, in part at least, to the special penal measures in restraint of combination introduced</page><page sequence="5">32 PAST AND PRESENT in August 1776 and to the anger of the workers at the reversal of the decision to abolish the guilds ;16 but it is worth observing that, in I8th century France, a crop of strikes usually coincides, as here, with a period of comparatively stable prices. In 1776, a general strike broke out among Parisian bookbinders who were demanding a 14-hour day.17 In July 1785, there was a large-scale and successful strike of Paris building-workers against a wage-cut imposed by the employers; in March 1786, the carpenters were on strike again and, this time, Hardy reported " une espace de fermentation " among the journeymen of several trades.18 In January of the same year, the carriers and porters of the capital struck against the institution of a rival monopoly by Court favourites, and seven to eight hundred of them marched to Versailles to see the King." In Lyons, the strikes of the silk-weavers led to widespread rioting and bloodshed.20 Yet, with the exception of the movement in Lyons, which had its sequel in the domination by the maitres-ouvriers of the meetings called to draw up the cahiers de doldances for the silk industry in 1789, it is doubtful if these labour disputes gave any appreciable impetus to the widespread and varied popular movement that was to arise in the period of revolutionary crisis. The year 1787 saw the opening of the " rdvolte nobiliaire " which served as a curtain-raiser to the revolutionary crisis of 1788-9. In February, an empty exchequer and mounting deficit forced the Government to convene the Assembly of Notables. Calonne, as Comptroller-General, proposed a number of stop-gap measures to meet the crisis, including a stamp-duty and a tax on landed estates. The privileged orders refused to co-operate. Calonne was dismissed on 8 April and succeeded by Lom6nie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse. Brienne's proposals being no more acceptable than Calonne's, the Notables in turn were dismissed on 25 May, and the " revolte nobiliaire " began. The opening shot was fired, as so often in the past, by the Paris Parlement which, while accepting Brienne's plan to relax controls on the sale and export of grain and protesting against the stamp-duty, refused absolutely to register the decree on the land-tax and demanded that the States General be convened to deal with the matter. When the decrees were, none the less, promulgated in a lit de justice in August, the provincial Parlements rallied to the support of Paris, and Brienne was forced to capitulate; the decrees on the land-tax and stamp-duty were withdrawn on 21 September and the Paris Parlement was reinstated a few days later.21 The return of the Paris Parlement from exile was the occasion of</page><page sequence="6">THE OUTBREAK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 33 wild scenes of jubilation in the Place Dauphine, the rue du Harlay and other approaches to the Law Courts. Calonne was burned in effigy, bonfires were lit on the Pont Neuf, fireworks and squibs were let off at the Guards. From Hardy's description and from the arrests made on 28 September (the climax of the disturbances) it is clear that the shock-troops in these riots were formed by the clerks of the Palais - " une jeunesse effrdnde " Hardy calls them - and the apprentices and journeymen of the luxury trades in the Place Dauphine; the " populace" of the surrounding quarters joined them but played only a subordinate part.22 The bourgeoisie was as yet uninvolved. In the months that followed it was the economic crisis, above all, that brought the " fourth estate " once more into the picture, either on their own account or (as in Paris) as the temporary ally of the dissident privileged orders. Brienne's return to the " free trade" measures of Turgot had led to a sharp rise in the price of grain; by July 1788, in the North at least, speculators were at work again and widespread complaints were voiced against forestalling and hoarding."3 At Troyes, the milice bourgeoise was already mustered in April to overawe the textile workers;24 and, in Paris, as we shall see, the high price of bread was to contribute to a popular outbreak in the late summer. Peasant revolt, however, lay dormant until the following spring, when long-simmering discontent with food-prices and seignorial exaction was to be touched off into violent outbreak by the political ferment emanating from the local electoral assemblies. Meanwhile, the political crisis had sharpened. Brienne had fallen back on the expedient of raising a loan, which the Paris Parlement was willing to accept, provided the States General should be summoned. But negotiations broke down again in November; the Duke of Orl6ans and two conseillers were exiled; and, in May 1788, the Parlement issued a declaration, condemning the whole system of arbitrary government, including the lettres de cachet. The Government riposted by ringing the Palais with troops, forced the Parlementaires to surrender their ringleaders to royal justice and promulgated six edicts, prepared by Lamoignon, the garde des sceaux, which restricted the jurisdiction of the Parlements and vested the royal courts and officials with greater powers. A new phase of violence followed: there were mass riots in Grenoble and Rennes in June;25 in the Dauphin6, nobility and Third Estate joined forces against the Crown in July. In early August, troops were concentrated around the capital for fear of an " insurrection," not so much of the Palais clerks and apprentices as of the menu peuple of the markets and the Faubourgs St. Antoine and St. Marcel.2"</page><page sequence="7">34 PAST AND PRESENT These fears proved well-founded. The Government was com- pelled to bow before the storm and promised that the States General would be called in May 1789; on 24 August, Brienne was replaced by Necker and the Parlement was recalled soon after. The news was greeted with another outburst of celebrations in the Place Dauphine and the approaches to the Palais: bonfires were lit and the occupants of coaches crossing the Pont Neuf were compelled to bow low to the statue of Henri IV and to shout "A bas Lamoignon!" A new factor, however, was to extend these disturbances far beyond the scope and limits of those of the previous year. On 17 August, the price of the 4-lb. loaf, after remaining at 9 sous, rose to 9J sous, on the 20th to IO sous, on 2 September to ioj sous, and on 7 September to II sous. Under this stimulus, the inhabitants of the Faubourgs joined in the riots on the third day (29 August) and changed their whole character: they spread to the markets and University quarter, continued - with short lulls - until the end of September and took a heavy toll in casualties and arrests; the latter were mainly composed of craftsmen and wage-earners of widely-scattered districts.27 The Parisian sans-culottes had entered the arena as a decisive force, but not yet as the ally of the bourgeoisie; the real revolutionary crisis was yet to come. This developed in the winter of 1788-9 and was to bring about a radical realignment of classes. The harvest was generally bad, and, in the Paris region, crops had been flattened by a freak hailstorm in July.2a There followed a winter of phenomenal severity which threw thousands out of work and brought further thousands of villagers flocking to the capital;2" in December, Hardy wrote of 8o,ooo unemployed.30 The price of the 4-lb. loaf in the Paris markets rose to 12 sous on 8 November, to 13 sous on the 28th, to 14 sous on II December and, finally, to 14? sous on I February; it was to remain at this level until after the fall of the Bastille.31 In April, in the grain-starved markets of the Paris region, the price of wheat rose to the fantastic sum of 40-44 francs the setier.32 Meanwhile, the crisis in industry - itself the offshoot of the agrarian crisis,83 though doubtless aggravated by the results of the Commercial Treaty with England in 17864 - had thrown thousands out of work in every textile centre: according to the reports of the industrial inspectors for September 1788 to January 1789, there were 46,ooo unemployed in Amiens, Io,ooo in Rouen, 8,ooo in Falaise, 30,000 in Carcassonne, 25,000 in Lyons; while at Troyes and Sedan half the looms were idle." It was against this economic background that the bourgeoisie</page><page sequence="8">THE OUTBREAK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 35 made its entry on the revolutionary stage. The cause of conflict had its roots deep in the Old Regime: while colonial trade, land- values and luxury spending had enormously increased in the course of the century, capital investment and expansion of manufacture were everywhere impeded by the restrictions imposed by privileged corporations, feudal landowners and Government on the elementary capitalist freedoms - the freedom to hire labour, the freedom to produce and the freedom to buy and sell. Yet, while the ensuing conflict owed its eventual sharpness and finality to these deeper social antagonisms, the clash between the bourgeoisie and the privileged orders arose, in the first instance, over representation and voting in the States General. Already in September, the Paris Parlement had shattered its reputation as the spokesman for " popular liberties " by demanding that the States General be constituted as in 1614 - i.e. that each order should have equal representation and vote separately. An even more forthright insistence on the maintenance of privilege was voiced in the Manifesto of the Princes of the Blood in December. Necker, however, persuaded the Council to allow the Third Estate double representation; but the question of voting " par tAte " (as demanded by the bourgeoisie) or " par ordre " (as insisted by the nobility and clergy) remained open and led to bloody clashes between nobles and commoners at Rennes. By January, the new alignment of forces was becoming clear and Mallet du Pan noted that it was no longer a question of a constitutional conflict between the King and the privildgids but a " war between the Third Estate and the two other orders."36 In February, the conflict was raised to a higher pitch by the publication of the Abbe Sieyes' pamphlet Qu'est-ce que le Tiers Etat?, in which the bourgeoisie, for the first time, laid claim to control the destinies of the nation irrespective of the wishes or privileges of the other orders. It is not surprising that, with these developments, the winter of 1788-9 should see the beginnings of a popular movement of an altogether vaster scope and intensity than those of the preceding years. This movement had other, even more significant, features: it became a continuous movement that did not cease until after the point of revolutionary outbreak; it grew from a movement concerned, in the first place, with purely economic ends into one with more or less clearly defined political aims; it developed a common bond of interest between the wage-earners, craftsmen, wine-growers,37 and small tradesmen of town and countryside against monopolists, hoarders and grain-speculators; this movement, in turn, began to " merge " with that of the small peasant proprietors against feudal</page><page sequence="9">36 PAST AND PRESENT game laws, tithes and dues; and, finally (though not always in point of time), the movement of townsmen and villagers " merged " with the political action of the bourgeoisie against feudal privilege and the whole apparatus of government of the Old Regime. The revolt against shortage and rising prices started in the last days of December 1788 and is recorded in the reports of the Intendants (or their sub-ddlhgues) of several provinces. It variously took the form of pillaging of grain-boats and granaries; of enforcing price-control of bread, flour and wheat; of rioting in bakers' shops and markets, and at town halls; of assaulting customs officials, dealers and farmers; and the widespread destruction of property. In December and January, such reports come in from Brittany and Touraine; in March and April, from Burgundy, the Ile de France, Languedoc, Nivernais, Orleanais, Picardy, Poitu, Provence and Touraine; in May and June, from the Limousin and Lyonnais; in July, from Champagne and Normandy.38 Hardy records bread- riots at Rheims in March and at Nancy and Toulouse in April.39 In the Faubourgs and markets of Paris, the high cost of meat and bread provoked a mounting wave of anger 40 which broke out into destructive violence in the R6veillon Riots in the Faubourg St. Antoine at the end of April.41 Ten " smugglers " were arrested at the barrikres in early May; this movement reached its climax on 12-14 July, when 40 of the 5o-odd customs posts ringing the capital were burned down.42 In the country north of Paris, the fight against famine developed into a movement against the game laws and the hunting rights of the nobility. On the estates of the Prince de Conti at Cergy, Pontoise, 1'Ile Adam and Beaumont, peasants and land-workers, having reaped no harvest owing to the ravages of hail, set out to trap and destroy the rabbits that infested their fields. The movement spread in the spring to Conflans Ste. Honorine and adjoining villages, and led to clashes with the mardchaussde.43 At Oisy, in the Artois, the peasants of a dozen villages banded together to exterminate the Count of Oisy's game and refused in future to pay him the traditional siyetd, or terrage.4 More violent clashes occurred near Corbeil and at Chatou; south and west of the capital, whole parishes, suspected of large-scale poaching on royal and aristocratic preserves, were disarmed in June.45 In Lorraine and the Hainaut, landless peasants and small laboureurs joined forces in opposition to enclosure edicts and land clearance schemes.46 Meanwhile, peasant revolt against royal taxes and seignorial exactions had broken out in Provence in March, at Gap in April, and in the Cambresis and Picardy in May.47 This</page><page sequence="10">THE OUTBREAK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 37 movement led, in turn, into that far vaster movement of July and August which, spreading over regions as widely scattered as Alsace, Normandy, the Hainaut, Maconnais and Franche-Comte, left in its trail the widespread destruction of chateaux and manorial rolls.48 Yet peasant hostility to enclosure and encroachment on rights of pasture led also to attacks on capitalist farmers; and, in more than one case again, the milice bourgeoise joined forces with the marichaussde to repress peasant disorder.49 Yet, in spite of such contradictions, as the crisis deepened, bourgeois and sans-culottes were drawn into closer partnership in opposition to the privileged orders and the feudal r6gime. The urban and peasant masses were never to be fully won for the bourgeois conception of " freedom " - this was to remain a cause of division throughout the Revolution - but it was in their common interest to remove the fetters on production and the high cost of food occasioned by internal customs duties and fiscal charges; to clip the wings of (if not to dispossess entirely) the tithe-owner and the extractor of feudal rente and champart; to reduce taxes and the ruinous costs of government; to compel the privileged orders to make a fair contribution to the national exchequer; to curb the monopolists and Farmers-General; to destroy such relics of ancient tyrannies as the Bastille, the lettre de cachet and the vexatious inquisitions of the Parlements. It is precisely such demands that we find voiced most frequently in the cahiers de doldances which began to be drawn up in the early months of 1789 - usually drafted, it is true, by the professional bourgeoisie, but often endorsed by meetings of peasants, small tradesmen and workshop masters, and even, though more rarely (as at Rheims, Marseilles, Troyes and Lyons) by guilds of journeymen or inattres-ouvriers.50 And the States General roused such ardent hopes - " la grande esperance," Georges Lefebvre has called its - because it was widely believed that, cleared of the obstruction and domination of the privileged orders, it could realize a radical programme of this kind. From these hopes stem the enthusiastic adoption of the slogan, " Vive le Tiers Etat !" (which is certainly thought to include the " Fourth Estate " as well),52 and the passionate belief, once the Court Party began to threaten to dash these hopes to the ground, in the existence of an " aristocratic plot." It was in direct response to this stimulus that the Parisian journeymen, labourers, workshop masters and shop-keepers - already roused to action by the ruinous cost of bread, meat and wine - rallied to the call of the revolutionary leadership installed at the Palais Royal and - less certainly - to that</page><page sequence="11">38 PAST AND PRESENT set up by the Electors of the Paris Third Estate at the H6tel de Ville; it was also this conviction that the Court Party was preparing to disperse the States General and to subdue Paris with the aid of foreign troops, far more than the gold of the Duke of Orleans, that won over the main body of the Paris garrison, the Gardes Frangaises - so recently engaged in shooting down the Reveillon rioters - to the side of the Revolution. When Necker, the popular Finance Minister, was dismissed by the King on 12 July, the people of the Faubourgs and the markets joined with the bourgeois revolutionaries and the disaffected troops in carrying through the Paris insurrection- the first great armed uprising of the Revolution. The gunsmiths, arsenals and religious houses were raided for arms, the hated barridres were destroyed, a milice bourgeoise (including jouneymen, but excluding " vagrants " and unemployed workers) was organized, a revolutionary government was installed at the H6tel de Ville, and, finally, the Bastille was taken by storm. The popular movement had fully " merged" with that of the revolutionary bourgeoisie; the example was quickly followed in other parts of France. Labrousse tells us that the Bastille fell on the very day when the price of grain throughout France reached its cyclical peak.53 This is no doubt significant, but it would be a mistake to attempt to explain the revolutionary crisis wholly in such terms. To do so would be to discount entirely the revolutionary action of the bourgeoisie and the permeation of the Parisian menu peuple with the political ideas and slogans of the Third Estate. It is evident that the basic motive prompting popular action was the high cost of food and the fear of famine. This continued to be so and is the most constant element in the repeated upsurge of the popular movement during the years of the Revolution - in August-November 1789, in the years 1792-3 and, above all, in I795.54 Yet there was a similar fear of famine in 1768; and, in 1775, as we have seen, the fears thus aroused led to a massive movement of popular protest; yet in neither case did a revolutionary outbreak result. This was because the economic and political crisis as a whole - and not one single aspect of it, however important - had not fully matured and because the conflict of social classes which it occasioned was as yet only one-sided and partial; above all, it was because one of these classes, the bourgeoisie, although dissatisfied with the inequalities, the corruption, the ex- travagance and the restrictions of the Old R6gime, had not yet begun seriously to challenge the absolute monarchy or the privileged orders, or the social system on which they depended. It was only when the bourgeoisie entered the revolutionary struggle, as it did in the winter</page><page sequence="12">THE OUTBREAK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 39 of 1788-9, that the popular masses were able to acquire a political direction and a set of political aims and concepts - such concepts as Third Estate, Nation, " complot aristocratique " and the Rights of Man - without which they would have expended their energies on actions limited to economic ends. This is not to underrate the importance of their contribution; without their intervention, the bourgeois revolutionaries of July 1789 - many of whom were stricken by panic at the crucial moment of insurrection - would have been doomed and the recently constituted National Assembly dispersed by royal troops. Yet, for all their vacillations and fears - fears of the Court Party and of the masses themselves - in the social condit- ions of the day, the insurrection could not have been successfully carried out without the direction and political guidance of the deputies, journalists, pamphleteers and Electors of the Third Estate. It was, in fact, to be one of the great lessons of the French Revolution that the popular movement, however militant and widespread, could only succeed and survive as an effective revolutionary force as long as it was allied to an important section of the bourgeoisie; conversely, that the bourgeoisie could only carry out its historical task of destroying feudal property relations as long as they, or a substantial part of them, maintained their links with the broad masses of town and countryside. Nothing is to be gained by omitting one side or other of this picture, as some historians have done. In July, 1789, as we have seen, at the moment of revolutionary crisis, the immediate interests of the masses coincided with those of the main body of the bourgeoisie and even of a minority of the privileged class itself. In the following autumn, as so often in the course of the Revolution, the preoccupation of the Parisian menu peuple with the problems of high prices and shortage threatened to disrupt the alliance by directing their main fury against the monopolists and the newly constituted city authorities; and it was only by the harnessing of this movement to the political tasks set by the Constitutional Monarchists that the Royal Family was brought to Paris and the National Assembly was once more saved. Similar situations arose - though with changing forms of alliance, as the bourgeois-democratic revolution advanced - in the years 1791-4; but, in the summer of 1794, when the Revolutionary Government was compelled by its own contradictions to sacrifice the interests of the sans-culottes, the alliance was broken and Robespierre fell an easy victim to the intrigues of his enemies. In the spring and early summer of 1795, attempts were made to reconstitute it at the time of the massive popular insurrections of Germinal and Prairial;</page><page sequence="13">40 PAST AND PRESENT but, at the crucial moment, the radical wing of the bourgeoisie deserted, either from weakness or from fear of the masses, and the popular movement was finally crushed. It was only to rise again - and under very different conditions - in 1830. London. George E. Rudd. NOTES 1 The main exponents of this " conspiracy "- thesis are Taine, Cochin and Gaxotte.

Villages in the neighbourhood of the Royal forests of Fountainebleau, St. Germain, etc. had been protesting against damage done to their crops by rabbits, deer, etc. almost continuously for the past I5 years. There is, however, no sign of armed revolt in these districts until April 1789 (ibid.). 48 M. Bloch, " La lutte pour l'individualisme agraire dans la France du xviiie siecle," Annales d'Histoire dconomique et sociale, ii (1930), 532-43. I am indebted to Mr. Alun Davies for this reference, as for several other valuable suggestions concerning the peasant movement of the period. 47 Lefebvre, La Revolution Fran aise, p.

The earliest popular use that I have found in police records of the term " tiers etat " in this militant sense is on 21 April 1789 (Arch. Nat. Y 18762). The slogan " Vive le Tiers Etat!" was heard in the Reveillon Riots a week later (Arch. Nat. KK 641, fo. I7).
