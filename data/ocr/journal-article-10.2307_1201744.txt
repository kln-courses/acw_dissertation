<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mysticism and Despair in Abraham J. Heschel's Religious Thought Edward K. Kaplan Abraham Joshua Heschel's religious vision embraces both mysticism and de- spair. Heschel defined his approach to religion in one of his first published articles, "The Mystical Element in Judaism" (1949). Quite simply, it presup- poses "a yearning after the unattainable ... [a need] to grasp with the senses what is hidden from the mind . . . to experience as a reality what vaguely dawns in intuitions"' -in a word, to meet God directly. At the same time Heschel assumes that we must relinquish all human confidence before we can give space to God. This radical approach to religion-a consequence of his "Depth Theology"2 -appears both accessible and remote to the faithful. His powerful confidence and impassioned language appeal to their most intense yearnings and memories. Inversely, Heschel threatens believers who are un- willing to confront their own skepticism and disbelief and who avoid the painful suspicion that theology is illusion or fantasy. Heschel removes our usual distance from such feelings, while, as a moral critic, he demands con- crete, practical compassion for others. He repudiates any safeguard against excruciating overinvolvement. Those who insulate their emotions from the daily evidence of armed conflicts, starvation, economic and social oppres- sion-or deny the mediocrity of contemporary religious institutions-will thus have difficulty facing Heschel's religious standards. His picture of today reflects Pascal's condemnation of seventeenth-century France where people "diverted" themselves from honest, lucid recognition of human frailty or "misery." Both rebuke the psychological resistances, denial mechanisms, and complacency subversive to spiritual and moral courage. Heschel continues Pascal when he demolishes the rationalizations which iso- late us from our fellows and from God. Both Heschel and Pascal seek to conquer that double alienation by having us experience it radically. '"The Mystical Element in Judaism," in The Jews: Their History, Culture, and Religion, ed.

Heschel," Conservative Judaism 28, no. 1 (Fall 1973): 40-49. 33</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion Yet anxiety is hardly the characteristic tenor of Heschel's works; his task was to awaken within readers (believers and unbelievers alike) a desire to experience God's presence. "For faith is not the clinging to a shrine but an endless pilgrimage of the heart. Audacious longing, burning songs, daring thoughts, an impulse overwhelming the heart, usurping the mind-these are all a drive toward serving Him who rings our hearts like a bell."3 He did this primarily by evoking his love of God in enchantingly poetic prose. As an apologist, like Pascal, he envisaged a literary corpus which would respond to secular agnosticism, atheism, or free thinking with the witness of religious belief and practice. Heschel lived longer than Pascal and explored his tradi- tion more fully; he dealt with more specific issues than the author of the Pen- sies. A modern reader, whether Jewish or not, can find in Abraham Heschel's works answers to most problems raised by Jewish doctrines and history. Heschel evokes the cultural development of his Hasidic background in The Earth Is the Lord's (1950). He delineates experiential and philosophical inter- pretations of Jewish views of humanity and the world in Man Is Not Alone (1951), while focusing particularly on Jewish revelation and orthopraxis in God in Search of Man (1955). These two books constitute the foundation of his apologetics. He explains the activist morality of prophetic consciousness in The Prophets (1962) and illustrates the rich inner experiences of prayer and ritual in The Sabbath (1951) and Man's Quest for God (1954). Specific moral and political problems are addressed in The Insecurity of Freedom (1966) and in Israel: An Echo of Eternity (1969). The author's extraordinary literary gifts, his almost uncanny ability to capture the feeling of different modes of religious experience, nourish all of his writings. These books, and the essays and arti- cles which extend them, assume an unshaking confidence in God's love for humanity and in mankind's capacity to respond to that concern compassion- ately and responsibly. Heschel confronts modern conceptions of the absurd in his Stanford Uni- versity lectures, Who Is Man? (1965). This succinct essay challenges atheistic philosophies of despair and meaninglessness. Reflection on humanity is never detached; it requires full personal involvement, painful concern, a response to mankind's essential perplexity. Authentic philosophical and sacred meaning must emerge from spiritual anguish. Yet only in his final work-A Passion for Truth (1973)-centered on two abrasive religious dissenters, Soren Kierke- gaard and Reb Mendel of Kotzk, did Heschel directly express his own an- guish at evil and religious decadence. This book-published after the author's sudden death-expresses a Camus-like biting irony more forcefully than his earlier works. Heschel's outrage echoes these two spiritual radicals and confronts the pervasive condition of the twentieth century: a demolished faith in mankind and its God. 3 Abraham Heschel, Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Harper Torchbooks, 1951), p. 175 (hereafter cited as Not Alone). 34</page><page sequence="3">Mysticism and Despair A closer look reveals that Heschel's vision of human existence, like that of Pascal, was always both realistic and faithful. He is fully aware of humanity's loneliness without God, and he responds to our radical doubt and despair with an equally radical challenge: that of mystical experience, direct confir- mation of the divine. How does this conform to Heschel's function as philoso- pher? How does his appeal to readers' intellectual assent encourage tradi- tional religious belief? My view is that Heschel's apologetics has broader pertinence. Its fundamental intent follows Herbert Fingarette's explanation of the mystical teacher: "The mystic's words are like [a psychoanalyst's] ther- apeutic interventions: they are designed to be effective in producing specific change, not to embody universal truths. The 'pattern' underlying the mystic's words is, in short, pragmatic, not logical."4 Heschel philosophizes in order to cleanse our illusions. He first casts us adrift and so prepares a meeting with God which begins in meaninglessness and dread. OUT OF THE DARKNESS Openness to God requires a relative emptying of oneself. The parallel be- tween Heschel and Pascal explains the Jewish thinker's role as philosopher of religion: to destroy unquestioned preconceptions through intellectual argu- mentation for the purpose of opening readers to an experience of the holy. True-and this issue must be scrutinized in detail-Heschel's argumenta- tions often appear incomplete and, at best, unconvincing by normal philo- sophical standards.5 Philosophers consider that the most obvious weakness of his endeavor. But is that not the problem of all apologetics? An apologist of faith is limited. The apologist must prepare human reason and emotion to pass beyond themselves so that God may manifest himself. Our appreciation of Heschel should not diminish if we do not expect God to answer. More important are Heschel's belief in God's availability and his sensitivity to those without faith. Heschel does discover our despair and uses it as an instrument of redemption. His religious philosophy, first and foremost, derives its special potency from the notion of radical amazement: "Wonder or radical amazement is the chief 4Herbert Fingarette, The Self in Transformation: Psychoanalysis, Philosophy, and the Life of the Spirit (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Torchbooks, 1965), p. 305. I have found this to be the best study of the relationship of religious experience to personal growth. It is not at all reductionistic. 5 See the recent essay of Gershom Scholem, "Jewish Theology Today," Center Magazine 7, no. 2 (March/April 1974): 58--71; Scholem mentions in passing Heschel and Martin Buber as "existential theologians" who have evaded the real issues of revelation (p. 63); see also Emil Fackenheim's criticism of Man Is Not Alone in Judaism 1, no. 1 (January 1952): 85-89, and his review of God in Search of Man in Conservative Judaism 15, no. 1 (Fall 1960): 50-53. Important suggestions have been made by Fritz A. Rothschild, "The Religious Thought of Abraham J. Heschel," Conservative Judaism 23, no. 1 (Fall 1968): 12-24; Edmond LaB.

Hes- chel," Judaism 25, no. 1 (Winter 1976): 65-78. 35</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion characteristic of the religious man's attitude toward history and nature."6 The relevance of his mystical approach to God is explained by the dynamics of radical amazement or wonder, as Heschel understands it: wonder is the Janus-face of despair. Amazement is an attitude which takes nothing for granted: being itself, the very fact of my existence, is unbelievable.7 In radi- cal amazement we apprehend the world as an allusion to its deeper, spiritual meaning. Heschel believes that this experience frees us from common as- sumptions about reality and is a pristine intuition of the sacred mystery of existence. Mystery leads to the discovery of ultimate meaning, of God's pres- ence beyond the obscure enigma of the world. Heschel emphasizes the specificity of radical amazement at the beginning of Man Is Not Alone and God in Search of Man by comparing it to its opposite, philosophical doubt. His distinction assumes two directions of the mind: doubt is concerned with self, while wonder focuses upon what is greater than the individual: "There is no word in Biblical Hebrew for doubt; there are many expressions of wonder. Just as in dealing with judgments our starting point is doubt, wonder is the Biblical starting point in facing reality . Doubt is an act in which the mind inspects its own ideas; wonder is an act in which the mind confronts the universe. Radical skepticism is the outgrowth of subtle conceit and self-reliance. Yet there was no conceit in the prophets and no self-reliance in the Psalmist."8 Heschel's antithesis is perhaps too harshly drawn. We must understand this frequently used polemic device in its proper context. He intentionally emphasizes one element at the other's expense in order to distinguish clearly between secular philosophy and biblical witness. As an apologist he must demonstrate the limits of the former in answering questions of ultimate import. He does not appear to take doubt seriously because, in this instance, it cannot translate the biblical vision of reality into modern terms. His rejection of doubt as a valuable mode of religious under- standing should bring us out of ourselves; if we transcend the arrogance of doubt we may become receptive to biblical faith. The true depth of Heschel's witness emerges when we switch from the perspective of the uncertain believer to that of the searching unbeliever. The radical amazement which we all wish to enjoy indeed ends in appreciation, but it begins with a radical incapacity to believe confidently what we think we already know. The dynamics of amazement-as opposed to Heschel's polemic presentation of it-takes fully into account the necessity of radical doubt. This is the pragmatic function of his philosophical argumentation which is more fundamental, in my view, than its own validity. By constantly and relentlessly criticizing our accepted mental cliches, Heschel confronts us 6 Abraham Heschel, God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism (New York: Meridian Press and the Jewish Publication Society, 1955), p. 45 (hereafter cited as In Search). 7 See Not Alone, p. 12. 8 In Search, p. 98. 36</page><page sequence="5">Mysticism and Despair with our finitude. Terror at our nothingness reinforces our capacity to enjoy creation: "What is extraordinary [usually] appears to us as habit, the dawn a daily routine of nature. But time and again we awake. In the midst of walk- ing in the never-ending procession of days and nights, we are suddenly filled with a solemn terror, with a feeling that our wisdom is inferior to dust. We cannot endure the heartbreaking splendor of sunsets."' Habit has frozen our sense of nature's astounding beauties which, though periodic, demonstrate to Heschel the workings of divine concern. What appears to the routinized mind as a predictable physical phenomenon speaks to the religious person of God's glorious presence. Sometimes our minds are so rigid, claims Heschel, that only the most violent dislocation will awaken our sense of the holy. Both believers and the faithless are susceptible to anesthesia of the spirit. Heschel's rational argumentation chips away at our intellectual complacency so that, some day, we may face the "solemn terror, [the] feeling that our wisdom is inferior to dust." His biblical exegesis, poetic evocations, and personal testi- mony also prepare that awakening, but in such a way that we are inspired by "the heartbreaking splendor of sunsets." One further consequence-and the most radical-emerges from Heschel's "philosophical housecleaning" procedure. At its outer limit stands a condition in which belief and disbelief are equally paralyzed, when the mind is void of certainty, the self of any power. Heschel does not deny the horrifying possibility of a deathlike state of the soul. Readers who follow Heschel's fullest implications risk losing the most elementary of intellectual necessities, that of language itself: "Only those who have gone through days in which words were of no avail, on which the most brilliant theories jarred the ear like mere slang; only those who have experienced ultimate not-knowing, the voicelessness of a soul struck by won- der, total muteness, are able to enter the meaning of God, a meaning greater than the mind."10 The alliteration and rhythmic fullness of this long, power- ful sentence convey an authenticity which cannot but probe a sensitive reader to the depths. Heschel boldly asserts that ultimate meaning appears across the boundary of meaninglessness and despair. Words and theories are an- nulled. Paradoxically, this uncovers the positive side of nothingness. Heschel's "ultimate not-knowing" and "total muteness" produce a "voiceless wonder," a thorough letting go of the mind in which the presence of God becomes available. Such terror is indeed solemn: it vibrates with an awesome tran- scendent presence. Heschel's demand is frighteningly clear: "We must first peer through the darkness, feel strangled and entombed in the hopelessness of living without God, before we are ready to feel the presence of His living light."" Both the mystic and the reflective atheist or agnostic may experience this 9 Not Alone, p. 35. 10o In Search, p. 140. " Ibid. 37</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion utter darkness and despair.'2 Nothing is more real, nor unfortunately more accessible to most people. When we gain the courage to face the truth of our lives, we stand at this nadir of the isolated soul, abandoned or misunderstood by loved ones, oblivious to self-respect, hopeless and alone. The absence of God became an objective experience of Jewish history when Hitler's soldiers and bureaucrats annihilated a civilization embodied in 6 million individuals. Our daily contact in the mass media with wars; racial, political, and class hatreds; poverty; and natural catastrophes poisons our sense of human digni- ty and significance. We either fear that our destiny is completely out of control or that it depends on the mercy of a handful of stupid, power-starved madmen. To those outside Western religious faith, the death of God has heralded the death of his murderer.' Depression has become one of today's most realistic modes of moral sensitivity and despair its common idiom. We experience the eclipse of humanity as individuals. Yet many people who allow themselves to perceive their real condition survive desolation through hopeful action, while most of us, fearing the shadow of insanity, lull this sight of reality with routine. Heschel's apologetics embraces this realistic anguish and leads us to the frontier of mystical faith. Heschel's critique of the individual is thus two-fold: "We [can] discover that the self in itself [my italics] is a montrous deceit, [and] that the self is something transcendent in disguise."'4 These two perceptions are not incom- patible, though they appear at different moments of religious insight. He is reaching beyond our psychological, social, and intellectual identities. As we surrender our self-sufficient ideas we open to the world's sacred dimension. Heschel's mysticism explodes the walled-in categories which imprison, over- shadow, our dimension as a cryptic image of the divine. MYSTICAL ILLUMINATION Heschel rehearses the itinerary from utter darkness to mystical illumination in the chapter of Man Is Not Alone entitled "In the Presence of God." This text is the pivot point of his apologetics and, one could say without exaggeration, dramatizes the unity of his entire work: the harmony of inward piety and prophetic activism. The episode's general structure demonstrates how God's self-disclosure leads to a fundamental commitment by the mystic to a moral and holy life. 12 The Trappist monk Thomas Merton has defined similar bases of dialogue between believ- ers and people without faith in "The Contemplative and the Atheist," in Contemplation in a World of Action (New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., Image Books, 1973), pp. 180-94; see nn. 18 and 28 below for other parallels. 13 This view has been most dramatically expressed by Michel Foucault, The Order of Things (New York: Random House, Vintage Books, 1973), esp. chaps. 9 and 10. Compare Martin Buber, The Eclipse of God (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Harper Torchbooks, 1957). 14 Not Alone, p. 47. 38</page><page sequence="7">Mysticism and Despair This moment is preceded in the book by an argumentation meant to pro- duce a "profound awareness of the incongruity of all categories with the nameless unfathomable omnipresence of the mystery."'5 Heschel then zeros in on the helplessness which reflective people discover at crucial times in life. He uses an image worthy of Kafka to express this excruciating state: the human condition becomes "a vast cage within a maze, high as our mind, wide as our power of will, long as a life span."'6 Human conceptions of thought, individual volition, and time bound the self. Those who question the meaning of existence can "either live on the sumptuous, dainty diet within the cage [or] look for the exit to the maze in order to search for freedom in the darkness of the undisclosed." Heschel's philosophizing should now bear fruit: we must regurgitate the "dainty diet" of unquestioned cliches. Heschel has replaced rational discourse with highly condensed imagery and extended metaphor. We are caught in the vise of poetic logic, concretely fearful of the endless labyrinth within. He appeals to our desire for freedom and encourages us to confront the "darkness of the undisclosed." True, secu- lar humanism can be an authentic form of courage in face of the sightless night; Sartre's atheistic existentialism, for example, affirms the power of the lonely individual actively to create its destiny. Heschel confronts this same loneliness, but with a further demand: that human commitment be directed toward and by ultimate reality; his realism is spiritual. With a confidence given only to those who have seen God, he pushes us beyond any humanly inspired hope. Those who have not yet discovered the divine are plummeted into despair: "They have no power to spend on faith any more, no goal to strive for, no strength to seek a goal." Human desire is utterly stilled."7 Heschel's representation of mystical illumination (which he often calls rev- elation) bursts through the numbness of radical self-alienation. It is the crisis of his apologetics and bridges religious insight and religious living. This pas- sage from Man Is Not Alone (pp. 77-79) evokes a filling of the void just de- scribed. It is one of Heschel's literary masterpieces and seeks to express an ineffable meeting with God. His incandescently poetic prose conveys more than emotional conviction; it is rigorously organized to translate the tran- scendent event: But, then, a moment comes like a thunderbolt, in which a flash of the undisclosed rends our dark apathy asunder. It is full of overpowering brilliance, like a point in which all moments of life are focused or a thought which outweighs all thoughts ever 15 Ibid., p. 44. 16 My analysis profited from the sensitive paper written by Janet Allen (Smith '75) for my course, Mysticism and the Moral Life, May 1973. Compare chap. 13 of In Search (pp. 136-44), which also describes a mystical breakthrough. 17 It is worth stressing a self-evident fact: in teaching such material one should appropriately emphasize the risks of involuntary self-surrender. The mystic writer, unlike most of us, knows that this loss of personality is temporary. 39</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion conceived of. There is so much light in our cage, in our world, it is as if it were suspended amidst the stars. Apathy turns to splendor unawares. The ineffable has shuddered itself into the soul. It has entered our consciousness like a ray of light passing into a lake. Refraction of that penetrating ray brings about a turning in our mind: We are penetrated by His insight. One cannot think any more as if He were there and we here. He is both there and here. He is not a being, but being in and beyond all beings. The text's structure conveys its author's interpretation. Close analysis clari- fies how Heschel intends to transform his readers' manner of thinking and capture his or her assent. The comparison of mystical insight with a thunder- bolt renders almost visually concrete the penetration of the soul (a dark cloud) by God.'" The sky is ripped apart with a crashing boom in an exqui- site, yet painful, spectacle of prodigious strength. The image of "dark apathy" illustrates human emptiness and a total cessation of will-an abandon which could lead to passive despair, to death, or to God. Emotionless indifference is the most drastic contrary of the ego assertion Heschel the philosopher con- stantly combats. He trusts that apathy will lead to positive surrender. The "undisclosed" then becomes manifest "like a point in which all mo- ments of life are focused." The ineffable enters the soul in a flash, blinding normal thought but at the same time illuminating a heightened con- sciousness. One can imagine a simultaneous recall of previous experiences, past events viewed in an instant side by side. (People who picture themselves falling to their death from cliffs or high buildings often include that in their fantasy.) Here, an awareness of God accompanies this enhanced self-scrutiny; the divine presence "outweighs all thought ever conceived of" and gives life unheard-of focus: "There is so much light in our cage, in our world, it is as if it were suspended amidst the stars." The world-prison metaphor is abolished as the inner illumination casts its brilliance outside; in other words, God endows human life with new meaning. A completely transformed vision of reality arises from depression and from the death of the old self: "Apathy turns to splendor unawares." This striking- ly short sentence summarizes the mystical meeting, which Heschel insists has resulted from a revelation, a self-disclosure on God's part to humanity: "The ineffable has shuddered itself into our soul." Contrasted to the usual desire of the human soul to possess God, the initiative, in this case, is clearly from the laCompare the chapter of Thomas Merton's Bread in the Wilderness (Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, 1971) entitled "Dark Lightning" (pp. 101-8), which describes the modalities of mystical experience in a way which parallels Heschel; compare also The Seven Storey Mountain (New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., Image Books, 1948), pp. 341-45, for a presentation of Merton's own illumination. I hope that scholars will explore in detail the parallels between these two outstanding contemporary mystics. For a suggestive beginning see Hal Bridges, American Mysti- cism, from William James to Zen (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1970), chap. 4, "The Varieties of Mysticism" (pp. 51-74), devoted to Heschel, Merton, and Howard Thurman. 40</page><page sequence="9">Mysticism and Despair other side.'9 In terms of Heschel's literary representation, the "shudder," a physical as well as emotional sensation, communicates to receptive readers the author's identification with his images. The passage has gathered momen- tum, the rhythm quickens and climaxes. It now introduces the personality's radical reorientation: "It has entered our consciousness like a ray of light passing into a lake. Refraction of that penetrating ray brings about a turning in our mind. We are penetrated by His insight." The normal subject-object perspective is reversed. Heschel's mystic, instead of gaining an insight into the nature of the Deity, becomes aware of being understood by God. (See Ps. 139: "O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me! . . . ") This discovery exemplifies the most fundamental princi- ple of Heschel's religious thought: the displacement of subjectivity from hu- manity to God.20 The mystic is not absorbed into the divine subject; rather, he or she now understands human reality from God's view. God is no longer utterly remote, transcendent, absent: "[God] is both there and here. [He is] being in and beyond all things." This is the insight to which the entire experience points: the paradoxical understanding of God's simultaneous immanence and transcendence. God is no longer a concept, an abstract answer at the end of a chain of questions. To the mystic God is being. Not a static substance, a noun; God is a verb, a living force, God-ing himself into our lives. Heschel elaborates the refraction of this experience into the consciousness of the mystic in the paragraph which directly follows; this text displays the same combination of ecstatic evocation and rigorous sequencing. But the illumination, this time, becomes more precisely interpreted: A tremor seizes our limbs; our nerves are struck, quiver like strings; our whole being bursts into shudders. But then a cry, wrested from our very core, fills the world around us, as if a mountain were suddenly about to place itself in front of us. It is one word: GOD. Not an emotion, a stir within us, but a power, a marvel beyond us, tearing the world apart. The word that means more than universe, more than eternity, holy, holy, holy; we cannot comprehend it. We only know it means infinitely more than we are able to echo. Staggered, embarrassed, we stammer and say: He, who is more than all 19 Some confusion arises concerning Heschel's terminology. He makes a mutually exclusive contrast between revelation and mysticism in In Search, chap. 20, "The Paradox of Sinai": "The mystic experience is an ecstasy of man; revelation is an ecstasy of God" (p. 199). Heschel repeats this distinction in chap. 21 of The Prophets, "An Examination of the Theory of Ecstasy." In both instances mysticism gets short shrift. It is clear to me-though there is no space here to prove it- that Heschel conveniently limited his definition of mysticism for the immediate needs of his exposition, as he did with the doubt/wonder dichotomy examined above. His purpose was to illuminate the dynamics of revelation as opposed to the common (and superficial) conception of mysticism. This paper focuses on other texts and, I hope, amply demonstrates how broad Heschel's characterization of mystical experience actually is. 20 Some consequences of this notion related to Heschel's treatment of anthropomorphism, prophetic inspiration, prayer, and moral sensitivity are examined in my paper, "Language and Reality in Abraham J. Heschel's Philosophy of Religion," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 41, no. 1 (March 1973): 94-111; see also Friedman (n. 5 above), pp. 72-74. 41</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion there is, who speaks through the ineffable, whose question is more than our mind can answer; He to whom our life can be the spelling of an answer.21 Intense kinesthetic reactions to divine revelation-the tremors, nerves quiver- ing like strings, and, again, the shudders-produce an active, articulate re- sponse, a cry: GOD. Heschel takes his place among the most effective mysti- cal writers who convey their speechless, imageless contacts with the transcendent in dramatic sensorial language. Readers can comprehend that mountain quake in more than a physical sense; we can imagine the pain and power conveyed by a moment in which divine awareness might flash behind our minds. Yet I cannot imagine God; but can anyone? Heschel is not des- cribing God as he is in himself, but human reactions to that presence. He insists that this feeling is a response to an objective reality, that the feeling accompanies, not produces intuition of the divine: "Not an emotion, a stir within us, but a power, a marvel beyond us, tearing the world apart." God's presence in the person augments that self by disclosing its divine foundation; God actualizes the essence of the human being as divine image. We can only sing, praise: "holy, holy, holy; we cannot comprehend it." We worship. Or as Heschel so beautifully states: to be truly human we must be more than hu- man.22 Inward confirmation of God's existence, however, is not the homeland of this spiritual odyssey; quite the contrary. Our yearning for knowledge of the divine, when surrendered, opens us to the ultimate question, that is, God's question to us. Heschel's mysticism, rather than providing answers to reli- gious perplexity, creates greater problems. The solution is the problem. Reli- gious faith, fortified by direct contact with God, just clarifies the higher chal- lenge. The bare word "GOD" articulates a message: "He . . . who speaks through the ineffable, whose question is more than our mind can answer; He to whom our life can be the spelling of an answer." Heschel's final sentence- incomplete because it contains no verb-is a synonym for God; a pure pres- ence repeats the unending question to Adam, to all humanity: where are you? THE MYSTIC WAY OF LIFE Heschel, like most mystics, points to the demand of God that we integrate spectacular insight into the here and now. "The Mystical Element in Juda- 21 Not Alone, p. 78. 22 Heschel repeats this observation in several books and articles, but in The Earth Is the Lord's he extends it to a complex and central issue: "There is a price to be paid by the Jew. He has to be exalted in order to be normal. In order to be a man, he has to be more than a man. To be a people, the Jews have to be more than a people" (p. 64). See n. 36 on the universality of mystical Judaism. 42</page><page sequence="11">Mysticism and Despair ism," his seminal article quoted in the beginning, demonstrates how tradition requires this view. That study anticipates everything Heschel subsequently wrote and is the theoretical center from which emanates his entire mission. It begins with a definition of "the meaning of Jewish mysticism," elaborated in Man Is Not Alone and God in Search of Man: "What our senses perceive is but the jutting edge of what is deeply hidden."23 The modern experience of mankind's alienation reflects the traditional doctrine of the Shekinah, the pres- ence of God dwelling within the world; that doctrine is the theological foun- dation of Heschel's ethics: "God is, so to speak, involved in the tragic state of the world. . ... Not only Israel but the whole universe, even the Shekinah, 'lies in the dust' and is in exile." Prophetic urgency demands that we identify with God's exile and refuse the world's tragic message. The fulfilled mystic must become a moral activist: "The ultimate goal of the cabalist is not his own union with the Absolute but the union of all reality with God; one's own bliss is subordinated to the redemption of all."24 Two essential aspects of "The Mystical Element in Judaism" ought also to be mentioned. It contains a large number of quotations from the Zohar which is, with the Bible and rabbinical tradition, the scriptural source of Jewish mysticism, and it evokes the mystic's special consciousness of common reality. The fact of his precise quotations is significant, for readers unfamiliar with Heschel's technical German, Hebrew, and Yiddish writings25 may not recognize the implicit scholarly foundation of The Earth Is the Lord's, Man Is Not Alone, and Man's Quest for God. (The Sabbath, God in Search of Man, and The Prophets are more completely documented.) What Heschel's article suggests about mystical consciousness in general was developed in Man Is Not Alone- the apologetic work most explicitly directed toward religiously uncommitted readers of all backgrounds. The general organization of Man Is Not Alone, like "The Mystical Ele- ment," recapitulates the full religious response demanded by Heschel. Part 1, "The Problem of God," describes the path to a dynamic faith and an ongoing relationship with God. Part 2, "The Problem of Living," completes Heschel's philosophy of religion with a definition of humanity-its needs, aspirations, and responsibilities-compatible with an awareness of God's presence. The final chapter, "The Pious Man," is a portrait of the religious ideal, "a media- 23 "The Mystical Element in Judaism," p. 603.

This person, the Hasid, is another synonym of Heschel's mystic. His or her perception fulfills in a com- plete and spontaneous manner the displacement of subjectivity from humani- ty to God which structures the seeker's quest: "He is not aiming to penetrate into the sacred. Rather he is striving to be himself penetrated and actuated by the sacred, eager to . . . identify himself with every trend in the world which is toward the divine. . . . Piety is the realization and verification of the transcendent in human life."26 Experience of a divine dimension in the everyday is the essence of Hasi- dism-a fact which another modern proponent of this view, Martin Buber, constantly stresses.27 For Heschel, born and nurtured within this tradition, mystical awareness is literal and concrete; it is no surprise that he confronted modern thought and devoted his life to its realization. Christians will recog- nize in that ideal a companion of their own bountiful contemplative tradi- tion. Thomas Merton, the contemporary Christian writer who most intimate- ly resembles Heschel in his intellectual penetration, worldliness, moral militancy, and inward piety, defines the mystical vocation as "a way of pray- er, or of contemplation, or simply living [my italics], in which the direct action and influence of God tend to absorb the activity of our natural faculties, raising them to a habitually supernatural level. The characteristic mark of true Christian mysticism is not a succession of flamboyant experiences and phenomena, but a life of constant peace, recollection, absorption in God, charity, humility and, last but not least, balance and common sense, even in the midst of great trials, distracting duties, or heroic suffering."28 Here, finally, is Heschel's portrayal of Jewish contemplative consciousness: The pious man is possessed by his awareness of the presence and nearness of God. Everywhere and at all times he lives as in His sight, whether he remains always heedful of His proximity or not. He feels embraced by God's mercy as by a vast encircling space. Awareness of God is as close to him as the throbbing of his own heart, often deep and calm but at times overwhelming, intoxicating, setting the soul afire. The momentous reality of God stands there as peace, power and endless tran- quility, as an inexhaustible source of help, as boundless compassion, as an open gate awaiting prayer. It sometimes happens that the life of a pious man becomes so in- volved in God that his heart overflows as though it were a cup in the hand of God. 26 Not Alone, pp. 280-81. 27 See Martin Buber, The Origin and Meaning of Hasidism (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Harper Torchbooks, 1960), and of course his two-volume collection, Tales of the Hasidim (New York: Schocken Books, 1947-48). There is a crying need for comparative studies of these two leaders of contemporary Jewish thought. 28Thomas Merton, The Waters of Siloe (New York: Harcourt Brace &amp; Co., 1949), p. 364, glossary, article "Mysticism"; see also Bread in the Wilderness, p. 102, for a definition of "living faith" as an ardor of love that constitutes a kind of indirect experience of God. The chapters of The Seven Storey Mountain devoted to the Trappists contain eloquent evocations of contemplative consciousness, esp. pp. 382-85. 44</page><page sequence="13">Mysticism and Despair This presence of God is not like the proximity of a mountain or the vicinity of an ocean, the view of which one may relinquish by closing the eyes or removing from the place. Rather is this convergence with God unavoidable, inescapable; like air in space, it is always breathed in, even though one is not always aware of continuous respiration.29 Heschel's path toward God has reached culmination. He believes that such confidence is available to everyone: "The momentous reality of God stands there as peace, power and endless tranquility, as an inexhaustible source of help, as boundless compassion, as an open gate awaiting prayer." We under- stand how Heschel could face his nothingness, resolutely attack the presump- tion of his philosophical training, and let God live within. But, as Maurice Friedman has perceptively asked, what significance does Heschel's faith hold for those insensitive to his way of thinking, to those who cannot fathom his poetry, or for those who do not even yearn for faith?3o (Heschel assumes that an inherent, a priori sense of the sacred will stand free in all people after the fogs of doubt and intellectual arrogance are dis- pelled.)31 What significance does Heschel attribute to spiritual blindness and to the feeble responses to evil and suffering which accompany religious ob- tuseness? How could Heschel survive the insuperable contradictions between his mystical faith (represented by the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasi- dism) and his moral anguish (represented by Reb Mendel of Kotzk)? This was the personal dilemma to which he confessed in his final book, A Passion for Truth: "To live both in awe and consternation, in fervor and horror, with my conscience on mercy and my eyes on Auschwitz, wavering between exal- tation and dismay? Was this a life a man would choose to live? I had no choice: my heart was in Mezbizh [the home of the Baal Shem], my mind in Kotzk."32 A biblical insight helps explain why Heschel himself could not consider that contradiction final; it also elucidates his prophetic view of despair as a moment of self-discovery on the immense journey to God. This drastic way to bring back wanderers is explained in the chapter of The Prophets entitled 29 Not Alone, p. 282. 30 Professor Friedman defines the dilemma thus: "But the modern Jew's sense of the ineffable does not necessarily lead him to follow Heschel in prescriptions of the law as an objective order of divine will. ... He does not see the dilemma enough from within to build a bridge to Jewish law for most liberal Jews . .." (p. 78). The present paper approaches this complex problem, not from the perspective of the liberal Jew, but from that of the faithless. 31 In Man Is Not Alone he asserts that awe is "a fundamental norm of human consciousness, a categorical imperative. Indeed, the validity and requiredness of awe enjoy a degree of certainty that is not even surpassed by the axiomatic certainty of geometry" (p. 27). "We do, indeed, claim that meanings, just as facts, are independent of the structure of the human mind and given with or within things and events" (p. 28). This innate sense of ineffable meaning has many synonyms: it is "a forgotten mother tongue" (p. 75), "a dimension of all existence" (p. 64); "our inner life [is] an anonymous quotation" (p. 43), and many more. 32 Abraham Heschel, A Passion for Truth (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1973), p. xiv. 45</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion "Chastisement." Heschel asserts that hardness of heart, callousness-the root of all sin according to the Bible--can be the occasion of a return to God: "It seems that the only cure for willful hardness is to make it absolute. Half- callousness, paired with obstinate conceit, seeks no cure. When hardness is complete, it becomes despair, the end of conceit. Out of despair, out of total inability to believe, prayer bursts forth."33 Hopelessness can thus turn into a positive intuition of radical helplessness without God. Like Pascal, Heschel believed that confrontation with human misery would awaken a devouring hunger for meaning. Such is the common goal of Heschel's apologetics and of Pascal's Pensies. Conceit humiliated, pre- sumption quelled, the fragile and failing ego can then attain to the freedom of humility, to openness: "Agony is the final test. When all hopes are dashed and all conceit is shattered, man begins to miss what he has long spurned. In darkness, God becomes near and clear."34 Hardness of heart, resistance to God, is the opposite of freedom; in the biblical view guilt and punishment are one. Agony, radical despair, is the only cure for radical estrangement from the divine. A wise student has described this experience in these words: Despair, then, is a transition between two states of being. Since we are striving for some kind of all-inclusive meaning to our lives, the tension between the irreconcilable opposites of faith and meaninglessness challenges us. The tension, the distance felt, is despair. In despair we are neither here nor there; we are in the "wasteland, wil- derness, darkness." It is a state likened to death for we are separated, detached from an earlier fixed point, and we seem to pass through a realm that has none of the attributes of either state. We are "stripped of pretension and conceit" and humiliated by our "tragic insufficiency." We enter an abyss, a "spiritual blackout" of submissive apathy. We are lost, wandering, and blind. However, some of the basic principles of religious teaching-self-emptying humility and detachment-are obscurely present in this state. We are no longer surrounded by self-deception or self-love: the landscape of our soul is a desert, but it is not barren. We desperately cry for a hope that is beyond us, for we know that alone we cannot make that desert a fertile field. This submissive, disinterested self-denial, although excruciatingly painful, is the first step in the surren- der to God. It is the seed of salvation and can be a splendid moment according to Heschel.35 Our assent to Heschel's answer does not necessarily bind us to a rigid alternative of creed or despair. Somewhere between those two regions- amidst the faltering joy of faith and the bleak numbness of abandon-lies a 33 Abraham Heschel, The Prophets (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962), pp. 191-92. 34 Ibid., p. 193. On the same page, Heschel says, "When all pretensions are abandoned, one begins to feel the burden of guilt. It is easier to return from an extreme distance than from the complacency of a good conscience, from spurious proximity." 35 From a remarkable paper written by Mary Schenk (Mount Holyoke '76) for my course, Mysticism and the Moral Life, December 1975. 46</page><page sequence="15">Mysticism and Despair task, a vocation to which Heschel's prophetic mission gives voice: it is the redemption of humanity by itself.36 No waiting in stillness for the final Messi- ah; no surrender to absurd meaninglessness or chance. God may be silent or he may be Nothing. The divine may be essentially transcendent, concealed, or "God" may be a figment of our aspirations. Whatever the truth, Heschel defines a path to follow, one committed to the present and to the future. Empty or full, we respond to different moments of that vision. Only we can answer the challenge. Heschel's mysticism is an active wager that despair is the birth, not the grave, of a significant, and perhaps sacred, lifetime. 36 "According to the Kabbalah, redemption . . . is a continual process, taking place at every moment. Man's good deeds are single acts in the long drama of redemption, and not only the people of Israel, but the whole universe must be redeemed" (The Earth Is the Lord's, p. 72). 47</page></plain_text>
