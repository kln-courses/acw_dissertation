The word reaches us from The Prelude and the Third Critique: imagination?or its failure? reveals the mind's orientation toward a realm beyond nature. What Wordsworth names "Imagination?. . . the Power so called / Through sad incompetence of human speech," Kant (setting out, in the Critiques, the conditions for philosophical competence) names the Reason: a rad ically autonomous power of the mind disclosed when "the light of sense / Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed / The invisible world." That canonical example of the romantic sublime comes from the passage in Book vi of The Prelude where Wordsworth's recollection of his dis appointment at missing the moment at which he had crossed the Alps gives way to his representation of passing from a sensible to a suprasen sible faculty of mind, and to his affirmation that "our destiny, our being's heart and home, / Is with infinity, and only there."1 In Kant's terms, "nature is here called sublime merely because it elevates the imagination to a presentation of those cases in which the mind can make felt the proper sublimity of its destination, in comparison with nature itself."2 The aesthetic judgment "this is sublime," through registering the inadequacy of aesthetic comprehension ("Zusammenfas sung," "comprehensio aesthetica"), discloses the necessary existence of a suprasensible faculty alone capable of thinking an absolute might or magnitude: the faculty of reason, which is the capacity for ethical judg ment.

The aesthetic is crucial because aesthetic judg ment represents the possibility of judgment in general, of crossing from perception to cognition and from intuition to the exercise of the reason. "The continuity of aesthetic with rational judgment," then?"the main tenet and crux of all critical philosophies and 'Romantic' literatures"3? is the bearing of that affirmation of the power of Imagination that we habitually call romantic. What this implies for rational judgment or for the category of the aesthetic gets intimated in Wordsworth's lines ("the light of sense goes out . . ."). But it may be read out more exhaustively in texts at some remove from The Prelude and The Critique of Judgment, texts which can be read as undertaking to answer the question posed by Kant's and Wordsworth's affirmation. That question, in Hegel's terms, is, How does the idea make its appearance in the world? The question gets answered in various ways in the Aesthetics and the Phenomenology, as well as in the very organization of the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, where it is once again art that gets situated at the crucial junction between politics and philosophy, between practical and pure reason, the crossing, in Hegel's terms, from the objective to the absolute spirit. Suppose we look up the answer in the Encyclopedia.4 It's easy to locate there and it quickly reveals an unexpected factor. What we are looking for is what leads up to the emergence of "thought," Denken. For the idea makes its appearance in the world through the action ofthe "intelligence" or "Theoretical Mind," which culminates in "intelligence that comprehends the concrete universal nature of objects, or thought in the specific sense that what we think also is."5 Thought in this specific sense is led up to, not surprisingly, by "Intui tion" (Anschauung) followed by "Representation" (Darstellung), the cen tral moment of which?the middle of the middle term?is, again not surprisingly, "Imagination." What is surprising is the alignments on 3. Paul de Man, "Hegel on the Sublime," Messenger Lecture at Cornell University, March 1983. 4.

For this crucial junction is designated "Memory," Gedachtnis. Not recollection, not remembrance, not Erinnerung: that inwardizing of the object, which we habitually associate with the transformative power of art, comes "before" "Imagination," in Hegel's scheme here. Erinnerung is the first moment of "Representation," followed by "Imagination"; the third de cisive moment is Gedachtnis, memory in the sense of memorization, which constitutes the passage into thought, Hegel explains, because it has to do with signs alone. The idea makes its appearance in the world as memorized signs. Not, then, as art: not then as symbols of what is remembered, works of art in the symbolical conception of art that predominates in the Aesthetics. The object of aesthetic judgment which is the work of art as symbol constitutes the remembrance or Erinnerung of the phenomenal world it represents as meaningful. But to be thought, according to the Encyclo pedia, the inwardized objects of the imagination must materialize as signs: as memorizations or inscriptions. The question arises whether that is what the aesthetic must be construed to be. The strictly arbitrary relation between the sign's own shape or sound (its "intuition," "irgend eine unmittelbare Anschauung," par. 458) and its meaning distinguishes the sign from the symbol, where shape or "intuition" and meaning substantially and conceptually coincide. In signs, the mind frees itself from images and makes use of the perceived world for its own purposes, reducing it to a minimal materiality whose significance is not intrinsic but stricdy designatory. It is in this sense that the mind shows itself freer and more powerful in using signs than in using symbols; "Als bezeichnend beweist daher die Intelligenz eine freiere Willkiir und Herrschaft im Gebrauch der Anschauung, denn als symbolisierend" (Par. 458). The Encyclopedia account gives a different inflection to the notion of the creative power of the imagination familiar from The Prelude and the Third Critique. Prominent in Kant's and Words worth's reflections is an analogy between the creative power of the imagination and that of nature. We find this analogy reformulated, in thoroughly classic terms?as a comparison between the generative ac tivity of the sun and of the poet?in a text we will read together with Hegel's, Baudelaire's poem "Le Soleil" (second of the "Tableaux Pari siens"). The topos of "Le Soleil" implies that the idea makes its appear ance in the world by way of the creative power of the genius?one Kantian answer to the question of the aesthetic. But just as Hegel's Encyclopedia account stresses that the power of the imagination is that of "the imagination which creates signs," Baudelaire's "Tableau" shows</page><page sequence="4">244 CYNTHIA CHASE how the elaboration of the Kantian analogy entails the description of the power to generate signs rather than works of art or nature.6 What we shall trace, then, is how far Baudelaire's and Hegel's texts make the same response to the same question (How does the idea make its ap pearance in the world?). Both the passage in the Encyclopedia and the poem in Les Fleurs du mal meet our question of whether the crossing between thought and imagination, between the philosophical and the aesthetic, is a passage from one to the other: whether it is a passage between two passages of the same order, or a passage, a crossing, from one order to another. Wordsworth's celebrated crossing poses this ques tion as much as Kant's affirmed connection. For the decisive crossing there is not the crossing of the Alps, but the passage between that crossing and the next, where the mind crosses over from the world of sense to the thought of infinity. And that passage is not a passage but a blank, the space signifying the difference between two verse paragraphs, the distance?of what order??between two clusters of signs. Beginning then with the Encyclopedia: What are the consequences ofthe central role of "the imagination which creates signs," of "Zeichen mach ende Phantasie"? Recognizing in "sich aussernd, Anschauung produzierend?Zeichen machende Phantasie" the faculty that Wordsworth hails as Imagination can enable us to understand why Hegel calls it "memory." With the access of "the Power so called / Through sad incompetence of human speech (The Prelude vi, 592-93), images are effaced, "the light of sense goes out"; and this access of Power occurs at the moment at which the mind confronts the signs it has produced: "the time, / When to myself it fairly might be said . . . / 'The threshold now is overpast'" (writes Wordsworth of entering London in the 1805 Prelude, vm, 697-99); the moment at which the mind confronts its "translation" of verbal utter ance, as Wordsworth writes: "every word that from the peasant's lips / came in reply, translated by our feelings, / Ended in this,?that we had crossed the Alps" (vi, 589-91). The Imagination's production of signs is a confrontation of signs. For the sign, as such, does not say what it means, or mean what it says, but points to a meaning that must always imply the possibility of its designation by another subject. What the "Zeichen machende Phantasie" creates is a citation. 6. On how Kant's own elaboration of the analogy describes the power to generate signs and specifically commodities, see Richard Klein, "Kant's Sunshine," Diacritics 11:2 (Sum mer 1981), 26-41.</page><page sequence="5">READING HEGEL WITH BAUDELAIRE 245 It thus gets defined, by Hegel, as "memory": "Diese Zeichen erschaf fende Tatigkeit kann das produktive Gedachtnis (die zunachst abstrakte Mnemosyne) vornehmlich genannt werden, indem das Gedachtnis . . . es iiberhaupt nur mit Zeichen zu tun hat" (Par. 458). Memory is "pro ductive," Hegel writes here, insofar as it has to do strictly with signs. This is the distinction not only between Gedachtnis and Einbildungskraft, but also, so it would appear, between Gedachtnis and Mnemonik, true memory and the ancient mnemonic technique ("Mnemonik der Alten," Par. 462) of associating ideas with images or pictures. Gedachtnis is superior to Mnemonik just because it no longer has to do with the image (Bild), "welches aus dem unmittelbaren, ungeistigen Bestimmtsein der Intelligenz, aus der Anschauung, hergenommen ist," but with a product of intelligence itself: "mit einem Dasein, welches das Produkt der Intel ligenz selbst ist," namely the sign. Hegel's account indicates that in its sign-producing function the mind has no longer to do with images, and that the "well" of the ego is left behind. Though it is virtually impossible not to take one's bearings by the intimations, in this text, of an itinerary of the mind's object, of a progression from perception to thought, one would misread it in ac cording that orientation any more than heuristic value. The exclusive preeminence of the sign may seem to appear as the culmination of a smooth progression from intuition or conception to imagination to thought, which would also be a progression in intelligence. But a reading along these lines would miss the significance of Hegel's distinctive conjunction of Denken with Gedachtnis. This emerges as we enter into the complexities of the Encyclopedia account of thought and language: the introduction of another term, "names"?"Wir denken in Namen," Hegel declares?and an account of the language of "names" which draws a distinction between alphabetic writing and hieroglyphics. Because language, in Hegel's terms, consists in names?"fur sich sinn lose Ausserlichkeiten die erst als Zeichen eine Bedeutung haben" (Par. 459&gt; 393), highly susceptible of being forgotten, hence requiring to be written down?the discussion of language (in Par. 459) promptly be comes a discussion of writing. This has disruptive consequences in Hegel's argument. Reading, in Hegel's account, has undesirable and disturbing implications. The mind becomes dependent for thought on marks "external to the living mind" (The Prelude vm, 551), on material inscriptions. An account of the far reaching consequences of writing and reading underlies and undermines the distinctions between alphabetic and hieroglyphic writing, and the parallel distinction between memory and Mnemonik, that give this sec tion its shape. In the pressure of the semiotic analysis, the shaping</page><page sequence="6">246 CYNTHIA CHASE distinctions ofthe passage break down. Thus since the images associated with ideas in mnemonic technique are linked with them arbitrarily, as Hegel specifies, they actually constitute signs, or an unwritten hiero glyphics, which are, as Hegel says, read off, "abgelesen" (Par. 462, 403). As the reading off of ideas from images, mnemonics should stand at the opposite extreme from the intelligence that presents itself in the articulation of ideas in words; it is not intelligent, but silly: the ideas to be remembered are linked with images "durch schale, alberne, ganz zufallige Zusammenhange" (Par. 462, 403). Yet it would strain Hegel's account of language unmanageably to argue that the links between ideas and words are any less shallow and arbitrary. It would involve?a tack the argument does take, momentarily?an emphasis on the "bewusstlo sen dumpfen Anfange" of language, its natural rather than accidental origin out of an "inner symbolism" of "posture" (Par. 497, 397). This speculation gets abandoned promptly. It is clearly not a practicable way to maintain the desirable distinction between memory and Mnemonik, since it is incompatible with Hegel's premise that language is designa tory, not symbolic. Nor does "posture" leave much range for either articulation or intelligence. The distinction between hieroglyphics and a "more intelligent" pho netic writing turns out to be just as impossible to sustain. Alphabetic writing is said to be more "intelligent" than hieroglyphic writing because it directs the mind to reflection upon the word: "in ihr ist das Wort, die der Intelligenz eigentumlichste wiirdigste Art der Ausserung ihrer Vor stellung, zum Bewusstsein gebracht, zum Gegenstande der Reflexion gemacht" (Par. 459, p. 399). In practice, however, this "reflection" is simply the transcription or the deciphering of names. With practice, alphabetic writing and phonetic reading become hieroglyphic. Articu lation and reflection both succumb to habit: Die erlangte Gewohnheit tilgt auch spater die Eigentumlichkeit der Buchstabenschrift, im Interesse des Sehens als ein Umweg durch die Horbarkeit zu den Vorstellungen zu erscheinen, und macht sie fur uns zur Hieroglyphenschrift, so dass wir beim Gebrauche der selben die Vermittlung der Tone nicht im Bewusstsein vor uns zu haben bediirfen; Leute dagegen, die eine geringe Gewohnheit des Lesens haben, sprechen das Gelesene laut vor, um es in seinem Tonen zu verstehen. (Par. 459, 401) Practiced, competent reproduction of alphabetic language is mute; "das hieroglyphische Lesen [ist] fur sich selbst ein taubes Lesen und ein stummes Schreiben." Since audibility has been identified as the very intelligibility ofthe sign as such as it exists in time (Par. 459, 396), and</page><page sequence="7">READING HEGEL WITH BAUDELAIRE 247 intelligence defined as speaking and hearing oneself speak (Par. 459, 401), this means that the outcome of the institution of Tonsprache, the practice of writing and reading, represents the elision of the intelligible sign and of intelligence. Yet no alternative to this outcome appears possible or acceptable. The alternative to practiced reading, for example, is not intelligent speech, but mere enunciation?the painstaking reading off of sounds in an at tempt to recognize their signification. The articulation of words in this case constitutes as wasteful a detour from the idea designated hieroglyph ically in the written sign as the detour through images in Mnemonik from the idea designated in its name. Words must become mute hieroglyphs either because they represent so little?as sheer names, externalities significant only as signs?or be cause they designate so much. In the one passage in these sections that describes an effect in a way that evokes a historical chronology, Hegel describes how alphabetic language has come to resemble hieroglyphics because "names" have taken on the character of "definitions." In modern times, Hegel writes, things designated in the sciences, for example chemistry and mineralogy, acquire new definitions; muriatic acid ('Salz saure") has frequently changed its name. Definitions, like hieroglyphic characters, are produced through the decomposition of an idea into its supposed characteristics, and must change whenever those suppositions change. Seitdem man vergessen hat was Namen als solche sind, namlich fur sich sinnlose Ausserlichkeiten, die erst als Zeichen eine Bedeutung haben, seit man statt eigentilicher Namen den Ausdruck einer Art von Definition fordert und dieselbe sogar haufig auch wieder nach Willkiir and Zufall formiert, andert sich die Benennung, die ist nur die Zusammensetzung aus Zeichen ihrer Gattungsbestimmung oder anderer charakteristisch sein sollender Eigenschaften, nach der Ver schiedenheit der Ansicht, die man von der Gattung oder sonst einer spezifisch sein sollender Eigenschaft fasst. (Par. 459, 398-99) Once the nature of names as signs has been forgotten, "Willkiir" and "Zufall" conspire in producing the "denomination" ("Benennung") of an idea, rather than a simple name. Yet these are the very terms, of course, that characterize the mind's use of signs ("Willkiir" [Par. 458] accompanies the arbitrary, accidental link between the "intuition" and the signification of the sign). Thus the forgetting of the nature of names as signs makes them truly function as signs. In doing so, they lose the durability that was supposed to be their privilege, according to the contrast drawn between alphabetic writing</page><page sequence="8">248 CYNTHIA CHASE and hieroglyphic writing. Hieroglyphic writing lacks the precision and resiliency ascribed to articulated language. Since it represents not the signs of speech but ideas, it is perilously brittle and vague; it has all the instability of the ideas it represents; it must change as the analysis of ideas changes, and it lends no definite outlines to the spoken language, to the spoken signs to which hieroglyphs do not refer. A hieroglyphic writing can only endure where philosophy remains as static as the civilization ofthe Chinese (Par. 459, 401), and only among that minute portion of the population able to practice the decomposition of ideas that it entails (Par. 459, 399). Alphabetic writing is required for com merce; "Man darf. . . halten, dass der Verkehr der Volker (was vielleicht in Phonizien der Fall war und gegenwartig in Kanton geschieht . . . ) . . . das Bediirfnis der Buchstabenschrift und deren Entstehung herbei gefuhrt hat" (Par. 459, 398). Alphabetic, not hieroglyphic writing, is valuable for Bildung, suited to the process of education: "Lesen und Schreiben-lernen einer Buchstabenschrift fur ein nicht genug geschatztes, unendliches Bildungsmittel zu halten ist" (Par. 459, 401). Yet not only has Hegel described the outcome of education, the process of learning to read and write an alphabetic script, as "hiero glyphic" reading, "a deaf reading and a mute writing." He has also described a historical mutation of alphabetic language into a language of hieroglyphic "definitions." The language of names as such, that is, is radically mutable. As hieroglyphics, it has to bear the burden of history, "the weight of ages," and it does not remain intact. For not only does its nature as names succumb to forgetting, but its nature as articulation and as reflection gives way with habit, with practice. Thus Hegel refers approvingly to "that parler sans accent which in Europe is justly required of an educated speaker" (Par. 459)?an erosion of the sensory shapes of signs, that is, such as he decries in the brittle fragility of hieroglyphic writing. The ostensible contrast between alphabetic and hieroglyphic writing gets disqualified by the more insistent and insidious logic of Hegel's semiotic analysis of the language of names, whereby we find that language signifies precisely insofar as it has the effects and qualities of hieroglyphics. For how does the mind retain names? Thought depends on this ability: on "das Namen behaltende Gedachtnis"?on memory, on Gedachtnis, "to which German language gives the high position of immediate rela tionship with thought" ("unmittelbaren Verwandtschaft mit dem Ge danken," Par. 464). The supreme achievement ofthe power of memo rization is the ability to recite lists of meaningless words, for example, lists of proper names. Lists of names must be recited without any accentuation preserving awareness of their meaning, for that would disrupt the memorization process:</page><page sequence="9">READING HEGEL WITH BAUDELAIRE 249 Man weiss bekanntlich einen Aufsatz erst dan recht auswendig, wenn man keinen Sinn bei den Worten hat; das Hersagen solches Auswendiggewussten wird darum von selbst accentlos. Der richtige Accent der hineingebracht wird, geht auf den Sinn; die Bedeutung, Vorstellung, die herbeigerufen wird, stort dagegen den mechan ischen Zusammenhang und verwirrt daher leicht das Hersagen. Das Vermogen, Reihen von Worten, in deren Zusammenhang kein Ver stand ist, oder die schon fur sich sinnlos sind (eine Reihe von Eigennamen), auswendig behalten zu konnen ist darum so hochst wunderbar, weil der Geist wesentlich dies ist, bei sich selbst zu sein, hier aber derselbe als in ihm selbst entaussert, seine Tatigkeit als ein Mechanismus ist. (Par. 463, 404) In reciting from memory one has to suppress reflection and allow the mind to function like a machine. The machine neither reflects nor artic ulates; it retains neither the sensory shapes of names nor their meaning. Yet "memory" in this sense is the very passage into thought; "Gedacht nis ist auf diese Weise der Ubergang in die Tatigkeit des Gedankens" (Par. 463, 414). Hegel dismisses as delusory "the common prepossession about memory, in comparison with fancy and imagination, as if the latter were a higher and more intellectual activity than memory." Mem ory is superior because it "has ceased to deal with an image derived from intuition" (Par. 462). For Hegel the idea makes its appearance in the world not with representation or imagination in any generous sense, and not with the work of art, which maintains its sensory shape and recalls its inner meaning, as Erinnerung, but strictly as Gedachtnis, with the sequence of signs that commemorate just insofar as they neither resonate nor remember, and so can exist auswendig: as lists learned by rote, inscriptions by a mind that functions like a writing machine. The memory of history, in particular, consists in this recital of lists of proper names, this activity whereby the minimal material traces of names are produced in a rigid yet arbitrary sequence by a process spec ified to be absolutely incompatible with reflection or self-consciousness. Memorization is identified with a strictly necessary and strictly contin gent sequence which has nothing in common with the realm of inten tions and purposes, the teleological order of thought and representation; yet it is deemed the prerequisite for?the passage into?thought. One can hardly claim to point to consequences of an aporia as intran sigent as this one. Hegel's further remarks on Gedachtnis barely sketch the ramifications for history, in particular, of the drastic collision entailed in the collusion of memory and thought. The continuity of culture from one generation to the next?as well as the continuity from one thought to another in one mind? is problematical, since (Hegel comments) the</page><page sequence="10">250 CYNTHIA CHASE young have better memories than the old. The old, who have lived things to remember, have a poor memory, whereas the young have a good memory just because they are not yet capable of experience or reflection ("weil sie sich noch nicht nachdenkend verhalt" [Par. 464, 405]). The young do not choose what to memorize, neither on the basis of value judgments nor even on grounds of utility; "ihr Gedachtnis wird nicht nur um der Nutzlichkeit willen geiibt; sondern . . . es wird absichtlich oder unabsichtlich darum geiibt, um den Boden ihrer Inner lichkeit zum reinen Sein, zum reinen Raume zu ebnen" (Par. 464, 405). Memory is exercised so as to level the ground of the inner self to an empty space. This passage in Hegel's account calls up images of a world of forgetful old people and automaton-like young, of a "mumbling sire"7 confronting a chanting youth. Such a youth devoted to rote learning bizarrely resembles the revo lutionary whose existence is hinted at toward the close of an essay of Walter Benjamin's which sets out from a critical premise comparable to Hegel's: a rejection ofthe usual assumption that violence is to be thought of and justified simply as a means. Hegel's account of memory rejects the same assumption about memorization. Memory is the passage into the activity of thought, for Hegel, where it is simply exercised, not subordinated to a use or a function ("um der Nutzlichkeit willen geiibt"). Benjamin's "Critique of Violence"8 reverses the usual assumption whereby violence is considered to be justified, perhaps, if it is ultimately in the service of law, to conclude that to the contrary, law itself repre sents intolerable violence and only the nonmediate function of violence is susceptible of justification. The sheer exercise of memory, by the young?rather than its use?affects subjectivity like the "annihilating violence" evoked by Benjamin. The "Critique of Violence" is painfully attentive to the ambiguity that comes to the fore in Hegel's text as memory is accorded the crucial role in the achievement of thought, which the next section in the Encyclopedia identifies with "Will." A prime instance of nonmediate violence is "mythical violence," which establishes boundaries or frontiers (between the divine and the human), and thereby stands as the basis ofthe insti tution of law itself. The example of such "mythical violence" is Apollo's destruction of Niobe's children, leaving the mother intact (that "bitter desolation, where the order of things is disturbed and inverted" whose 7.

It must be banished to ban the suspicion that the mythical conception of an "order of things" actually requires such an inversion? as when inscriptions impress themselves on the mind, which becomes a tombstone, or a "Tableau," or a reciting machine, through the re quirements of the very structure of the sign, or "name." The funda mental identity between "the mythical manifestation of immediate vio lence" and "all legal violence" both makes the "destruction" of the law (as violence) "obligatory,"10 and erases the distinction between the vio lence of means, and pure nonmediate violence, on which the distinction between the law and the destruction of the law depends. The difficulty is the same as one encounters in Hegel's account in comparing the activity of the intelligence in producing signs with its activity in memorization. For "intelligence" must reside both in the use of signs and in the exercise of memory, as Hegel writes, not for its utility. In dealing with things as signs, the mind uses them as its own property; it uses their natural properties for its own purposes, effacing their natural connotations and replacing them with properties of meaning of its own. The mind does violence to natural properties in establishing the law of the sign, in enforcing the laws of signification. But to deal with signs is to deal with names, and to retain names, the mind must inscribe or memorize them. The mediate violence of signification becomes the nonmediate violence of memorization ("leveling" the subject). While Benjamin's essay seems to pose the problem as an ethical and practical one, Hegel's text poses it as an interpretive dilemma regarding the status of "intelligence" and of linguistic activity. For Hegel's analysis reveals that the activity of signification is both merely (violently) purposive, mediate, and nonmediate, an effacement of purposes, and as vulnerable (not only in forgetting, but in the erosion of accent required in recitation) as the mere natural properties of things. Since these conditions cannot be thought as existing simultaneously, the text has to evoke a certain itinerary, or rather offer a narrative, and has to give the activity of signification different names?"Phantasie" and "Gedachtnis"?even as the distinction between them erodes through further discriminations or "definitions": "Zeichen machende Phantasie" (Par. 457), "Diese Zeichen erschaffende Tatigkeit. . . das produktive Gedachtnis" (Par. 461), "Das reproduzierende Gedachtnis" (Par. 462), "mechanische Gedachtnis" (Par. 457, 463, 464). 9.

So does the text's explicit statement about the impact of "intelligence." Its "consummated appro priation" of names as signs "abolishes the distinction between meaning and name." The structure of the sign construed as a passage from meaning to sign or from sign to meaning is here said to collapse in the very activity by which signs are treated as such. The mind, as well as the sign, is collapsed or compressed, emptied and flattened out, according to Hegel's description of the activity in which "intelligence" culminates. The mind becomes simply the space retaining names in order, an "empty link" between a name and a mean ing, or?indistinguishably?between one name and the next: "Ich . . . ist . . . die Macht des verschiedenen Namen, das leere Band, welches Reihen derselben in sich befestigt und in fester Ordnung behalt" (Par. 463, 404). The memorizing I is an empty link or an empty volume (Band). And the object of memorization is "ein Auswendiges," "a with out-book" (Par. 462). We can understand this to mean that the object of memorization is rote learning, without-book knowledge of names. But we should also see how these definitions virtually dissolve the distinction between the mind and its products. That distinction would appear to be vital to the Kantian analogy between nature and the genius, where it is nature's productive power, not nature as product, which the genius resembles and reproduces. Yet when Baudelaire's verses elaborate this analogy they show us something like what we infer in Hegel's text: the I runs into its products. Quand le soleil cruel frappe a traits redoubles Sur la ville et les champs, sur les toits et les bles, Je vais m'exercer seul a ma fantasque escrime, Flairant dans tous les coins les hasards de la rime, Trebuchant sur les mots comme sur les paves, Heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps reves. (11. 3-8)11 The rest of the poem describes the actions not of the poet but of the aggressive imperial sun. Baudelaire's stanzas offer a more pictorial nar rative than Hegel's paragraphs, but the picture is a puzzle. What does the action of the I have to do with the sun?

The first stanza of "Le Soleil" revises the Kantian analogy between Nature and the genius by posing a metonymical rather than a meta phorical relation between the actions of the sun and of the poet. It is "when" the sun strikes that the poet goes out to engage, "alone," in his fantastical fencing. This metonymy replaces a relationship of resem blance between the two actions with one of simultaneity or juxtaposi tion. For if fencing in some respect resembles the action of striking, or of striking "a traits redoubles," the one action does not meet or respond to the other. The sun and the poet in "Le Soleil" are not mutual antag onists, as Nature and the artist are characterized at the conclusion of "Le confiteor de l'artiste": "Nature, enchanteresse sans pitie, rivale toujours victorieuse, laisse-moi! . . . L'etude du beau est un duel ou l'artiste crie de frayeur avant d'etre vaincu."12 Benjamin describes the poet of "Le Soleil" parrying shocks with consciousness.13 But what the poem de scribes in the first instance is the action not of parrying the sun's blows, or striking back, but of striking up against things?words, paving stones, and verses. If in the duel of "Le confiteor" the artist is no match for Nature, the fantastical fencing of "Le Soleil" is no match at all: the poet's gestures coincide (occur at the same time as) the sun's blows without meeting them; he collides, instead, with his own effects. Just this happens to the mind engaged in memorization, according to Hegel. The faculty of memory is marvelous ("wunderbar") because it is in the nature of mind to be "bei sich," "to have its wits about it," 12. op cit., p. 149. 13. Benjamin, "Uber einige Motive bei Baudelaire," Gesammelte Schrifien, Werkausgabe Band i.ii, 605-55; translated as "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," Illuminations (New York: Schocken, 1969), pp. 155-200. Benjamin's reference to the opening stanza of "Le Soleil" follows a section of his essay that sets out from Freud's dictum in Beyond the Pleasure Principle?that within the same system, memory and consciousness are incompatible?to distinguish two different modes of disjunction between them: Proust's memoire involontaire, a kind of recollection possible only of what has not been consciously experienced, and Baudelaire's shock-defense, a mode of consciousness which prevents an impression's penetration into memory as trauma. The involuntary character of Proustian memory? not a process the subject can deliberately activate, nor a dependable compensation for the failure of conscious appropriation?differentiates it decisively from Hegel's Erinnerung. The preeminence of consciousness instead of memory which Benjamin ascribes to Bau delaire does, however, in some respects resemble Hegel's Gedachtnis?both when it fails (and what takes effect is shock) and when it succeeds: That achievement, writes Benjamin, entails "assigning to an incident a precise point in time in consciousness at the cost of the integrity of its contents" ( Illuminations, p. 163; GS i.ii, 615).</page><page sequence="14">254 CYNTHIA CHASE Wallace translates; whereas in the exercise of memory (Gedachtnis), the mind comes upon its own products as if with surprise, encountering "its own" as something "picked up": Der Geist aber ist nur bei sich als Einheit der Subjektivitat und der Objektivitat; und hier im Gedachtnis, nachdem er in der An schauung zunachst als Ausserliches so ist, dass er die Bestimmungen findet, und in der Vorstellung dieses Gefundene in sich erinnert und es zu dem Seinigen macht, macht er sich als Gedachtnis in ihm selbst zu einem Ausserlichen, so dass das Seinige als ein Gefunden werdendes erscheint. (Par. 463) Such "memory" is the state of mind of the poet of "Le Soleil," "heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps reves." It characterizes the I from the outset of its itinerary, in Baudelaire's tableau, if not in Hegel's apparently narrative rendering of the mind's alienation as it approaches thought (Denken, reached "after" Gedachtnis, which is reached "after" Anschauung and Vorstellung, "intuition" and "representation"). We can do without the details; Baudelaire gives us the picture. If we take another angle on the Encyclopedia the two accounts match up better: in the hierarchy implied by the contrast between the resistless power of the sun and the resistance met with by the poet we can recognize the distinction between "Intelligenz" and "Gedachtnis," or between "Zeichen machende Phan tasie" and "das reproduktive Gedachtnis." We are engaged first of all by the poem's picturing of the poet's activity. The opening stanza of "Le Soleil" pictures the kind of "mem ory" that Hegel's paragraphs describe. But the effect of Baudelaire's picture of the poet at work is promptly to engage us in a nonrepresen tational reading, in a rhetorical analysis of the poem's syntactical ele ments. For the first stanza represents the subject of the poem as caught up not in the activity of representation but rather in a dreamwork-like engagement with words as signifiers?"Flairant dans tous les coins les hasards de la rime . . . / Heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps reves" (11. 6, 9). The stanza's narrative dimension, moreover, has to do not with the poet representing himself walking, but rather with the syntactical process indicated in the present participles stressed by their initial position in the stanza's three final lines ("Flairant. . . / Trebuchant . . . / Heurtant . . . /") and in the temporal coincidence, situating the poet's fencing in the same moment as the sun's striking, stressed by the initial "Quand" (1. 3).14 14- Cf. Benjamin on "the special achievement of shock defense," quoted in note 13, above.</page><page sequence="15">READING HEGEL WITH BAUDELAIRE 255 These features of what Benjamin calls the "portraiture" in the poem's first stanza15 mean that what looked as if it would look like the Kantian resemblance between the creative powers of the genius and of Nature has to be read instead as the repetition with a difference of the activity of signification variously named by Hegel: the mind making, aligning, running into, signs. On this it's the poem rather than the Encyclopedia that gives us the details. The first stanza inscribes the relationship be tween the poet and the sun as a metonymy instead of a metaphor. The second stanza inscribes relationships between mental and material objects and between ugly and beautiful, or urban and pastoral ones? as neither metaphors nor metonymies. In its second stanza "Le Soleil" breaks down the difference between comparing objects and juxtaposing objects, be tween metaphor and metonymy, to display a power of signification exceeding the play of tropes. Like memorization, it is the power to assemble lists. Baudelaire's verses assemble lists of objects that could be compared and objects that could be juxtaposed: the poem couples "mots" with "paves," "rimes" with "coins," and "cerveaux" with "ruches"?objects of two different orders, which might be related by similarity, or metaphor; but also "les toits et les bles," "la ville et les champs," "les vers et les roses"?objects of different appeal but ofthe same order, related by contiguity, or metonymy. In fact, in Baudelaire's verses, these designated items are linked to one another by neither resemblance nor proximity. "Le Soleil" does without those articulations as the mind in memorization forgets the meanings linking the words it 15- Benjamin's account of "Le Soleil" seemingly calls attention to its representational and autobiographical aspect: "In soldi phantastischem Gefecht begriffen, hat Baudelaire sich selbst in der Anfangsstrophe des Gedichts 'Le soleil' portratiert; und dass ist wohl die einzige Stelle der 'Fleurs du mal,' die ihn bei der poetischen Arbeit zeigt" (GS i.i, 616). But this portraiture is not pictorial but rather (in all senses) graphic: it depicts not the scene of Baudelaire's walks through the city, but rather the "Intermittenzen zwischen Bild und Idee, Wort und Sache, in denen die poetische Erregung bei Baudelaire ihren eigen tlichen Sitz vorfinde." (Illuminations, p. 164; GS i.i, 617). Baudelaire's graphic depiction of the experience of shock (as a "combat"?"ma fantasque escrime") registers, for Ben jamin, his contact with the crowd; the crowd, a part of Baudelaire's experience, is significant precisely insofar as it neither appears nor means itself, as such, in Baudelaire's writing: "Diese Menge, deren Dasein Baudelaire nie vergisst, hat ihm zu keinem seiner Werke Modell gestanden. Sie ist aber seinem Schaffen als verborgene Figur eingepragt . . . Das Bild des Fechters lasst sich aus ihr entziffern; die Stosse, welche er austeilt, sind bestimmt, ihm durch die Menge den Weg zu bahnen. Freilich sind die faubourgs, durch die der Dichter des 'Soleil' sich hindurchschlagt, menschenleer. Aber die geheime Kon stellation (in ihr wird die Schonheit der Strophe bis auf den Grund durchsichtig) ist wohl so zu fassen: es ist die Geistermenge der Worte, der Fragmente, der Versanfange, mit denen der Dichter in den verlassenen Strassenziigen den Kampf um die poetische Beute ausficht (Illuminations, p. 165; GS i.ii, 618).</page><page sequence="16">256 CYNTHIA CHASE cites. This is what it is, Baudelaire shows us, Hegel tells us, to get versed. The items designated in "Le Soleil" are linked by three terms? "comme," "et," and "ainsi que"?each of which is employed in such a way as to imply the other two. Comme, which could indicate substantial likeness, and et, which could indicate mere juxtaposition, both invariably imply "ainsi que": something acts, or is acted upon, "like" something else. Both where it links physical and mental objects, typically a meta phorical move, and where it links physical with other physical objects, typically a metonymy, "comme" also means et: Trebuchant les mots comme sur les paves, Eveille dans les champs les vers comme les roses; (U. 7, io) It's not that words are like pavingstones, but that "I" trips on them as he also trips on pavingstones; and not that worms (or verses) are like roses, but that the sun awakens them both alike. Moreover, "et" also means "comme," or "ainsi que," and this represents an intolerable sit uation, in which the sun treats unlike things alike: Quand le soleil cruel frappe a traits redoubles Sur la ville et les champs, sur les toits et les bles, II fait s'evaporer les soucis vers le ciel, Et remplit les cerveaux et les ruches de miel. (11. 3-4, 11-12) The sun fills brains and hives with honey just as it strikes with redoubled blows the city and the country. Under its impact, the difference between a mental and a material object, brains and hives, is no greater than?no different than?the difference between an urban and a pastoral object, between "La ville et les champs, les toits et les bles." One could be cheered by the prospect of the sun filling the brain with "honey," or filling the hive with honey, but not with the assertion of both at once. Either the brain is being filled with syrup, or the hive is being filled with thoughts, or both; this sun brings not a double plenitude but a stupefied fasting, the condition of a "mangeur d'opium." The indeter minably literal or figurative "honey" of these verses represents nothing so much as the bland saccharine connective et that sticks together the disparate terms of these pairs. "Le Soleil" can name a thing like another unlike thing?and make it stick. The resistless and indiscriminate activity of "le soleil" is the power of the mind in using signs, rather than symbols, celebrated in the Encyclo</page><page sequence="17">READING HEGEL WITH BAUDELAIRE 257 pedia. It makes the natural properties of things its own property, and instead of treating them as inherently significant, fills them with a significance which is only unpredictably related to their perceptual or phenomenal properties. Anything can be treated as a sign?natural ob jects, images, as well as mental objects, words, for example, which in memory, or in writing, become the signs of signs (not of things). In Hegel's text and in Baudelaire's, representation is represented as the activity of producing signs which Hegel also calls Gedachtnis. Thus Hegel's opening paragraph on Gedachtnis (Par. 461) explains it as an inwardizing ofthe word that occurs through the same activity as the inwardizing of the intuition that takes place in representation in general: Die Intelligenz durchlauft als Gedachtnis gegen die Anschauung des Worts dieselben Tatigkeiten des Erinnerns, wie als Vorstellung (iberhaupt gegen die erste unmittelbare Anschauung. (Par. 461, 402) Gedachtnis does not pass beyond Erinnerung. This sentence makes Erinnern connote not remembrance or recollection, but inclusion in "das leere Band" that makes names of things. The process that intelligence goes through ("durchlauft") is not a progression (or a regression) but a rep etition. What Hegel calls "die Intelligenz" operates on natural images as?"ainsi que"?it operates on words. "Le Soleil," in Baudelaire's poem, is not simply the power of figurative language which subsumes the functions of metaphor and metonymy?language as representation? but language that exceeds a representational function. These "et" and "comme" do not picture a process; they give us the picture: they perform a judgment. "Le Soleil" destroys the distinction between natural and mental ob jects, in treating them alike. Yet at the same time it maintains the difference between them: the poem conspicuously differentiates between two kinds of objects even as it describes them acted upon in the same way. Filling things with significance instead of treating them as inher ently meaningful, "ce pere nourricier" makes use of things' natural properties, but carries out a function independent of utility: "[II] com mande aux moissons de croitre et de murir / Dans le coeur immortel qui toujours veut fleurir." Means and end coincide in this activity, which is described by Benjamin in his "Critique of Violence" as the identity between lawmaking violence and nonmediate violence.16 What is estab lished here through the "empty link" between objects or properties of different orders (the link which is indiscriminately "comme," "et," or "ainsi que") is the law of signification. "Le soleil cruel frappe a traits redoubles"; "Lawmaking," writes Benjamin, "is power making, and, to 16. Benjamin, Reflections, p. 295.</page><page sequence="18">258 CYNTHIA CHASE that extent, an immediate manifestation of violence." Its "primal phe nomenon," like that of all "lawmaking violence," according to Benja min, is "the establishing of frontiers": Where frontiers are decided the adversary is not simply annihilated; indeed, he is accorded rights even when the victor's superiority in power is complete. And these are, in a demonically ambiguous way, "equal" rights: for both parties to the treaty it is the same line that may not be crossed. Here appears . . . the same mythical ambiguity of laws to which Anatole France refers satirically when he says, "Poor and rich are equally forbidden to spend the night under bridges." . . . From the point of view of violence, which alone can guarantee law, there is no equality, but at the most equally great violence.17 The sun's immediate manifestation of its power to make all things visible and significant "ennobles" and equalizes their fate in the same way: II ennoblit le sort des choses les plus viles, Et s'introduit en roi, sans bruits et sans valets, Dans tous les hopitaux et dans tous les palais.18 (11. 18-20) The "victor," in the opposition legislated by le soleil, is the signification as opposed to the intuition or representation, and the signified as op posed to the signifier. Yet the signifier necessarily retains its "rights"?its radiancy?and this is (as for those who would sleep under bridges instead of crossing them) something other than the power to represent. What else it is we may infer from the peculiar combination of references to a legislative or political realm and to a realm of natural process. Signifying gets de scribed both as "command" and as "growth." The "command" to the "harvests" to "croitre et murir / Dans le coeur immortel qui toujours veut fleurir" implies violent compulsion, first because "fleurir" (what the immortal heart "wants" to do) differs from "croitre et murir" (what it is made to do?or rather, what is made to happen "in" it), but second because "command" differs radically from "ripen." A process is identi fied with an act; the organic process of growth is linked with the 17- ibid., pp. 295-96. 18. Cf, in Baudelaire's Petits po'emes en prose, the poor child and the rich child of "Le joujou du pauvre," who "se riaient fraternellement, avec des dents d'une egale blancheur," on either side of the grill dividing the chateau from the thoroughfare; and the "legitime proprietaire" and "usurpateur" of "Le Gateau," equal in their hunger and ferocity.</page><page sequence="19">READING HEGEL WITH BAUDELAIRE 259 locutionary power of language. "Le pere nourricier" commands from all things the "harvest" of signification. To "be fruitful and multiply," in this context, is to flourish as a sign. Baudelaire inscribes the process of signification in the language of natural process?and reinscribes the language of natural process in a discourse designating an activity which is linguistic and political. These harvests that ripen at a command are the "after-ripening," the "Uberleben," which Benjamin ascribes to the literary work in his essay "Die Aufgabe des Ubersetzers": "Es gibt eine Nachreife auch der festgelegten Worte."19 Baudelaire fulfills?more surely than Hegel, here?what Benjamin designates the task of the philosopher: "the task of understanding all natural life in terms of the wider life which is that of language and of the political?that of his tory."20 What the signifier as such retains is not its "rights" to representation but its "life" as Uberleben, "survie," an after-life survival, in history. The radiancy of "hopitaux" and "palais" is merely a modulation ofthe "vague epouvante" that comes to linger about the "matiere vivante" apostro phized in Baudelaire's "Spleen": Quand sous les lourds flocons des neigeuses annees L'ennui, fruit de la morne incuriosite, Prend les proportions de l'immortalite. ?Desormais tu n'es plus, 6 matiere vivante! Qu'un granit entoure d'une vague epouvante, Assoupi dans le fond d'un Saharah brumeux; Un vieux Sphinx ignore du monde insoucieux, Oublie sur la carte, et dont l'humeur farouche Ne chante qu'aux rayons du soleil qui se couche.21 (11. 16-24) The sphinx is forgotten by the world?forgotten on the map: left (to survive) on the map,22 the signifier lives on in a history which lies not in living memory but in inscriptions, the materiality of which subsumes the "matiere vivante" of forms of life. Baudelaire wrote to Poulet Malassis instructing him to delete "fils" in the verse "L'ennui, fils de la morne incuriosite," and to substitute "fruit." For what must be evoked is not the successive order of generations, but a generation that may be 19.

This is bound to be represented as natural. The power of "le pere nourricier" is that of the law of signification conceived as natural, and that of language conceived as a heliotropic system of figures, grounding language in the nature of perception. We have seen the effects of such a power?to fill brains as well as hives with "honey." The representational elements in that verse, the figures of "hive" and "honey," would offer a pleasing picture could we ignore the infrastructure of the verse, the "et" that compounds the figurative with the literal. We would have a picture of the effect of genius, rendered in pastoral terms suggesting the detachment of the aesthetic from the historical or political realm. Figu rative language can offer such appearances; we read as much in the next couplet, where the poem proffers its one true simile, a "comme" which means like and not and: The crutch bearers appear like young girls?if only to themselves. The poem's one genuine figure of comparison, one use of "comme" to represent a representation, a resemblance, is made to represent a pathetic or grotesque illusion, to coincide with a complete disparity between inside and outside: the crutch-bearers may feel like young girls, but they do not look like them. Those who display a prosthesis become "like" those who are intact. This violation of the fundamental distincton between integrity and lack or disfigurement comes about through the equally fundamental procedure of treating the mind as a receptacle?the process evoked in the preceding line, whereby the organ of cognition (brains) is treated like the receptacle for a thing or a distilled essence (hives for honey). Thus the very term that expresses the possibility of resemblance between things of different orders, such as outsides and insides, or mental and physical properties, is made to represent their radical discrepancy. And the very use of the fundamental figure of the mind as a container with an inside is here made to coincide with the denial of the fundamental distinction between wholeness and lack. These verses represent the figurative function of language as dis figuring. They represent the disarticulation of the vital distinction be tween literal and figurative features which is. effected in the verse that sticks together brains and hives. "Le Soleil" sticks unlike things together not simply by means of figures, but by means of the linguistic infrastructure which makes figures possible or apparent, and which surfaces in the verses' "empty links." These consist not only in "et" and "comme," but also, conspicuously, in "les hasards de la rime." "Le soleil" has the power to treat mental objects like natural objects and ugly ones like beautiful ones: (il) "Eveille dans les champs les vers comme les roses." "The chances of rhyme"?</page><page sequence="21">READING HEGEL WITH BAUDELAIRE 261 that is, the chances of the letter, the strictly contingent homonymic value of the signifier?makes "vers" mean verses (and "towards"), as well as "worms." In the word "vers," the two different kinds of series? ugly (or urban) versus beautiful (or pastoral) objects, and physical versus mental objects, threaten to collapse into one. The difference between two kinds of difference gets lost. One is the difference between the order of signifiers and the order of signifieds; the other is the difference be tween one sign (or signifier) and the next. It is no longer possible, in this verse with "vers," to know whether we pass along from one thing to another, or cross over from one order of things to another. Where the contingencies of the signifier are not so material, where the disfiguration occurs at the level of the figure, our disorientation is not so great. Thus in "Spleen," we suffer a subtle betrayal of our expectations as a comparison shifts direction halfway through: "Je suis une cimetiere abhorre de la lune, / Ou comme des remords se trainent de longs vers" (11. 8-9). We take the sense ofthe second clause to be, "Ou des remords se trainent ainsi que de longs vers." But instead of following up the comparison of "I" to a cemetery with another com parison of a mental to a physical object, the second clause reverses the order and compares "worms" to "remorse." The figure betrays our ex pectation of a predictable hierarchical relationship between mental and physical objects and between tenors and vehicles. A mental property, remords, is ascribed that of a physical object, se trainer, and treated as the vehicle?instead of the tenor?for a physical object, vers. But the verse also says that long verses drag like remorse. This "comme" marks an illusion as fundamental as the single simile in "Le Soleil" ("porteurs de bequilles . . . comme des jeunes filles"): that the disarticulation of language is contained by a mood or a mind. Where "vers" means at once "worms" and "verses"?where verses are at once a mental and a material object? the distinction between vehicles and tenors, or signifiers and signifieds, is effaced. Just such effacement characterizes the "empty link" of mem orization, which is indistinguishably the link between the sign and its meaning and the link between one sign and the next?both of which, according to Hegel, must be effaced: recitation has to be both unreflec tive and "accentlos." Such indistinctness must afflict not only recitation as a special case, but practiced speech as such; Hegel mentions not just unaccented recitation, but the "parler sans accent, was mit Recht in Europa fur ein gebildetes Sprechen gefordert wird" (par. 459). To be come "versed" is to become incapable of distinguishing names and meanings. "Le Soleil" describes how the sun "awakens" verses: "Ce pere nour ricier, ennemi des chloroses, / Eveille dans les champs les vers comme</page><page sequence="22">262 CYNTHIA CHASE les roses;" (11. 9-10). These lines have the effect of a parody of lines that define the natural image in Holderlin's "Brot und Wein":23 "... nun aber nennt er sein Liebstes / Nun, nun mussen dafur Worte wie Blumen entstehen" (11. 89-90). To originate like flowers is to come into being as a natural object, whose "becoming coincides at all times with the mode of [its] origination," a spontaneous arising from the earth. This is pre cisely not the case for the "harvests" of "Le Soleil," which do not simply flower and flourish ("fleurir"), but are "commanded" to "grow and ripen." "Origin and tendency [Zweck]," writes Nietzsche in The Ge nealogy of Morals: "two problems that are not and should not be linked. "24 The conception of the natural object dissents from this stricture; the natural object's "origin" and its "tendency" are identical, and it arises as the incarnation of the principle of their identity. The natural object may be described as serenely teleological, as much as natural, distinguished not by mere genetic causality, but by freedom from conflict between the order of origins and the order of intentions, by harmony between necessity and purposiveness. Such harmony is promised by the "pur posiveness without purpose" of the freely beautiful object of which Kant's prime example is precisely a flower, a wild tulip.25 The tulip must be specified to be wild to distinguish it from those cultivated tulips with their blended colors and subtle markings that became objects of speculation on the world market in the 1630's. For the commodity is the inverse of the natural object. Its mode of being and its mode of origin do not coincide: it is manufactured, then ex changed. Another such inverse is the sign, which is posited, and then inscribed or read. A disjunctive operation of this kind is evoked by the sun which "Eveille dans les champs les vers comme les roses" and "remplit les cerveaux et les ruches de miel": a single predicate is made to designate functions which cannot be identical unless the sense of one or the other is violated. Beauty is made to sustain a shock. That shock is the deprivation of nostalgia for the natural object26?imposed by the spokesman of "Spleen" who inscribes verses as he inscribes worms, as well as by the soleil "ennemi des chloroses" who "awakens" worms and verses along with roses. The primacy of the mode of being of the natural object that 23.

The power of the sun to treat mental objects like natural objects is none other than the necessity of treating them as signs, or names, which can be memorized or inscribed, requiring a material trace. The materiality of signs gets thematized in the final couplet of the poem's first stanza?"Trebuchant sur les mots comme sur les paves / Heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps reves." But it may be said to materialize most insistently with the recurrence of the word vers in the second stanza. Vers there functions not only as a noun but as a preposition; it belongs to both prominent categories of words in the poem, names of items, and connectives. The sun awakens vers as it awakens roses (verse 10); and the sun makes care evaporate "vers le del" (verse n). This evaporation or dissipation "toward" a higher region is equivalent to Hegel's tilgen, the obliteration or cancellation of the natural properties of the thing as it becomes a sign. The linguistic contingency, the poetic necessity, that makes precisely the word "vers" express this movement "toward" another realm effectively disrupts our conception of signification as such a movement from one realm or order to another. For "vers" in verse eleven is contaminated with the "vers" of verse ten, which collapses (so we have read it) the difference between passage from one order to another and passage from one item to another of the same order. The very verse which should affirm the power of aesthetic cre ation to transcend the world of practical concerns and the merely natural order turns out to disqualify that power? because the very word vers, which should name the bridge from the realm of perception to that of reason, turns out to designate and exemplify the collapse of that structure in the materiality of the signifier. It is as words susceptible of memori zation and inscription?as vers, verse?that ideas appear, we read in Hegel's Encyclopedia. Passage toward (vers) signification or thought occurs in material signs (vers). The aesthetic exists as a persistent, residual materiality; it may not, then, be construed as a passage from the percep tual to the ideal, from the phenomenal to the rational. The rational or ideal is so insofar as it is significative and material. To get versed, this means, is the only way to go, that is, the only place to be. The preposition "vers" functions in this verse much as the connective "comme" functions in the penultimate verse of "Correspondances": II est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants, Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies, ?Etxl'autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants,</page><page sequence="24">264 CYNTHIA CHASE Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies, Comme l'ambre, le muse, le benjoin et l'encens, Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens.27 (u. 9-14) This "comme" means not "like" but "such as." At the very point at which the poem purports to name perceptions with the power of total ization, the verse merely enumerates: there are perfumes such as amber, musk, benjamin, incense. "Whatever differences or gradations one wishes to establish between them," writes Paul de Man, the scents are restrained by that "comme" from ever leading beyond themselves. "Enumerative repetition disrupts the chain of tropological substitution at the crucial moment when the poem promises, by way of these very substitutions, to reconcile the pleasures of the mind with those of the senses and to unite aesthetics with epistemology."28 In "Correspond ances" "the very word on which these substitutions depend"?in "Le Soleil," the very word on which depends the passage "toward" a total ization of perception as idea?"just then loses its syntactical and semantic univocity." This is "too striking a coincidence not to be, like pure chance, beyond the control of author and reader": a material occurrence. It is as material occurrences not amenable to conceptualization that history may have to be conceived once the concept of progression or regression has been dissolved as it is in Baudelaire's vers, where the concept of progression toward signification gets exploded. "Geschichte" means nothing else, perhaps, in "The Task of the Translator," the essay Benjamin wrote as an introduction to his translation of poems from Les Fleurs du mal. The disarticulation of the figure of progression ("vers le ciel") by a word for designation, inscription, and memorization ("vers") may be accompanied by an abandonment of progressive ideals. Baude laire throws out the ideal of progress in an irreverent note to his publisher Poulet-Malassis a propos of a letter from Hugo (October 6, 1859) in response to the dedication "A Victor Hugo" of "Les Sept Vieillards" and "Les Petites Vieilles." Hugo had written: Vous ne vous trompez pas en prevoyant quelque dissidence entre vous et moi.

Vous dotez le ciel du l'art d'on ne sait quel rayon macabre. Vous creez un frisson nouveau.29 The comic potential and the literalizing effect of Hugo's emphases? "Vous marchez. Vous allez en avant"?were not lost on Baudelaire, who wrote to Poulet-Malassis, . . . ne negligez pas de me renvoyer la copie avec l'epreuve. Ne negligez pas non plus de donner un violent coup de poing dans le plexus solaire de de Broise. Cela est necessaire pour la correction des epreuves et le Progres de la Typographic C'est la le Verbe et le cri de l'Art. Ite\ (N'imprimez pas ces dernieres lignes.)30 "L'Art pour le Progres" gets reduced to the progress of poetry?the progression of his poems into print, likely to be facilitated, in Baude laire's view, by the written approbation of Hugo. (Baudelaire had Hu go's letter reproduced at the head of his essay "Theophile Gautier.") The punch in the solar plexus that Baudelaire commands in his pleased parabasis?like the "traits redoubles" of the solar power in "Le Soleil"? is supposed to make things signify, to get them into print. How punch ing Poulet-Malassis's associate in the stomach would expedite this pro cess is unclear. The sun's "cruel" double blow should be conceived as equally gratuitous. For this is the bearing of the final comparison in "Le Soleil" between the sun and the poet. We have read how the hazards of rhyme and homonym decisively affect the annihilation of distinctions between men tal and natural properties and beautiful and ugly objects brought about by the poem's connective terms?"comme," "ainsi que," "et." Those terms also do away with the hierarchical distinction between the poem's first person and its titular protagonist, between "je" and "le soleil." The condition in which the poet goes forth to "Trebuch(er) sur les mots comme sur les paves" is finally defined as the time in which the sun behaves like that sort of poet, a flaneur: "Quand, ainsi qu'un poete, il 29.

Such a sun is not the "soleil qui se couche" cited at the end of "Spleen." Or rather, "Le Soleil" poses the possibility that when that sun goes down, or when it rises, it does so merely "ainsi qu'un poete [qui] descend dans les villes": it simply steps out, so to speak, for a stroll, without any guarantee that its itinerary will be complete or circular (as the reflexive verb "se coucher" would tend to suggest). This would mean that the order of signification, the intelligible order, is as radically unpredictable and arbitrary as the order of the minimal material marks that are the surface features of language (the alphabet, for instance, the condition for Hegel of the "intelligent" form of writing). If the sun simply "goes out," intelligibility becomes as vulnerable to extinction as the properties of natural objects. Here "har vests" are produced not by fate but by fiat (and complicity): "(II) com mande aux moissons de croitre et murir / Dans le coeur immortel qui toujours veut fleurir." And the fiat?"Be fruitful and signify"?may be no more necessary or inevitable than a fit of restlessness.31 For the sun to go out like a poet is irremediably different than for the poet to come out like the sun. Baudelaire's poem begins, we read, with a displacement of that Kantian metaphor by a metonymy: it is when the sun strikes that the poet goes out to engage in his fantastical fencing. If this sun goes out like a poet, as we read in the poem's final sentence, that metaphor in no way reverses the move made in the first stanza. It does not restore the displaced metaphor. For to act "ainsi qu'un poete" means, after Baudelaire's intervening vers, to stumble on signs, "to encounter its own as something picked up" (Par. 463)?not to generate meaningful forms, like Kantian nature or genius. The way in which Hegel and Baudelaire answer the question posed by Kant's affirmation of the crucial role of aesthetic judgment?the way they make it chapter and verse?decomposes irreversibly the analogies that sustain that affir mation. The irreversible occurrence of this reading, this reinscription of Kant's question, is the only crossing over that these texts permit us to contemplate. Cornell University 31.
