Guerrant Divisions of Geographic and International Medicine and Infectious Diseases, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville; Clinical Research Unit, Federal University of Ceard, Fortaleza, Brazil; and Center for Vaccine Development, Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC) are emerging as an important cause of persistent diarrhea, especially in children in the developing world, yet the pathogenesis of EAggEC infection is poorly understood. In an ongoing prospective study of childhood diarrhea in an urban Brazilian slum, EAggEC are the leading cause of persistent diarrhea. Children from this study with EAggEC and persistent diarrhea had significant elevations in fecal lactoferrin, interleukin (IL)-8, and IL-lj8. Moreover, children with EAggEC without diarrhea had elevated fecal lactoferrin and IL-lj3 concen- trations. The children with EAggEC in their stool had significant growth impairment after their positive culture, regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea. Finally, 2 EAggEC strains were shown to cause IL-8 release from Caco-2 cells, apparently via a novel heat-stable, high-molecular- weight protein. These findings suggest that EAggEC may contribute to childhood malnutrition, trigger intestinal inflammation in vivo, and induce IL-8 secretion in vitro. In 1987, Nataro et al. [1] described a unique type of Esche- richia coli isolated from children with diarrhea in Santiago, Chile. Like enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), these bacteria demonstrate mannose-resistant adherence to HEp-2 cells in tis- sue culture. However, unlike EPEC, they also adhere to each other and to the glass slide in what is classically described as a "stacked-brick" pattern. These bacteria were named "en- teroadherent-aggregative E. coli," although the name was sub- sequently shortened to enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC). EAggEC have subsequently been identified among the lead- ing causes of persistent diarrhea (i.e., illness M4 days) among children in developing countries.

In one of the most carefully studied cohorts (in an urban shantytown in northeastern Brazil), EAggEC are the leading cause of persistent childhood diarrhea [4-6]. They have also been identified in patients with AIDS [7, 8] and in travelers to developing areas [9]. Despite its increasing importance, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of EAggEC diarrhea. Pathogenic fea- tures identified thus far are unique aggregative adherence fim- briae (AAF), which mediate adherence in cell culture, invasion (which has been observed only in vitro) [10], and elaboration of three toxins: a small enterotoxin related to enterotoxigenic E. coli STa [11, 12], a heat-labile hemolysin [13], and a 108- kDa protein with cytotoxic effects in rat intestinal loops [14]. None of these has been definitively implicated as the leading pathogenic feature of EAggEC. In this study, we attempt to define the pathophysiology of EAggEC infection in a well-defined cohort of children resid- ing in an urban shantytown in northeastern Brazil. By mea- suring fecal inflammatory markers from infected children and controls, we sought to determine whether EAggEC induce elevated fecal lactoferrin (FLF) and proinflammatory cyto- kines and whether these organisms are associated with growth shortfalls even when diarrhea is not present. Moreover, we sought to identify a soluble factor from EAggEC strain 042 (shown to be pathogenic in healthy adult volunteers in the United States) [15] that causes release of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) from Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells in culture, suggesting a potential mechanism by which these organisms can produce intestinal inflamma- tion and growth impairment or diarrhea. 88</page><page sequence="2">JID 1998; 177 (January) Inflammation and Growth in EAggEC Diarrhea 89 Materials and Methods Patient population. The case and control subjects were ob- tained from a cohort of children in the Gongalves Dias favela (shantytown) in Fortaleza, Brazil (described in [4-6]). A total of 186 children from the 405 households in the favela have been followed from birth to age 5, with thrice-weekly visits to document the presence of diarrhea (defined as ^3 loose or watery stools/ day by the mother's report) or other illnesses. More details of this cohort have been described [5, 6]. Height and weight measure- ments were taken every 3 months. Stool samples were collected periodically from healthy children and during each episode of diarrhea. All stools were tested for the presence of common diar- rheal pathogens as previously described [4-6]. One E. coli isolate from each stool sample was subcultured and tested for HEp-2 cell adherence and aggregative adherence (AA), diffuse adherence (DA), and attaching and effacing gene probes as described [16- 18]. Strains defined as EAggEC included those E. coli demonstra- ting aggregative adherence on HEp-2 assay or hybridizing with the AA gene probe (or both). Children with positive stool cultures for EAggEC were classified into 3 groups: persistent diarrhea (PD; diarrhea M4 days), acute diarrhea (AD; diarrhea ^14 days), or no diarrhea (ND; free of diarrheal illness for 3 weeks before and after the positive stool culture). Control stools were from children in the same cohort free of diarrhea for 3 weeks before and after the sample and with no enteric pathogens isolated. For purposes of this study, children with exclusive EAggEC infection were those in whom an EAggEC strain was identified and tests for the other pathogens named above were negative. Stool analysis. Stool samples were tested for lactoferrin by latex agglutination (Leuko-Test; TechLab, Blacksburg, VA). Addi- tional samples were frozen at -70oC for cytokine testing. Small aliquots were diluted 1:2 (wtvol) in PBS containing 2.5 pg/mL leupeptin, 11 pg/mL aprotinin, and 0.5 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)ben- zenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, St. Louis). After thorough mixing and centrifugation (15 min, 10,000 g), supematants were removed and frozen at -70oC. Fecal supematants were tested for IL-8, IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra), and IL-1/? by ELISA (Quantikine IL-8 and IL-lra; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis; and CytElisal^; Cytlmmune Sciences, College Park, MD). Several stool samples with elevated cytokine concentrations in the ELISA were retested with the omission of secondary antibody-enzyme complex to ex- clude a contribution of fecal peroxidase or phosphatase; all of these samples produced an optical density of *c0.001. Cell culture and IL-8 release. Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells were provided by Cynthia Sears (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore). Culture media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies GIBCO BRL (Gaithersburg, MD) unless other- wise specified. Caco-2 cells were grown in a 50Zo CO2 incubator at 370C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (#12100; Life Tech- nologies) supplemented with 26 mM NaHCOs, 1 mM sodium py- ruvate, IX nonessential amino acids, IX penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/mL and 100 /xg/mL, respectively), and 10oZo fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Medium was changed twice weekly. Cells were passaged approximately biweekly by rinsing briefly in Ca^ - and Mg^ -free PBS and then incubating for 15 min at 370C with 0.2507o trypsin/2.65 mMEDTA in PBS. For IL-8 experiments, cells (passages 30-50) were plated at a density of 500,000/well in 24-well polystyrene plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and used at 5-14 days after seeding, at which time they were at least several days postconfluence. This high plating density was chosen to allow for rapid confluence and differentiation; nonadherent cells were removed by washing before each experiment. For cytokine release experiments, 0.5 mL of MEM without fetal bovine serum was placed into each well, and varying amounts (usually 5-50 pL) of the bacterial culture or filtrate to be tested were added. The cells were incubated for the indicated times at 370C (507o CO2 incubator) and the medium removed and frozen at -70oC before testing. Bacterial preparations. EAggEC 042 (044:H18) and 17-2 (03:H2), control E. coli K12 and HB101, EPEC E2348, and chol- era vaccine strain CVD-110 were obtained from the Center for Vaccine Development (University of Maryland, Baltimore). EAg- gEC 042 (plasmid-) and HB101:pJPN8 were prepared as pre- viously described [16, 19]. Strain 042:3.4.14 (042 carrying a TnphoA insertion into the gene encoding the major fimbrial subunit of AAF/II) is to be described elsewhere (Nataro JP, unpublished data). The Shigella flexneri isolate was from a patient with diarrhea. For cytokine release experiments, bacteria were grown overnight in Wo tryptone/1% D-mannose (Difco, Detroit) with shaking at 200 rpm in a 370C incubator. These conditions were chosen to duplicate the conditions under which our laboratory performs HEp- 2 adherence assays. Detection of IL-8 mRNAfrom Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks for 10 days. Two hundred microliters of 0.22-zzm-filtered cloudy overnight bacterial suspension (or l0Zo tryptone/1% mannose for the control) was added to 2 mL of fresh growth medium, and the cells were incubated for 21 h. The medium was removed, and total RNA was isolated by use of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). Reverse transcription was done on 1 pg of RNA from each sample by the addition of 1 mMeach dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Life Technologies), 20 U of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis), 100 pmol of random hex- amers (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), 10 mM dithiothreitol (Life Technologies), and 1 pL of Moloney murine leukemia virus re- verse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) in first-strand buffer (Life Technologies) in a total volume of 20 ph for 1 h at 370C. The reaction was terminated by a 10-min incubation at 970C and rapid chilling on ice. For controls, the reaction was done identically on the same RNA samples with the omission of reverse tran- scriptase and on a sample with no RNA template. RNA isolated from Caco-2 cells treated with 1 pg/mL IL-1/3 (known to contain IL-8 mRNA) was used as a positive control. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction was done by the addition of 10 pL of reverse transcription product to a solution containing 4 /xL of 10X PCR buffer A (Fisher Scientific, Pitts- burgh), 25 pmol each of 5' and 3' primers, and water to a total volume of 40 /xL. The reaction was heated to 950C for 1 min, and 0.5 pL of Taq polymerase (Fisher) was added. The reaction was cycled 30 times at 950C for 1 min, 580C for 1 min, and 720C for 3 min. Ten microliters of each reaction product was electropho- resed in agarose, stained with ethidium bromide, visualized by UV light, and recorded with instant photographs. The primers were obtained from Life Technologies and had the following sequences: 3' -TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC and 5f -ATGACT- TCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT. Statistical analyses.

Growth data were analyzed by use of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Anthropomorphic Software Package (version 3.0) and expressed as number of SD units above or below the mean population growth (each Z score unit ^ 1 SD from the mean). Means of infected and uninfected children were compared by Student's t test. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean ? SE; the highly skewed fecal cytokine values are reported as median (interquartile spread). Results EAggEC produce intestinal inflammation. Twenty-six stool samples with EAggEC and no other pathogens were ob- tained. Of these, 11 were from episodes of PD, 7 from AD, and 8 from ND. As shown in figure 1, FLF titers were elevated in most of these samples, regardless of the presence of diarrhea; in contrast, FLF titers were &lt; 1:50 in 12 of 15 controls (children in the study cohort with no intestinal pathogens isolated and no diarrhea for 3 weeks before and after the sample was taken). The differences were statistically significant (P = .001, Kruskal-Wallis; P &lt; .01 for each EAggEC group vs. controls, Mann-Whitney). By way of comparison, FLF titers &gt; 1:400 are routinely seen in shigellosis, while titers of &gt; 1:50 are rare in healthy people [20]. Fecal IL-8 and IL-1/? concentrations were significantly ele- vated in some of the sample groups compared with controls (figures 2 and 3; P = .017 for each, Kruskal-Wallis). Stools in the PD group had significantly more IL-8 than did stools of controls. Values are median (interquartile spread): 91.5 pg/mL (8, 2690) vs. 0 pg/mL (0, 14.6; P = .013, Mann-Whitney). There was a smaller but still significant elevation of fecal IL- 8 in the AD group as well: 16 pg/mL (8, 88; P = .049). Stools from the ND group had no increase in IL-8: 3.0 pg/mL (0, 11.7). Stools from all 3 EAggEC groups had elevated IL-l/? compared with stools from controls: PD = 676 pg/mL (110, 194,788; P = .009); AD = 172 pg/mL (23, 6879; P = .088); ND = 294 (63, 510; P = .018); controls = 29.9 pg/mL (0, 192.4). Of note, 5 patients in the PD group had extremely high IL-1/3 concentrations (25,200 to ^50,000 pg/mL). While IL-lra was detectable in all 4 groups and did not differ significantly among them (not shown), the ratio of IL- 1/3 to IL-lra was significantly elevated in the EAggEC groups compared with controls, as shown in figure 4 (P = .05, Kruskal- Wallis). Medians (interquartile spreads) were 0.4 (0.1, 1.6), 0.163 (0.039, 1.139), 0.174 (0.089, 0.644), and 0 (0, 0.09) for PD, AD, ND, and control subjects, respectively (P ^ .016, .033, .047; Mann-Whitney).

Stools from controls or children with exclusive EAggEC infection and persistent diarrhea (PD), acute diarrhea (AD), or no diarrhea (ND) were diluted in PBS with protease inhibitors and tested for cytokines by EIA. Children with EAggEC had significantly higher ratios than controls, presumably representing more IL-1 receptor activation in these groups (P = .05, Kruskal-Wallis; individual differences significant at P = .016, .033, .047 for PD, AD, ND vs. controls, Mann-Whitney). Chil- dren with EAggEC were also significantly more likely than controls to have ratios &gt;.01 (P = .007, .016, and .016 for PD, AD, and ND groups, respectively, Fisher's exact test). Horizontal lines indicate medians. FLF titer correlated with both IL-1/? and IL-1/ML-lra (r = .520, .466; P &lt; .001 and &lt; .01, respectively; Spearman rank- order correlation). Moreover, fecal IL-8 and IL-1/? were sig- nificantly correlated (r = .343; P = .021). EAggEC are associated with growth impairment. The finding of elevated fecal inflammatory markers in children with EAggEC, even without overt diarrhea, raised the possibility that some of these children may have sequelae of persistent intestinal inflammation, most notably growth impairment. We therefore analyzed data on these children's growth, which were collected as part of the prospective surveillance. Of 14 subjects with PD due to exclusive EAggEC infection, 9 had paired measurements of height, weight, or both during the 3 months preceding and 3 months following the positive stool culture. Similar data were available for 6 of the subjects with EAggEC but no diarrhea. As shown in figure 5, these groups of children had evidence of growth impairment during this period, as deter- mined by weight for age and height for age compared to stan- dard growth curves. The PD group lost 0.86 ? 0.57 SD units (Z score) of height for age and 0.50 ? 0.46 units of weight for age (P = .18 and .3, respectively, paired t test), and the ND group lost 0.64 ? 0.24 units of height for age and 0.20 ? 0.30 units of weight for age (P = .064 and .5, respectively, paired t test). When combined, the entire group with EAggEC as the only pathogen had a statistically significant decline in height for age after their positive stool culture (0.76 ? 0.34 units; P &lt; .05, paired t test). Similar growth impairment was seen in the larger group of children as a whole with EAggEC in their stools (i.e., including those with other pathogens with or without diarrhea). As seen in figure 6, these children had significant declines in both weight for age (P = .02) and height for age (P = .001) during</page><page sequence="5">92 Steiner et al.

EAggEC cause IL-8 release from Caco-2 cells. EAggEC, other intestinal pathogens, and control bacterial strains were assessed for their ability to release proinflammatory cytokines from Caco-2 cells in culture at 3 h. No IL-1/? was detected in supematants of Caco-2 cells exposed to these bacteria or their filtrates. Moreover, as shown in figure 7, control E. coli K12, CVD 110, EPEC strain E2348 (0127:H6), and S.flexneri did not cause significant IL-8 release from Caco-2 cells when grown to comparable broth culture turbidity to that of EAggEC 042 and 17-2. However, EAggEC strains 042 and 17-2 both released significant amounts of IL-8 from Caco-2 cells com- pared with E. coli K12 (296.75 ? 51.6 pg/mL, P &lt; .001, and 74.4 ? 20.6 pg/mL, P &lt; .02, respectively, Student's t test). These effects were reproduced by application of cell-free bacte- rial culture filtrates, suggesting that a soluble factor rather than cellular adherence was responsible for inducing the IL-8 re- lease. Culture medium alone (tryptone/mannose) did not release detectable IL-8 at 3 h. Measurable IL-8 release from Caco-2 cells was barely detect- able after 2 h of exposure to EAggEC 042 culture filtrates ^30 pg/mL) but increased sharply after 3 h and continued to increase for up to 24 h (figure 8). In contrast, filtrates of control E. coli K-12 released very little IL-8 at 3 h, even when grown to comparable bacterial numbers as EAggEC 042, as deter- mined by colony counts, optical density readings, and/or man- IL-8 (pg/ml) mean ?SEM Figure 7.

Subsequent analysis of this effect revealed the following observations. First, the effect of EAggEC 042 filtrates on Caco- 2 cells was consistently abolished by treatment with either trypsin (Sigma; 10,000 U/mL; 20 ypg/mL for 1 h at 370C) or proteinase K (Amresco, Solon, OH; 100 ptg/mL for 45 min at 42'C), even after subsequent protease inactivation with either 10% fetal bovine serum or soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma; 20 pg/mL). In contrast, IL-8 release was not inhibited by poly- myxin B (10 pg/mL) or heating for 15 min at 950C. Moreover, it was not present in filtrates after passage through 100,000 Mr filters (Centricon-100, Amicon; Beverly, MA). IL-8 release was not inhibited by coincubation with saturating concentrations (1 pg/mL) of IL- ra, suggesting that paracrine or autocrine release of IL-1 is not responsible for the IL-8 release. Finally, the 108- and 116-kDa EAggEC cytotoxins described in [14] (provided by Carlos Eslava, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City) did not release measurable IL-8 from Caco-2 cells at concentrations &gt; 1 pg/mL, and polyclonal antiserum against these toxins (at concentrations up to 1 mg/mL) did not block the IL-8-releasing activity of 042 filtrates. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from Caco-2 cells revealed a substantial increase in IL-8 mRNA after 21 h of treatment with filtrates of EAggEC 042 but not filtrates of E. coli K-12, compared with cells exposed to tryp- tone/mannose alone. As shown in figure 9, tryptone/mannose- or K-12-treated cells had barely detectable IL-8 mRNA, con- sistent with the lack of IL-8 release into culture supematants. In contrast, cells treated with filtrates of EAggEC 042 had amplifiable IL-8 mRNA qualitatively as great as that seen with IL-1/3. Moreover, Caco-2 cells exposed to filtrates of EAggEC 042 for 24 h, washed, and incubated in medium for 24 h more did not release elevated IL-8 compared with controls (data not shown). Together, these findings strongly suggest that the IL- 8 release induced by EAggEC filtrates is not due to cell lysis with subsequent release of preformed IL-8, but rather to pre- translational activation of IL-8 synthesis. In an attempt to localize the genetic site in 042 responsible for production of the IL-8-releasing factor, we tested the fol- lowing bacteria for IL-8 release from Caco-2 cells: 042 p- (cured of the AA plasmid), 042:3.4.14 (containing a TnphoA insertion into the AAF/II pilin gene on the AA plasmid), and HB 101:pJPN8 (a nonpathogenic strain containing the wild type 042 AA plasmid). The first 2 of these were clearly negative in the HEp-2 assay, while the third was weakly positive (occa- sional aggregated bacteria seen, but on &lt;20% of cells). As shown in figure 10, overnight culture filtrates of these bacteria released significantly less IL-8 from Caco-2 cells (in 20-24 h of incubation) than did wild type 042 (P = .001, Kruskal-Wallis). Interestingly, while the plasmid-cured 042 re- leased somewhat less IL-8 than did the wild type (505.3 + 70.1 vs. 806.1 + 169.6 pg/mL; P &gt; .1, Mann-Whitney), the other 3 X DNA marker Untreated Caco-2 cells Untreated control K-12 filtrate treated Caco-2 K-12 treated control EAggEC 042 filtrate treated Caco-2 042 filtrate control IL-113 treated Caco-2 IL-18 treated control Figure 9.

Total cellular RNA was isolated and 1 tg of RNA from each sample was reverse-tran- scribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. For controls, all reagents except reverse tran- scriptase were added to reaction. RNA (1 pg) isolated from IL-1/3- treated Caco-2 cells was run in parallel as positive control. Reverse transcription products were amplified with 30 cycles of PCR using Taq polymerase and published IL-8-specific primers. PCR product (10 MtL) was run in each lane of agarose gel, visualized with ethidium bromide and UV light, and photographed with instant film. Band of expected size (-289 kb) was strongly visible in lanes corresponding to 042 or IL-1,3-treated Caco-2 cells. isolates released significantly less (85.5 + 26.2, 156.5 + 23.3, and 168.4 + 28.8 pg/mL for 042:3.4.14, HBO11:pJPN8, and HB101 WT, respectively; P = .006, .003, and .011, Mann- Whitney). These same results were obtained regardless of the colony counts of the cultures before filtration. Interestingly, higher amounts of IL-8 were released from Caco-2 cells exposed overnight to filtrates of 042:3.4.14 that were concentrated by 50% or 100% ammonium sulfate precipitation but not similarly concentrated filtrates of E. coli K-12 (data not shown). These preliminary findings suggest that the active component in 042 filtrates is a novel high-molecular-weight, heat-stable protein encoded on the bacterial chromosome but released in reduced amounts when the plasmid is removed or altered. Fur- ther analysis of this factor is underway. Discussion EAggEC are being increasingly recognized as an etiologic agent in persistent diarrhea, both in children in developing areas and in patients with AIDS in developed countries. How- ever, they remain dramatically underreported, since their identi- fication requires either gene probing (which may fail to recog- nize as many as half or more of isolates) or the unwieldy HEp-2 adherence assay [4]. To complicate matters, they are frequently identified in "asymptomatic" children (i.e., those without overt diarrhea) in developing areas (15%-31% in Bra-</page><page sequence="7">94 Steiner et al.

However, a careful analysis of potential malnutritional or bowel-disruptive effects of EAggEC short of overt diarrhea has not been reported pre- viously. Some strains of EAggEC are known to cause diarrhea [15], but the pathophysiology of EAggEC diarrhea and the virulence traits that enable the organism to cause diarrhea in some people but not others remain poorly understood. Moreover, it is not clear whether EAggEC adherence itself is pathogenic (as with EPEC) or whether some soluble factor must be delivered by adherent bacteria. As noted earlier, several groups have identi- fied toxins as potential virulence traits for EAggEC, but a convincing link between toxin and disease (such as for Clos- tridium difficile or enterotoxigenic E. coli) has not been proven. The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that EAggEC produce an inflammatory diarrhea, as determined by elevations in fecal inflammatory markers. There is substantial precedent for this type of investigation. Fecal lactoferrin has been shown to be more sensitive for the presence of intestinal inflammation than microscopy for fecal leukocytes, since the latter degrade rapidly with storage and can lose their character- istic morphology [22, 23]. Elevated FLF is the best clinical predictor for C difficile colitis in hospitalized inpatients [24] and is the best available predictor for culture-positive bacterial enteritis [25]. FLF has also been used as a simple marker of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease, both to follow disease activity and to distinguish inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome or other noninflamma- tory conditions [26]. In addition to FLF, fecal concentrations of the proinflamma- tory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1/3 were measured. Previous work has established that inflammatory enteritides such as shigellosis [27, 28] and inflammatory bowel disease [29] are associated with increases in fecal cytokine concentrations, which are often undetectable in healthy controls. We have also recently re- ported elevations in fecal IL-8 and lactoferrin in subjects who developed diarrhea after administration of the cholera vaccine strain CVD-110 [30]. Finally, we measured the ratio of IL-1/? to IL-lra in stool as a potential marker for proinflammatory activity. In most studied systems, a 10- to 100-fold excess of IL-lra is required to saturate IL-1 receptors and prevent their activation by IL-1 [31]. While it is not clear whether similar ratios are useful to measure in stool (if, for example, the two compounds are degraded at different rates), it is notable that we found markedly elevated IL-1/IL-lra ratios in many of our subjects with EAggEC but not in controls. Further studies may help to validate the usefulness of the IL-1/IL-lra ratio in this setting. This study demonstrates that EAggEC are associated with evidence of intestinal inflammation, which is occasionally as severe as that seen with invasive diseases such as shigellosis. Interestingly, FLF titers were elevated even in children with EAggEC without diarrhea. Moreover, even these "asymptom- atic" infections were associated with growth impairment. These findings suggest that EAggEC may be an even more significant pathogen than was previously suspected, since many children labeled as "controls" in published epidemiologic sur- veys may actually have had subclinical infections with poten- tially serious sequelae. Moreover, this finding raises the possi- bility that malnutrition and poor growth may in many cases be due to previously unrecognized or unsuspected infectious agents. In the case of EAggEC, this effect may be due to intestinal inflammation or to the thick mucus gel with which they are associated in animal models or human intestinal ex- plants, which could theoretically impair absorption of nutrients [19, 32]. Given the degree of intestinal inflammation seen in children with EAggEC, we postulated that these bacteria could produce some of their pathophysiology by inducing proinflammatory cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells. Several reports have demonstrated up-regulation of these cytokines from T84 or Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells stimulated by Salmonella or Yersinia species or Entamoeba histolytica, but invasion and lysis were believed to be the critical events leading to this up- regulation [33, 34]. There are no published reports of cytokine 042 wild- type 042 p- 042: 3.4.14 HB101 wild-type HB101 pJPN8</page><page sequence="8">JID 1998; 177 (January) Inflammation and Growth in EAggEC Diarrhea 95 release from intestinal epithelial cells caused by adherent, non- invasive organisms, although pulmonary epithelial cells do re- lease IL-8 after stimulation with culture filtrates of Burkhold- eria cepacia [35]. Moreover, cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells has been demonstrated after treatment with C. difficile toxin A [36]. We demonstrate here for the first time that a noninvasive enteric pathogen can release IL-8 from Caco-2 cells and, more importantly, that this IL-8 release is due to production of a novel heat-stable, high-molecular-weight protein rather than to adherence of intact organisms. It appears that this protein is encoded on the bacterial chromosome but may depend on an intact virulence plasmid for appropriate synthesis or release; moreover, delivery may be enhanced by adherence of the or- ganisms. In vivo, both adherence and toxin production may be required (as is the case for other bacteria, such as enterotoxi- genic E. coli or Vibrio cholerae). The strong correlation between fecal IL-1/? concentrations and IL-1/ML-Ira ratios and the other inflammatory mediators (FLF and IL-8) raises the possibility that the effect of EAggEC in vivo might involve activation of IL-1 receptors, and a postu- lated release of IL-8 from Caco-2 cells via effect of IL-1 in subcellular compartments that was not detected in culture su- pematants and not inhibitable by IL-lra cannot be excluded. Further studies will be required to elucidate the signaling path- ways involved and to clarify the importance of proinflammatory cytokine release in the pathophysiology of EAggEC infection. In summary, we have found evidence that EAggEC produce an inflammatory enteritis in children that is associated with growth impairment, even in the absence of diarrhea. Part of the pathophysiology of EAggEC infection may be due to proin- flammatory cytokine release from the intestinal epithelium stimulated by EAggEC or their toxins. These findings also raise the possibility that some persistent diarrheal pathogens may be even more important causes of early childhood morbidity in developing areas than was previously recognized.
