<plain_text><page sequence="1">JMBRAS, VOL. 79 BOOK REVIEWS EARTHENWARE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA Edited by John M. Miksic Singapore: Singapore University Press , 2003. 370 pp. 75 half-tones, 180 line illus., tables, maps, 30-page bibliography. ISBN 9971-69-271-6 This textbook on earthenware, the most common, prehistoric material, includes twenty- two scholarly papers, originally prepared for a Symposium on Pre-modern Southeast Asian Earthenware. The Southeast Asian Ceramic Society, the National University, and the Asian Civilisation Museum of Singapore supported the Synposium and this publication. Editor John Miksic provides an overview through maps, tables, and technical references in a clear, uniform style, and coordinated some 750 bibliographical entries. The range of reporting extends from the Philippines and eastern Indonesia to the fringes of Oceania; from glimpses at Annam and Myanmar, to Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, and on to Borneo, Sumatra, and Java. The various contributors give insight into the current state of earthenware knowledge and stimulate directions of study likely to promote it further. Two introductory reports by Wilhelm G Solheim, doyen of Southeast Asian earthenware, are from the Philippines, where the presently known earliest Southeast Asian earthenware, 8400 bp, refers to the Spirit Caves. Bill studied earthenware in museum collections and in the field. His archaeological experience extends from Sarawak to Taiwan, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and East Timor. He explains how minute details may characterize the ware of one site from that of another, and how scholarly analysis and descriptions proceed. His vision of a Nusantara network of maritime trade which appeared to link Luzon with South China and Vietnam, with eastern Indonesia and the Pacific fringe, is based on prehistoric earthenware. He identifies ware characteristics around 2000 вс as belonging to the Sa-Huynh-Kalanay tradition. A parallel dispersal of carved and impressed ware named Bau-Malay, with paddle- impressed, stamped, and carved decorations similar to those in west and south China around 1000 вс, appears to have progressed from simple open-air firing to kiln-firing on the Southeast Asian mainland. Bill explains that international foundations, owners of archaeological sites, or museum collections normally seek plain answers to questions of date and origin. To be practical in providing intelligence rather than putting every sherd to lab-analysis is his advice. Two other papers from the Philippines, by Wilfredo Ronquillo and Eusebio Dizon (both from the National Museum), summarize archaeological work earlier undertaken, including in the Duyong sites in Palawan, collectively named Tabon, to which long sequences onward from 30,500 bp refer, and where earthenware is associated with burials from around 1500 вс. A unique recovery is the so-called Manunggul Jar of around 800 вс. Sculpted of clay on top of its cover is a ship, prow-and-eye motif identified just 103</page><page sequence="2">PART 2, 2006 as on traditional craft as they still operate in the Sulu Sea. Dizon tells of adventure in southern Mindanao, where from a tiny cave (2x11 m), named Ayub after its discoverer, sensational earthenware was retrieved. When Haj i Ayub first entered the cave some forty years ago, and saw tall, anthropomorphic jars lined up on its sides there, he believed he saw devils. First, he engaged treasure-hunters to look for gold in the cave and later leased it to guerrilleros for storing weapons and ammunition. When a museum team finally got there, only the lower portions of thirty burial jars remained approximately in situ. On top and around them had fallen the multiple debris of years of alienation. It was like putting together a giant three-dimensional puzzle. Of thirty jar-covers, each one was unique. The sculpted head of a chief on the cover of Earthenware is on one of them. Like the Manunggul Jar from Palawan, the Ayub jars from Mindanao typologically range between 800 ВС and ad 500. A joint contribution by David Bulbeck and Genevieve Clune (both from Australian universities) is on earthenware recovered in the Macassar region of south Sulawesi. It summarizes information on the environmental conditions of the region prior to the Dutch Occupation of 1667, when dense populations caused settlement close to and on top of prehistoric burial grounds. Clandestine looting of pots eventually drew attention to them. Approximate dates for earthenware derive from imported stoneware or porcelain found buried alongside. Earthenware was ranged into four partly overlapping groups: 'long-lived, 1 1th- 20th century', 'proto-historic, 1 1th- 16th century', 'proto-historic Imperial, 13th- 18th century', and 'Imperial Islamic Colonial, 15th-20th century'. Comparing these Sulawesi categories with earthenware from elsewhere suggested a close affinity with those of the Sa-Huynh-Kalanay tradition. Following MacKnight, the authors concluded that prior to the sixteenth century, the main thoroughfare of communication southwards to Sulawesi was via the Sulu Sea. D. Kyle Latinis and Ken Stark (from the National Museum in Singapore and Kwantlen University College) jointly report on sites in Maluku, NNW of Papua (Irian Jaya), where as early as 40,000 bp small groups of people subsisted on strand and marine environments. Archaeological surveys of 1992-8 produced earthenware from caves and settlement areas dating after the fourteenth century. Certain patterns present on this ware seemed related to Maluku tattoo and bark-cloth designs. Limitations of the material, however, preluded definitive classification. Two contributions by Santoso Soegondho, Mundardjito, Ingrid Pojoh, and Djuwita Ramelan (all from Sastra University) deal with earthenware in Java. Soegondho, who includes Sulawesi, as well as Bali, Sumba, Flores, and some Sumatran references in his survey, briefly recognizes Indonesian earthenware as predominantly pre-modern. He lists it from five horizons extending from 'neolithic' to 'living', and describes its function as both utilitarian and ceremonial. He provides a useful table which lists various vessel shapes along with other artefacts of clay, such as figurines, bricks, and finials. All authors bemoan the sad neglect of earthenware studies in Indonesia. The special concern of Mundardjito, Ingrid Pojoh, and Djuwita Ramelan is the Yogjakarta region and its Siwaist and Buddhist temple sites (c.8th-10th century), whence they describe and illustrate various vessel shapes, such as tempayan jars and kendis. By the tenth century, as much as seven Javanese kendi varieties existed, some with typically Indianized or Southeast Asian outlines, others with typically Chinese ones. A contribution of excellence is by the late Hilda Sumantri (Jakarta). She writes of the ceramic artists of the Majapahit kingdom of eastern Java (1 1th- 15th century). From 104</page><page sequence="3">JMBRAS, VOL. 79 epigraphy and historic, literary sources, she reveals that in Trawulan, the capital, two leading ceramic artists were active, a 'chief of potters' (kalula) and a 'chief of sculptors' ( manapul ). She describes how the latter, by a combination of coil and pinch in the hand, produced spontaneous clay-portraits, and how they tended towards realism; and how, by contrast, moulding (or part-moulding) produced rigidity. Sumantri's review of indigenous and foreign characters, animals, and buildings representing Majapahit in clay was taken from the Trowulan Museum. Gods or rulers are not amongst them, only handsome, coiffured commoners, ascetic types - turbaned, bald, or with a tall cap (as in contempo- rary Bali). E. Edwards McKinnon (Bandung) describes earthenware from Sumatra, where in prehistory, human presence was in small, isolated groups. Contacts with long-distance trade first occurred in the north-east. At Kota Cina, midway on the east coast, seven types of earthenware were excavated, including imported, fine-paste, and wheel-made varieties, as some were known from Persia, South India, or Sri Lanka. Undecorated or paddle- decorated pots were represented in refuse dating from the 11th to 14th century ad. More fragmentary records relate to Sumatra's south and west. Of special interest is a reference to Palembang, the former seventh-century seat of the Malay polity of Srivijaya. From here, fragments of two-, even four-spouted tendis are described. A study by Leong Sau Heng (University of Malaya) introduces a rare Southeast Asian vessel, a cord-marked tripod with straight, overlong, conical, and vented legs; the equally cord-marked legs were formed separately and stuck on to the outer base. The literature identifies Ban Kao (Thailand) as the type site for the shape, where dates roughly between 3720 and 140 вс apply. The same tripod was later found in twenty other Southeast Asian sites, most of them located in the isthmian region and associated with burials. Food was not cooked in these vessels, only reheated for ceremonial occasions. The author found one 'Chinese' parallel, one identified with the Shih-hsia culture of Guangdong Province. Though the origin of tripod shapes is summarily assumed to be 'China', the author prefers to characterize the striking variety he studied as typically Southeast Asian during the second millennium вс. Nik Hassan Shuhaimi Nik Abd. Rahman and Asyaari bin Muhamad (ATMA Institute of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia) jointly report on proto-historic earthenware from sites near Kuala Selinsing in Perak, where Evans and others had excavated earlier. Based on glass- and stone-beads, a seal in Paliava script, and a gold ring recovered there, the sites - variously labelled 'Indian', 'Hinduized Indonesian', or 'Indianized' entrepôts serving the collection and storage of hinterland produce for long-distance trade - are situated in mangrove areas. They are mounds containing food shell and archaeological refuse of seven or eight phases lasting from c.200 вс to ad 90. Based on pétrographie analyses and X-ray diffractions, decorated earthenware fragments obtained during 1990 were classified into seven categories and altogether 105 types. Amara Srisuchat (Fine Arts Department Bangkok) reports from the narrow, isthmic belt of southernmost Thailand, where multi-directional trade followed overland crossings. Relevant excavations are reviewed. Khao Sam Kaeo is a site dating from around 100 вс to ad 200, where stone and bronze ornaments, a kettle drum, carnelian beads, and a Brahmi inscription are recovered. From a similar site, Khuan Luk Pat, a fine-paste earthenware was derived, together with Indian clay seals, various coins, a Chinese bronze mirror, glass-slag, and beads. Earthenware is described in terms of fabric and function. Fragments of miniature stupas are one remarkable aspect. Simple technologies of potting 105</page><page sequence="4">PART 2, 2006 and open-air firing were deployed until c. ad 200: New tempers and new shapes become apparent thereafter. Ruth Prior (Institute of Archaeology, London University College) and Ian Glover of Britain report on Early Historic Earthenware in Central Vietnam. Based on publications up to the 1990s and some unpublished, Vietnamese source material, a multi-national (Vietnamese-Japanese-British) field study of 1993-2000 is described. Prior sampled for petrography while Mariko Yamagata analysed vessel forms. Sa-Huyin, Solheim's type site south of Da-Nang, was the main reference point. Doubts remained as regards the cultural affiliations of levels between c.500 вс and ad 200 which recent Vietnamese scholarship ties to the Cham, whose linguistic affiliation is with the Austronesian language family. This places them apart from the Khmer, whose linguistic affiliation is with the Austroasiatic language family. The authors describe Sa-Huyin earthenware in stages. First, it is elaborate and carefully finished. Ring-stands and burial jars with 'lamp-shape' covers are typical. Later shapes and decorations are more varied, though less carefully finished, and new painted designs are added. The last Sa-Huyin stage runs to about ad 200 and is more or less contemporary with the Dong Son culture. But whereas Dong Son used inhumations, associated with bronze, the Cham used secondary jar-burials, associated with iron. Over 37,000 earthenware sherds came from Khuan Luk Pat, to which broken bricks, tile fragments, and pots incidentally found by villagers refer. Kendis are similar to those from Oc Eo. Lids and covers are common, as are pedestals, solid or hollow. Stephen Chia (Universiti Sains Malaysia) uniquely refers to a prehistoric open-air firing site in easternmost Sabah, where the excavated deposit dated between 4340 and 50 вс. The site named Bukit Tengkorak is on top of a small headland, once part of a coastal ridge 600 m above the Tando Bulong Channel leading from the Sulu Sea south towards Sulawesi. Over 20,000 wasters of poor quality were extracted. Heaps of a kaolin-rich clay containing quartz grains were related to a clay source at the foot of the hill. Evidently, this clay was carried uphill to where the pots were formed and fired. Presumably the draft on the hill was an advantage. The pots, hand-moulded by the paddle-anvil method, were finished with carved and bound paddles. Vessel shapes included cooking pots, lids, and charcoal stoves, much like those a few local potters still make in Sabah. 4 A Preliminary Cultural Geography of Contemporary Village-Based Earthenware' is the contribution by Leedom Lefferts (Drew University) and Louise Allison Cort (Smithsonian Institution). It presents a new classification of pot-making, one which may lead to the elucidation of extant geographical distributions of the pottery craft itself. Basic is the assumption that differences in the appearances of pots are due mainly to the ways by which they are formed. Clay-preparation and methods of firing are therefore excluded from the study. The focus is on the 'formative stages' of pot-making, when potters reveal whether they work at random or in accordance with some 'tradition'. How a potter begins to handle clay is first determined. One method, here identified as 'transformative', has the total clay-mass necessary for a pot present from the beginning. Another method, named 'additive', has potters assemble the quantity of clay needed in stages. The deployment (or not) of a wheel appeared to pre-determine the choice of method. The geography of the two methods is next considered. Using all clay at once appears to be characteristically Khmer; the staged alternative, Thai-Laos though by exception, is also relevant in some northern Khmer villages. Various deployments of slow- and fast-moving wheels had less clear-cut associations. More research is recommended along the lines described. 106</page><page sequence="5">JMBRAS, VOL. 79 Charlotte Reith, a lifelong potter from Virginia (USA), describes firing techniques from forty-five Myanmar villages. Her main interest is the 'bonfire' method; as the author put it, the most critical stage of pot-making. If done carelessly (or bad luck is at play), many hours of hard work can be undone. Asked why the villagers fired pots the way they did, the simple answer was 'we've always done it like this'. Fuel included cattle dung, straw, grass, bamboo, coconut husk, and sundry fibre in various combinations. How fuel and pots are ranged into a 10 m square, how manure is used for a base, and how thick layers of fibre and the pots are piled are all illustrated. Fire might be started with or without covering, and may last ten minutes or longer. Up in the Shan States, villagers mixed dung with water and used this for an outer coating of the firing mound. Some potters stood pine-bark up against the pots and dumped a thick soup of manure over the top and sides of the firing mound. On the lower Irrawaddi, a significant variation was observed. Here flues were spaced over the firing area, and then arched over with pots. Fire, strategically lit on three sides at first, drew air through the flues. After lighting the fourth side, the fire continued to burn for about 90 minutes. Thereafter, all covers were removed and the hot pots thrown over with sawdust. This produced black smoke and a black covering of pots. Reith believes that the observed flues represent a first step from bonfire to kiln-fire. Finally, Dilip Medhi (Department of Anthropology, Gauhati University), reports on Assam, a land of green hills enclosed by Bhutan, China, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, where potters in agrarian communities still make earthenware. However, since pots of metal are available, the market for it declined and the pottery craft became a sideline occupation. The author describes ware from seven regions, including cord-marked ware as it is typical in most of Southeast Asia. Assamese potters remain strongly tied to their traditions. In hilly terrain, people commonly chew pieces or wads of 'charred/baked clay', and villagers mainly use pots for profane purposes, In the plains, where a wheel-made, kaolin-rich variety of pots is marketed in parallel, pots may also be used ceremonially.
