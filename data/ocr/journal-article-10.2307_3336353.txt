<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cosmos, Cosmetics, and the Spirit of Bondo FREDERICK LAMP One of the most proliferated forms of art in Africa is the mask of the Bondo or Sande association of women found throughout most of Sierra Leone and northwestern Liberia. It is a form that varies little from one ethnic group to the next, individualized mainly by inci- dental details such as the shape of the fa- cial features, the style of the coiffure, and, in the superstructure or decoration, by a number of items such as figures of birds, horns, and amulets presumably bearing iconographic significance. Despite our familiarity with the object, we know little about the identity of the mask and its spiritual referent. We have learned a great deal about the Bondo (usually misspelled as "Bundu" by Euro- peans) or Sande ceremonies and the pro- cess of initiation, and we have seen hun- dreds of examples of the mask, including quite a few illustrations of masks in use. But we have no oral text on the geo- graphical origin of the spirit, its charac- teristics, its function within the spiritual world, or its relationship, if any, to the development of ritual structure in the area. Even the sexual identity of the spirit is in dispute among scholars. In the absence of text, however, we are not at a complete loss if we use the tools of art historical study, especially that of formal analysis, with the view that the form may embody and manifest a cul- tural code. Executed with such confor- mity throughout a broad area by so many different artists, the form of the mask suggests a considerable consensus of thought-a conception of a particular spirit's characteristics, and a more fun- damental cosmological taxonomy, human ontology, and an ecology of spiritual and mundane factors. A pro- found work of art may synthesize a uni- verse of ideas with some central themes as well as a complex intellectual ramifica- tion that may be deciphered painstak- ingly through the examination of struc- tural relationships. The context of this discussion is the women's Bondo association among the Temne people of Sierra Leone, which is universal among Temne women. Bondo is also the name used indigenously to designate the related women's associa- tions among the Limba, Loko, northern and southern Bullom (the latter called Sherbro by the English), Bom, Kissi; southwestern Kuranko, and Krio in the city of Freetown. The term Bondo is sometimes used interchangeably with the term Sande among neighboring groups to the south, where mutual privileges are upheld to some extent. But these organizations are more properly called Sande, Sandi, or Saneng (accord- ing to the area) among the Mende, Kono, Kim, Vai, Dei, Bassa, Gola, Kpelle, Belle, Gbandi, and Loma (see map). All the above-named groups, except the Kuranko, Kono, and Belle, have been documented as using the helmet mask at least in isolated cases, although it ap- pears to be used most in the core area of Mende and Vai, and extensively also among the Temne, southern Bullom, Bom, Kim, Gola, and Bassa. The origin of both Bondo/Sande and the helmet mask is uncertain, but the Temne, Bul- lom (Hall 1937: A133), Vai (Holsoe 1980: 97), and Gola (Meneghini 1982:1-2) tes- tify to a Mende origin for the mask. The mask of the Bondo/Sande most commonly is called Sowei in the current literature, and this is the term most often used by the Mende today. I choose to use the term N6wo (pronounced "Naw- woh," rapidly, with equal syllabic stress),1 not only because it is the only term used by the Temne, whose system is under discussion here, but more im- portant, because this is certainly the older form of the spirit's name used by the Mende, Bullom, Bom, Kim, Vai, Kissi, and Loma peoples. One only needs to refer to the early literature.2 1. NOWO LEADING THE FINAL BONDO PROCESSION.

The masked dancer among the Mende has been called Sande-Yafe ("the Sande Spirit") or Sowei-ndoli-mo ("Sowei's performer," or "the Sowei who performs"-literally, the "the Sowei play-person"), which is not a true name but rather a description (edrej 1980:138; Richards 1974: 275-76; Schoen 1884: 100). The use of the term Sowei for the masked spirit is clearly a recent development picked up by ethnographers and art his- torians that abbreviates the longer de- scriptive title identifying the mask with its owner. This distinction is critical to an understanding of the meaning of the mask and the identity of the spirit, as we will see in a moment. Nowo appears in many different con- texts. In the ritual of the Bondo she ap- pears principally in the coming-out ceremonies of the initiates, in which she leads the girls from their ritual washing at the river to the center of the village (Fig. 1). Prior to this she dances at sunrise in a public solo performance of choreog- raphic and movement virtuosity. During initiation she first appears to the young girls in the secret forest enclosure, ban- daserma, at the time of their genital inci- sion, when her overwhelming presence is said to mesmerize them and relieve the pain (Gervis 1952: 229-30). During the in- itiation period she dances with the girls, inspiring awe and trepidation, and it is she who judges infractions of Bondo law and executes punishment when it is re- quired, either on delinquent initiates or on men who violate the sanctions of Bondo (Innes 1965: 62-63; Hall 1937: A142-43, 263; Alldridge 1901:142, &amp; 1894: 136). She may also appear at the burial and funeral of a Bondo member (Eberl 1936: 325-26). In these ceremonies any number of N6wo performers may ap- pear together, although usually only one appears at each event.3 During ritual she is accompanied by lesser officials who continually fan her, readjust her cos- tume, pick up loose strands of raffia that might happen to fall on the ground, and cover her with a mat if she wishes to re- move the mask for a respite. N6wo appears in dance wearing a black wooden helmet mask, a gown of black raffia attached to the mask and fall- ing below the knees, and black or dark cloth covering the arms, hands, legs, and feet (Fig. 1). In short, she is totally black except for a white strip of cloth always attached to the pinnacle of the mask, left to fall behind her. N6wo's blackness identifies her with the color of human be- ings (therefore, the physical world of mankind). It is important to distinguish between "blackness" (ri-bi in Temne) and "darkness" (an-sum), like that of night. Blackness refers to the acquisition of color, as in the dyeing of cloth, rather than the extinguishing of light. The Temne say, "We are all dyed" (Sa yi ing- bis), indicating not just a color but a metaphysical process of refinement and acculturation. That black is to physical as white is to spiritual is overwhelmingly supported by ritual evidence, but most poignantly by the fact that while the Bondo initiates are in seclusion they are painted a dull white, but when they re- turn to society their bodies are polished with oil to maximize their brilliant black- ness (Figs. 2, 3). Blackness characterizes the female principle, whiteness the male. Every 2. NOWO (SEATED LEFT) WITH BONDO DANCERS (CENTER) AND GRADUATES (RIGHT) AT FINAL CEREMONIES. TEMNE, ROTIFUNK, BUMPEH CHIEFDOM, 1937. female spirit I have witnessed in dance ritual has been manifested in physical form in the color black or near-black, even though the spiritual, in general, is white, and though female apparitions (such as those of spirits guiding diviners) are said to be white.4 Most male spirits are predominantly white or off-white, including male anthropomorphic mas- queraders (such as Gongoli, the jester, and ka-Bemba, the ancestor-bush spirit), whose black masks are usually spotted or dabbed with white and whose cos- tumes are of bleached, undyed raffia. Of all Temne spirits that I have inventoried from informants' testimony as well as those I myself have observed, in cases where sex was indicated (it is often am- bivalent), sixty percent of female spirits were primarily black or colorful (the con- ceptual equivalent of black),5 which is notable considering the fact that they share the dual and contradictory charac- teristics of being female and spiritual, and are, in many cases, represented by male dancers. Ninety-six percent of male spirits, on the other hand, were primar- ily white or its equivalents, unequivoc- ally invisible, or gray (Lamp 1982: ap- pendix A).6 Elsewhere (Lamp 1979: 25), I have exemplified the complementary oppositions of female (blackening, civilizing) and male (whitening, spiritualizing) with the description of processing raffia, in which the men deal with the destruction of life, the rawness of living matter, and its bleaching (for male spirits), while the women deal with its reclamation (to make brooms) for purposes of refinement and with its pigmentation (for female spirits). It is only fair to insert here that the sexual identity of the Sande/Bondo spirit is under vigorous dispute among scholars of the area, who find some am- biguity in the testimony of indigenous observers and practitioners. Principally, d'Azevedo (1980: 86; see also 1973:148) has contended that the spirit (Zogbe) is not female but represents, among the Gola, the "male ancestral tutelary spirits": "They are referred to as the spiritual 'husbands' and 'owners' of all Sande women on behalf of the commun- ity. Their behavior is imperious and ag- gressive, and human males fear their power and jokingly refer to them as the 'lovers' of their wives. Below the elabo- rate mask and the black raffia gown they wear men's shoes and trousers .... Though the woodcarver may have given a female name to his mask, or enhanced it with the symbols of feminine beauty and powers, the women give it a man's name and present the fully vested Zogbe as a sacred male personage." Among the Vai, the gender designation is reported in contradictory terms. Svend Holsoe (personal communication) says that either a man or woman may wear the 30</page><page sequence="4">11 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ? 3. BONDO INITIATES. TEMNE, YONI CHIEFDOM, 1980. mask in public dance. Ellis (1914: 54-55) wrote that the spirit is a "woman dressed as a man," but he persisted in using the feminine pronoun and expressed what may be the crux of the matter: "Her con- tinued influence depends upon the con- cealment of her identity, and although she is dressed as a man she is neverthe- less a woman" (1914: 155). Indeed, the Vai Zoba, just like the Gola Zogbe, wears men's shoes. Several masks in the style of these northwestern Liberian peoples are even carved with what seem to be narrow, stylized beards around the chin; it is not documented, however, that these are Sande masks. The fact that the Vai and Gola claim that their spirit may come from either the river or the forest (Phillips 1984: 11) may, in itself, imply a sexual ambiguity, in terms of spatial con- cepts that we will explore later on. Yet Phillips (1980: 122-24) clearly describes the Vai spirit, and not just the imper- sonator, as female, and Monts (1984: n. 7) states that the Vai "constantly refer to Zoba as musu nyana (lit. 'woman devil')." Ellis's implication, however, is that the spirit is feminine cloaked in male garb-perhaps to legitimize her identity as a figure of power, a chief. It is known that the famous Madam Yoko, a Mende chief at the turn of the century, also wore articles of men's clothing in official coun- cil, and that unmarried female chiefs were admitted to the men's P6r6 associa- tion (Newland 1969: 129). Female chiefs are known to wear men's hats, whereas male initiates of Poro and Rabai wear women's headties at particular stages. Furthermore, sexual designations in ritual are often reversed to indicate rank: male Por6 initiates of the Mende are called the "wives" of their adult male tutors. The last boy to be initiated in a Temne Rabai session is called "Vagina." The title given to the elder male lineage mate of the Gola Sande leader is Mama ("Grandmother") Fuwb (d'Azevedo 1973: 128). One could go on endlessly with examples that throw into question the meaning of the designation "hus- band," given by the Gola, within a com- plex ritual system rife with polar trans- formations. Our interpretation of terms would be aided by an examination of the system in which the Sande spirit oper- ates on various levels. Although there is no published reference to the use of the name N6wo for the spirit among the Gola, the name is given by Westermann (1921:153) as a woman's name. Among all other ethnic groups, the spirit is portrayed straightforwardly as female (Alldridge 1894: 136; &amp; 1901: 140- 4. NOWO IN REHEARSAL WITH INITIATES. TEMNE, YONI CHIEFDOM, 1980. 31</page><page sequence="5">41; Hoffer 1971:170; Hommel 1974: 6; Jed- rej 1980:139). Among the Temne it would be unthinkable for a man to masquerade as N6wo. Men unequivocally regard her as the representation of female sexual al- lure, and frequently play at attempting to seduce her as she mingles with the crowd during the afternoon dance con- certs just before the final procession of graduating Bondo girls. Of the Mende and Gbandi N6wo, Eberl (1936: 329) wrote that "the fundamental idea is the representation of a woman's head" (my translation). Sawyerr (1970: 91) felt that "whatever sex is attributed to the cultic spirit of Sande, the feminine associations are singularly prominent." According to Cosentino (1982: 17), Sowei and the masked dancer Gonde (who precedes her in dance, wearing a disheveled wreck of the Sowei mask) are sisters: the former is the flawless beauty and the lat- ter is her antithesis. Bledsoe (1980: 73) has found among the Kpelle that the Sande spirit is regarded as the "sister" of the Por6 spirit, and that this "is signifi- cant in symbolizing the kin relations be- tween Poro and Sande leaders." The Krio call the spirit "Mammy Queen" (Leo Spitzer, personal communication), and this is probably taken from the con- 5. LEPIDOPTERA CHRYSALISES: A. SMERINTHUS OCELLATUS (FROM R.

Hall (1937: A149) recorded a Bullom song that indicates that N6wo, here given the per- sonal name Mabe ("Female Chief"; Pichl 1967: 5, 72), has a husband. The mothers of initiates sing: "We come, Mabe. You, Soko [Sowei, the head Bondo leader], you see my child. ... Mabe, I would go with you but your husband here plays ordeals. I'm afraid of ordeals" (my free retranslation). The husband of N6wo, it seems, is the Bondo leader, who, of course, is female. My aim here is to show that not only is N6wo the guardian and patron of the physical realm (which is in- troduced through the female principle), but that the spirit itself is characteristi- cally female, as the mediator of that 6.

DUIKER HORNS EMBELLISH THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT ON TOP realm, and is of human derivation though maintaining permanent resi- dence in another world. Closure and Female Metamorphosis That the spirit of N6wo crystallizes the concept of closure in the female realm is signified by her name. The term nbwo (a-nbwo, with its noun prefix) in Temne means "the Lepidoptera (moth/butterfly) chrysalis." Many informants agreed that the zoological form was identified with the mask, but they could not tell whether the mask was named for the chrysalis or vice versa. All agreed that the chrysalis is an object of great beauty. Common to both forms is the series of rings at the base (abdominal segments on the chrysalis) (Fig. 5). Around the back of the chrysalis, just at the top of the base rings, especially on the Danaidae (monarch but- terflies), common in Sierra Leone, a hori- zontal row of small nodules (tubercle scars) may be seen (Fig. 5d). These are reproduced around the back of the mask in several cases from the Temne and Bul- lom (Figs. 4, 7,18). The large flaps on the sides of some masks (Fig. 4) seem to re- produce the wings of the chrysalis, and a small, round mirror may be placed at the site of the wing tubercle (Fig. 5d).7 The bases of the developing antennae often project upward beyond the chrysalis's head (Fig. 5b-c). These were described as horns by the Temne (cf. Fig. 24). The length of the chrysalis's antennae and the melathoracic legs, located at the bor- der of the wings in ventral view (Fig. 5c), may be the model for some masks in which the face is framed by two serpents facing at the neck (Fig. 6). Often the an- tennae lines are scored (Fig. 5d), resem- bling the fine line of braiding around the face of the mask (Figs. 2, 7). The chrysalis, especially that of the moth, is dark in color-often black-hard, and 32 I</page><page sequence="6">8. NOWO. MENDE, KAILAHUN DISTRICT (?), LATE 19TH-EARLY 20TH CENTURY. 41cm. COLLECTION OF JAMES SILBERMAN. glistening, like the mask when it is well polished with oil. The butterfly or moth that emerges from the chrysalis is related in Temne proverbs to female sexuality ("She claps and opens up"; i.e., the labia are com- pared to butterfly wings) and to the powers of women, especially to the elu- sive powers of the evildoers. A gathering of butterflies in one spot in a field is in- terpreted as an inauspicious omen. Their frequent fluttering around small pools associates them with mediumship, as water is the medium between the spiritual and physical worlds. To ordi- nary eyes they appear to be common but- terflies, but to one who has "four eyes," they are revealed as evildoing, transcendent human beings. Moths often have a circle in the center of each wing, resembling the "four eyes" of spiritual beings. The flight of butterflies occasions a flutter of barely perceptible breeze, like the breeze of spiritual be- ings felt just over the shoulder (Butt- Thompson 1970:189; Littlejohn 1963:13). The fluttering of N6wo's hands as she dances is similar, as is the rapid skitter- ing of her feet and oscillation of her torso. Most moths, and some butterflies, are nocturnal or crepuscular; N6wo, too, dances principally at dawn, never in daytime, in the final ceremonies of Bondo initiation. The chrysalis, naturally, refers to physical development as metamor- phosis. It is a bound form, enclosed in- side a shell, like the girls in Bondo kantha ("Bondo enclosure," the Bondo house), from which it cannot escape until its de- velopment is complete. It is the third stage of development (after the egg and the caterpillar), just before adulthood, as is the Bondo initiation (after gestation in the spiritual world, and childhood). The chrysalis of the Danaus chrysippus, the most common butterfly in Africa, like some others, feeds on toxic milkweeds, and the adult butterfly is itself so toxic that it is unpalatable to predator birds. Bondo is described as difficult medicine, preparing the women's defenses against the forces of evil. In addition, this but- terfly has a life cycle roughly equivalent to that of the moon (Oven 1971: 42), which is the unit of measurement used in the timing of initiation procedure. The metamorphosis of the chrysalis seems to be a perfect metaphor for the transforma- tion of immature and sexless human be- ings into beautiful, powerful women. Origin of the Spirit: The Call over the River "N6wo is not a thing made by human hands," the Temne say. N6wo is a spirit, and it is from the water that she is said to be drawn by the Bondo official Na-Soko (in Temne). Her relationship to water is sometimes indicated by a zigzag line, the glyph for water all over Africa, inscribed on her forehead (Fig. 8). Na-Soko re- ceives the spirit, not automatically on the strength of her office, but on the "call" of Nowo from beyond the water, cele- brated in the lyrics of a Bondo song: Ange ro yangkal I til ma-telalRo-bing mbri. Ya-e ang-wol a-mi. (Those in [the Bondo offi- cials' house]/-I heard the call/Over the river./ Mother, my ritual dance.) One Na-Soko gave me an account of the "taking" of the spirit: "In a dream, N6wo appeared to me and told me to go to the river and beat drums. I went into the river and stayed under for three days to arrange for the taking of N6wo. But the water that I went under was not the water of this world [i.e., it was the water of the otherworld]. I had arranged a group of people on the shore who began to beat drums. They began to play and sing, and I saw N6wo coming, little by little. Then I arose out of the water. I took 1,1 ~lY 9.

TEMNE, LATE 19TH CENTURY UNIVERSITY MUSEUM, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. the head of Nowo-only the head, not the raffia body-and I carried it out with me. Then I prepared the raffia dress for it." Many such spirits are often said to appear to the submerged official, and she may reject each one in turn until she sees the one she wants (cf. Phillips 1984: 11). The first mention of the N6wo mask among the Temne appeared in 1926 (Frere: 64) although it was clearly docu- mented in 1894 (Alldridge: 135-36) among the Mende.8 But evidence exists of ritual performed by the Temne and other groups that suggests a possible precursor of the procedure for obtaining the mask and perhaps a prototype of the mask itself. Butt-Thompson (1970:48; cf. Blyden 1969: 70-71) described a ceremony performed by a Temne Bondo leader in Koya chiefdom: "A Bundu woman plays tricks with crocodiles. A strong and fear- less swimmer, she dives amidst the rep- tiles and stirs them from sleep, calling to them as she flirts the water into their eyes, and making them follow her as she swims rapidly away down the Bunce Creek ... It is claimed that this woman can enter the water nude and with hair in disarray, swim for some time beneath the surface, and return with her hair coif- fured and her body clothed in bands of beads." A similar claim was reported to John Matthews (1966:138) in 1788: "They 11. BUST OF DR. SIAKA STEVENS, PRESIDENT OF SIERRA LEONE. PORT LOKO, CA. 1978. BRONZE. ALL PEOPLES CONGRESS, PORT LOKO CHAPTER. tell you their conjurers will go into the water with their hair loose, and continue there half an hour; that they will come up with it perfectly dry, and plaited very neatly after the country fashion."9 Formal Characteristics The above testimony suggests a concern of Bondo and the chief formal charac- teristic of the mask: the sacred function of female grooming and its metaphorical connection to spiritual righteousness as a fundamental virtue of civilizing female force. The mask of N6wo varies from type to type in its iconography, but a constant characteristic is a coiffure using elaborate patterning like that illustrated in Figure 9 for braiding, variants of which can be seen in Figures 8,12,17,18, 19, and 31. The delicate coiffure of women stands as a symbol of human re- finement, both male and female. Any Temne definition of beauty must include a reference to such refinement. A homely but well-groomed woman with refined ways is more likely to attract male attention than a disheveled woman with fine natural features. Alldridge (1901: 113) reported that among the Mende the dressing of the hair was the longest operation in which the women engaged, often taking several days to complete. This underscores the impor- tance of beauty by acquisition, reflecting one's familiarity with and dedication to the culturally designed patterns of or- dered excellence. The fine lining of the hair suggests the order of civilization just as the cultivation of the land refers to the refinement of the earth by man for the purpose of repro- duction and sustenance. In fact, to mean "braiding," the Temne, when speaking 12. NOWO. MENDE, VALUNIA CHIEFDOM (?), EARLY 20TH CENTURY EX-COLL: PACE GALLERY. English, use the word "planting," which may be derived from "plaiting." Both planting and plaiting are the tasks of women. "Planting" is not only a metaphor for cultural refinement but also a reference to the acquisition of adult maternal status; the initiates of Sande among the Mende just before their re- lease are gbogbini, "ready to be planted" (Jedrej 1976: 256). One ritual in the final ceremonies of Temne Bondo is e-lukne, "the transplanting," a chaotic dance in which the world is turned topsy-turvy for the moment of transition from spiritual life in initiation to ordinary domestic life. The next ritual is ka-kutha, "the cultivation," in which the villagers mime the tilling of farmland with sticks, and the men sing, eagerly anticipating the acquisition of a wife and accompany- ing pleasures: "I've secured my own farmland ... As soon as I get there I'll plant it" (Me pong gbo sbthb am-bara . . . Ka i be' ro i sak ti). Planting/plaiting im- plies enrichment through the medium of women. Around the base of the mask of N6wo are the series of rings resembling the chrysalid segments. The usual catalogue entry tells us that these are rings of fat around the neck, considered desirable in Africa, but this categorically is false, and is unsubstantiated by either field re- search or an iconographic analysis of the mask. If we examine the use of neck rings (concentric neck creases, to be more precise) in a larger corpus of sculp- ture, we can easily see that it is only in 13. NOWO AT FINAL BONDO CEREMONIES.

In figures (Fig. 10; see also the surmounting head in Fig. 18) the neck is more often elongated than broadened, and the carved rings are often too closely spaced to represent fat. One would be hard pressed to find examples of figural sculpture, which we believe to display the canons of the human aesthetic, that portray obesity, either in Sierra Leone or in the whole of West Africa. The "Venus of Willendorf" is European, not African. In fact, obesity clearly is held undesir- able in both the ritual Bondo and the mundane Temne context. A Temne proverb warns, "Both thinness and fat- ness are ridiculed" (A sel ma-ldngki a sel ma-bonda-Williams 1956:16; my transla- tion and transliteration of the Temne). If we can assume that the Bondo associa- tion expresses its ideals not only in its sculpture but in its educational product as well (i.e., the graduating girls, who are severely scrutinized by the commun- ity at the final ceremonies), and that Bondo earns the overwhelming and uni- versal support of the community be- cause of its success in achieving its ideals, we must accept the appearance of the graduate as an index of Bondo ob- jectives. With very few exceptions, she is a young woman of slender to medium proportions. If fatness were desired, it certainly would be achieved to some ex- tent over the customary twelve-month period of initiation among the Temne. Nevertheless, fine lines encircling the neck are considered beautiful for both men and women. A Mende friend re- called to me that because of her neck rings his wife (who was quite slender) was given the nickname Juwi (a variant pronunciation of Sowei used at Bo) when she was in school, and that she was considered the most beautiful in her class. In representations of the current president of Sierra Leone, Dr. Siaka Ste- vens, his neck rings are always promi- nently indicated (Fig. 11). Eberl (1936: 317) wrote that women bound their necks in order to produce the skin creases; indeed, some N6wo masks are carved with the representation of twisted twine between the rings (Fig. 12), and some figures of the Temne are pro- vided with twisted wire rings bound in the neck creases. The carving of neck rings dates at least to the sixteenth century, among the art of the Sapi (the name then used to de- signate the Temne, Bullom, and Baga; Lamp 1983), as in a kneeling female stone figure (Fig. 14) and an ivory carving from either the Temne or Bullom, in which a monstrous head set upon a ringed neck is surmounted on the back by a crocodile (Fig. 16). The crocodile is occasionally the dominating motif on masks of N6wo, re- calling the testimony of Butt-Thompson and Matthews on the facility of the Bondo official with this water creature and with water itself. It is precisely this relationship of Bondo with water, and the derivation of Nowo from beyond the water and through the water, that dictates the form of the base of the mask. My own infor- mation from the most knowledgeable persons in the field is that neck rings suggest not only the basal rings of the chrysalis but also the ripples of water radiating about N6wo as she is drawn from the water by the Bondo official. This has been corroborated by Frank Dubinskas (1972: 39) for the Mende: "Several informants told me that sowo are seen coming out of the water; that is the way the spirit appears to human be- ings. The neck rings are an extension of the concentric waves which are found on still water by the sowo head breaking the surface. It is these rings in the water which the neck rings represent: 'They are due to the resemblance to the spirit coming from the water' . . . (e nja hun hanii loma mu a lo)." Water and the serpent are often as- sociated in African iconography and are often represented by the same glyph. This association may be found on quite a few Bondo masks that bear a motif of diamond shapes along the neck rings (Fig. 12). Several ivory heads from the sixteenth century also bear zigzag lines (Figs. 15, 16) (cf. Read &amp; Dalton 1899: 38). The serpent, like water, is often used as a motif by the Temne to indicate a boundary or transition, as in the fine line of braided hair at the forehead, or, in ar- chitecture, a circle of rods called "the python" (ngiring), situated between the walls and the roof. In Temne sculptural carving it is im- portant to distinguish the head from the 14. FEMALE FIGURE. SAPI, 15TH-16TH CENTURY. STEATITE, 22cm. MUSEUM FUR VOLKERKUNDE, BASEL. 15.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. rest of the body, and in fact this is the first step in the carving. The diminutive head is associated with the spirit and the intellect, with ancestral rights and obli- gations received through the pat- rilineage (ma-kas). The body, on the other hand, is large, as earthly things seem to be in contrast to the things of the distant otherworld, and it receives its physical characteristics from the mat- rilineage (ma-kara) (Littlejohn 1960: 71). All this is to say, simply, that the impor- tance of distinguishing physical and spiritual entities and of marking points of mediation is clearly evidenced in Temne sculpture and other arts, and that the serpent and water serve as an impor- tant reference. In addition to the neck rings and the coiffure, there is a third component of the mask: a projection from the top of the head that appears either in the form of a small knot or in a profusion of motifs drawn from nature. The significance of the three components as a set will be explored later, but first, let us examine some of the most common motifs at the top of the head. Our inventory will cov- er masks from all the ethnic groups; those motifs I have found on masks of the Temne, as well as other groups, in- clude all of those listed except for the crescent, the overturned cooking pot, and seed pods. Smaller human figures. These are often in the form of twins emerging truncated from either side of the head (Fig. 17). In 18. NOWO. BULLOM/MENDE, EARLY 20TH CENTURY. AU- THOR'S COLLECTION. A FEMALE HEAD, FACING BACKWARD, SURMOUNTS THE MASK. other cases, a single head appears on the crown of the mask, facing either forward or backward (Fig. 18). Small figures are usually carved by the Temne and others as sexually mature adults, even those intended to represent children, in- cluding infants. The position above the head recalls the Temne concept of the east as the "place of descent" (ro-thoring) or as the direc- tion "up" (ro-kbm), the word for which is similar to the term for "place of birth" (ro-kom), which is, in fact, a function the east traditionally has held for parturient mothers. There is some evidence that al- though the Temne fully understand the biological process of sexual conception, like many other groups throughout the world they think of the act in terms of the descent of the fetal spirit from above and the spiritual conception of the child in the head, the seat of all spiritual receptiv- ity (Lamp, forthcoming: n. 13). In the two versions of the Temne creation story an association is made between the creation of life and the head as a bearer. In one (Timothy 1952: 61), the primordial child was borne into the world in the mother's topknot. The topknot, as it sometimes appears on N6wo masks and on figures (Fig. 10; cf. Fig. 19), resembles the small head on some N6wo masks (Fig. 18). In the other creation story (Schlenker 1861: 12-17) two events seem relevant: the crea- tion took place on the head of a "great person," and the taking of "pills" (through the head) resulted in the first conception by the primordial woman. "Bearing," in Temne, is synonymous 19. NOWO. BULLOM/MENDE, EARLY 20TH CENTURY. COLLECTION OF PHILLIP ABRAMS. with "porting" (sara), and the wearing of a mask on the head is said to be a metaphor for the bearing of a child (Sayers 1927: 111), expressed in the phrase "I have carried the mask on my head" (I po' sara a-rbng). The figures on top, therefore, surely refer directly to the production of off- spring, and indirectly to the production of multivocal power and opportunity, like that afforded by the birth of twins, with their extraordinary dual powers. Auspicious birth certainly is a concern of Nowo who wears two (or four) bells tied either to the top of her mask (Fig. 13) or to the rear of her costume, said to represent the vitality of twin fetuses in the womb (Parsons 1964: 37, 39). One mask (Fig. 19) represents the topknot in the form of a rattle, known, significantly, as the "egg in cage" (Phillips 1984: 4). The Hen. There is a Temne proverb that says that "the hen sits on her brood but does not crush them." Bondo, like the hen, is responsible for the discipline and restriction of its members, but its laws, though harsh, are meant to protect the delicate germination of new life. The brooding hen is a symbol of the head of a household, and the welfare of the former portends that of the latter (Thomas 1970: 90). Dapper (1964: 224) reported in the seventeenth century that the Sande in- itiates were called "hens of Sande." The hen is a natural reference to mothering. 37</page><page sequence="11">Other sorts of birds that apparently are not domestic fowl are also found on the Bondo mask. Phillips (1980: 124) has identified the dove, although without signifying reference. The Serpent. This motif is usually repre- sented encircling the top oif the mask (Figs. 21, 28) or arching sagittally from the nape of the neck to the crown (Fig. 5). We have seen that the serpent is as- sociated with water as a medium of communication as well as a definition be- tween physical and spiritual worlds. Just as in Benin art, the vector of the serpent is generally from up to down, if vertical, and seems to refer on the mask to the de- scent from the spiritual world above, bringing a renewal of life to the physical 20.

If horizontal, the serpent lies from back to front along the top of the mask, facing the front; the rear is the place of the spirits (Butt-Thompson 1970: 189), unseen, while the front is the "seen" world. This vector from the spiritual world to the physical is the vector of human de- scent and birth. In the boys' Rabai initia- tion, the spirit associated most with the rebirth of the boys is the rainbow ser- pent, Ningkinangka (Lamp 1978: 43-44); one mask of N6wo seems to feature the rainbow carved on the side of its right crest (Fig. 22; cf. the serpents in Fig. 23). In a wall painting from the Kpelle in Liberia I found the zigzag image of the serpent seeming to drive like lightning into the top of a woman's head (Fig. 20), suggesting the conception of a child. Sawyerr (1970: 75) has reported that among the neighboring Mende it is be- lieved that when a woman dreams of a serpent she will become pregnant, and he has associated the creature with "the rhythm of life attributed to the moon": "This association is based on the fact that reptiles live underground; but perhaps their ability to regenerate themselves by casting off their skin is even more signifi- cant in this connection. In this regard, snakes and serpents manifest the fact of 'becoming' as definitely as the life- death-life cycle noticeable in agriculture and demonstrated supremely by the phases of the moon. It is therefore signif- icant that during the rite at which Sande initiates are taken to the river for a ritual bath just before they make their debut to the outside world, Mende women are seen to carry a large package which rests unsteadily on the head of the bearer. This package, it is said, contains a python." Pregnant women often tie a serpent skeleton at their waists to encourage a successful birth. The great spirit of Temne Bondo, generally known as o-Karfi-ka-am-Bondo, is also known by the name of a-Dar-a-bana-ra- ang-gbeng, meaning "The Great Thing of the Sound of Thunder" (visually, lightning), which is said to allude to the crack of a hatching egg. It is this "Great Thing," represented by a serpentine procession of women, one of whom car- ries the package mentioned by Sawyerr, which gives birth to the initiates, as new adult women, at their final ceremonies of "coming out." The serpent is associated not only with birth but with the perpetuation of the life cycle, as suggested by Sawyerr. On some Gola masks it surrounds and seems to be feeding a bird nesting on top of the mask (Fig. 21), suggesting its role in association with sustenance. (All ser- pent and bird configurations are mouth to mouth, and the bird often seems to bend down to meet the serpent.) The serpent, as perpetuator, is the antagonist of the frog and lizard (Figs. 4, 23), images of ill omen. In oral narrative, the frog is a clear symbol of death and of the end of all brightness and vitality; at dusk he heralds the night, and at the beginning of the cloudy, rainy season, his cry, "Thor, thor, thor" ("Come down, come down, come down"), as interpreted by 21.

The frog is the primary symbol in all entry phases in the boys' Rabai initia- tion (Lamp 1978), times of metaphorical death, while the serpent presides at the times of renewal. 10 The Crocodile (Figs. 25, 26). Evil persons often turn themselves into crocodiles in order to attack enemies. These animals are considered malicious, for obvious reasons, but human command of a croc- odile is associated with tremendous po- tential. Among the Vai, the meais are reversed but the end is similar: the croc- odile is said to be able to turn into a beau- tiful girl who deals in supernatural pow- ers (Ellis 1914: 66). Its bile is said to be poisonous, and if one is shot, that part must always be presented to the chief. The power of crocodiles, as we have seen, is brought under the control of the chief Bondo official. Among the Vai, again, a crocodile under human control can be commanded to bring riches in its mouth (Ellis 1914: 66). Metal plating. Thin strips of metal often are added to the mask, particularly on the coiffure. Usually it is used to clarify the lines of the coiffure, just as the ser- pent is used: at the forehead just at the hairline, on the periphery of high sagittal crests, or wound about the lines of braid- ing. Metal and metalworking refer to the refinement of man. Fine, shimmering 25. NOWO SURMOUNTED BY A BUSH COW WITH HEAD BROKEN OFF. TEMNE, MALAL CHIEFDOM, EARLY 20TH CENTURY. 41cm.

The Bush Cow and Bush-Cow Horns (Figs. 24-25). Horns are used by the head Bondo official to contain healing potions. The horns themselves are highly re- garded. In 1490 Eustache de la Fosse (Hair 1973: 52), visiting the area of Cape Mount, complained that, of all the goods his ship held, it was his empty gunpow- der cow-horn that was stolen by visiting Africans from the shore. The fundamen- tal characteristic of bush-cow horns is that they sprout from the top of the ani- mal's head and show that physical maturity has begun. The Crescent (Fig. 27). The Temne month begins with the new moon, signifying both "the death of the old moon" (a- ngof-a-fi) immediately before, and "the birth of the new moon" (a-ngof-a-fu) at the first reappearance. The beginning of the moon is related to all sorts of begin- nings, as when the Temne gather on high places to clap their hands at the first sighting of a sliver of moonlight, just as they clap for the mother at the first peek at a newborn child. The new moon is as- sociated with the east, the place of birth and rebirth, in that it is said to be "up" (Margai 1965: 7), as opposed to the full moon, which is said to be "sitting down." 26. NOWO.

HISTORISCHES MUSEUM, BERN. 39</page><page sequence="13">The Overturned Cooking Pot (Fig 28). At the beginning of Bondo initiation, after genital surgery, the neophytes are given their first meal in the sacred grove. This consists of a bowl of plain rice flour mixed with water (e-reke), recalling the Temne creation story in which it was the first meal given by God to the primordial couple as their primary sustenance be- fore they were given the gift of fire and cooking (Schlenker 1861: 14-17). At the completion of this ritual act in initiation, the pot used to serve the meal is over- turned, signifying the fulfillment of the act of creation and the commencement of civilization. Other, smaller forms of ornamenta- tion decorate the coiffure; therefore they serve a function similar to the preceding items, as an embellishment of braiding and a development of the metaphysical concept. The horns of the blue duiker (Figs. 7, 17, 22) are also used by Bondo officials to contain power potions. Their spiraling lines suggest the exponential curve of creation and growth, common throughout West Africa. Cowrie shells (Figs. 24, 27, 28) often embellish the cos- tumes of religious practitioners who have achieved high rank. The ostenta- tious display of money signifies the ac- quisition of productive status. Cowrie shells, formerly used as a medium of ex- change, in earlier times were woven into the hair of Bondo initiates on the day of their final presentation to the commun- ity; today they are replaced by the Leone note (Fig. 29). Seed pods (Fig. 30), an ob- vious and literal reference to the concept of germination, were also often sewn into the hair of the newly initiated women (Alldridge 1894: 134). They are analogous to the initiates, at the point of coming out, as illustrated by the song sung by the mothers when the girls are enclosed in the central meeting house just before their final release: "Greens are germinating in the meeting house" (Ma-kereng-kereng ma loko ro-bare). The foregoing elements have in com- mon a reference to the concept of the .germination of new life, and the poten- tial for productive and well-rewarded growth. The indicators of productive status spring from the ground of braid- ing, the lined head like that of the earth- giant who supports natural growth through the lining of the land. At the pinnacle of most masks of Nowo, sometimes alone, sometimes in combination with some of the motifs at the top of the head, is a configuration representing high lobes of braided hair such as women frequently wore in the past, generally in three symmetrical arches (Figs. 24, 26, 30) or sometimes in five (Figs. 22, 23, 31), seven, or even nine (Fig. 12). Looking at the mask from the front, we see the projections at the top as lines radiating from the head (Figs. 24, 36). I would like to suggest that this is most similar to the sign used frequently in wall painting to signify the idea of sprouting (Fig. 32). The configuration, formed by a tall vertical line flanked on each side by two or four shorter lines radiating diagonally, resembles a plant form. Characteristically, verification of the hypothesis is not forthcoming from either the Bondo officials or the carvers of the masks, who are sworn to absolute secrecy on even the most obvious and general aspects of the association's pro- ceedings. It is, however, given in a read- ing of the context and the form. The iconography at the top of the mask, as I have shown, refers to sprout- ing, maturing, and potential growth. On the hair crests, in fact, foliage sometimes quite literally is carved (Fig. 30). Other masks suggest foliage with serrated edges on the crests (Fig. 27), organic projections marked with veins, in- terspersed with floral rosettes (Fig. 8), and braids rising up to peak, marked with spiraling lines suggesting the crea- tive spiritual force of fertile growth. A mask in the Sierra Leone National Mu- seum is surmounted by a spiked foliate form atop a ringed neck. The Mask as Cosmographic Index I would like to show that the mask of Nowo, as a tectonic form, embodies a structure consistent with the spirit's role and representation, paradigmatic with the structure of cosmological space. To this end, I must digress to a considera- tion of Temne space as it is evidenced in village planning. The Temne village would generally appear to the casual observer as a rather haphazard arrangement of houses of various shapes, in various states of de- cay, around a large open space of irregu- lar dimensions, in the center of which is a simple pavilion (bare). In fact, with the aid of a compass, one finds that there is a great deal of order in the village layout, which is consistent enough to suggest some principles fundamental to Temne 28. NOWO.

Data from other nearby groups, such as the Mende, Bullom, and Gola, on village planning would be extremely useful, but are not available, so I confine myself to the Temne model, with the suspicion that similar models could be found elsewhere if only one looked for them. The layout of the model village can be seen in Figure 33, which I orient with east at the top in accordance with both Temne and Mende thought (Temne: east=ro-kbm, "up," or ro-thorbng, "place from which one descends"; west=ro-pil, "down." Mende: east=ko, "to go up high"; west=kpundo, "the lower place"; Schoen 1884: 49,185, 251; Cosentino 1982: 197-201). Villages are intended to be cir- cular, laid out on an east-west axis de- scribed by footpaths leading in and out of the clearing. A village may contain a number of ritual sites, of which there is a broad repertoire available in the various ritual systems operative on regional levels. Several sites are considered more central than others to the significant def- inition of metaphysical geography. A vil- lage may have all, none, or a partial in- ventory of such sites. If we were to enter from the east, which would be most auspicious, we would first encounter the gardens, tended primarily by the women. At the edge of the village would be the enorm- ous cotton tree shading a miniature pavilion known as the boro-masar, the ancestral house of stones (Lamp 1983), where the ancestral spirit is given new GARDENS *? ?? * ??

Moving into the village we would find at its edge the house used for the initiation of women, the Bondo kangtha, where the neophytes are placed for a year of regeneration into adult- hood. At the opposite end of the village we would find the ominous workshop (bare-gbang) of the blacksmith, who forges weapons of destruction with fire. In the same general area would be a miniature house, the seth nga am-Pior (House of Poro), regarded with a degree of terror by both men and women, where male and female initiates are gathered to be led out of the valley by the path to the west to "die P6or" or to "die Bondo," as the beginning of initiation is described. Proceeding along this path, we would enter (if it were not forbidden) a thick, often primeval, forest. This is the home of the most secret of the men's Poro gatherings, and of the dreaded Poro spirit, responsible for the ritual death of Poro initiates.12 East (up) and west (down) are thus at- tributed female and male properties, re- spectively, or properties of beginnings and ends, birth and death, rebirth and ritual death, conjunctions and disjunc- tions. The Temne say that the sun dies in the west, and to face west is inauspi- cious, but "it is the east," I was told, "that has power. We get sun from the east, and all other good things. It is from 31. NOWO. BULLOM/VAI, EARLY 20TH CENTURY, 37cm. KATHERINE WHITE COLLECTION, SEATTLE ART MUSEUM. 32. COMMON DESIGN REPRESENTING THE SPROUTED PLANT IN PAINTING. the east that the ancestors came. God first sent them to the east and from there they went everywhere in the world." The east is the place where potential nourishment is cultivated. West is the site of graves. In the Temne creation story (Schlenker 1861:12-15), we are told: "... when God made the world, he put it on the head of a great person, . .. who revolved toward the east. This person revolves, but softly, imperceptibly, fi- nally to face the west; then men will know it;... the whole world will be at an end, and everything in this world will perish" (my re-translation). Just as the village has its own internal dyadic system, so it can be demonstrated to figure in a dyadic cosmology as has been postulated for so many societies in Africa and around the world. For the Temne,the cosmos consists of two prin- cipal categories, that of the physical world, called no-ru ("here, at the place of braiding"), and that of the spiritual world, called ro-siki ("there, at the place of penetration," i.e., at the penetration 41 ........ .... ....</page><page sequence="15">of the invisible, dim realm of the sup- ranatural, equivalent to the dim realms of the forest and the night). Elsewhere (Lamp 1982) I have gone to great lengths to associate the female principle with the transition to nb-ru and the male principle with the transcendence to ro-sbki, as well as with, respectively, the characteristics of open and closed, cultivated and un- cultivated, near and far, and visible and invisible, among other oppositions. No-ru is cognate with rusma, meaning "to bring up, rear, cultivate," which is the work of women in the civilizing es- tablishment of the home and family. Braiding, of course, is a female occupa- tion. "Penetration," as in ro-sbki, may be associated with the male, not only in sexual intercourse, but in his role in hunting and reclaiming the forest for ag- riculture. Between village and bush, and be- tween nb-ru and ro-sbki, is, theoretically, the river. The term mbri, used to de- signate the other side of the river, as in "I kb ro-miri" ("I'm going across"), means, literally, "opposite" and signifies a qual- itative dichotomy between the two di- vided areas. The dead are said to cross a river on their journey from nb-ru to ro- sbki. Water is the medium that turns physical beings into spiritual beings, es- pecially in ritual bathing, and spiritual beings are stripped of their spiritual powers by splashing with water. Ances- tors are reincarnated through the ritual washing of their representative stones at the boro ma-sar. Water is the gestating fluid of rebirth, called, in the esoteric language of initiation, yankoila, "Mother Water." The Temne create visual images that seem to express this cosmological model in the form of diagrammed successions that in concept resemble the four mo- ments of the sun's rotation, as revealed in regard to the Kongo of Zaire by Robert Thompson (1981), although I have not come across any complete literal solar reference. One such series is found stamped into the iron shaft of a sword, just above the hilt, dating to the trade wars in the late nineteenth century (Fig. 34). The series is expressed in four regis- ters. Beginning at the top the first one is a variation of the glyph shown earlier sig- nifying sprouting, consisting of a stalk, bud, and secondary branches. It is placed in an open space, like the cleared farmland of the village model, and like the openness of the physical world in the cosmological model. Its position at the top aligns it with the east. In the second register, a cluster of tri- angles refers to braided hair, as we saw earlier. Braided hair is analogous to cul- tivated fields, and, of course the Temne literally equate braiding (which they term "planting" in English) with the earth not only the term nb-ru, but also by C(((((C((((cX"( 34. SWORD, WITH DETAIL OF STAMPING. TEMNE, BONKOLENKEN CHIEFDOM, LATE 19TH CENTURY. IRON, IVORY, SILVER, 78cm. AUTHOR'S COLLECTION. their creation story, which specifies that the earth was placed on the head of the "great person," and "that the trees, and all the grass, and all things, which grow on this earth, are the hair of this great person" (Schlenker 1861: 12-15).) Here it appears as the foundation for the sprout, but it also follows immediately to the west, as the village follows the gardens, to suggest the equivalence of village and civilizing refinement. The zigzag line in the third register is the glyph for water, as mentioned ear- lier. Water is the place of crossing be- tween village and bush, and cosmologi- cally it divides life and death, ni-ru and ro-sbki. This register, therefore, is the di- vider between the upper and lower reg- isters of the cosmogram, the median point between conceptual east and west. The two rows of arcs that constitute the fourth register may be interpreted as moon crescents, suggesting the moon at its dimmest, at new moon. New moon, as we have seen, is first "dying" and then "new" as it first reappears, just as the initiates first die and then are reborn. The motif would correspond to the area of primeval Poro initiation forest in the west, in our village model, the area of dimness and invisibility, a closed world in contrast to that of the upper register. In the cosmogram it stands for the world of the spirits, the world of night and death. The serial image on the sword may be compared with another painted on the wall of a Temne Poro house (Fig. 35). Here the image consists of four motifs progressing horizontally, which should be read right to left, as one reads in Arabic, and as the Temne generally pro- ceed graphically. The first motif is obvi- ously the familiar sprout. The second is also a plant, but with mature leaves. The third, expressed almost parenthetically, is the sun, most logically the setting sun, although its association with the scrawled letters APC (Sierra Leone's sole political party at the moment) suggests that party's symbol, the rising sun. Perhaps the artist was not that politically astute, but in any case it is a transitional symbol. The fourth motif represents the sign am-pbor, constructed of sheaves of millet straw, bound in the middle and attached to the ends of twigs. This signifies a ne- gation. When placed in front of the Poro house, at the entrance to a farm, or in front of a tree, it means "no trespass- ing," and is recognized as a general ritual prohibitive. Two-dimensionally, the sheaves form an X shape or a pair of isos- celes triangles tangent at their apexes. This recalls the signs used on houses owned by evildoers or the insane, sig- nifying both danger and spiritual aliena- tion. Crossed lines are termed ptinki, which is probably cognate with pink, "not right, crazy, delirious." Crossed 42 ))))))))))</page><page sequence="16">36. WALL PAINTING DEPICTING A STYLIZED NOWO MASQUERADER (CENTER). MENDE, CA. 1935. FROM EBERL 1936: FIG. 6. lines suggest a barrier and its opposite side, as when they are marked on the bottom of a pot by the Gbandi and Mende to signify the death of an initiate (Schwab 1964: 24; Little 1967: 126). This progression of images seems to suggest again the four segments of birth in the east, maturing life in the village, death in the west, and the alienation of the afterlife. The sequence corresponds to that of the previous set: sprout; ma- ture plant=horticulture=braiding; transitional sun=water as a medium; and the sign of negation=the moon of death. "Cosmos," in our language, is cognate with the word "cosmetics." The use of cosmetics is an attempt to instill culture, to cultivate, to civilize, from the Greek kosmos, "order, form, ornament." For the Temne, civilizing order in "the place of braiding," no-ru, is indexed by the use of ornamenting design, such as cicatrization and fine patterns of hair braiding. Beauty is contingent upon one's manipulation of nature to pleasing effect. The mask of N6wo may be seen as an instrument and model of such re- finement, as the epitome of beauty and cultivation, engineered with meticulous regard to the principles of elemental harmony. Nowo's place in the cosmological cycle of transition is signified poignantly by the imagery of another wall painting, this one from the Mende, documented by Eberl (Fig. 36). Here the stylized image of N6wo is preceded on the right by the sprout (birth), and succeeded on the left by opposed triangles (death). Her position corresponds to that of the ma- ture plant and to the area of braiding (i.e., the village, real people, and the physical world) on the two previous suc- cessions of motifs. The mask of N6wo itself, as I have de- scribed, may be broken down into formal divisions. The importance of these divi- sions is revealed in the process of the carving of the mask by the Mende carver Moisi, as observed by Hommel (1974: 6): "Moisi marked what would become the center of the face along the length of the wood with his machete. From this center line he first roughed out a diamond shape and then proceeded to carve the face, hairstyle, and neck. Throughout the creative process he referred con- stantly to the original center line and to a horizontal line that intersected the center of the face so that all the elements would be balanced and symmetrical in relation to the center point." The central, hori- zontal line at the face is the line, in the round, that divides the base rings from the rest of the mask. We may compare the form of the mask of Nowo most favorably with the Temne cosmogram stamped into the sword shaft (Fig. 34). At the bottom.is the nota- tion I have interpreted as a representa- tion of lunar dimness, the male west, and ro-soki. Above this is the register containing the glyph for water, the mediating point between ro-sbki and no-ru. Here we find a comparison with the rings surrounding the base of the mask of Nowo, the lowest formal com- ponent (cf. Fig. 31). The next register up is that of triangular forms, or the glyph for the female cultivation of ni-ru, and for braiding, ru. This corresponds to the patterns of braiding above the face of the mask, the next formal component. At the top of the cosmological design is the glyph for sprouting. On the top of the mask of NOwo is the motif of hair lobes resembling this glyph in front elevation. In combination, other forms placed on the top of the head have been shown to refer also to concepts of sprouting and new growth. "Top," again, signifies "east." The head of N6wo, therefore, corres- ponds to the upper, or eastern, half of the cosmogram based upon a medium of water. In the ritual of initiation into adulthood, all life in the physical world is thought to develop from the medium of water in its passage from the spiritual world. Like the village in plan, the icon- ography of the mask refers to the female domain of positive transition in the east, to the gardens as the seed of ancestral re- generation, to the village as the site of human civilization, and to the descent of humankind from the world of the ances- tors via the path from the east. As the image of a human female, N6wo is an ancestral spirit to the Bondo/Sande. Perhaps the origin of the name is the Bullom no wu, "corpse," or "the deceased" (Pichl 1967: 80). Richards (1974:274; cf. Turay 1967: 53) says that the mask "ensures that every member of Sande has a claim of descent from a common ancestor or divine being which the mask (sowei) personalizes, and so members consider themselves to be cul- turally one family." To find the mask of Nowo, the Bondo official travels under the water, as the dead travel, to reach the realm of the spirits. Among the Temne the chief is the reincarnation of former chiefs. The chief presiding spirit of the Poro society is the reincarnation of the original founder of the association. The presiding spirit of Bondo is most cer- tainly also the reincarnation of a primor- dial ancestor (Eberl 1936: 330), the origi- nal black woman responsible for the maturing, the ritual metamorphosis, of the young. The Temne recognize that from the spirit of the dead, new life is germinated. Nowo is that chrysalid shell of the noble deceased from which new life will spring in the cultivating milieu of the village through the mediating force of women. a Notes, page 98 43 35. PORO HOUSE WALL PAINTING (DETAIL). TEMNE, YONI CHIEFDOM, 1980.</page><page sequence="17">supportive materials were a joy to the spe- cialist, and they did convey the nonlinear character of the arts. The organization of the show in ever-widening circles of the social web gave the viewer moorings for his thoughts and imagination. Igbo art of this quality, in my experience, has never before been assembled. The opportunity to study and compare great pieces is more than enough to recommend this exhibition. Add to this the plethora of extremely well-researched documentation, and one has at his disposal the compendium of Igbo arts. The show is at the Center for African Art, New York, until June 16, and will travel to the National Museum of African Art, Washing- ton, D.C. (July 31-Oct. 13); the Birmingham Museum of Art (Jan. 5-Mar. 2,1986), and the Seattle Art Museum (Apr. 10-June 15,1986).

Work on the Pedi has been undertaken by an- thropologists, and prior to that, missionaries and explorers, but no research as such has previously been done on their art. Most information for this study was collected through fieldwork in Sekhukhuneland between 1979 and 1984. The statistical population is defined as the people who are gov- erned by the chiefs directly descended from Sekhukhune I, the paramount chief who ruled during the 1860s. The sam- ple size constitutes an average of seven homesteads in nine of the seventeen villages ruled by these chiefs. I undertook investigative fieldwork in each of the nine villages. 2. Prior to the birth of the first child, the couple may live with the wife's family or, more commonly, in the home of the husband's mother. The husband and wife are consid- ered to have reached maturity legally, socially, and physi- cally with the arrival of their firstborn. 3. The definition of legal and social boundaries is con- stantly problematic for the Pedi and often arises as an issue in the village court. 4. The number of secondary courtyards can vary from one to as many as five or six depending on the age of the homestead and how many generations live there. Bi'bliography Bothma, C.V. 1969.

The research for this article was undertaken as part of the research for a doctoral thesis at the University of the Wit- watersrand. I wish to acknowledge the financial assistance received from the Human Sciences Research Council and the Ernest Oppernheimer Memorial Trust fund. 2. Space in this article allows for only a very brief outline of the anthropological background. The basic ethnographies are Stayt 1931a and Van Warmelo 1952. 3. The term Senzi is most correctly used to refer to the his- torical "founding heroes," while the term Singo refers to the wider royal class, defining their totem. 4. Blacking (1969) discusses the structure of Venda female initiation at great length in his series of four articles. 5. While the sisters of a chief may attain high status as Makhadzi (senior sister or great sister) to the chief or as headmen, and some Venda subgroups such as the Mbedzi have a tradition of female chiefship, these are exceptions to the subordinate status of women. Although a woman who has borne children may attain ancestral status on her death, her influence as an ancestor is secondary to that of her husband's line. 6. While Blacking's interpretation on the sexual level is substantiated by my informants, it is too narrow. 7. One can more fully appreciate the degree of multivalence if restrictive structuralist methodologies are not rigidly applied. 8. While a headman may, with the chief's consent, stage a Domba, the figures are most often made of unfired clay and destroyed at the close of the school. 9. As with the presentation of the other dzingoma, the girls are made to assume the position of submission, lying on their sides, their faces to the ground and covered by their arms. After the figures are brought out and set up, they are commanded to look up and are supposed to be astounded by the sudden appearance of the carvings in their midst. 10. One door of the tshivhambo admits initiates, the other admits the initiated, although some informants maintained that one was an entrance for the boys and the other for the girls attending the Domba. 11. Older informants insisted that the Tsonga should not be included, that this was a "modern" idea and that the Ngona were the rightful "owners" of the fourth door. The indusion of the Tsonga may thus represent an ipso-post- facto rationalization of a historical situation where the Tsonga, as vassals of the Venda chiefs, have for political reasons been subsumed into the Venda nation. 11. References to the groupings of senior men and women and junior men and women are also encountered in Shona divining tablets (makakata) with their implications of cos- mological symbolism (Nettleton 1984).

LAMP, notes, from page 43 My field research on the Temne Bondo association was conducted in 1979-80 under a grant from the Social Science Research Council, Fellowships for International Doctoral Research, and in 1976 under a grant from the National En- dowment for the Arts, Museum Professional Fellowship. I gratefully acknowledge their support. This study of Nowo is based upon a sample of approximately 900 masks. 1. For technical reasons, African Arts is unable to use the In- ternational Phonetic Alphabet in type. Therefore the fol- lowing substitutions are used here: a=the sign of the in- verted e, pronounced like the u in "untie," although more rapidly, like the i in "pistachio"; e=the open e, epsilon; b=the open o, pronounced like the "au" in "author"; ng=the nasal n, as in the French "avons." 2. See variations (Nowo/Nowi/Nowei/Nou) in Hall 1937: A133, 137, 140; Innes 1969: 117; Koelle 1854: 203; Schoen 1884: 118; Pichl 1967: 13; Eberl 1936: 325-29; Schwab 1947: 288. Alldridge (1901: 141) gave the name "Normeh," but I sus- pect that this is a typographical error for "Norweh"; he cited the term only once, and this spelling appears nowhere in other literature with the exception of Wallis (1903: 251: "normah"), who clearly plagiarized from Alldridge throughout his account of "Fetish and Supersti- tion" in The Advance of Our West African Empire. The use of the orthography or appears in much of the British litera- ture to indicate the sound given here throughout as o. Alldridge's spelling, and Eberl's (Nowi), employs the Mende definite ending ei for nouns ending in o in the inde- finite. The Vai use also the terms Zoba ("Great Leader") and Femba ("Great Thing"), and the Gola use the term Zogbe (Holsoe 1980: 97; Johnston 1906: 1032; d'Azevedo 1973:148). 3. Hall (1937: A137) recorded the appearance of ten masked Nowo dancers together. 4. Rosalind Shaw (personal communication) has learned this from diviners with whom she worked. One of the complications of duality, however, is that dyads may be re- versed in significance in situations of reversal. The diviner is human and male, but he transforms into spiritual mediator. It appears, for example, that in some cases, left and right as, respectively, positive and negative were re- versed in the case of some diviners, and the same was true for odd and even numbers (Shaw 1982). 5. Brilliance of color is related to physicality. However, the mixture of colorful patterns is termed gbengi, "gray," and is related to confounding effects and spiritual evasion. 6. Initiates in Bondo are painted white each time they ap- pear in public, to render them invisible. Invisible spirits are said among the Bullom to appear as a white glow just be- fore dawn (Hall 1938: 12). The world of the spirits is said by 98</page><page sequence="18">the Temne to be drab, gray, or colorless to the sight (Timothy 1952: 64). 7. These flaps represent literally the kind of hide flaps worn in four radiating directions around the neck by medical practitioners among the eastern Mende, Kissi, and Loma (cf. Fig. 19). 8. A Temne N6wo mask in the University Museum, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania, was collected in the field in 1924-25 (Fig. 25). Nowo is documented among the Vai as early as 1854 (Koelle: 203), although no illustration is given. There- fore I must revise my opinion given elsewhere (Lamp 1979: 37) on the recent development of the N6wo masquerade, although, still, the extensive absence of any mention of such a spirit (whom we know today to masquerade pub- licly and ubiquitously) in most nineteenth-century litera- ture suggests that we have, in the twentieth century, a phenomenon that is new in many respects. 9.He referred earlier to "griggory men" (i.e., gree-gree men, persons who work with charms), but his account is second-hand and perhaps this passage refers to a separate circumstance. 10. The Temne, like other groups, make clear distinctions between various types of serpents and snakes in nonritual contexts, but discussion of esoteric ritual is always clouded in ambiguity. Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine the type represented in each particular case and the peculiar significance attributed to each. 11. This is not, as Hommel says (1974: 11), evidence that the mask has been desanctified. I have seen several metal- ornamented masks in use, and others are illustrated in Johnston 1906, vol. 2: fig. 410; Gervis 1952: (end); Alldridge 1901: fig. 147. See also the description of Volz 1910: 57; and Ellis 1914: 54. 12. The model described here holds true most faithfully in small villages of less than twenty houses away from the motor roads. In larger towns the variance may be due to a broader range of competing concerns beyond those of the ritual societies, and, to some extent, the disintegration of traditional systems and the influence of Western education. For example, the gardens are sometimes placed at any point, with the strict exception of the west, if the Poro grove is there. The Bondo house is almost invariably in the east, although I found it in the north in two instances. In both of those instances, however, it had been moved re- cently from an older site in the east. The location of the Poro house was more irregular. In six out of eleven Poro villages that I mapped, it was within the western quadrant. One was in the north, but west of the Bondo house, which was in the northeast. One was in the northeast, in a village that had no Bondo house. Three were in the southern quadrant, although one of these was west of the old part of town, which has expanded since the establishment of the Por6 site. The location of three Poro houses in the south and a Bondo house in the north may be accounted for, in part, by a confusion that I occasionally found among edu- cated Temne between the traditional concept of a vertical east-west cartological axis and the European-designed map with its vertical north-south axis. For example, some said that the sun rose in the north and set in the south. In other words, the critical equation of up/down=beginnings/ends, seems now to have incorporated the new corollary, north/ south. Bibliography Alldridge, Thomas J. 1894.
