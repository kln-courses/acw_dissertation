Email: vbricker@tulane.edu Susan Milbrath Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida key words: Maya, Central Mexico, Codex Borgia, Madrid Codex, Calendars, Agricultural pests Despite differences in layout, the Lowland Maya planting almanacs on pages 24-31 of the Madrid Codex are structurally and iconographically similar to the almanacs on pages 27-28 of the Codex Borgia from highland Central Mexico. We compare the agricultural pests pictured in the two groups of almanacs , consider the seasonal variation in their feeding habits, relate them to the tonalpohualli/ tzolkin dates mentioned in the almanacs, and conclude that the temporal focus of the Madrid almanacs overlaps the years covered by the Borgia almanacs, which date to the fifteenth century (specifically 1467-1472, and more generally 1467-1519). The close thematic and chronological ties between the two sets of almanacs suggest that scribes in the two regions were communicating with each other and represent another facet of the spread of the Mixteca-Puebla tradition into the Maya area in Late Postclassic times. For recording the passage of time and anticipating what might happen in the future, the traditional cultures of Mesoamerica shared a ritual calendar of 260 days and a civil calendar of 365 days, the permutation of which resulted in a longer cycle of 18,980 days, or approximately 52 years. From this common base, they developed different notational systems that are well-documented in Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 67, 201 1 Copyright © by The University of New Mexico 497</page><page sequence="2">498 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH their screen-fold books known as codices. But neither the codices nor the people who consulted them remained in one place. The contents of codices produced in one region were sometimes of sufficient interest to people speaking a different language in another region that they were adapted for inclusion in one of their own books. Such is the case with many of the almanacs on pages 24-3 1 of the Madrid Codex, a Maya book, which have close thematic ties with the Central Mexican almanacs on pages 27-28 of Codex Borgia. The topic of common concern in the two sets of almanacs is maize agriculture, with a focus on pests and associated weather conditions that influence the size of the harvest. The production of maize was a cornerstone of civilization in both regions, and that it received attention in their writings is not surprising. But the elevation and topography of Central Mexico and the Yucatan peninsula are so different that it is surprising that almanacs on this subject produced in one region would have been considered worth emulating in the other, especially because of the inherent difficulties in adapting the calendrical notational system of one culture to that of another. Nevertheless, this is exactly what happened, and the solution chosen reveals not only that accommodations were made to account for local environmental conditions in the lowlands, but also that a number of Madrid almanacs were tailored for the same years as those in Codex Borgia. In other words, it is possible to place some of the Madrid almanacs in historical time by cross-dating them with the more securely dated almanacs in Codex Borgia. The close thematic and chronological parallels between the two sets of almanacs also suggest that communication and cooperation must have occurred between the scribes of the two regions, transcending substantial differences in culture and language, and serve as another example of the spread of the Mixteca-Puebla tradition into the Maya area in Late Postclassic times. The links between the Codex Borgia and the Madrid Codex documented in a volume edited by Gabrielle Vail and Anthony Aveni (2004) include structural similarities between several agricultural almanacs in the two codices. Here we focus on the agricultural pests represented in these codices, their habits, and the times during the growing season for maize when they are most likely to be active. Although the Central Mexican highlands and the northern lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula differ greatly in elevation, their tropical latitude is similar (about 20° N), and the growing season in both areas runs from May through October. Fall armyworms are the only maize pests featured in both codices. Locusts and rats are the other pests that receive attention in Codex Borgia; although these insects and rodents are also agricultural pests in the Maya lowlands (Perez Toro 1942:23-25), the Madrid Codex focuses instead on other mammals (raccoons, opossums, deer, and peccaries) and birds (grackles). CENTRAL MEXICAN CALENDRICAL NOTATION In order to understand the dates associated with the visual images representing the agricultural pests better, a brief excursion into the Mesoamerican calendar systems is necessary. The ritual calendar of 260 days was called the tonalpohualli ("day count" in the Nahuatl language) of Central Mexico. It was composed of two</page><page sequence="3">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 499 smaller cycles, one with numbers from 1 to 13 and the other with 20 day names used in a constant order, as shown in Table 1. The full tonalpohualli date was a permutation of day number and day name. The cycle began with 1 Crocodile. The next day was 2 Wind, the day after that was 3 House, continuing until day 13 with 13 Reed, and day 14 was 1 Ocelot, and so on, ending with 13 Flower. Table 1.

Xochitl Flower Ahau The Central Mexican year of 365 days was called xihuitl in Nahuatl. It was divided into 18 periods of 20 days each and a much shorter 5-day period called nemontemi (nameless days) that completed the 3 65 -day year. The permutation of the 365 days of the xihuitl with the 260 days of the tonalpohualli resulted in a cycle of 18,980 days, or ca. 52 solar years, known as the xiuhmolpilli ("binding of the years" in Nahuatl). The years in the xiuhmolpilli were named after the tonalpohualli date of the 360th day of the year (Caso 1967:48^49, 1971). If, for example, the 360th day was 1 Reed, then the year leading up to it was known as "year 1 Reed." It was followed by the years 2 Flint, 3 House, 4 Rabbit, 5 Reed, and so on. The four days Reed, Flint, House, and Rabbit were called "yearbearers" because they were the only days in the 20-day sequence that could name the year. As will be seen, the four yearbearers in Codex Borgia also have directional associations. Individual days in the 52-year cycle were specified by first naming the year (e.g., 1 Reed) followed by the name of the day (e.g., 1 Crocodile). Because the year was 105 days longer than the tonalpohualli (365 - 260 = 105), the names of the first 1 05 days of the year were repeated during the last 1 05 days of the year.</page><page sequence="4">500 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH As a result, there were two days named 1 Crocodile in years named 1 Reed, the later one falling 260 days after the first (Caso 1 97 1 : Table 4). Only the middle 155 days of the year could be specified uniquely. LOWLAND MAYA CALENDRICAL NOTATION The Lowland Maya counterpart of the Central Mexican tonalpohualli is known as the tzolkin (literally, "count day") among scholars. It, too, consists of a cycle of numbers from 1 to 13 that serve as coefficients for a sequence of 20 day names, which are listed in the third column of Table 1. The haab was the Lowland Maya counterpart of the Central Mexican xihuitl. It is divided into 18 periods of 20 days plus a short, intercalary period of only 5 days, called "nameless days" ( xma kaba kin). Each "month" of the year has a name (Table 2) that is used for locating the tzolkin days in the year. The permutation of the tzolkin with the haab results in the 52-year period of 1 8,980 days, which has no name in Maya but is referred to as the "calendar round" by scholars. The days in the first 1 8 months of the year were numbered from 1 to 20 during the late fifteenth century and afterward (and Uayeb at year's end from 1 to 5), and the month and its coefficients were paired with the day and its coefficient in the tzolkin (e.g., 5 Cauac 1 Pop). This notation is known as a "calendar-round permutation." In addition to noting the position of a day in the year, such expressions specify its position in the 52-year cycle. For example, there is only one 5 Cauac 1 Pop day among the 18,980 days in the calendar round. In this respect, the Maya calendrical notation was more precise than the one used in Central Mexico, where the placement of 105 days in each year was ambiguous. Table 2. "Months" of the Maya haab. 1.

The four yearbearers that are relevant to the Madrid Codex discussed in this article were Kan, Muluc, Ix, and Cauac. The years beginning on these days had both directional and color associations: Kan with south and yellow, Muluc with east and red, Ix with north and white, and Cauac with west and black. CLIMATE CYCLES AND AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN THE CODEX BORGIA 27-28 The Codex Borgia was probably produced in Tlaxcala in Central Mexico, and it apparently uses the Aztec system of dating, with the xiuhmolpilli beginning with the year 1 Reed. Because the xiuhmolpilli covers a period of only 52 years, its placement in historical time must be determined from other kinds of data. Following the lead of Anthony Aveni (1999), we have used codical references to astronomical events for correlating the xiuhmolpilli dates on Borgia 27-28 with</page><page sequence="5">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 501 a period running from 1467 to 1519 (Bricker 2001; Milbrath n.d.), and Christine Hernandez (2004, 2006) has focused attention on the agricultural cycle suggested by the images on page 27, using information from ethnohistorical sources to confirm the placement of dates. More recently, Woolley and Milbrath (2011) have corroborated the placement of the xiuhmolpilli dates in 1467-1519 on Borgia 27 using climate records derived from tree-ring data and Central Mexican ethnohistorical sources recording preconquest droughts, floods, and agricultural plagues that took place during the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the period that is most likely associated with the Codex Borgia. They also see evidence of agricultural pests on Borgia 28, which covers a shorter period (1467-1472). The two-page sequence of dates begins in the lower right corner of Borgia 27 with the year date 1 Reed paired with the tonalpohualli date 1 Crocodile (Figures 1 and 2). Because the tonalpohualli cycle is only 260 days long, 105 of the days appear twice during any given year. The xiuhmolpilli date on Borgia 27 beginning the sequence in 1467 (1 Reed 1 Crocodile) could be the March 26, 1467, date (Julian, or April 4, 1467, in the Gregorian calendar) that several scholars have proposed (Aveni 1999; Bricker 2001; Hernandez 2004: Table 1 1.2, 2006). Alternatively, the date could be December 11, 1467 (Julian; December 20, 1467, Gregorian), which is the second occurrence of 1 Crocodile in the year 1 Reed (Milbrath n.d.). Because the date in March would precede planting by several months, the imagery of locusts and rats attacking the mature maize seems more appropriate for a date at the end of the growing season for maize (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1). Therefore, the second occurrence of 1 Crocodile in the year 1 Reed is the better candidate. If all four dates on Borgia 27 refer to the second occurrence of the tonalpohualli dates in the year, the sequence of Gregorian dates would be December 20, 1467, for 1 Reed 1 Crocodile; December 16, 1480, for 1 Flint 1 Death; December 13, 1493, for 1 House 1 Monkey; and December 11, 1506, for 1 Rabbit 1 Vulture.1 The xiuhmolpilli cycle, divided into 13-year intervals, would be completed in 15 19 by returning the year to 1 Reed 1 Crocodile again in the lower right corner of Borgia 27. Confirmation for dating the scenes to the end of the rainy season can also be found in the imagery on this page (Figure 1). The rain is shown as torrential in all the images, but the condition of maize is different in each picture. The images in the upper right and lower left corners, dated to the years 1 Flint (1480) and 1 Rabbit (1506), respectively, depict damaged ears of maize (Figure 2). The maize in the picture in the lower right corner, dated to the year 1 Reed (1467), appears healthy, whereas the picture in the upper left corner, dated to the year 1 House (1493), shows rainfall inundating the crops, which are partially covered by water represented by blue bands with undulating lines. By correlating tree-ring data with known maize yields for 1980-2001 and estimating the preconquest yields from early tree-ring data, Therrell et al. (2006a, 2006b) have determined that the total rainfall was well above average in the year 1 House (1493). This is the first year in the third quadrant of the xiuhmolpilli beginning in 1467. The link between heavy rain in the climate records and the inundation on Borgia 27 shown in the year 1 House in 1493 helps confirm that the xiuhmolpilli cycle began in 1467 in the year 1 Reed (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1).</page><page sequence="6">502 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 1. The almanac on Borgia 27. (Drawing by Christine Hernandez, after Codex Borgia 1976:27) Geologists define weather as a daily atmospheric state - whether it is rainy, windy, hot, or cold - whereas climate is defined as a 30-year average of weather for specific seasons of the year; therefore, it is the "expected weather." The weather patterns mentioned in Aztec pictorial annals and historical chronicles span more than 52 years (Boone 2000), and in the Codex Borgia we have records of weather patterns over a 52-year period, so clearly these qualify as climate records. There is clear evidence that some years were believed to be associated with recurring patterns, such as the droughts associated with 1 Rabbit years by the Aztecs (Therrell et al. 2004). The thirteen droughts reported in the ethnohistorical sources studied by Therrell et al. (2004: fig. 3) seem to follow a pattern reminiscent of the El Nino oscillation, with significantly above-normal growth for maize four years prior to the Aztec drought years (Woolley and Milbrath 2011). Although the data are not yet conclusive, Therrell and his colleagues found the evidence for a drought in the 1 Rabbit years sufficiently compelling to include that year in a list of droughts, but they placed the drought event in 1505 rather than 1506</page><page sequence="7">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 503 Figure 2. Dates corresponding to the pictures in the almanac on Borgia 27. (Drawing by Christine Hernandez, after Codex Borgia 1976:27) (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1). In fact, ethnohistorical sources specifically mention drought and famine associated with 1 Rabbit in the years from 1505 to 1506 and 52 years earlier in 1453-1454 (Duran 1994:238; Quinones Keber 1995:217, 228-229). The 1 506 drought seems to coordinate with a drought image in the year 1 Rabbit pictured in the lower left corner of Borgia 27 (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1), providing further corroboration for the placement of the 52-year cycle in 1467-1519. Codex Borgia 27 Each of the four corners of Borgia 27 features the rain god Tlaloc, from whose outstretched hands torrents of rain and maize cobs fall, and another stream of rain emerges from between his legs (Figure 1). Each Tlaloc wears a different headdress and has different body paint: black for the 1 Reed year representing the east, yellow for the 1 Flint year representing the north, blue for the 1 House year to the west, and red for the 1 Rabbit year to the south (Figure 2). Each Tlaloc holds a</page><page sequence="8">504 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH vessel or insignia with Tlaloc features in one hand and a bent serpent in the other, which is a symbol of lightning in a number of contexts in Mesoamerica (Miller and Taube 1993: 106). The sky bands in the four pictures around the central scene are clearly intended to show weather patterns. Two depict sunny skies, and two represent cloudy conditions, with one apparently also referencing a starry sky with clouds (lower right), suggesting nocturnal rains. The four scenes surrounding the central image on Borgia 27 also have different baseline images with subtle differences in the representations of maize (see below). The central scene is similar to those in the four corners, but twin goddesses facing the central stream of water replace the maize crop on the baseline. They may represent Tlaloc's spouse, the water goddess Chalchiuhtlicue, in double form. There is a night sky band with stars and knives overhead, and in the center a half solar disk is joined to a half circle of darkness covered with stars, possibly representing dusk, based on Seler's (1963 [2]: 147, 151, 154) interpretation of other sections of the codex. Of the dated scenes in the four corners of page 27, only one shows ideal conditions for maize (Figure 2). This is the scene associated with the year 1 Reed (1467) in the lower right corner, where a cloudy night sky and the rain god Tlaloc send down rain with bountiful ears of maize, and tasseled maize cobs sprout from the back of a crocodilian earth monster in the baseline. The second scene, in the upper right corner, dating to 13 years later, depicts a sunny sky and locusts attacking maize in the year 1 Flint (1480). Here Tlaloc sends rain with ears of maize that have chunks removed, indicating that they have been partially consumed by locusts. A flying locust grasps a maize cob that has been split open, and he feeds on the maize, a scene repeated below in the baseline, where the maize sprouts from small oval earth bands, two colored yellow and black, and one in the center holding a puddle of water. The scene in the year 1 House (1493; upper left corner) depicts a cloudy sky and too much water, with the maize partially inundated. The final scene (in the lower left corner) shows a sunny sky in the year 1 Rabbit and rodents attacking the maize sprouting from parched earth that indicates drought conditions. Although the actual maize is similar in size in the four scenes on page 27, the attendant conditions affecting the crops are clearly differentiated. Focusing on the imagery associated with agricultural pests, we begin with the scene representing a group of locusts in the year 1 Flint on Borgia 27. When rain is sufficient for the breeding of grasshoppers but is later insufficient for nurturing the crops that provide their food supply, it stimulates swarming behavior that transforms them into locusts (Schistocerca piceifrons). The range of these insects extends from Central Mexico south to Peru. Permanent populations from which swarms originate are known from the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, the Rio Aguan valleys in Honduras, and the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico (Centre for Overseas Pest Research 1982:302-5). Plagues occur when the swarms migrate out of the permanent breeding areas, after they have exhausted their food supply. They prefer lower elevations (below 1 00 m) but have been observed at much higher ones. Plagues in the Maya area are known to have spread to the rest of Mesoamerica, including Central Mexico (Garcia Quintanilla 2005:327). Locusts are included with droughts, floods, and early frosts as natural disasters that devastated the Mexica (Aztecs) in preconquest times (Chimalpahin 1998; see</page><page sequence="9">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 505 Codex Telleriano-Remensis, n.d.: fols. 29v^4r in Quinones Keber 1995). The Codex Mexicanus says that a plague of locusts devoured the crops in the year 12 Reed (Mengin 1952:456), and an outbreak of locusts in 1446 and 1488 is documented in Las Ocho Relaciones y el Memorial de Colhuacan II (Chimalpahin 1998:85, 131). Central Mexican ethnohistorical sources also mention a number of locust plagues during the early colonial period, such as the ones documented in the Codex Aubin of 1576, which describes locust plagues spaced 43 and 67 years apart (Dibble 1963). Locusts actually appear during years when rain is plentiful and permits the production of two generations of insects. Mating and egg-laying generally occur at the beginning of the spring rains (May in Yucatan and Central Mexico). After some weeks the eggs hatch; the adults appear in July, becoming mature in September, when they lay a second batch of eggs that hatch in October. This generation reaches adulthood in late December to early January, during the dry season, but they do not lay eggs until the onset of the rains in April or May (Centre for Overseas Pest Research 1982:303). As the vegetation becomes increasingly scarce, the lack of food can trigger swarming or gregarious behavior that culminates in a long-distance search for suitable vegetation, sometimes extending into drought-stricken areas. Schistocerca piceifrons survives the winter dry season in the adult stage. Because the 1 Flint date in the upper right corner on Borgia 27 corresponds to December 1480, the picture associated with it could represent a locust swarm at the beginning of the dry season in December of that year (Figure 2). The year 1480 was relatively wet compared with the two previous years, providing the conditions suited to locust swarms (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1). The pool of water in that picture could be a sign of past rains, but the sunny sky overhead indicates that the rains have ceased, indicating dry conditions that could trigger swarming. The last dated image on Borgia 27, corresponding to 1506 (1 Rabbit), is a clear representation of drought, showing the ground completely dry with matted grass the color of straw. Here the maize is being consumed by what appear to be rats or field mice. A comparable plague of rodents in the year 1 Rabbit is depicted for the same year (1506) on folio 41 v in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis, where one commentator notes that the rats devoured the seeds at night during that year (Quinones Keber 1 995 :228-29). The same source mentions that there was a famine in the previous year (13 House, 1505), presumably leaving the rats without stored maize to consume and causing them to dig up freshly planted seeds. The famine in 1506 repeated events that occurred 52 years earlier in 1454, which was also a year 1 Rabbit. Indeed, the Aztecs had long associated 1 Rabbit years with famine, and there is some evidence for drought in 1 Rabbit years, or the year immediately preceding them, according to paleoclimatic records (Therrell et al. 2004:1269). Codex Borgia 28 The scenes on Borgia 28, with five images of Tlaloc sending rain, resemble the ones on Borgia 27, but here the sequence of yearbearers runs from 1 Reed to 5 Reed, indicating a five-year period (Figures 3 and 4). Although the first year sign is effaced in the lower right (Figure 3), it must have been 1 Reed, for the sequence</page><page sequence="10">506 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH of recorded dates that follow are 2 Flint, 3 House, 4 Rabbit, and 5 Reed (Figure 4). The tonalpohualli dates accompanying the year dates are well preserved in the codex for the years 2 Flint, 3 House, and 5 Reed, but some of the other dates that are partly effaced must be reconstructed by comparing them with the ones that are legible. Hernandez (2004, 2006) identified patterns in the dates that are preserved that helped her restore the missing dates (compare Figures 3 and 4). As on Borgia 27, Tlaloc is shown in all five compartments on page 28, but here two sets of day signs accompany each yearbearer, with the year marked by the trapeze-and-ray sign in the best-preserved examples (Figure 3). The dates for all the images on Borgia 28 fall in May, June, or July, according to the sequence proposed by Hernandez (2004:337, Table 1 1.6). The first represented date seems to be 1 Reed 5 Movement (May 30, 1467). The second date on the lower right is reconstructed by Hernandez (2004) as 1 Reed 9 Deer, or June 29, 1467. In all cases, the first set of tonalpohualli dates in the compartments on page 28 fall in the last two weeks of May and the second set in June or early July, which means that they occur only once during the year. Figure 3. The almanac on Borgia 28. (Drawing by Christine Hernandez, after Codex Borgia 1976:28)</page><page sequence="11">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 507 The five scenes on Borgia 28 highlight minor variations in the type of rainfall, but the yellow and black earth bands are similar. The 1 Reed year (1467) is pictured with rain marked by flint knives cutting open the young maize ears, suggesting hail or lightning storms (Figure 4, lower right; Hernandez 2006:20). In the next year (2 Flint, 1468; upper right), red-spotted volutes on the rain and on the maize itself may represent frost or fungal spores, whereas in the year 3 House (1469; upper left), flame symbols in the rain and on the maize suggest overly dry conditions (Hernandez 2006:20; Woolley and Milbrath 201 1). Abundant rain is implied for the year 4 Rabbit (1470; lower left), but here the crop is attacked by worm-like creatures that probably represent fall armyworms (Woolley and Milbrath 2011). In the central compartment, the streams of rain are embellished with flowers, apparently indicating that the rainfall in 5 Reed (1471) was ideal for producing a bountiful maize crop. Unfortunately, the most likely European dates for those years (1467-1471) predate the available climate records, which begin in 1474, when the paleoclimate record is based on only a few trees, in contrast to the much richer arboreal records available for later decades (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1). Figure 4. Dates corresponding to the pictures in the almanac on Borgia 28. (Drawing by Christine Hernandez, after Codex Borgia 1976:28)</page><page sequence="12">508 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH In the valleys of the Central Highlands, maize is planted between late April and early June, when the rains begin, and it is harvested from late October through November and December. At higher elevations, where rain showers begin as early as February, maize can be planted in February (Broda 1983:150- 51). The young maize attributed to the month of Hueytozoztli (during May) in ethnohistorical sources may be the irrigated crop, according to Johanna Broda (1983:151-53), but it is also possible that this early maize was the crop planted in the mountains and nurtured by high-elevation rains during February, long before the seasonal rains began in May at lower elevations (Milbrath n.d.). Duran (1971:430) says that the rain began to fall copiously during the month of Etzalcualiztli in June, and the maize was "half grown and already bearing ears." Broda (1983:154) notes that during Etzalcualiztli, the main valley crop had started to mature, and the seasonal rains were well established. By October, during the festival of Tepeihuitl, the harvest had begun, and the rainy season was coming to a close (Broda 1989:141). During the dry season, the harvest continued through the festival of Atemoztli in December. The pest image in the lower left corner on Borgia 28 that is associated with the year 4 Rabbit illustrates the caterpillar phase of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptra: Noctuidae), commonly known as the fall armyworm, which thrives during wet years and often attacks maize (Woolley and Milbrath 2011). Windblown eggs mature into armyworm caterpillars that then pupate in cocoons and emerge as moths with a wingspan of up to 40 mm (Capinera 2001:403-7). The larvae (caterpillars) are usually brownish with dark, elevated spots bearing spines. They are a problem in maize fields between April and December. Young larvae eat only the leaves on the maize plant, but as they mature the larvae feed on maize kernels, burrowing through the husk on the side of the ear. They can be so destructive that they leave only the ribs and stalks of the plant (Capinera 2001:406-7). Sahagun (1963:97) describes similar feeding habits for the cinocuillin, which seem to be the creatures shown in the picture in the lower left corner of Borgia 28. The color of the brown "worms" on Borgia 28 is similar to that of the fall armyworm, but they have the face of Ehecatl, the wind god, a detail that may symbolize the fact that the fall armyworm is distributed in windblown eggs (Woolley and Milbrath 2011). The Ehecatl worms have round markings that represent stars, possibly simultaneously evoking the spotted markings on the armyworm and the nocturnal habits of the moths they represent. Because the dates on Borgia 28 cluster in May and June, the worms in this image could represent an early outbreak of the worms attacking young valley maize in one of these months (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1). The importance of maize pests in the rainfall scenes on both Borgia 27 and 28 is a sure indication that the people of Central Mexico were tracking the different kinds of agricultural pests in relation to changes in weather. They seem not only to have been documenting actual conditions during a period spanning the years from 1467 to 1519, but also perhaps predicting the specific weather patterns that would be associated with crop infestations. Thus, the almanacs may combine both records of short-term weather and predictions about climate over a longer period of time, because certain patterns were expected to recur, such as the droughts of 1 Rabbit years that made this an ominous year in terms of future prognostications.</page><page sequence="13">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 509 ALMANACS IN THE MADRID CODEX DEPICTING AGRICULTURAL PESTS Hernandez and Bricker (2004) have pointed out that several almanacs in the planting section on pages 24-3 1 of the Madrid Codex are structurally and iconographically similar to the almanac on Borgia 27 and that, in two cases (Madrid 31a and 31b), the beginning dates of the almanacs (13 Chicchan and 13 Ahau) fall just one day before the tonalpohualli dates associated with the compartments on the right side of Borgia 27 (1 Death [= 1 Cimi] and 1 Crocodile [= 1 Imix]) (Figure 5, right). The date 1 Cimi is the day after 13 Chicchan, and 1 Imix is the day after 13 Ahau. Hernandez and Bricker did not make further calendrical comparisons between the Madrid almanacs and Borgia 27 because they did not know how to relate the black bar-and-dot numbers in the Madrid almanacs (which normally represent day intervals) to the implicit 13-year intervals in the corresponding Borgia almanac. However, they did mention similarities between the layout of Madrid 31a and Borgia 27-28 (pictures in each of the four corners of the page and the center) and the depiction of the rain god Chac in both Madrid 3 la and 3 lb, as well as the representation of rain in all five pictures in Madrid 31a (a page with upper and lower registers designated as "a" and "b" following standard conventions). In the meantime, Vail (2002, 2004, 2006, 2009) has shown that the black bar- and-dot numbers in codical almanacs do not always refer to intervals composed of days; because they are not associated with period glyphs, they could just as well refer to other time periods, such as years (haab). This insight has made it possible to pursue the comparison of Madrid 31b with Borgia 27 further and to extend the calendrical comparison to other almanacs in the planting section of the Madrid Codex. Madrid 31b contains four sets of black bar-and-dot numbers, all with the value "13" (two bars and three dots) (Figure 5, lower right). If these intervals referred to 13 years instead of 13 days, then the full length of the almanac would have been 52 years (4 x 13), which is the same period covered by Borgia 27. This suggests that there may be an even tighter relationship between Madrid 3 1 b and Borgia 27 than originally proposed by Hernandez and Bricker (2004). The Madrid almanac replicates the calendrical structure of Borgia 27 but represents the rain god only once, rather than five times. Madrid 30a resembles the almanac on Madrid 31b in format, iconography, and calendrical structure, but its beginning date - 1 1 Ahau - is different (Figure 5, upper left). If the four sets of black bar-and-dot numbers (all "13": two bars and three dots) also refer to years instead of days, then the length of this almanac is also 52 years. It could refer to a different set of years in the same calendar round, when the event pictured on Madrid 30a coincided with the date 1 1 Ahau at the top of the column on the left side and three other tzolkin dates at intervals of 13 years - 1 1 Chicchan, 1 1 Oc, and 1 1 Men - which are reconstructed based on the repeated red coefficient of 1 1 (shown outlined in black in Figure 5) arrayed around the page and paired with the 13-year intervals shown in black. On the other hand, page 31b shows a scene corresponding to 13 Ahau (on the left side of the page) and continuing with 13 Chicchan, 13 Oc, and 13 Men, dates that are</page><page sequence="14">5 1 0 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH c » « • £ $ ^ &lt;D -C X tn vo 61) p U O O oo Plh O O jS O ^ m &gt; #k&gt; oo t&gt; t, m 5 &gt; #k&gt; Z. oo &lt;M 3 ^ S "3 D H M ^ as ct; e3 £r E ^ ® S ^ &lt; -2 E ^ en ^ o- &lt; U</page><page sequence="15">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 5 1 1 reconstructed based on the red tzolkin coefficients of 13 paired with the 13-year intervals in black arrayed around the page. The layout of the almanacs on Madrid 31b and 30a, with a picture in the center and pairs of black and red bar-and-dot numbers scattered over it, is one of several formats in the Madrid Codex. On other pages (Madrid 24-28), there may be three or even four registers (a-c or a-d), where the almanacs are divided into multiple compartments laid out horizontally in a single row, each containing a picture, a hieroglyphic caption, and pairs of bar-and-dot numbers. The black bar- and-dot numbers represent intervals that are paired with red coefficients of the tzolkin days reached by adding the number of days (or years) in the interval to the previous tzolkin day in the sequence (e.g., Figure 6a, b). Read from left to right, this format, the most common one in the Maya codices, contrasts with the layout of compartments on Borgia 27-28, which occupy the corners and the center of those pages and implicate a counter-clockwise rather than left-to-right reading order (Figures 1-4). Four planting almanacs with the standard layout in the Madrid Codex have the same intervalic structure (multiple black bar-and-dot numbers representing 13) and iconographic themes that are similar to those on Borgia 27. In Madrid 27c-28c, maize plants are personified by the maize god sitting on the glyph for "earth" in pictures 1 , 2, 3, and 5 (Figure 6b). Pictures 1 and 5 have almost identical themes, in both cases showing the maize god holding a seed; the only difference is that the seed in picture 5 is represented by a maize glyph, whereas picture 1 depicts an ik glyph held by the maize god, a likely reference to a chili pepper seed (ic in Yucatecan Maya) (see below). In the remaining pictures in the almanac, the maize god is under attack by pests: a black bird (in picture 2), a mammal with a bare tail (in picture 3), and a worm or caterpillar with black spots (in picture 4). They are also named in the corresponding captions above the pictures (in columns designated by letters from left to right), by a bird head at C2, a mammalian head with two maize seeds in its mouth at F2-G2, and the head of the worm at 12, which is incongruently shown with teeth but is otherwise very similar in markings and color to the full-figure worm in the picture below. The eye of the maize god in the second picture is closed, indicating that he is dead, having been destroyed by the bird. The last image of the maize god is not under attack, and the scene shows a positive outcome, with the alert maize god holding up the glyph for maize. The almanac on Madrid 27c-28c begins on the day 13 Muluc; the other dates in the almanac reached by the sequence of five 13-year intervals are 13 Ix, 13 Cauac, and 1 3 Kan, returning to 1 3 Muluc after 52 years. The coefficients of these days are indicated by the two red bars surmounted by three red dots that follow the references to 1 3 (years), and the complete dates are listed in the column on the left side of the almanac. The 13-year intervals of this almanac echo the structure of the almanac on Borgia 27, and the scenes of animals attacking the maize god call to mind the locusts and rats attacking maize plants in the second and fourth compartments of Borgia 27. The same trio of pests seen on Madrid 27c-28c shows up again in the almanac on Madrid 24d (Figure 7a). In the first picture, a small mammal looks on as the rain god uses his digging stick for planting seeds, represented by the small circles</page><page sequence="16">5 1 2 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH cj 00 3 r- &lt;N 00 r- o (N oo 2 ^ Z1 00 SRi * |S o ^ U f2 ? o •S s i! -O S a £ w 7 § r- o &lt;N O iS &lt;u 60 C cd ►&gt; Oh Vh gl 03 ^ 03 ^ 3 § s *03 t/3 &lt;L&gt; a, vb &lt;L&gt; 5 op s</page><page sequence="17">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 5 1 3 falling from his outstretched hand. The maize god is attacked by spotted worms or caterpillars in the second picture and by a black bird in the third. The attack by the black bird seems to have been fatal, because the maize god's eye is closed, as on Madrid 28c (Figure 6b). The rain god reappears in the fourth picture wielding his digging stick and seeds, and the maize glyph at II in the caption above the picture suggests a more favorable outcome for the crop. The intervals separating the pictures are once again 1 3 years, linking the dates 3 Caban, 3 Ik, 3 Manik, and 3 Eb, represented only by the number 3 (three red dots) repeated as coefficients without day signs, following the standard format for horizontal rows of dates seen in the Madrid Codex. The last of the four 13-year intervals returns the almanac to the first picture in the row (and 3 Caban). Unlike in the previously considered almanac on Madrid 27c-28c, the dates reached by adding intervals of 1 3 years to 3 Caban are not mentioned in the column of tzolkin dates at the beginning of the almanac on Madrid 24d (Figure 7a). The dates listed below 3 Caban are 3 Muluc, 3 Imix, 3 Ben, and 3 Chicchan, not 3 Ik, 3 Manik, and 3 Eb. In this respect, the year interpretation of the intervals is not compatible with the traditional format of Maya codical almanacs, which was nevertheless retained without modification when they were used for calculating year intervals. Only two pests appear in the third almanac in the set, on Madrid 27b-28b, where the rain god Chac wields a digging stick in four pictures (Figure 6a). In the first, he is clearly planting maize seeds (represented by a maize glyph). In the second, a black bird is pecking at the seed he is trying to plant. The seeds have already sprouted in the remaining pictures, where foliage emerges from maize glyphs. A small mammal with a bushy tail is attacking the sprouting maize in the third picture. Nothing is interfering with Chac's planting in the fourth picture. The almanac tracing the fate of the maize crop begins on the day 3 Ik. After 1 3 years, the date reached is 3 Manik, followed by 3 Eb 13 years later, and 3 Caban 13 years after that. The three red dots above the intervals refer to the coefficients for these days. The last of the four 13-year intervals returns the almanac to the first picture in the row (and 3 Ik). Once again, our model accounts for only the first of the five tzolkin days in the column at the beginning of the almanac; the dates 3 Ix, 3 Cimi, 3 Edznab, and 3 Oc are apparently nonfunctioning vestiges of the standard treatment of intervals as days, rather than years. The last almanac containing multiple intervals of 13 appears on Madrid 25d (Figure 7b). The maize god shows up in three pictures; only in the second one is he being attacked (by a spotted worm). There is no evidence of planting in this almanac. It begins on 3 Lamat, and the implied tzolkin dates at 13-year intervals in the other compartments are 3 Ben, 3 Edznab, and 3 Akbal, whose coefficients are given as three red dots following the intervals. As with the almanacs on Madrid 24d and 27b-28b, the introductory column contains other dates that are apparently not clear references to subdivisions of the 52-year cycle. On page 25d, the introduction records 3 Lamat with 3 Ahau, 3 Eb, 3 Kan, and 3 Cib just below. These are not the only almanacs containing pictures of pests attacking maize seeds or plants in realistic or personified form, but they are the only ones with the multiple intervals of 13 that tie them most closely to Borgia 27. We will consider</page><page sequence="18">5 1 4 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 7. Pest and planting almanacs on pages 24d, 25d, and 28d of the Madrid Codex. (a) M.24d. (b) M.25d. (c) M.28d. (After Villacorta C. and Villacorta 1976:272, 274, 280) the other almanacs with similar iconography after exploring at greater length the relationship between the Borgia almanacs and their closest counterparts in the Madrid Codex. Of the seven Madrid almanacs we have considered so far, six have repeating intervals of 13 years that mimic the calendrical structure of Borgia 27. This is five more almanacs than necessary to accomplish the same task, a discrepancy that requires explanation. The answer lies in Borgia 28 and the Madrid almanac that resembles it most closely, the one almanac in this group that does not have</page><page sequence="19">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 5 1 5 repeating intervals of 13 years. That almanac is the one on Madrid 31a, whose entry date (13 Chicchan) is one day before 1 Death (1 Cimi), the tonalpohualli date in the upper-right compartment of Borgia 27 (Figure 5, upper right). It mimics the layouts of both Borgia almanacs more closely than other almanacs in the Madrid Codex, with its pictures of frogs in the rain in the four corners and of the rain god in the center. At first glance, its intervals are anomalous: seven intervals of 5 (a solid black bar), a possible interval of 6 (the dot above the bar is partially effaced), and an interval of 13, for a total of 53 or 54, rather than the expected sum of 52. The almanac on Borgia 28 covers a period of five years, beginning in the lower right-hand corner with a year 1 Reed (Figure 4), which may be the same year 1 Reed that is mentioned in the lower-right compartment on Borgia 27 (Figure 2). The intervalic structure of almanacs in the Maya codices does not accommodate comparable periods of time (Aveni et al. 1995, 1996). The Madrid intervals must sum to 26, 52, 65, or 130 days (or years). One way of handling this problem is to have multiple intervals of five years whose total approximates 52 years. This, then, seems to have been the function of Madrid 31a, with its seven or eight intervals of five years approximating three quarters of a calendar round (39 years) and the last quarter represented by an interval of 13 years (Figure 5, upper right). These five-year intervals echo the references to five sequential years on Borgia 28, and the 39-year interval is also seen on Borgia 27, when counting from the first to the last date (1 Reed to 1 Rabbit). The multiplicity of almanacs employing four or five intervals of 13 years in the Madrid Codex suggests the use of still another strategy for modifying the Borgia 28-style almanac to the format used in Maya almanacs, namely the creation of separate almanacs to represent different years and multiple events in the same year, instead of separate compartments containing one or two dates within the same almanac. This format has already been suggested by Madrid 30a and 31b, where a single compartment represents multiple years (Figure 5, upper left and lower right). Borgia 27 seems to have been used as a model for this type of almanac, with the picture and caption for the year in question followed by other pictures and captions representing later years in a 52-year cycle. Applying this principle to Maya almanacs, if 3 Lamat is the seasonal date for planting in one almanac, the next year the same seasonal date would fall on a different tzolkin day (4 Ben), so that planting in the next year would merit its own almanac with the same structure, and so on for however many years needed to be recorded in this way. Events taking place later in the growing season in the same years could be handled in the same way. And the presence of planting almanacs in the Madrid Codex, not all of which have intervals of 13, suggests a further departure from the Borgia canon in attempting to reconcile the structural differences between almanacs in the two codices. This must be the case with the almanac on Madrid 28d, which contains irregular intervals of what must be 20, 13, 10, and 9 years (Figure 7c). The seated maize god holding seeds in pictures 1,3, and 4 resembles the first and last pictures in Madrid 27c-28c (Figure 6b), suggesting that they serve a similar purpose. It is noteworthy that not all Madrid planting almanacs refer to complete calendar rounds. On Madrid 26d-27d, the five intervals (9, 3, 10, 2, and 2) sum to only 26</page><page sequence="20">5 1 6 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH years (Figure 8). Nevertheless, the first three pictures - of the rain god watering a maize seed, two black birds attacking the maize god, and three spotted worms or caterpillars destroying the maize god - are thematically consistent with the pictures in the other planting almanacs that have already been considered. Before proceeding with our attempt to place these almanacs in real time, it is necessary to determine, if possible, precisely what kinds of pests are represented by the animals in their pictures. For this purpose, it is instructive to refer to the descriptions (in Maya) of the experiences of traditional Maya farmers living and working in the ejido (common land, or land held in common) of Muxupip in the northwestern part of the Yucatan peninsula in the late twentieth century (Dominguez Ake 1996). They tell us that different kinds of pests attack maize plants at different times during the growing season. According to Dominguez Ake (1996:97-98; all translations by Bricker): As soon as the maize shoots emerge from the earth, they begin to be attacked. They are uprooted by grackles [k ' a 'aw] and raccoons [k 'ulu '] in order to eat the seeds from which they sprout. However, they are not the Figure 8. The pest almanac on pages 26d-27d of the Madrid Codex. (After Villacorta C. and Villacorta 1976:276, 278)</page><page sequence="21">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 5 1 7 only animals that harm the maize plants while they are growing until they are harvested. Among the other animals, there are cows [ wakax] , squirrels [ku'uk], blue jays [ch'eel], woodpeckers [ ch'uju'ut ], blackbirds 'pich' and cowbirds [ dziw ]. Among the insects that harm the maize plants there are caterpillars 'x -nook'ol' and locusts [saak']. From this description, it should be clear that grackles and raccoons are significant pests during the early part of the growing season because they dig up the maize sprouts in order to eat the seeds still attached to them. The pictures of Chac holding a digging stick while a black bird pecks at a maize seed and of a small mammal mouthing a sprouting maize seed on Madrid 28b may refer to this stage of the growing season (Figure 6a). If so, the bird could be a grackle and the mammal a raccoon (although the depiction is not a close likeness). The raccoon is also a significant pest later in the growing season, after the kernels have developed in the maize ears, when it eats them in either green or dry form: As for raccoons, they uproot young maize plants, when they first appear above the earth in order to eat the seeds from which they grow; they also eat maize ears whether they are green or dry. ... In order to be able to eat the ear of maize, this animal must first knock the maize plant to the ground. After knocking the plant over, he slashes the husk of that ear with his claws in order to expose the grains for him to eat (Dominguez Ake 1996:99-100). Even worse, from the farmer's point of view, is a raccoon's habit of going on to the next ear before consuming all the grains on the first (Dominguez Ake 1 996: 1 00). Clearly, these animals represent an ongoing problem for Maya farmers in Muxupip, and they are accordingly prominent in Dominguez Ake's description of agricultural pests.2 There were no cows in the Maya area before the arrival of the Spaniards in the sixteenth century, so they need not be considered further here. Of the other animals listed as harmful to maize, squirrels become significant pests when the ears of maize become ripe, and they, like raccoons, receive much attention in Dominguez Ake's (1996:98-99) account. They are described as the bane of the farmer's existence because of their deceptive behavior, observing the comings and goings of the farmer and sneaking into his field when he is not there. They have the same nasty habit as raccoons of moving on to the next ear before consuming all or most of the grains on the first, in the process destroying more ears of maize than necessary to satisfy their hunger. The remaining pests on the list are birds that become active when the ears of corn are ripe, and they eat the kernels whether they are green or mature. The farmer's solution is to bend the ripe ears of maize down, thereby depriving the birds of a place to perch while they are eating the kernels (Dominguez Ake 1996:100). The doubled maize ears remain in the field until the farmer is ready to harvest them.</page><page sequence="22">5 1 8 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH A prominent insect pest is the locust, a leaf-eater, leaving the stalks bare and unproductive. Their invasion of fields coincides with the time when the x-chunya ' variety of maize is coming into tassel. For this reason, farmers have traditionally planted several varieties of maize, thereby assuring themselves a harvest later in the year (Dominguez Ake 1996:103). Other Yucatecan field pests not mentioned in the quote from Muxupip include opossums ( och ), peccaries (&lt; citam ), and deer ( ceh ) (Perez Toro 1942:23). The mammal with the bare tail in the third picture of the almanac on Madrid 27c-28c (Figure 6b) cannot be a raccoon nor a squirrel, which have bushy tails, but it could be an opossum, which has a bare tail. In August and September, the hurricane season brings "night rains" (aak'ab chaako 'ob) transporting salt from the sea in aerosol form that damages the maize plants, followed by invasions of caterpillars that eat the foliage: The "torrential" night rains during the months of August and September cause the leaves of maize plants to turn red; they "redden" them, they make their roots wither, they do not produce shoots, because its water is hot, it does not come from caves, it comes from the sea, it is salty and hot water. Thus "the leaves of the maize plants become infested with caterpillars [x nook'ot]" caterpillars emerge and eat the leaves, they come from night rains. "They gnaw at the maize plant," it happens when the night rains contain hail (Dominguez Ake 1996:96). Thus, the seasonal cycle of maize involves a number of pests at different times of year. Two kinds of pests - grackles and raccoons - are active during the early part of the growing season, and they are the most likely candidates for the bird and one of the small mammals shown eating seeds and maize sprouts in the almanacs. They are joined by squirrels and other kinds of birds when the maize comes into ear and ripens, but once the ears are doubled and have begun to dry, raccoons and squirrels are the principal pests that harm the maize before it is harvested. As eaters of leafy vegetation, caterpillars and locusts invade fields well before the leaves on those plants begin to wither. Of these pests, only caterpillars are pictured and named in the Madrid Codex. The fourth picture in the almanac on Madrid 27c-28c (Figure 6b) may represent maize in tassel, a time when the larvae of fall armyworms, the caterpillar stage of the previously described moth, invade cornfields to feed on the leaves of the plants (Capinera 2001:403-4). The growing season for maize in the Maya lowlands can be theoretically divided into five periods: (1) from the end of April to the middle of June, when the seeds are planted and the first sprouts appear;3 (2) late June until late July, when the maize plants are young; (3) late July until mid-August, when there is plenty of leafy green vegetation, and the maize comes into tassel; (4) late August through September, when the hurricane season peaks; and (5) October and November, when the ears ripen and are doubled and left to dry (Redfield and Villa R. 1934:45). Grackles and raccoons are the dominant pests in the first period. Caterpillars are the principal pest in period 4. Raccoons return to the</page><page sequence="23">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 5 1 9 fields around the same time, the peak of the hurricane season, when they are accompanied by several kinds of birds, whose activities are later thwarted in period 5, when the ears are doubled. DATING PEST AND NON-PEST ALMANACS ON MADRID 24-31 Having established the probable intervals of time in the pest almanacs and the seasonal cycle of pests in Yucatan, we now turn to integrating the almanacs with "real-time" events in the seasonal cycle. The pest almanacs in the Madrid Codex have only tzolkin dates, limiting their chronological placement to positions in a 260-day cycle, unlike their counterparts in the Borgia Codex, which have both tonalpohualli and year dates that together permit them to be assigned to positions in a much longer cycle of 52 years. However, the Maya scribe who adapted the Borgia format to the constraints of the Maya almanac tradition solved this problem by including a separate yearbearer almanac in this section that could serve as a temporal anchor for some or all of the other Madrid almanacs (Hernandez and Bricker 2004:292-93). That almanac begins in the "c" register of the first page of the planting section and extends across Madrid 24c-25c (Figure 9). Its yearbearer associations have been amply documented by Seler ( 1 902-1 923 [4] :485- 86), Taube (1988:261-62), and Vail (2009:60-61). The scene of a dog with its tail on fire behind a burning brazier in the first picture echoes the scene in the lower register of the New Year's page on Madrid 36 (compare Figure 9 with Figure 10), and the tzolkin dates associated with the pictures - 5 Cauac (at Al), 5 Kan (at El), 5 Muluc (at Jl), and 5 Ix (at 01) - belong to the yearbearer series in use in northern Yucatan at the time of the conquest. These dates are separated by intervals of 13 years that are not explictly recorded in the almanac. A link between Madrid 24c-25c and other almanacs in the planting section is the seated maize god on the right side of each picture, in two cases with a closed eye signifying death (pictures 1 and 4 in Figure 9), suggesting that the placement of a yearbearer almanac among planting almanacs must have been intentional and therefore functional. Because of the similarities between the pest almanacs in this section of the Madrid Codex and the ones on Borgia 27-28, we begin our attempt to place them in historical time by exploring the possibility that the yearbearer almanac on Madrid 24c-25c refers to one of the years represented by their counterparts in the Borgia. We find that a 5 Cauac (2 Pop) New Year fell on August 14, 1468, approximately halfway through a year 2 Flint in the Aztec calendar, the one represented by the upper-right compartment on Borgia 28 (Figure 4). This chronological link between the two groups of almanacs, when combined with the seasonal information we have developed for interpreting the pest almanacs in the Madrid Codex, makes it possible to place them at the appropriate time of year in 1468-1473, overlapping the last four years on Borgia 28. The Maya New Year on 5 Cauac 2 Pop (and August 14, 1468) fell in the middle of the growing season that year, two or three months after the maize crop is normally planted. The next seeding of maize would have occurred nine or ten months later, in May or early June of 1469. This activity could be represented by the almanac on Madrid 28d, where several deities sit holding seeds, represented</page><page sequence="24">520 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 9. The yearbearer almanac on pages 24c-25c of the Madrid Codex. (After Villacorta C. and Villacorta 1976:272, 274) by the glyph for maize in the first picture and ik signs in the other pictures (Figure 7c). The ik signs at F1 and HI in the captions above the last two pictures have ci subfixes, indicating that they should be read as ic (chili pepper). This identification is supported by the apparent representation of the small bulge in the seeds of this plant by the ik glyphs in the pictures and captions. The first tzolkin date in the almanac is 12 Cimi, which can be correlated with 9 Kankin in the Maya haab and May 8, 1469, in our Gregorian calendar. No almanac in the planting section of the Madrid Codex can be assigned to the early part of the growing season in 1470, if the corresponding Maya year began on 6 Kan 2 Pop (= August 14, 1469), the yearbearer following 5 Cauac in the calendar-round cycle of 52 years. Another almanac, however, does cover this period in the following year, recording a date in May. It is the one on Madrid 26b-27b, which begins on 9 Kan and can be correlated with 17 Kankin and May 16, 1471 (Figure 11), falling in a Maya year beginning on 7 Muluc 2 Pop (= August 14, 1470). It is divided into five compartments whose intervals - in each</page><page sequence="25">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 52 1 Figure 10. Page 36 of the Madrid Codex.

God P is the deity in the first four pictures, followed by the rain god Chac in the fifth. They are shown planting seeds with digging sticks in every compartment, which is appropriate for the suggested May date of the almanac. Directional collocations appear above the first four pictures, beginning with east at A2, followed by north at D2, west at Fl-2, and south at H2. Perhaps the central direction is marked by Chac, just as the last rain god on Borgia 27 marks the center. The almanac on Madrid 26d-27d can be assigned to the same year, about two weeks after the one on Madrid 26b-27b. It begins on 1 3 Imix, which can be correlated with 14 Muan and June 2, 1471 (Figure 8). By this time, the maize has sprouted, and Chac is pouring water over a maize shoot in picture 1 . In picture 2, the maize god is being attacked by a pair of black birds and in picture 3 by three spotted caterpillars. The first two pictures are appropriate for the early June date of the almanac; the third picture is more appropriate for a later date in the growing season, overlapping with the mid-to-late rainy season almanacs in Table 3. The captions mention maize ears of different colors and green maize plants: yellow maize ear ( kan nal) at Al, black maize ear ( ek nal) at Dl, white maize ear (zac Table 3.

The term nal is a well-attested reading for the maize-foliage superfix atAl,Dl,Fl,Hl, and II (Stuart and Houston 1994:21). It has the same reading whether it is used alone or as part of a compound sign, as is the case here, where it refers to the word nal , meaning "maize ear or plant." The maize foliation is in every case attached to the head of God C, implying that the maize itself was deified. Planting in 1472 could be represented by the almanac on Madrid 27b-28b (Figure 6a), whose initial tzolkin date - 3 Ik - can be correlated with the 10 Kankin haab position and May 8, 1472, at the beginning of the rainy season. The Maya year in question began on 8 Ix 2 Pop (= August 14, 1471). The rain god Chac appears with a digging stick in all four pictures and, as noted above, a black bird in picture 2 and a small mammal in picture 3. The maize is sprouting in pictures 3 and 4, and the black bird could be a grackle and the small mammal a raccoon, the two pests that attack maize sprouts early in the growing season. The first collocation in each caption over the pictures refers to one of the cardinal directions: west ( chikin ), at Al, south at CI, east ( lakin ) at El, and north at Gl. The next collocation in each caption (at B 1 , D 1 , F 1 , and H 1 ) contains two syllabic signs - dza and pa - that together spell dzap, a verb root meaning "to plant," indicating that the planting is taking place at one of the four directions. The third collocation in each caption refers to the rain god as chac and qualifies his name with a color, black {ek) at A2 (the color prefix is now effaced), yellow (kan) at C2, red (chac) at E2, and white (zac) at G2. The last collocation in captions 2-4 is composed of two signs - "o" and "cab," together spelling ocab, which has no meaning in any known Mayan language, but the expression can be interpreted as a contraction of two morphemes - oc (enter, penetrate) and cab (earth), which is meaningful in this context, referring to Chac penetrating the earth with his digging stick. Thus, the captions describe the appropriately colored manifestation of the rain god planting (dzap) maize by inserting his digging stick in the earth (oc-cab) at each of the four cardinal directions, actions that are shown in the pictures below them, and the sequence seems to refer to planting beginning in the year 1472 and at subsequent 13-haab intervals on May 5, 1485 (3 Manik 10 Kankin), May 2, 1498 (3 Eb 10 Kankin), April 30, 1511 (3 Caban 10 Kankin), and April 26, 1524 (3 Ik 10 Kankin), completing the 52 years covered by the almanac (Figure 6a). The growing season in 1473 followed the yearbearer dated to 9 Cauac 2 Pop (= August 13, 1472). The initial date in the almanac on Madrid 30a is 11 Ahau (Figure 5, upper left), which can be correlated with 3 Pax and June 10, 1473, placing it in the early part of the rainy season in that year. The picture shows the rain god Chac and the rainbow goddess Chac Chel pouring water from pots, symbolizing rain. Several almanacs in the planting section of the Madrid Codex seem to refer to events that took place later in the growing season during the same five years. In 1469, for example, the almanac on Madrid 25d that begins on 3 Lamat (Figure 7b) can be correlated with 1 1 Cumku and July 29. The maize god appears in three of the four pictures, seated on an "earth" glyph in pictures 1 and 2 and on a</page><page sequence="29">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 525 haab glyph in picture 4. A caterpillar attacks the maize god in picture 2; the blue background implies rain, which provides an appropriate context for an infestation of fall armyworms. There is no maize god in picture 3, which instead represents a spotted animal that could be a jaguar (Vail 2009:65), although as a carnivore, its presence in a cornfield is anomalous. A more likely possibility is a water opossum ( Chironectes minimus ; Reid 1997:46). In the captions above the pictures, the rain god is named as chac at Bl, Dl, and G1 above pictures 1, 2, and 4. These names are associated with collocations for three of the four directions: east at Al, north at CI, and south at HI (the collocation for west appears at Fl). In 1470, the almanac on Madrid 27c-28c commences on 13 Muluc (Figure 6b), which corresponds to 7 Cumku and July 25. We have already described the iconography of this almanac in detail, suggesting that the presence of a fall armyworm in maize foliage in picture 4 points to the time when maize comes into tassel in late July. About three weeks later, the almanac on Madrid 30b may become relevant (Figure 5, lower left). The tzolkin date at the beginning of this almanac is 9 Chuen, which can be correlated with 4 Pop and August 16, 1470. It depicts the rainbow goddess Chac Chel with water gushing from her armpits and between her legs and a variety of mammals perched on her outstretched hands and beside her right foot. They are, from top to bottom, a water opossum, a deer, and a raccoon (with a black mask) on the left, and a peccary on the right. The deer is shown with hands and feet, instead of hoofs, a bit of artistic anthropomorphism that occurs elsewhere in the codex as well (e.g., Madrid 2a). The rain god Chac sits beside her left foot, and water flows next to the animals on her hands. All this is consistent with a mid-August date for the almanac, when the hurricane season is well underway, and deer and other animals invade the fields in search of ripening maize ears. The hurricane season reaches its peak in late August and early September, bringing heavy rains and stiff winds that can uproot maize plants. That seems to be the theme of the almanacs on Madrid 25a and 24a that can be attributed to late summer in 1471 and 1472. The almanac on Madrid 25a begins on 4 Cib (Figure 12a), which can be correlated with 4 Uo in the Maya haab and September 5, 1471. Parts of it are effaced, but enough remains of the pictures, which portray unidentified deities uprooting plants. The almanac on Madrid 24a begins on 8 Kan (Figure 12b), which can be correlated with 7 Uo and September 7, 1472. In it, the first picture shows the rain god Chac grasping a plant in one hand, probably about to rip it out of the earth, which is represented by an earth glyph. The other two pictures are similar, involving different deities (the maize god in picture 2 and Itzamna in picture 3). The only almanac whose initial tzolkin date permits it to be assigned to late summer in 1473 appears on Madrid 24d (Figure 7a). The date in question is 3 Caban, which can be correlated with 0 Uayeb and August 6 in that year. Of the pictures in the almanac, only the second - showing a worm attacking the maize god - is really relevant for the early August date. The black bird in the third picture would have been appropriate earlier or later in the growing season, and pictures 1 and 4, where Chac holds a digging stick and scatters seeds, depict</page><page sequence="30">526 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH a € fi ^ • hn'S u o o ^ ?! 2 • Jj'g I u S 3 J S p O g I cd^w^^&lt;N 6 5 s p O g cd^w^^&lt;N bO Q, C -O .55 r &gt;_ -0 .V i-tr Q, cd .55 w &lt;d 5 vo 3 J cd | S $ &lt;d 5 §£ "ss-y"</page><page sequence="31">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 527 activities characteristic of May or early June, not August. The thematic fit with late summer is therefore weak. This almanac can also be correlated with 5 Pax and June 11, 1476, providing a more appropriate seasonal tie with early summer, but that would place it three years beyond the temporal window we are using for comparison with Borgia 28. CONCLUDING REMARKS The results of the application of our cross-dating method for assigning many of the almanacs on Madrid 24-30 to the same calendar round as those on Borgia 27-28 are summarized in Table 3, which records the distribution of their initial tzolkin dates across five growing seasons, from early May through early September, for the years 1469 through 1473. It indicates that, although the Borgia and Madrid almanacs are both concerned with maize agriculture, they emphasize different parts of the growing season and different pests that attack maize, which can be explained by the different highland and lowland environments that characterize the two regions. Thus, dates in late fall are mentioned on Borgia 27-28 because of the danger of frost in Central Mexico, which is not a problem in the Maya lowlands, and dates in late summer are mentioned on Madrid 24-30, when the crops are threatened by hurricanes in the Maya lowlands, which do not pose a similar threat to maize in Central Mexico. Nevertheless, the harmful effects of strong winds and heavy rain (as well as drought) are pictured in both sets of almanacs, but in different parts of the growing season. On the other hand, both codices mention dates in the early part of the rainy season (May and June), when the maize is planted. And both codices show specific parallels in terms of calendrical structure, with Madrid 3 la being modeled on Borgia 28, whereas most of the other Madrid almanacs (especially 30a and 31b) share a 52-year cycle like that seen on Borgia 27. Both sets of almanacs depict mammalian and insect pests. The caterpillars known as fall armyworms are represented in both codices, and the seasonality of the imagery in both cases seems to refer to a period late in the season. In Mesoamerica, as in southern areas of the United States, multiple generations are reported in a single year, and they are abundant from April to December (Capinera 2001:405). They tend to thrive in wet conditions and seem to be associated with the fall season in their representation on Borgia 28 (Woolley and Milbrath 201 1). Rats are the mammals singled out for attention in the Borgia and raccoons, opossums, or squirrels in the Madrid. Locusts are significant pests in both regions; they are pictured in the Borgia but not in the Madrid. Clearly, the adaptation of Central Mexican almanacs to a Maya context required more than modifications of layout and calendrical conventions; it necessitated changes in iconographic content to make the pictures more relevant to a different natural environment. The hybridization of Central Mexican with Maya calendrical and structural conventions is not limited to the pest almanacs in the Madrid Codex. Six of the seven pages of the almanac on Madrid 1 2b- 1 8b replicate the in-extenso layout of Borgia 1-8, where all 260 days in the tonalpohualli are listed in sequence (Just 2004:258), but on the first page of the Madrid almanac, one red coefficient (1)</page><page sequence="32">528 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH and one black distance number (13) have replaced the four rows of thirteen day signs entailed by the in-extenso format. The structural inconsistencies in the Maya versions of the pest and in-extenso almanacs suggest that the information flowed from Central Mexico to the Maya area. Added support for concluding that the directional flow of ideas was from Central Mexico to the Maya area in the Postclassic period is seen on pages 48 and 49 of the Venus table in the Dresden Codex, where the Central Mexican fire god, Xiuhtecuhtli, is both pictured and named (in the partial syllabic spelling xi-wi- te-i ), and the Venus god, Tlahuiscalpantecuhtli, is named (as ta-wi-si-ca-la ), but not pictured (Seler 1898; Taube and Bade 1991; Whittaker 1986:57). The partial syllabic spellings of Nahuatl deity names in what is otherwise a Maya text attest to Central Mexico being the source of the influence. Furthermore, the artistic traditions of Central Mexico are clearly evident in Postclassic mural painting in the Maya area. The Mixteca-Puebla style clearly influenced the "International Style" murals at a number of sites in Yucatan and along the eastern coast of the Caribbean, including the Maya capital city of Mayapan, Tulum in Quintana Roo, and Santa Rita in Belize (Milbrath and Peraza 2003; Miller 1982; Robertson 1970). The fact that scribes were sharing information across linguistic boundaries suggests a broader intellectual interchange, and knowledge of pest cycles was clearly part of this exchange. The almanacs they shared may combine records of short-term weather patterns and associated pests with predictions about climate patterns over longer cycles of time. NOTES We are grateful to John Capinera for his entomological advice, to David Stahle for providing us with tree-ring data, and to Mark Brenner, Harvey Bricker, Gabrielle Vail, Chris Woolley, and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions for revising the paper. We thank Christine Hernandez for taking the time to make the superb line drawings of Borgia 27-28. 1 . From here on, we cite only the Gregorian equivalents of the Aztec and Maya dates. Astronomers and astronomy programs generally use the Julian calendar for all dates before the Gregorian reform in 1582, but we prefer to use a proleptic, back-reckoned Gregorian calendar because it serves as a better guide to the seasonal position of the dates that are important in agricultural almanacs. 2. The raccoon is also a significant agricultural pest in Central Mexico today. Among the pests reported by a contemporary Nahua community in Central Mexico, the most prominent include a dark bird resembling a crow (a grackle?), the raccoon ( mapachij in Nahuatl), the field mouse (qimichij in Nahuatl), and the "elote worm" ( eloocuilij in Nahuatl), which enters the corn from the top and consumes young corn (Sandstrom 1991 : 124, 127). Of these pests, only rats (a counterpart for field mice) are represented in Codex Borgia, the feeding patterns of the "elote worm" being more like those of the "corn earworm" ( Helicoverpa zea) than the fall armyworm, which burrows into the side of the ear. 3. The timing for planting maize varies from region to region in the Maya lowlands. In northwestern Yucatan, it is planted at the end of April, before the rains begin (called ticin muc , "dry planting"; Dominguez Ake 1996:65-66; Perez Toro 1942:17-19; Eleuterio Po'ot Yah, personal communication, 15 June 1987). It is planted equally early in the Peten region of Guatemala (Reina 1967:4-5). However, the Maya of central and eastern Yucatan</page><page sequence="33">AGRICULTURAL PESTS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES 529 wait until the first heavy rains have fallen before planting their maize crop, which can be as late as the middle of June (Bricker 1979; Redfield and Villa R. 1934:245, 295). Emergency crops may be planted later in the rainy season or even in the dry season (November) in the Peten (Reina 1967:9). We focus here on rainy-season planting because of the central role played by the rain god Chac in the Madrid almanacs. REFERENCES CITED Aveni, Anthony F. 1999. Astronomy in the Mexican Codex Borgia.
