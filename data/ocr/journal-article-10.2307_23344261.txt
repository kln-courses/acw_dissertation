<plain_text><page sequence="1">LITERARY CRITICISM The Romanticism of Rabindranath Tagore: Poetry as Sadhana Ellen Goldberg My main argument in this paper is that the religion of Rabindranath Tagore is essentially the religion of the romantic poet. His images, symbols, themes, and motifs are specific to his indigenous Indian ancestry; yet, they are also universal. While one can indeed find elements in the Hindu tradition contiguous with the romantic spirit, the two basic principles that Tagore fuses in his approach to religion, that is to say, art and faith, find their most perfect echo in the spirit of the romantic poets. Perhaps this is due in part to the influence and impact Indian thinkers and artists such as Tagore had on the colonial world. Furthermore, it is important to explain what I mean by the term 'romantic poetry.' In this paper I use the term to refer primarily to the themes prevalent in the works of the early British romantics, such as Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, and Coleridge. While there may be valuable points of similarity and comparison between Tagore and other romantic writers, such as the German poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe, it is our intention to show that Tagore's art most closely parallels the romantic ideal proclaimed by the English romantic poets. Consequently, the purpose of this examination is to focus on the religious trends in Tagore's English language works, whether trans lated from his native language Bengali or written directly in English by Tagore himself, in order to understand his specific approach to romanticism, to draw some parallels with other poets in this genre, and to appreciate and recognize the ideas the English-speaking world received as his. The intellectual and rational characteristics of the 18th century</page><page sequence="2">it seems were challenged during the romantic period. Along with this, the meaning of the term 'religion' itself underwent a significant transformation. This is evident, as Wilfred Cantwell Smith (1962) suggests, from the growing trend toward piety among common people. Smith contends that religious communities in Europe during the romantic period were seeking what he refers to as a "re-emphasis on a richer and more personal moral attitude" (1962,45). Schleiermacher was addressing precisely this type of piety-seeking religious com munity when he declared "I ask, therefore, that you turn from everything usually reckoned religion, and fix your regard on the inward emotions and dispositions" (Smithl962, 45). This sentiment captures the tone of the changing religious sentiment of the romantic period, and will be useful in our analysis of Tagore and the early British romantic poets. The changes that took place in the perception of the term 'religion' in a Christian West context during the 18th century can be viewed as a multi-layering or expansion process that is still relevant today. That is to say, the concept of religion in its social or rorporate aspect still retains an element of externalization in the form of doctrine and, at the same time, its personal or interior aspect as an inward emotion or disposition as defined above by Schleiermacher. In other words, there are essentially two dynamics at work here, namely, personal faith in a divine reality, and a system of beliefs relating to and binding a particular faith community. Smith also points out that the social or community dimension of faith is two-fold insofar as it represents both the ideal and the actual in its experience and its socio-historical context. In this sense, we understand that during this period the term 'religion' presents a bivalent designation that at best includes an individual and a corporate dimension. To the individual, religion typically refers to an inner expression of piety and personal faith, while to the group, religion represents a system of beliefs which, in turn, reflects the collective behaviour of the faith community. In this way, individual faith is mediated by one's corporate affiliations or institutional religious doctrines. With this brief view in mind, we can turn our attention to Tagore's definition of religion to see how it compares with the above sentiments. Tagore delivered his prestigious Hibbert Lectures at Manchester College in Oxford in 1930 on the subject of 'The Religion of Man.' In the Preface to the published English edition, Tagore explains that this subject is intensely personal and experiential for him, and not, as he says, merely philosophical (Tagore 1931, 7). While the growth of his religious experience is well documented in his voluminous body of writings, most of his critics, including Tagore 174 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="3">himself, agree that The Religion of Man represents the culmination of his religious thought. For this reason, I have chosen to construct an understanding of Tagore's definition of religion from this particular work. In the simplest terms, Tagore defines religion as faith. It is not faith as described above in the Christian West context, that is to say, piety, although this is clearly one dimension of Tagore's religion, but, rather, faith in the sublimity of man as revealed through art. For Tagore, faith in what he refers to as 'divine man' represents the primary ingredient of religion. Throughout his work he demonstrates an unremitting faith in the unity of life as it culminates in the self realization of the 'God in man'. This personal interpretation of Indian religiosity influenced, for instance, by the Hindu teachings of Advaita, is his raison d'etre and bespeaks the true spirit of religion for Tagore. In other words, he believes in a transcendent that is Man. .Still, Tagore claims no system of his own, nor does he claim to be a philosopher, theologian, or scholar. Instead, he identifies "himself as a poet (ami kobi). In an address given at the Sri Ramakrishna Centenary Parliament of Religions in 1936, Tagore announced: "I have nothing new to tell you, no esoteric truth to propound to you. I am a mere poet, a lover of men and of creation" (Tagore quoted in Isherwood 1945, 75). Consequently, it is the religion of poetry that we will attempt to understand in our analysis of Tagore and the early British romantics. As a poet, Tagore does not see himself obligated by the second aspect of religion mentioned earlier, that is to say, the institutional doctrines or creeds that bind the social dimension of religious communities. Instead, as he relays, his inspiration derives directly from nature, a symbol which for Tagore not only exceeds himself, but with which he feels both ultimately and universally one. Ac cordingly, the source of all creativity, and the inspiration of his poetic abilities, emanate from the self or the God in man as revealed through nature. Hence, we see that at the heart of his compositions lies the eternal quest of a pilgrim poet in search of union with God through the creative process. In Tagore's view, the various systems of religious belief through out history represent evidence of man's search for the humanity of God and testify to an evolving and collective faith in the perfectibility of the human being. Consequently, the truth of each religion may be judged not by its material or earthly power, says Tagore, but, rather, by its "standard of human perfection" (Tagore 1931, 61). Tagore's own concept of religion, then, recognizes in principle the corporate aspect of religion as an ideal or standard that guides the Ellen Goldberg / 175</page><page sequence="4">individual in his/her spiritual progress. However, in his own personal search Tagore neither conforms nor consistently adheres to any one system of belief. Instead he reflects and documents his own individual understanding of religious experience predicated on his inner faith in 'Man the Eternal' through his production of art. Moreover, Tagore refers to society as a "collective creation" through which the individual strives to attain the ideals of truth, goodness, and beauty (Tagore 1922, 22). Its function is primarily to enable the individual to attain the divine in humanity. Insofar as any system leads humanity to that goal, it is considered constructive. Similarly, Tagore does not hesitate to reproach those systems that promote earthly power and material success, and/or fail to inspire the divinity or perfectability of humanity. He writes: Such is the tragedy that so often besets our history when this love of power, which is really the love of self, domineers over the religious life of man, for then the only means by which man could hope to set his spirit free, itself becomes the worst e lemy of that freedom. Of all fetters those that falsely assume spiritual designations are the most difficult to break, and of all dungeons the most terrible are those invisible ones where men's souls are imprisoned in self-delusion bred by vanity. The self-magnification, with its con sequent thwarting of the best in man, that goes on unashamed when religion deadens into sectarianism is a perverse form of worldliness under the mask of religion. (Tagore quoted in Isherwood 1945, 78) His admonishment of escalating sectarianism and normative trends in colonial religion derives from the recognition that it potentially obstructs and stifles the progress of humanity and, hence, the perfectability of the God in 'man'. In the collective writings of Tagore we also see that he con tinually searches for a mysterious region that lies beyond the world of experience. It is in this realm that Tagore believes humanity finds their ultimate fulfillment. For all intents and purposes, it is an evolution toward union with God, as he explains: We are groping in the dark, not yet clear in our idea of the ultimate meaning at the centre of this world. Nevertheless, through the dim light which reaches us across the barriers of our physical existence, we seem to have a stronger faith in this spiritual life than in 176 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="5">the physical. For even those who do not believe in the truth which we cannot define, but call by the name of spirit — even they are obliged to behave as though they did believe it to be true, or, at any rate, truer than the world which is evident to our senses....This fact expresses man's deeper urge for freedom, for liberation of itself in the realm of the limitless where he realizes his relationship with the truth which relates him to the universe in a disinterested spirit of love. (Tagore quoted in Isherwood 1945, 77). Hence, in his view, our present civilization represents centuries of striving toward perfection, but still we have not realized that ultimate 'end of man' (purusartha) completely. Nevertheless, the religion of man is demonstrated, according to Tagore, by continued faith in the humanity of God. With this understanding of Tagore's concept of religion, we can now turn our attention to the principal characteristics that distinguish and mark the romantic period as it applies to our understanding of both religion and early English romantic poetry. H. N. Fairchild (1949) maintains that "romanticism means in art what pantheism means in theology" (1949,3). In this sense, "romanticism, at its deepest and most intense, is essentially a religious experience" (1949, 3). Jacques Barzun (1961) asserts that one possible movement of Roman ticism was toward "union with God, conceived Either traditionally, or pantheistically or metaphysically" (1961, 94). Accordingly, at the root of the romantic movement, and the romantic poet's temperament, resides a profound religious belief in man as God. By the power of the poetic imagination, the romantic poet endeavours to resolve the seeming disharmony and duality inherent in the human condition, and unify the finite and infinite aspects of humanity through tran scendence and integration in their art. Indeed, the integration of the finite and infinite aspects of 'being' is the revelation of the creative genius of the romantic poet. Art, being an extension of one's own inner creative and therefore divine essence, seeks a reconciliation between disharmony, on the one hand, and an expanded awareness of the unity of creation, on the other. Indeed, it is in the artistic process itself or disclosure of this experience of the ultimate mystery of the universe that the romantic poets' service and contribution to humanity lies. Fairchild (1949) recognizes, for instance, that the interfusion of the finite and the infinite is "precious" to the romantic poet. He writes: "by effacing all distinction and boundaries it permits unlimited outward projection of personal energy" (1949, 4). What Fairchild refers to as Ellen Goldberg ¡177</page><page sequence="6">"personal energy" agrees in essence with the term "man's surplus" used repeatedly by Tagore. To employ Tagore's term of reference, the romantic poet affirms his faith in the belief that through the surplus in man one actually becomes divine. Indeed, as we will see, the ability to expand or perfect humanity is basic to the spirit of romantic religiosity. Furthermore, the social dimension of the romantic spirit is equally idealistic, but nonetheless consistent with a romantic world view based on a belief in harmony and unity. Through the romantic lens, the poet actively attempts to envision a new world order in the here and now — one in which goodness, beauty and truth prevail. Only in such a world can the creative surplus of man most fully express itself. The circumstances fuelling the rise of the English romantic poets in Britain (1780-1830) included Orientalist influences, the Industrial Revolution, a post-Revolutionary conservatism, a Utilitarian-Evan gelicalism and, according to Fairchild, a "pervasive pre-Victorian spirit of smug indifference to art" (1949, 6). In other words, the English romantic poets, like Tagore in colonial India, found themselves H a situation "of having to fashion a new set of institutions and conventions after the decay and destruction of the old" (Barzun 1961, 18). In setting out to create a new society, they attempted to fashion an organic, humanistic society that revealed the romantic ideals of truth (unity), goodness, and beauty. Moreover, in response to their particular historical contexts and antecedents, they subsequently supernaturalized nature and endowed 'her' with divine attributes. The English romantic poets, like Tagore, affirmed the pantheistic belief that there is no disharmony between the spirit of God and the spirit of man. In fact, it is the supreme responsibility of the romantic poet to disclose this truth through poetry. For instance, in "The Prelude"William Wordsworth writes: When I began in youth's delightful prime To yield myself to Nature, when that strong And holy passion overcame me first, Nor day nor night, evening, or morn, was free From its oppression. But, O Power Supreme! Without Whose call this world would cease to breathe, Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill The veins that branch through every frame of life, making man what he is, creative divine (Wordsworth 1904, 199). In this passage we see how Wordsworth shapes an anthropomorphic deity who reflects, as Tagore says, the God in man. In fact, the romantic 178 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="7">poet typically fashions himself as supreme creator. And, William Blake tells us in "Jerusalem": "We live as One Man—"an idea inspired by his mentor Emmanuel Swedenbourg who claims: "Man can have no idea greater than Man....To think of holiness distinct from man is impossible to the affections." In other words, nothing greater than the divine in man exists. This is precisely the religious sentiment revealed throughout the collective works of Tagore. Another significant characteristic of romantic poetry is the religious quest for boundless self-expansion. By this I am referring to the personal challenge of bringing the individual creative imagi nation and the universal mind together. For instance, in "The Recluse" Wordsworth describes the unity inherent in the interchange between the "Intellect of Man" and the "Godly Universe". To quote: How exquisitely the Individual Mind (And the progressive powers perhaps no less Of the whole species) to the external World Is fitted: - and how exquisitely , too - ...this but little heard of among men And the creation (by no lower name Can it be called) which they with blended might Accomplish: this is our high argument. (Wordsworth 1904, 322) In other words, all things are one. For Wordsworth, and all of the romantic poets including Tagore, nature motivates and elevates the interior life of the mind to noble and sacred deeds, most notably the creation of poetry. In this creative endeavour, the romantic poet symbolically embraces the unity of the external world to which his "individual mind" is most perfectly "fitted." Absorption of the many into the one is the proposed goal, as American romantic Ralph Waldo Emerson acknowledges: Within man is the soul of the whole There is no bar or wall in the soul Where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. (Emerson quoted in Fairchild 1949, 167) Thus, the line between the universal and the particular is vague and tends to melt one into the other as individual consciousness grows increasingly aware of its own divinity through integration. A similar view is put forth by Percy Bysshe Shelley demon Ellen Goldberg / 179</page><page sequence="8">strating that the underlying spirit of nature pervades all phenomena. He writes: Throughout this varied and eternal world Soul is the only element, the block that for uncounted ages has remained. The moveless pillar of a mountain's weight Is active, living spirit. (Shelley quoted in Fairchild 1949, 356) The idea being conveyed in this passage is that the soul of the universe dwells in man. Indeed, in all of the examples cited, there is a distinct admission of faith in the inherent unity and singularity between the internal and external, the human and divine, and the finite and infinite, and it is through the artistic process that the romantic-poet feels or communes with his own divinity. In other words, through art the poet tries to capture the experiential awareness of the one and the many. This experience is made possible through love, for it is the power through which the poet enters God. Love is the instrument, and in essence, the religion of the romantic poet. In fact, typically the romantic poet abhors hatred and violence, disharmony, and advocates a love most sublime as the path to union with God. In response to the question "what is love?" Shelley replies: It is that powerful attraction towards all that we conceive, or fear, or hope beyond ourselves, when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an in sufficient void, and seek to awaken in all things that are, a community with what we experience within ourselves. If we reason, we would be understood; if we imagine, we would that the airy children of our brain were born anew within another's; if we feel, we would that another's nerves should vibrate to our own, that the beams of their eyes should kindle at once and mix and melt into our own, that lips of motionless ice should not reply to lops quivering and burning with the heart's best blood. This is love. This is the bond and the sanction which connects not only man with man, but with everything that exists. We are born into the world, and there is something within us which, from the instant that we live, more and more thirsts after its own likeness. (Shelley quoted in Perkins 1967, 1070-1) 180 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="9">Thus, love is the path or inner calling to discover ourselves in others and in nature so as to awaken our own likeness, that is to say, our humanity or the divine in man. Through the creative act, the romantic poet imitates God most closely and, in so doing, recognizes himself as divine. However, the romantic poet also values the particular, that is to say the multiplicity of the phenomenal world and it, in turn, becomes a profound symbol of God. Individual creation is exalted as the revelation of the divine. As such, all forms have intrinsic worth and are sacred precisely because they reveal the sacred. Through diversity (e.g., the subject matter, themes, landscapes, locale, etc.) the romantic poet explores the manifestation of form, and makes Blake's famous line "To see the world in a blade of grass" real. In other words, the romantic poet unveils the inner mystery behind the veil of multiplicity. Overall, the aesthetic implications and goals of the early ro mantic poets as expressed through their art interfuse with and evoke distinct religious concerns. Art, itself, is an aesthetic representation of the creative essence in humanity which, in turn, imitates the creative principle of the divine. The goal of the romantic poet is to most perfectly emulate the creativity of God. To do this, the poet's art assumes a plage in one's life equal to the role usually reserved for religion. The ideal end of the artistic process is perfect form, boundless self-expansion," the enrichment of humanity, and the integration of the particular and the universal, because they most fully represent the divine. In other words, the metaphysical ends of the romantic poet's quest is the perfectability of man through the realization of his oneness with God. While these goals, no doubt, touch upon only the broadest aspects of the romantic spirit, they disclose, I think, the fundamental trends found in early romantic poetry. As such, they also most closely echo and cohere with the values and concerns of Tagore. Clearly, romanticism as a historical movement is a vast subject well beyond the scope of this paper. What is significant to this study, however, is not the movement per se, but, rather, the nature of the religious inquiry undertaken by many of its leading spokespersons as it relates to the major themes in the writings of Tagore. Like all romantic poets, Tagore also believes that art is the primary creative medium through which the individual is most able to express their faith in the religion of "Universal Man." In other words, by creating poetry Tagore declares his love for God. For instance, in "Unending Love" he writes: Ellen Goldberg / 181</page><page sequence="10">I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times, In life after life, in age after age forever. My spell-bound heart has made and re-made the necklace of songs That you take as a gift, wear around your neck in your many forms In life after life, in age after age forever. Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain Its ancient tale of being apart or together, As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time; You become an image of what is remembered forever. You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount At the heart of time love of one for another. We have played alongside millions of lovers, shared in the same Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell— Old love, but in shapes that renew and renew forever. Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you , The love of all man's days, both past and forever: Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life, The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours— And the songs of every poet past and forever. (Tagore 1986, 49) As this poem so beautifully demonstrates, art becomes a spiritual exercise or sadhana for Tagore, and his collective writings document his spiritual journey toward an ideal of union. He believes, as he writes: "Unity comes to us from the One, and the One in ourselves opens the door and receives it with joy" (Tagore 1922,13-14). Clearly, Tagore witnesses within himself a reciprocity between the universal and the particular and, like the British romantics, agrees that it is the responsibility of the poet to reveal this profound ineffable re lationship. All forms of perfection, that is to say beauty, are understood and experienced as manifestations of the underlying unity of life. 182 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="11">Within this dynamic vitality of opposites lies an all-pervading harmony which, according to Tagore, can be called Beauty, Truth, or Unity. Similarly, John Keats equates beauty with truth in his oft-quoted "Ode on a Grecian Urn." He writes: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is All Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know" (Keats quoted in Perkins 1967,1186). In other words, the urn and the ode referred to in the poem are products of human artistry, they are creative acts and, as such, represent a conscious attempt on the part of the poet to disclose his own inner struggle for truth and perfection. In such a lofty and noble pursuit, the poet manifests the romantic ideals (beauty, truth and goodness) which are the salient characteristics of the romantic period. Tagore, like Keats, writes that "truth reveals itself in beauty." As he states, creation is the perpetual har mony between the infinite ideal of perfection and the eternal continuity of its realization; that so long as there is no absolute separation between the positive ideal and the material obstacle to it's attainment, we need not be afraid of suffering and loss. (Tagore 1922, 15-16). This, Tagore says, is "the poet's religion" (1922, 15-16). Separation, however, is also an integral part of the human predicament, and herein lies the root of human suffering. Until man attains union with the divine, pain is a consequence of the pilgrim's journey toward self-realization. Shelley captures this pain of sepa ration in his poem "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty" when he writes: The awful shadow of some unseen Power Floats through unseen among us — visiting This various world with as inconstant wing As summer winds that creep from flower to flower, Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower, It visits with inconstant glance Each human heart and countenance; Like hues and harmonies of evening, Like clouds in starlight widely spread, Like memory of music fled, Like aught that for its grace may be Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery. Spirit of beauty, that dost consecrate With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon Of human thought or form — where art thou gone? Ellen Goldberg / 183</page><page sequence="12">Why dost thou pass away and leave our state, This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate? Ask why this sunlight not for ever Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river, Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown, Why fear and dream and death and birth Cast on the daylight of this earth Such gloom, why man has such a scope For love and hate, despondency and hope? (Shelley quoted in Perkins 1967, 970) * In this piece, written six years before his death, Shelley intuits the ineffable mystery of an eternal reality exceeding this world of illusion. The power of separation is felt in each question he poses, and yet the speaker vows to dedicate his energy (i.e., the surplus in man), or his art, to pursue the "unseen power." Tagore was transformed by a similar experience of direct communion with the "unseen powdr" that Shelley addresses in his poem. In The Religion of Man, Tagore recalls When 1 was eighteen a sudden spring breeze of religious experience for the first time came to my life and passed away leaving in my memory a direct message of spiritual reality....The invisible screen of the common place was removed from all things and all men, and their ultimate significance was intensified in my mind; and this is the definition of beauty. That which was memorable in this experience was its human message, the sudden expansion of my consciousness in the superpersonal world of man. (1931, 91-92) This vision lasted for four days, after which Tagore felt the lid on his inner perception lower. "The Awakening of the Waterfall" ("Nirjharer Svapnabhanga "), published in the collection titled Morning Songs (Prabhat Sangeet), celebrates this transformative experience. An English trans lation of Tagore's poem follows: This morning the rays of the sun Struck at the root of my being. I do not know how it happened. But my life has awakened from its sleep. The waters surge and swell, Life's passion I cannot hold back. Oh how the earth shakes and trembles! 184 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="13">Thg, pebbles hurtle and fall. Surging and swaping, the foaming waves Roar and tumble in relentless rage. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 35) In this pivotal poem, Tagore's dormant spirit like the inner force of the waterfall is awakened by the sunlight and, as a result, his joy pours forth in recognition of being one with nature. The overall tone of Morning Songs captures the poet's newly-found sense of univer sality, and its lyrics abound in images of light*mirroring the intensity of Tagore's communion with nature and its corresponding beauty. Furthermore, through this experience Tagore is awakened, like Shelley, to a love for all humanity. In fact, Tagore has included works by Shelley and Victor Hugo in this collection demonstrating his pre disposition toward the spirit of romanticism. As Tagore grew older he was graced by a second transformative experience. He writes: I suddenly became conscious of a stirring of soul within me. My world of experience in a moment seemed to be lighted, and facts that were detached and dim found a great unity of meaning.... The unmeaning fragments lost, their individual isolation and my mind revelled in the unity of a vision... the facts of my life suddenly appeared to me in a luminous unity of truth.... I had felt that I had found my religion at last, the religion of Man, in which the infinite became defined in humanity and came close to me so as to need my love and cooperation. (1931, 13-14) During this extraordinary experience Tagore met what he calls the "lord of his life" (jivan devata), and his religion or faith in the divine in man was revealed to him. He glimpsed the unity of creation and kept that vision in his heart throughout his life. This integrating recognition profoundly affected his worldview and inspired his personal religious philosophy of universal humanism. Yet, for Tagore, and also for Shelley, it is this very vision of the mysterious unseen power that lies beyond and separate from the material world which causes them so much pain, for they have tasted the presence of the divine in a rare state of illumination and now, more than ever, feel their own separation. In the "Flight from the Alone to the Alone" Tagore reaches an interim stage referred to in Christian mysticism as 'the dark night of the soul'. This ex Ellen Goldberg / 185</page><page sequence="14">perience, so well illustrated in the writings of Spanish mystic Saint John of the Cross (1542-91), precedes the final stage of union con sidered to be the very goal of the Christian mystic quest. Indeed, Sisirkumar Ghose (1961) observes that during the latter phase of Tagore's life he seems "to have more affinities with the Christian idea of the Dark Night of the Spirit than with the clear spaces of Upanisadic mysticism"(1961, 87). In this experience, Tagore feels the loneliness of the pilgrim's journey, and acknowledges the call to the "alone." He writes: ...suddenly from pralaya's tapering tower the Great One sends out his call to the alone. I opened my eyes in the midst of countless stars unknown.... The Lord of the Universe is alone, and I have my invitation in the act of creation, in the immense Within, at the foot of His seat. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1961, 87) The Bengali Vaisnava poets, like the romantics, again and again speak of the pain of separation (viraha) in their poetry and songs. Their devotional lyrics, much admired and respected by Tagore, celebrate the love of the gopi Radha and the god Krishna manifest as a divine cowherd youth. The theme of viraha, a pervasive metaphor used in Vaisnava theology, symbolizes the intense longing of the soul for union with the divine. As a young boy, Tagore came across a collection of Vaisnava lyric poems that focused on this theme. He remembers: 1 became aware of some underlying idea deep in the obvious meaning of these love poems. I felt, the joy of an explorer who suddenly discovers the key to the language lying hidden in the hieroglyphs which are beautiful in themselves. I was sure that these poets were speaking about the Supreme Lover, whose touch we experience in all our relations of Love.... (Tagore quoted in Lago 1976, 104) Mary Lago (1976) observes that Tagore embraces distinct theological motifs and poetic conventions from the Vaisnava poets. Among them, the theme of viraha is most prominent due, in part, to the fact that this sentiment was congruous with his own religious experiences. He does not advocate, however, the emotionality or iconicity of the bhakti (devotional) poets, but expresses in his unique way his own 186 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="15">personal feelings of longing and separation. Through this poetic and theological metaphor Tagore attributes the quality of universality to the feelings of separation. To quote: It is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and gives birth to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky. It is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all night from star to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness of July. It is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires, into sufferings and joys in human homes; and this it is that ever melts and flows in songs through my poet's heart. (Tagore 1917, 98). Again, in another poem he writes: Art thou abroad on this storm night on thy journey of love, my friend? The sky groans like one in despair. I have no sleep tonight. Ever and again I open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend! I can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy path! By what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what edge of the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me, my friend! (1917, 40). In these two poems," the traveller's pain is echoed in nature, with whom the poet is one. Pathos, arising from the painful realization of one's separateness, is a fundamental component of Tagore's art and religion. As the attainment of unity becomes inescapably beyond Tagore's grasp, the theme becomes more pervasive. This is particularly true in his later work when the experience of perfect unity seems forever out of his reach. In Patraput, number 12, he confesses: It is to find himself that man sets out on the journey of life. The singer I have known in my heart's truth, But the man who gives his life, him I have not known. He who wins life from the coils of death, without ever knowing that heroic man, I am going away, weak and pale, Ellen Goldberg / 187</page><page sequence="16">with the humiliation of the vague and the unfulfilled. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 70) Here, Tagore contemplates his own failure to attain the perfect union that lies at the core of the poet's religion. Again, his sense of isolation is compellingly conveyed in Sesh Lekha when he writes: The first day's sun had asked at the manifestation of new being— Who are you. No answer came. Year after year when by, the last sun of the day the last question utters on the western sea-shore, in the silent evening— Who are you. He gets no answer. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 182) Commenting on this poem, Ghose observes that Tagore makes a "rare death declaration" that communicates "the penumbra of the ungrasped mystery" (1986,184). That is to say, Tagore acknowledges "his defeat before the altar of the Great Unknown" (1986, 184). The unyielding silence that greets Tagore year after year echoes Shelley's own experience of defeat when he acknowledges: No voice from some sublime world hath ever To sage or poet these responses given. (Shelley quoted in Perkins 1967, 971) The realization of the endlessness of the journey toward infinite perfection, and the imminent possibility of failure, is cause for the romantic poet's despair. The acknowledgment that Tagore could remain on the borders of the ultimate (expressed by both Shelley and Tagore as silence) until the end of his life "gnaws at the very core of his being" (Ghose 1986, 35). However, Tagore is also a poet of profound hope, and his unshakable faith in the divinity of man sustains him through these periods of the dark night of the soul. As a poet of hope, Tagore's art stands as an example of his faith in 'Man the Eternal.' He recognizes the potential fulfillment of 188 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="17">the perfectability o£ man, j.ust as he admits the difficulty in attaining such lofty aspirations. Throughout his poetic journey, he does not lose faith in man's quest for fullness, for it is in that very vision that the goal of life dwells, and faith in that represents the poet's religion. Consequently, while Tagore declares, on the one hand, — "my poems have failed to reach the All," he declares, on the other hand, "I shall not commit the grievous sin of losing faith in Man" (Ghose 1986, 34). He can say this with confidence because, as he writes, I have seen, have heard, have lived in the depth of the known have felt the truth that exceeds all knowledge Which fills my heart with wonder and I sing. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 34) In this sense, Tagore knows experientially that the Infinite resides in the heart of man. Again, in Gitanjali he proclaims: The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world in rhythmic measures. It is the same life that shouts joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tunjultuous waves of leaves and flowers. It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and death, in ebb and in flow. I feel that my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world. And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment. (1917, n. p.) Once again, we see here that it is through nature, or the physical manifestation of the universal spirit, that Tagore communicates his spiritual experiences. Analogous to the romantic poets, Tagore's lyrics capture his adoration for the infinite in all things and he worships god unceasingly through the poetic process. Indeed, his religious process is indistinguishable from his artistic process. As we stated earlier, as god creates so does the romantic poet referred to by Tagore as the divine in man. Thus, the poet's art, that is to say, his creation, is a testimonial to the unity of life. The soul of the universe, as it were, resides in the heart of man. Blake declares: To see the World in a Grain of Sand/And Heaven in Wild Flower. Ellen Goldberg / 189</page><page sequence="18">Tagore defines his work as the "response of the creative soul to the call of the Real" (Tagore 1931, 137). Artistry emerges from man's surplus. Put another way, it is the infinite in man that seeks itself through creative expression. This self-expression belongs to the surplus which is not consumed by mere survivalist needs, but is the luxury of the poet. Creativity thrives in the surplus of man and surges forth pushing the artist to realize the goal of life. In this sense, Tagore believes that through art man enters more fully into a relationship with the divine, revealing, in turn, the mystery of his own inner unity with the essence of all things. While discussing Blake's poem "Never Seek To Tell Thy Love," Tagore in fact writes: Literature as an art offers us the mystery which is in its unity....It has its grammar, its vocabulary. When we divide them part by part and try to torture out a confession from them, the poem which is one departs like the gentle wind, silently, invisibly. No one knows how it exceeds all its parts, transcends all its laws, and communicates with the person. This significance which is in unity is an eternal wonder. (Tagore quoted in Chakravarty 1966, 239) Each composition itself represents a creative unity wherein the sum of the whole exceeds the sum of its parts. Moreover, through the medium of poetry, man corroborates in revealing the mystery of their essential oneness. In the poem "Fireflies" Tagore writes: I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall. (Tagore quoted in Chakravarty 1966, 339) And, in a later poem, Tagore says: I have written my play, in it is the silence of the eternal and the dynamics of the living times. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 71) In this sense, the religious quest of Tagore is essentially the religious quest of the romantic poet. As artists they are consumed by their profound Utopian quest for the divine in man and, as a 190 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="19">result, endowed their art with a grandeur and reverence usually reserved for religion. The romantics communicated their personal journeys through diverse themes that embraced such ideas as tran scendentalism, nostalgia, myth, and so on. These themes, among others, are also prevalent in the works of Tagore. However, it is important to bear in mind that when Tagore evokes these thematic devices, such as historical relativism or mythology, he looks to the history and context of India rather that the traditions of the West. When he looks back nostalgically to the classical age, he looks to the Hindu classical age rather than the Greek or Roman periods, as the early British romantic poets did. Thus, in their own specific contexts, each found a wisdom appropriate to the romantic temperament for reinterpretation and celebration. Tagore was, no doubt, inspired by the spirit and literary expertise of romantic poetry, but, he clearly looked to his own tradition and experience to provide the particular images, themes, and symbols for his poetry. The rich influences he drew from include the great Sanskritic literary tradition of (e.g., Kalidasa), the Bauls and other noted Vaisnava bhakti poets, the non-dualist (advaita) religious teachings of the Upanisads, rural life in Bengal, an international network of friends and admirers, a privileged family life, and even the wisdom of Sakyamuni Buddha. Above all, the legacy of the Bengali Renaissance to which he was heir shaped the romantic spirit of the poet's religion. These particular indigenous influences, however, are fused with the universal themes we see in the British romantic movement, specifically the pursuit of direct communion with the divine, faith in the divinity of humanity, and the exaltation of the human imagi nation or creative genius as a universal faculty of the personality. These fundamental aspects of Tagore's religiosity are entirely con sistent with the romantic movement's poetic religious quest. While scholars generally accept that Tagore succeeded in doing what no other Indian writer had done before in terms of synthesizing his socio-religious beliefs and experiences in his writings, his expe riences are nonetheless deeply informed by the unity of all life and the inspiration that, like breath, moves us all. Indeed for Tagore, "life is a continual process of synthesis— not of additions" (Tagore 1920, 20). He possessed an acute ability to harmonize the dualities of life e.g., East-West, tradition-modernity, continuity-change, and so on, in his work. His art becomes a rare expression of an aestheticism that resembles, in spirit, the epiphany of the hero in his most accomplished novel, Gor a, written in 1907 immediately following his retirement from Indian political life. He exclaims: Ellen Goldberg / 191</page><page sequence="20">Today I am free...today I am really an Indian. In me there is no longer any opposition between Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. Today every caste in India is my caste, the food of all is my food. (Tagore 1924, 185) This can be considered a declaration of what Tagore considers "Indian" to be. That is to say, the realization of unity within and without, and the expressed awareness that "the one in me knows the universe of the many" (Tagore 1922, 20). In ideal terms, being "Indian" in Tagore's times implied recognizing a humanity that is boundless, limitless, beyond borders, and eternal. Until this moment of recog nition occurs, and we can say we know our humanity, Tagore claims we are driven by fragmentary aspirations and communal self interest which perpetuates disharmony and divisiveness. Consequently, in Tagore's view it is through love that man can transcend the world of relativity and thereby achieve the highest aim of life called moksa. This is certainly reminiscent of the romantic perspective. Gora, like Shelley, points the way to unity through love, and he defines love in this way: ...whatever name our logic may give to the truth of human unity, the fact can never be ignored that we have our greatest delight when we realize ourselves in others, and this is the definition of love. This love gives us the testimony of the great whole, which is the complete and final truth of Man.... The Spirit of Love, dwelling in the boundless realm of the surplus, emancipates our consciousness from the illusory bond of separateness of self; it is ever trying to spread its illumination to the human world. (Tagore 1931, 47) In this declaration, Tagore expresses his faith in divine man recognized through love, and the inspiration to evolve toward perfection rep resents the fullness of the evolutionary process. It is in essence man's duty (dharma) to exceed the limits of his finiteness and extend himself "beyond all borders." Only in this humanity is man truly universal. To this end, Tagore rejects the ascetic ideal as the static dogma ^)f institutional religion, and proclaims instead, the poet's religion. That is to say, a personal faith in the divinity of man realized through creativity and love. This is confirmed when he writes "I do not put my faith in any institutions but in the individuals all over the world who think clearly, feel nobly, and act rightly, thus becoming channels 192 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="21">of moral truth" (Tagore quoted in Hay 1970,453). In this most intimate expression of faith Tagore's religious quest most closely resembles that of the romantic poet. Using Indian symbols and concepts to describe the pilgrimage, Tagore consistently poeticizes the path upon which all must ultimately travel. For instance, in the "Forerunner" he writes: O Traveller! You are alone— How could you see the unknown within you? (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 40) Like the early romantic poets, Tagore understands and communicates the pervading spirit of the universe. He has been illuminated by its divine light, yet this brings with it the mixed emotions of hope, joy, and pain. He has attained an inner knowledge of his link with all humanity, but has not attained freedom (mukti, moksha). In other words, he remains a captive of the "borderland" as he says because he has failed to transcend the world of relativity in this lifetime. Yet, like a true romantic poet, he continues to honor the process of truth and transcendence in his art. In 1937 Tagore suffered a serious illness, and death and rebirth through suffering (duhkha) became imminent. It was at this time that he wrote Prantik, a collection of eighteen poems that address the theme of the borderland. As Ghose observes, this work is marked by "spots of illumination set against a background of gloom" (1986, 81). The poems reveal a psychological journey as if he is living on the borderland or margins. But, in Senjuti, the atmosphere of "gloomi ness" is exchanged by hope in the potentiality of man. Tagore confides: In the chink between the light and the dark Can be glimpsed the fading outlines of the unknown shore. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 101) During a recent lecture on M. K. Gandhi, his grandson R. C. Gandhi told the audience that one sign of man's greatness is his striving to attain truth or God. That is to say, to attain something that is exceedingly beyond one's self. According to Gandhi, it is not the actual attainment that demonstrates our greatness, but, rather, the very act of trying. Tagore's poem dedicated to Buddhist monks captures this spirit. He writes: Ellen Goldberg / 193</page><page sequence="22">Their lives, ort the unattained path, have not been in vain. They have become one with that great and bodiless Being. Who, unseen, gives strength to Eternal Man. Today, in this morning light, I receive the touch of their compassion, And bow to them. (Tagore 1977, 135) By this definition, Tagore could also be considered a great man. His whole life was dedicated to the pursuit of truth, to discover the "call of the Real." In his final hours he struggled with his inability to transcend the borders of this world. The world that brought him great joy also brought him great pain—but he loved it nonetheless. He did not deny the "razor's edge," but he was admittedly not able to complete the pilgrim's journey because he was attached to the "immortal gifts of the Earth" (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 101 2). For instance, in Prantik, Number 7 we hear him cry out: 0 samsara, call me back once again; before going west, do not reject me like some neglected beggar Fill this cup of life to overflowing. (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 102) Like the true romantic poet, Tagore is both delighted and intoxicated by the resplendent beauty of nature, by his humanity, and by life itself. With one voice he sings "Blessed is this life of mine" and with another he yearns for union with the divine: 1 see sudden flashes The realm beyond Darkness, Where immersed I lay In consciousness of the Great Being— I have beheld in sudden flashes, The Infinite, behind the veil of the finite. Oh Sun! Remove the veil that covers your light! In your perfect light May I see my true self. The self that at journey's end, Mingles its breath with the air. (Tagore 1977, 135) 194 / Indian Literature : 204</page><page sequence="23">In order to reach the "journey's end" where the borders of this world and the other become one, the sense of an individual self must be merged with God. Only then, in the knowledge of the indivisibility of all creation, is the "journey's end" realized. Perhaps he loved the journey—marked by many gifts including fame, privilege, accom plishment, service to humanity—too much to relinquish that final footing in the borderland. Tagore describes himself throughout his writings as a solitary pilgrim on an endless journey. By his own admission Tagore did not belong to any one nation, but, rather, to all nations. Nor did he belong to any one religious movement, but, rather, his religion was the synthesis of many. And, as I have tried to show, his deep religious quest for the divine in man though consistent with the renaissance of Indian religiosity, bespeaks a romantic poetic tempera ment. He stood on the border looking at Indian society, looking at the international community, and looking at himself. He fulfilled his duty (dharma) to each of these as a romantic poet. His legacy speaks to all, but especially to those romantics who have dared to journey on 'the razor's edge" in order to touch the humanity that lies in each of us. In conclusion, like the romantic poets Tagore believes firmly, that art is the supreme way to reveal the mystery of the unity of life. Through the "poetic genius" the romantic poet authentically embraces and communicates his vision, which in Tagore's case, is the "Religion of Man." According to Tagore, it represents "an ideal hovering over and permeating the earth, an ideal of that Paradise which is not the mere outcome of fancy, but the ultimate Reality in which all things dwell and move" (Tagore 1931, 49). In fact, this vision became a reality in the sense that Tagore was called to cooperate in the transmission of this message of the divinity of man through his art. As he asserts, "all else, theology, legislation, seem secondary" (Tagore quoted in Ghose 1986, 85). Romanticism is an attitude, a temperament, and a spirit that defies precise definition due, in part, to the broad scope and inherent contradictions that the term embraces. Nonetheless, what is certain is that the romantic character is personified by a quest to communicate for the divine in man and nature through the poetic imagination. These qualities are fundamental to Tagore's own religious thought. He speaks in terms of the religion of the poet, and celebrates the poetic genius as a religious path. It is a singularly focused message with universal implications. In a way, it resembles the mystic quest, though it does not presuppose the same detachment, renunciation, or process of purification required by the mystical life. Ellen Goldberg / 19o</page><page sequence="24">For all of the sudden flashes and visions the romantic poets describe in their writings, they have not themselves, as a brotherhood of wanderers, arrived at freedom's door. Rather, they stand on the borderline and pronounce the presence of the chasm that lies between them and liberation. Tagore, like the early British romantics, remained a 'poet of the earth'. He left no system, nor is there potential in his work to systematize his thought, because Tagore was, by his own admission, only a poet. Even though Tagore's longings speak to an internationally constituted community, his metaphysical thoughts do not constitute a religion as such. It is more accurate to assess his religious thought as we have tried to show here as being consistent with the temperament and yearnings of romantic poetry, with art and faith as the fundamental metaphors.
