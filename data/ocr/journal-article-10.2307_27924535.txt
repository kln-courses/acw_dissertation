<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sumerian Historiography* S. . KRAMER University of Pennsylvania Museum Philadelphia, Pa. The Sumerians, it is safe to say, produced no historiography in the generally accepted sense of the word. Certainly no Sumerian man of letters wrote history as the modern historian conceives it, in terms of unfolding processes and underlying principles. Bound by his particular world-view, the Sumerian thinker saw historical events as coming ready-made and 'full-grown, full-blown' on the world scene, and not as the slow product of man's interaction with his environment. He believed, for example, that his own country Sumer, which he knew as a land of thriving cities and towns, villages and farms, in which flour ished a well developed assortment of political, religious, and economic insti tutions and techniques, had always been more or less the same from the very beginning of days?that is, from the moment the gods had planned and decreed it to be so, following the creation of the universe. That Sumer had once been desolate marshland with but few scattered settlements, and had only gradually come to be what it was after many generations of struggle and toil, marked by human will and determination, man-laid plans and experiment and diverse fortunate discoveries and inventions?such thoughts probably never occurred even to the most learned of the Sumerian sages. Moreover, the psychological techniques of definition and generalization which the modern historian takes more or less for granted seem to be unknown to the Sumerian teacher and thinker, at least on the level of explicit formulation. Thus, in the linguistic field, we have quite a number of Sumerian grammatical lists and these imply an awareness of numerous grammatical classifications, but nowhere do we find a single explicit grammatical definition or rule. In mathematics we find many tables, problems and solutions, but no statement of general principles, axioms and theorems. In what might be termed the 'natural sciences', the Sumerian teachers compiled long lists of trees, plants, animals and stones ; the reason for the particular order of the objects listed is * This paper is published in Hebrew in Eretz-Israel, 3, 1953 (Cassutor Memorial Volume), pp. 51-57. 217</page><page sequence="2">218 S.N.KRAMER still bbscure, but certainly it does not stem from a fundamental understanding of botanical, zoological, or mineralogical principles and laws. The Sumerians compiled numerous law-codes, containing no doubt in their original complete state hundreds of individual laws, but nowhere is there a statement of legal theory. The Sumerian myths, hymns and proverbs reveal quite a number of accepted religious beliefs and ethical practices, but nowhere are these formu lated in philosophical or theological terms.1 Just so, in the field of history, the Sumerian temple and palace archivists noted and wrote down a varied assort ment of significant events of a political, military and religious character?the well known date-formulae illustrate this clearly. But this did not lead to the writing of connected and meaningful history; lacking the relatively recently discovered insight that history is a constantly changing process, and seemingly ignorant of the methodological tool of comprehensive generalization, history in the modern sense of the word was a psychological impossibility for the Sumerian literature. Now while it is not surprising, in view of what has just been said, that the Sumerian men of letters failed to produce a 'modern' type of historiography, it does seem rather strange that even historical works of the kind current among the Hebrews and Greeks were unknown in Sumer. In fact, no Sumerian writer or scribe, as far as we know, ever made a conscious effort to write a cultural or political history of Sumer or any of its component states, let alone of the then known world. To be sure, the Sumerian men of letters had originated and developed quite a number of written literary genres: myths and epic tales, hymns and lamentations, proverbs and essays, and several of these?the epics and lamentations in particular?do utilize to a very limited extent what might be termed historical data. But the thought of j&gt;reparing a connected history, prompted either by the love of learning or eveaby what we would call purposes of propaganda, never seemed to occur to the Sumerian teachers and writers.2 The documents that come closest to history in our sense are the votive inscrip 1 There is the possibility of course that the Sumerian teachers and sages did resort to some sort of definition and generalization in their discussions and in their oral explanations to the students and disciples for whose benefit the lists were compiled as scribal 'text-books', but because of the very nature of the problem this will always remain a moot point. * There is also now available a fragmentary text dating from about 1700 B.C. which contains what seems to be a legendary chronicle of the events leading up to the rise to power of Sargon t?e Great of Akkad; cf. Textes religieux sum?riens du Louvre, II, No. 73 and a newly excavated and still unpublished small tablet from Nippur. But from the brief extract of the text available at the moment, it is difficult to assess its historical significance and value.</page><page sequence="3">SUMERIAN HISTORIOGRAPHY 219 tions on statues, stelae, cones, cylinders, vases, tablets, etc., but the events re corded on them are merely a by-product of the urge to find favour with the gods The inscriptions usually record single contemporaneous events, and these in very brief form. Nevertheless there are several among them which do refer back to earlier circumstances and events, and these reveal a sense of his torical detail which for that early date?about 2400 B.c. according to the short chronology?is without parallel in man's recorded past. Before turning to these documents, however, it is essential to have some idea of the world-view which permeates them, otherwise their contents will remain obscure and their style unintelligible. The cosmos, according to Sumerian philosophers and theologians, was created, guided and controlled in accordance with the well-laid plans and duly prescribed laws of a divine pantheon which consisted of a large group of in visible living beings, man-like in form, but superhuman and immortal. The cosmic realms, the astral bodies, the atmospheric forces, the earth's natural and cultural phenomena ? all these were deemed to be in the charge of one or another anthropomorphic deity who guided their activities in accordance with special rules and regulations. This pantheon was conceived to function as an assembly with a king at its head, and the most important groups within it were the four creating deities, who had but to lay their plans, say the word, and it came to be, the seven gods who 'decree the fates', and the fifty deities known as the 'great gods'. Man was created for one purpose only: to serve the gods by supplying them with food, drink, and shelter, so that they might have full leisure for their divine activities. To ensure the success of this plan, the gods established lands and cities, appointed one or another of the pantheon as the divine ruler of each, and these in turn selected their human representa tives. Furthermore, in order to make the cultural entities and phenomena which constitute what is generally described as 'civilization' operate smoothly and effectively, the gods devised a set of rules or regulations, known to the Sumerians by the word me: there were trie's to guide and control the office of kingship, the priestly officials, the ritual paraphernalia, the arts and crafts, some of the more important mental and emotional human attitudes, as well as sundry beliefs and dogmas ; in fact there were me's for each of the hundred-odd elements which, according to the ancient Sumerian thinkers, constituted their fabric of culture.8 Foi a more detailed discussion of the Sumerian world-view, cf. Journ. Cuneiform. Stud., 2, 1948, }9 ff. As for the me s, the following is the legible and more intelligible portion of the list in the</page><page sequence="4">220 S. . KRAMER world-view of this kind, satisfied with the superficial explanation that all events and phenomena can be produced ready-made and without further ado by the command of the gods, offers little intellectual incentive for an historical approach which seeks to interpret events in terms of man and his achievements over the centuries. In spite of this psychological limitation, there came to the fore in Sumer as early as the twenty-fifth century B.c.4 a group of writers who succeeded in fusing their theological world-view with their drive for historical fact in such a way as to produce a fascinating if sketchy record of a number of political, military, and economic incidents spread over several generations. These early 'historians' lived in Lagash, a city in southern Sumer which from about 2500 B.c. played a dominant political and military role for over a century. It was the seat of an active dynasty of rulers, founded by Ur-Nanshe and in cluding Ur-Nanshe*s conquering grandson Eannatum, who for a brief period succeeded in making himself ruler of almost all Sumer and what later came to be known as Akkad,5 Eannatum's brother Enannatum, and the latter's son En temena. It was not until the reign of Urukagina, the eighth ruler after Ur Nanshe, that Lagash's star finally set; Urukagina was defeated by Lugalzaggisi of Umma, who was in turn conquered by the great Sargon of Akkad. It is the political history of this period, from the days of Ur-Nanshe to those of Uru kagina, that is known to us from a varied group of contemporary records pre pared by anonymous 'historians' who, presumably as palace and temple archi exact order given by the ancient Sumerian writers themselves: high-priesthood; godship; the ex alted and enduring crown ; the throne of kingship ; the exalted sceptre ; the royal weapon (?) ; the exalted dais; shepherdship; kingship; lasting queenship; the office of high priestess; (the priestly offices) ishib, lumah, and gutug; truth; descent into the nether world (i.e. death); ascent from the nether world (i.e. resurrection) ; (the eunuchs) kurgarra, girbadara and sagursag; the (battle) standard ; the flood; weapons (?); sexual intercourse; prostitution; legal (?) speech; libel (?); art; the cult chamber (?); 'hierodule of heaven'; the oracle (?); music; eldership; heroism; power; enmity; straightforwardness; the destruction of cities; lamentation; rejoicing of the heart; falsehood; the rebel land; goodness; justice ; craft of the woodworker, metal worker, scribe, smith, leatherworker, builder, and basket-weaver; wisdom ; attention; holy purification; fear; terror; strife; peace; weariness ; victory; counsel; the troubled heart; judgment; decision; (the musical instruments) lilts, ub, mesi, and ala.

Two of these records are outstanding in their fulness of detail and clarity of meaning, and these may well serve to illustrate the style, method, and mood of Sumerian historiography.6 The first document was prepared by one of the archivists of Entemena, the fifth in the line of Lagash rulers starting with Ur-Nanshe ; the text was found inscribed in almost identical language on two clay cylinders.7 Its primary purpose is to record the restoration of the boundary ditch between Lagash and Umma, which had been destroyed in the course of the most recent struggle between the two cities. But in order to set the event in its proper historical perspective, the archivist deemed it advisable to describe the political back ground. He therefore proceeds to recount, very briefly to be sure, some of the more important details in the struggle for power between Lagash and Umma from as far back as his written records reached?i.e., from the days of Mesilim, who was suzerain of Sumer and Akkad about 2600 B.c. In doing so, however, he does not use the straight factual form of narrative writing expected of the historian. Instead he strives to fit the historical events into the accepted frame work of his theocratic world-view, and thus evolves a unique literary style which constantly interweaves the deeds of men and gods and often fails to dis tinguish between them. As a consequence, the actual historical incidents are not readily apparent from the text of the document, but must be painstakingly extracted and discriminatingly rounded out and filled in with the help of rele vant data obtained from other Sumerological sources. Cleared of its theological cloak and polytheistic phraseology, the document records the following series of political events in the history of Sumer, which can be verified in large part from other extant sources.8 6 To date, practically all this 'historical' material comes from Lagash, modern Tello, which the French have excavated on and off for more than half a century. But there is every reason to believe that similar 'historical' documents were prepared in a number of Sumerian cities which still await the hand of the excavator. As for the Lagash material, most of it was copied with superb care and accuracy by the late Fran?ois Thureau-Dangin. For full details of the Lagash excavations, cf. the very useful volume Tello, recently published by Andr? Parrot (Paris, 1948). 7 For the text of one of these cylinders, cf. F. Thureau-Dangin : Die sumerischen und akkadischen K?nigs inschriften (henceforth SAK), p. 36 ff; for the other, cf. Nies and Keiser: Historical, Religious and Economic Texts, No. 1. There also exists a fragmentary duplicating excerpt which is part of a longer text probably written in the days of Urukagina, cf. SAK, p. 54 ff; also infra, n. 28. 8 The summary analysis of the contents of this document and the literal translation which follows are based almost entirely on Arno Poebel's paper in Oriental Studies dedicated to Paul Haupt, pp. 220-271.</page><page sequence="6">222 S. KRAMER la the days when Mesilim was king of Kish, and therefore at least the nominal suzerain of Sumer and Akkad, there arose a border dispute between Lagash and Umma, two Sumerian city states which evidently acknowledged Mesilim as their overlord. The latter proceeded to arbitrate the controversy by measuring off a boundary line between the two cities in accordance with what was given out to be an oracle of Sataran, a deity in charge of settling complaints. He also erected an inscribed stele to mark the spot and prevent future dis putes. However, the decision (which was presumably accepted by both parties) seemed to favour Lagash rather than Umma. In any case, not long afterwards Ush, an ishakku of Umma, violated the terms of the decision ; the time is not stated, but there are indications that this violation took place not long before Ur-Nanshe founded his dynasty at Lagash. Ush ripped out Mesilim's stele to indicate that he was not bound by its terms, and then crossed the border and seized the northernmost territory belonging to Lagash, known as the Guedinna. This land remained in the hands of the Ummaites until the days of Eannatum, the grandson of Ur-Nanshe, a military leader of note whose conquests had made him so powerful that he dared assume, at least for a brief period, the title 'king of Kish', and thus claim the overlordship of all Sumer and Akkad. It was this Eannatum, according to our document, who attacked and defeated the Ummaites, made a new border treaty with Enakalli, then the ishakku of Umma, dug a ditch in line with the new boundary which would help ensure the fertility of the Guedinna, erected there for the purpose of future record the old Mesilim stele, as well as several stelae of his own, and also constructed a number of buildings and shrines to several of the more important Sumerian deities. Moreover, to help minimize a possible source of future conflict between Umma and Lagash, he set aside a strip of fallow land on the Umma side of the bound ary ditch as a kind of no-man's land.9 Finally Eaiinatum, probably in an effort to alleviate the feelings of the Ummaites to some extent, since he was eager to expand his conquests in other directions, agreed to let them farm the fields lying in the Guedinna and even further south. But, he granted this only on condition that they pay the Lagash rulers a share of the crops for the use of the land, thus assuring himself and his successors of a considerable revenue. Thus far Entemena's archivist has dealt only with past events in the conflict between Umma and Lagash He now turns to the most recent struggle between ?

(supra, .7)</page><page sequence="7">SUMERIAN HISTORIOGRAPHY 223 the cities, of which he was in all probability a contemporary witness?th? battle between Ur-Lumma, the son of the unfortunate Enakalli, who had been compelled to agree to Eannatum's 'shameful* terms, and Entemena, the son of Enannatum, and nephew of Eannatum. For in spite of Eannatum's mighty victory over the Ummaites, it took them only a generation or so to recover their confidence, if not their former strength. In any case Ur-Lumma repudiated the bitterly rankling agreement with Lagash, and refused to pay Enannatum the revenue imposed upon Umma. He then proceeded to 'dry up' the boundary ditches; ripped out and set fire to both Mesilim's and Eannatum's stelae with their irritating inscriptions; and destroyed the buildings and shrines which Eannatum had built along the boundary ditch to warn the Ummaites that they must not trespass on Lagash territory. He was now set to cross the border and enter the Guedinna. Further to assure himself of victory, he sought and obtained the military aid of the non-Sumerian ruler to the north of Sumer who, no doubt under the title 'king of Kish,' laid claim to the suzerainty of the entire land of Sumer and Akkad. The two forces met in the Gana-ugigga of the Guedinna, not far south pf the border. The Ummaites and their allies were under the command of Ur-Lumma himself, while the Lagashites were led by Entemena, since his father Enannatum must have been quite an old man at the time. The Lagashites were victorious ; Ur-Lumma fled, hotly pursued by Enteme na and many of his troops were waylaid and killed. But Entemena's victory proved to be ephemeral. Upon Ur-Lumma's defeat and probable death, a new enemy appeared on the scene: II, the sanga10 or temple-head of a city probably named Hallab, situated not far to the north of Umma. This II had evidently been shrewd enough to 'wait it out' while Ente mena and Ur-Lumma were struggling for a decision. But as soon as the battle was over, he attacked the victorious Entemena, met with initial success, and penetrated deep into Lagash territory. To be sure, he was unable to hold on to his gains south of the Umma-Lagash border. But he did succeed in making himselt tshakku of Umma. He then proceeded to show his contempt for the Lagash claims in almost the same manner as his predecessor. He deprived the boundary ditches of the water so essential to the irrigation of the nearby fields and farms, and refused to pay all but a fraction of the revenue imposed upon Umma by the old Eannatum treaty. And when Entemena sent envoys to him 10 At this period the sanga of a temple was probably its arJrrnnisfr'irive head while the en or 'high priest' was its spiritual head.</page><page sequence="8">224 S. . KRAMER demarfding an explanation for his unfriendly acts, he answered by arrogantly claiming the entire Guedinna as his territory and domain. The issue between II and Entemena, however, was not decided by war. Instead a compromise seems to have been forced upon them by a third party, probably once again the northern ruler who claimed overlordship over Sumer and Akkad as a whole. By and large the decision seemed to favour Lagash, since the old Mesilim? Eannatum line was retained as the fixed boundary between Umma and Lagash. On the other hand, nothing is said of compensation by the Ummaites for the revenue which they had withheld. Nor do they seem to be held responsible any longer for ensuring the water-supply of the Guedinna; this task is now up to the Lagashites themselves. As was stated earlier, the preceding r?sum? of the historical events marking the struggle for power between Lagash and Umma is by no means self-evident from a first study of the text of our document; much of it is derived from what may be described as reading between the lines. The following literal translation of the inscription as a whole will help to show how this was done, and at the same time give the reader some idea of the rather unusual historio graphie style developed by the Sumerian men of letters : ,11 the king of all the lands, the father of all the gods, marked off the boundary for Ningirsu and Shara by his steadfast word, (and) Mesilim, the king of Kish, measured it off in accordance with the word of Sataran, (and) erected a stele there. (But) Ush,the ishakku of Umma violated (both) the decree (of the gods) and the word (given by man to man), ripped out its (the boundary's) stele, and entered the plain of Lagash. (Then) did Ningirsu, E s foremost warrior, do battle with (the men of) Umma in accordance with his (Enlil's) straightforward word ; by the word of Enlil he hurled the great Shush-net upon them,12 and heap ed up their skeleton (?) piles in the plain in their (various) places. (As a result) Eannatum, the ishakku of Lagash, the uncle of Entemena, the ishakku of Lagash, marked off the boundary with Enakalli, the ishakku of Umma; led out its (the 11 Enlil is the leading deity of the Sumerian pantheon (d.Journ. Amer. Orient. Soc, 63,1943, p. 194, n. 10, for the connotation of the phrase 'king of all the lands') ; Ningirsu and Shara are the tutelary deities of Lagash and Umma respectively. The sentence states the current belief that after the creation of the world, the two cities were allotted to the two gods as their personal possession and property, and that Enlil himself as the head of the gods had drawn the boundary lines between them. Evidently the author had no written records or oral tradition for the history of Lagash and Umma preceding the days of Mesilim, and therefore resorts to a general statement in conform ity with the accepted world-view 12 For an attempt to represent this act pictorially cf.

The occasion of the inscription was the digging of a small canal by Urukagina, the unfortunate ruler of Lagash whose reign was terminated when its relentless enemies, the Ummaites, sacked the city and burned many of its public build ings. But the dedication of the canal, the actual reason for the inscription, is confined to a few sentences at the very end of the text. By far the larger part of the inscription is taken up with a detailed statement of a civic event which may well be described as the first social reform inman's recorded history .This reform which according to our anonymous author resulted from a change of administration due to the selection of Urukagina as ruler of Lagash, was directed against the abuses of Tormer days/ particularly the flourishing of an obnoxious and ubi quitous bureaucracy, high taxation, and the appropriation by the palace of property belonging to the temple. Indeed, if we are to believe our ancient chronicler, Lagash had become the victim of a general state of lawlessness and oppression, and it took Urukagina to restore law and order in the city, and to 'establish the freedom* of its citizens. Before considering the actual text of the document, a background sketch, ever so brief to be sure, of Lagash's political, economic and social structure might be of value.28 The state of Lagash in the early third millenium B.c. consisted of a small group of prosperous towns, each clustering about a temple. Nominally the city of Lagash, like the other Sumerian city-states, was under the overlordship of the king of the entire land of Babylonia.24 Actually its secular ruler was the ishakkuy who ruled the city as the representative of the tutelary deity to whom, according to their world-view, it had been allotted after the creation. Just how the earlier ishakku's came to power is uncertain ; it may well be that they were selected by the freemen of the city, among whom the temple administrators, the sanga's, played a leading political role.26 In any case, the office became 13 This background statement which emphasizes the prevalence of private ownership and individual enterprise in the early Sumerian city-state should be treated by the reader as highly tentative since the evidence at our disposal is very limited. Practically all the relevant inscriptional material comes from temples and other buildings, and not from private houses, and consequently the impression has gained ground that the Lagash city-state practised a kind of theocratic communism. In Fara (ancient Shuruppak), however, where private houses were excavated, the tablets indicate that private ownership was the rule. Note, too, that the Enhegal tablet (Barton, PubL Babylonian Sect., Univ. Mus., Univ. of Pennsylvania, IX, No. 2) seems to treat of the sale of land. Our reform-document, moreover, speaks even of the poox as owners of fields, houses, donkeys, and fisheries. 14 Cf. supra, . 5. " Cf. T. Jacobsen: Primitive Democracy in Ancient Mesopotamia, JNES, 2,1943, pp. 159-172, and</page><page sequence="12">228 S. . KRAME? hereditary in the course of time.26 Moreover, the more ambitious and successful of the ishakku s naturally tended to augment theirpowerand wealth at the expense of the temple, and this, as will soon become evident, led at times to a struggle for power between temple and palace. Most of the inhabitants of Lagash were farmers and cattle breeders, boatmen and fishermen, merchants and craftsmen. Its economy was mixed, part socialistic and state-controlled, part capitalistic and free. In theory, the soil belonged to the city god, and therefore presumably to his temple which held it in trust for all the citizens. In actual practice, while the temple corporation owned a good deal of land which it rented out to some of the people as sharecroppers, much of the soil was the private property of the indi vidual citizen; even the poor owned farms and gardens, houses and cattle. Moreover because of Lagash's hot, rainless climate, the supervision of the ir rigation projects and water-works which were absolutely essential to the life and welfare of the entire community, necessarily had to be communally admin istered. But in many other respects the economy was relatively free and un hampered. Riches and poverty, success and failure were, at least to some ex tent, the result of private enterprise and individual drive. The more industrious of the artisans and craftsmen sold their hand-made products in the free town market. Travelling merchants carried on a thriving trade with the surrounding states by land and sea, and it is not unlikely that some of these merchants were private individuals rather than temple representatives. The citizens of Lagash were conscious of their civil rights, and wary of any government action which tended to abridge their economic and personal freedom, which they cherished as a heritage essential to their way of life. It was this 'freedom' which the Lagash citizens had lost, according to our ancient reform document, in the days before Urukagina's reign, and which was restored by him when he came to power. Of the events which led to the lawless and oppressive state of affairs, there is not a hint in the document. But we may well surmise that it was the direct S.N.Kramer: Gilgamesh and Agga, Amer. Journ. ArcbaeoL, 53, 1949, pp. 1-18, where it is shown that in very early Sumerian days the city-states had an assembly of elders as well as one of the arms-bearing males. No trace of these assemblies is found in the available Lagash material which dates from a considerably later period in Sumerian history. In addition to freemen, there were of course also many slaves among the inhabitants of Sumer. But there is no trace in the available material from Lagash of the existence of the mushk?nu, a social category intermediate between freemen and slaves.

Smitten with grandiose ambitions for themselves and their state, some of these rulers resorted to imperialistic' wars and bloody conquests. In a few cases they met with considerable success, and for a brief period one of them actually ex tended the sway of Lagash over Babylonia as a whole, and even over several of the neighbouring states.27 The earlier victories proved ephemeral, however, and in less than a century Lagash was reduced to its earlier boundaries and former status. By the time Urukagina came to power, Lagash had been so weakened that it was easy prey for its unrelenting enemy to the north, the city state of Umma. It was in the course of these cruel wars and their tragic aftermath that the citizens of Lagash found themselves deprived of their political and economic freedom. For in order to raise armies and supply them with arms and equip ment, the rulers found it necessary to infringe on the personal rights of the individual citizen, to tax his wealth and property to the limit, and to appro priate property belonging to the temple as well. Under the impact of war, they met with little opposition. And once power was in its hands, the palace coterie showed itself most unwilling to relinquish the domestic controls, even in times of peace. For these had proved highly profitable; indeed our ancient bureaucrats had devised a variety of sources of revenue and income, taxes and imposts, which in some ways might well be the envy of their modern coun terparts. But let the hoary Sumenan historian who lived in Lagash some 4500 years ago, and was therefore a contemporary of the events, tell the story more or less in his own words (PI. 14):28 The inspector of the boatmen seized the boats. The cattle inspector seized the large cattle, seized the small cattle. The fisheries inspector seized the fisheries.29 When a citizen of Lagash brought a 27 For Eannatum and his military successes, cf. supra, p. 222. 28 The text of the reform document is inscribed in practically identical versions on two cones (B and C), cf. SAK, p. 46 ff. A variant of the same document is found on a fragmentary cone (A), cf. SAK, p. 44. A more widely divergent version of the text has been found inscribed on a partially preserved oval plaque which also contains a part of Entemena's historical document treated above; this plaque is attributed to Urukagina although his name is not found in the available text. Apart from SAK, translations of the document will be found e.g. in Barton: The Royal Inscriptions of Sumer and Akkad, p. 74 ff. and Deimel, Orient?lta, 2, p. 3 ff.

If a perfumer made an oil-preparation, the ishakku got five shekels, the vizier got one shekel, and the palace-steward got another shekel. As for the temple and its property* the ishakku took it over as his own. To quote our ancient narrator: The oxen of the gods ploughed the ishakku s onion-patches ; the onion and cucumber patches of the ishakku were located in the god's best fields.' In addition, the more important temple officials, particu larly the sanga's, were deprived of many of their donkeys and oxen, as well as of much of their grain.81 Even death brought no relief from levies and taxes. When a dead man was brought to the cemetery for burial, quite a number of officials83 and parasites made it their business to be on hand to relieve the bereaved family of quanti ties of barley, bread and date-wine, and various furnishings. From one end of the state to the other, our venerable reporter observes bitterly, 'there were the tax-collectors.'88 No wonder then, that the palace waxed fat and prosperous. Its lands and properties formed one vast, continuous and unbroken estate. In the literal words of our Sumerian commentate , The houses of the ishakku and the fields of the ishakku, the houses of the palace harem and the fields of the palace harem, the houses of the palace nursery and the fields of the palace nursery crowded each other side to side.'84 At this low point in the political and social affairs of Lagash, our Sumerian chronicler tells us, a new and god-fearing ruler came to the fore, Urukagina by name, who restored justice and freedom to the long-suffering citizens.86 He removed the inspector of the boatmen from the boats. He removed the cattle inspector from the cattle, large and small. He removed the fisheries inspector from the fisheries. He removed the qpllector of the silver which had to be paid for the shearing of the white sheep.86 When a man divorced his M Cf. Ovale Platte ii 15 ff. 11 Cf.

When a perfumer made an oil-preparation, neither the ishakku nor the vizier nor the palace-steward got anything.87 When a dead man was brought to the cemetery for burial the officials received considerably less of the dead man's goods than formerly, in some cases a good deal less than half.88 Temple property was now highly re spected. From one end of the land to the other, our on-the-spot reporter observes, 'there was no tax-collector.'89 He, Urukagina, 'established the freedom' of the citizens of Lagash.40 But removing the ubiquitous revenue collectors and the parasitic officials was not Urukagina's only achievement. He also put a stop to the injustice and exploitation suffered by the poor at the hands of the rich. For example, sup posing 'the house of a lowly man was next to the house of a 'big man', and the 'big man' said to him, want to buy it from you'. If when he (the 'big man') was about to buy it from him, the lowly man said, 'pay me as much as I think fair,' and then he (the 'big man') does not buy it, that 'big man' must not 'take it out' on the lowly man.'41 Urukagina also cleared the city of usurers, thieves and murderers. If, for instance, 'a poor man's son laid out a fishing pond, no one would now steal its fish.'42 No wealthy official dared trespass in the garden of a 'poor man's mother', to pluck the trees, and carry off their fruit, as had been their wont.48 As for the widow and the orphan, Urukagina made a special covenant with Ningirsu, the god of Lagash, that he would not permit them to be victimized by the 'men of power'.44 How helpful and effective were these reforms in the struggle for power be tween Lagash and Umma? Unfortunately, they failed to bring about the expect ed strength and victory, and in spite of our ancient historian's enthusiastic eulogies, Urukagina and his reforms were soon 'gone with the wind'. Like many another reformer, he seemed to have come too late with too little. In any case his reign lasted less than ten years, he and his city were soon over 87 Cf. Ovale Platte iii 1-4, and the immediately preceding part of the lacuna between columns ii and iii which is to be restored in accordance with ii 15 ff. 88 Cf. Kegel and C ix 26.

KRAMER whelme^ by Lugalzaggisi, the ambitious ruler of nearby Umma45 who succeed ed at least for a very brief period46 in making himself king of all Babylonia. 4i The sack of Lagash is described in an inscription on a clay tablet which provides a revealing glimpse of one aspect of the Sumerian philosophy of life. After listing some twenty temples and other public buildings which had been attacked, burned and plundered by the Ummaites, the author, possibly the very individual who wrote the reform document, concludes with the consoling thought that the Ummaites, in destroying Lagash, had committed a sin against Lagash's tutelary deity Ningirsu who sooner or later will make them pay for their misdeed. It is not Urukagina's sin, the author asserts toward the end of his inscription, but that of Lugalzaggisi, and therefore 'may his (Lugalzaggisi's) (personal) deity (the goddess) Nidaba, bear the responsibility for that sin.' In brief, our author had such firm faith in Urukagina's blamelessness in the struggle with Lugalzaggisi, and so sure was he of his theological premises, that he did not hesitate to point an accusing finger at a deity such as Nidaba, who, though not one of the leading deities of the Sumerian pantheon, played quite an important role in it as the goddess of writing and wisdom. 46 In connection with Sumerian historiography, mention should be made of the Sumerian 'king list,' a document purporting to list in the form of successive dynasties the names of all kings who had ever ruled over Babylonia, from the very beginning of kingship to the days of the document's compilation, together with their regnal years. Our available copies of the compendium which seems to have been used as a 'text book' in the scribal schools, practically all date from the early post-Sumerian period, that is, the period following the Third Dynasty of Ur. The reasons for its original compilation, which may date to the days preceding Ur III, are of course unknown ; the first compiler was no doubt motivated, at least in part, by a genuine historical drive to ascertain and record in the form of a summary the dynastic background of his country's past. A careful, thorough, and highly detailed study of the document was published by T. Jacobsen.
