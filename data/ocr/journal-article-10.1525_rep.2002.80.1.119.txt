<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> DAN I EL COTTOM To Love to Hate I When chris burden f ired a pistol at an airliner taking oV from LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) in 1973, he committed an artwork of terri c suggestiveness, one that helped win him a prominent place among his con- temporaries. Perhapsmost obviously, 747 ( g. 1) evoked the cliche ́ of the hero going to any lengths for his art: the isolated individual doing battle with the world, at- tacking its materials (canvas, stone, plastered ceiling, even the in nite heavens) with a passion bordering onmadness. Simultaneously, and maybe even more strongly— judgments will vary—he recalled the antiheroic image of the poe`te maudit: the reck- less immoralist so devoted to aesthetic sensations, in both senses of the word, that he is heedless of the human consequences of his pursuits. (‘‘Burden’s work is terror- ism,’’ one critic has said, approvingly.)1 We might be reminded of the surrealist dictum, carried over from the Dada gang, in which the random  ring of a gun in a crowd was seen as the exemplary aesthetic act. Then again, we might say that while also referencing these other images, Burden portrayed the artist as an utterly abject  gure, a bad boy manque ́ whose futility does not even rise to the level of Don Quixote tilting at windmills, so vulgar is it and so lacking in authenticity. Or more degrading yet, in this moment wemight judge him to have been the artist as anach- ronism, the artist transformed into a degenerate publicityhound pathetically trying to get with the program of popular culture, as represented most centrally by the movies, which—from ‘‘The Great Train Robbery’’ (1903) through gangster dra- mas,  lm noir, John Wayne, James Bond, and the ‘‘Lethal Weapon’’ franchise— oVer us as the image of their compelling power the iconic  gure of a man shooting a gun. Or in yet another alternative, either outweighing or to some degree interre- lated with all these contexts, 747 might be seen as oVering us the image of the male artist heroically, diabolically, abjectly, and anachronistically—not to mention hysterically—trying to assert himself at a moment when the feminist movement was dramatically challenging the phallic brush and genius no less than the gun.2 This context in turn would lead us to other contemporary contexts relevant to the appreciation of this artwork, including the state-sanctioned mass murders of the Vietnam War, which were still fresh in people’s minds at the time.3 Re pre se n tat ions 80 · Fall 2002 q the regent s of the un ivers i ty of ca l i forn ia i s sn 0734-6018 pages 119–138.

Chris Burden, 747, 1973. Photo: courtesy of the artist. There is yet more to this work, of course. For instance, it might be viewed as a re ection—both homage and send-up—of the muscular gesture in ‘‘action paint- ing’’ of the 1940s and 1950s. It would then be an act comparable to Robert Rausch- enberg’s famous erasure of a drawing by Willem de Kooning. The whiV of wimpi- ness in Rauschenberg’s Erased de Kooning (1953)—he obtained the Ab Ex master’s permissionbefore he  ourished his eraser—is also in keeping with Burden’s behav- ior in using a handgun rather than some more formidable weaponry of the sort accessible to terrorists and, onemust presume, suYciently motivated artists. Burden has never really been a terrorist, after all, even though he has deserved to be called ‘‘one of America’s few really scary artists.’’4 Burden’s 747 is an art object that existed as such only in a vanishing instant of 120 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="3"> time now memorialized in its photographic and textual documentation. Conse- quently, his pistol points out two directions, into performance and the simulacrum, that beleagured ‘‘high’’ art has taken from the 1960s to the present day. (The em- phases in this work on art as a conceptual act, on the human body as integral to the work, and on the personal identity of the artist indicate three additional direc- tions that have been pursued.) Yet we are also guided elsewhere, further into the past, into the tradition of landscape art and, more speci cally, into the aesthetics of the sublime. The Burden of 747 then becomes a latter-day wanderer from the canvases of CasparDavid Friedrich, posed against the melancholy horizon, seeking to penetrate its mysteries. The disproportions of scale between the puny human and the transcendental airliner call to mind the Faust legend as it was understood by the Romantics, in which it tells of the danger of overreaching the bounds of one’s nature by desiring to know too much, and also in its more modern, historically speci c understanding, in which scienti c knowledge and its characteristic product, technology, are the most profound temptations to the human spirit. ( If you want an image of Martin Heidegger’s Dasein, Burden gives it to you.) In this regard, how- ever, Burden’s performance still leads us into equivocation: for if his was in some sense an act reaYrming the divide between technology and spirit, science and art, impersonal knowledge and human vitality, and all the other oppositions apper- taining to these, it was also an act that solicited our epistemophilia, and in the most basic empirical terms. Is the photo ‘‘real’’?5 (This question becomes all the more pressing if one now thinks of the uncanny reversal of Burden’s work in a hoax that was widely distributed over the internet almost immediately after the September 11th attacks: a photograph of a man on the observation deck of the World Trade Center, oblivious to the plane bearing down upon him.) Did he ‘‘really’’ shoot the gun? Was the plane close enough to him at that moment so that it was within the realm of empirical possibility that he might have hit it and, if he hit it just right— just wrong—forced it to crash? We can learn, if we are so inclined, that Burden was visited by the FBI but dismissed from their consideration, evidently, because he was out of range when he  red his gun.6 Like truth, beauty might also be an issue here. As a young man Burden was not, by any ordinarymeasures, an extraordinarily attractive hunk of humanity, and in the snapshot of this event he looks small and scruVy as he stands in his undistin- guished clothes in an equally undistinguished landscape. If we cannot call such a perfectly conceived act ‘‘beautiful,’’ however, then of what use can that word be outside of the inverted commas used to terrorize the taste of those who still believe in a regulative ideal of aesthetic judgment?Much the same questionmight be asked of all the other terms through which we are accustomed to evaluate art, including morality and value. Through its erasure of the line commonly drawn between symbolic and real violence, as through the sorts of uncertainties, equivocations, contradictions, and overdeterminations I have brie y sketched here, Burden’s act drew forth the misan- To Love to Hate 121 </page> <page sequence="4"> thropyof art: its undoing of humanity, its drive to betraywhat Samuel Beckett called ‘‘anthropomorphic insolence,’’ or whatever may be thought of as properly human desires, intentions, and concerns.7 Using Beckett as one of his favored exemplars, Theodor Adorno directed attention to the aesthetic implications of this point (even as he struggled to give it a utopian spin) when he remarked upon the Baudelarian ‘‘spleen’’ of art, without which it cannot be and with which it maintains ‘‘a perma- nent protest against morality.’’8 This is an ancient theme, of course, arguably the most ancient theme of Western aesthetics, and yet one that we continue to play down whenever we try to discipline art into spiritual health by working some sense of responsibility into our theories of what it is, does, and has been. ‘‘Pollyanaesthet- ics’’ was Dorothy Parker’s waspish term for this sort of thing; and for his part Bur- den has  atly stated, ‘‘Art is not about social betterment.’’9 Burden, I would suggest, was not sick but was unhuman when he made 747. He was like those uncanny things-in-the-act-of-becoming-art that are no longer objects, exactly, as they appear to their makers or audiences. At the most banal level, the teacher in the creative writing workship says, ‘‘This poem wants to be a sonnet,’’ or the painter says, in trying to  gure out what the canvas is doing, ‘‘It needs something right there.’’ A more extraordinary case would involve bystanders watching symbols being attacked and, as thousands die, imagining that they are watching a movie. In accordancewith the tradition that Socrates helped to establish in the Phaedo, it has been usual to think of misanthropy quite diVerently. Much as T. E. Hulme termed Romanticism ‘‘spilt religion,’’ both scholars and laypersons have tended to regard misanthropy as spoilt idealism: the  ipside of generosity for Timon of Ath- ens, sincerity for Molie`re’s Alceste, reason for Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver, innocence for Victor Frankenstein’s monster, romantic love for Dorothy Parker, and so on.10 As was pointed out by Se ́bastien-Roch-Nicolas Chamfort, a prominent misan- thrope in his day despite his role as an enthusiastic ‘‘friend of humanity’’ during the French Revolution, misanthropy is then not really distinct from fellow-feeling: ‘‘To have a correct idea of things, it is necessary to take words in a sense opposite to that which they are given in the world. Misanthropist, for example, means phi- lanthropist.’’11 (This is the tradition that Thomas Love Peacock satirized in Night- mare Abbey [1818] through the words of a Kantian metaphysician, Mr. Flosky: ‘‘I do not take any interest in any person or thing on the face of the earth; which sentiment, if you analyse it, you will  nd to be the quintessence of the most re ned philanthropy.’’)12 Misanthropy thus construed is what one of Friedrich Schiller’s characters describes it to be: a condition that places one in a critical position be- tween ‘‘humanity and humans.’’13Works that take misanthropy as an explicit topic always lend themselves to this kind of judgment at least to some extent, and criticism that accepts this invitation does have its pertinence as it traces out the fashions and histories of this attitude, as it may then be called. To stop there, however, is to stay comfortablywith the terms of humanity and thus, like Hulme,  nally not to experi- 122 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="5"> ence these works as art at all.14 In contrast, Burden’s performance leads us to see the constitutivemisanthropy at work in the very conception of art: its appeal to the realm of the unhuman, which includes not only the domains of brute material events and of cultural representations but also of identi cations with things such as leaders, gods, consumer goods, planes, skyscrapers, and movies. The Other Vietnam Memorial (1991) is a more recent work of Burden’s that helps to establish this argu- ment. Through this mock monument Burden drew out the  erce misanthropy in Maya Lin’s beloved wall—before which hundreds of thousands of Americans con- tinue to lay down oVerings as they rub it, embrace it, photograph it, kneel in front of it, shed tears near it—by reminding us of the names of themillions of Vietnamese that this wall symbolically and, in eVect, violently erases. More recently, and per- haps even more controversially, the artist Dread Scott has followed Burden’s exam- ple in a work titled (and dramatizing the equivoque in the term) Enduring Freedom (2002), a shrine based on those created in New York City in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks but devoted to the Afghan casualties of the war the United States is conducting in response to them. One need not necessarily be an artist, self-designated or otherwise, to appreci- ate the calling of this misanthropy. It is not only a question of art. Throughout his writings Beckett, for instance, would have it that this calling lies in wait for just about everyone. Thus, the protagonist ofWatt, troubled over a potlike thing—‘‘It resembled a pot, it was almost a pot, but it was not a pot of which one could say, Pot, pot, and be comforted’’— nds his own humanity equally at issue because of ‘‘this inde nable thing that prevented him from saying, with conviction, and to his relief, of the object that was so like a pot, that it was a pot, and of the creature that still in spite of everything presented a large number of exclusively human character- istics, that it was a man.’’15 Of interest in regard to this issue of classi cation is one of the most distinctive features of Burden’s LAX performance: that it was carried out in the almost complete absence of recognizable aesthetic frames. Although a witness took a snapshot, there was no audience or theater in the usual senses of these words, no curtains or stirring music or other signs to indicate the event’s be- ginning and end, and no formal conventions by which to judge its quality or success except, perhaps, the trope of paradox. (For if he had ‘‘succeeded,’’ he surely would have ‘‘failed’’; his act would have been a horri c crime, not an amazingly canny artwork.) Moreover, although the event gave rise to various kinds of commentary and documentation, including Burden’s own testimony about it, it did not result in an object that could be displayed in a gallery or enshrined in a museum, and if someone were to attempt to reproduce it today, it is clear that the performance, which would certainly end in imprisonment for all concerned, would scarcely re- semble the original. Furthermore, the artist’s touch played no part in that original event (any fool can  re a gun); and in fact it cannot even be taken for granted that in  ring the gun, Burden acted as an artist ( lots of people  re guns into the sky to celebrate an occasion, to express anger, to let oV steam, or for other reasons that To Love to Hate 123 </page> <page sequence="6"> seem appropriate at the time). Perhaps it resembles art, it is almost art, but it is not an art of which one can say, Art, art, and be comforted. And it was ever thus, or so I take Burden to have suggested. If ever such a thing as art should be, it cannot be radically distinguished from ordinary perceptions, acts, and deeds, even though it cannot be entirely coincident with them. What marks it out is the misanthropic appeal that goes to work on us in any experience that somehow takes us out of ‘‘it’’: the world, the self, living matter, whatever is as- sumed for the moment to  gure as the commonality of humanity. In this regard, another of Burden’s early works, in which he had himself cruci ed on the back of a Volkswagen Beetle (Trans-Fixed, 1974),may be usefully juxtaposedwith his assault on the airliner. The sadomasochistic extremes he marked out with these two works, in which the artist is variably killer and sacri ce, terrorist and victim, evil and re- demption—all in the context of mundanemodernity—evoke the immemorial reli- gious traditions, themes, functions, and contexts of art in all their horror, sublimity, and banality.16One thinks of the elegant misanthropy of Jorge Luis Borges’s ‘‘Baby- lon Lottery,’’ which echoes passages fromThomasDeQuincey’s opiumnightmares and fromCharles Baudelaire’s Flowers of Evil: ‘‘Like all men in Babylon, I have been a proconsul; like all, a slave; I have also known omnipotence, opprobrium, jail.’’17 Like other early works by Burden, such as the one in which he con ned himself for several days in a small UC Irvine locker with nothing but a  ve-gallon jug of water available to him from the locker above and a  ve-gallon jug for his urine in the one below (Five Day Locker Piece, 1971), the embodied pun in Trans-Fixed—it is an ‘‘auto’’-cruci xion—calls to mind the misanthropy in ascetic spiritual practices like those performed by early church fathers such as St. Simeon Stylites, whose legend is capable of creeping out even the most devout commentators.18We did not need a cutting-edge artist to tell us that there is an irony built into the act of turning away from humankind, away from ‘‘the world,’’ in the attempt to ful ll one’s hu- manity; the young Simeon’s fellow monks are said to have been so appalled by the creative extremes of his self-morti cation, which included tying a rope around his loins so that it ate into his  esh and opened a ghastly wound festering with worms, that they cast him out from their brotherhood.19 What Burden has oVered us, though, complete with allusions to the historical realities of mass murder (it was a Volkswagen hood, after all), is a vision of misanthropy as the very stuV of art, to be accepted and explored and worked on as such, lest art and non-art alike should oVer us the dismal ‘‘comfort’’ of the real thing. II A familiar viewwould have it that FranzKafka’s hunger artist represents the last term in a series of asceticisms. The legacy of stoic soldiers and athletes, Christian anchorites, and Romantic artists peters oV into this performerwho allows 124 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="7"> an entrepreneur to make a spectacle out of the sight of his aske ̄sis—that is, until the market for such things fails and he is led to contemplate the futility of his discipline. From this sort of viewpoint, the hunger artist participates in various allegories, which tell of the death of a traditional ideal of art in the commodied circumstances of modern life; the meaninglessness of art divorced from the social institutions of polis and church; the incoherence of the self in the absence of sustaining relations with others; and the problem posed by art to a particular writer, ascetic, and Jew. In Sander L. Gilman’s felicitous phrase, ‘‘Kafka’s geek turns out in the end to have been a freak.’’ Therefore, he can also be associated with the rethinking of cultural history represented by the revered freaks of the Symbolist and aestheticist move- ments, such as Joris-Karl Huysmans’s Des Esseintes; with the general perception of cultural and physical degeneration that played itself out in all aspects of modern- ism, including not only literature and art but also  elds such as history, anthropol- ogy, and criminology; and with an aesthetics of high art that was consolidated in this era in marked opposition to (but also through complicity with) femininity, mass culture, popular culture, and middle-class business in general.20 The text does support these sorts of readings, and they have their importance. Similarly, it is important to recognize, as Breon Mitchell has pointed out, that in the late nineteenth century hunger artists were an actual social phenomenonwhose practices and subsequent decline in popularity are tracked with an almost journal- istic  delity in Kafka’s tale.21 With at least as much textual warrant, though, one might see Kafka’s hunger artist as neither historicaloutsider nor historicist exempli-  cation. Instead he may be taken to embody the untimeliness of the misanthropy from which no art can deliver itself. We can know that the hunger artist is not simply an anachronism because all the supposedly contemporary features of his environment—the impure motiva- tions in the world of performing art, the corruptions of commercialism, the vulgar and uncomprehending spectators—were already established as being ‘‘contempo- rary’’ at least as far back as the fourth century. When church fathers took to the wastelands of the Middle East and there lived on pillars, within caves, or even, like St. Theodore Sykeon, in cages, they already had to deal with the question of when ambition might corrupt, rather than help to perfect, the imitatio involved in one’s body art.22 Similarly, just as prospective monks would have to be warned, in medi- eval works such as Piers Plowman and theMyrour of Recluses, against the temptation to adopt the life of a hermit in order to cash in on it, so, too, did the ‘‘athletes of God’’ in the deserts of the fourth and  fth centuries, such as Antony, have to give upmoney due to them and resist Satan’s oVers to replace it with even more.23More- over, in addition to dealing with the faithful who  ocked to see them in their spec- tacular isolation, they had to fend oV tourists who had no proper understanding of their discipline.24 Accordingly, a standard trope in saints’ lives has their followers, and sometimes they themselves, initially being rejected from monkish fellowship before they prove they are deserving of its suVering. Similarly, we learn of those To Love to Hate 125 </page> <page sequence="8"> who had to masquerade as the real thing in order to be accepted, such as women who disguised themselves as men so that they might be able to participate in their discipline. In fact, part of the pleasure in reading saints’ lives comes from ‘‘na’ ̈ve’’ details that suggest just how disturbing the image of misanthropy was bound to appear, no matter how pious it was supposed to be. For instance, when his former brethren, admonished by God, decide they want Simeon back among them, they have to get him back by force, so glad is he to have been cast out into the wilderness. Similarly, in Athanasius’s famous life of St. Antony, we are told how Antony’s twenty years of isolation came to an end when his admirers broke into his enclosure and forcibly dragged him out—even as Kafka’s artist had to be reluctantly taken out of his cage at the end of each performance. Bede told a similar story of how a tearful St. Cuth- bert had to be compelled to leave his eremitic isolation in order to assume the duties of the bishopric to which he had been elected, and in the ‘‘great refusal’’ of the  gure in the Inferno commonly identi ed as Pope Celestine V, who abdicated the papacy after only a few months to return to his life as a hermit, Dante famously made an example of this sort of danger.25 Indeed, all the features of the hunger artist’s story that might identify him as an anachronistic  gure, because they are supposed to indicate the inappropriately modern context in which his art cannot  ourish—the features that establish a context of multiple, ambiguous, corrupt, and futile or grotesque motivations—were already woven into the understanding of the lives of solitaries from the time this type was recognized as such. And just as we can see that he is not an anachronism, from this viewpoint, we can also see that Kafka’s artist is not simply an exempli cation; for the features that would seem to cage him into a particular cultural, social, or historical context also drag him out into others, with the original ‘‘event’’ being aesthetically irretrievable except as an ongoing disturbance in our capacities for aesthetic judgment. To see how fully the suicidal masochism of the hunger artist is also sadistic aggression, not only against any conceivable audience and the nourishment of the species but also in terms of a misanthropic eVect constitutive of art, onemight com- pare his story to what is perhaps Thomas De Quincey’s most famous essay, ‘‘On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts.’’26 Like Chamfort,DeQuincey argues (in the guise of a speaker before the Society of Connoisseurs in Murder) that the conventional opposition between philanthropy and misanthropy is all wrong, but he develops this argument rather diVerently. The terms of philanthropy andmisan- thropy, hemaintains, simply refer to works that are less or more artistic: ‘‘The world in general, gentleman, are very bloody-minded; and all they want in a murder is a copious eVusion of blood; gaudy display in this point is enough for them.’’27 (Here one might think of the gaudy health of the leopard that so comforts the circus audi- ence at the end of ‘‘A Hunger Artist.’’) This is also, one might say, the lesson of Timon: that philanthropy simply awaits the occasion to reveal itself as misanthropy, much as (to compare traditional things with topical) leaders now urge charity upon 126 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="9"> us in the very same lines and images with which they look forward to bloodshed. ‘‘To hear people talk,’’ says De Quincey, ‘‘you would suppose that all the dis- avantages and inconveniences were on the side of being murdered, and that there were none at all in not being murdered. But considerate men think otherwise.’’28 Like Burden andKafka, he makes a performanceout of taking pleasure in drawing out as unsparingly as possible his recognitionof themisanthropy in art. Still writing of murder, he remarks, A philosophic friend, well known for his philanthropy and general benignity, suggests that the subject chosen ought also to have a family of young children wholly dependent on his exertions, by way of deepening the pathos. And, undoubtedly, this is a judicious caution. Yet I would not insist too keenly on such a condition. Severe good taste unquestionably suggests it; but still, where the man was otherwise unobjectionable in point of morals and health, I would not look with too curious a jealousy to a restriction which might have the eVect of narrowing the artist’s sphere.29 Through what one critic has defensively called his ‘‘blandly brazen misappropria- tions of common aesthetic dicta,’’ De Quincey thus proposed a conception of aes- thetics that was heretically upsetting, yes, but also completely faithful to tradition.30 In contrast to De Quincey’s connoisseur, popular imaginationwould hold mis- anthropy to be an extreme and desolate condition: self-lacerating, miserable, and repulsive where it is not pathetic. This is a tale we tell to bind ourselves to the spe- cies: hence the dismay of journalists reporting on theWorld Trade Center and Pen- tagon attacks when they were forced to deal with the fact that the terrorists did not  t the typical pro le of an impoverished, desperate youth brainwashed into a jihad frenzy but instead seemed to be middle-class, educated, and well traveled—at least one even possessed of a wife and children, according to early reports. The terrorists seemed to compound their horri c crime even further, after the fact, by suVering it to be revealed that they had enjoyed an occasional drink, gone to the gym, t in. The media would have been much more comfortable with the stereotypical fanati- cism of a Baudelaire: ‘‘When I have inspired universal disgust and horror, I will have conquered solitude.’’31 III It is entirely  tting that prior to the early twentieth century, theMisan- thrope (c. 1568;  g. 2) of Pieter Brueghel the Elder was cataloged under the title Heresy.32 For misanthropy can be construed as the ultimate and unsurpassable her- esy in the souls, societies, and histories of humankind—as Byron recognized, for instance, in making his Giaour, or in del, yet another type of Cain in his parade of alienated protagonists.With deadening predictability, victims will see terrorists as heretics, even to their own professions of faith, who are driven by an inhuman hatred of humanity, while the terrorists will believe these others are the real source To Love to Hate 127 </page> <page sequence="10"> figure 2.

To remark upon this dreary cliche ́ (‘‘one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom  ghter’’) is by no means to suggest an equivalence between, for instance, the fanatics responsible for the plane hijackings of 11 September 2001 and those who were murdered or otherwise devastated by their actions. On the contrary, this observation is necessary in order to maintain crucial distinctions among persons and amongdeeds. For the purposesofmoral and political judgment, as the constitutive misanthropy of art can teach us, the language of heresy will get us nowhere. In adopting it, we simply undo ourselves, subjecting ourselves to the art of misanthropy as if suddenly placing ourselves as actors on the set of a disaster movie and thus barring ourselves from any chance of communication, aesthetic or otherwise. Even those who seek to domesticate misanthropy as a redemptive withdrawal from the world, from ‘‘society’’ in the popular sense, are compelled to distinguish 128 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="11"> their visions from heretical forms and thus to make war on their own professions. In the case of Johann Georg Zimmermann’s Rousseauian treatise On Solitude, for instance, the heresy involves, among others, Roman Catholic monastics: ‘‘In the solitude of the cloister, through fasting and freezing, midnight choir shrieking, and a thousand loathsome and exasperating feelings, one learns to hate humanity.’’33 Zimmermann’s treatise is a virtual prescription for Friedrich’s paintings, with their scenes of sublime and ennobling solitude, and so we might presume that he would have admired works such as Two Men by the Sea at Moonrise (1817;  g. 3), but we must also presume that The Monk by the Sea (c. 1809;  g. 4) would have proven as unsettling to him as it did to Heinrich vonKleist. Rather than suggesting the ‘‘sweet melancholy’’ of which Zimmermann was so fond, this work would have been more apt to call up Robert Burton’s descriptionof that ‘‘destructive solitariness’’ in which ‘‘sociable creatures become beasts, monsters, inhumane, ugly to behold, Misan- thropi.’’34 SoKleist’s 1810commentary told of the confusionhe felt before this paint- ing, which he described as being at once an occasion of heartwrenching feeling and of damage to the self.35 This example can serve to remind us that, like Zimmermann’s work, the history of Christian ascetism is associated with accusations and counteraccusations of her- esy, and not only in dramatically anti-Catholic works of misanthropy such as Charles RobertMaturin’sMelmoth the Wanderer. (Flannery O’Connor, for one, freely acknowledged as much when she suVered 1 Corinthians 15:31, ‘‘I die daily,’’ to be translated into the idiomof themurderousMis t in ‘‘AGoodMan IsHard to Find’’: ‘‘She would of been a good woman . . . if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.’’)36 Just as art cannot be describedwithout raising the issue of misanthropy, there is no way that misanthropy can be described, no matter how ‘‘aesthetic,’’ that will triumph over the question of heresy. The fact that art teaches us that we live in the company of misanthropes, that we must actually love misan- thropy because without it we would have no identities, does not resolve any ques- tions, certainly. However, recognizing that humanity, in Byron’s words, is ‘‘en- amour’d of distress’’ does furnish us, as it furnished him, with the only rational starting point we have for deciding how to proceed in the face of evil that drives us to war.37 In her surrealist anatomy, The War of Dreams, Angela Carter explored this issue of misanthropy in a time of war through dramatic allusions to Kafka, De Quincey, Baudelaire, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Marquis de Sade, Bram Stoker, Ar- thurRimbaud,Alfred Jarry, the Comte de Lautre ́amont, FriedrichNietzsche,Mar- cel Proust, Sigmund Freud, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others. The penulti- mate chapter in her rendering of this issue, which she portrays as deeply implicated in but irreducible to the workings of misogyny, takes on the case of Swift.38 In place of the classical motto be tting her well-known story ‘‘The Company of Wolves’’— homo homini lupus—we are given the image of the horse-man, or centaur. Her pro- tagonist, Desiderio, and his beloved, Albertina, come upon a tribe of centaurs and To Love to Hate 129 </page> <page sequence="12"> figure 3. Caspar David Friedrich, Two Men by the Sea at Moonrise, 1817. Oil on canvas. Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. Photo: Courtesy of Bildarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz.  nd that these creatures are ‘‘not Houyhnhnms,’’ exactly, because they do have ‘‘many words to describe conditions of deceit.’’ Nonetheless, they bring us to a Swiftian, or super-Swiftian, lesson, one that draws out the surrealism in the ancient formula that de nes humankind as the animal implume bipes latis unguibus: ‘‘If I was a man, what was a man? The bay oVered me a logical de nition: a horse in a state of ultimate, biped, maneless, tailless decadence.’’ The centaurs, then, are at once men and unmen because they are men in a state of virtual perfection, intensely religious beings whose mastery over Desiderio he cannot help but accept, whom he in factmust believe are the creation of his owndesires. ‘‘I was somehow, all unknow- ing, the instigator of this horror,’’ he thinks as they gang-rape Albertina. ‘‘While as for me,’’ he says, ‘‘they forced on me the caresses of all their females for they had no notion of humanity in spite of their extraordinarynobility of spirit. Because they were far moremagni cent than man, they did not know what a man was. They did not have a word for shame and nothing human was alien to them because they were alien to everything human.’’ Human, all too unhuman, produced ‘‘according 130 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="13"> figure 4. Caspar David Friedrich, The Monk by the Sea, c.1809. Oil on canvas. Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. Photo: Courtesy of Bildarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz. to the self-determined laws of a group of synthetically authentic phenomena,’’ veri- table masterpieces of classical aesthetics, the centaurs terrorize the distinction be- tween philanthropy and misanthropy.39 A comparison of Brueghel to Carter on this point must seem terribly or even surrealistically anachronistic. Nonetheless, it is apt, and by the logic of Brueghel’s painting no less than that of Carter’s novel. Despite the apparent simplicity of its subject, misanthropy appears in Brueghel’s painting in a temporally and spatially disorienting way. It heretically undoes itself, one might say, even as it divides the world depicted by Breughel’s design. While a shepherd in the background looks after his  ock, thus giving the presumed commonality of the species a pastoral regis- ter, the misanthrope, in a blue hooded cloak, walks away from the world, which is symbolized by a lout crouched within a globe topped with a cross. The world is in the act of cutting the misanthrope’s purse, thus presumably representing the kind of shenanigans that have determined this  gure to become what he is; as we are told by the legend at the bottom of the painting (which may have been added at To Love to Hate 131 </page> <page sequence="14"> some point after its initial composition), ‘‘Because the world is so unfaithful / That is why I go in mourning.’’40 All well and good; but as art historians have long noted, there is some cause for confusion here. For instance, if the misanthrope is truly leaving the world, why is he bringing his money with him? Does the fact that his purse is red and heart-shaped indicate a sneaking love of the very world whose unfaithfulness he supposedly abhors and  ees? One might also ask about the con- trast between the thorns (or thornlike calthrops, as they may be) in front of him, in the lower left corner of the painting, and the shepherd with his  ock at the upper right.41 If the former are a symbol of the thorny fate of Christ, so, too, is the latter a conventional image of pastoral care in the Christian sense; and in going toward the one, the misanthrope must walk away from the other. Are we then to see in this moment a suggestion of inhuman sel shness in the misanthrope’s monkish self- abnegation—a hint that his stealing away from the world is a kind of heartless theft? The fact that there is no resolution to art historians’ questions about Brueghel’s aYliations in this era of violent religious con icts is very much to the point here. And this is not even to mention the obvious paradox that in  guring a separation from the world, this image of a cloaked man is itself a conventional form; aestheti- cally speaking, Brueghel’s misanthrope is as much of a worldling as is his ‘‘world’’ itself. Very much of the world, too, is Byron’s Giaour, whose ‘‘looks are not of earth nor heaven,’’ who appalls even the monks among whom he comes to dwell, who is seen by his Muslim adversaries as an ‘‘Apostate to his own vile faith,’’ and whose tale is broken into confusing fragments. This misanthrope is revealed to be, among other things, an arachnid-man. Making literal the etymology of ‘‘remorse,’’ Byron pictures the mind of his protagonist as a scorpion ‘‘girt by  re’’ that cuts it oV from the world: Till inly search’d by thousand throes, And maddening in her ire, One sad and sole relief she knows, The sting she nourish’d for her foes, Whose venom never yet was vain, Gives but one pang, and cures all pain, And darts into her desperate brain.42 As with the agenbite of inwit that so tortures Stephen Daedalus in Ulysses, this experience limns misanthropyas being the greatest challenge to aesthetics precisely because it is the unsurpassable motivation and boundary of art. Ingmar Bergman, arguably the twentieth century’s greatest exponent ofmisan- thropy, inevitably comes to mind here. For instance, early in The Passion of Anna (1969) one character, Andreas, feels compelled to deny what another has asserted of him, that he is a hermit. The remainder of the  lm is ruthlessly designed to make a liar of him, and indeed of anyone who would claim not to be essentially solitary; 132 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="15"> near the end, Andreas tells Anna, the woman with whom he has now been living for several years, ‘‘I want my solitude back.’’ The prehistory to his misanthropy is wrought through all the events recalled or played out in the  lm—a miscarriage, an aVair, a car accident, a marital separation—and it is also given a global context. In much the same way that Bergman used TV footage of a self-immolating Bud- dhist monk and a photo of a Nazi roundup of Jews in Persona (1963), in this movie the VietnamWar is referred to when Andreas and Anna sit before a TV and watch, unwillingly fascinated, the then-famous  lm of the South Vietnamese National Po- lice Chief, Nguyen Ngoc Loan, using his pistol to execute a Viet Cong prisoner on a Saigon street. On the island where this movie takes place, meanwhile, we are told of the community’s search for a terrorist who has been murdering animals—a search that comes to focus on a hermit with a history of psychological problems, Johann Andersson, whom the locals decide to assault. Although he is innocent, he is so humiliated by the assault, in which one man pisses in his face, that he commits suicide. As if all this were not more than enough, Bergman even symbolically hu- miliates his own  lm by intercutting its dramatic footage with documentary scenes of its actors discussing their roles with a quite notable lack of eloquence. In short, misanthropy is suggested here to pervade every conceivable means of representa- tion; even less subtle than the Vietnam reference is the irony that a soulless architect, Elis, has won an important commission for a ‘‘cultural center.’’ The last shot of the  lm—which needs to be viewed in the context of the Romantic landscapes that preceded it and of Burden’s 747, which followed—has Andreas alone, fallen upon his hands and knees like an unhuman, unworshipful thing, in a place on the island that appears as a desert wasteland even though it has water and bears signs of culti- vation and inhabitation. He is not in a desert, exactly, but in a site of utter disaster. IV It resembled a movie, it was almost a movie, but it was not a movie of which one could say, Movie, movie, and be comforted. It is completely understandable, of course, that the event should have appeared in aesthetic terms so immediately, to so many, so dismayingly. Even though it was not a movie, after all, it had been  lmed; and even though real people were dying, from the  rst it was clear that the deaths were less strategic, for those responsible for them, than symbolic. Accordingly, it did not take long for someone to call the terrorists ‘‘artists,’’ and Jonathan Franzen was not wrong in doing so, exactly (though he was as deliberately tasteless as Burden’s art has often sought to be).43 Unlike Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose infamous comments appeared to suggest that he gloried in this mass murder, Franzen was simply recognizing (with the help of an allusion to Kafka’s ‘‘Hunger Artist’’) that one could not go through the experi- ence of viewing images of it without feeling compelled to think that these images To Love to Hate 133 </page> <page sequence="16"> had something to teach us about the experience of art, even if that teaching must  rst appear in the form of denial.44 Similarly, commenting on his own  rst reac- tion—‘‘Oh my God, it’s like my book!’’—the author of All That Is Solid Melts into Air has reported, ‘‘Soon afterward, on the screen and then in the street, I heard people talking, and they were doing just what I’d done: making enormousmythical constructions that would cause the whole horri c event to revolve around them. We were like needy sculptors rushing to produce instant replacements for the giant stabiles that had stood onWorld Trade Plaza. We threw up anything we could hide behind to conceal our panic, our helplessness, and our instant, boundless sense of guilt.’’45 And, of course, the dust had scarcely begun to settle before hats and t- shirts with images of the burning buildings were on sale, before books about and exhibitions of photos of the event were being planned, before impromptu shrines were being erected, and before more deliberate works in all sorts of genres, in- cluding comic books, videos, and architectural maquettes, were being developed. In a meditation on the aesthetics of trauma, Marianne Hirsch tells of getting to- gether with friends to compare and exchange snapshots of the event, and almost immediately people came to think that parts of the damaged buildings should be preserved, as a kind of art object, for posterity.46 Herbert Muschamp commented in the New York Times, ‘‘If you believe that beauty begins in terror, then it is not sacrilege to speak of the beauty of the remaining walls.’’47 Like Franzen and Berman and Muschamp and countless others across the United States and the entire world, I was trans xed by the  lms of the events of September 11. Like all these millions, I watched them again and again, unwillingly fascinated, even though, if all this had simply been a matter of reality, one viewing of the horror ought to have been more than enough. In fact, as I compulsively watched the  lm being compulsively rerun on that day, I found myself especially  xated on one of the shots: the amateur video of the plane streaking in from the left side of the frame and hitting the South Tower of the World Trade Center to the accompaniment of a woman’s blasphemous scream—later edited out by the networks—‘‘Jesus Fucking Christ!’’ And I thought of Burden’s art, and of what art still tries to teach us of misanthropy. Those who thought it awful that the events of September 11th should have reminded people of the movies, those who thought it a condemnation of our taste and irrefutable proof that we should reform our popular entertainment, were un- doubtedly as well meaning as they were entirely wrong. Like it or not, politics will be aestheticized; we cannot even begin to conceive of justice without working through art, through the subject of misanthropy, and so through what Susan Buck- Morss has described, in writing of Walter Benjamin, as the agonizing ‘‘enjoyment taken in viewing our own destruction.’’48 For all its unique and almost unbearable pathos, the denial of humanity in the widespread defensive reaction to September 11—I can’t believe my eyes. . . .This can’t be real. . . .This must be a movie—was another version of the aggression against humanity, the unhuman motivation, that we  nd 134 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="17"> in art, that unreal stuV. It is this eVect of the unhuman that accounts for the notori- ous disjunction between our desire and our ability to draw a clear distinction be- tween art and everyday life. That is why it is not human, exactly, but it is not terrible, either, that people should have felt compelled to imagine, momentarily, that all this was art rather than yet another experience of its death in life.

It is for this reason, I assume, that Burden has sometimes insisted on asserting a clear distinction between art and life, as when he said, ‘‘You know I set them apart: this is art and this is life,’’ and ‘‘people confuse what I do with me’’ (quoted in LoeZer and Tong, Performance Anthology, 349). As I trust is evident, I don’t  nd these self- characterizations of his work entirely adequate. 15. Beckett,Watt, 81, 82–83. This question of the unhuman in humanity is perhaps most amusingly raised in this novel through Beckett’s famous footnote (102) in reference to his description of one who is ‘‘a  ne girl but a bleeder’’: ‘‘Haemophilia is, like enlarg- ment [sic] of the prostate, an exclusively male disorder. But not in this work.’’ 16. In terms of his work from this period, Burden is best known for the pieces, such as Shoot, that might be broadly characterized as masochistic, but 747 is by no means the only piece that dramatized some kind of aggression toward others. For example, inTV Hijack (1972) he held a knife at the throat of a local TV host who was interviewing him so as to ‘‘demonstrate’’ a TV hijack. Of interest in relation to this point, though diVering from my approach here, is the Deleuzian analysis of two of Franz Kafka’s stories (one ofwhich is discussed below) inMargotNorris, ‘‘Sadism andMasochism in ‘In the Penal Colony’ and ‘A Hunger Artist,’ ’’ in Reading Kafka: Prague, Politics, and the Fin de Sie`cle, ed.

It may be worth mentioning that the Faustian allusion in Burden’s work is even more explicitly present in ‘‘A Hunger Artist’’; as Heinz Politzer pointed out, this tale echoes Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s work at one point (Kafka’s ‘‘Wer es nicht fu ̈hlt, dem kann man es nicht begrei ich machen’’ citing Goethe’s ‘‘Wenn ihr’s nicht fu ̈hlt, ihr werdet’s nicht erjagen’’); see Heinz Politzer, Franz Kafka: Parable and Paradox (Ithaca, 1962), 304 n. 136 Re pr e se n tat i on s </page> <page sequence="19"> 21.
