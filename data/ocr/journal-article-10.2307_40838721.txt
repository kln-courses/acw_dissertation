<plain_text><page sequence="1">86 SOUTH-EAST ASIA Lewis Hill South-East Asia is usually taken to mean Burma, Thailand, Laos, Kampuchea (Cambodia), Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines. It should be remembered that peoples of South-East Asian culture are also found in the eastern hills of India (Assam - notably Nagas, Garo, Khasi, Mizo) and Bangladesh (Kuki in Chittagong Hill Tracts) and in the southern third of China (notably Tai-speakers and Miao) . Ancient peoples from South-East Asia also colonised the Pacific and Madagascar, so that some South-East Asian artefacts (e.g. outrigger canoes, xylophones) have a very wide distribution. The area's great importance in human history has been slow to be recognised, probably because of its colonial history and great cultural diversity. Often it has been relegated to the status of an intermediate zone between the great cultures of China and India. South-East Asia is an intricate and elaborate cultural mosaic. Every nation state has a vast variety of peoples and cultures. The many languages of the area together with the numerous other European and Oriental languages used in its study make it extremely difficult to study in its entirety. In view of this complexity, it is not surprising that there is no standard refer- ence work for the material culture. It would be impossible here to give much information on the identification of objects for the whole area even were I competent to do so. I will briefly point out some of the key elements to provide a broad framework within which more detailed investig- ations can be undertaken using the annotated bibliography. The environment has been relatively stable for a very long period, so all South-East Asian cultures have been able to draw on the very diversified vegetable and animal resources of the tropical forests for food and materials. Note particularly the ready availability of the bamboos and hardwoods, resins, gums and fibres. The coastal and riverain world with its ease of transport, openness to foreign contact and fishing cultures contrasts and interacts with the jungle and upland interiors and their hunting, gathering and swidden cultures. Between water and forest an ever-growing zone of wet rice culture was established which came to support an elaborate court and state complex. Thus we find in South-East Asia a constantly recurring pattern of traditional culture: fishing and</page><page sequence="2">87 trade/wet rice/swidden (rice, other grains, vegetables) /hunting and gather- ing, as one moves inland from coast and river into the forests and hills. This pattern had been largely established over 2000 years ago in prehistoric times. In historic times a succession of cultural influences from China, India, the Middle East and Europe have increased the variety of themes within the cultural pattern. From at least the first centry A.D. Hindu- Buddhist influences became important. These were augmented by Islam from the thirteenth century. Islam became dominant on the Malayan and Sumatran coasts in the fourteenth century and in Java in the late fifteenth century. From the early sixteenth century European influence began to be felt in the Philippines, E. Indonesia and the Malacca Straits. Later, only Thailand was to escape direct European colonial rule, the rest of the area being divided between the British, Dutch, French, Spanish, Americans and Portuguese, a fact which has had marked influence on the composition and location of ethnographic collections. The Vietnamese were under Chinese suzerainty from 43 A.D. until 1010 A.D., and their culture to this day remains strongly Chinese influenced. Elsewhere Chinese influence was largely concerned with trade until large scale Chinese imnigration began in the nineteenth century. Thus, the access- ibility of the area to water-bourne trade, and its many prized goods (spices, metals, forest products, etc.) brought many new culture traits. These have been repeatedly synthesized with local cultures to give South- East Asia a cultural diversity which persists until the present. What are the characteristic features of the main cultural themes in traditional South-East Asian culture that form the basic components of the syncretisms we see today? Bearing in mind that the following are broad categories, so that some items of material culture are common to more than one category, they are: 1. Hunting and gathering Few representatives today, largely in the remote forested interiors: Malay aborigines (Orang Asli) , Penan (Borneo) Orang Kubu (Sumatra) and some small groups in Thailand and the Philippines. But also a component of most of the swidden economies. Plain bows or blowguns (blowguns with spear -head attached - Borneo Dayaks), iron axes and bush knives, bamboo knives. No textiles, little clothing (bark, plaited fibres, leaves or trade textiles), shelters, mats, range of baskets, bamboos for water and cooking, bamboo musical instruments,</page><page sequence="3">88 huge pharmacoepia. For designs see field monographs. Wide range of ingenious specialised traps, 2. Fishing Fish is an important element in South-East Asian diet everywhere. Fishing economies are usually only specialised variants within a wider culture. A very large variety of fish and shellfish is taken, with consequent wide range of specialised equipment, e.g. spears, arrows, rod and line, multi-hook lines, nets, traps - from small irrigation ditch tubular ones to massive weir complexes with houses incorporated, etc. Boats - dug-out canoes to plank boats with single and double outriggers. 3. Swidden The economy of most of the interior and hill peoples. Exceptions with terraced wet rice through otherwise similar culture patterns: Angami Nagas, some Kachin, hill peoples of Luzon. Rice is the most favoured crop, but millet, grain sorghum, Job's tears, maize, manioc as well as opium poppies, many vegetables and fruits are also locally important. Apart from the opium growers of the Golden Triangle, these peoples are largely subsistence farmers who trade forest products and labour for metals, textiles, salt and weapons. The chopping knife (dao or parang) is the characteristic tool/ weapon. Silver grips - mainland hills. Other traditional weapons: plain bow and arrows, iron-headed spears, locally blowguns or crossbows (or pellet bows for hunting). Firearms, locally-made and imported are widespread. Shields: usually wood; decoration and shape distinctive and confined to small localities. Metalworking is widespread using the piston bellows; iron smelting became rare after cheap foreign steel was available. Silver for ornament from melted coinage, especially mainland hills (necklaces, neck rings, bracelets, armlets, rings - finger, nose and ear, anklets and discs for costume). Locally some brass-working (e.g. Palaung) and bronze-working (e.g. Batak) . Pottery both locally made and imported (e.g. Chinese opium pipe bowls - N. Thailand, and large jars - N. Borneo). Baskets and bamboo containers, matting. Wide range of forms and materials - bamboos and other grasses, pandanus and other palm fronds all common. Textiles: mainly cotton, some hemp (N. Thailand). Usually warp ikat woven on backstrap looms, often with supplementary weft. Made into highly decor- ated clothing and blankets with applique, feather, beetle wings, silver</page><page sequence="4">89 discs, cowries, fur, hair, embroidery (with wool, imported silk and recently artificial fibres), beadwork, etc· Women's costume tends to be elaborate, varying with age, rank and status, and also is distinctive of community. Note also tobacco containers and smoking equipment; betel containers and equipment; opium pipes and equipment (mainly Golden Triangle). Certain areas have the fire piston (see Balfour 1907 for distribution), otherwise tinder boxes, with flint, steel and tinder. Rectangular wood and/or bamboo houses on stilts with steeply pitched roofs thatched with grass, leaf or shingles. Fronts and7or gable ends often decorated with painted or carved wood. Furnishing limited, usually woven mats, and racks for cooking equipment, weapons and clothes. Large mortars and pestles for grain. Designs - geometric and curvilinear, with stylised animals and birds, and anthropomorphic figures. Disposal of the dead varies enormously, but carved wooden grave markers (e.g. Borneo) and ancestor figures (e.g. Toraja, Sulawesi and Batak, Sumatra) turn up as primitive art in collections, as do sickness figures used in curing rituals (e.g. Melanau, Borneo; Mah-Meri and Jah- Hut Malay Peninsula: all now being produced as tourist art). Many writers see these peoples as still possessing megalith building culture developed during neolithic times, and call it 'the ancient culture1. They see this as the truly characteristic South-East Asian culture which has moulded the received cultures of India, China and the West into the syncretic state cultures with the distinctively South-East Asian forms we see today. ^ · Wet rice, state and court cultures The mass cultures of South-East Asia, based on the growing of rice by irrigation. Large peasantry, village based but drawing much of its cultural inspiration from the cities and courts. The external influences of Chinese religions and Hindu-Buddhism, later Islam and Christianity are very marked. Archaeologically , many ruined religious buildings survive, some of massive size (notably in Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Java). Evidence of ancient metalworking especially in bronze, gold and silver increasingly coming to light, not necessarily associated with cities. In the peasant culture note buffalo-drawn ploughs, small rice-knives for cutting seed heads singly, and simple machines, e.g. for pounding rice, raising water, crushing sugar cane. Everyday costume tends to be simple</page><page sequence="5">90 in mass-produced plain cloth (black, blue and white), or ikat work or batik; while ceremonial costume is more elaborate than that of swidden peoples. There is a vast range of basketry and bamboo work. Court and city culture with specialised arts and crafts is the core. In outline, note elaborately decorated large rectangular buildings, with carved wood, often gilded or polychrome for royal or ritual use. Masonry, sculpted stone, brick and tile. Pottery and porcelain (esp. Thailand and Vietnam - 'celadon' and blue and white). Literature on palm leaf, paper, bone, bamboo and wood - in Burma religious texts in gold and enamel on palm leaf. Painting on walls, wood and cloth - themes religious (e.g. Jataka stories) or from local versions of the Mahabharata, Ramayana, or local epics. Enamel and niello work, especially in betel boxes which were used for giving hospitality and showing status. Betel boxes also in gold, silver, pewter and wood. Theatre in many forms important, e.g. 'shadow puppets' of leather and wood, other puppets of wood, and elabor- ately costumed human performers. Large orchestras, with elaborately made instruments in which percussion instruments (e.g. gongs, cymbals, xylophones) predominate. In the urban culture metal working reached a very high standard. Wrought iron and steel were forged to make ρ amor work for knives (esp. keris), swords, spears and arrow heads, often in elaborate forms for ceremonial and ritual. In these weapons, and in armour and costume, the skills of the blacksmith were combined with those of the goldsmith, silver- smith, jeweller and woodcarver to produce works of art, particularly for court dress and regalia. Other well made weapons include guns and cannon, certainly from the fifteenth century onwards. The area is also famous for textiles, made with both frame and backstrap looms. Warp and weft ikat work in cotton and silk; supplementary warp and weft, often with metal threads; batik and other specialised dyeing forms all have many well-known locations. Some mention should also be made of transport. At sea, there were large plank sailing ships and galleys; on the rivers, royal barges. On the land, note ox and buffalo carts, also horses and elephants and their associated trappings. In modern times note the decorative pedi-cabs, lorries and buses. In conclusion, this has been something of a Cook's Tour. I have tried to offer some order in the diversity of South-East Asian culture by pointing to ancient themes deriving from the exploitation of the</page><page sequence="6">91 environment. It is these themes which give South-East Asia a unity by moulding the elements which have been taken up in varying degrees from the many other cultures which have influenced the area. As the modern South-East Asian nations search for their independent identities in their pasts, and move hesitatingly towards increasing unity in the future, they are increasingly adopting these ancient elements as symbols.

Thailand is becoming increasingly well covered: partly through the setting up of a number of area research institutes and government departments to deal with museums, folk crafts and activities, national culture, etc. and partly because a vast amount of ethnographic fieldwork has been undertaken since the 1950s by Thai and foreign scholars. Publishing flourishes too and the Bangkok bookstalls are well-stocked with art books. For detailed work The Journal of The Siam Society is basic. Indo-China (Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam): There is a large amount of work on the ethnography of this area in French. The greatest strength lies in the archaeology and art history of the high cultures (including Champa), but there is a wealth of material on humbler artefacts to be found in the standard ethnographies, and in journals such as Artibus Asiae, Bulletin de l'Ecole Française l'Extrême-Orient, Bulletin de la Société des Etudes indochinoises, Journal Asiatique, Objets et Mondes, Revue des Arts Asiatiques, etc. Indo-China General : GROSLIER, B.P. 1962 The Arts of Indo-China New York: Crown.

There is a large amount of first class work in Dutch going back well over a century. It is often neglected because of the language: a pity, because there are many fine field monographs and periodicals. Among the periodicals mention must be made of: Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde (van Nederlandsch-Indie) , Tijdschrift voor de Indische Taal-, Land en Volkenkunde (after 1950 Lembaga Kebudajaan Indonesia), Nederlandsch-Indie Pud en Nieuw, Verhandelingen van het (Koninklijk) Bataviaasch Genootschap van Künsten en Wetenschappen. There is now also a considerable literature in Bahasa Indonesia, not always readily available in British libraries, but which can usually be found in the Netherlands or the U.S.A.
