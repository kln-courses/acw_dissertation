<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT'S ANTINOMIES IN THE LIGHT OF MODEEN SCIENCE. READ AT SARATOGA, JULY 6, 1883, BY LESTER P. WARD. It has become fashionable to regard all controversy as mere logomachy, in which some mere word is the true " bone of conten tion." "And for the word itself we fight In bitterness of soul." This view finds strong support in the undeniable fact that the intensity of sectarian antagonism increases in proportion as the essential doctrines of sects approach each other, until, as well stated by an able writer in u Macmillan's Magazine," u if you want to see men fling away the very thought of reconciliation, and close in internecine conflict, you should look at controversial ists who do ?wt difer at all, but who have adopted different words to express the same opinion." Such views are strengthened not only by facts of every-day observation, but by such memorable events of history as the two greatest schisms in Christianity, the first arinng from the attempt to add a single letter to the Nicene shibboleth, and the second growing out of the appending of a word to the Latin creed. I&gt;ut while admitting that a large amount of human controversy is of this more or less verbal character, a deeper study of human nature cannot fail to reveal glimpses of more general causes which may even be found to underlie the apparently most base</page><page sequence="2">382 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. less disputations. Indeed, the existence of antithetical types of mind, to a large extent incapable of interpreting phenomena in the same way, has been vaguely seen in all ages and by many writers. The Platonic and Epicurean schools of Greek philoso phy body forth this conception, and, in fact, seem to have exempli fled it with almost as great clearness as any subsequent event. Be tween these schools* nearly every philosopher since that day has, in however vague a manner, seemed to take sides, so that the general cast of his mind upon the fundamental problems involved in them may be deduced from his writings. " Melius autem est naturam secare quam abstrahere," said Lord Bacon; and he adds, " Id quod Democriti schola fecit, quae magis penetravit in naturam quam reliquae." This passage, besides its value in fixing Lord Bacon's position in this regard, serves well to suggest one of the chief dis tinctions between the schools. " Secare naturam " might be taken as the first step in the Baconian method, and the one by which science is specially characterized. Ernst Haeckel, speaking from the point of view of the biologists, defines this constitutional anti thesis of the human mind as follows: " If you place all the forms of cosmological conception of various peoples and times into com parative juxtaposition, you can finally bring them all into two squarely opposing groups?a causal or mechanical, and a teleolog ical or vitalistic group." He further invents the terms " monis tic" and "dualistic" to distinguish these two conceptions, the last of which refers to the recognition of a power outside of nature acting upon it and in addition to it, while in the former nature is conceived as acting alone. This wide-spread intellectual polarity may perhaps be in part explained. All philosophy aims to account for phenomena. The human mind is so constituted that no power can prevent it from perpetually striving towards this end. All systems of thought naturally fall under two general divisions. One of these explains phenomena as the product of will and design. A rock, a tree, or an animal is explained on the same principles as a watch; it ex ists, therefore it has been made. This is the teleological explana tion. The other mode of thought claims to recognize a distinction between these two classes of objects or phenomena^ and while admitting design in the latter denies it in the former. The rock, tree, animal, are not made, but home become what they are. This</page><page sequence="3">Kant '8 Antinomies in the Light of Modern Science. 383 conception let us call the genetic mode of explanation. The teleo logical and the genetic modes of explanation are therefore the respective foundations of the two great schools of human thought which severally embrace all men. The only system which ever claimed to disavow both these bases is that of Auguste Comte, and which, in so far, must be regarded rather as a revolt against philosophy than as a system of philosophy. Under both these general divisions there have grown up numer ous more special doctrines which have, each in its turn, formed nuclei for minor systems, to which, according to the special men tal proclivities of each individual, men have given in their adhe sion. To the teleological division, for example, properly belong the doctrines of pure theology or divine free-will, of predestina^ tion, and of fatalism. To this also should in part be added that modern truly dualistic school, who hold that all phenomena are the result of unvarying laws once arbitrarily impressed upon the universe. This school, on the other hand, however, except in so far as the primal origin of these laws is concerned, may consist ently be classed in the genetic division. This last-named general class, the genetic, does not possess the number or variety of special sects found in the other, and in all their essential tenets its adherents may be regarded as practically at one. Though apparently of modern origin, the genetic school of philosophy is as old as the fully-developed mind of man. As already remarked, there have always existed the two antithetical ways of looking at the world, and no age has been without adher ents to both of these systems. But there are reasons in the nature of things why the teleological habit of thought should, down to within a quite recent period, have maintained an overwhelming supremacy over the genetic habit of thought. The only philosopher who seems to have clearly perceived the true nature of this fundamental antithesis, and to have attempted a systematic analysis of the principles upon which it rests, was Immanuel Kant, whose centennial anniversary we are here to cele brate. In his immortal " Antinomies," and the profound discus sion which follows them, he has laid the foundation in psychology where it properly belongs, for a thorough understanding of this most vital and practically important condition of human thought. His Theses and Antitheses differ only in the character of the</page><page sequence="4">384: The Journal of 'Speculative Philosophy. examples given from the primary postulates of the modern tele ologists and genetists respectively, which latter class are, strictly speaking, the modern evolutionists, and his choice of terms by which to characterize the defenders of these propositions, while they are not those which either party would now select, are per haps as little objectionable to the one as to the other of these classes of persons. He calls the one the dogmatic, and the other the empirical, view of the universe, but in his time and country the former of these terms had not yet acquired that stigma which has since been gradually fastened upon it, and meant a very different thing from that which Douglas Jerrold defined as " puppyism full-grown ;" while as to the latter, the practice of opposing empiricism to quan titative scientific determination has also principally grown up since Kant's day. Still, as if somewhat unsatisfied with this word, he sometimes employs a substitute for it, and calls this the critical or the sceptical method. In using the term dogmatic as applicable to the teleological school, Kant, doubtless, had in view the fact, so apparent to all, that it was this school that assumed to teach philosophy, being greatly in the ascendancy; and in the words empirical, critical, and sceptical, he, no doubt, recognized the tendency of a few minds at all times to revolt against the prevailing conceptions, examine their assumed principles, and subject them, to logical, mechanical, and numerical tests, and to rationalistic criticisms. For he declares that in favor of accepting the former or dogmatic view of things there exist three principal arguments: 1. That derived from practical interest, since upon it appear to rest the claims of religion and morality; 2, that derived from a specula tire interest, since by its aid the entire field of speculation can be compassed by the mind and the conditioned directly derived from the unconditioned; and 3. that derived from popularity, since he conceived that the great majority would always be found on that side. It is interesting and remarkable that so great a mind should be able to find no higher motives than these upon which to base the claims of dogmatism, which meant, and still means, the acceptance of the main body of beliefs of the age. The first is of so low an order that it would seem to be beneath the dignity of a philoso</page><page sequence="5">Kant's Antinomies in'the Light of Modem Science. 385 pher to entertain it. For what has a man's practical interest to do with philosophy, with the attainment of truth in the domain of abstract thought? The argument employed by Bishop Butler, that a particular religion should be embraced on the sole ground, if on no other, that there could be nothing to lose and might be much to gain by so doing, while in the failure to do so there was nothing to gain and might be much to lose, has been generally con demned as of a low order in appealing to practical interest where a question of abstract truth was involved. But Bishop Butler was avowedly a sectarian writer, defending his particular religion, and such low appeals were to be expected. How. then, could Kant justify an analogous argument? As a disinterested phi losopher, this would seem impossible. Yet Kant's justification, from his owTn peculiar point of view, though somewhat amusing, will appear to be quite satisfactory. It is this: Neither the thesis nor the antithesis of any of his antinomies is capable of proof, or rather both are capable of absolute demonstration; and, being contradictories, all argument becomes absurd. With him the universe is a great dilemma, of which any one may take either horn with exactly equal chances of reaching the truth. Of course, therefore, if there is any difference in this respect, he had better choose the one which is most to his interest, and this, Kant thought, was unquestionably the dogmatic. Fully as much might be said of his third reason for preferring that side, viz.: the advantage to be derived from its greater popu larity. If possible, this claim possesses a still lower moral weight than that of practical interest, of wdiich it is, indeed, merely a temporal form. Only politicians now urge it as a means of influ encing men's opinions. It certainly could never be decently urged except in just such a case as Kant conceived this to be; a case in which it would, otherwise, be absolutely immaterial which side one took. The truth itself was hopelessly unattainable, and, it any ulterior consequences were, as a matter of fact, to follow either decision, one was as likely to escape them by the one course as by the other. The only guide left, therefore, wras simply pres ent advantage; and, be that the least greater on the one than on the other side, this should be sufficient to determine the decision. Kant's second ground for accepting the thesis rather than the antithesis of his antinomies?i. en the dogmatic rather than the : s * XV?25</page><page sequence="6">386 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. empirical or sceptical view of the universe, viz.: that of specula tive interest?being highly philosophical, deserves more attention. And, logically enough, we find him enumerating among the ad vantages which the mind is to derive from this course that of ease or convenience (Gemachlichkeit). Nothing is truer than that tele ology is a relief to the overstrained intellect striving to build a universe between two infinities. It is the philosophy of the in dolent brain, the ignava ratio, and is thus adapted both to the childhood of the world and to all those who weary of intellectual effort. These may be good reasons where all hope of arriving at objective truth is renounced; they could scarcely be admitted under any other circumstances. That there is any greater intrin sic dignity or nobility in a universe created by design than in one created by evolution, few men with scientific habits of thought will probably be able to admit. These qualities are not objective, but subjective. They do not belong to the world, but to those who contemplate it, and thus so much of the supposed speculative interest is carried back to the class of practical interest. The empiricist of Kant loses all these advantages. In embrac ing the antitheses he removes the foundations of religion and of morality, the latter conceived as deriving all its sanction from authority. "If there is no Primordial Being (Urwesen) distinct from the universe, if the universe is without a beginning, and, therefore, without a creator, our will not free, and the soul of the same divisibility and perishability as matter, moral ideas and prin ciples lose all validity, and fall with the transcendental ideas which formed their theoretical support." In this passage Kant evi dently fails to distinguish the fine shades on the strength of which many modern scientists so stoutly reject the charge of material ism. Yet he has clearly in view the stern mechanical connec tion between phenomena which constitutes the basis of the causa tional philosophy of science. Empiricism, as thus defined, is not, however, entirely without its advantages. It, too, possesses a certain speculative interest, in defining which the great philosopher still more clearly shows that he had in mind that same universal antithesis in the constitution of the human mind which we sought to describe at the outset. " Empiricism," he says, " affords advantages to the speculative interest of the reason which are very fascinating, and far exceed</page><page sequence="7">Kantfs Antinomies in the Light of Modern ScieTice. 387 those which the dogmatic teacher of rational ideas can promise. In the former the intellect is always on its own peculiar ground, viz.: the field of mere possible experiences, whose laws it can trace back, and by means of which it can expand its own certain and comprehensible knowledge without end. . . . The empiricist will never allow any epoch of nature to be assumed as the ab solutely first, or any limit of his outlook into the surrounding world to be regarded as the outermost, or any of the objects of nature, which he can resolve by mathematics or by observation and bring synthetically under his contemplation (Anschauung)? the extended?to pass over to those which neither sense nor imagi nation can ever represent in concreto?the simple?." Surely, his u empiricist" is here none other than a modern genetist, evolu tionist, or scientist. Even admitting all that Kant maintains for and against the two opposing views, it may still be a question whether the manly in -dependence of the empiricist would not be preferable to the idle respectability of the dogmatist. Still better to illustrate these two antagonistic phases of thought, Kant asserts that they embody the contrast between Platonism and Epicureanism. Whether the teleologists can fairly regard Plato as the founder or first great representative of their views in philosophy may, it is true, be open to some question; but that Epicurus foreshadowed, as faithfully as could be expected from the state of knowledge in his time, the teachings of modern sci ence and the principles of the genetic causational or evolutionary school, cannot be candidly denied. And, if his sect did nothing else, they clearly proved that this apparent question of opinion really has a psychological basis, and exists deep in the constitution of the human mind, more or less independently of the condition of human knowledge in the world. There always have existed a few minds unwilling to accept the dogmatism of the mass. There always crops out in society a more or less pronounced manifesta tion of rationalism as opposed to authority. While this class of views finds few open advocates, it always finds many tacit adher ents, and, when uttered, a large, though usually irresponsible, fol lowing. Criticism of received beliefs is always sweet to a con siderable number who rejoice at the overthrow of the leaders of opinion or the fall of paragons of morality. And this it is which</page><page sequence="8">388 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. often renders the peace of society insecure. The established code of morals is dimly felt by the lower classes to be in some respects radically unsound. The broad contrast between men's nominal beliefs as spoken and their real beliefs as acted is apparent even to children. The standard of conduct is so much higher than that which the controllers of conduct can themselves live up to, resulting always in the punishment of the weak and the poor for the same transgressions as are daily committed with impunity by the rich and the powerful, that the lowest miscreant sees that there is some fundamental wrong underlying the entire social fabric, although he can not tell what it is. All this must be regarded as the legitimate consequence of the undue supremacy of dogmatic ideas and teleological conceptions in society. So far from favoring morality, they are the direct cause of the most dangerous form of immorality, viz.: a mutinous revolt against too severe and unnatural moral restraints. Rules of conduct based on these conceptions are necessarily arbitrary, while the normal intellect naturally demands a reason for its obedience. While these truths are equally applicable to all classes of con duct, we will illustrate them here only in one. That the prevail ing sentiment of society on the question of the purity of actions which spring from love is in large measure false, and in so far injurious, is evident from many indications. The steady refusal of the popular pulse to beat in unison with moral precept respect ing it may be counted among the most significant of these in dices. In fact, it is very curious, and suggests the demoralizing tendency of too high moral standards, to observe to how great an extent the moral code is upheld in word and violated in action. Many persons, when questions of this class arise for discussion, will defend the side of dogmatism who at the same time are really in sympathy with the side of scepticism. The real popu larity of this side, when it finds an opportunity to express itself through channels that are deemed respectable, and where its real nature h likely to remain concealed, is well shown by the manner in which works of fiction are demanded and the stage is supported.. These agencies are the natural defenders of the critical side of this question, which constitutes almost their only mission and rat son (Vcfre. They usually aim to demonstrate the essential</page><page sequence="9">Kanth Antinomies in the Light of Modem Science. 389 purity of such acts, dictated by the sexual emotions, as me ethical canons declare impure. A romance or a drama which should fail to administer some such rebuke to the accepted tenets of orthodox morality would be adjudged tame, and would prove a financial failure. Every one knows with what avidity this class of critical literature is devoured by the public and its dramatic representa tion is applauded. In fact, as already remarked, there exists throughout society, and probably always has existed, not only with respect to this class of acts, but with respect to many others, a deep-seated rebellion against much that claims to call itself tear i&amp;xr)v, moral or right?as it were, a vague consciousness, which the average intellect cannot formulate, of the arbitrary and factitious character of the moral and social codes, through the shadowy form of which may be dimly seen the half-unconscious recognition that human action is the product of fixed mechanical laws, that there is no absolute good or bad, but that these quali ties are relative to the benefit or injury done to beings susceptible to pleasure and pain, and that the arbitrary rules of society based on the negation of these truths fall far short of their extravagant claims in regulating the conduct of men. But returning to the antinomies themselves, and considering the problems presented by the thesis and the antithesis of each in the light of what is now known, and by the aid of modern methods of investigation, we shall see that it is not true that both sides admit of equal proofs and disproofs. Disregarding Kant's logical demonstrations as worthless at his own showing, since they reduce the argument on either side to an absurdity, and appealing to the inductive method, which, without claiming infallibility, has wrought such mighty results for man, we may with safety main tain that the side of these questions which Kant calls the empiri cal has gained upon that which he calls the dogmatic in about the same proportion as the knowledge of the nature of things has increased in the world. The spirit of opposition to teleological conceptions could make no headway as long as so little was known of natural processes. Lucretius might write De Rerum Natura, but what he could say that was true must go unsupported by facts and be discredited, while much that he must say that was false would be disproved and throw still greater discredit upon his system. In a state of profound ignorance of the universe, teleo</page><page sequence="10">390 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. logical explanations were the only ones the world would accept. They could be understood; genetic explanations could not. Ap pearances were all on one side. The deeper truths could not be comprehended. The greatest paradox which nature presents is that of adaptation. The word itself contains an ambiguity. It possesses both an active and a middle or reflective sense. The former is teleological, the latter genetic. Adaptation in a purely passive sense is admitted by all. No one denies *that there exists a great amount of correspondence between apparently very dis tinct objects. It is evident that they have in some way been made to correspond. The vital*question is: How and by what power have they been so made ? The teleologist says: By a power from without; by design. The genetist says : By a power from within ; by adaptation. Just here is the grand schism. It is easy to see, too, why the teleologists should at first and for a long time enjoy a supremacy. The teleological answer to any question requires comparatively littlet intellectual effort. It is the easiest way of explaining things, the first explanation that sug gests itself. Not only is it intrinsically more simple, but it is, more in accord with human experience and the natural habit of thought. In other words, it is anthropomorphic. It is most natu ral to explain natural phenomena in the same way that artificial phenomena are explained. A garment is adapted to the body that i3 to wear it. A duck's foot is adapted to the water it swims in. The explanation of the first of these facts is known ; that of the second is unknown. Why not infer it from that of the first ? There exists no other known explanation. To sit down and evolve one of an entirely different kind is not only a laborious task, but, when announced, it must remain unproved until a vast amount of scientific investigation shall have established a broad basis of induction. The sceptic, therefore, who in the infancy of human thought had the temerity to suggest that things may have worked out their observed relations of correspondence through the inherent activities residing within themselves, was met, natu rally enough, with derision. Yet every step that science ha&amp; taken has been in the direction of disproving the popular and confirming the unpopular view. It has been gradually but stead ily vindicating reason as against analogy, and establishing a causal as against an arbitrary connection between related facts.</page><page sequence="11">Kantfs Antinomies in the Light of Modern Science. 391 To sustain this statement, let us consider the piiueipai antino mies somewhat more closely. For this purpose the first and third may be selected. As regards the ?econd, it seems scarcely appli cable to this discussion. If there is any difference between its two propositions, in this respect, the one Kant calls the antithesis would seem to be the more dogmatic. So far as the facts of science are concerned, they tend to sustain the view that matter is a reality, and as such must possess a real ultimate unit?the atom ?not, indeed, of chemistry, but of a transcendental chemistry, which is the domain of reason, as it reaches down below the sen sible world of phenomena. Those are usually regarded as the dogmatists on this question who, like Boscovitch, and, we might add, Herbert Spencer, seek to resolve matter into "centres of force," and other ontological conceptions. Let us examine, then, Kant's first antinomy: " The universe has a beginning in time, and is also enclosed within limits in space;" the antithesis of which is : " The universe has no begin ning, and no limits in space, but is eternal in time and infinite in space." Has science anything to say on this question, and, if so, which side does it espouse ? Undoubtedly science has to do with it, and it also clearly takes sides upon it. Quantitative chemistry, scarcely born in Kant's time, has practically demonstrated the infinite duration of the universe in establishing the indestructi bility of matter. Astronomy, to which Kant's own immortal " Theorie des Himmels " helped to give its rational impetus, has now so expanded the conception of space that it has become habitual to regard the universe.as absolutely without limits. If any one doubts this, let him make an effort to go back to the old dogmatic conception, and figure to his mind a beginning or end to its duration, or boundaries to its extent. He will find this im possible, and this impossibility is wholly due to the increased knowledge of the universe which science has given to the world. It was once possible, it is still possible to the ignorant, to set bounds to time and space, but inductive science has swept away such crude scaffoldings and opened up to the human mind a view of the infinite. It is no longer a transcendental question. It is a scientific one, to be solved, like all other scientific questions, by the accu mulation of facts. Nothing in concrete science is demonstrated</page><page sequence="12">392 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. a priori. The practical truths of the universe are established a posteriori, by massing the evidence. In many of the questions now regarded as settled the evidence has long been conflicting, and much still remains in some to be removed. Yet these re sidual facts are admitted by all to be overborne by the weight of evidence opposed to them. Such is the character of the greater part of the scientific truth of the world. But the questions in volved in Kant's antinomies differ from ordinary scientific prob lems in two respects. On the one hand, infinity must be proved, which demands, of course, better evidence; but, on the other hand, there are no facts opposed to infinity, but all the evidence is on one side. Not one circumstance can be named which points to a beginning or end of either time or"space, while every fact and every law that human observation and reflection have brought forth point to .the boundlessness of both in all directions. Only ignorance of these facts, and failure to exercise the rational faculty, can prevent the mind from conceding this truth. The third antinomy has the following for its thesis: " Causality, according to the laws of nature, is not the only causality from wdiich the phenomena of the universe may be derived. It is still necessary to assume a causality through freedom for the explana tion of these phenomena." The antithesis is: "There is no free dom, but everything in the universe takes place according to the laws of nature." The great issue is here squarely7 stated, and here it is that accumulating knowledge of the nature of things is working steadily and uniformly against the dogmatic, and in favor of the empirical side. Absolutely no facts are being discovered in favor of freedom, while everything is ranging itself on the side of uni versal law. From one department of knowledge after another, and in inverse proportion to the complexity of the phenomena, and hence in direct ratio to the ease with which they are com prehended, science is eliminating all the facts which require the hypothesis of freedom for their explanation. From astronomy, from geology, from physics and chemistry, these eons have been successively expelled ; they are now being driven from their fortifications in biology to their citadel in psychology. Even here they are vigorously attacked by the school of Bain and Spencer on the one hand, and that of Flourens and Ferrier on</page><page sequence="13">Kantfs Antinomies in the Light of Modern Science. 393 the other. The very freedom of the human will is shown to be a delusion, and the interval between morals and physics is spanned by the heartless clinics of Maudsley. We need not go further and state the fourth and last of Kant's antinomies relating to the existence or non-existence of a " Neces sary Being." The first and third Antitheses, established, consti tute the premises for the establishment of the fourth. Eternal matter, with its equally eternal activities, suffices to account for all the phenomena of the universe, which are as infinite in causation as in duration or extent. Again, all departments of science con firm this truth. When Laplace was asked how he could have written so great a work as the Mecaniqne Celeste on the sub ject of the system of the universe, without once mentioning its Author, he replied : " Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothese la." All the more complex sciences are, one by one, and in the inverse order of their complexity, also dispensing with this hypothesis. Like many other once useful hypotheses, that of theo-teleology', which, as already remarked, was suggested from analogy with the fact of anthropo-teleology, has ceased to be useful, and where still adhered to becomes a burden to the progress of truth. In astron omy the nebular hypothesis which Kant founded, and Laplace demonstrated, has completely superseded it. In chemistry and physics, the atomic theory, formulated as a philosophy by Democ ritus, and established as a science by Dalton, renders it redundant. In biology the law ef adaptation, clearly stated by Lamarck, and that of selection, cumulatively demonstrated by Darwin, and the inter operation of these and that of heredity, thoroughly set forth by Spencer and Haeckel, have freed this field from teleological trammels almost as completely as those of the less complex sciences have been freed from them. And thus is science march ing relentlessly forward, and reclaiming one field after another that had been so long given over to dogmatic conceptions, until there is now scarcely room to doubt that its conquest must ulti mately become complete. But what is this that has thus been accomplished ? It is nothing less than the establishment of the Antithesis or empirical proposi tion of Kant's antinomies. They have been removed from the domain of transcendental philosophy, subjected to scientific methods, such as are applied to all other truths, and proved, as</page><page sequence="14">394 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. other propositions are proved, by the accumulation of legitimate facts. The eternity of matter and motion and the infinity of space have passed into scientific postulates, and the uninterrupted and unlimited causal dependence of all phenomena in their rela tion of antecedents and consequents is the fundamental axiom from which all scientific investigation now proceeds. Though these truths may seem clear to us to-day, though we may have become so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of modern scientific thought that they are little more to us than truisms, we must not forget that the mental atmosphere we now breathe has been purified during the past century, and that what we are, as it were, born in possession of, Kant could only gain by the pro foundest meditation. And, when we further contemplate that great mind as constitutionally of a teleological or dogmatic cast, we may realize the immense power it must have possessed to pene trate the mists of both the objective and subjective darkness in which he lived, and formulate, even for his opponents, the argu ments by which they were to win their victories. It is the mis fortune of the teleological school of to-day that they are incom -petent to contend with the genetic school on the same plane of activity. The latter find no difficulty in transferring their base of operations from a scientific to a dogmatic field, and giving bat tle on the enemy's own grounds. This is doubtless because they are, for the most part, themselves converts from dogmatism, which still constitutes the bulk of most men's early education, and they know how temporarily to return to their old, familiar haunts^ but those who have never crossed this boundary are either unable or unwilling to look over and see what is beyond. In their attacks upon science, therefore, they confine themselves chiefly to the free use of epithets which have a stigma only for dogmatists, and can not, of course, fail to display such a profound lack of acquaint ance, not with science alone, but with the very ways in which science carries conviction to the mind, that the effect upon the only ones they would influence is usually little more than amusing. The concluding thought of this paper is therefore to hold up the great thinker, whose hundredth anniversary we are here to commemorate, as an example to be followed, so far as that is pos sible, by all those who feel that the empirical, the critical, the</page><page sequence="15">God as the Eternally Begotten Son. 395 sceptical method is advancing too rapidly, and who would impose upon it a wholesome restraint. For, just as in the field of battle a thorough knowledge of the enemy's position, force, and move ments is of the highest possible vajue, so in the field of philoso phy, in its broad, practical developments, the secret of successful logic lies in the power to impress the contestant with a complete mastery of his side of the controversy as well as one's own. This power, of all logicians, Kant most pre-eminently revealed, even pointing out to his opponents elements of strength and grounds of justification which they in their blind zeal had only intuitively perceived, if at all. And there can be no doubt that science and rational philosophy would not only welcome a contest of this enlightened kind, but would seek to profit by it, as they profit by every means of advancing the cause of truth in the world.</page></plain_text>
