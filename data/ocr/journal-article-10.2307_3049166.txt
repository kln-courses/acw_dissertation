<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Praying Mantis in Surrealist Art* William L. Pressly The praying mantis became a central iconographic pre- occupation for the Surrealists and their circle primarily as a result of its extraordinary mating ritual in which the female devours the male during or after coitus (Fig. i).1 Influenced by the writings of Freud and fascinated by his concept of man's repressed sexuality, the Surrealists found this insect's cannibalistic nuptial a compelling image of the potential for erotic violence lurking in the darker recesses of the human mind. Although other insects perform identical sexual rites,2 the particular interest in the mantis was largely due to its exceptionally anthropomorphic form and to the imagina- tive observations of J. H. Fabre, who documented this insect's habits with as much poetry as science.3 Not sur- prisingly, it is the praying mantis which appears as the most prominent creature in Kurt Seligmann's encyclopedic bestiary, Les animaux surrialistes.4 The mantis was the subject of an article by Roger Caillois in 1934 in an early issue of Minotaure,5 a Surrealist publica- tion which often mirrored the current interests of the movement. Caillois claimed for the mantis a prestigious ancestry, surmising that it was probably the first insect to have appeared on earth. He described the prolific meanings associated with this creature in the folklore and myths of diverse cultures in which it plays both a divine and diabol- ical role.6 Caillois's essay, borrowing eclectically from anthropological, biological and psychoanalytic findings, concluded that man's fascination with the mantis was based on a reaction to its humanoid form and a psychological response to its primordially violent coitus. He also mentioned the fascination of his artistic contemporaries with the mantis. Andre Breton and Paul Eluard were described as raising the insect, and Caillois quoted verse by Breton in which he employed his firsthand knowledge of its violence.7 Caillois's discussion of contemporaries who were inspired as well as intrigued by the mantis climaxed with Salvador Dali. He pointed to the artist's association of this macabre creature with the most frightening aspects of sex and eating - a reflec- tion of his fear of castration by the vagina dentata.8 Dali was treated to a live performance of the mantis's cannibalistic marriage rites at the home of Eluard,9 and there are numerous references to this insect throughout his writings. He made extensive use of the mantis's sexual habits in his description of Millet's Angelus, a painting which had impressed him as a child but which struck him with a new visionary intensity as an adult.10 Despite its tranquil rendering of a pious peasant couple, the Angelus for Dali was rife with obsessive images of sexual repression. In his fantasies the woman adopted the expectant, exhibitionistic, "spectral" attitude of the female mantis in the deadly calm preceding the devouring assault.11 He identified this men- acing figure with his mother, casting himself in the role of the male insect. In his "analysis" of Millet's painting, Dali was stimulated by Fabre's descriptions of the mantis as a satanic predator disguised as a pious supplicant, and he believed that Fabre also associated the elegiac and "atavistic" mood of twilight with the ancient world of the first insects.12 He cited the scientist's contention that as one of the oldest of land * This article began as a paper for a seminar on Dada and Surrealist art given by William S. Rubin in the fall of 1969 at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. I would like to express my deep appreci- ation to Professor Rubin for his invaluable suggestions and careful read- ing of the manuscript. I would also like to thank Professor Robert Rosenblum for his considerable contributions and especially for his enthusiasm, without which this article might never have appeared. 1 Ironically, however, the mantis is not as lethal as its early admirers assumed, since more recent research indicates that this savage act occurs with any frequency only when the insect is in captivity. 2 Examples are the female of the golden scarabaeus, the scorpion of Languedoc, and certain spiders. In this connection one might mention the vampirish tarantula that threatened Lautrdamont and Marcel Duchamp's nightmare in which a female beetle, a Kafkaesque meta- morphosis of the Bride, tormented him.

Caillois, "La mante religieuse," Minotaure, 5, 1934, 23-6. 6 The mantis, whose name is derived from the Greek for prophet or seer, has even on occasion been elevated to the role of a deity with benign powers of nourishment and resurrection. See L. van der Post, The Heart of the Hunter, London, 1968, for a lengthy discussion of the mantis as the great hero of creation for the African Bushman. In Provence as well as southern Africa it has been associated with teeth, thereby linking it with sexuality and nutrition.In addition, the name of a type of mantis known as the empusa also can evoke the image of a spectre or lamir. See Caillois, "La mante religieuse," 23f. 7 "Celles qui dans l'amour entendent le vent passer sur [misquoted by Caillois as "dans"] les peupliers/Celles qui dans la haine sont plus 6lancees que les mantes religieuses" (Caillois, "La mante religieuse," 25, n. 18, quoted from "Je m'6coute encore parler" in Ralentir travaux, Paris, 1930, by A. Breton, R. Char and P. Eluard). 8 The fear of the vagina dentata was by no means a concern exclusive to Dali, as is demonstrated by Matta's cover for VVV, 4, Feb. 1944, and by Picasso's toothed vulva-shaped mouths which are discussed in R. Rosen- blum, "Picasso and the Anatomy of Eroticism," Studies in Erotic Art, ed. T. Bowie and C. V. Christenson, New York, 1970, 34of. 9 W. S. Rubin, Dada and Surrealist Art, New York, 1969, 220. 10 Dali stated, "But suddenly in 1929, upon seeing a reproduction of the Angelus again, I was violently seized by the same uneasiness and the original emotional upset" (S. Dali, The Secret Life of Salvador Dali, trans. H. M. Chevalier, New York, 1942, 64, n. I). In a work written before World War II, he listed June, 1932, as the moment of vision when, without any external stimuli, the painting appeared in all its troubling enigma (S. Dali, Le mythe tragique de l'Angilus de Millet, Paris, 1963, 17). The Angelus, however, first appeared in his art around 1929 in the paint- ing Imperial Monument to the Child- Woman.

In his novel Hidden Faces two of the protagonists, Veronica and Baba, appear as praying mantes in the role of the frustrated mythic pair Tristan and Isolde, devouring one another until they are reconciled in the d6nouement.15 Despite the mantis's frequent appearance in Dali's writings, one looks in vain for this insect in the paintings of his Surrealist period - that is, until one realizes that the artist identified it with the image of the grasshopper or locust, which often recurs in the work of that time.16 Thus, even though the meaning of the grasshopper is firmly rooted in Dali's personal experience, it is also heavily dependent for its poetic and iconographic associations on the artist's fascination with its lethal cousin. According to Dali's childhood memories, the grasshopper was at first an object of delight, reflecting the colorful tints of his native twilight skies.17 But this initial pleasure later turned to an even stronger disgust, and the insect came to represent his inhibiting father: "My father also thwarted me in many of my desires. He was a notary with strict and old-fashioned ideas who did not desire his son to become an artist. I grew up to dislike him and in my mind I substituted a grasshopper for his image."18 The association of this insect with his father was a manifestation of Dali's fear of being eaten by this authori- tarian figure. The artist frequently alluded to this fear in his references to the myth of Saturn devouring his children, the Biblical episodes of Abraham sacrificing Isaac and God the Father sacrificing Christ, and in his personal interpretation of the legend of William Tell, in which the Swiss hero is a cannibalistic father motivated by an incestuous wish to mutilate his son. In Dali's Accommodations of Desire19 the filial sacrifice is directly depicted without any literary allusions. The grasshopper-mantis is thus an image unique in its ability to convey the castrating desire that the artist attributed to both his parents. In a typical use of the third person in discussing himself, he expressed his distress in the lament, "Grasshopper - loathsome insect! Horror, night- mare, martyrizer and hallucinating folly of Salvador Dali's life.'"20 The grasshopper's role in Dali's art and writings, how- ever, is more complex than that of an emasculating monster. As a terrifying crystallization of a savage desire to devour, it is also a reminder of the fear of being eaten. In this associ- ative reversal the martyrizer becomes the martyr. Just as the mantis can represent the male victim, the locust can also be considered as a refined culinary delicacy. Dali even treated the female mantis as a composite of edible morsels in comparing its anatomy to that of sexually appealing women whose detachable parts were meant to be eaten.21 In an article on Art Nouveau,22 he described the organic forms common to this style as an erotic fantasy made tangible so that the amorous imagination might devour the object of desire. He associated illustrations of Guimard's ornament for the entrances to the Paris Metro (Figs. 2-5) with the "atavistic" quality of Millet's Angelus, and invited the reader to eat them.23 Brassai photographed these orna- ments for the article in such a way that it takes only a little assistance from Dali's "paranoiac-critical method"24 to realize that they look more like mantes than lyric architec- tural design. The grasshopper-mantis first appears in Dali's paintings of 1929, and its most monumental treatment occurs in The Great Masturbator (Fig. 6) of the same year, in which the insect characteristically appears clinging to the underside of a reposing head. As William Rubin has pointed out, this sleeping or entranced embryonic head is a self-portrait.25 The artist described its color as being "livid as wax,"26 a substance that for him had a macabre evocation of death.27 He also described the face as terminating in Art Nouveau ornament,28 Art Nouveau being his favorite example of a "nutritive" artistic period. A string dangles from one of the grasshopper's legs, reminiscent of a passage in the artist's autobiography in which the insect is a victim: "Those horrible grasshoppers of Figueras, half-crushed on the edges of the sidewalks, dragging a long foul string tied to their legs 13 Ibid., 77f. 14 Ibid., 77. 15 S. Dali, Hidden Faces, trans. H. M. Chevalier, New York, 1944, 152. Dali earlier described Tristan and Isolde as "the prototypes of one of those tragedies of unconsummated love which in the realm of the sentiments are as ferociously cannibalistic as that of the praying mantis actually devouring its male on their wedding day, during the very act of love" (Dali, Secret Life, 144). Appropriately, the frustrated lovers of Dali and Buiiuel's movie L'Age d'or play out this drama to music from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde. 16 Rubin, Dada and Surrealist Art, 220.

H. Fabre's characteriza- tion of the mantis's attitude in front of its prey as that of a spectre may have influenced Dali's use of the term (J. H. Fabre, Souvenirs entomo- logiques, Paris, 1922, v, 317). The mantis is also called "spectre" in popular nomenclature. See Caillois, "La mante religieuse," 23. 22 S.

In a poem written in September of the year following the completion of The Great Masturbator, Dali described the anguish inflicted on the self-portrait head by the locust or grasshopper: Encounter in this still too bright evening hour While the membrane which covers his mouth completely Toughens under the agony of the enormous locust Which had been gripped and glued to it For five days and five nights.30 Because of Dali's obsession with gastronomic sex, it is not surprising that the grasshopper's assault should be directed at the mouth, an erogenous zone which could suggest either a toothed, castrating vagina or the place of intake for come- stible, erotic pleasures. Covered by a toughening membrane, the Daliesque head of The Great Masturbator is unable either to defend itself or to enjoy. The ants which swarm over the grasshopper's belly are a symbol of putrescence,31 but they also suggest feminine pubic hair, an association reinforced by another painting of 1929, Portrait of Paul Eluard (Fig. 7), in which a finger is thrust into a hole in alocust at this same spot. The grasshopper- mantis's dual nature is reaffirmed by its possession of this feminine underside on its stiff phallic shape. As the title The Great Masturbator suggests, this painting is a monument to onanism, a private act that for Dali offered an alternative to potentially castrating coitus. The idealized figure of Gala, Dali's future wife, veined and comestible like the architectural ornament below, appears intoxicated by her proximity to the male genitals. In this masturbatory dream her mouth offers the genitals a voluptuous caress, an action that is the reverse of the emasculating grasshopper's attack on the sealed mouth. The finely razored cuts on the male's legs recall the artist's self-mutilating preparations for his first serious meeting with Gala at a time when masturbation was still his only orgiastic release.32 For Dali the sugared almond of the Playa Confitera balancing on the tip of the skull "tantalizes onanism,"33 and the head of the father-lion evidences a mocking potency with its flushed, erect tongue and sharp fangs. At the bottom left a figure turns away in shame, while, cradled in its shadow, there seem to appear the minute forms of a father and son on the distant horizon. In the center foreground a featureless male is frustrated in his embrace with an inert female, the straight line of their shadow eloquently testifying to their separation. In the Portrait of Paul Eluard a second grasshopper appears squashed beneath the hand on the poet's expansive fore- head, recalling this episode from Dali's childhood: "On one occasion my girl cousin purposely crushed a large grasshopper on my neck. I felt the same unnamable and slobbery sliminess that I had noticed in the fish; and though it was eviscerated and abundantly sticky with a loathsome fluid, it still stirred, half destroyed, between my shirt-collar and my flesh, and its jagged legs clutched my neck with such force that I felt they would be torn off sooner than relax their death-grip."34 The grasshopper, in that it is manipulated by the girl cousin, is again part of a feminine assault. Although the locust is a victim as well as an assail- ant, its slimy fluid and gripping legs reinforce this image of sexual aggression. In the painting a butterfly is pinned under the hand with the grasshopper, perhaps suggesting that something beautiful will emerge from this loathsome experience. The slimy fish mentioned in the above passage is the "slobberer," and it was the youthful Dali's discovery of the resemblance between this fish's repulsive face and that of the grasshopper which initiated his horrified disgust for the insect. In the painting of Eluard the prominent locust is positioned within the Daliesque head which now ends in the nostril and toothed mouth of a red fish. That the eye of the grasshopper and the eye of the fish are identical can be seen in a comparison with the fish in The First Days of Spring,35 painted in the same year. This marine image also helps to explain the protruding fishhook in The Great Masturbator. While the fish can display a threatening aspect, it can, like the locust, be seen as an object to be eaten, especially as Dali related it to the Eucharist.36 He identified himself with the Savior, the sacrificed son whose name was identical to his own, and in Profanation of the Host37 of I929, four heads equipped with clinging grasshoppers descend in Art Nouveau waves, while another Dalian head, bearded like Christ, is confronted at the point of the sealed mouth by the Host and the wine, the devouring and the devoured symbols of the Eucharist. In The Font38 of the next year, the Eucharist is flanked by the threatening grasshopper and a menacing woman-receptacle who represents the artist's mother.39 In The First Days of Spring it is the Dalian head which is positioned between the locust and the attacking 29 Ibid., 130. 30 R. Descharnes, The World of Salvador Dali, New York, 1962, 63, trans. from Dali's Lafemme visible, Paris, 1930, 39. In a later comment the artist again emphasized the pain involved in the juxtaposition of the grass- hopper with the non-existent mouth: "All the horror of this painting, for me, resides in the fact that the face has no mouth. In the place of the mouth there is the terrifying locust" (Descharnes, World of Dali, 62). 31 Dali, Secret Life, 249. 32 Ibid., 228. 33 Descharnes, World of Dali, 62. 34 Dali, Secret Life, 129. 35 Reproduced in Gerard, Dali, pl. 82. 36 Fish form an integral part of the painting Eucharistic Still Life of 1952, reproduced in Gerard, Dali, pl. 214.

The grasshopper-mantis is one of the central figures of Dali's solipsistic cosmos, a creation of his childhood recollec- tions, both real and imaginary, filtered through his esoteric readings. It is interesting, however, that although it ap- peared in numerous canvases from 1929 to 1931, its duration as an active component of Dali's iconography was extra- ordinarily brief. It was confined exclusively to the artist's most creative period, during the time of his initial, stimulat- ing contacts with the Surrealists, and it seems to have vanished from his visual repertoire after 1931.40 The grasshopper-mantis performed varying roles, but it was primarily as an image of the castrating devourer, with its phallic shape and feminine underside, that it harrassed the impotent Dalian heads of the paintings. Perched on the skinned-over mouth, it threatened to devour it rather than to be devoured. As one might surmise, it was Gala who exorcised much of its demonic potential,41 for after its obsessive visual appearances had ceased the praying mantis could also represent the possibility of a total union with the object of desire rather than just an image of fear and frustration. In contrast to Dali's compulsively detailed treatment of the insect, Picasso suggestively adapted the most character- istic features of the praying mantis in two important canvases, Seated Bather (Fig. 8) and the Crucifixion,42 which date from the beginning of 1930. While the ponderous skeletal forms of the bather wittily adopt a relaxed casual pose, the vicious mantis head leaves no doubt of this female monster's menacing nature. Her vertical saw-toothed jaws, a reminder of the vagina dentata, are not unlike the mandibles of the mantis.43 They also evoke the spiked arms located just beneath the insect's triangular head.44 Seated on an isolated beach like some primordial mutation, her monumentalized trap-like features appear as an archetypal expression of a barbaric and destructive love. This same head appears on a figure which may be the Magdalen in the Crucifixion, an allusion, perhaps, to the rampant sexuality of this repentant man-trap.45 In the late twenties Picasso painted many pictures of subhuman, ferocious women which, in part, may have been a response to his dis- integrating relationship with his wife Olga, but few express so powerfully as do these two images the cold predatory side of the female nature. For here the alluring charms of the destructive siren have been reduced to a biological reflex.46 Of the Surrealists, Andre Masson was the artist who most consistently exploited the image of the praying mantis. His fascination with the mantis and the turbulent cosmos of the insect world in many ways carried forward iconographi- cally his earlier preoccupation with violence. Masson's participation in World War I yielded intense memories of a brutal, although strangely poetic holocaust, and his numerous paintings of animal combats testify to his meta- phoric exploration of the world of cataclysmic cruelty. He readily embraced de Sade, a favorite writer of the Surreal- ists, and the artist's series of Massacres of the early thirties rival the works of the exquisite Marquis in their investiga- tion of the barbarous, elemental sexual impulse which demands mindless slaughter. Praying mantes made their appearance in Masson's art in 1934 after he had moved to Spain and at a time when he, like Breton and Eluard, had begun to raise them in his own home.47 In his painting of that year, Summer Divertissement (Fig. 9), humanoid mantes are the major protagonists in a bestial orgy. In the middle foreground a large male mantis pursues its fleeing partner while above two male insects rush at a dazzled female trapped between them. In the right foreground a mantis busily eats its mate, a victim of its own impetuous desire, while at the left a grasshopper chokes and gnaws its prey in a sexually provocative pose recalling an earlier photograph illustrating a work by Fabre.48 But the painting's pale lyrical colors form a beautiful tapestry belying the viciousness of the macabre struggle, and it is the 40 It does appear, however, in the title of a painting of 1933, Myself at the Age of Ten When I Was the Grasshopper Child, in which he identified with the appetizing nature of the locust. The table behind which the boy crouches in the painting is the literally interpreted table de salle a' manger whose distorted phallic shape is paralleled by the boy's inviting bread-shaped head. Reproduced in Gerard, Dali, pl. 192. 41 Dali stated, "Gala has Moses's stubbornness, and has saved me from the seven plagues of Egypt, including the plague of locusts" (Descharnes, World of Dali, 23). 42 Reproduced in Rubin, Dada and Surrealist Art, 293. 43 As pointed out by Rosenblum in "Picasso and the Anatomy of Eroticism," 347, n. 22. 44 In making this comparison Pierre de Champris interpreted the arms as protective as well as predatory. He also drew attention to the girl's segmented back which he felt echoed a mantis's abdomen. P. de Cham- pris, Picasso: ombre et soleil, Paris, 1960, 124. 45 The identification of this mantis-like figure at the right of the Crucifixion is not entirely certain, but I am following Ruth Kaufmann's conclusion that it is the Magdalen (R. Kaufmann, "Picasso's Crucifixion of 1930," Burlington Magazine, cxi, Sept. 1969, 557)- 46 Picasso's continuing interest in the mantis is demonstrated by the fact that he has been photographed at least twice with this insect perched on his finger. One photograph by Robert Doisneau, "Picasso examines a praying mantis, 1952," is reproduced in R. Penrose, Portrait of Picasso, New York, 1957, pl. 189, and the other in "Picasso a 90 ans," Jardin des arts, 200-01, July-August, 1971, 55.

Masson has reversed the colors, poetically depicting the victim in green and the attacker in brown as is indeed suggested by the tonal gradations of the black and white photograph. Robert Melville's suggestion that Masson abstracted these insects from the evil monster hybrids of Breughel's Fall of the Rebel Angels is misleading in that it disregards Masson's naturalistic observations and the amoral, exuberant violence of his canvas. See R. Melville, "Andre Masson," Arson, 1942, 25-</page><page sequence="9">608 THE ART BULLETIN contrast between these insects' seductive beauty and their ferocity that provides the keynote of the work.49 In the caption of a reproduction of Summer Divertissement in Verve, Masson invited the viewer to explore this miniature cosmos: "Plunge your head into the summer prairie. Be- neath the arching weeds and the crackle of the star-thistles, you will see the mantes, admirable insects which devour each other as soon as they have mated."50 These words could describe as well a related work, Insects' Betrothal (Fig. Io), in which the locale is a field of arching wheat over which floats a star thistle. The major protagonists closely resemble the prominent foreground pair of Summer Divertisse- ment, although in this instance the male faces the viewer, revealing a dagger-sharp phallus that underscores its sexual aggressiveness. In this diminutive kingdom, death and eroticism are linked in an explosive union. The artist elaborated on his preoccupation with this theme in an interview with Georges Charbonnier: "C'est-a-dire que la mort est dans la face de nous-memes que nous n'6clairons pas, et l'6rotisme c'est la meme chose. L'6rotisme et la mort sont toujours coexistants. C'est ce qui fait d'ailleurs la grandeur de l'6rotisme."51 This concept was explored in the book Eroticism by Georges Bataille, a Surrealist writer who was also Masson's brother- in-law. Bataille saw man as a discontinuous being in search of a primal continuity, a continuity that could only be achieved by tearing down the barriers of individuality, the end result of which is death. The height of erotic activity also offered the promise of a continuous union, and this state of ecstacy could best be reached through an exuberant, transcending violence in harmony with a pitiless nature. Bataille's definition of eroticism was "assenting to life up to the point of death,""52 an excessive affirmation of life which is closely aligned with de Sade's observation that "there is no better way to know death than to link it with some licentious image."53 Although de Sade carried the belief in criminal pleasures to a literally fantastic conclusion, his con- nection of sexual ecstasy with agony and death helped to reawaken man to an awareness of the important role played by violence in human behavior. The Surrealists, and especially Masson, found the praying mantis's uninhibited display of violence a particularly appropriate image for the linking of eroticism and death in a fearful but exhilarating fulfillment. In Masson's Roundelay of 1938 (Fig. Ii) mantes participate in a sexual dance of death revolving around a bursting pomegranate, an ancient symbol of fertility and rejuvena- tion. In his drawing Ily a le charme et le chine enlacds,54 they populate the lower fringe of a violently amorous natural world, while the female mantis in The Procession of Spring55 of 1935 appears as the goddess herself in a triumphal carriage preceded by piping and dancing insect celebrants. In L'Ephdmire (Fig. 12) of this same year Masson apotheo- sized the female mantis. Bathed in a heavenly stream of light she is the ascending Virgin whose amoral nature holds the key to life's mysteries. Suspended in the middle of a circle of awed admirers, the slit of her cruciform body recalls her "divine" function. Two naturalistic mantes are impor- tant components of The Painter and Time (Fig. 13) of 1938. In this attempt to capture time's continuum, art and life merge in the profusion of a ripening nature. The presence of the mantes underscores the indifferent vitality of nature whose principle is to create new life through germinating death in time's endless cycle. In the artist's drawing Semiramis and the Minotaur the mantis is associated with the legendary Babylonian queen in the caption, which reads, "Semiramis: Ishtar, Earth- Mother, Mantis. Minotaur: pre-natal life, bestial murder, death."56 The first group of names represents an archetypal female principle, whose masculine counterpart is the instinctive, brutally creative Minotaur. Each female is a prototype of a seductive but deadly force: Semiramis, the sexually aggressive queen who murdered her partners the morning after their love-making; Ishtar, the cruel goddess of love; and the Earth-Mother, an embodiment of nature's fecundity and indifference. It is not hard to see how the female praying mantis complements and completes this galaxy of cruel beauties, who all share the attributes of the femmefatale. Although writers of the nineteenth century did not refer to the mantis in this context, Mario Praz in The Romantic Agony, written in 1933, employed the metaphor, "like the praying mantis," to describe Cleopatra, a Fatal Woman whose tyrannical and hypnotic beauty was only enhanced by her close association with horror, pain and death.57 The mantis as a femme fatale of the i93o's and I940's, however, was clearly distinguished from its decadent pred- ecessors by its subhuman nature. A terrifying image of 49 In discussing the mantis, Masson referred to "La beautd de cet insecte imperial (bien que le mot 'beautd' ne soit pas dans la vocabulaire surrealiste)" (letter to the author of February, 1972). Masson is also quoted by the poet Georges Limbour as especially appreciating the ephemeral beauty of the insect world: "Les insectes ne sont jamais tres colords, disait-il. Tant qu'ils restent immobiles, ils sont gris et ternes et se confondent avec le decor. II faut qu'ils bougent, ouvrent leurs ailes, montrent leurs dessous; alors apparaissent les plus belles couleurs, mais ils referment leurs merveilles aussit6t et cela n'a durd qu'un instant" (Georges Limbour, "La saison des insectes" in Andre Masson, texts by Barrault, Bataille, Breton, et al., Rouen, 1940, Ioif. 50 A.

It is interesting to note that a few years later Sacheverell Sitwell referred to the mantis in describing a drawing by Fuseli of a woman at her dressing table: "The forms of the figures have some suggestion of the praying mantis about them, that feminine insect which, after preening itself, affects a kneeling or praying posture and kills and devours its companion. It would be ridiculous to suggest that the praying mantis was in the mind of Fuseli when he made this drawing, but it has a spiritual or a subconscious analogy to that atavistic world in which such impossibilities become fact and are the universal rule" (Sacheverell Sitwell, Narrative Pictures, London, 1937, 60o).</page><page sequence="10">THE PRAYING MANTIS IN SURREALIST ART 609 Io Andre Masson, Insects' Betrothal.

The giant, mechanistic frame of its body, stretching across two hills, dominates the landscape, its long shadow reminding one of Dali's atavistic twilights. The barbed vises of its jaw and vagina are organs that are once again related in a grotesque sexual invitation.58 Published a few years later, a series of sequential photographs (Fig. I) in Labyrinthe, the successor of Minotaure, starkly document this insect's sexual rites, opening with the male eagerly soliciting the attentions of its disinterested mate and closing with the unmoved female calmly making its toilette after its vampirish meal.59 The mantis's mimetic qualities by which it disarms and ensnares its prey also reinforced its deadly and treacherous character. John Goodwin wrote in "Remarks on the Poly- morphic Image" how the Indian mantis lured its victims by disguising itself as an innocent flower undulating in the wind.60 In this article concerned with the ambiguous inter- penetration of appearance with reality, the metamorphosis was a magical event in which animate merged with in- animate. The mantis, then, could be viewed not only as a deceitful killer but also as an insectile Daphne achieving a harmonious balance between itself and its environment. With its ability to assimilate into the natural world it was again a symbol of total communion and of man's desire to reintegrate and return to the state of prenatal unconscious- ness.61 It was, like Masson's Minotaur, an image of death and of original and ultimate union. Recalling the camoflage assumed by green grasshoppers and praying mantes on a background of green grasses, Dali was led to speculate on the existence of the phenomenon of mimeticism,62 and Roger Caillois chose to view the artist's "paranoiac double images" solely in terms of mimetic assimilation.63 Masson also demonstrated a fascination with the phenomenon of natural mimicry, and in Roundelay the mantis catching a star thistle is sprouting leaf-like wings. Andr6 Breton and his wife Jacqueline constructed a Surreal- ist object entitled Le petit mimitique consisting of a mantis pinned to a stump.64 The insect is mounted with its wings spread so that it might easily be confused with the stump's flaking bark. 15 Max Ernst, Mantis from Studio 28: L'Age d'or, Paris, 1930 Max Ernst was equally intrigued by alchemical insects as is demonstrated by his painting The Grasshopper65 of 1934, in which this creature appears as a flower blossom. To explain the significance of such transformations, Ernst formulated his principle of collage: "The miracle of the total trans- figuration of beings and objects with or without modifica- tion of their physical or anatomical aspect."66 Isolated 58 A similar vulva is the gateway for a male advancing toward the sun- burst of a new harmony in the drawing You Burst From Your Vein-Stone! You become a dancing god (A. Masson, Mythology of Being, New York, 1942, pl. vii). Masson also explored the theme of the male's sacrificial death in the painting Le repas de la mante of 1937, a photograph of which is in the files of the Galerie Louise Leiris, Paris, and in a bronze entitled Mantes of 1942, in which the spiked jaws have snapped shut locking the copulating pair in an inseparable embrace (reproduced in M. Leiris and G. Limbour, Andrd Masson and his Universe, Geneva and Paris, 1947, pl. 228). It also occurs in a pastel The Praying Mantis of this same year which is reproduced in Andri Masson: Dessins 1922-I960, Galerie Louise Leiris, Paris, 1960, No. 46. In this drawing the male and female insects are abstracted into suggestive biological shapes, whose protean forms, however, are little more than a paraphrase of Picasso's earlier organic metaphors. See, for example, his bathers grappling with fierce decorum and the coupled organs of 1931 in C. Zervos, Pablo Picasso: euvre catalogue, Paris, 1955, VII, pls. 328, 329, 334. 59J.

This same insect was featured in a reprint of a story by Mary Lovejoy of 1893 in a later issue of View in which the incongruous was once again emphasized by this mimetic monster which seems to "pray" but "preys." Dimitri Petrov's illustrations of 1946 hilariously satirize this seemingly innocent tale, depicting the mantis as a phallus stalking an over-reacting matron in a witty reversal of its role as afemmefatale.

Ernst drew a mantis (Fig. 15) as early as 1930 to illustrate a program for L'Age d'or, a film by Luis Bufiuel and Dali in which he appeared. This drawing shows the mantis con- fronting the viewer with its large, mesmerizing eyes and immobile stance, its wings and arms outspread as it entic- ingly displays itself at the same time as it assumes the position of attack. Its suggestion of a cruel passion was an apt crystallization of the film's espousal of violent love, a theme explicitly developed in this accompanying program written by a host of Surrealist writers.69 The pamphlet equated Eros and Thanatos and demanded a bloody liberation from social restraints in the celebration of the profundities of love. The "divine Marquis" was held up as an earlier rebel against the tyranny of an existing order buttressed by a constraining religion.70 The praying mantis was also one of numerous insects that participated in Ernst's turbulent, erotic collage- books. In the second plate of the series in Une semaine de bonte1 which depicts the terrorizing exploits of an animated statue from Easter Island, it is this creature calmly eating its prey that prepares us for the sexual carnage to follow. Ernst's most significant use of the mantis, however, occurs in his painting Lajoie de vivre (Fig. 16) of 1935-36, in which the characterization of the humanoid insects copulat- ing in the foreground is certainly derived from the mantis's sexual habits and its mimetic capabilities. Their green limbs appear like stalks, and one arm seems to end in a cluster of fanning leaves. The wings of the uppermost mantis peel back like husks, while the head is a flecked bud. Their heads also resemble Ernst's abbreviated treatment of birds, linking these insects with the artist's alter ego, Loplop, Bird Superior, a free, soaring spirit of the imagination. In a publication of 1937 devoted to Ernst, these mantes were referred to as "les demoiselles."72 Although less accurate as an entomological description, this reference to dragonflies endowed the insects with an enriching double-entendre evoking an anti-moral love. The environment in which this pair of subhuman lovers grapple is a teeming jungle of ordinarily innocuous plants 67 See M. Ernst, "Inspiration to Order," in Max Ernst: Beyond Painting, 20-25, and Ernst, "Beyond Painting," 12-19, for a discussion of collage and identity. 68 Ernst, "Inspiration to Order," 23f. The concept of accidental en- counters of opposites producing a moment of primary unity was of course a major preoccupation not just of Ernst and Dali but of all the Surrealists. The seminal precedent was Lautreamont's phrase, "Beautiful as the chance meeting upon a dissecting table of a sewing-machine with an umbrella." 69 M. Alexandre, Aragon, A. Breton, R. Char, R.

Such Blakean pronouncements as "He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence" were in accord with their anti- moral, revolutionary ethic. 71 M.

In Lajoie de vivre, the nymph stands on a peak at the upper right accompanied by a strange animal.76 In an article published in the same year the painting was created, Ernst discussed in the third person his involvement with the nymph whom he identified with nature: Regarding "nature" for example, one may discern in him two attitudes, in appearance irreconcilable: that of the god Pan and the man Papou who possesses all the mysteries and realizes the playful pleasure in his union with her ("He marries nature, he pursues the nymph Echo," they say) and that of a conscious and organized Prometheus, thief of fire who, guided by thought, perse- cutes her with an implacable hatred and grossly injures her. "This monster is pleased only by the antipodes of the landscape," they repeat. And a teasing little girl adds: "He is a brain and a vegetable at the same time."77 Ernst's self-identification with the primitive god Pan was appropriate in that Pan excited shepherds to tear Echo to pieces after she refused his amorous advances. This sexual assault ended with Earth hiding the nymph's bones in a total assimilation with nature. As Pan, Ernst was the possessor of a subconscious, vital force belonging to the prolific and destructive natural world; as Prometheus he was a conscious creator whose analytic reason could vitiate nature's mysteries. When these two opposites were juxta- posed in the dynamic union of his "collage," the moment of creation was achieved. In a second painting entitled La joie de vivre of 1936-37 (Fig. 17), the mantes again appear in the left foreground locked head to toe in a bowed embrace. The insect on top is green while the bottom one is a dull red, both colors merg- ing with the surrounding blooming plants. At the right the nymph demurely flees from this impulsive sexual energy, although her right hand languidly clutches an opulent, phallic blossom as does the monster's of the previous paint- ing. A moustached head abruptly appears just behind the nymph's, the body being entirely concealed by the vegeta- tion. This masculine head faces the joined insects which form an expressive image of the joy of living to be found in nature's ferocious, cyclic fertility.78 The mantis continued to be an intriguing image, and there are numerous representations by other artists.79 In the early 1940's two chilling paintings by Felix Labisse re- capitulated much of the Surrealists' fascination with this insect during the previous decade. Perhaps the most explicit image of the mantis in its role as afemmefatale occurs in his L'Aventure permanente of 1944 (Fig. 18). The pose of this voluptuous hybrid at a parapet with one hand placed over her breast recalls numerous Renaissance portraits of erotic females, while the curtain of viscera at the right strikes a more macabre note. It is, however, the figure's bloody hands and her impassive mantis head, subtly altered to suggest male genitals, that make this such a disturbing painting.80 In a gouache Loves of the Mantes of 1943 (Fig. 19) Labisse literally depicted this insect as a symbol of an agonizing communion. Silhouetted against an arid land- scape, where they appear like giant prehistoric creatures, the female has made an excellent beginning in the delect- ation of her spouse. The emblematic circle of eternity formed by this coupling, with its promise of new life to spring from 73 In an evocative article in Minotaure, Ernst described the forest as a place of ferocious and extravagant mystery, conducive to dreaming and belonging to an ancient past, "Les mysteres de la foret," Minotaure, 5, 1934, 6. From his earliest childhood it had impressed him as a realm of "enchantment and terror," M. Ernst, "Some data on the youth of M. E., as told by himself," View, ser. 2, No. I, April, 1942, 28. 74 A caption beneath a reproduction of a detail of this painting addressed the monster with the words, "bonjour monsieur Max Ernst" (Ernst: 1919 a 1936, I 1). Patrick Waldberg mistakenly wrote that this caption reported the monster's greeting to the artist (P. Waldberg, Max Ernst, Paris, 1958, 282). 75 See the two works entitled The Nymph Echo and the paintings The Entire City and Nature at Dawn, reproduced in Ernst: Igr99 ' 1936, 99, I03, io6, 112. 76 She was identified as "la nymphe Echo" in a caption beneath a detail of this painting reproduced in Ernst: ig99 a 1936, 110o. Her animal companion would appear to be a docile relation of the rampaging Lion de Belfort of Une semaine de bonte'. 77 Ernst, "Beyond Painting," 19. 78 Similar mantis-like insects also appear in a setting of congested vegetation in two works of 1943, Painting for Young People and Vox Angelica, reproduced respectively in Waldberg, Max Ernst, 379, and J. Russell, Max Ernst, London, I967, 137. 79 In 1936 Alexander Calder created an erect, jutting mobile entitled Mantis, reproduced in A. Calder, Calder: an Autobiography with Pictures, New York, 1966, 32. Inspired during a visit to southern France in the spring of 1947, Graham Sutherland began a series of works featuring grasshoppers and mantes, which are reproduced in D. Cooper, The Work of Graham Sutherland, London, i961, 98a-f. These brightly rendered insects are often depicted erect and in profile as in a hieratic portrait, or are shown in agonizing couplings. The mantes appear more ferocious than the decorative grasshoppers, and one mantis of 1953 is especially forbidding with its menacing grasshopper-shaped head and bared teeth which remind one of Blake's drawing The Ghost of a Flea. Sutherland, a trustee of the Tate Gallery, was undoubtedly aware of this important acquisi- tion of 1940. The image of the mantis as a sexual cannibal still exerts a creative power. A recent sculpture by Forrest Myers, for example, appears at first a wholly formalist work in two pieces, identical in size and shape, one of Cor-Ten and one of stainless steel, which together form the outlines of a pyramid. Lest we miss the metaphoric suggestions underlying these forms, the title Mantis forces our awareness of the rough pincers of the female poised over its prone mate. Reproduced in Whitney Museum Sculpture Annual 1970, New York, 1970, 57- 80 On another occasion in a lighthearted vein, Labisse humorously employed the pun "L'Amante religieuse" to refer to a drawing of a woman-mantis with deadly charms. She is one of several whimsical but dangerous woman-insect hybrids who populate his book Histoire naturelle, Paris, 1948.</page><page sequence="16">THE PRAYING MANTIS IN SURREALIST ART 615 self-sacrificing death, echoes an earlier statement about the mantis by Fabre: "Elle nous ramine 5 l'antique symbole du serpent qui se mord la queue. Le monde est un cercle revenant sur lui-mime: tout finit afin que tout recommence; tout meurt afin que tout vive."81 The praying mantis proved to be a compelling metaphor for the Surrealists in their exploration of eroticism. Its instinctive and voracious sexuality offered a natural expres- sion of the demonic potential of man's repressed unconscious. The female was depicted as a bestial femme fatale, alluring, detached, and deadly, who destroyed her lover in the very act of mating. Yet this insect's diabolical reflexes led to a divine union, for both its sexual cannibalism and its mimetic pantheism suggested a release from finite bound- aries. The Surrealists felt an intoxicating desire to participate in the total communion of love's fatal embrace with its promise of a liberating absorption. The mantis, then, could also represent the miraculous transformation which occurs in the complete fusion of the artist with the primary external source of inspiration - the beloved.
