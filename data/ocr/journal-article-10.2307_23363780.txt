<plain_text><page sequence="1">MA'ASEH MERKABAH IN SEFER HASIDIM by Nikolaas A. van Uchelen The title of Appendix C in the well-known book by G. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition,1 is "Ma'aseh Merkabah — an unpublished Merkabah-Text" (101-117). About this "Merkabah-Text" Scholem remarks: "I have restored it from the two manuscripts Oxford 1531, folios 50a ff., and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America 828, folios 29a ff. Both manuscripts are from the circle of German Hasidim, who preserved material that came to them from the Orient through Southern Italy" (102). Apart from the title which Wertheimer gave to the text he offered in Volume II of his BateiMidrashot,2 this is, as far as I know, the only time that a so-called "Merkabah-Text" is entitled "Ma'aseh Merkabah".3 As a justification of this title Scholem searched and found good company. His first companion is the ninth-century Gaon of Surah, Natronai bar Hilai. This scholar himself apparently practised mysticism and in one of his reponsa he seems to refer to the Greater Heykhalot as to "ma'aseh merkabah".4 His second witness is the fifteenth-century Spanish-Italian kabbalist Yehuda ben Ya'akov Hayyat.

VAN UCHELEN Ma'areket haElohut, contains a reference to Shi'ur Qomah — fragments as "ma'aseh merkabah".s As an important support for his use of the title "Ma'aseh Merkabah", Scholem mentions the eleventh-century European scholar Shelomoh ben Yishaq, Rashi. In his famous commentary on the Babylonian Talmud, Rashi twice refers to "Baraitha of Ma'aseh Merkabah" (bBer. 51a;bHag. 13a), and in his explanation of Isaiah 6:3, Rashi likewise names the "Midrash Haggadah Ma'aseh Merkabah".6 Because the manuscripts of the text, restored by Scholem, stem from the circles of the Hasidey Ashkenaz, the most welcome support for the use of the title comes from representatives of this circle. In his homiletic tract Sha'arey hasocf El'azar of Worms, following Rambam, battles against anthropomorphic ideas of God. Taking his arguments from revelations to biblical prophets,8 El'azar remarks the following: When the Holy One was willing to reveal Himself and to speak to the prophets He let them see visions, which they would understand in the future. And Israel saw the voice as in a vision. Concerning this passage there are many qal wahomers and midrashim. "And the whole people saw the voices" (Ex. 20:16); "Behold, Adonai the Lord let us see his Glory (kavod), his Greatness (godel) and his Voice (qol)" (Deut. 5:24).9 This is a revelation from the depth. He reveals the depths (or: deep things); that is ma'aseh merkabah; "the depth, the depth, who will find it" (Qoh. 7:25).10 5 See Scholem, op. cit., p.101, note 8. 6 See Scholem, op. cit., p. 101, notes 2-4. 7 See J. Dan, "Sefer sha'arey hasod, hayihud veha'emunah lerabbi El'azar meWorms," in Temirin. Texts and Studies in Kabbala and Hasidim, ed. by I. Weinstock, Jerusalem 1972, pp. 141-156. 8 See J. Dan, op. cit., Mavo, pp. 141, 142. 9 The text continues with the following words: "(and his voice) we heard from the fire." These words, however, obviously do not fit in the exegetical argumentation of El'azar, so his quotation breaks off in the middle. 10 For the combination 'omeq hamerkabah, see J. Dan, "Sefer hahokhmah lerabbi El'azar meWorms umashma'uto letoledot toratah we sifrutah shel hasidut ashkenaz," Zion 29 (1964), pp. 168-181, espec. 170. [44*]</page><page sequence="3">MA'AS EH MERKABAH IN SEFER HASIDIM With some instances derived from the text bBer., El'azar informs his readers that revelations and visions of the kind of the prophetic writings only can be seen with the inward eye, in a manner of speaking: with the heart. Such visions are only to be known be'uvneta delibba or bekiwwun halev or bire'iyat halev. So much is clear, El'azar uses the phrase ma'aseh merkabah here as a circumscription or indication of a milta 'amiqta. The vision of Gods kavod, his godel and his qol is a deep hidden thing: zeh ma'aseh merkabah. In Sodey razayya,11 a collection of five esoteric tracts written by El'azar, we find a few instances of the phrase ma'aseh merkabah, all of them seemingly as an indication of a milta 'amiqta. We find the first text with this phrase in the tract hilkot hakisse'. Describing the heavenly throne and its surroundings, El'azar enumerates classes of angels: "there are three of them, as one also will find three times 'ani ledodi in Shir haShirim."12 In his exegesis of Shir haShirim 7:12, El'azar gives the following argumentation: "we'elaw teshuqato 10 ne'emar, kemo we'eleka teshuqato (Gen. 4:7). Welama 'amar-we 'alayl (Because this means:) she teshuqat ma'aseh merkabah 'al demut Yisra'el — zehu: she yasad 'al Yisra'el ga'awato." According to the traditional allegorical interpretation, Shir haShirim deals with the partnership of the Holy One and his people Israel. It is from this evident presupposition that El'azar unfolds a part of his particular exegesis, namely: teshuqato = teshuqat Adonai = teshuqat ma'aseh merkabah.13 Consequently we find the phrase 11 Ed. I. Kamelhar, Bilgoraj 1936. See for this edition J. Dan, Torat hasod shel Chasidut Ashkenaz, Jerusalem 1968, p. 62. 12 In fact one will find twice 'aniledodi (6:13; 7:12) and once we'anilo (2:16); compare Kamelhar, p. 18. 13 See for this exegetical substitution BerR. XX, 7 (J. Theodor, Ch. Albeck,Midrash Bereshit Rabba, Jerusalem 1965, pp. 190,191; also AfcfawA Shir haShirim (printed from a geniza fragment), E. H. Grunhut 1897; J. Ch. Wertheimer, Jerusalem 1981, pp. 116,117. In consequence of this substitution the following wordsdemut yisra'el seem to refer to one of the Chayyot, "the Living Creatures" surrounding the heavenly Throne; compare e.g. P. Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, Tiibingen 1981, par. 296 (B238), par. 406 (N 8128). נ *45]</page><page sequence="4">NIKOLAAS A. VAN UCHELEN "ma'aseh merkabah" here in a rather unexpected application: namely as a synonym for the Holy One. The second text with this phrase in Sodey razayya is in hilkot hakavod, the context of which apparently has an eschatological tenor. Quoting two prophetical texts (Is. 11:9; Hab. 2:14), El'azar writes: "when the Glory will be revealed over everything, those are the days that the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,..., for the ma'aseh merkabah shall be the sevenfold of the light of seven days.'"4 El'azar here produces an exegetical paraphrase of Is. 30:26, where we read: "and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days." El'azar substitutes the biblical phrase of Isaiah ('or hahammah) by the phrase under consideration (ma'aseh merkabah), stating that as the light of the sun is as strong as the light of seven days, so the (light of the) ma'aseh merkabah is seven times as strong as the sunlight. However this may be, the phrase in the text also has a peculiar meaning for it circumscribes in one way or another the world of heavenly light. Or, in the words of El'azar himself, the phrase has the connotation if not the denotation of a milta 'amiqta. If anywhere, then here, in the writings of El'azar, Scholem finds his support for the title "Ma'aseh Merkabah" above his restored Merkabah-Text.15 Scholem's restored Merkabah-Text, in a strict sense describes the 'omeq hamerkabah; it stems from manuscripts which originate from the Hasidey Ashkenaz. One of the most important representatives of the Hasidey Ashkenaz uses the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah" several times, also denotating in a general sense the "omeq hamerkabah.16 See Kamelhar, op. cit., pp. 33, 34. Besides this helpful support Scholem also refers to a Heykhalot-text: "Indeed the manuscript Munich 22 of the Greater and Lesser Hekhalot concludes with the following remark on folio 164b: 'finished is the book Ma'aseh Merkabah'"; see Scholem, op. cit., p. 101. This remark, however, forms the end of a paragraph, which P. Schäfer, op .cit., identifies as 'Sondergut' (XVI), most probably to be attributed to a copyist or editor from the circles of the Hasidey Ashkenaz; compare Schäfer, op. cit., S. 299, M 22, par. 985 with S. 182, M 22, par. 427. The question if it is the same 'omeq or what kind of'omeq is meant, can be left unanswered here. The point of comparison between the 'omeq of Scholem's Merkabah-text and the 'omeq of the merkabah in El'azar's writings may lie in the idea of the "tremendum ac fascinosum". [46*]</page><page sequence="5">MA'ASEH MERKABAH IN SEFER HASIDIM But, having arrived at this point we have to stress that El'azar of Worms in this respect is not the only representative of the Hasidey Ashkenaz. As a matter of fact, in his writings he represents one stream of this multiform pietistic-esoteric movement in medieval Germany. Within this movement his concern above all was the torat hasod.17 El'azar's spiritual orientation was especially the individual esoteric piety, more than often as a guidance to mystical experience.18 Another important representative to be mentioned in this connection is Yehudah heHasid. As a predecessor and teacher of El'azar, this scholar also uses the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah", the occurrence and meaning of which in Sefer Hasidim we shall try to trace now. Though not of frequent occurrence, we already come upon the use of the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah " at the very beginning of Sefer Hasidim, namely in the machberet hayir'ah.19 We first have to briefly clear up the context in order to understand the use of the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah" in the text itself. The context deals with the famous theme of the resourcefulness in the fear of God. The key-sentence of this theme is: "Man forever has to be resourceful in fearing God, because he will be punished for what he did not know" — that is to say, for his inadvertence — she yehe 'adam 'arum beyir'ah ho'iyl uma'anishin 'oto 'al she'eyn yodea'. One of the consequences of this resourcefulness is the responsibility of the pious believer for his neighbour, even when this neighbour is a wicked man (rasha').20 Moreover, the Pietist is required to warn and to reprove the non-Pietist on account of his wicked deeds; the believer is See J. Dan, Torat hasod, op. cit., pp. 61-64; also J. Dan, Sefer hahokhmah, op. cit., pp. 174, 177. See I.G. Marcus, Piety and Society. The Jewish Pietists of Medieval Germany, Leiden 1981, p. 109. See Sefer Hasidim, ed. J. Wistinetzki and J.Freimann, Berlin 1981, Frankfurt am Main 1921 p. 3; for the same passage, see also p. 161 (par. 588); for machberet hayir'ah, see Freimann, Mavo, pp. 11, 13. For the meaning of this indication in Sefer Hasidim, see H. Soloveitchik, "Three themes in Sefer Hasidim", AJS Review I (1976), pp. 311-357, espec. pp. 330-334; also I.G. Marcus, op. cit., pp. 61-65. [47*]</page><page sequence="6">NIKOLAAS A. VAN UCHELEN "obligated to tell the sinner about his error",21 as is written in Ez. 3:18 19: vs. 18: "When I say unto the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; — and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand, vs. 19: Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." One of the wicked deeds, an error of the non-Pietist particularly, happens to be the neglect of certain laws: miswot she'eyn lahem 'oseqin. To the neglected or disregarded laws (miswot bezuyyot) belong for instance the reading of Seder Qodashim (various offerings to bring the Temple, which however did not exist anymore), Mo'ed Qatan (the Talmudic tract, some chapters of which deal with matters of death, burial and funeral orations) and He whose dead lies unburied before him (halakhic rules in the Talmudic tract Berakhot, in connection with death, mourning and burial, mBer. Ill, 1-2). If a non-Pietist shows disregard, the Pietist has to reprove him and otherwise himself to perform the obligation, namely the study of the Talmudic passage under consideration, even when the passage is not popular or — as people say — full of danger.22 It is not so difficult to figure out oneself this kind of danger. It is not attractive at all to be so closely involved with regulations about dead persons or matters of death; one puts oneself in danger, running the risk of attracting death itself. See Marcus, op. cit., p. 87; see for this motif of "communal responsibility" as "one of the leitmotifs of Sefer Hasidim", also Soloveitchik, op. cit., pp. 325-327; compare also Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sefer haMadda', hilkhot de'ot VI, 7 (Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem, 1981'). "Danger" (sakkanah) in Sefer Hasidim on the one hand has a physical meaning, connected with places of danger (compare Wistinetzki, par. 13, pp. 166,683,1722) or dangerous illnesses (pp. 1542, 1551); on the other hand we find a more figurative meaning, two times in connection with limmud torah (pp. 1489, 1765). [48*]</page><page sequence="7">MA'ASEH MERKABAH IN SEIER HASIDIM In this respect the text is rather concrete: "Of two things I heard the angel of death is near to hear; he is near to the one who studies ma'aseh merkabah and mo'ed qatan. That is why the angel of death said: "that exactly is ma'aseh merkabah (hen hen ma'aseh merkabah.).'" Our concern now is not the use — or better here: the abuse of the expression mal'akh hamawet in this connection.23 We are first and foremost interested in the juxtaposition of mo'ed qatan, a text to be read and studied, with ma'aseh merkabah, apparently also a text to be read and studied. The meaning of the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah" is delineated by the context, which has an ethical-exhortative tenor: after having admonished the non-Pietist to do so, the Pietist himself has the obligation to study neglected texts even if they are unpopular or dangerous. The second instance of the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah" in Sefer Hasidim we find in par. 796, the context of which has an exegetical tenor. In this passage we come upon the hermeneutical credo of the writer and his followers. The text has already been dealt with in a lucid explanation by Marcus in his study Piety and Society.24 At Sinai a threefold Oral Torah was given; one for the whole people (kol yisra'el), consisting of aggadah, midrash and talmud. This was the Torah with the surface meaning, according to Deut. 1:1. The second Oral Torah was for the rabbinic scholars (harifim), consisting of the hermeneutical rules, such as the middot of qal wahomer and gezerah shawwah. This was the Torah with the regulated or adjusted meaning, according to Deut. 1:3. The third Oral Torah was the highest one, intended only for the pietistic initiates (senu'im). By means of this dispensation the deep truth and the hidden treasures of Scripture could be found. The specific meaning of this dispensation has to be derived from Deut. 1:5—ho'iyl 23 As a matter of fact rabbinic sources only make mention of an "angel" (mal'akh) whose words in jHag 77a are: ken hu ma'aseh hamerkabah and in bHag 14b: hen hen ma'aseh hamerkabah. 24 See Marcus, op. cit., pp. 65-67. [49*]</page><page sequence="8">NIKOLAAS A. VAN UCHELEN moshe bi'er hatorah. This particular torah has to be conceived of (in the words of Marcus) as: " a body of secret lore about how to interpret properly liturgy and Scripture" (65). This secret lore deals with semukhin (juxtaposition or collocation of different scriptural sections), remez sodot (scriptural texts hinting at secret lore), meqom shemot (scriptural texts pointing at divine names), tagin (crown-like designs above special scriptural letters revealing secret meaning) and ma'aseh merkabah (the esoteric exegesis of the scriptural text of Ez. 1). With respect to the exegetical context of this passage we are not interested in the references or indications as such. Of specific import, however, is what they refer to or what they indicate. Without exception their object is Scripture, either sections or verses or words. In this series of references to Scripture we thus come upon the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah". This third and highest Oral Torah, the secret lore which Moses entrusted to the pietistic initiates, enables them to understand the hidden treasures of the scriptural text of Ez. 1.25 The meaning of the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah" here also is delineated by its context, which has an outspoken exegetical character: the pietistic believers are the initiates who are acquainted with the deep truth of Scripture. The last instance of the use of the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah" does not differ so much from the former two. In the paragraph under consideration now, namely 1521, we find a comparison between the scholars of Babylonia and Eretz Yisra'el. The translation of the last part of the paragraph runs as follows: "Do not wonder at the learned scholars of Babylonia — they know ma'aseh merkabah and they know torah, and apart from torah (also) nevi'im and ketuvim, but the fire was not flowing around them; as (on the contrary) happened to the learned scholars of eretz yisra'el: (that happened) because of the merit of eretz yisra'el is of much profit to torah." 25 Which of course is not quite the same as "the significance of the divine throne" (Marcus, p. 67). [50*]</page><page sequence="9">MA'ASEH MERKABAH IN SEFER HASIDIM In the former paragraph the secret lore of the oral tradition was reckoned to be the means to find the hidden truth of Scripture. In this paragraph another element has been added: now the zekhut eretz yisra'el happens to be seen as an exegetical profit. Thanks to this element the scholar is able to dig up the hidden treasures of Scripture and to bring to the surface the esoteric meaning of the text of the torah and of the text indicated as ma'aseh merkabah. The use and the meaning of the phrase "ma'aseh merkabah" in Sefer Hasidim does not seem to be quite the same as we found so far in some other writings of the Hasidey Ashkenaz. We are not misinterpreting the occurrences by saying that the phrase in the other writings, especially of El'azar, has an esoteric meaning as such. Without exception ma'aseh merkabah in all those occurrences referred to a milta 'amiqta, in general to a heavenly world, to the kavod, the godel of God or the Holy One himself. As often as we found the phrase in Sefer Hasidim, however, the context without exception demonstrated the so-called scriptural meaning. Ma'aseh merkabah in the work of Yehuda heHasid denotates the text and the exegesis of a part of Scripture, namely chapter I of Ezekiel. A final remark of Halperin in view of the classical rabbinic sources may be applicable to Sefer Hasidim: "Whatever the precise nuance of ma'aseh merkabah may have been, these sources represent it as having been focused on Scriptural exegesis, not on experience of the Divine. Merkabah exegesis may indeed bring supernatural rewards or disasters to its practitioners, but these are represented as 'side effects'".26 We have to see the Hasidut Ashkenaz as a spiritual movement consisting of several component parts or of partly divergent streams. One stream represented at least by Sefer Hasidim, conspicuously does not stress the torat 'elohut, as has been convincingly demonstrated by J. Dan.27 That may be the reason why 26 See D.J. Halperin, The Merkabah in Rabbinic Sources (American Oriental Series 62), New Haven, Connecticut 1980, p. 179. As the "reward" in Sefer Hasidim may be seen the 'esh\ as the "disaster" of course the possibility of sakkanah. 27 See J. Dan, Toral hasod, op. cit., p. 57 et passim. [51*]</page><page sequence="10">NIKOLAAS A. VAN UCHELEN Shir haShirim, elsewhere an important source for torat 'elohut, is hardly if at all quoted in Sefer Hasidim.2* That may also be the reason why ma'aseh merkabah, elsewhere an important element in torat 'elohut, in Sefer Hasidim only has a textual and exegetical meaning. 28 See R.
