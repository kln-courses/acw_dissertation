Cambridge University Press and New York: Macmil- lan Co., 1940. Pp. xxix+1299+83 pls. and 930 figs. (in two parts). $35 (price for set of three vols., $82). The first volume of this great work, Zeus, God of the Bright Sky, appeared in 1914; the sec- ond, Zeus, God of the Dark Sky (Thunder and Lightning), in 1925 (in two parts); this is the third and concluding instalment. The sub- title, A Study in Ancient Religion, indicates, but does not exhaust, the book's range: almost every aspect of ancient life is treated or touched. This is due in part to the author's breadth of interest and enthusiasm, in part to the fact that ancient religion penetrated an- cient life, "and there is none of these things that is not Zeus." You must consult Cook's Zeus not only as you consult Roscher's Lexikon but also as you do Pauly-Wissowa and Darem- berg-Saglio, and you will very seldom come away empty-handed. It is a superbly indexed thesaurus of ancient life and of its survivals and parallels in folklore; many works of art are here published for the first time; the quo- tations are commonly in extenso; atid in twenty years of using the work as it has grown I have not found a significant error in the references.' As Frazer said, "while theories are transitory, a record of facts has a permanent value." Cook is equally at home in literature and archaeology and folk tale and has the rare gift not only of digesting and recording facts but also of re- porting the interpretations of others with pa- tient generosity; he gives the biography of the questions which he discusses, and he is always clear and readable. A mere list of headings ("Zeus and the Earthquakes," "Zeus and the Clouds," "Zeus I On p. 100, n. 5, her. 6. 4 should be 5.3; on p. 420, insert "III" between Hist. Alex. Maani and 17. 27 f. and the Wind," "Zeus and the Dew," "Zeus and the Rain," "Zeus and the Meteorites," "General Conclusions with Regard to Zeus as God of the Dark Sky, " appendixes on "Floating Islands," "The Prompting Eros," "The Hieros Gamos": "Addenda") gives no clue to the vol- ume's richness. It includes admirable mate- rial and suggestions on a coin illustrating II. xx. 56 if. (p. 6); the decline of Poseidon (pp. 21 f.); Roman and Indian adaptations of a Greek art type (pp. 39 ff.); the Birds of Aris- tophanes (pp. 44 ff.; Basileia is explained in terms of the Argive Hera, who may have sup- plied a suggestion to Aristophanes;2 inciden- tally, full material is provided on the giant Porphyrion); the Tritopatores and Tritons (pp. 112 ff.);3 Iuppiter Secundanus (pp. 155 f., with a brilliant explanation of Martianus Ca- pella i. 47); the snake-goddess (p. 189); ritual vases (pp. 191 ff.); the pentagram (p. 341, n. 3); loutrophoroi (pp. 370 if.); Cerberus (p. 403, n. 1); a rain of blood as a portent (pp. 478 ff.) ;4 the constellation Engonasin (pp. 483 ff.); the Phrygian flood-story (pp. 527 ff.); Zeus-types on early Indian coins (pp. 532 ff.);5 a rap- prochement between a coin of Stratonicea and an inscription of Panamara (p. 568); Europa on the bull (pp. 615 ff.); art representations of the birth of Athena (pp. 657 ff.); laughter as intensifying the prophylactic value of an amu- let (pp. 803 f.); Hesiod Theog. 384 (p. 811, n. 1: reading NeLKflV); a Sumerian relief represent- ing a supernatural being with two owls (pp. 832 ff.: Sidney Smith's convincing rebuttal of Cook's own view that this is a remote ances- tress of Athena is reported with characteristic candor); the aegis and Gorgoneion (pp. 837 ff.: 2 But (1. 1633) Basileia must be distinct from Hera. 3 On whom cf. now Ch.

LXVII); meteorites in general (pp. 920 if.) ;7 the throne of Zeus at Olympia (pp. 955 if.); the kalathiskos dance (pp. 999 if.); the Twelve Gods at Pompeii (p. 1062: "It may be doubted whether their religious significance was much greater than that of our own Apos- tle-spoons"). Patience, precision, and zest could hardly find more striking expression than in the 132 pages of addenda, which are full of good things, e.g., pp. 1161 ff., on mountain cults of Zeus, supplementing the magnificent collection of evidence in II, 868 f.;8 p. 1148, Fig. 896, a gem from Macedonia, with Zeus and Sarapis, and the word QMO2A, "I have sworn." Cook remarks: "Fairly good Hellen- istic work. Possibly the seal of some public functionary." If so, it indicates the high stand- ing of Sarapis, as at Thessalonica and in Boeotia. Further, the general sketch of the signifi- cance of Zeus as god of the Dark Sky (pp. 943 ff.) does full justice to the intellectual and moral factors in men's attitudes toward a sky- god and to the central position of Zeus in Greek piety. Personal names derived from Zeus are second in number only to those de- rived from Apollo; but other deities-Apollo, Demeter, Dionysus-came to outshine him in festivals, month-names, temples, and cult- images.9 Nevertheless, Zeus was the supreme being, even if he had neither image nor temple. You could still, like Agamemnon (II. viii. 238), 6 For Ridgeway's suggestion (p. 841, n. 1) that the goatskin was once ordinary apparel cf. Theognis 55 (also the wood-man Engidu, in Br. Meissner, Baby- lonien u. Assyrien, II, 192). 7 Did the early use of meteoric iron have anything to do with the growth of superstitions relating to iron (on which cf. M. Cary and A. D. Nock, Class. Quart., Vol. XXI [19271)? 8 Add D. M. Robinson, Trans. Amer. Philol. Assoc., LXIX (1938), 72 (and now J. M. R. Cormack, Jour. Rom. Stud., XXXI [19411, 19 ff.) for Zeus Hypsistos in Macedonia and L.

The altar was the central datum of worship (Aesch. Agam. 88 ff.). Our conception of Greek wor- ship is necessarily much influenced by the Acropolis of Athens, by Olympia, Delphi, and Bassae; and yet even at Olympia until well into the fifth century Zeus was worshiped at his al- tar alone.'0 The Periclean building program expresses a desire for monumentality rather than the intrinsic religious importance of tem- ples qua temples: Greece never had the Ro- man natales templorum. To return, Cook's statement (pp. xii f.) that in the development from primitive pagan- ism toward complete Christianity "the cult of the Sky-god was one main factor, leading the minds of men upwards and onwards to ever greater heights till Zeus at his noblest joined hands with the Christian conceptions of Deity" seems to me fundamentally true, if we interpret "cult" in a broad sense (might we rather say "the concept of Zeus as Sky-god, father of gods and men, and Supreme Being"?). In the beginning was the Mycenaean concept, formulated in epic, of Zeus as sky-god, house- hold-god, and royal god;" then came the heightened moralistic emphasis of Hesiod, the occasional but emphatic references of the lyric poets, the quasi-prophetic attitude of Aeschy- lus, and the adoption by philosophers of the name Zeus to describe a religious and cosmic absolute which at the same time had a personal name and (in contrast to India) remained he rather than it. To Cleanthes and to various thinkers from the beginning of our era the name Zeus was not merely a legacy from the past to which lip service must be paid but the expression of living, causal, provident reality. Zeus was a Greek god (Hellanios), but his home was the mountaintop and the sky, and he was elemental and not merely Greek, caring for men though they perished (II. xx. 21). For all the importance which he acquired in civic life, Io Wilamowitz, op. cit., pp. 102 f. The Athenian fail- ure to complete the Pisistratid temple to Zeus Olympios probably shows political revulsion rather than re- ligious indifference. Aristotle (Pol. v. 9. 4, p. 1313 b 23) mentions the temple among the great public works undertaken by tyrants to keep their subjects busy and poor. 11 Cf. M. P. Nilsson, Arch. f. Rel., XXXV (1938), 156 ff.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 53 he was never a political god to anything like the extent of Juppiter Optimus Maximus or even of Athena in fifth-century Athens. So the name Zeus came to mean not only "sky-god" but "god, theos, par excellence"; and its applica- tion to other deities is something more than interpretatio Graeca, something different from the application of the name of Apollo or Her- mes.12 "Reviewers in general have been benevolent but superficial and sometimes woefully misun- derstanding," observes Cook;'3 mere praise of- fends, he does not need it; and we must come to points of difference. In spite of a wealth of pre- cisely dated evidence and a recognition of de- velopment in matters large and small (includ- ing p. 794, a progress of Athena from the orni- thomorphic to the anthropomorphic, which I cannot accept'4), the book shows at times a cer- tain lack of historical sense and an excessive re- liance on the hypothesis of folk memory. It is indeed true that some religious ideas appear to follow a course somewhat like those Greek rivers which disappear in chasms below the earth and come to the surface later (Manichae- an dualism in medieval Europe is a case in point; "verus propheta per saecula currens," 12 Cf. below, p. 54, and note that in R. Reitzen- stein, W. Cr6nert, W. Spiegelberg, "*Die gr. Tefnut- legende," Sitzu,ngsber. Heidelberg., 1923, Part, IV, p. 27, Phre is rendered by "Zeus," not by "Helios" (ex- cept in one Homeric reminiscence). Also the inference by Pausan. x. 37. 3 that Megistos, the title of chief deity of the men of Bulis, must be an appellative of Zeus. 13 To the exceptions which he makes add G. F. Hill, Jour. Hell. Stud., XXXV (1915), 149 ff., and now H. J. Rose, Jour. Theol. Stud., XLI (1940), 317 ff., E. Riess, Class. Weekly, XXXIV (1940), 75 ff. F. R. Walton, Amer. Journ. Arch. XLVI (1942). 447 ff.; C. Bonner, Class. Jour. (forthcomring). 14 Are not Cook's stages to be regarded as diverse modes of artistic representation rather than succeeding concepts'? Athena's owl can be iconographic short- hand: the human-headed owl engaged in spinning on Tarentine terra cottas (p. 795) is surely a jeu d'esprit rather than a survival: and so are the helmeted owl and the owl with female helmeted head (p. 801, the archaistic legend with the last was regular from ca. 229 B.C. to the time of Augustus and proves nothing). Cult types presented as such may be revivals or sur- vivals. These representations are not of either kind. Against any hypothesis of distinct succeeding theriomorphic and anthropomorphic stages cf. L. R. Farnell, Greece and Babylon, pp. 14, 51 ff., 69, and At- tributes of God, p. 23. For the contrast between con- ception and art type cf. J. M. C. Toynbee, Jour. Rom. Stud., XXXI (1941), 200. and the king or prophet, like "der alte Bar- barossa," hidden away and destined to return, are others). Yet these recurrent ideas are asso- ciated with emotions of obvious strength; it is a very different thing to suppose that II. xv. 309 f. suggests that "Zeus got his aigis from Hephaistos, the consort of Athena" (pp. 866 f.)-for the obvious explanation is that here, as elsewhere, Hephaestus is simply the divine craftsman, not Athena's supposed consort-and that various similar concepts lie behind the Parthenon frieze (p. 737), or to say "the owl of Athena, as we now perceive, was virtually equivalent to the eagle of Zeus. The equation seems to have struck the Greeks themselves in Hellenistic times" (pp. 793-94). The evidence is coins of Pergamon with owl on winged thun- derbolt and AOHNA* NIKH4)OPOY, etc., and coins of Acmoneia and of Alexander I Balas with Zeus and an owl. But Athena was so closely linked to Zeus that it was natural to associate his attribute with her or with her em- blem (cf. pp. 868 if.); the Homeric "O Father Zeus and Athena and Apollo" is eminently sug- gestive for the Macedonian background, in which she is well represented;-5 and very early Seleucid issues have obv. Zeus, rev. Athena.'6 Athena was an important deity at Acmoneia (B. M. Cat. Phrygia, pp. 4f., Nos. 1-2, 6-9; p. 6, No. 15, obv. Athena rev. eagle; and p. 12, No. 55); and the owl may be a shorthand refer- ence to her (cf. coins of Synnada, ibid., p. 393, Nos. 8-9, obv. eagle, rev. owl). As for the coins of Balas, they were struck at Cyrrhus in Syria; to say nothing of the general strength of Athena and the influence in Syria of the Par- thenos type,17 there may be a specific reference to the famous royal cult of Athena Cyrrhes- tis.18 In fact, these are secondary derivative developments and not a reflection of "quod ubique quod semper." For Cook, Zeus is almost a person whose 15 W. Baege, De Macedonum sacri8 ("Diss. phil. Hal.," Vol. XXII, 1), pp. 27 if. Hera attained no cor- responding predominance (p. 19). The appearance on coins of Tarentum and Heraclea Lucaniae of owl on thunderbolt must be explained from general con- siderations. 16 E. T.

(1895), p. 209.</page><page sequence="4">54 BOOK REVIEWS story he tells, and so are the other deities, listed as they are in Index I: "Persons, Places, Festivals." The idea that some ceremonies are predeistic and independent of the anthropo- morphisms of myth hardly receives enough at- tention. Cook even coimects the ritual of the Buphonia with the story of Athena's birth; but they are incommensurable things, arising from altogether different levels of Greek religion. (The juxtaposition of the two in Pausanias i. 24.5, mentioned p. 657, is clearly a matter of topographic description and does not prove any inner nexus.) In general, the treatment of Athenian festivals is the least satisfying thing in the book. Of necessity it was a long time in the press, and L. Deubner's Attische Feste clearly did not reach the author in time to be used before page 578. Even so, Cook does not seem to realize the strength of Deubner's con- tentions (e.g., on the arrhephoroil9) or, again, of many of Nilsson's arguments (e.g., p. 722, n. 7, on the pinax of Ninnion). On pages 147 f. Cook quotes various state- ments connecting the sanctuary of Zeus Ourios on the Thracian Bosporus with the Argonaut legend and argues that the cult was essentially Aeolian and directed to a deified warrior-king. Klek (in Roscher, Vol. VI, col. 120) has shown that the link with the Argonauts is late and derivative, and this point need not be pressed; but the argument that particular Zeus cults are based on the worship of deified men of the Fra- zerian type or otherwise recurs on pages 160 f. (Euanemos, formerly the hero Pleuron) and pages 269 f. (Aristaeus). In other words, the name Zeus was used as a title. That is not to be denied. A proper name may be expected to denote one person and one only; but by a transference or metonymy it is made to denote a type of person, as we see in the addition of rts ("some," "it may be": Aesch. Agam. 55 and Liddell-Scott-Jones, pp. 1796 f.; also Pind. Pyth. 3. 67) or of such an ad- jective as "second," "new,"20 or in the use of 19 Cook's view that Herse is a later addition to Aglauros and Pandrosos is conflrmed by the decree published by W. S. Ferguson (Hesperia, vII [1938], 1 ff., esp. 21 on i. 1. 11 f.: -riv (sC. Zepwri'7') -riS 'AyXabpo Kai flav5p60o cai Tfs KopoTp6Oo; cf. 1. 45). 20 Nock, Jour. Hell. Stud., XLVIII (1928), 34 if. Note also the application of names of countries, e.g., Asia and Hellas (as distinct from derivatives there- the plural to designate a category (e.g., "hu- mani Ioues, Maecenates") or in the formation of compounds (e.g., Zt7vo7rooEt6Lv, 'HXtoo-apairts, ALovuvoaXkavSpos).21 Poor Menecrates took his self-equation with Zeus seriously; but in gen- eral such things describe a character or rank or posture, in relation to the world or to particu- lar people.22 Zeus Hypsistos alternates with theos hypsistos. Nevertheless, worship of Trophonius, Aris- taeus, Amphiaraus (as again of Sarapis, As- clepius, Bacchus) existed before they were identified with Zeus, and the identification was far from invariable. The fluidity of usage is very great: in Pindar Pyth. 9.63 ff. Chiron says to Apollo that the son whom Cyrene will bear to him is to be Zeus, holy Apollo, Agreus, Nomios, and called by some Aristaios. That is, men will invoke him by these names. Aristaeus was almost certainly a minor deity. The view that he was a man deified by grateful humanity may go back to Dicaearchus,23 but there is no reason to make it more ancient; and he may be classed with Ino-Leucothea, Semele, Helen, Ariadne, Hyacinthus (and possibly Tropho- nius) in the small group of old divinities early transformed by myths into human beings and sometimes given a subsequent apotheosis (so Odyss. v. 334). Nevertheless, we see the same principle in the civic deification of Seleucus I as Seleukos Zeus Nikator at Seleucia Pieriae but from), and of abstractions to persons as their names; (Friedlaender and Wissowa, Sittengeschichte Roms [9th ed.3, IV, 197 if.) on the giving of the names of famous artistes to later performers in the same lines; also A. H. Gardiner, The Theory of Proper Names, pp. 17 if. 21 On a curious pluralization of Men cf. E. Peterson, EI2 OEOE, p. 270; on compounds cf. H. Usener, Kleine Schriften, IV, 337, and Cook, I, 603. 22 Cf. 0. Gruppe, Gr. Myth. Rel., pp. 1093 f.; 0. Weinreich, Menekcrates Zeus u. Salmoneus; Nock, op. cit., p. 31, nn. 51-52; and Amer. Jour. Phil., LXIII (1942), 217 if.; at a humorous level, Aristoph. Au. 716, 722. 23 E. Norden, Sitzungsber. Berlin, 1934, p. 648 n. The deiflcation of Heracles for merit is as early as Pindar: the extension of the category, foreshadowed by Prodicus, is Hellenistic. Pindar's statement about the upbringing of Aristaeus suggests the pre-Greek divine foundling children whom Nilsson has taught us to recognize (cf. L. R. Farnell, Greek Hero Cults, p. 50, and Kern, op. cit., I, 133). Plain apotheosis, with- out a moral motive, was one way of giving background to a cult which had no history in the ordinary tradition (so Hesiod Frag. 100 [123]; Iphigenia did not die but by the decision of Artemis was Hecate).</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 55 simply Seleukos Nikator at Antioch in Persis, Basileus Seleukos Nikator at Dura, and Theos Seleukos in an unknown town; and of Antio- chus I as Antiochos Soter at Antioch in Persis and Seleucia on the Tigris and Antiochos Apol- Ion Soter at Seleucia Pieriae.24 Add to this the fact that in formal documents Apollo was the ancestor, as in legend the father, of Seleucus, just as Aristaeus is both son of Apollo and a functional Apollo, and it becomes clear that these are varieties of emphasis and expression, not rival concepts. The titulature is secondary, the status primary; the name Zeus added dig- nity.25 To come to points of detail, on page 100 the view, developed by Nilsson (Harv. Theol. Rev., XXVIII, [1935], 193), and I. M. Linforth (The Arts of Orpheus, pp. 125 ff.),26 that the cylix there considered represents Apollo as com- manding a youth (possibly Musaeus) to write down what the severed head of Orpheus is singing must surely be preferred to Robert's interpretation, adopted by Cook, that Apollo commands the head to cease from uttering oracles. This latter theory rests upon Philostr. Ap. Ty. iv. 14-a tale almost certainly due to Philostratus or some kindred spirit.27 Apollo's outstretched hand has, as Furtwangler re- marked, a protective aspect.28 In any event, Apollo stands behind the head; surely, if he were forbidding it to speak, he would face it. On the new Attic hydria published by Cook (P1. XVI), Apollo faces the head; but here his gesture is, I think, one of grief. (It is certainly hard to believe with Cook that the woman be- 24 E. Bikerman, Institutions des S6leucides, pp. 242 ff. 25 H. J. Rose, Primitive Culture in Greece, p. 62. The name of Zeus, like that of Artemis, had a certain absorptive power (cf. Usener, op. cit., p. 261, on the divine names which survived as such and not as ap- pellatives). 25 Published after Zeus, Vol. III. 27 Heroicus 5. 3 embroiders the popular theme of the singing head in another way (after an obviously individual elaboration of a variant on the tale of Philoctetes). Cf. in general Ed. Meyer, Herm., Vol. LII (1917), and W. R. Halliday, Folklore Studies, pp. 156 ff. 28 Ant. Gemmen, III, 249. Cf. the slightly different gesture in Zeus, III, 457, Fig. 294, and the epithet urep5tos (Chr. Blinkenberg, Mel. Bidez, pp. 27 ff.).

Was she ever repre- sented as being so far from Delphi? The bay- leaves in her hair do not exclude the possibility of her being Calliope,29 or she may be no more than a pendant to the heartbroken woman standing behind the god.)30 Orpheus was Apollo's singer and prophet, sometimes his son; their hostility is a late invention." The art evidence, usefully enlarged by Cook, shows both that the motif of his head singing after death is older than our literary records and that there were parallel and perhaps derivative representations which do not refer to Or- pheus;32 it does not support the idea that the Philostratean tale is the point de depart.

XVIII as a consultation of the head of Orpheus, but Cook (p. xx) wisely adds a query. The head is bearded, like two mentioned in Furtwangler, III, 245 (and C. H. Smith and C. A. Hutton, Cat. Wyndham Cook Collection, p. 34, No. 144, P1. VII: head, on altar, consulted by Eros) and can hardly be Orpheus (the slight down on the singer's face in Roscher, op. cit., Vol. III, col. 1179, Fig. 4, is no adequate indication to the contrary); nor can the grotesque head in J. D. Beazley, Lewes House Collection of Ancient Gems, pp. 72 f., unless conceivably as a parody. Cf. Cook, p. 441, n. 6, for a wholly independent type relating to a legend of the foundation of the Capitol. For another gem showing consultation cf. G. M. A. Richter, Cat. En- graved Gems in Classical Style, pp. 72 f. 83 The Christian legend misunderstands the epithet Fulminata somewhat as Justin Martyr did Semo Sancus. 4 Cook (p. 351, n. 4) refers to a lekythos published by R. Hackl, Arch. f. Rel., XII (1909), 195 if., and interpreted by him as a scene of funerary homage be- fore a mummy. This does not seem possible (cf. C. H. Haspels, Attic Black-figured Lekythoi, p. 68); it may be some local variant of Dionysiac worship; in any event, the piece calls for further study.</page><page sequence="6">56 BOOK REVIEWS saph is now established (cf.

Cook's high courage, "breast and back as either should be," is of the order of his learn- ing. After these three volumes, I ask for more; will he not give us further collections?
