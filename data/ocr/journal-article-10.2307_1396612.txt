<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yehoyada Amir THE PERPLEXITY OF OUR TIME: RABBI NACHMAN KROCHMAL AND MODERN JEWISH EXISTENCE Any attempt to explore the Guide of the Perplexed of the Time (Moreh Nevukhei ha-Zeman)' by Nachman Krochmal (1785-1840) should start with the question: How can one ascertain the main objective of the various parallel discussions in the treatise? Many factors account for the difficulty in confronting that issue. First, we do not have an ade- quate knowledge of the exact structure that Krochmal wished to give to his book because it was never completed. We know very little about the content that he wished to assign the chapters that he had intended to write.2 Second, the only other texts that we have from Krochmal are some letters of his, in which he very seldom mentions the book and its objective. In fact, the only informative source we do possess is an 1836 letter to Shmuel David Luzzatto delivered by Krochmal's son Abraham. In this letter, Krochmal urges Luzzatto, with whom he had had no previous contact, to read and comment on several chapters of the manuscript on which he was working.3 Moreover, Krochmal deliberately does not provide the reader with definitions of his objective or principal views. For example, unlike Mai- monides's The Guide of the Perplexed, Krochmal's treatise does not begin with a systematic introduction that could give the reader a starting point from where he or she could examine the issue. Although both the short introduction at the beginning of the Perplexed of the Time and the subsequent "general prologue" combined with the first four chap- ters do provide considerable relevant information, which is discussed in detail below, one cannot discern any clear-cut definition of the book's objective.4 The treatise combines numerous discussions of di- verse fields such as the historiography of the Jewish people, biblical criticism, a study of the basic elements of halakhic and aggadaic litera- ture, and an analysis of the works of Jewish philosophers from various periods, as well as Krochmal's own philosophical discussions. Neverthe- less, Krochmal never discusses explicitly what connects all those themes and makes them a whole, and he does not reveal the book's internal DOI: 10.1093/mj/kjg019 Modern Judaism 23(3), ?

The reader is left to explore this open question on his or her own. I discuss several of the book's educational aspects below. However, at this point I should note that the above-mentioned state of affairs is not incidental but, rather, a direct result of Krochmal's educational philosophy. Reading the book is meant to be, in and of itself, an educa- tional process that provides the reader-learner with both a broad picture of theoretical-namely, philosophical, historiographic, and tex- tual-issues and, at the same time, a higher level of philosophic capaci- ties altogether. The philosophic horizons and capacities of the general reader simply could allow him or her to understand the real Fragestel- lung of the book and to appreciate it. Only through the educational process of reading and digesting the various discussions will he or she gain the capacity to realize the full range of the questions the book wishes to confront. Stating explicitly the final objective of the book before this educational process has been successfully completed would impair it and stifle its attainment. Only a reader who follows the book's path, occasionally reaching the various peaks that Krochmal attained, will comprehend, at the end of the process, the full significance of the path and the role played by each phase. Though understanding Krochmal's individual discussions does not seem to be a very difficult and complex task, scholars who study this book are radically divided on the issue of the book's general objective. Simon Rawidowicz states that Krochmal's main objective is an under- standing of the nature and essence of the Jewish people in order to mold the present.5 Rotenstreich vehemently asserts that "Krochmal's main problem lies in establishing Judaism's absolute value."' Jay Harris, however, proposes that Krochmal's objective is a "reaction to particular philosophical and historiographical approaches that seek to deny legiti- macy to rabbinic Judaism. In essence, he countered the triumphalism of modern, largely Protestant, self-judgment, which saw itself at the pinnacle of human achievement, and perhaps, even the culmination of world history, with an equally triumphalist Jewish self-evaluation that sought to shatter this self-serving construct."7 In contrast to the above, Eliezer Schweid views Krochmal as "first of all a historiographer and a critical scientific scholar of the history of the Jewish people" and only secondarily as a "scholar-philologist" and "original idealistic philoso- pher."' According to Schweid, the Perplexed of the Time is, in a sense, the essence and sum of Jewish culture in the way it is embodied in its sources.... [T]he intention was that anyone who studies the book after proper preparation in Jewish studies on the one hand, and in humanistic stud- ies on the other (the book also gives instructions on this matter), could fully enter the continuously evolving world of Judaism. He could be integrated in</page><page sequence="3">266 Yehoyada Amir the process of its acceptance, creation and transmission. One can say that... the Guide of the Perplexed of the Time was created as a teaching (torah) in the traditional sense of the word.' Ehud Luz emphasizes Krochmal's struggle with the "dangers re- flected by modern historicism for Jewish self-consciousness."''1 He as- serts that such a danger is the basis for all of Krochmal's philosophical endeavors. Some of those views seem to be quite arbitrary." Neverthe- less, the very existence of such a broad spectrum of interpretation em- phasizes the need to develop more precise tools of analysis through which one can define the treatise's purpose, inner hierarchy, and struc- ture. The information contained in the above-mentioned letter ad- dressed to the Italian maskil, Shmuel David Luzzatto, who Krochmal hoped would be a close ally, could well serve as a basis for such an analysis.12 It is in this letter that for the one and only time in Kroch- mal's writings the book's objective is defined. Krochmal, appealing to his supposed colleague and ally-to-be and urging him to read and com- ment on some of the chapters he already had composed, provides him with a comprehensive perspective of the book in progress. Through the very formulation of his request he also defines his view of Luzzatto, on the one hand, and of the expected audience for his book, on the other. Krochmal, of course, did not view Luzzatto as a representative of the broad and heterogeneous potential audience for his book at all but, rather, as a scholar who might share Krochmal's point of view. It is that perception of Luzzatto that enabled Krochmal to explain to him the book's general objective, its relation to Maimonides's The Guide of the Perplexed, and the obstacles he encountered in composing it. Be- cause of its contents the letter is crucial to the scholarly analysis of the book. THE PERPLEXITY AND ITS DEFINITION: FROM MAIMONIDES TO KROCHMAL The close relationship between the Perplexed of the Time and The Guide of the Perplexed is evident throughout Krochmal's work.." Nevertheless, each of the writers defines the perplexity he wished to confront differ- ently and each develops his own unique way of dealing with it. In order to examine the delicate relationships between these two definitions of perplexity we should look closely at Krochmal's formulation in his let- ter to Luzzatto: I saw fit to inform your honor that I desire to raise my voice at this late part in my lifetime and bequeath a legacy..,. in an essay on the wisdom of religion, which will include chapters dealing with pure faith, which are the most essen-</page><page sequence="4">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 267 tial issues for us. The Book will follow the Ray in his book Guide of the Per- plexed-if I am permitted and able to compare from afar. But there are some differences in their order, as behooves the perplexity of our times.14 The topic of the book that he was laboring over and that he wished to "bequeath" was, according to Krochmal's own testimony, "the wis- dom of religion" (Mii n=nM). We do not need to delve into the exact meaning of this term here. For our purpose it will be sufficient to point out that in another letter Krochmal identifies this subject-termed there "the realm of Jewish wisdom of pure faith"-with the Maimoni- dean notion of the "Torah's wisdom of truth," the kabbalistic notion of the "secret of unifying [the various manifestations of God] and faith," and the entire realm of the "philosophy of religion."15 Krochmal tells Luzzatto that "the wisdom of religion" should be elucidated in a manner similar to the way in which Maimonides had dealt with it. In other words, like the author of The Guide of the Per- plexed, Krochmal also discerns a basic perplexity that constrains the believing Jew and endangers his or her faith. Like Maimnonides, he also wishes to resolve and overcome this perplexity in order to strengthen and purify peoples' faith and remove all constraints. However, it is at precisely this point that the fundamental difference between the mod- ern and the medieval philosophers emerges. The "perplexity of the time that we are living in" that Krochmal wishes to confront is far from being identical to what Maimonides had encountered. In his opinion, this determines "the issues" that the book examines as well as the way in which they are "arranged." This difference bares an essential impli- cation of the way the reader of these books should read them and the tools he or she must develop in order to fully comprehend them. The Maimonidean definition of perplexity is well known. The pref- ace to The Guide of the Perplexed clearly delineates the book's purpose: [The purpose of this treatise] is to give indications to a religious man for whom the validity of our Law has become established in his soul and has become actual in his belief-such a man being perfect in his religion and character, and having studied the sciences of the philosophers and come to know what they signify. The human intellect having drawn him on and led him to dwell within its province, he must have felt distressed by the externals of the Law. ... Hence he would remain in a state of perplexity and confusion as to whether he should follow his intellect, renounce what he knew concerning the terms [that appear in the Law] in question, and consequently consider that he has renounced the foundations of the Law. Or he should hold fast to his understanding of these terms and not let himself be drawn on together with his intellect, rather turning his back on it and moving away from it, while at the same time perceiving that he had brought loss to himself and harm to his religion. He would be left with those imaginary beliefs to which he owes his fear and difficulties and would not cease to suffer from heartache and great perplexity.16</page><page sequence="5">268 Yehoyada Amir Only one who has intensively studied philosophy and science, on the one hand, and Talmud and Torah, on the other, will encounter such a perplexity, which is caused by the contradiction between the plain meaning of the anthropomorphic expressions in the Torah and the pure abstract conception of the Divine that philosophy dictates. This contradiction might lead that person to the horrifying notion that he or she must chose between these two realms of truth and authority and abandon one of them altogether. Certainly, it is only this kind of individual who will be perplexed. The traditional Jewish scholar, who did not study philosophy or exam- ine metaphysical questions, was not apt to experience any such perplex- ity. Either he would accept the biblical descriptions as the absolute truth or he would follow various traditional biblical commentators. The issues that emanated from a philosophical-rational study would not bother him in the least. Likewise, a traditional student of philosophy who had no real allegiance to the Torah would not be bothered by the apparent contradiction between his studies and the biblical text. Only the individual who confronts the rational demands of philosophy with that of traditional Talmud-Torah will feel perplexed. Maimonides's work is intended therefore only for people who have experienced such an awakening. In Maimonides's opinion, the perplexed person has reached a much higher level than one who has not attained such a state. More- over, Maimonides believes that the Torah's aim is to bring a certain degree of "welfare of the soul" even to the masses to a certain extent of "welfare of the soul," namely, to furnish them with a higher level of understanding of the truth in line with their limited capacity.17 Maimonides himself tries to implement this conception in his other writings, such as the Mishneh Torah and other popular essays.'s Never- theless, this objective does not apply to The Guide of the Perplexed. Mai- monides is not interested in addressing those who have not attained a degree of perplexity in this treatise. It is well known that he tried to prevent such a reader from actually understanding the book's discus- sions. Maimonides only addresses himself to one who is suited to read such a book and requires a Guide of the Perplexed. The definition of perplexity thus determines for whom the treatise is intended, and, to a great extent, it also determines its esoteric nature. As far as the methodological issue is concerned, we can follow Maimon- ides's explicit statements at the beginning of his Guide of the Perplexed wherein he explains that he has integrated two main opposing inter- ests. On the one hand, as befits a guide, he is aware of the didactic need to gradually elucidate his philosophical method. The treatise must integrate these discussions so that the reader will be able to con- front the difficulties inherent in comprehending the complex nature</page><page sequence="6">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 269 of the subject matter. Nevertheless, Maimonides wishes to prevent an unsuitable reader from understanding the book's objectives in order to preserve the treatise's esoteric nature. He consequently uses, as he explicitly states in the preface of the book, several methods of encoding so that only an eligible reader will be able to understand the discus- sions: "If you wish to grasp the totality of what this Treatise contains, so that nothing of it will escape you, then you must connect its chapters one with another; and when reading a given chapter, your intention must be not only to understand the totality of the subject of that chap- ter, but also to grasp each word that occurs in it in the course of the speech, even if that word does not belong to the intention of the chap- ter."19 Only deciphering the code, integrating the various discussions, identifying the essential, and separating it from the insignificant can enable the reader to confront Maimonides's full intent. Only the per- son who is capable of such an effort is the reader Maimonides wishes to invite to be guided by his book. Krochmal relates to the above-mentioned guidelines of Maimon- ides at the end of the book's general prologue, which is primarily de- voted to a definition of "the perplexity of the time" and his response to it: "And when you shall succeed in comprehending all the chapters [of the book] and you shall connect them one with another as the Rav has urged in the introduction to his Guide, then you shall understand the entire meaning."20 The close relationship between the two philo- sophical-educational books is evident. Nevertheless, it should be em- phasized that the reference to Maimonides and the link between a cor- rect reading of the Perplexed of the Time and The Guide of the Perplexed do not indicate that both books were written in an identical fashion. Hence, their reading may be different.21 At first glance, Krochmal's definition of perplexity appears to be precisely parallel to that of Maimonides. In the introduction to the Perplexed of the Time, Krochmal describes the two opposing factions within the contemporary Jewish community; both "lack proper faith"- the ultra-Orthodox, on the one hand, and the extreme maskilim, on the other. Both parties have the common tendency "to think that Torah faith is just what they had been educated in their youth to think."22 Both tend to define Jewish religious faith according to commonly ac- cepted opinions and through the plain meaning of scriptural texts and tradition, without investigation, criticism, or a willingness to be en- gaged in conceptualizing faith. When "Torah faith" is understood in such a poorly developed and imprecise manner, it surely seems to be directly contradictory to the teachings of science, philosophy, and history. Similar to what we have encountered in The Guide of the Perplexed, such a situation is perceived as demanding a choice between adhering to the haskalah and philoso-</page><page sequence="7">270 Yehoyada Amir phy and abandoning the Torah altogether, and adhering to the Torah and rejecting philosophic-scientific wisdom. It is also evident that Krochmal, like Maimonides, believes that such a decision is fully unnec- essary once we correctly understand "Torah faith"--in other words, once we elevate it to the level of the "wisdom of religion." Both guides devote much effort to exploring faith's content and clarifying its theo- retical significance in order to prove that the alleged contradiction be- tween faith and philosophical-scientific knowledge is only imaginary. An allegiance to scientific knowledge does not contradict loyalty to the Torah; in fact, it complements it and awards it its true significance. Only the acceptance of Torah and faith, on the one hand, and culture, philosophy, history, and science, on the other, as complementary valid authorities can engender a complete and true perception of both do- mains. Only then can one attain "pure faith" that is free of idolatrous characteristics. The similarity between Krochmal and Maimonides seems clear. But a closer look will also reveal the principal difference between the two. Whereas Maimonides's introduction describes the schism and per- plexity as taking place in his disciple's soul, Krochmal describes a fierce struggle between two factions of the Jewish public, neither of which perceives the choice between the Torah and enlightenment as arousing any kind of perplexity. On the contrary, the extreme maskilim "will rejoice because they have come across an opportunity to cast doubt and suspicion on that faith." In other words, they will gladly undermine the fundamental content of religious faith. On the other hand, the ultra-Orthodox "will toil and strive to strengthen and support" what they believe is Torah faith "with delusions and various exaggerations" and will view anything that the haskalah proposes as heretical and a threat to faith itself.23 This contrast between Maimonides's description of the torn soul of a believing maskil and Krochmal's depiction of the two opposing factions is not coincidental. Whereas Maimonides speaks of the per- plexity's essence, Krochmal warns that large sectors of the Jewish peo- ple are not confronting it. Moreover, in his opinion the real source of this perplexity lies elsewhere. Three of the four chapters of the general prologue of Perplexed of the Time are devoted to a discussion of the real source of the perplexity. Krochmal wishes to dissociate himself unequivocally from Maimoni- des's definition of perplexity as well as from the traditional mental con- ception of fundamental esotericism, which should be applied to the various types of metaphysical study. In particular, he wishes to refute the possibility that rabbinical circles would conclude that metaphysical study has a "dangerous" and esoteric nature, either in its kabbalistic- mystical manifestation or in its rational-philosophical variation. He</page><page sequence="8">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 271 wishes to confront the argument that the believer should not expose him- or herself to "modes of interpretation that even those who pro- mote them admit that they convey enormous dangers; it is better for us to receive the beliefs and terms of the Torah like the masses and infants, without even budging one step from them."24 Krochmal felt that both Maimonides and the kabbalists unnecessarily provide their antagonists with ammunition by emphasizing that only one who is "wise and knowledgeable" is permitted to set foot within their teach- ing's domain.25 Krochmal attempts to develop a different educational and ideological strategy for this issue. The first chapter of Perplexed of the Time confronts this anticontem- plative view, primarily in an indirect manner. Here Krochmal analyzes a series of religious aberrations that can threaten true monotheistic faith. Some of these aberrations may verge on actual idolatry, whereas others might cause a complete rejection of faith, religious tradition, and halakhah. Throughout the chapter, Krochmal attempts to prove, either directly or indirectly, that at the root of all these aberrations lie prob- lematic psychological structures, as well as educational and social short- comings. The terms employed in the chapter are all taken from the realm of psychology, history, and sociology. Krochmal deliberately does not analyze the very content of faith or the errant views under discussion. It is important to note that though it is clear that he sharply opposes the content of theses views, he never presents the very pursuit of con- templation as the direct cause of an aberration. Such a pursuit is con- sidered to be legitimate as long as it does not entail any practical im- proper consequences. The aberration delineated in the first paragraph is termed an over- rapture (Schwiirmerei). It is characterized by an extremely mystical and fervent personality that believes itself to have the capacity of annulling "the natural laws of Creation [Menuhat Ma'ase Bereshit]."26 Such a per- sonality stands in constant danger of perceiving itself as "an illusionary god." The second paragraph depicts a religious individual who is en- gulfed by an awareness of his or her many faults and sins. Such a per- son is therefore inclined to magical occupations that are supposed to cure but actually border on polytheism. Krochmal terms this aberra- tion a superstition (Aberglaube). A careful examination of these paragraphs shows that in both de- scriptions Krochmal is careful not to dispute the mystical beliefs or the theoretical content on which they are based, though he clearly views them as incorrect and flawed. Rather, his discussion has a different emphasis. He believes that the first aberration is characteristic of per- sons with a strong desire (17') who are inclined toward spiritualism, especially those who have not embraced the discipline of ethics, which attempts to strengthen a person's "reverence, humility and other</page><page sequence="9">272 Yehoyada Amir praiseworthy characteristics." Likewise, the worthless pursuit of magic is described as likely to appear among the "masses who are feeble- minded and have a strong imagination.""27 In both cases, the source of the aberration is a defective sociopsychological structure and the lack of a correct education-not the very pursuit of supposedly dangerous mystical teachings. Krochmal's view is fully realized and implemented in the third paragraph. The repudiation of metaphysics, which can be perceived as a reaction to the above-mentioned aberrations, is also described as inherently dangerous and as leading in its most extreme form to idol worship. Because of a misunderstanding of the real essence and causes of these aberrations, "persons of the lowest rank and the most superfi- cial Torah-scholars" tend to attribute a danger to the very exploration of metaphysics. Consequently, they tend to limit the believer to a study of halakhah and Talmud alone. This is a twofold error. First, they are unacquainted with the psychosociological and educational roots of the aberrations. Second, they are unaware of the significance of the fact that a human being possesses a spiritual potential that he or she has the desire to realize and which necessarily refuses any attempt to limit it to a solely formal religious act. The religious universe of those who tend to limit their religiosity solely to the halakhic dimension is there- fore completely distorted. They achieve the ignominious level of Werk- heiligkeit, that is, the sanctification of the technical act of fulfilling the ritual commandments and the inability to develop a spiritual theoreti- cal awareness. They relinquish all the other religious dimensions of life such as opinions, beliefs, and moral commandments. They even reject the idea that a believer should have an inner awareness of the theoreti- cal significance of fulfilling the commandments, an awareness that is essentially the "commandment's soul." The aberrations discussed in the final paragraph of this chapter- materialism, extreme skepticism, and the denigration of practical com- mandments-are all characteristic of the opposite camp of the extreme maskilim. They are derived, according to Krochmal, in a dialectic fash- ion from the first three aberrations and constitute an indubitable anti- thetic phenomenon of the perversions that abound in the haredi world. Therefore, it is clear to Krochmal that just as the engagement in mysti- cism and philosophy does not constitute a source of danger in one camp, the actual encounter with modernity and the general (secular) culture cannot constitute an explanation of perversions that spread in the opposite camp.28 The explanation must be sought, as in the previ- ous instances, on an entirely different level, which Krochmal wishes to describe in the subsequent chapters of his introduction. Contrary to the indirect confrontation in its first chapter, the trea- tise's second and third chapters are devoted to a direct confrontation</page><page sequence="10">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 273 with the view that construes the metaphysical study of "the wisdom of the Torah" to be the source of the perplexity and the religious aberra- tion. Krochmal devotes much effort to convince the reader that the dangers and obstacles that await the believer are immanent to the hu- man condition, on the one hand, and to Jewish faith, on the other, and are not aroused by the desire for philosophical or kabbalistic study. Because of the spiritual nature of the human being, the believers might be confronted by various dangers of different sorts that may cause them to fall into the trap of superstitious and false beliefs or the total abandonment of faith. The only way that believers can save themselves from the dangers that await them each day is through a careful, meth- odological conceptualization of the contents of faith, a study of the foundations of metaphysics, and a deep encounter with the "wisdom of Torah." Krochmal develops this argument on two levels. In the second chapter, he presents a universal discussion of a theoretical-epistemolog- ical nature. He claims that every person on some level encounters es- sential questions, conceptualizations, and the production of thought processes. The most elementary human communication-utilizing vari- ous types of proper nouns-expresses the fact that every person is a being who has creative spiritual power, and it is living proof that this force is constantly active within us all. Not only the scholar or the phi- losopher but every person conceptualizes, categorizes, and makes ab- stractions at an escalating level, even if he or she is not cognizant of it. It is a universal act, and it is manifest in all aspects of one's life. The difference between the philosopher or scholar and the common person is to be traced to the level of conceptualization attained and in the degree to which it is done reflexively. Most people are satisfied with various levels of detached images (Vorstellungen), which do not inte- grate into a clear, comprehensive conceptual system. This is, for exam- ple, the case regarding the common understanding of fundamental is- sues of faith such as Creation, Revelation, Prophecy, and so forth. Although Krochmal does not explicitly explain the full significance of the discussion's conclusions, nevertheless, it is easily clarified. By his or her nature every person must deal with spiritual questions. It is not the various manifestations of mysticism or science and philosophy that challenge a person with the fundamental issues of metaphysical knowl- edge and faith. On the contrary, such questions confront us as human beings regardless of our cultural context or level of education. In fact, precisely avoiding a critical methodological spiritual pursuit causes us to hold onto misconceptions as well as to adhere to heretical notions. If spiritual nonconceptualized images are left isolated, vague, and dis- connected from each other, then a person may distort and twist their meaning, without discerning any possible internal contradictions. Only</page><page sequence="11">274 Yehoyada Amir the attempt to reflectively pursue thought processes and comprehend faith's significance and content can rescue the believer from such a danger. "Pure faith" and the pursuit of the "wisdom of religion" are therefore not dangerous luxuries that most people should avoid-they are an existential necessity for anyone who wishes to live a proper reli- gious life. In the third chapter, Krochmal tackles the same problem from the particular perspective ofJewish religious culture. He attempts to prove the same position based on the irrefutable basic texts of traditional religious studies such as the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash. Halakhic religious studies deal essentially with conceptualizations, theoretical clarifications, and hypothetical examples and situations described by the biblical and Mishnaic texts. The Jewish scholar must develop his or her spiritual, conceptual, and intellectual potential. Any attempt to limit this power solely to the realm of halakhah, without allowing the student to delve into issues connected to faith and belief, is completely artificial and unproductive. A close study of these texts will easily reveal that they do not avoid the basic issues of metaphysics and theology at all and that they are often concerned with the various issues that are at the essence of the "wisdom of Torah." One who studies Jewish texts cannot avoid those issues and cannot refrain from encountering nu- merous questions for which rabbinic texts do not provide any clear-cut answers, as well as theoretical statements of this nature, which contra- dict each other. Any attempt to prevent the student from dealing with these issues in a critical and systematic manner will leave him or her helpless when faced with these open questions and the contradictions in the Bible and in rabbinic literature. Such a student will lack the ability to develop the necessary tools to successfully and genuinely con- front these questions and contradictions. The conclusion is clear both on the universal human level and on the particular Jewish one: there is no inherent danger in the study of metaphysical-philosophical texts or the Kabbalah. On the contrary, the only hazard is the artificial tendency to avoid such an examination and to naively accept the fundamental concept of "Torah faith." Contrary to Maimonides, Krochmal does not view the perplexity as a product of the encounter between the different realms of faith, which principally could be eschewed. The danger lurks for any believer, and the confron- tation with it is a necessity for every human being. Philosophy must therefore be the legacy of every learned believer and not solely of an esoteric group. It is clear that a guide written in light of this perspective will be fundamentally different from the guide that Maimonides composed. Moreover, the difference between the perplexity of Maimonides's disci- ple and that of Krochmal's goes far beyond this point. The two books</page><page sequence="12">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 275 exhibit a fundamental difference in how each regards the role of per- plexity. They differ in their definitions of perplexity and its social and religious role, in their structures and styles, and in the audiences they address. I have already observed how Maimonides directly ascertained such matters. Based on his definition of perplexity, he determines the select and limited audience that he wishes to address, the unique eso- teric style of writing, and his recommendations to the reader with re- gard to the art of proper reading. Matters are entirely different in Krochmal's case. Krochmal's letter to Luzzatto serves as the starting point for our investigation. Krochmal substantiated this request with the statement that Luzzatto was one of "the exceptional people" among those "pru- dent maskilim who are observant and rational" at the same time, with whom he could most naturally develop a dialogue.29 Krochmal thus defined the close circle, those with whom he could develop an open dialogue, namely, the moderate maskilim who integrate their philo- sophical, cultural, and scientific education with loyalty to the Torah and its precepts." To a certain extent, this reference group parallels the perplexed for whom Maimonides had written his treatise. Nevertheless, Krochmal's book was not written for such people. They are not his target audience. Luzzatto is asked to read the book's chapters before their publication and comment on them precisely because he does not represent the book's target audience. This is clearly and comprehen- sively defined in the following description of the difficulties Krochmal encountered while composing his treatise: Here at this late stage in history when we have already endured everything, and we have experienced all of the blessings and curses, both temporary and spiritual.., .it is very difficult to openly and publicly discuss such matters that affect-or at least seem to affect-the main principles of faith. It is much more so than in the case of Rav, of blessed memory... and therefore what decep- tion is there in speaking in one voice, which penetrates the heart and is under- stood by the Italian Jew and the Eastern Jew, which is heard by the Intellectuals of Germany and those of the Russian empire.31 Krochmal consequently wished to disseminate his statements among Jews with the most diametrically opposed religious-spiritual positions and views. He intended to write a book directed to the maskilim of the German-speaking countries and those of Italy, as well as to the ultra- Orthodox community in Poland and Russia. Unlike Maimonides, Krochmal openly asserts that he wished to write in such a manner so that his treatise could be read and understood by members of all the various Jewish factions.32 He therefore perceived his mission to be ex- ceptionally difficult because of the splits and diversity among the Jews of his time. This fact has far-reaching significance in many areas. Contrary to Maimonides's work, Krochmal's treatise does not primarily address</page><page sequence="13">276 Yehoyada Amir those who perceive themselves as perplexed to begin with. On the con- trary, Krochmal is well aware of the fact that the various groups "know each other and hate each other" and that both are overjoyed to choose between loyalty to the Torah or to science, modern culture, and philos- ophy.3 Krochmal asserts that each one of the opposing sides is con- vinced that all the woes of the world will be remedied if everyone only accepts its way. Perplexed of the Time cannot assume that its readers are perplexed. First of all, their perplexity must be aroused. In other words, the reader must be confronted with the spiritual crisis that he or she personally and the Jewish people at large face and consequently delve into the basic issue of the "wisdom of religion." I have noted that Maimonides could launch his discussions from this basic point of departure. Moreover, only those who have had such a legacy bestowed on them are worthy to study his guide. For Kroch- mal, however, arousing perplexity is in itself one of the many-faceted complex goals of the educational process that his book professes to promote. Only once the reader-disciple learns to become perplexed and achieves the understanding that a "Torah faith" that constantly nurtures itself on science and philosophy should be comprehended in a sophisticated manner can Krochmal truly begin to develop the discus- sion of "pure faith" in and of itself. This state of affairs determines much of the book's character. First, Krochmal does not intend to conceal philosophical and theological truths in the least; rather, he wishes to disclose their full significance and clarify them for anyone who is interested in understanding them. He does not want to reject the unworthy reader but, in fact, to address those who have not yet experienced the confrontation between Torah and philosophy or history. He wishes to encounter the reader-disciple wherever he or she is and gradually lead him or her from this point to a more sophisticated point of view that will provide him or her with both a much higher level of philosophical understanding and historic and textual knowledge. He therefore utilizes a wide range of didactic and rhetorical techniques. For example, Krochmal might painstakingly choose to induce interest through the choice of words a chain of tradi- tional associations. The biblical or traditional association can, at times, soften the radical message; other times, it might sharpen the message and, conversely, confront the reader with its complexity. In other places, Krochmal only gradually reveals his views and the full extent of the conclusions derived from them, and he tends to use allusions, whose meaning is clarified during the ongoing reading of the text. Nev- ertheless, because the book was never completed, the reader is left quite often with hints and allusions and has to try to conclude by him- or herself what Krochmal had meant to argue, had he been able to develop the discussion in full.</page><page sequence="14">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 277 In any case, these and other methods were all designed to serve the text's distinctive transformative objective. Every stage in the reading is supposed to affect three levels simultaneously. First, because the trea- tise does not direct its message to readers with an extensive philosophi- cal and scientific education, it must therefore gradually provide the reader with vast knowledge of the fields of history, the critical study of Jewish and other sources, the fundamentals of philosophy, and so on. Such knowledge is supposed to be the basis for heightening the con- sciousness of the perplexity and the confrontation with it. The second level derives from this body of knowledge. The very acquisition of knowledge and the confrontation with it are supposed to develop con- tinually expanding tools for systematic thinking and conceptualization in the reader and to gradually raise him or her from a limited-concep- tual, figurative mode of thought to that of totally abstract thinking. These two levels, namely, increasing the amount of knowledge and the development of advanced thinking tools, provide the basis for progress in the third principal level-the growth of the reader's spiritual capac- ity, her or his ability to confront the full significance of modern philo- sophical science and the way that it shapes an understanding of reli- gious tradition and the "fundamentals of religion." The reader-disciple's progress in reading the book means that he or she is developing all three levels. Connecting the chapters "with one another" means a continual reflective examination at every stage of reading the text of all that has been comprehended up until now.34 This examination will inevitably reveal the highest level of understand- ing and spiritual readiness that the reader-disciple has achieved. It will endow the material that was previously learned-and its conceptual level-with new significance. This significance, as it unfolds while one reads the text, is how Krochmal wishes to arouse "pure faith" and con- front the "perplexity of our times." THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS: CONFRONTING PERPLEXITY Though through this discussion we were able to analyze some aspects of Krochmal's understanding of perplexity and its role in constructing the Perplexed of the Time, the definition of the specific perplexity, identi- fied by him as typical to "our times," should still be clarified. The com- plexity of this issue comes from the fact that Krochmal does not, in any place in his writing, provide us explicitly with such a definition. Neither does he provide his reader with any methodological tools in order to differentiate between matters of major importance and those of minor import or between means and aims. The educational process that the reader undergoes when reading the text is meant of itself to</page><page sequence="15">278 Yehoyada Amir gradually engender both these distinctions and the definition of per- plexity. Only by reading the entire book and completing the spiritual- educational process that it entails can Krochmal's views and the signifi- cance of the various discussions in the book be fully revealed. When we attempt to confront this objective, it is essential to ex- plore which potential reader the Perplexed of the Time actually addresses. I have already noted that Krochmal perceived himself to be "the person in the middle"-one who observes the various factions of the Jewish people, examines their maladies and failures, and seeks to address the widest possible public from the opposing sides. Nevertheless, a precise analysis of the book definitely indicates that, in fact, it only addresses the society in which Krochmal lived and which he confronted-the tra- ditional East European community. This fact is easily discerned in nu- merous ways. The book's language is the first and most prominent clue. The decision to write a Jewish philosophical text in Hebrew is anything but self-evident. Indeed, the Jewish philosophical tradition on which Krochmal was nurtured is noted for its philosophical writings in foreign languages rather than in Hebrew. In this respect, Krochmal follows the philosophical biblical commentator Ibn Ezra, rather than Maimonides or Philo, whose writings he considered to be of great im- portance.35 Moreover, the linguistic issue has an additional facet. The use of the Hebrew language is in itself one of the most manifest didactic tools that Krochmal utilizes in his book. I have already described how Kroch- mal develops the use of traditional biblical or rabbinic language as a rhetorical and didactic means when he feels the need to assure the reader that the innovation proposed has a legitimate traditional foun- dation.36 Of course, such a rhetorical means only has significance for a traditional reader who is well versed in biblical and rabbinic sources. Only that kind of a reader will feel that the critical modernistic ap- proach is problematic and perhaps even dangerous, only in him or her will the traditional expressions arouse the associations and desired reactions, and only that reader will acquire a sense of security regard- ing the religious legitimacy of Krochmal's views. On the other hand, even if the Western maskil reader could read Hebrew, this methodol- ogy would only confuse, complicate, and alienate him or her from the text. A careful study of the various discussions found in the book gives an even stronger indication that it is definitely addressing the tradi- tional reader and trying to convince and educate him or her. For exam- ple, let us examine the above-mentioned discussion in the first chapter. It is no coincidence that Krochmal only gives a detailed description of the first three aberrations attributed to the ultra-Orthodox community. The three antithetical aberrations that characterize the radical maskilim</page><page sequence="16">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 279 are dealt with briefly and with no details, simply because they are not present in any religious personality that the reader would encounter in reality. Moreover, Krochmal does not need to convince the reader that these views represent an extreme and dangerous aberration. This seems to be self-evident for the potential reader no less than it is for Krochmal himself."7 Another clear example of how Krochmal directs his message to the traditional Jew is the discussion at the beginning of the book regarding the interpretation of Psalm 137-a psalm that describes and reacts to the Babylonian exile. Krochmal contests the traditional view of the Bi- ble that does not recognize the historical context of biblical texts gener- ally and which discounts this psalm's Sitz-im-Leben in particular. He claims that only a reading of the psalm within its true historical context will provide it with meaning and the ability to influence the reader- disciple by awakening meritorious religious and moral characteristics.38 Such a dispute is typical of one who exclusively addresses the tradi- tional Jew and not the maskil. The way the discussion is developed is completely irrelevant for one for whom biblical criticism is his or her bread and butter. Although Krochmal promotes a modern "enlight- ened" view here, nonetheless, he clearly addresses the "majority" who try to ignore modern science, research, and culture and who believe that they can save "Torah faith" by adhering to an unnecessary and useless fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.39 The educational process that the Perplexed of the Time should engen- der is designed to expose the traditional reader to modem culture, in addition to philosophy and science. The reader's loyalty to Jewish tradi- tion, halakhah, and basic precepts of faith is perceived as self-evident and as the starting point for the entire discussion. Krochmal does not need to develop any of the Vorstellungen of Jewish faith in the reader; rather, he must elevate the images that the reader already possesses to the highly conceptualized level of the ideas of the "wisdom of religion."40 This state of affairs is highly significant with regard to the issue presented at the beginning of this article-the general objective of Krochmal's discussions and the manner in which the various levels are integrated to serve the objective. The educational struggle conducted in the book concerns the legitimacy of developing a Jewish view that would embody the principal products of modern philosophical re- search, even if they had been spawned by a foreign culture.41 Krochmal definitely assumes that the reader has very little knowledge of the meta- physical, "historiosophical," and historiographical bases of philosophy and contemporary research, and he tries to introduce the reader to these fields. He certainly does not oppose these spheres, although he does not completely accept their contents without some criticism and adaptation. Like Maimonides in his time, Krochmal also requires aJew-</page><page sequence="17">280 Yehoyada Amir ish interpretation of the philosophy that he maintains. Moreover, like the author of The Guide of the Perplexed, he does not view the Judaizing of philosophical doctrines as his main objective. Rather, he desires to establish philosophical understanding as the focus for Jewish religi- osity. The principal objective of the educational process proposed by Krochmal in his treatise is the enhancement of "pure faith" and through it establishing the reader's ability to participate in the struggle for the renewal of Judaism in the modern era. This is how Krochmal himself clearly defines the treatise's theme in the above-mentioned letter to Luzzatto and in the treatise's general prologue.42 Textual and historical research does not serve as a goal in itself but, rather, as a valuable educational tool in order to arouse the reader's cognitive faculties and national-religious actions.43 Purification of faith, namely, raising it from a popular nonconceptualized level to that of a conceptual rational faith, is perceived as both deepening faith and establishing the basis for maintaining Judaism's renewal. Just as a historical understanding can give Jewish sources meaning, a rational study of these sources is not perceived to be merely a scientific act but, rather, part and parcel of Talmud-Torah in the full sense of the term. Even philosophical dis- cussion is not the main objective. It always directs one to those issues that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the essence of religion and the main concepts of faith.44 In the Perplexed of the Time, textual and historical research, as well as philosophical thought, are, as Guttman has stated, the "means for one goal, understanding Judaism's essence.45 In this matter, Krochmal is very close to the medieval archetype represented by Maimonides. The difference between them here is mainly anchored in their different relation toward the dimension of "time," namely, history, and its role in educating people, on the one hand, and to Judaism's foundation, on the other. JEWISH HISTORY AND MONOTHEISM: CONCERNING TIME AND ITS PERPLEXITY According to Maimonides, the study of history in and of itself is of very minor importance. History does not contain any aspect that would have made it a major axis for the education of a truly learned person.46 Also the level on which he deals with the issue of the correspondence between prophecy and the content of rational knowledge is totally non- historical.47 Krochmal takes a very different direction and emphasizes, again and again, that he wishes to discuss "the perplexity of our times."48</page><page sequence="18">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 281 This term apparently has a twofold meaning. On the one hand, it refers to the perplexity that characterizes his generation. It is derived from the nature of contemporary culture, Jewish society at that time, and nineteenth-century philosophy and research. However, it is diffi- cult to ignore the fact that this term has another, deeper meaning. Contrary to all that preceded it, the uniqueness of nineteenth-century culture, research, and philosophy is the new way in which the issue of history's place in the development of human consciousness and soci- ety's development is perceived. This constitutes a new kind of chal- lenge for reconciling Jewish faith with general culture and its investiga- tive and theoretical achievements.49 Krochmal does indeed devote extensive chapters of his treatise to studies in the field of history. These studies are devoted to two main issues. The first is a general "historiosophic" discussion concerning the significance and dynamics of the history of nations in general and the uniqueness of Jewish history. The second is a comprehensive historio- graphical survey of Jewish history from the time of Abraham until the Bar Kokhba revolt in the second century c.E., a survey that is clearly significant for the development of modern Jewish historiography. Krochmal's methodological and theoretical contribution to an under- standing of Jewish history, especially during the Second Temple pe- riod, unquestionably earns him a place among the founders of modern research on the subject of Jewish history. Only the fact that the book was never completed and its publication was delayed for eleven years after the author's death prevented Krochmal from having a more prac- tical influence on the beginnings of this academic field. Nonetheless, for our purposes the historiosophical discussion on which the historiographical research was based and which it was sup- posed to serve is of utmost importance. The structure of the history of nations that Krochmal briefly depicts in the treatise's seventh chapter should be examined in light of the introductory discussion in the sixth chapter. This is one of the book's principal chapters because it is de- voted to a series of basic questions regarding the essence of religion and Revelation.50 These questions should have definitely been widely and intensely discussed in the third part of the Perplexed of the Time, within the framework of the general discussion of the "wisdom of reli- gion."51 Krochmal's decision to introduce the main points at this stage shows that he viewed it as indispensable for an understanding of his- tory in general and of the Jewish nation's spirit in particular. The discussion of religion expresses Krochmal's metaphysical view, which combines Neoplatonic approaches attired in the guise of medi- eval thought along with Hegelian principles.52 According to his view of reality, there is continuity between the material and the various levels and types of the "partially spiritual" up until the "absolutely spiritual."</page><page sequence="19">282 Yehoyada Amir We can discern that which is partially spiritual by the fact that, despite the spiritual dimension that defines it, it is still connected to a certain extent to the material level. The partially spiritual phenomena conse- quently differ from each other both in the extent to which they are removed from the material and in the degree that they are released from its control, as well as in their nature and direction. All levels of the partially spiritual progress toward their pinnacle and consumma- tion within the exclusively unique absolutely spiritual. This complex picture is clarified when we contemplate people and human society as definitive representations of the partially spiritual. Every person has a spiritual dimension. Nonetheless, people clearly differ from one an- other according to the degree to which this dimension exists within them and controls the material dimension of their existence. More- over, each person's spiritual uniqueness is expressed by his or her char- acteristics, tendencies, and aptitudes. Based on this perspective, Krochmal could view religion as an ex- pression of a person's natural tendency for the spiritual. The differ- ences among religions only express people's disparate partially spiritual levels as well as the distinction of their direction and nature. In and of itself, there is nothing more natural than every person forming "some sort of spiritual structure" within his or her soul that expresses "the presence of the living spiritual essence that dwells" within him or her.53 An essential difference is apparent only between polytheistic religion and monotheism. Polytheism in its various forms represents the natu- ral desire of a human being to express his or her nature as a partially spiritual entity and to adhere to a certain level of such spirituality. Monotheism, on the contrary, is based on the consciousness that not only the material but also the partially spiritual is of absolutely no sig- nificance unless it is rooted in the absolutely spiritual and expresses it. This distinction between polytheistic religion and monotheism will form the basis for the discussions on Jewish history and its uniqueness in the following chapters. In a sense, monotheism embodies and ex- presses all the objectives of polytheism and elevates them to the level of the ultimate comprehensive synthesis.54 Just as the absolutely spiritual epitomizes all the levels and objectives of the partially spiritual, so does monotheism, that is, adherence to the absolutely spiritual, epitomize all the spiritual objectives that people may develop. Of further significance is the other aspect connected to monothe- ism's essence as a religious phenomenon. As previously stated, non- monotheistic religion represents a person's essence because the par- tially spiritual "is revealed within the human species to a great extent and enlightens their merits." On the other hand, monotheism's objec- tive is to elevate oneself beyond this spiritual essence. Monotheistic con- sciousness is grounded in the recognition that the partially spiritual,</page><page sequence="20">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 283 which is so characteristic of human existence, "is truly there as a being only due to God, may He be exalted, ... namely, the ultimate cause that encompasses in its uniqueness all causes and the true being of all that exists."55 Monotheism therefore expresses a person's attempt to surmount the limitations of his or her natural-spiritual existence and attain the absolutely spiritual that exists above and beyond him or her. Thus, monotheism integrates a human-cultural dimension, and it functions like any other religion, on the one hand, while it gives human existence a higher transcendental dimension, on the other hand. No doubt, Krochmal's comprehensive historiosophic outline, which he elaborates in the seventh chapter, is definitely based on views that were prevalent during his time.56 His main role is that of a "translator," providing the unschooled Hebrew reader with a synopsis of these views. Nevertheless, one should note that the way in which the discus- sion develops-which parallels the discussion on Jewish history and its uniqueness developed later-is based on this analysis of religion's status and its significance. According to Krochmal, the existence of nations and their history unequivocally expresses the spiritual dimension of human existence. A person can fully express this dimension only through a connection with other people and the creation of frameworks for sharing lives. Krochmal emphasizes that although to begin with the ties that connect the individuals of a nation may seem technical and utilitarian only, they are imprinted with the expression of the spiritual dimension, which is at the base of the existence and development of that community. It is actualized during the historical process until attaining its full political, cultural, and especially religious expression. Nations possess a certain characteristic of the partially spiritual as- pect, namely, the manifestation of people's basic spiritual level. Societal links that create a nation express a specific direction and level of spiri- tuality that is impure, and to a great extent it remains connected to the material and its qualities. It is therefore not surprising that just as the spiritual sustains and unifies a nation, the reason that eventually the nation will complete its para-organic life cycle and step down and disappear from the stage of history is the extent to which the spiritual clings to the material.57 After the "time of growth and development," when a nation begins to be unified and its unique nature begins to express itself, and "the time of the strength and the undertaking," when all of a nation's spiritual potentials are realized with all their force and might, the "time of melting and destruction" must also ar- rive-when a nation's disintegration will increase and eventually cause its disappearance from the stage of history. What is the significance of this concept for humanity as a whole? Clearly an idealistic philosopher such as Krochmal must have perceived</page><page sequence="21">284 Yehoyada Amir some universal comprehensive significance in the history of various nations, which is connected to humanity in general. Although he does not go into the complexity of this issue in a detailed and explicit man- ner, Krochmal does indicate his general outlook in a discussion of the apparent contradiction between the permanent existence of the spiri- tual and the disappearance of a nation that had exhibited it: Nevertheless, this does not contradict our basic notion that the spiritual is an infinite being, while it is not the spirit itself which will be terminated and abolished but rather its actual appearance which is rooted and dependent upon time and place, that is, its specific manifestation in a particular country and a specific generation. In this manner, that spirituality is also indubitably finite and ephemeral. However, that which is spiritual in essence will assuredly remain part and parcel of [the spiritual being of] another nation, which bor- ders upon it either in place or in time. It is true that in the case of a small nation the on-going existence of its spirituality after the destruction of the nation itself is almost unrecognizable, even though it will not, in fact, be com- pletely lost. In regard to a great nation-one that possesses many achievements and is recognized for its fine artistry, poetry, literature, and legal system-the situation is different. It bequeaths a legacy for all of humanity, and its general spirituality will be realized and emulated forever.5 When in the course of history a nation disappears, its cultural heri- tage is nevertheless not lost. Either perceptibly or inconspicuously it is transmitted to other nations that will continue to emerge after that nation has stepped off the stage of history. The partially spiritual thus achieves two qualities that it embodies. It is connected both to the worldly and to the uniquely national context-in other words, to the material. As such it is certainly ephemeral, like everything that is rooted in the material. On the other hand, the fact that one nation's spiritual undertaking is expressed within the framework of another nation's de- velopment means that it will endure throughout eternity for all of hu- manity. The partially spiritual that was manifested within a nation in a spe- cific time and context partially expresses humanity as a whole. There- fore, the idea of humanity that does not merely express the partially spiritual or the sum total of various nations' partially spiritual aspects signifies the absolutely spiritual. The various processes of world history, mainly the rise and fall of various nations and cultures, sustain humani- ty's timelessness and the perpetual craving for the absolutely spiritual. Krochmal's notion of Jewish history should be examined in light of this understanding. As I have noted, each nation represents one facet of humanity. Its religion expresses a certain dimension of the partially spiritual and is, on the one hand, perpetual and, on the other, ephemeral. Jewish monotheism, however, focuses on adhering to the absolutely spiritual alone. It strives to transcend the ordinary reality of human existence and to attain perfection, which can only be fully</page><page sequence="22">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 285 represented by humanity as a whole and as an idea. The religion of the Jewish people does not express one type of the diverse partially spiri- tual. Rather, it shows the general direction that human history is tak- ing. The Jewish people are consequently not transient, as are other nations. We have examined two unique characteristics of monotheism that are presently expressed by the structure of Jewish history. On the one hand, we must say that the "spiritual share" of the Jewish people has no distinctive character, as is the case with every other nation. The Jewish people's spiritual objective includes all of these spiritual aims and consummates them. It is therefore not surprising that the Jewish people are perceived by Krochmal as having the ability to learn from all the lofty spiritual objectives of other nations, rather than existing as a merely isolated entity. This is true both with regard to the dimension of material civilization as in the case of the sojourn in Egypt and for the dimension of the formation ofJewish "wisdom of religion" through European science and philosophy during Krochmal's own time. The second aspect of monotheism is the aspiration of its believer to surmount the partial spirituality that characterizes human beings from their very essence. Of course, this aspiration does not release the monotheistic believer from the conditions of human existence. How- ever, it does direct a person's entire life according to a regularity that transcends what usually rules a person's life. This regularity forms the foundation of Jewish history. On the one hand, this history can certainly not occur outside of the historical cycles of existence to which the same processes that dominate the history of other nations apply. On the other hand, this cannot be a temporary stage of humanity's existence-it must be everlasting. Jewish history therefore operates at the same para-organic tempo of life cycles as can be discerned in "the time of growth and development," "the time of the strength and the undertaking," and even "the time of melting and destruction" during which deterioration and disintegration occur. However, these life cycles do not represent temporary lives that are due to end but are, in fact, only one step on the path of eternal history. The Jewish people do not experience one life cycle but, rather, an ever- lasting series of life cycles. The stage of deterioration and disintegra- tion that caused every other nation to disappear from the stage of his- tory also symbolizes a most serious crisis in Jewish history. However, it did not cause a terminal or complete deterioration but, rather, the end of one specific life cycle. Sooner or later after this stage a new emer- gence commences and, with it, a new life cycle. Krochmal elucidates the significance of this schemne at the begin- ning of the eighth chapter, after summarizing his general historical outlook concerning other nations' life cycles:</page><page sequence="23">286 Yehoyada Amir On the one hand, our nation is also subject to the above-mentioned natural historical laws regarding the material dimension and the external earthly phe- nomena. Nevertheless, there is another essential dimension, to which the Rab- bis refer when they say: "when they were exiled to Babylon the Holy Presence accompanied them, when they were exiled to Elam and the Holy Presence accompanied them, etc." In other words, the general-spiritual that is embodied in our existence will defend and save us from the nature of mortality. And all of this is easily concluded from what was previously stated.59 Krochmal does not explain here how the external earthly dimen- sion of history, which determines the dynamics and the mortality of other nations, is in the Jewish case integrated into the general spiritual dimension that ensures eternity. He suffices with the statement that this integration "easily" results from what was stated in the previous chapters. This result apparently contains several layers, which we shall explore. As we have seen, the first dimension-a nation's very immortal- ity-is evident. Adherence to the absolutely spiritual gives the Jewish people the strength to overcome the crises that mark the end of the various cycles. The spiritual struggle for the Jewish people's recovery following the destruction of the First Temple, namely, the transition link between the first and second cycle, illustrates how the absolutely spiritual "defends" the nation and ensures its existence. The strength to continue and hope for the rebirth of the nation's life, and thereby continue its life, was in this case totally dependent on a monotheistic interpretation of Jewish history. The Jewish people continued to exist only because they did not view the gods of Babylon as having defeated the God of Israel, as a polytheistic believer would have interpreted the situation. Rather, they believed that the Lord of the universe had punished his sinning people and had directed history according to the parameters of the covenant between Him and Israel. It should be emphasized that in citing the rabbinic saying that the Holy Presence went into exile with the Jewish people, Krochmal does not propose that God directly and explicitly interferes in events-this would not coincide with his theological views.60 Under his interpreta- tion such a rabbinical statement is to be understood as suggesting that the very historical episodes reveal the way the Jewish people's unique spiritual dimension, rooted in Jewish monotheism, guides their his- tory.61 The second dimension, that which determines the internal dynam- ics of Jewish national life, is also not surprising. Except for their uniqueness in being a monotheistic nation, the Jewish people consti- tute only one of many nations. Clearly, it also must undergo the same historical processes that propel the history of all nations, even if in such a way that the result will de different at some decisive point. To be more precise, the significance of this basic character ofJewish his-</page><page sequence="24">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 287 tory exceeds the fact that the Jewish nation also fulfills life cycles and that eternity must overcome the crisis of disintegration and degenera- tion every time. As I have noted, every nation bequeaths some partially spiritual legacy to humanity that should provide for the overall and eternal building of the absolutely spiritual. If Jewish history integrates the national and universal dimension-the historical dynamics of para- organic life cycles and a metahistorical eternity-then we must assume the Jewish people's many life cycles should have a similar significance to that of other nations' life cycles with regard to humanity's formation. In other words, we should expect continuous progress from cycle to cycle within the Jewish monotheistic national reality, a progress that increasingly shapes the full significance of adherence to the absolutely spiritual. Krochmal's historiographic description of Jewish history, which only provides a detailed explanation of Jewish history during its first two life cycles, cannot directly confirm or disprove this expectation. Beyond this historical point, Krochmal only provides the reader with a very brief description of the frameworks of the third cycle, which ends in the seventeenth century, and no more than that. Krochmal explicitly discusses the progress that occurred between the first and second cycle. Jewish existence in the Second Temple period is described as being, in principle, higher than that in the First Temple period, in spite of the fact that it was marked by a decline in the political status of the Jewish people, similar to the end of the age of prophecy: And, although in some aspects, this new era is inferior to the First Temple period, now the nation has experienced the emergence ... of a great new spiri- tuality that has increased and become a spirit of wisdom and insight, a spirit of counsel and valor, a spirit of devotion and reverence for the Lord. Thus the spirit of wisdom and insight is to know the value of the precious virtue that they inherited from their forefathers as opposed to the vanities of the other nations to whose lands they have immigrated. The spirit of counsel and valor is to establish their community and appropriate and adorn it with the commandments of the Torah and the virtuous customs of their ancestors. And, when necessary, they were even willing to give up their lives in order to fulfill them because they were so dear to them. The spirit of devotion and reverence for the Lord is to collect, inscribe, and copy all that remains from the sacred scriptures and to contemplate and interpret them, clearly and rea- sonably.62 In accordance with the traditional convention, Krochmal states that during the First Temple period worship of God was "not free of idolatry or the struggle against idol worship."" Only after the Babylo- nian exile and the Return to Zion was faith firmly established for the entire Jewish people.64 Nevertheless, because the historiographic de- scription ceases with the end of this cycle, it seems to be difficult to reach an unequivocal conclusion concerning the question as to</page><page sequence="25">288 Yehoyada Amir whether this progress symbolizes the relation between each of the na- tion's life cycles and its predecessors or whether it is exceptional. This state of affairs has aroused a scholarly debate among Krochmal's inter- preters that has far-reaching consequences regarding the way in which Krochmal's entire endeavor is to be understood as well as his estima- tion of his generation's standing and his outlook concerning the role and mission of the Perplexed of the Time. In order to try and confront this question, we must examine the topic from a more comprehensive viewpoint."5 If we choose not to as- sume that there is progress from cycle to cycle, then Jewish history, which is guided by the absolutely spiritual, will be characterized by the lack of any meaning or direction. At the same time, humanity's entire history, as Krochmal interprets it, is a clearly significant process of progress, nurtured by the very same spiritual dimension. It could be argued that by their very nature no "process" and, even more so, no "progress" could conform to the absolutely spiritual because it repre- sents the apex of human consciousness.66 This contention, however, is unacceptable. It should be noted that the difference between the first and second cycle is rooted solely in monotheism's acceptance by the people in their totality. Krochmal describes it as connected directly to a basic change in monotheism's mode of expression. During the sec- ond cycle, rabbinical leadership and the development of Jewish reli- gious studies replaced prophecy. Instead of a superficial belief in "overt miracles," the dimension of Providence in Jewish history began to be understood as being based on "hidden miracles," that is, the way in which a spiritual force directs history according to a natural order.67 There is no reason to assume that such changes must cease at this stage and that further development cannot occur. Moreover, the assumption that monotheistic faith cannot advance contains a fundamental error. Belief in the absolutely spiritual is simply not identical to the metaphysical category and being of the absolutely spiritual itself. As a human phenomenon, it is subject to changes, devel- opments, and progress. The idea of progress provides the basis for the battle that Krochmal wages in his treatise. He postulates that one should not be satisfied solely with traditional halakhic studies and tries to introduce "the wisdom of religion" to the entire Jewish people, a wisdom that is essentially the legacy of the "third cycle" and the ensu- ing period. He fights for the purification of "Torah faith" based on the explicit assumption that monotheistic faith can appear in different forms and levels. Indeed, there is an inherently dialectic relation be- tween the monotheistic Vorstellungen and that of "pure faith." On the one hand, both surely express the same basic content and desire for the absolutely spiritual. On the other hand, there is a basic difference</page><page sequence="26">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 289 between the two. An increase in the degree of faith and its purification brings one closer to monotheistic truth. This progression toward the truth represents the essence of the Jewish people's unique history. Furthermore, if we now examine the relation between the second and third cycles on these two levels, then certainly the third cycle is inherently higher than the second one. According to Krochmal's brief description, Maimonides and Nachmanides, two of the most promi- nent figures in Krochmal's view of Jewish culture and religion, repre- sent the third cycle's apex of creativity." They exemplify not only tradi- tional Jewish learning, which is the legacy of the second cycle and whose sole focus is halakhic studies, but also, first and foremost, meta- physical study, which provides the basis for the "wisdom of religion."69 The apex of the third cycle, the Golden Age of the Jews in Muslim and Christian Spain, is also connected to the establishment of study and learning among wide sections of the Jewish people. It definitely sur- passes the pinnacle of the Hasmonean dynasty's prosperousness, which represented the apex of the second cycle.70 Jewish history is one of continual progress, paralleling humanity's history. Its life cycles not only symbolize the fact that, to a certain ex- tent, the Jewish people's eternal history is also that of any national group subject to the ordinary laws of historical development. It also indicates that each stage of monotheism's development is a step toward perfect "pure faith." Each of these stages bestows on the Jewish people a certain life force, although it will eventually reach its end and wither away. Jewish history's only uniqueness lies in its internal development. It is not a new, partially spiritual presence that arises on the stage of history with each life cycle of Jewish history but, rather, a new and deeper expression of the Jewish "spiritual share," namely, the abso- lutely spiritual. The degeneration, which here, as with every nation, represents the partially spiritual expression, should not destroy the na- tion but, in fact, only force it to struggle for physical survival and spiri- tual rebirth. SHOWING THE PATH The theme of Perplexed of the Time and its organizing principle are the stuff of this struggle. It is from this point of view that one should exam- ine the connection between the various discussions, their hierarchy, and their significance. Because history is of the essence here, we should begin our comprehensive examination with the historical discussion itself. As previously stated, Krochmal only gives a detailed description of the annals of the first two cycles. He briefly hints at the third cycle,</page><page sequence="27">290 Yehoyada Amir which ended around the middle of the seventeenth century. He says nothing about the ensuing period. What does the gap in his description of the various periods in Jewish history signify? One would assume that the brevity of the reference to the third cycle could be attributed to Krochmal's own limitations as a historiographer. According to such an explanation one should assume that because Krochmal was unable to delve into the complexity of this period, he therefore only gave a gen- eral outline. However, even if this rationale has some basis, it certainly cannot explain Krochmal's complete silence concerning the subse- quent history following the end of this cycle. This silence calls for a different and deeper explanation. It is easy to prove that Krochmal viewed his generation as being on the verge of the fourth cycle ofJewish history.71 The general cyclical structure of Jewish history requires that sooner or later after the end of the third cycle the next cycle will commence. The huge gap in time between the middle of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century parallels the "the longer time spans" through- out the third cycle itself. The way in which Krochmal relates to events and spiritual movements during his era also indicates such a direction. On the one hand, he lives with the feeling that a serious crisis of disin- tegration, as well as severe perplexity, exists. On the other hand, he views his generation as "a generation of knowledge of the world," a generation in which the infirm of faith have reached such a level that it is clearly visible and can therefore be remedied.72 Krochmal often calls his contemporaries "the last generation," thereby arousing biblical associations of a generation that accepts and continues the tradition, one that is superior to its rebellious ancestors." This complex relation is summarized in the way in which he describes his generation in his letter to Luzzatto. I have quoted this passage, in which he refers to his time as "this late stage of history" or, literally: "this end of the days." On the one hand, he states that the prevailing views of his generation are very different and contradict one another. It is a generation of disintegration and polarity, as in the end of every cycle. However, when Krochmal states that today "we have experienced all of the blessings and curses, both temporary and spiritual," he is clearly referring to the following passage in the Torah:74 When all these things befall you-the blessing and the curse that I have set before you-and you take them to heart amidst the various nations to which the Lord your God has banished you, and you return to the Lord your God, and you and your children heed His command with all your heart and soul, just as I enjoin you this day, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and take you back in love. He will bring you together again from all the peo- ples where the Lord your God has scattered you.., and He will make you more prosperous and more numerous than your fathers. (Deut. 30:1-5)</page><page sequence="28">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 291 These verses obviously describe a spiritual revival following a crisis, a revival that according to Krochmal should be perceived only as the beginning of a renaissance that will engender a new cycle. This renais- sance is the essence of the fourth cycle that Krochmal predicted and struggled to create.75 If this is true, then why didn't Krochmal clarify the belief that his generation is on the verge of a fourth cycle? It seems to be that in spite of the great importance associated with the study of history-in terms of both specific historiographic knowledge and the general historio- sophic view concerning the course of Jewish history-Krochmal does not propose to teach his reader history for its own sake. The book's objective is to teach "the wisdom of religion"-an awareness for which the historical processes should lay a firm foundation."7 Krochmal pres- ents Jewish religious truth as the product of a religious universal cul- ture based on the human decision to impose the absolutely spiritual on one's life and the life of the entire Jewish people. An understanding of historical development confronts a person with his or her responsi- bility to continue to shape this culture." Setting out to study history only represents the first step along the educational path for the reader of Perplexed of the Time. It will lead to a more involved scholarly and theoretical examination of the main corpus of Jewish religious litera- ture and subsequently to the gist of the matter-the development of a religious-philosophical outlook. Krochmal is not interested in engaging in a theoretical-religious struggle solely on a historical premise. A historical momentum will not engender the hoped for revival; only the the theoretical-religious truth, on account of which this treatise was composed, can provide the neces- sary momentum. The historical description therefore does not con- tinue up until the time period of the reader, and Krochmal does not openly confront the reader with history's challenge. Just as the com- poser of Psalm 137 did not strive for the beginning of the second cycle but, rather, for faith in God and the belief in the continuity of Jewish existence, so too must the contemporary reader participate in the ef- fort to purify and establish faith. Post factum, the reader will undoubt- edly understand and sense that he or she is on the verge of a modern Jewish renaissance. Perplexed of the Time aspires to play a central role in shaping this renaissance, which has far-reaching significance beyond the historical dimension that it acquires. It struggles to continue to develop, elevate, and purify Jewish faith so that it will contribute to humanity's religious formation and direct it to a realization of its essence, that is, imposing the absolutely spiritual on our lives, moral decisions, and faith.

For example, Harris's position seems arbitrary. He is clearly correct that a significant proportion of "historiosophic" views, including Hegel's, are char- acterized by the Protestant Christian "triumphalism" that prevailed during the first half of the nineteenth century. Of course, Krochmal cannot agree with these views in regard to Christianity's superiority over Judaism. He therefore had to establish a historical perspective that makes Judaism the focus of hu- manity's progress. In this matter he concurs with many Jewish philosophers, many of whom preceded him, as well as with some who lived in his day. All these thinkers labored in order to explain philosophical as well as historical systems under the assumption thatJudaism is superior to both Christianity and Islam. Nevertheless, this does not make Krochmal's book a "reaction" to such triumphalism, and it does not justify viewing the defense of "rabbinic Juda- ism's" legitimacy as Krochmal's main goal. Both Krochmal and the potential reader have no doubts in this matter. 12. It is well known that Krochmal's expectations were disappointed-he discovered that Luzzatto's view was essentially different than his, especially with regard to philosophy's position within the spectrum of religious thought.</page><page sequence="30">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 293 Consequently his appraisal of Maimonides's and Ibn Ezra's philosophies was very negative. 13. Many factors indicate Krochmal's unique attitude to Maimonides. For example, he calls Maimonides "the Rav" while others are cited by their names. He often quotes Maimonides and uses his terminology. See Bernard Steinberg, "Nachman Krochmal, Herman Cohen and Maimonides' Influence on Twenti- eth Century Jewish Philosophy" (Ph.D. dissertation, Hebrew University, 1973 [Heb.]). 14. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 425. The adjective (emuna) tzerufa used here is apparently a translation of Kant's adjective rein, namely, "pure." This adjective plays an essential role in his "critiques." 15. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 436. One should note that Krochmal does employ such terms as terminus techniqum. The theme of his book's discus- sion is called the "wisdom of religion" in letter 11; however, in letter 13 it is called the "Jewish wisdom of pure faith," and, in the book itself, Krochmal usually calls it "the wisdom of faith" (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, pp. 30, 272). 16. Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, trans. Shlomo Pines (Chi- cago, 1963), pp. 5-6. 17. See Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, Vol. 2, chap. 40, pp. 383- 384 and Vol. 3, chap. 27, pp. 510-512. It should be noted that in comparison with Platonic political philosophy, Maimonides appears to be a clear adherent of the esoteric and aristocratic dimensions of the philosophical tradition that he inherited. Apparently, the religious nature of his views would not allow him to be satisfied with "the welfare of the body," namely, ensuring stability and righteousness within social life. Contrary to Plato, he is not willing to base this stability on a certain kind of legendary myth, which the lower classes will hold and which will provide them with a sense of meaning and orientation. Rather, he strives to enable every person to attain the greatest possible measure of true beliefs and knowledge, namely, a self-realization of his or her human potential. Maimonides is consequently willing to pay a very high price with regard to using parables and images by the prophets instead of conceptually accurate language. It should be noted that according to Maimonides a plain understand- ing of this picturesque language can even lead the believer to views that border on idol worship and pure anthropomorphism of God. See Jeffery Macy, "The Rule of Law and the Rule of Wisdom in Plato, al-Farai and Maimonides," in Studies in Islamic and Judaic Traditions, ed. W. M. Brinner and S. D.

This unique expression, Menuhat Ma'ase Bereshit, invented by Krochmal is unquestionably taken from Moses Mendelssohn's commentary (Be'ur) on the verse "On the seventh day God completed the work that He had been doing" (Gen. 2:2). Mendelssohn explains that the rest on the seventh day provides the constancy of the laws of nature. During the six days things were created accord- ing to the Creator's will; "however, the world had no rest or inactivity since it did not follow its custom, and matters did not follow the Creator's laws and regularity as regards evolutionary causality-which would be the rest in the Deed of Creation."

It should be noted that, to a great extent, this definition overlaps with Spinoza's portrayal of a prophet. Although Krochmal does not explicitly mention Spinoza here, he relates and responds to his views. In his opinion, such an individual does not represent a prophet but, rather, a certain dangerous type of mystical religious leader who can, nonetheless, aspire to possess prophetic abilities. 28. It is especially apparent with regard to the way in which the third anti- thetical aberration is described. Denigration of the practical commandments is not described-as could well be expected-in terms that could suggest the development of reform in Krochmal's time. Rather, they suggest heretical tendencies in the mystic's and philosopher's camp, for it is very difficult to apply to the reform thinkers, and especially to the their first generation, the claim that they "boast the advantage of knowing the meaning behind the com- mandments according to 'knowledge' or the 'undisclosed"' (p. 9), and that this is the main motivation for the changes they wish to implement in religious life. The reader should note here what Krochmal wrote in his letter against Luz- zatto, in which he defends himself against the allegation that the study of meta- physics leads to the weakening of devotion to the commandments. Although he does admit that "we do see a few students who take lightly the command- ments" (p. 435), he rejects the argument that this proves the connection be- tween the study of metaphysics and this derision. On the contrary, observing the different groups of antagonists to this sort of study over the generations will show that "in some periods, entire sects developed which took lightly the deeds and even the intellectual commandments." It is evident from this argu-</page><page sequence="32">Krochmal and the Modem Jewish Experience 295 ment, which is completely parallel to the position advocated in the first chap- ter, that Krochmal is referring to philosophers of past generations who deride the commandments. 29. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 326. 30. In Krochmal's own words: "[Those of us] who are in the middle and observe what is done and said on the right and left, should proclaim" (p. 425). 31. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 326. With Safa Ahat Udevarim Ahadim Krochmal alludes to Gen. 11:1, which describes humanity's unity prior to the Tower of Babel. Just as humanity became divided during this period, the Jew- ish people have almost lost both their unity and the ability to be addressed as one public. 32. We cannot accept Harris's contention that Krochmal directed his re- marks to people with Luzzatto's status (Nachman Krochmal, p. 21). Such people do not need the unique educational process that Krochmal develops in his book. 33. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 326. 34. See Schweid, "Bein 'Hokhmat Hatorah al Haemet' Ve'Sod Yikhud Hae- munah' La'filosofia shel Hadat,"' pp. 28-32. 35. Krochmal viewed Ibn Ezra as one of the most prominent Jewish philos- ophers of the Middle Ages. In his letter against Luzzatto, he terms him "the giant" and places him on the same level as Maimonides. He rhetorically asks: "Who is there that was moved by God's spirit to study Jewish wisdom who was not first nourished by the waters of the wisdom emanating from these two good fountains?" (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, pp. 440-441). Krochmal de- voted a very lengthily discussion to Ibn Ezra's teachings in Perplexed of the Time, which to a great extent shows in what areas Krochmal agreed with him. See Julius Guttman, "Yesodot hamah'shava shel Rabbi Nachman Krochmal,"' Knes- set, Vol. 6 (1941), pp. 259-286. Krochmal was also greatly influenced by Azariah di Rossi (1513-1578), the firstJew (since ancient times) who studied Philo's writings. In the wake of Men- delssohn, Krochmal terms him Yedidyah (a friend of God) (for example, see Hakdamato shel Mendelssohn Letargum Hatorah U'lebeiur Sefer Netivot Hashalem [Mendelssohn's Introduction to the Translation of the Torah and to the Commentary of the Book Netivot Hashalem], ed. Hertz Hamberg [Vienna, 1846], Vol. 1, pp. xxii-xxiii). Nevertheless, Krochmal's relation to Philo is much more involved than any previous Jewish writer's. Krochmal is the first Jewish philosopher and scholar to view Philo as one of the mainsprings of the Jewish "wisdom of reli- gion." It is entirely possible that the chapter that deals with this matter (chap. 12) should have been grouped next to the one that examines Ibn Ezra (chap. 17) and assigned to the third part of the book, dealing with "the wisdom of religion." Zunz, who edited the book, placed it together with the chapters deal- ing with the study of Jewish sources. In the letter against Luzzatto, Krochmal defines the Jewish Hellenists as those "who first established inner Jewish wis- dom through philosophical research" (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 434). 36. For example, see the use of traditional expressions in the first para- graph of the introduction, which is devoted to a critique of the traditional view that King David composed the entire Book of Psalms. One can detect at least seven clear-cut cases wherein biblical verses are employed; in some instances</page><page sequence="33">296 Yehoyada Amir the biblical association has great significance. Likewise, it includes a direct quote from the Metzudat David commentary on Psalms, based on the B. Talmud (Gittin 57b), and a play on words based on the first benediction before the Shema (of the morning and evening prayer). 37. Typical of this objective is the fact that, for example, Krochmal con- demns as "crazy" anyone who questions the historical authenticity of the exis- tence of "the faithful shepherd our teacher Moses and the giving of the Torah by him" (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 9). Moreover, both Krochmal and his potential readers do not require any detailed argumentation in order to refute this view because it is perceived as clearly contradicting common sense and truth. In this context, it is definitely convenient for Krochmal to be in the same camp as the potential reader. He thereby strengthens his legitimacy for such a reader. 38. I have developed this topic in my article "Al Naharot Babel-Rabbi Nachman Krochmal Umizmor 137," Tarbiz, Vol. 61, Nos. 3-4 (1992), pp. 527- 544. 39. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 6. 40. Of course, Krochmal does not concur with all that has been said and written regarding biblical criticism or contemporary philosophy, "historioso- phy," or historiography. Clearly, much of the material cited by Krochmal was transformed and adapted to the Jewish perspective. Nevertheless, he definitely does not view himself as one who must defend the Jewish faith from these or any other teachings, as suggested by some interpreters, but, rather, as one who wishes to expose the reader, who previously knew almost nothing about these matters, to their productive and current dimensions. 41. Krochmal also firmly defends the legitimacy of utilizing non-Jewish phil- osophical sources in his letter against Luzzatto (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, pp. 435-436). 42. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 425. 43. Typical of this objective is the way that Krochmal develops the discus- sion in the first paragraph of the introduction, mentioned above. Factual truth is not the main motive here for nullifying the traditional nonhistorical view- the argumentation is dictated by an educational-spiritual concern. 44. See, for example, the discussion in chap. 4 on the issue of the Aristote- lian ethical view of the middle path. Krochmal's main theme is the establish- ment of a basis for the discussion of a synthetic middle path pertaining to faith and religion. With the same objective in mind, Krochmal terms chap. 16, which was supposed to introduce the religious-philosophical part of the treatise, "defi- nitions and introductory assumptions on the wisdom of faith derived from logical philosophy." He clearly states there that " wisdom of faith is the last time-wise but has the first priority" both for simple faith and for logical philoso- phy (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 272). 45. Guttman, "Yesodot hamah'shava shel Rabbi Nachman Krochmal'," p. 259. 46. For example, Maimonides attacks those who wish to understand such a book as his in a wrong manner: "O you who ... engage in theoretical specula- tion using the first notions that may occur to and come to your mind and who consider withal that you understand a book that is the guide of the first and</page><page sequence="34">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 297 the last men while glancing through it as you would glance through a historical work or a piece of poetry-when, in some of your hours of leisure, you leave off drinking and copulating: collect yourself and reflect, for these things are not as you thought following the first notion that occurred to you" (The Guide of the Perplexed, Vol. 1:2, p. 24). Of course, Maimonides realizes that in certain contexts the historical-cultural circumstances are significant and that reality can change during the course of history. See, for example, his well-known explana- tion of sacrifices (The Guide of the Perplexed, Vol. 3:32, pp. 525-531) and his assessment of how the rise of Islam and Christianity caused a major change for humanity (Mishneh Torah, Judges, Laws of Kings, 11:4 [these passages do not appear in traditional editions of the book because of external censorship; Hershman's English translation (New Haven, 1949) follows the traditional ver- sion]). Traditional commentators as well as modern scholars have also noted the fact that Maimonides's view of the messianic age is historical and not escha- tological. For example, see Spero Shubert, "Maimonides and the Sense of His- tory," Tradition, Vol. 24, No. 2 (1989), pp. 128-137; and Amos Funkenstein, Maimonides: Political Theory and Realistic Messianism, Perceptions ofJewish History (Berkeley, 1993), pp. 131-155. In any case this does not give comprehensive significance to history itself. Moreover, it does not assign it a major role in changing human and cultural consciousness or any significance with regard to the concept of truth and the question of people's understanding of the truth. 47. His biblical interpretations are always based on the assumption that the esoteric truth embodied in the words of the Prophets is identical to the meta- physical truth that he knows and ascertains from philosophical tradition. Only on this basis can one justify taking the Bible out of context and adapting it to philosophical models. These considerations do not take the issues of historical development or cultural and societal circumstances into account. 48. See Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 425. 49. See "Haskala History and the Medieval Tradition," in Funkenstein, Mai- monides, pp. 234-246; and Ismar Schorsch, From Text to Context-The Turn to History in Modern Judaism (Hanover, 1994), pp. 166-173. 50. Typically, in the letter against Luzzatto that attempts to defend the fun- damentals of rational tradition in Jewish thought, Krochmal chooses to quote a central part of the introduction to this chapter that focuses on monotheism's theoretical nature. This is the only passage from his treatise cited by Krochmal in all of his letters. 51. For example, Krochmal mentions "the chapters on the Deed of Cre- ation" that he intended to compose (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 41). It is very likely that in these chapters, which were certainly intended to be a com- ponent of the third part of the treatise, Krochmal also planned to deal with anthropological issues as well as the structure of culture in general and Jewish culture in particular. 52. See Guttman, "Yesodot hamah'shava shel Rabbi Nachman Krochmal'," pp. 269ff. 53. See Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 434. Although the context of the debate is an internal Jewish matter, it clearly does not only apply under these restricted circumstances. For example, Krochmal quotes the fourth blessing of the Amidah prayer, "You graciously endow man with intelligence ...," which</page><page sequence="35">298 Yehoyada Amir definitely does not relate only to an internal Jewish aspect. It should be noted that the expression "the presence of the living spiritual essence [cevod ha'etzem haruhani]" is definitely connected to EZ. 1:28, which speaks of "the semblance of the Presence of the Lord" that is revealed to the prophet. See the similar use of this phrase in the book's third chapter, wherein Krochmal describes the formulation of faith within a person and states: "That is the very presence of the spiritual essence and his true life" (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 15). 54. See Eliezer Schweid, Toldot Hahagut Hayehudit Ba'et Hahadashah-Ha- me'ah Hayud-tet (Tel Aviv, 1978), p. 82. 55. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 29. 56. Various scholars have speculated that these or other philosophers were a major influence on Krochmal's outlook. We tend to accept, with regard to Harris's remark (Nachman Krochmal, p. 125), that these many suggestions sim- ply demonstrate that the bases for Krochmal's statements are insights, which should be perceived as part of the zeitgeist and not as a distinct historiosophic methodology. Rivka Horwitz emphasizes the fact that central elements of Krochmal's historical view are based on Jewish sources, no less than on these modern philosophic sources ("Goyim Ve'elohav le'Rabbi Nachman Krochmal Umekorotav Hayehudiyim," in Sefer Hayoval LeShlomo Pines, Vol. 1, Mekhkerei Yerushalayim Bemakhshevet Yisrael, Vol. 7, ed. Moshe Idel, Warren Zev Harvey, and Eliezer Schweid [Jerusalem, 1988], pp. 265-287). It should be noted that most of Horwitz's statements focus on the discussion of the uniqueness of Jewish history and not on the discussion in chap. 7, as the title of her article might have suggested. Nevertheless, she does make an important observation in stating that bestowing a religious tone to a nation's spirit was clearly influ- enced by Krochmal's Jewish sources and deviated from what was accepted in European philosophical discussions of the nineteenth century ("Goyim Ve'elo- hav le'Rabbi Nachman Krochmal Umekorotav Hayehudiyim," p. 283). 57. Rotenstreich's remark is therefore very puzzling. He asserts that Kroch- mal bases the historical momentum on a determination that the historical oc- currences are basically biological, a determination that has nothing to do with the spiritual dimension. He tries to prove this allegation by affirming that "the spirit, which is eternal and infinite, cannot save the process from withering away" (Hamakhshavah Hayehudit Ba'eit Hakhdashah, Vol. 1, p. 61). Roten- streich's claim completely ignores the special nature of the partially spiritual, which is also connected to the material and is therefore itself temporary. 58. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, pp. 36-37. 59. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 40, quoting B. Talmud, Megilah 29a. 60. The question as to whether Krochmal's pantheistic conception inte- grates the dimension of a personal God is complex. At times, he casts hints in this direction. However, apparently, they should only be viewed as pictorial expressions that are intended to assist the traditional reader, who is in the early stages of the educational process that Perplexed of the Time wishes to convey. 61. For an elaboration of the topic, see Amir, "Al Naharot Babel," pp. 538- 544. The transition from the second to the third cycle, which overcame the disaster incurred by the revolts against Rome and the loss of hope that it caused, can be described in a similar manner. The nation's recovery can be described as connected to the firm attitude of its leadership, a change in the</page><page sequence="36">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 299 outlook on historical reality, and so forth. Although Krochmal did not in fact do this, apparently if he had done so, then he would have gone in such a direction. In any case, he would not have gone beyond a description of an actual historical process, whose driving force is the power of faith and its mon- otheistic quality. 62. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 51, citing Isa. 11:2 regarding the new spirituality. In this messianic prophecy, Isaiah describes the king who will arise for the Jewish people and on account of whose dominion and works among the nations all "the land shall be filled with devotion to the Lord" (Isa. 11:9). Krochmal utilizes this description in order to characterize the Jewish people during the Second Temple period, thereby showing that this reality was the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy. 63. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 45. 64. For example, see B. Talmud, Yoma 9b: "Why was the first Sanctuary destroyed? Because of three [evil] things which prevailed there: idolatry, immo- rality, bloodshed." See also Megilah 10b and the end of tractate Zevahim. 65. Luz gives a conclusive survey of the various scholarly positions on this issue (Rabbi Nachman Krochmal u'beayat hahistorizatsia shel hayahadut, pp. 240- 242). His main objective is to attempt to reconcile the various divergent view- points; however, I endeavor to resolve them. 66. Harris emphatically states this (Nachman Krochmal, pp. 138-139). 67. For the relation between Krochmal's doctrine of "covert miracles" and that of Nachmanides, see Horwitz, "Goyim Ve'elohav le'Rabbi Nachman Krochmal Umekorotav Hayehudiyim," pp. 274-276. Based on Krochmal's de- scription of the events of the first cycle and the place in which he decides to hint at a future discussion of covert and overt miracles (see Kitvei Rabbi Nach- man Krochmal, p. 43), it seems very likely that, in his opinion, the difference between the cycles is not connected with actual reality but, rather, to the level and content of faith. The Bible utilizes overt miracles in order to depict the first cycle. However, this is merely an "imaginary picture" that must be trans- formed into a "cognitive picture" (see Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 41). In other words, we must view the Exodus from Egypt within the context of historical reality. 68. Of course, most of the other people who for Krochmal symbolize a paradigm and ideal belong to the third cycle. The only exception is Philo, whose lifetime (ca. 20 B.C.E.-50 C.E.) falls within the last part of the second cycle. 69. The status of halakhah in Krochmal's teachings merits a separate inves- tigation. See Sh. Bialovelovtski, "Em Lemasoret Haperush Vehahalakhah," Knesset, Vol. 6 (1941), pp. 345-380; and Harris, Nachman Krochmal, pp. 206- 273. In any case, in the letter against Luzzatto (letter 11), Krochmal proposes that the list of the "principles of faith" should be updated from time to time. For his generation, he suggests adding the "obligation to fulfill the command- ments" (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 439). Nevertheless, it should be noted that all three periods, which might be seen as formative in the development of halakhah, are described by Krochmal as belonging to "the time of growth and development" of the various cycles. This is true of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai in the first cycle, the time of</page><page sequence="37">300 Yehoyada Amir the purported Great Sanhedrin (the supreme council in the beginning of the Second Temple period), and the period of the composition of the Mishnah and Talmud in the third cycle. In all these cases, "the time of strength and work" had not yet been formed, and, therefore, they should not be viewed as the religious-spiritual zenith of these periods. For a further discussion of the relatively insignificant role of the giving of the Torah in Krochmal's historical description, see my article "Avi Ha'uma Veha'emuna Mul Adon Hanevi'im- Avraham U'moshe Bemishnato shel Rabbi Nachman Krochmel," in Avraham avi ha'maaminim-Demuto bir'i hehagut ledoroteha, ed. Moshe Hallamish, Hannah Kasher, and Yohanan Silman (Ramat Gan, 2002), pp. 205-228. 70. In addition to these decisive factors, several other levels indicating Krochmal's objective can be enumerated. For example, his emphasis that the passage from the first to the second cycle is connected to the fact that Persia, which had a dualistic religion, constituted the Jewish people's religious-cultural surroundings instead of, as in the past, nations that had an entire polytheistic pantheon (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 53). Of course, this criterion raises the third cycle, during which the Jewish people dwelled among monothe- istic peoples, to a much higher level. In this regard it should be noted that Krochmal scatters various hints of his positive attitude toward other monothe- istic religions. One should also note the language he employs in describing the time of the third cycle: "and have completely different characteristics and all their events and dynamics are imbued with a different spirit" (Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Kroch- mal, p. 112). This expression is taken from the biblical story concerning Caleb, son of Jephunneh, who in opposition to the other spies "was imbued with a different spirit and remained loyal to Me" (Num. 14:24). Thus, the different spirit is surely truer and more perfect. 71. For example, see Schweid, Likrat Tarbut Yehudit Modernit, pp. 180-189; and Guttman, "Yesodot hamah'shava shel Rabbi Nachman Krochmal'," pp. 283-286. 72. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, pp. 112, 6, 9. 73. For example, see Ps. 48:14: "that you may recount it to a future genera- tion [Ledor Aharon]"; and Ps. 78:6-8: "that a future generation might know- children yet to be born-and in turn tell their children... and not like their fathers, a wayward and defiant generation, a generation whose heart was incon- stant, whose spirit was not true to God." See also the beginning of the intro- duction to Perplexed of the Time wherein God is termed "He who announced the generations from the start," clearly hinting at Isa. 41:4: "Who has wrought and achieved this? He who announced the generations from the start-I, the Lord, who was first and will be with the last as well." 74. Kitvei Rabbi Nachman Krochmal, p. 425. 75. According to their context, the verses that I have cited from the book of Deuteronomy hint that this renaissance contains a distinctly national character, which contains a clear connection to the Land of Israel. Although Eliezer Sch- weid does not refer to this statement, he does attempt to show that Krochmal's view is nationalistic and even proto-Zionistic within the general context of the matters discussed (Likrat Tarbut Yehudit Modernit, pp. 87-92). Taubes views the phrase "the end of days," which Krochmal often employs in order to refer to</page><page sequence="38">Krochmal and the Modern Jewish Experience 301 his generation, as an expression of his feeling that the haskalah is the end of history and the apex of its religious and spiritual development. See J. Taubes, "Nachman Krochmal and Modern Historicism," Judaism, Vol. 12 (1963), pp. 150-164. Harris is not aware of the significance of the biblical context that Krochmal hints at. He disputes Taubes and brings up the quotation that I have cited in order to prove that Krochmal's generation represents decadence and decay, not progress (Nachman Krochmal, p. 40n32). Although one should have reserva- tions with regard to his presentation of the matter, nevertheless, it is clear that Krochmal does not have a totally positive opinion of his generation. Each scholar has chosen to emphasize a different aspect of the dialectic double value involved in Krochmal's view. 76. Thus, for example, at the beginning of the book, while discussing how Ps. 137 should be understood, Krochmal does not discuss the value of histori- cal truth in and of itself. Instead, he analyzes the two opposing views of reli- gious education and of a theoretical-religious view. See Amir, "Al Naharot Babel," pp. 530-534. 77. See Schweid, "The Perplexed of the Times as a Model of Jewish Cul- ture," p. 65.</page></plain_text>
