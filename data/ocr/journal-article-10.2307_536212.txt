<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of American Folklore among the rural Negroes is marked both by European rituals and by ceremonies re- flecting the influence of African customs. Among the African features are the provid- ing of food and drink for the mourners, the visit to the grave, and story-telling during the wake of a child. Syncretization of African and European customs is noted in the intervention of the African-like spirits during the funeral and in the attitudes of fear, respect, and "worship" revealed toward the soul of a person who has recently died. Among the city Negroes mortuary rites are essentially the same as those among the whites with the exception of the great importance attached to the dead person's being properly buried. Among Africans, only one who is properly buried can enter the land of the dead and there assume his rightful place. At the wakes there are games reminis- cent of the festivities in Africa to amuse and honor the dead; and in the cult houses of the city the ceremonies for the dead are closer to the African pattern than in the rural areas. The book, on the whole, is excellent for the care it reveals in the recording of details of the cultural elements chosen for study and in the analysis and interpretation of the acculturative processes. Especially is this true of Chapters III, V, and VI. Investiga- tions of this kind are rare and are greatly needed. This one should inspire more studies employing the same approach in other New World areas. LORENZO D. TURNER Roosevelt College, Chicago, Illinois Grundziige des Estnischen Volksglaubens I. By Oskar Loorits. (Skrifter Utgivna av Kungl. Gustav Adolfs Akademien f6r Folkslivforskning, i8: i, Lund: Carl Bloms Boktryckeri A.-B., I949. Pp. xvi+591.) The author of this volume used to be director of the Estonian Folklore Archives founded in I927; he now resides, along with many another distinguished Estonian scholar, in Sweden. The importance of Estonia in folklore is well known: its remarkably rich collection of materials, products of the intermingling of eastern and western traits superimposed upon the ancient Uralic heritage, runs well over seven hundred thousand pages. Publi- cations based on the Archives are impressive both as to quality and quantity, and the name of Loorits is prominently associated with these in both respects. The present work-produced under the handicap of its author's exile from the Archives-is offered as a synthesis of much new information concerning Estonian religious beliefs rather than as a testing ground for fresh hypotheses. The subject being complex and multifarious, there is a great deal of internal cross-referencing and some repetitiousness, but what the fabric of organization lacks in smoothness is more than compensated for by the comprehensive and definitive coverage. There is an Estonian folk song which claims: "When I die, I shall disintegrate into three parts-my body (ihu) will go into the grave and my soul (hing) into heaven; my name (nimi) will be stirring on earth." Accordingly, the early chapters deal with these major topics: mana, live bodies and corpses, shades and associated spooks, the breath as soul, names and allied verbal tabus. The second half of the first volume is devoted to special spirits, transformations, animism, mythological concepts, ghosts, anthropomorphism, and guardian spirits. A sorely wanted index will be published, it is announced, after the completion of the entire work, that is, presumably, after the second volume appears. The thread of argument is bolstered throughout with texts-tales and legends, proverbs, and songs-translated from Estonian into German as literally as possible; it is illustrated with maps and photographs. 492</page><page sequence="2">Loorits regards manism and animism as the twin-pillars of Estonian religious life. Shamanism may be a third prop, though "in stark degenerierter Form" (p. io). On the other hand, polytheism cannot come into consideration, and neither does the Estonian folk tradition confirm the doctrine of a single supreme deity, since it is clearly pantheistically inclined. Even today, Estonian thinking vigorously bears a magical cast. THOMAS A. SEBEOK Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana Istoriniai Padavimai (Lithuanian Historical Legends). Edited by Jonas Balys. (Chicago: Lietuvit Katalikt Spaudos Draugija, 1949. Pp. IOI.) This booklet, written primarily for Lithuanian readers, contains 95 legends col- lected in Lithuania by various persons between about 1900 and 1938 and published here for the first time. Some of the stories are close variants, e.g., 48 and 49, 51 and 52, 69-72, 8i and 82, 88 and 89. The texts are all in the standard language though some abound in expressions (Slavic borrowings) which are now considered dialectal. About half of the stories refer to historical events, such as foreign invasions, plague and famine, Russian revolutions, serfdom, local history, while the others deal with more or less universal topics (witches, enchanted places, hidden treasures, traveling lakes, devils, saints, etc.) connected with some specific place. For each text the place where it was heard is given, in most cases also the name of the story-teller (usually with indication of age) and that of the collector. There is no bibliography or any other reference to other publications on Lithuanian folklore. On the other hand, there is a motif-index (pp. 93-101) in English, based on and referring to Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature. Not all story-tellers are reliable. Thus, in No. I3 (written down in 1932) the informant (then 89 years old) claims to have met French soldiers on their way to Moscow in 1812, while in No. 63 (a story of seven lines) the informant (73 years old) mentions first the devil and then a fairy in the same function. There are fads in story-telling. In No. 4 (taken down in 1911) the informant states that in his time people spoke very little of the plague while 50 years earlier old people used to refer to it quite frequently. The only footnote made (p. 58) calls for a brief comment. The two meanings 'castle' and 'door lock' of Lith. zamkus (which is borrowed from Polish and not from Russian) appear already in Polish zamek where, according to Aleksander Brickner, Slownik etymologiczny jezyka polskiego, p. 644, the meaning 'castle' is secondary, under the influence of German Schloss which has also both meanings. In modern Lithuanian, zamkus 'castle' is only used as a proper noun, the name for the castle of Kaunas (as indicated by Balys) and of the castle of Raudone (information from my colleague, Professor Salys).
