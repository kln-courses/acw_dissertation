<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stephen Kalberg Max Weber's analysis of the rise of * - monothelsm: a reconstructlon ABS I RAC 1 Hidden within Max Weber's Ancient Judaism, 'The Sociology of Religion' chapter in Economy and Society, and The Religion of China lies a causal explanation for the rise of monotheism in ancient Israel. Weber's powerful analysis becomes apparent only if reconstructed by reference to central tenets of the causal methodology that underlie his diverse substantive texts. If'adequate causality' is to be achieved, (a) facilitating and necessary orientations of action, and (b) synchronic and diachronic interactions of action must be present. Yet Weber's causal methodology does not involve simply a 'weighing' of positive or favouring orientations of action against obstructing action; nor does it rely upon linear 'causal chain' procedures. Rather, the conjunctural interactions of patterned action that occur within a context of patterned action are pivotal. This three-stage methodology guides this reconstruction of Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism. Buried deeply within Max Weber's classical study, Ancient Judaism (1952), as well as 'The Sociology of Religion' chapter in Economy and Society ( 1968) and The Religion of China ( 195 1), lies a powerful sociological analysis of the rise of monotheism in ancient Israel. Unfortunately, to this day, it has remained unknown. In part, Weber himself must be held responsible: the poor organization and generally obtuse character of Ancient Judaism, as well as the fact that he fails to offer adequate introductory and concluding overviews, has obscured this analysis. Moreover, Weber never lays out his causal methodology in this volume. Nor does he systematically present his procedures and strategies to establish causality in Economy and Society or his methodo- logical essays. Yet any hope of understanding his analysis of the rise of monotheism - the major task of this study - depends upon an understanding of his causal methodology.

All investigations of subjective meaning must be supplemented by causal procedures and strategies that capture empirically observed factors: 'In every case and as much as possible, the "understanding" of a relationship must, before a seemingly evident meaningful interpre- tation can be viewed as a valid "interpretive explanation", be checked using the normal methods of causal assesstnent; (1973: 428; see also 1968: 12/6; 1975: 160/162, 197/136).' However, Weber offers re- markably few clues regarding his causal methodology. Because never articulated clearly, it must be reconstructed from his comparative- . * . . *. hlstorlcal wrltlngs.' Several patterns emerge from a close reading of The Agrarian Sociology orAncient Civilizations ( 1976), General Economic History (1927), Economy and Society (1968), and, especially, T/ae Economic Ethics of the World Relig?ons.3 Two stages stand at the foundation of this method- ology: a distinction between 'facilitating' and 'necessary' orientations of action on the one hand and synchronic (within the present) and diachronic (between past and present) interactions of action on the other.4 Though unstated, both of these distinctions are pivotal and run throughout these empirical texts. They must, however, be seen as preliminary stages in his causal methodology; his substantive writingst' testify that entire constellations of regular action-orientations alone constitute effective causal forces. Because a particular effect may arise not only from an array of action-orientations but also from their variable ordering, the importance of the context of patterned action must be acknowledged. Within demarcated contexts conjunctural interactions of diverse action-orientation occur, and these interactions imply causation. Weber is convinced that new regularities of action may, in a reverberating fashion, recast an entire multitude of . . . actlon-orlentatlons . Thus, Weber's causal methodology does not involve simply an identification of positive or favouring orientations of action and their 'weighing' against other patterned actions that impede and obstruct. Moreover, his attention to delineated historical factors does not lead him to formulate a methodology based only upon 'causal chain' models of multiple forces (see Collins 1981). Both of these procedures imply a linearity fundamentally foreign to his substantive as well as methodological writings. For Weber, regular orientations of action never stand alone. Rather, they exist in constellations and interact continuously, indeed to such a degree that the creation of a single effect is extremely unlikely. Thus, multi-causal assumptions alone are not sufficient; in addition, a contextual mode of explanation endowed with the analytic power to conceptualize hosts of natterned action- orientations and the conjunctural relationships between them is required.</page><page sequence="3">Max Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism 565 In sum, if 'adequate causality',6 according to Weber's causal methodology, is to be achieved, (a) facilitating and necessary orien- tations of action7 and (b) synchronic and diachronic interaction must be present. Moreover, (c) the conjunctural interactions of patterned action that occur within a context of patterned action must be identified. By acknowledging the causal importance of both the present and the past and integrating single facilitating and necessary action-orientations into a fabric of multiple action-orientations, such dynamic interactions alone,8 in Weber's texts, provide adequate causal explanations of patterned action. If this three-stage methodology is taken as a guiding frame of reference, Weber's fragmented analysis of the rise of monotheism concealed within AncientJudaism, The Relig?on of China9 and 'The Sociology of Religion' chapter in Economy and Society (1968: 399-634/245-381) can be reconstructed. Ancient Israel's monotheistic God must first be briefly described. As a fully universal, sovereign Lord, Yahwe, the mighty God of ancient Israel, was endowed with omnipotence, ominiscience and consummate ethical qualities. As a deity who, in an instant, altered nature and the course of history to conform to his grand design and to punish the sinful, this ruler governed over the universe and heavens as a sublime monarch. As a God of just ethical compensation and as one who made his grace conditional upon the keeping of his commandmentsS the earthly fortune of individuals followed as the 'fruit of their doing'. He alone had created the world out of nothing and the destinies of entire nations were subject to his whims. For him, the manipulation of kings was indeed child's play. As Israel's monotheistic, ethical and universal God who had ascended to 'the highest position of power' and 'an absolutely supramundane su- premacy', all other gods and peoples became subject to Yahwe's will (see Weber 1952: 284/298, 301-2/315-17, 308-9/3234; 1968: 474/ 289; 1951:21/299). Although 'beginnings . . . toward some form of consistent mono- theism' can be found 'almost everywhere' (1968:419/257), only in ancient Israel did this type of God endure over the centuries as unequivocally superior to all other gods. In all other religions, these 'beginnings' were circumscribed and 'thwarted by practical impedi- ments' (1968: 419/257). As Weber notes, 'Only in the Middle East has this idea of God retained the upper hand with such forcefulness' (1951: 21/299). However, to him, Yahwe had not always been a monotheistic divinity. Originally a great war god not unlike those found universally, he ascended to the status of an omnipotent and omniscient deity only in a particular historical period - the classical era (c.700-500 BC) - and as a consequence of a series of historical occurrences. Just his unique and extremely significant development, Weber is convinced, can be addressed sociologically. To him,</page><page sequence="4">566 Stephen Kalberg Just as forms of gods vary, depending on natural and social conditions, so too there are variations in the potential of a god to achieve primacy in the pantheon, or to monopolize divinity. (1968: 415/255) A whole series of purely historical motives have determined the development, which was fraught with momentous consequences, toward the supramundane or the immanent conception of God. (1946b: 286/258; altered translation) it is naturally true that [the various kinds of gods and demons] . . . have been shaped directly and mainly by the economic situation and the historical destinies of different peoples. (1968:409/251; alt. trans. ) 10 None the less, and despite these statements, as well as the discussion in AncientJudaism of the multiple factors that led to monotheism, Weber never offered a systematic analysis of the rise to dominance of monotheism. Reference to his three-stage causal methodology noted above enables a reconstruction of his analysis. l ' DEGREES OF CAUSAL CEN'I'RALI'I'Y: FACILI'I'A'I'ING AND NECESSARY PA'I''I'ERNS OF AC'I'ION Facilitatingractc)rs As opposed to necessary action-orientations, facilitating action-orien- tations in Weber's causal methodology constitute less powerful background factors. Widespread and not indispensable, these pat- terns of action provide a favourable context for the rise of the phenomenon to be explained. In order to isolate these action-orien- tations, Weber undertakes cross-cultural comparisons. As he notes, 'Obviously, [considerations] other than economic [considerations] . . . played a part' (1951: 21/299; alt. trans.). (a) The warri(lr g(lsl (lf the 01s1 C(lnfederacy: warfare and ge(lgraphical p(lsiti(ln Surrounded on all sides by worldly kingdoms, the small states of Israel and Judaea felt perpetually threatened by their powerful neighbours. Yet, miraculously, the Old Confederacy'sl2 peasant militia repeatedly emerged victorious over its numerous enemies. Most significantly, the Old Confederacy's small and undisci- plined peasant army of charismatic ecstatics freed this nation from Egyptian bondage and conquered the seemingly impregnable armies of the bureaucratically organized neighbouring kingdoms in the Wars of Liberation. Accordingly, the status of their warrior god, Yahwe, ascended to great heights and sacrifices began to be offered to him. As</page><page sequence="5">567 Max Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism Yahwe continued in later epochs to lead the Old Confederacy's army of noble warlords to victory over the surrounding world empires, his status continued to rise dramatically. Highly anthropomorphic, wrathful and jealous, he existed as an aloof and unapproachable 'god from afar' who intervened in warfare through clouds and thunderstorms to aid and inspire his charismatic warriors. Fires, desert winds, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions accompanied his appearances. The vast powers, boundless passion and unyielding anger attributed to this deity assumed prodigious proportions (Weber 1952: 127/137). During the period of the Old Confederacy, Yahwe developed into a highly individualized, com- manding supernatural being and became acknowledged as its single legitimate war god. Perpetual warfare and the threat of war played a pivotal part in this development. (b) Bureaucratic kingship, the plebeian stratum and the weakening of mag;7c In the Near East, strong and centralized bureaucratic king- ships presided over by a dynastic line of mighty kings - in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Assyria and Arabia- arose, largely in response to the necessity for artificial irrigation. No natural rainfall capable of sustain- ing a regular harvest existed in this region, and thus a centralized agency empowered with the capacity to organize manpower on behalf of huge irrigation projects became a necessity. In a very real sense, then, the harvest in this area depended upon the activities of kings, who'directly"created" the harvest' (1951: 21/298).'3 This acknowledgement inclined subjects to envisage their gods as similar to these powerful kings: In the desert and semiarid regions of the Near East this control of irrigation waters was probably one source of the conception of a god who had created the earth and man out of nothing.... A riparian economy of this kind actually did produce a harvest out of nothing, from the desert sands. (1968: 449/274; see also 1951: 21/298-9) Moreover, these great 'patrimonial' rulers also created law and codified statutes. For Weber, it is not at all surprising that the experiencing by subjects of these monumental feats induced them to understand the order of the world 'as the law of a freely acting, transcendental and personal God' (1968: 449/274). To him: 'the personal, transcendental and ethical god . . . corresponds so closely to that of an all-powerful mundane king with his rational bureaucratic regime that a causal connection can scarcely be denied' (1968: 448/ 2734). However, as Weber emphasizes after conducting further compari- sons, although the growth of great empires favoured the appearance of monotheism, it did so with varying degrees of success. This is clearly evidenced in the cases of China, Persia and Rome, where bureaucratic</page><page sequence="6">568 Stephen Kalberg kingdoms appeared, yet monotheism failed to develop (1968:418/ 256; on China, see 1951: 22-3/299-301). Even when a solar cult arose to support the 'dynastic, politically conditioned' monotheism of Ikhnaton in the Middle Kingdom in Egypt (1365A8 BC,), this view of the transcendental realm failed to survive this charismatic ruler (1952: 204/218; 1968: 419/257). None the less, the bureaucratic kingship of the United Monarchy surely facilitated the development of monotheism. It did so in another way as well: it intensified and expanded dramatically the plebeian class. In comparison to feudalism, which typically left most of its population immersed within the universe of magic, Solomon's patri- monial regime extended its centralized administration to all groups within its rulership, generally mobilizing its people to construct fortifications and palaces, to till the royal demesne, and to move into cities. Similar to the Mediterranean polis, the Israelite city developed into, at one, a marketplace, a fortress, a seat of the army, and a base for the respective monarchical or oligarchical authorities (1952: 14/17). In expanding the civic strata of artisans, craftsmen and corvee labourers, this form of rulership had the effect of orienting Israelite society to new rhythms based upon daily tasks radically disjunctive from the peasant life in harmony with the forces of nature. In detaching a large share of the peasantry from these forces, which were always believed to be supernatural and within which magic typically thrived, patrimonialism attempted to habituate this class to a 'practical rationalism' characterized by a systematic division of labour, a linear organization of work, the rational accounting of one's tasks, and economic calculations.'4 Thus, the growth of the plebeian strata implied, to Weber, a clear weakening of magic. I n the process, support for local and functional deities, which was typical of this form of interaction with the transcendent realm, was weakened. Weber notes several further facilitating patterns of action, all of which also contributed to the formulation of a context within which, given additional constellations of conducive action-orientations and their interaction in a specific way, a genuine monotheism might develop. Weber views Yahwe's status as a foreign god in this manner: this particular quality of 'effective influence from afar', which re- sulted from the reception of a foreign god by Israel, was a factor in the development of the concept of Yahwe as the universal and om- nipotent God. For, as a rule, the fact that a god was regarded as a local deity, or that he sometimes demanded of his followers exclus- ive 'monolatry' did not lead to monotheism, but rather tended to strengthen religious particularism. (1968: 414/254; alt. trans.) Yahwe's esteem was also reaffirmed as a consequence of his particular promises. These were invariably pragmatic and involved actual political affairs (such as salvation from Egyptian bondage or dominion</page><page sequence="7">Max Weber's analysis l)f the rise l)+mlml)theism 569 over the Canaanites) rather than abstract and transcendent values (1952: 153/164-5, 126/136). Finally, Yahzve was also the god of a confederation, the formation of which, between the twelve tribes of Israel andJudaea and this mighty god, represented, to Weber, 'at least a first approach to universalistic monotheism' (1968: 418/256-7).'-' T hese facilitating orientations of action created a context favour- able to the unfolding of monotheism. Standing alone, however, they remained indirect, background action-orientations and largely in- effective. Weber's causal analysis also identifies a series of necessary patterns of action, as well as the manner in which entire constellations of synchronic and diachronic action-orientations interacte(l in a dy- namic fashion. NecessaFractc)rs Whereas facilitating regularities of action appear both where the phenomenon to be explained exists as well as in its absence and must be viewed more as background action-orientations, necessary patterns of action convey, in Weber's causal methodology, a far more direct causality. Powerful and indispensable, these critical regularities of action exhibit a direct association with the historical development to be explained and can be viewed as a precondition and valid cause. Through historically based and cross-civilizational comparisons, Weber again attempts, when he turns to necessary action-orientations, to isolate patterns of action unique to the context in which the phenomenon to be explained arose. Having done so, he evaluates whether these action-orientations can be assessed as not only causally related to the case under investigation, but also necessary for its origin. (a) The berith Neither a sun god nor a god of a specific dynasty, Yahwe became Israel's god as a result of the 'treaty of confederation', or berith. This explicit promise, which was given to Moses by Yahwe, committed him to protect and stand behind his people 'through thick and thin'. This 'contractual relationship . . . despite numerous ana- logues, is found nowhere else in such intensity' (Weber 1968:413/ 253): In its special relation to god, Israel stood in contrast to all other nations because of . . . the unique conclusion of a covenant. Israel's special relationship to god was not merely guaranteed by god, but had been concluded with god as a party to it.... The uniqueness [of the liberation from Egyptian bondage through the miraculous destruction of an Egyptian army in the Red Sea] was constituted by the fact that this miracle was effected by a god till then unknown by Israel and who thereupon was accepted through solemn berith by Moses's establishment of Yahwe worship.... The special perma- nent obligations of the people to god were justified by the pledges of</page><page sequence="8">570 Stephen Kalberg the people and the promises of god offered in turn. This made of him a god of promise for Israel in a sense unknown to any other god (1952: 118/12S7). the peculiarity [of Israelite history] consists in the first place in the extensive employment of the religious 'berith' as the actual (or construed) basis of the most varied legal and moral relations. Above all, Israel itself as a political community was conceived as an oathbound confederation. (1952: 75/82) As a consequence of the covenant between Yahwe and the peoples of the twelve tribes of Israel and Judaea, this mighty god could not be simply a functional, tribal or local deity. Fven though such gods, like Yahwe, also remained loyal to their people, Yahwe's loyalty originally derived from the particularized and historically traceable contract between him and 'his people' (see 1952: 131/141, 124/133, 134/144- 5). In addition, this divinity's vow to support the 'children of Israel' as his chosen people carried with it a demand for an exclusive loyalty on their part to him. Those Israelites who worshipped other gods were believed to have scorned Yahwe personally, to have violated the covenant, and to have 'defected' from him. Moreover, since the berith had been made by Moses in the name of all Israelites, those who, for example, failed to obey the C)ld Confederacy's decrees (e.g. a call to arms) were understood by Yahwe as having refused to serve him personally. At such times 'Yahwe, behaved as a king, given to wrath if the obligations due him through "berith" remained unfulfilled' (1952: 136/147; see also pp. l 30-1/140-1). Yet Yahwe was not only a wrathful god. Indeed, his anger as well as his capacity to assist the Israelites stemmed from the same idiosyn- cratic 'special relationship' that the 'chosen people' had with their deity: 'You only have I known of all the families of the earth. . .' (Amos 3: 2). In essence, the 'treaty of confederation' explicitly favoured the Israelites, and those peoples who did not know Yahwe's commandments were viewed as inferior. Furthermore, although the systematic laws of the Book of the Covenant did not generally, in their substance, differ from those formulated in other civilizations in the pre-classical and classical eras, they derived their great significance as a result of the 'berith with Yahwe'. This dominating factor in the life of the Israelites lfi slowly altered the conception of the Book of the Covenant from a collection of legal ordinances to imperatives contain- ing moral powers. 17 The manner in which the berith linked Yahwe with the destiny of the Israelites in an inextricable way, such that obligations were incurred on both sides, led eventually to an interpretation of'the entire history of the Hebrew nation as consisting of the deeds of Yahwe and hence as constituting a pattern of "world history"' (1968: 418/257). This</page><page sequence="9">Max Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism 571 centrality of Yahwe indicated as well a transformation of this god from a powerful warrior deity to an even more mighty and a-wesome divinity. The covenant played a central and necessary role in this process. (b) Missionary prophecy In accentuating Yahwe's powers and his demanding character through their pronouncements and speeches, the emissary prophetslS in the classical era served as carriers of this deity's ethical commandments and as the indispensable mediaries of his universal, ethical and permanent character. As political misfor- tunes and military disasters of enormous magnitude continued to plague the Israelites - and as the prophets trumpeted all calamities as evidence of Yahwe's herculean will and vast powers (1968: 418/257) - this deity's stature increased dramatically. As they explained, it was Yahwe who had led them to freedom and out of the Egyptian 'house of bondage'. As the prophets again made clear in their speeches and pronouncements, this same mighty deity had also allowed the great kings of the surrounding empires to destroy Israel and send the Israelites into exile. This occurred as a consequence of their unfaith- fulness, disloyalty and failure to obey the commandments. Further, as the prophets explained, the Israelites were allowed to return from the Exile to their own land simply as a result of the grace of this magnanimous god (1968: 450/274). Eventually, Yahwe became viewed by the 'children of Israel' as not only an ethical deity, but also an absolutely transcendental and fully universal deity. Not every ethical god acquired these features; on the contrary, these traits are unique to the 'God of the Jewish prophets' (1968:518/314-15). According to Weber, this divinity became en- dowed with these qualities as a result of 'the speculation and the ethical dynamic of passionate prophets' (1968: 518/31 X 15). He was 'critically influenced by the distinctive character of "ethical" prophecy' (1968: 419/257): Without the tremendous prestige of these demagogues known and feared by all the people, it is difficult to see how the conception of Yahwe as the god of the universe, the destroyer and rebuilder of Jerusalem could have become authoritative. (1952: 334/350; see also 333/349; 1968: 419/257) Thus, these charismatic figures played a central part in the recasting of this warrior god into an omnipotent, omniscient and monotheistic . . . c ,lvlnlty. All of these necessary and facilitating orientations of action - towards the berith, the proclamations of charismatic prophets, bureau- cratic kingship, the ethos of civic strata, warfare, and the great warrior god Yahwe, and away from magic - assumed particular importance due to the absence, from the period of the Old Confederacy to the</page><page sequence="10">572 Stephen Kalberg epoch of classical prophecy, of significant obstacles to the develop- ment of monotheism. A strong priesthood, which typically created, defended and systematized an array of functional gods and regulated the cults of particular gods (see 1968:419/257), never assumed a predominant position. Although the 'royal' priests of the United Monarchy attained a certain power, Weber concluded through comparisons that their strength did not compare to that of priest- hoods in the surrounding kingdoms, such as Mesopotamia and Egypt, all of whom defended entire pantheons of gods (1968:449/274).1-' Nor were those strata that created the religious ethics of Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism and T aoism - speculative intellectuals indifferent to mundane concerns who typically viewed the tran- scendent realm as dominated by an immanent and a cosmic 'All-One' - powerful in ancient Israel (1968: 448-9/273A, 431/263). Combined with the absence of obstacles to the rise of monotheism, the above facilitating and necessary action-orientations proved pivotal in the development of an omnipotent and omniscient God in ancient I srael. None the less, and even though Yahwe's esteem rose to stupendous heights and compelling'beginnings' toward the acknow- ledgement of him as the Israelites' monotheistic Cod existed, an authentic monotheism did not arise as a result merely of a predomi- nance of 'favourable' and 'crucial' patterns of action. 9') Weber's dynamic causal methodology does not involve simply a 'weighing' of such action-orientations. Regardless of how 'exhaustive' they may appear when in combination, alone they never constitute an adequate causal explanation. Despite his adherence to the axiom of multi- causality inherent in the causal chain approach, he advocates, in clear opposition to this procedure, the examination of cc)ntexts within which clusters of factors appear. He is concerned, in this regard, to identify the manner in which regular action-orientations interact in synchro- nic, diachronic and conjunctural ways. 'I'HE VEPENDENGE UPON SOCIAL C,ON'I'EX'I' 1: SYNCHRONIC AND DIAC,HRONIC, IN'I'ERAt8'I'ION PROf8EDURES Synchronic (within the present) and diachronic (between past and present) interactions of patterned actioll occur on a regular basis throughout Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism. Of most interest to hiln, in order to establish adequate causality, are those interactions at the level of necessary causality. The identification of synchronic and diachronic interactions constitutes a major procedure in Weber's causal methodology. A genuine monotheism appeared in ancient Israel after the decline of the United Monarchy and shortly before and during the First Exile. Synchronic and diachronic interactions were critical, indeed to such</page><page sequence="11">573 Max Weber's analysis c)f the rise c)f mc)n()theism an extent that they called forth a distinct strengthening of necessary . patterns ot actlon. Synchronic interactic)n The interaction of orientations of action toward missionary prophecy with action oriented toward patrimonial-bureaucratic kingship tended to accelerate the development of monotheism. This occurred as a result of patrimonialism's creation of a broad plebeian stratum uprooted from magic. In castigating magical practices, the emissary prophets further weakened their influence. Once disentangled from the magical cosmos, the plebeian stratum proved highly susceptible to the message of these great prophets, including an acceptance of their vision of Yahwe. The interaction of action oriented towards ethical prophecy and action oriented towards the berith also strengthened the development towards monotheism. Purely religious considerations relating directly to the problem of suffering proved foremost here. As a result of the sacred contract with Yahwe, a ready explanation for evil existed: as the prophets stated, this overwhelming deity himself was responsible for evil, for he wished to punish the Israelites for flagrantly breaking his commandments (1952:311/325, 301/315). This capacity to punish tended to strengthen both the belief of the Israelites in the berith and their conception of Yahwe as an awesome god. These synchronic interactions of action-orientations at the level of necessary causality are central to Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism. He also identifies, on a regular basis, empirical diachro- nic interactions. Weber's causal methodology requires that both types of interaction must be charted clearly and assessed. Diachrc)nic interactic)n Weber's understanding of 'societies' as only loosely held together and as constituted from numerous competing and reciprocally interacting patterns of action-orientations by persons in delineated groupings convinces him of the extreme importance, for any explanation of the present, of past developments. It persuades him as well that estab- lished historical forces permeate in multiple, often clandestine, ways deeply into the present, and that a conceptualization of societies as either a Gemeinschaft or Gesellschaft or as 'traditional' or 'modern' must be rejected as far too global. Weber also stands firm against the position that past action-orientations, if influential in the present at all, remain of limited impact and little long-term consequence. Instead, for him, the past penetrates into the present repeatedly and deeply. Indeed, despite the advent of drastic contextual metamorphoses, past patterned social action may play a distinct and influential causal role in</page><page sequence="12">574 Stephen Kalberg epochs far removed from its origin: 'That which has been handed down from the past becomes everywhere the immediate precursor of that taken in the present as valid' (1968: 29/15; alt. trans.). Even the abrupt appearance of 'the new' - even the 'supernatural' power of charisma - never fully ruptures ties to the past (see Kalberg 1994: 15948; see p.576 below). These fundamental premises run throughout Weber's empirical analyses. A distinct mode of diachronic interaction is pivotal in his analysis of the rise of monotheism. Weber calls the reader's attention repeatedly to the manner in which certain action-orientations form antecedent conditicms2l for the development of new patterns of action- orientations. Such precursors may become significant causal forces.22 Certain patterns of action formed in the period of the Old Confederacy remained secure and established clear antecedent con- ditions that invigorated the tendency toward monotheism in the classical epoch. Perhaps the towering stature Yahwe attained in the earlier period as a result of the berith with him, his successes as a war god, and the proclamations of seers and auditory prophets consti- tuted the most central precedents. This remained the case even though Yahwe did not, during the Old Confederacy, espouse an eternally valid ethic, nor could he be ethically judged (1952: 136/ 147). Instead, he existed simply as the federal god of the conquering oathbound Confederacy who sought to fulfil his duty as the sole protector of its sovereignty, ritualistic customs and mores (1952: 111/ 120-1,131/141,80/88-9,91/99). Nor was this deity recognized at this time as a fully universal divinity, even though 'features transcending Israel ... were inherent in the conception of Yahwe' and 'in this sense a certain universalism' existed (1952: 133/143). Even the ecstatic prophets and early Nebiim seers of this era were not persuaded that Yahwe belonged exclusively to Israel. None the less, he was this epoch's greatest deity (1952: 134/144, 138-9/148-50, 123/ 132) .23 He assumed the form of an ancient warlord who rescued the Old Confederacy and destroyed its enemies as well as a frightful god of natural catastrophes who created plagues and a variety of disasters to punish those who had aroused his anger. His grandeur and mighty powers became entrenched to such a degree that, despite his decline during Solomon's reign and the era of the United Monarchy, he continued to dominate the Israelites' vision of the transcendent realm. The idealization of the Old Confederacy by the missionary prophets and their followers in the classical period must also be seen as a central antecedent condition. The large and exploited plebeian stratum in the classical era proved particularly susceptible to pronouncements that romanticized the 'good old times', as an epoch of justice as well as social equality, and attacked the present as an era of rampant abuses against</page><page sequence="13">Max Weber's analysis of the rise of mc)n()theism 575 the poor. In confronting oppression and harking back to the earlier, more simple period, the ethical prophets uniformly portrayed the pre-kingly era as one of justice due to the reign of Yahwe. The direct association of this fearful deity with an idealized epoch tended to enhance his status dramatically. Although central throughout Weber's substantive texts and although they convey vividly the importance he attributes to the past in all analyses of the present, antecedent conditions never imply, for him, adequate causality. Moreover, despite their strong causal impact, it should not be concluded that simple reference to 'causal chains' - once all relevant action-orientations appear together, then a causal explanation of the case or development under investigation is established-accurately captures Weber's causal methodology. Such a 'static' approach remains, to him, both unilinear and drastically incomplete. First, it neglects an assessment of the capacity of stable action- orientations to remain strong and impede the transformation of social action. Weber does not assume that, once a 'causal chain' has been formed, such patterned action will be overcome. Second, causal chains offer no means of ascertaining the relative strength of particular causal action-orientations. In separating 'facilitating' from 'necessary' regularities of action, Weber practises a research strategy that in principle distinguishes degrees of causal centrality. A final weakness of the causal chain approach calls attention to a general weakness in all approaches that attend only to interaction, whether synchronic or diachronic: the obliviousness to the embeddedness of single factors in discrete social contexts and the ways in which varying contexts may assert diverse influences upon these single factors. This occurs to such a degree that the same pattern of action will often, depending upon its context, have a different effect. The causal chain approach neglects just this consideration. Weber, on the other hand, isolates and notes as causally significant in itself, first, the interaction of significant factors in discrete social contexts and, second, the crystallization, as a result of this interaction, of significant causal forces. This is the subject of the following section: the conjunctural interaction of patterned action. While both synchronic and diachornic interactions of action served to compleInent one another and to strengthen facilitating and necessary regularities of action, Weber saw that a genuine monotheism arose in the classical epoch only when further action-orientations appeared. These patterns of action not only solidified a social context favourable to the rise of monotheism, but also juxtaposed an array of separate action-orientations such that a constellation of forces conjuncturally interacted in a singular dy- namic.</page><page sequence="14">576 Stephen Kalberg 1 H E l)EPEN DENtsk U ['0N SOfn I AI, (,C)N I EX I 11: Al)EQUA I E ('AUSAI I I Y FRONt l)YNAMI(, IN I FRAt, I ION PROfsE1)UKES Weber's comparative-historical texts examine patterned action within a delineated cc)ntext of multiple action-orientations. When this occurs, action-orientations interact in a manner qualitatively different to the linear synchronic and diachronic interactions noted thus far; a conjunctural, or dynamic, interaction takes place. A significant causal thrust is set in motion by this interaction itself. If, for Weber, adequate causality is to be established, the isolation and clear identification of these interactions are pivotal. Before defining conjunctural inter- action, the manner in which his empirical texts attend to contexts of multiplied action-orientations must be briefly examined. Weber's substantive texts testify that regular action is always in principle influenced by a context of action-orientations (see Kalberg 1994: 39- 46,98-102,168-77). For example, to Weber, even the rise of charismatic leaders depends upon a context of action-orientations.'94 Even ethical prophecy, which Weber sees as a great charismatic force capable of shattering stereo- typed ritual norms and revolutionizing daily life (see, e.g., 1968: 577/ 349, 1116-17/657-8), is normally dependent for its development upon the existence of a 'certain minimum of intellectual culture' (1968: 486/296). Such an emphasis upon contexts extends even to a quite specific level. For example, the revisions of the Book of the Covenant that were incorporated into Deuteronomy, Weber argues, could only have taken place in the period 'when the realm of Judah was in fact almost identical with the polis of Jerusalem with its small satellite towns and villages' (1952: 65-6/71).'2 ' Each milieu of regular action-orientations, Weber insists, places a particular imprint upon patterned action. In the process, its impact as well as its substance is shaped. tRhe action-orientations themselves, or the fact of their appearance, fail to capture his attention; rather, he emphasi7es that, if new action-orientations are to expand and attain sociological signifUl- cance, the social setting within which they occur remains central. Weber seeks, throughout his substantive texts, to integrate 'the "particular fact" . . . as a real cause into a real, hence concrete context' (1949: 135/237; emphasis is original; alt. trans.). His attention to the context of action-orientations follows from a specific empirical observation: the interaction of patterned action within a milieu of multiple patterns of action occurs in a conjunctural fashion. As a consequence of the juxtaposition of two sets of recurring action-orientations, a distinct dynamic may occur, and additional patterned action may set a further dynamic into motion. Conjunctural interactions take place in both cases and qualitatively new causal thrusts arise. In this manner a distinct strengthening or weakening of regular action may occur; degrees of causal centrality - whether</page><page sequence="15">Max Weber'^ analysis of t/ze rise of monotheism 577 unimportant, facilitating or necessary - may change. At times kaleidoscopic alterations take place that lead to a dynamic fusing of heretofore separately unfolding patterns of action-orientations. Often fully unforeseen developments are called forth. Thus, Weber asserts throughout his substantive texts that empirical reality always implies a complex interaction of multiple past and present recurring action-orientations and the alteration of each as a consequence of this interaction. The prominence of conjunctural interaction in these texts requires a fundamental acknowledgement: if the presence of regular action is to be explained at the level of adequate causality, necessary synchronic and diachronic forces must not only be present and even not only present simultaneously; they must also interact in a 'correct' dynamic. To Weber: 'rrhe totality of all the conditions . . . [must] "actjointly" (zusammenzvirken) in a certain way and in no other if the concrete effect and no other is to be allowed to appear' (1949 187/289; emphasis in original, alt. trans.). Weber's causal methodology accords such conjunctural interactions a pivotal position.26 For him, contexts of multiple action-orientations create new interactions. Conjunctural interactions are central in his causal analysis of the rise of monotheism in ancient Israel. Historical changes in the era shortly before and during the First Exile had the effect of fusing together a constellation of action-orien- tations, and the dynamic interaction that resulted from this fusion gave birth to a genuine monotheism. Some of these patterns of action, heretofore latent, became manifest and powerful simply as a conse- quence of the new context called forth by such historical changes. The weakening powers of the United Monarchy, the renewal of warfare with colossal and seemingly invulnerable kingdoms, and the banish- ment of the Israelites into exile were most significant in this regard. Weber places a special emphasis upon a particular historical occur- rence: the historical accident that Isaiah's steadfast prophecy actually came to fulfillment - God would not permit Jerusalem to fall into the hands of the Assyrian hordes, if only the Judean king remained firm - provided the subsequently unshakable foundation for the position of this god and his prophets. (1968: 427/261) The decline of patrimonial-bureaucratic kingship with its hierarchi- cal command, officials, rent masters, army officers, specialized admin- istrators possessing prebends, and royal 'strategists' and scribes indicated a general demise of centralized control. Within this new, more open, milieu, missionary prophets could now more freely voice their warnings and appeals to the Israelites (1968: 418/257).27 Indeed, due to warfare, these great charismatic figures found good reason to intensify their pleas for obedience to Yahwe's commandments and a forsaking of false gods, if only because evil and warfare, according to</page><page sequence="16">578 Stephen Kalberg the be7zth, indicated Yahwe's dissatisfaction with his chosen people. The constant threat of warfare over several centuries and the declining prestige of the worldly rnonarchy not only brought about an aggrandizement in the power of these prophets, but also an ascend- ance of their god Yahwe to a newfound stature. Moreover, as their appeals grew more shrill, the memory of Moses and the sacred covenant, in part forgotten under the partnership of the kings, became paramount: 'The old right of the covenant and the import- ance of abiding by god's commandments as the condition of his favor forcefully reasserted themselves and stamped the hopes for the future' (1952: 120/129). Amidst warfare, decline, and even social chaos, the image voiced by the ethical prophets acquired a newfound urgency and credibility: the hallowed figure became the peaceful and devout peasant or shepherd of the Old Confederacy (1952: 224/239). Not surprisingly, the patrimonial bureaucratic kingdom of the United Monarchy became perceived as a 'defection from Yahwe, the real ruler of the people' (1968: 450/274). The advocacy of the old ideals and a return to the 'good old times' found a receptive hearing in that stratum severed from magical beliefs and practices and now less strictly dominated by patrimonial rulership: the urban plebeians. Increasingly, a knowledge of Yahwe's commandments became 'decisive for the worth and authority of the individual' (1952: 224/239). Indeed, according to Weber, a situation arose in which a plebeian stratum became the carrier of a religious ethic that emphasized ethical action. Yet even among intellectuals, the 'nomadic ideal', Yahwe's commandments and ethical action became central (1952: 224/229). To Weber: One of the secrets of the development of Yahwism lies . . . in the interaction between an enthused stratum of intellectuals and this public composed of demilitarized and socially declassed strata under the impact of social change during the time of the kings. (1952: 206/220) Out of this unique juxtaposition of past and present patterns of action a dynamic arose that called forth a genuine monotheism. Once having become constituted into a clear constellation of action-orien- tations, discrete regularities of action reciprocally and conjuncturally interacted with other action-orientations in such a fashion that all isolated thrusts toward monotheism became intensified. This great ethical God Yahwe - a god of the universe, all-mighty above all other deities, omniscient and omnipotent, ubiquitous and majestic- alone created the world and governs its history from beginning to end: 'The ancient warrior god of the confederacy, who had become the local god of the city of Jerusalem, took on the prophetic and universalistic traits of transcendently sacred omnipotence and inscrutability' (1968: 418- 19/257). And: 'The power of the god is enhanced into gigantic</page><page sequence="17">Max Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism 579 dimensions, into monotheism. He alone is the God of heaven and earth and none else (Deut. 4: 39). Heaven and earth and all is the Lord's (10: 14); the Lord is God, there is none beside him' (4: 35) (1952: 245/261). In sum, a broad spectrum of past and present regularities of action came together in a multivalent configuration in Weber's causal analysis of the rise of monotheism. A dynamic interaction of separate patterns of action constitutes the final critical stage in Weber's causal methodology. Such conjunctural interactions emphasize the crystalliz- ation of separate patterns of action within conducive contexts.28 This reconstruction of Weber's causal analysis of the rise of monotheism has relied, for guidelines, upon the three-stage causal methodology that Weber employs throughout his substantive texts.29 It distinguishes facilitating and necessary levels of causality, isolates synchronic and diachronic interactions of patterned action, and then defines conjunctural interactions of patterned action that occur within a context of patterned action. Utilization of this methodology has provided coherence to Weber's otherwise fragmented and poorly organized analysis. Whether the analysis reconstructed here will hold up against contemporary research remains a subject for further, and urgent, research.

All references to Weber's texts give the English translation first, then the page numbers of the original (^erman. The bibliography contains information regarding the latter. 2. This methodology is reconstructed in detail in Kalberg ( 1994). Only the most brief overview can be offered here. Also, the analysis reconstructed here of the rise of monotheism must be understood as a preliminary analysis. It rests exclusively upon Weber's causal methodology and omits the other central aspect of his mode of causal analy.si.s, namely the theoretical framework provided by his analytic treat- ise, Economy and Societ. A reconstruction that included reference to this theoretical framework would require a small book. Moreovers an examination of numerous purely methodological concepts would have to take place in such a f ull-scale reconstruction. See Kalberg ( 1994). 3. This three-volume study includes the volumes Ancient Judaism 1952), The Religion of C'hina ( 1951 ) and The Religzon of India (19523). 4. Weber's methodological in- dividualism implies that acting individ- uals and their 'action-orientations' are central. This term, as well as 'orientations of action' and 'patterns of action', will be utilized throughout. Even bureaucracies, Weber asserts, would simply vanish if groups of individuals did not orient their action in a specific, patterned and regular manner (e.g. towards the impersonal execution of statutes, the fulfilment of specialized tasks, the reliable perform- ance of tasks, and the hierarchy of authority). I do not see a disjunction in</page><page sequence="18">580 Stephen Kalberg this regal-cl between Weber'.s Ksubstantive and methodological writings, as do Rex ( 1971 ) ancl Turtler ( 1 9X 1).

The opposite of'schance', f'or hiln, is not sneces.sity' or .strong causality', but sad- equacy'.

Weber is more precise in Ec(vtlomy slnel S(vciety: sThe interpretation of' a sequence of' events will ... be called ssl2l.ssllEy adequate insof'ar as, according to established genetali7ations f'rom experi- ence, there is a probability that it will always actually occur in the same way.... Thus, causal explanatiotl depends on being able to determine that there is a probability, which in the rare ideal caise can be numerically stated, but is always in ksome sense calculable, that a given observable event (overt or subjective) will be accompaniecl by another event' (19623: 11-1'-?/5; emphasis in origitlal). See al.so 1949:230/179-X(), 164-6/'M66-23, 1 74-5/'-?76-7, 1 234-5/'-?236-7. 7. Weber also seeks to eliminate, through compariKsons, action-ot-ien- tations without causal Ksignificance. See Smelser ( 1 976: 141-9). 23. I am using the terms 'conjunctural' and 'dynamic' synonymously. 9. A comparison between (hina and the Middle East is undertaken in this volume in respect to 'princely adminis- tration' and the 'conception of' deity'. See Weber 1951: 20-30/2923-309. 10.

That the development of' monotheism wa.s not a consequence of' Yahwe's specific f'eatures is clear f'rom the f'act that thiKs god was also wor.shipped by the Bedouin and oasiis tribes outside Israel, yet never developed into their omniscient and omnipotent god (see 195'-?: 1'-?'-?/131). 11. Although Weber's Ancient Jucl.clism has been the subJect of' bt-oad commen- tary, I am not aware ofQstudieis that seek explicitly to reconKstruct his analysis of' the rise of'monotheism, and least of'all studies that attempt to do Kso by ref'erence to the causal methodology actually practised in his comparative-historical writingKs.

On the diverse social transf'orm- atiol1s that took place undet- the United Monarchy, see Weber 195'-?: 37144, 42-31 49-51, 461v54, 61/66, 99-1()0/1023-9, 11 5/ 124--t).

Weber believes that the f'ormation of' the Old (onf'ederacy was 'the most important instance in the history of' religion' (19623: 4123/256) . 16. Weber even states: 'Everything else f'ollowed f'rom the peculiarity of'the god of the covenant as well as of' the Levites in conjunction with certain historical cir- cu mstances' (1952: 241/257) .</page><page sequence="19">Max Weber's analysis ()f the rise ()f m()n()theism 581 1 7. See 1 952: 75/23 1 -2; 1 9623: 4 1 2- 1 3/ 253-4. The source of the distinction be- tween in-group and out-group morality for lewry and the prohibition against taking interest from 'a poor Israelite', for example, was originally a purely legal ex- pression of the ethic of brotherliness among neighbours and only later de- veloped into a religious commandment. See 1952: 64/69-70. Once this law ac- quired a religious sanction, only a short step separated it from the belief by con- federacy members in the 'joint religious liability . . . for the offenses of each in- dividual'. This belief, Weber argues, be- cause it justified the intervention of the confederacy in the private affairs of in- dividuals, strengthened the moral and . . . . . re lglous lnterpretatlon ot t e covenant laws and 'led to a specifically strong ethi- cal orientation of old Israelite confeder- ate law' (see 1952: 130- 1/136-7). 123. Weber uses the adjectives 'emis- sary', 'missionary', 'ethical' and 'scriptural' as synonyms for this type of prophecy. 19. Weber views the 'powerful ma- terial and ideological interests vested in priests' as the 'main reason' for the 'fail- ure of a consistent monotheism to de- velop in different cultures' (19623:419/ 257). 20. For this reason Weber's 'facilitat- ing' and 'necessary' patterns of action should not be understood as comparable to the common 'necessary and sufficient' usage today. Rather, his methodology re- mains non-linear and requires the elab- oration of a further distinct ingredient: . . . conJunctura Interactlon . 21. Weber never discusses, either in his methodological essays or in the 'Basic Sociological Terms' chapter (1968: 3-62/ 1-30), the significance of this concept in his comparative-historical writings. It has been extracted f rom his substantive texts. 22. 'Antecedent condition' (Voraussetz- ung), 'precedent' (Vorbedingung), and 'precursor' (Vorlaufer) will be used syn- onymously. The (^erman terms are often translated as 'prerequisite'. Because it implies a stronger and more direct causal link than Weber wishes to convey, this translation will not be employed here. Weber's notion of antecedent condition should not be confused with the struc- tural-functional notion of 'functional pre- requisite'. A few random examples from his texts will illustrate this aspect of his causal methodology. The educational system in patrimonial rulership, due to its . . . . . . stress upon administrative training, ac- counting, clerical work, and the training in law, formulated a precedent for the ideal of 'vocations that arose in the modern bureaucracy (1968: 1108/653) . Weber's sociology of law also offers vivid empirical examples. The formal qualities of Roman law and legal training provided precur- sors for patrimonial justice as well as, in combination with values associated with natural law, the development of a legiti- mizing framework of universalism for the modern epoch's bureaucratic rulership (1968: 853/491-2). Logical formal law, in articulating firmly the basic rights of man and providing fixed rules and legal techniques for business transactions as well as procedures for the enforcement of contracts, paved the way for 'the capitalist to use things and men freely', thereby assisting the rise of modern capitalism (1968: 667/398, 6231-3/407-23, 706/424, 1209/725-6). Finally, Weber cites the Enlightenment, carried by a status group of intellectuals. Its juxtaposition of the rights of man with a belief in individual reason not only established its opposition to patrimonial and feudal law, but also made it a precursor for the institutionaliz- ation of abstract norms in the legal sphere (1968: 1209/725-6). 23. Weber notes Yahwe's status at this time as involving 'a first approach to universalistic monotheism namely mono- latry' (1968: 418/256-7). 24. Such leaders are of ten viewed in the secondary literature on Weber as ap- pearing solely on the basis of personal features. 25. Weber provides a sociology of knowledge analysis of the Book of the (ovenant generally; see 1952: 61-89/66- 98. 26.
