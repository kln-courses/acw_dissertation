<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Animal-Style Art of Eurasia The Symbol of the Beast: The Animal-Style Art of Eurasia. By DAGNY CARTER. New York: Ronald Press Company, 1957. Plates, Map, Bibliog- raphy, Index. $8.50. For many years, archaeologists and art historians have been studying and writing about various phases of the animal-style art left by the ancient steppe peoples of Russia .and Central Asia as far as the northern borders of China. Since this work has tended to be highly specialized, and limited to distinct regions, a single study has been needed to pull together the results of their findings, in order to demonstrate the wide spread and essential unity of this long-continuing tradition and, if possible, to probe for its origins. This Mrs. Carter has attempted to provide in the present book, which is the result of her thirty years of enthusiasm for the subject. In a rather personal first chapter, she tells about the origin of her interest, on a visit to the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad in 1927, and her subsequent efforts to study this art in its many rami- fications, especially in the museums of Sweden and in China. In view of all this preparation, her book turns out to be rather disappointing. In the second chapter, entitled "Beast Symbolism," the author develops the theme that the extraordinary spread and wide distribution of the "Eurasian animal-style art," as she calls it, may be explained by the likelihood that the designs were not intended merely for decoration, but that they had their roots in early supernatural beliefs. She then embarks on a popularized, semi-anthro- pological discussion of sympathetic magic, totemism, and early Egyptian re- ligion, which gradually loses its scientific veneer as it becomes more farfetched. Thus she quotes from the Bible the commandment against the use of graven images as an example of an attack against beast symbolism.x Actually, it very clearly prohibits objects of worship, in solar, human, or animal form, but not symbolism as such. Otherwise, how could the ancient Hebrews have used com- posite beasts, such as were essential elements in the Near Eastern animal style of that time, to decorate the Temple of Jerusalem, even the most sacred Ark itself,2 as we now know they did? The chapter reaches a climax of obsession ~ The author quotes from Deuteronomy 4:16-19 and Exodus 20:45, in an effort to prove her point. ~ The cherubim were apparently a kind of winged sphinx, akin to those so frequently represented on Phoenician ivory carvings. Representations of these, together with other</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ARTICLES 233 with the suggestion that the portion of the vision of Ezekiel describing the four mystical creatures (quoted in extenso)3 may have been inspired by the prophet's having seen in Babylon some of the Luristan animal-style bronzes! The second chapter concludes with the statement that Eurasia's animal-style art, as she defines it, appears to have belonged to the illiterate, militant, and little-known group of mobile steppe people comprising the ancient Scythians and other associated tribes. This leads directly to a chapter on the arts of the Scyth- ians in South Russia, in which the author offers a partial reconstruction of their history and culture, with two quotations from a translation of Herodotus. The actual Scythian art-style is then analyzed, drawing the reader's attention to seeming parallels in Europe's palaeolithic cave art as revealed in the prehistoric bone carvings recovered in France. These parallels are frequently referred to (particularly on pp. 11, 30, 105, and 131), and although the author cites the hazards of trying to establish a connection, in view of the vast space of time separating them and the absence of "convincing intervening points," it seems obvious that she herself is impressed with the idea of a relationship. (As for the "striking parallel" illustrated in Plate 24, which shows a quilt from a grave in Outer Mongolia depicting a griffin attack an elk, compared with a wall carving of a solitary reindeer from a prehistoric cave in France, the pictures are, in reality, far from being close-in style, feeling, or representation-except that both happen to portray animals of the deer family.) After acknowledging a break of thousands of years following the palaeolithic carvings of Europe, the author tries to pick up the trail again with mention of an animal-combat motif found on an object from the tomb of Queen Shubad (d. ca. 2500 B.C., though the author wrongly places her in the previous millen- ium). Then she lists, as "the next manifestation of an animal art that appears to be related to the later Scythian," ornaments recovered by Schliemann in the last century among the grave finds at Mycenae. "How the animal-style orna- ments reminiscent of the later Scythian style art found their way to the tombs of the chieftains buried at Mycenae," she remarks, "is a problem that lies beyond the scope of this book." On this, we must take exception; the very crux of this book is the unresolved attempt to settle the question of the origins of the Scythian animal style, and here is a significant clue lightly dismissed. The animal designs on some of the Mycenaean ornaments and seals recovered by Schliemann are closely akin to the animal designs on the Mycenaean ivories, more recently discovered, on which designs of sphinxes, animal combats, etc., show close affinities with those of the ivory schools of Phoenicia and North Syria, and probably they were introduced to Mycenae from Northern Syria along with the ivory itself, which was apparently imported from there. Mrs. Carter natural symbols of trees and plants were apparently lavishly used in the decoration of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. See I Kings 6:23-35; Count Goblet d'Alviella, The Migration of Symbols, new ed. (New York, 1956), pp. 152-153; and R. D. Barnett, "Phoenician and Syrian Ivory Carvings," Palestine Exploration Quarterly (Jan. 1939), pp. 17-18. 3 Ezekiel 1:4-10.</page><page sequence="3">234 THE JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES never once mentions this very significant animal-style art of the ancient Near Eastern ivories. The people who have been most frequently associated with this work were the ancient Phoenicians, who, as traders and doubtless also as travel- ling artisans, carried their animal-style art on ivories and other objects in differ- ent materials as far as Spain in the west, and east to Assyria and probably to Urartu in Armenia. Their work was characterized by reliefs of sphinxes, griffins, and other composite beasts, apparently ultimately of Egyptian inspiration, to- gether with lions, bulls, and animals in combat, as illustrated by recent finds in Palestine and Assyria.4 The ivories were light and portable, as well as being highly regarded as treasures, and doubtless reached the lands occupied by the Scythians, in gifts or loot. Whether the patterns reached the Scythians on ivories actual examples of such ivories have been recovered in South Russia5-or whether the same subjects were transferred to metal by inspired metal smiths such as were found in ancient Urartu,6 certainly these ivory motifs must have had a great deal to do with inspiring the "Scythian animal style," and it seems unnecessary to look further back for the ultimate sources of the "Scythian pro- ductions." In any case it seems likely that these, from the beginning, were made for the Scythians by other peoples. It seems grotesque to speak of the warlike and predatory Scythians themselves as people of great artistic ability with fer- tile imaginations, as implied by the author (pp. 27-29, 36, and 113, etc.). Their only direct influence on the development of the animal-style art was prob- ably in the role of patrons, demanding designs to suit their own ideas and way of life and discarding others. It seems reasonable to suppose that the "Scythian" animal-style art could have arisen from the breaking down of the older Near Eastern animal style, as found on the ivory reliefs, into simpler forms, from which more and more was omitted in the way of balanced ornament and human and plant elements, that were not congenial to the steppe people, until they achieved designs consisting of mere heads or legs, or even parts of these, such as hoofs or beaks, thus finally getting back to simplifications which recall those on the palaeolithic bone carv- ings of prehistoric Europe. Meanwhile, closer observation of actual animals, on the part of the artists and the patrons who dictated the patterns, doubtless caused an abandonment of older heraldic and stylized forms and the recapturing of natural elements such as the palaeolithic European artists had discovered for themselves through their own keen observation. Also, the impulse which inspired the Phoenicians (like the Egyptians before them) to create composite creatures like the sphinx, apparently carried over into steppe art, leading to the contriving of new combinations from parts of more familiar beasts. Lastly, "characteristic 4 See G. Loud, The Megiddo Ivories, Chicago University Oriental Institute Publications, LII (Chicago, 1939), esp.

A less extreme evolution from older ivory patterns is apparent in the bronzes from Luristan (treated in Chapter 10), which may have developed out of the same ultimate sources, but along another line, perhaps via Elam; while the ob- jects in the Ziwiye7 Treasure (also discussed in that chapter) show a far more direct connection with the art of the Phoenician-Assyrian ivory workers, re- producing many motifs practically unchanged. The author points out several times (notably on pp. 154 and 168) that the discarded forms, such as balanced designs, heraldic figures, human and animal elements, etc., that were never fully assimilated into the steppe animal style, tended to reappear when changes brought about by new cultural, political, or religious conditions, began to modify the old "barbarian" way of life. In her fourth chapter, which is also devoted to Russian archaeology, she describes how just such a process apparently took place among the ancient peoples of the Perm region, in the foothills of the Urals, where an early symbolism involving human forms seems to have given way to the animal style, until, with the coming of Christianity, the strictly animal art was in turn succeeded by a renewed interest in anthropomorphism. From Perm and Anonino, the author moves on to describe the discoveries of animal-style art in the Minussinsk region of Siberia and in the famous tombs of the Altai area, notably those at Pazyryk. The latter are described quite graphi- cally, partly from reports of the Russian archaeologists, translated by a friend of the author. This leads to a brief consideration of the "Ordos bronzes" found in southern Inner Mongolia, on the northern borders of China, and a description of the tomb finds at Noin Ula, in Outer Mongolia, as having belonged to some of the "bearers of the Ordos ornaments." All these middle chapters (3-9) have more to say about archaeological discoveries, and attempted reconstructions of the history of the various steppe peoples who left no written history of their own, than about the art objects which are the author's chief interest. Unfor- tunately, they are not sufficiently detailed to satisfy either archaeologists or historians, but the references and bibliography do point the way to further reading. Chapter 10 departs from the main subject, that is the art of the Scythians with the closely associated animal-style arts found elsewhere on the steppes, and passes on to a consideration of the controversial bronzes from Luristan (which were not properly excavated and have never been satisfactorily dated), and the remarkable Ziwiye8 Treasure, also recovered in Iran about the same time, in the late 1920's. As mentioned above, the connection between these two Iranian groups and the animal-style objects from the steppes seems to be primarily one of similar initial inspiration in the earlier cultures of Mesopotamia and Syria, from which the Ziwiye examples had not yet branched off very far, while the 7Mrs. Carter uses an alternative spelling, writing it Zawiyeh. 8 See n. 7.</page><page sequence="5">236 THE JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES Luristan ones had apparently developed along a rather different line, acquiring certain typical and often unique characteristics of its own.9 The makers of the Ziwiye gold objects must have been highly sophisticated and civilized people, although the subject has been partly confused by the fact that the finders of the hoard also had for sale some ornaments of Scythian style, which may not have been found with them. All these considerations the author has apparently failed to recognize, and gropes to relate these groups to the preceding ones, without much success. Chapter 11, "Early Metallurgy in the Caucasus," is somewhat vague, and again seems rather irrelevant, especially as the author admits (p. 125) that the artistic representations on most of the objects found in the Caucasus excavations cannot be said to be related to "Eurasia's animal-style art." Again, more con- tinuity could have been achieved by mention of Urartu and its smiths, but the author seems obsessed by the idea that her animal art must have had steppe origins. Most irrelevant to what has preceded them, are the two succeeding chapters (12-13), devoted to the European area, which discuss the animal-style art of the Migration Period, and the Vendel and Viking styles of Old Scandinavia. Scholars have previously remarked that the latter two styles show great similarities to the ribbon-type style of the Late Chou and Warring States periods in China, several centuries earlier, though no direct connections have yet been proven, but they seem very far removed from the animal-style art of the steppes. While more synthesis is clearly needed at this time, to pull together the scattered work of individual scholars in the fields of Asiatic art and archaeology, still it would seem that with this European material, as well as with the Ziwiye Treasure, the author has gone too far to the opposite extreme, trying to draw too much into her net. The final chapter (14) restates the concept that the animal style eventually fell victim to new religious influences, and that through Buddhism in Asia and Christianity in Europe, "all civilizations" sooner or later replaced symbolic ani- mal forms with human figures of their new deities. The author stresses the fact that this movement took place more quickly in Asia and last of all in Northern and Western Europe, as her previous chapters had also shown. To evaluate this book more specifically, let us return to Chapters 7 and 8, dealing with the Ordos bronzes. These actually represent the heart and core of the book, because the small bronze castings from Inner Mongolia have been one of the chief sources of the author's interest in the animal style, both as objects of study and items for her personal collection. However, in these same chapters the weaknesses of the author's approach are especially obvious. We soon see that, in spite of her own collecting and her visits to museums around the world, the author has put too much uncritical reliance on the comments of others, including irresponsible Peking dealers, and when she cites authorities, their state- ments are often misquoted. 9 The most characteristic types of Luristan bronzes are well illustrated in Andr6 Godard, Les Bronzes du Luristan, Ars Asiatica, XVII (Paris, 1931). This book is not mentioned in Mrs. Carter's bibliography.</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW ARTICLES 237 In the first place, it is most naive to assume, as the author has done, that the descriptive name "Ordos" is either a precise geographical term, or an accurate statement of the locality in which the bronzes were found. It is merely a useful collective name. The term "Ordos" (or its Chinese equivalent, Ho-t'ao) is gen- erally used to refer not only to the "Ordos Desert" of our maps, confined within the northern loop of the present bed of the Yellow River, but rather to all that part of Inner Mongolia east and south of the Lang Shan range which edges the Gobi Desert (most of which territory was once confined within earlier beds of that shifting river). Also, it is commonly loosely used to refer to all the region between Kuei-hua and Ning-hsia City, up to and including the passes into the Gobi Desert, along which so many of these small bronzes have been found. When dealers in Kuei-hua and Pao-t'ou reported that the bronzes which they were selling came "from the west," they would not have meant from the "Ordos Desert" proper (which lay to the south of them), as the author claims, but meant rather that they came from the edge of the Gobi region, lying to the west of those towns. Actually many have been found right in the Gobi itself. Not only regionally, but also chronologically, the "Ordos bronzes" do not make as neatly compact a package as the author would imply. They cannot be so easily dated as coming "with few exceptions, from the Han dynasty, i.e., two centuries before and two after the birth of Christ." In addition to the likelihood that some of them may go back much earlier-as the author would apparently agree-they show a wide range of art motifs and symbols from different traditions and various times. Some of them bear patterns which are clearly T'ang (A.D. 618-906), while others, especially those depicting a "sea horse" galloping over the waves, must be as late as the Ming, perhaps only five hundred years old. In addition, the numerous modern forgeries, which were turned out by Chinese dealers as soon as foreign collectors began to show interest in this field, make the chronological problem still more complex. Since both the total distribution of the "Ordos bronzes" and their relative dating have been misrepresented, there seems little point in discussing minor misstatements based on false premises. However, there are still more serious faults to consider. The author has chosen to present this book with the outward trappings of scholarship, including long quotations indented in the text, foot- notes containing fuller references, and a bibliographical listing. (Unfortunately, the latter is not only incomplete, but is rather clumsily arranged, having the titles grouped according to references in chapters, instead of by a comprehensive alphabetical listing that would be easier to consult.) Yet scholarship is more than a matter of providing a bibliography and footnotes, and acknowledging quota- tions; it demands primarily a careful weighing of facts, and a rigorous checking and rechecking of all statements, especially quotations from others, partly to avoid misrepresenting them. In these more basic respects, this book is a mere travesty on scholarship. On the second page of Chapter 8 (p. 86), the author quotes Sowerby's mention of some of the animals which he recognized on the Ordos bronzes, citing his book, Nature in Chinese Art, without listing the page references. (None of her notes give page references.) Comparing her list with the original text, the scien-</page><page sequence="7">238 THE JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES tific name of every single animal mentioned has been miswritten. Sowerby him- self had made mistakes in two of them (his book was not very scientific, either'0), but she made further errors in the same names, having apparently copied them down in longhand, not bothering to recheck them before publication. The amended listing should read: The wild horse (Equus przewalskii Poliakoff) The Kiang, or Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus Pallas) The two-humped Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus L.) The ibex, Mongolian form, (Capra sibirica hagenbecki Noak) The argali, or wild sheep (Ovis ammon mongolica) and (on p. 87), "The Blue Sheep, or burhel (Psuedois nahoor)." This garble is soon followed (p. 87) by a quotation from an article by J. G. Andersson. The accompanying footnote gives the correct volume number of the journal in which it appeared (BMFEA), but the wrong year (it was 1932, not 1934); and when one finally locates the original passage, in spite of the false lead and the absence of page notation, one finds that it is not a direct quotation at all. Parts of the original have been omitted with no admission of the fact, and sentences have been transposed or rewritten differently. The word "bull" has been miswritten "hull," and the name "Sika deer" has been run together as a single word." In Chapter 9 there are two quotations from an article by Professor Karlgren (pp. 102-103). Again, the footnote refers one to a wrong year (it should be 1945, not 1948). In the first quotation the author has taken the liberty of altering the romanization of the key name, Hsiung-nu, in order to make it conform with the spelling given in her own text; but she failed to alter the other romanized words to accord with this different system, so the quotation as printed has two forms of romanization for the Chinese names, inconsistent with each other, and gives the false impression that the original writer was responsible for the inconsistency. The second passage, also presented as a quotation, turns out to be merely a highly condensed paraphrasing of the original text. Such errors and liberties with the statements of others are by no means con- fined to these two key chapters. On p. 113, there is a quotation from an article by Charles K. Wilkinson, said to have come from the Metropolitan Museum Bulletin for April 1955. (The article was not in that issue, but turned up in the March one for that year.) Here again, the wording has been somewhat altered, and the key word, lamassu, has been misspelled. It seemed futile to check all the "quotations" in view of the difficulties provided by faulty and incomplete references; however, the second quotation from Raw- linson's translation of Herodotus (pp. 25-26) had several sets of dots such as are conventionally used to indicate deletion of words or phrases, and the reviewer looked it up to see what had been omitted. It turned out that, in all but one case, the sign of ellipsis had been inserted to replace simple dashes in the original 10 See the writer's review of his book in Natural History, XLVII (March 1941), 179. 11 Dr. Andersson had hyphenated this name, but it is properly written as two separate words.</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS 239 translation; while several words had actually been suppressed elsewhere with no indication of the fact. Similarly, some words had been deleted from the first quotation taken from Rawlinson's Herodotus (on p. 25) without acknowledging it. The book has a number of minor errors. Abb6 Huc (referred to on p. 126) did not spell his name with a k. "Comb" is twice used in describing griffins (p. 67), where "crest" seems the proper word. The word "arrows" is repeated several times on p. 85, at least in the second case referring only to arrowheads. In de- scribing the tattooed fish on p. 70, the term "wattles" has been misused for "barbels." On the last line of p. 75, "scriptures" has apparently been miswritten for "sculptures." The illustrations make an excellent supplement to the text, as they should in this kind of book; but although they are numerous, they are not always clearly presented. Furthermore, there is no indication of scale on the individual plates to indicate the relative size of the objects, so that tiny castings, such as belt fittings, and very large ones, such as knives and axe-heads, are presented as though they were practically the same size. Also, it would have been far more convenient for the reader if the plate credits on pp. 195-196 had simply been printed with the captions, on the plates to which they referred. Lastly, the description on Plate 12 (p. 80) describes Fig. 12a as a "hornblend ornament" (perhaps meaning made of hornblende?), while the text (on p. 64) states that it was made of staghorn. This book clearly demonstrates the need for a proper scholarly synthesis of all the existing knowledge regarding the animal-style art of Asia, beginning with the Ancient Near East. In the meantime, it can perhaps help to interest new readers in the fascinating subjects of the old Asiatic steppe cultures and the numerous cross-cultural interrelationships between the nomads and the settled peoples of the great civilizations.
