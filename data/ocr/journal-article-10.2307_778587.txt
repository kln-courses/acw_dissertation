<plain_text><page sequence="1">Address to the Heathen Questions of Cinema, by Stephen Heath, Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1981. NOEL CARROLL I. Introduction The history of film theory reads like a history of modern thought: since the 1920s several major conceptual frameworks for film analysis have successively developed and declined. Compared to the literature of an ancient art such as dance, this surprisingly extensive body of theoretical literature has been gener- ated for film, in part, because of the fight this medium has had to wage for its very legitimation as an art and as an object worthy of serious study. In the '70s, one position emerged from this welter of theories with some claim to provi- sional consideration as dominant. This position is an amalgam of Lacanian psychoanalysis, Althusserian Marxism, and the textual analysis of Roland Barthes, with a commitment to feminism. Since the latter part of the decade, this position has commanded more attention and exposure than any other in serious film journals. Interestingly enough, cinema studies is an area of academic inquiry in which Marxism and psychoanalysis are regarded as estab- lished, mainstream methodologies. It is within this context that Questions of Cinema assumes its present significance, for its author, Stephen Heath, is a prominent representative of this approach to cinema within the English- speaking world, and his book is likely to become a standard text in this country.1 In the later '60s and early '70s, European film theory was preoccupied with the application of semiological method to the study of film. The leading figure in this enterprise was Christian Metz, and the work of Saussure pro- 1. My discussion of Heath is offered as a questioning of the adequacy of his theory as theory. Others have also questioned the viability of the Althusserian-Lacanian approach as Marxism; see especially Kevin McDonnell and Kevin Robins, "Marxist Cultural Theory," in One-Dimensional Marxism, London, Allison and Busby, 1980. Questions about the degree to which Heath's theory is acceptable as psychoanalysis are beginning to be raised as well; see David Will, "Questions of Heath," in Framework, no. 18 (1982). Feminists, I suspect, may also want to object to Heath's ver- sion of feminism. In this essay I leave these questions aside.</page><page sequence="2">OCTOBER vided its methodological base. According to Heath, Saussurean linguistics was, in certain respects, too limited for the needs of film study; it was insensitive to questions of ideology. The move from linguistics to psychoanalysis as the framework for film theory was dictated by the desire to deal with the way in which ideology functions both within and through film. Questions of Cinema is an attempt to create a psychoanalytically informed film theory that will explain the way in which the practices of narrative commercial cinema implement the production and reproduction of ideology. Heath holds a rather special theory of ideology, together with a special theory of psychoanalysis, in which Marxism and psychoanalysis mesh-at least on paper. The theory of ideology is that of Louis Althusser, according to which capitalism must reproduce itself in order to sustain itself. This involves not only the replacement of depreciating machinery, but also of the labor force. More- over, the labor force - indeed, the entire population of a capitalist state -must not only be physically reproduced; it must also be reproduced socially; that is, society must be reproduced in such a way that the roles, values, and even the metaphysics requisite for capitalism remain relatively stable from generation to generation. The function of ideology is to reproduce itself; this means its func- tion is to reproduce capitalist subjects. The ambiguity of the word subjects here is crucial. For Althusser, it refers both to one's belief in oneself as a unity, an autonomous "I," the center of one's own experience; and to one who is subservi- ent to some system of domination. It is at this point that psychoanalysis enters the picture. For the psychoanalysis endorsed by Althusser and Heath-that of Jacques Lacan-is identified as a discipline that studies subject construction. Thus, the analytical categories of Lacanian psychoanalysis are marshaled to describe the different phases and dynamic interrelations that result in subject construction. What has this to do with film? Film is a means of propagating ideology, or a means through which ideology functions, that is, produces sub- jects. To study film's ideological operation is to examine the ways it constructs subjects. To this end, Heath analyses certain elements of film--the mimetic image, narrative construction, editing, sound, and so forth-to explicate how these elements have been employed in order to facilitate subject construction. Furthermore, the interaction of these elements with spectators is characterized in Lacanian terms, since that type of psychoanalysis presumably supplies us with the best analytical categories for dealing with subject construction.2 2. Here I am offering an interpretation of what I take Heath's motives to be. Heath begins Questions of Cinema with an account of what he believes is the relation between Marxism, psycho- analysis, and the ideological study of film. This is an exercise in wool-gathering. Heath wrenches Marx's metaphor of the camera obscura and Freud's metaphor of the photographic negative out of context to tell us how film brings psychoanalysis and Marxism together. Perhaps partly as the result of the influence of Marcuse, Marxists in the '70s became inter- ested in the usefulness of psychoanalysis to Marxist theory. For example, in Alienation (New 90</page><page sequence="3">Address to the Heathen Like the majority of classical film theorists, Heath does not give his read- ers the argumentative justifications for the basic philosophical presuppositions in his book. He assumes readers who are familiar with, understand, and agree with the basic tenets of the Lacanian-Althusserian position. Before examining Questions of Cinema in detail, therefore, one must consider some of the unargued metaphysical, sociological, and psychoanalytic premises that rule the text. Heath's basic premise is that the prime function of ideology is to construct subjects. (This process is also known as positioning or"interpellating" subjects.) Ideology has various means -institutions and structures, called apparatuses - to this end. These include not only government with its laws, courts, and police, but also the educational system, religion, the arts, and so forth. These ideologi- cal apparatuses are not mere bodies of ideas; they are modes of address. They have a discursive component, and it is through this discourse that subjects are constructed. How does this happen? To understand this, we must start with a distinc- tion between the individual-the human organism, a biological, numerically distinct entity-and a subject-a socially constructed identity which is less than the sum of all the properties of the numerically distinct entity. This entity ac- quires an identity - becomes a subject - by being addressed by an institution or apparatus in a certain way. Consider this heuristic example: I get a letter from the Internal Revenue Service that says, "Dear Mr. Carroll, Please appear at our New York Office to explain your deduction of $3,000 for moviegoing on your 1977 taxes." The IRS is implicitly addressing me as a subject of a specific sort, viz., as a taxpayer (rather than, say, as a rhapsodizer of the film Airplane). The discourse, in this case the letter, determines what I am within this situa- tion, that is, what my relevant role and response should be. This process is interpellation-the letter addresses me in a certain way; it requires that I react as a certain kind of subject in terms of a specific role or position. The subject is characterized by the address; the subject is said thereby to be constituted or constructed by (or in) the discourse, or to be positioned by (or in) the discourse. Moreover, this aspect of interpellation is held to be a dimension of all ideology, since all ideology has a discursive component; it is always addressed to concrete individuals3 who are then transformed into concrete subjects (subjects with a certain position). Lest my modest tax example be deceptive, it is important to pause to spell York, 1971), Bertell Oilman criticizes Marxism for its lack of psychology. Oilman, however, does not turn to Lacan to fill in this gap, but to Reich; see also Social and Sexual Revolution, Boston, South End Press, 1979. I mention Oilman to point out that even among Marxists who feel the need to embrace psychoanalysis, there is no consensus about what sort is correct in terms of the overall theory of Marxism. 3. This is not strictly accurate. For Althusser and Heath, ideology always addresses already interpellated subjects, that is, subjects who have already been affected by previous address. 91</page><page sequence="4">OCTOBER out the extremely wide scope of the preceding demonstration. All ideology has a discursive component, an address; therefore, every instance of ideology func- tions to position a subject, thereby reproducing a condition for the reproduc- tion of capitalism. Three things worth noting in this story are: (1) The concept of ideology at issue is much broader than usual; the constitution of a subject, of identity, is ordinarily ascribed to a culture (which may or may not be ideologi- cal in nature). What is called ideology in this analysis has the proportions of what would normally be called a culture. (2) The realm of what is discourse has become quite extensive, encompassing almost every phenomenon of civilized life; my T-shirts, insofar as they are mine, in virtue of the institution of private property, have a discursive dimension which, I suppose, warns you not to wear them. (3) Subjects are being produced (positioned, constructed) by virtually every unit of discourse.4 We might think of this by saying that just as every piece of discourse performs some illocutionary act, it also has the perlocution- ary effect of positioning its receiver as a subject.5 When thinking of examples like my IRS letter, it is easy to picture this perlocutionary effect because we can name the purported subject position by a well-defined social role. But when a radio announcer proclaims "It's 1:00 P.M.," one wonders what the accompany- ing subject position might be. Where the discourse can be defined as address- ing an individual in terms of a social role, one can grasp the Althusserian point and perhaps even concede that it has some ideological or political relevance. But what of cases of discourse that do not appear to stipulate a readily identifi- able social role for their prospective receivers? To answer this, we must assume that the subject may be positioned not only as a nameable role but as a formal unity. That is, coherent discourse, in- telligible discourse-for example, "It's 1:00 P.M."-has the force of manipulat- ing the individuals who understand it into believing that the unity and coher- 4. The virtually here is to acknowledge that Althusser, at least, seems to allow that scientific discourse might in some sense be subjectless, though the text is incomplete on this point; see his "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses," in Lenin and Philosophy, trans. Ben Brewster, New York, Monthly Review Press, 1971, p. 171. 5. Heath denies that his analyses are causal ones but then goes on to offer causal analyses. For example, the concept of the "causation of the subject" is used explicitly throughout the text. Also, Heath speaks of cinema machines and the cinematic apparatus and this sounds causal to me. Moreover, his concept of contradictions seems to be causal, since contradictions are treated as compelling forces that produce states of affairs. Heath criticizes causal analyses by noting that searching for cause-effect relations is like believing that solving questions of historical materialism is easier than solving an equation in the first degree. I don't understand his point: does this mean that the phenomena under investigation involve more variables than an equation in the first degree? No one has ever claimed that cause- effect relations can only be analyzed by equations in the first degree. Heath's need for more so- phisticated mathematical tools than equations of the first degree does not show that his analyses or the phenomena they investigate are not causal. I am not sure that Heath understands his own argument, for his grasp of mathematics at other points in the book is pretty shaky-witness his endorsement of an absurd foray into the foundations of arithmetic by Jacques-Alain Miller (p. 84). 92</page><page sequence="5">Address to the Heathen ence of the discourse is a property of themselves as subjects. Individuals are constituted or constructed as unified subjects from the outside, so to say.6 In this theory, the relevant outside independent variable is discourse. Discourse addresses the individual as a unified subject, and the individual mistakes the intelligibility, unity, and coherence of the discourse and its address as its own unity of self. The important presuppositions here are that (1) the belief in the unified subject is false, that is, in some sense the individual is not a unity; (2) this false experience of unity is a result of misrecognition; the individual appre- hends the apparent coherence of the discourse and its address but wrongly at- tributes it to himself as a unified, self-determining, autonomous, homogeneous subject/agent; (3) the myth of subject unity and the construction of unified sub- ject positions are ideological operations because the perpetuation of capitalism requires the belief in the unified subject, and unified subject/agents. Lacanian psychoanalysis presumably plays an indispensable explanatory role in this theory by providing an account of the psychic mechanism that underlies the occurrence of misrecognition--the mistaking by the individual of the apparent unity of the discourse for his own unity as a subject. The mecha- nism is called the Imaginary. Its origins are believed to reside in the earlier stages of our psychosexual development. This process culminates in our first experience of ourselves as individuated entities and is designated the "mirror stage." The external reflection of our image in the mirror gives us our first sense of wholeness and unity as an entity numerically distinct from other objects and persons. What is important in this is that our sense of self arrives from the out- side, from the Other. In this respect the mirror experience can be seen as repre- senting more than a single event. Rather, it summarizes the totality of our con- stitutions as individuals, shaped, as it were, from the outside (parents, society, and so on). We distinguish ourselves as selves versus others. But in fact we are constituted by the Other. This represents an originary contradiction (where contradiction is understood as designating a property of a state rather than a property of an argument). Our mirror stage experience of wholeness and indi- viduality ironically arrives from the Other; thus, our belief in our unified, autonomous self as opposed to the Other is based on an extrapolation from the intuition of an outside unity. We are not autonomous but products of the Other; we are not unified subjects but composite organisms with roiling and conflicting drives, instincts, 6. The vocabulary and problematic of the Lacanian-Althusserian position are very Hegelian. Without accepting the Hegelian reconciliation of self and Other in the Absolute, Lacanian Marx- ists adopt the Hegelian characterization of the relation of the self and the Other; e.g., consider Hegel's "I am a being for itself which is for itself only through another. Therefore the Other penetrates me to the heart. I cannot doubt him without doubting myself, since self-consciousness is real only insofar as it recognizes its echo in another." See especially the section entitled "Self- Consciousness" in The Phenomenology of Mind in order to grasp the importance of Hegelian think- ing for Lacanian-Althusserianism. 93</page><page sequence="6">OCTOBER and desires. Yet through the Imaginary we construct a mythic inner self, unified and sui generis, which is a metaphysical illusion masking the fact that we are both heterogeneous complexes and products of the Other. The Imagi- nary continues to operate through later developmental stages, and it functions to transform apparent external unities into confirmations of the illusion of self- unity. Since these external unities are themselves only apparent, the Imaginary is also the mechanism through which illusions of external unity are appre- hended (or, rather, misapprehended) as unities. The apparent coherence or unity of a movie, for example, produces the illusion of subject-unity in a spec- tator which, in turn, supports the persuasiveness of the illusion that the movie is unified. The Imaginary is the mechanism that responds to apparent external unity by producing illusions of subject-unity, which enhance the illusions of ex- ternal unities. At this stage of exposition, it is useful to note the extraordinary variety of the apparent external unities that the Imaginary can use to project subject- unity. These extend from whole bodies to meaningful utterances; they include coherent films and aesthetically "unified" artworks. One wonders how these infinitely different stimuli can function in the same way as inputs in the causal system of subject construction. It would seem to be the vagueness and lack of specificity of the concept of unity in this account that is allowing its proponent to treat things as dissimilar as bodies and sentences as if they were functionally equivalent. The only connection is a verbal one; we call whole bodies unified in virtue of their continuity within the limits of their contour; coherent utterances are unified in virtue of their meaningfulness; a piece of music may be unified because of a recurring theme. Despite the fact that we may use the same word to speak of all three things, we are nevertheless discussing three different kinds of things. Once we undertake to describe them less amorphously, we must ask how such disparate causes manage to evoke the same effect, that is, why and how the mirror experience moves from projecting subject-unity on the basis of intuiting the reflection of a complete body to doing so on the basis of witnessing some point-of-view editing in a narrative film. In short, we need a further mechanism to explain the mechanism of the Imaginary, unless the latter has only been fabricated through the equivocation of the word unity. That is, there is no reason to assume that everything we are willing to call unified shares the same causal potential for the Imaginary. Moreover, if we say that the Imagi- nary is able to use all these different unities to project subject-unities because these different things all have the common property of self-identity, then we have traveled in a circle, since it is the Imaginary that is supposed to explain how things are grasped as self-identifiable entities. It is thus somewhat embar- rassing to invoke the principle of identity to explain how the Imaginary works. And, of course, it is being assumed that these external stimuli are not truly homogeneous entities anyway, so how would something like a principle of identity be of any use whatsoever? 94</page><page sequence="7">Address to the Heathen Heath does not provide us with anything like proof of the preceding theo- retical framework. Rather he asserts it, though not in the most perspicuous manner. Nevertheless, his analysis of film requires all this machinery if it is to succeed. The bulk of the text is occupied with showing the manner of operation of the formal devices of commercial narrative cinema: editing, camera move- ment, plotting, and so forth. This is a question of demonstrating how they comport themselves as apparent, coherent unities. Once these devices are said to project an illusion of unity, Heath repeats the Lacanian account of the way in which this causes subject-unity. When a device is described abstractly enough for nomination as a unity, the same story of subject construction is in- voked. This means that most of the book is devoted to repetitiously rehears- ing its laws of Lacanian subject construction. Psychoanalytic description, rather than what one would customarily identify as political criticism, domi- nates the text. Given Heath's presupposition as to the ideological significance of subject construction, however, this psychoanalysis is, by definition, political analysis. (Many Marxist film scholars might dissent on this point.7) Through- out Questions of Cinema, Heath also examines styles of filmmaking that present alternatives to the dominant, commercial narrative style, and he remarks on their consequences for subject construction, ideology, and political emancipation. Despite the novelty of Heath's philosophical and psychoanalytic sources, the outline of his theory approximates the structure of most traditional aca- demic film theories.8 His central task is the analysis of the commercial narra- tive cinema. He identifies the role of this cinema as the maintenance of ideol- ogy through the construction of subjects. In light of this role, film's determinant characteristic is its capacity to promote illusions of unity on the screen, which, in turn, provoke subject-unities. His analytic energies are then turned to a case-by-case review of various articulatory processes of the commercial nar- rative cinema to show how its various devices and their combination engender illusions of unity. Structures such as sync sound dialogue are examined for the way in which they exemplify his determinant characteristic of film. Heath's 7. The Marxist argument holds that the abstractness of Lacanian subject construction is ahistorical; it depicts a formal unity that is difficult to connect with any specificity to concrete historical developments. In this theory, what is the difference in the subject constitution of a medieval serf, a nineteenth-century German factory worker, and a white, middle-class, junior vice-president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust? Heath is aware of this charge on his left flank and often urges the importance of specific historical analyses. He never provides, however, a full- blown example of what he has in mind as an adequate, historically sensitive case study. This is an especially striking oversight; for, given the abstractness of Heath's psychology, the historical task has no readily perceptible means of proceeding under the aegis of his Lacanian generalities. Thus, one may not only chide Heath's failure to provide an example in terms of a failure to show how the Marxist analyst is to proceed, but also in terms of a failure to show that he can in fact proceed to concrete historical studies of subject construction while using the Lacanian conceptual framework. 8.

Though Heath leaves the presuppositions of his Lacanian-Althusserian framework unexamined, responsible readers cannot. I cannot show that all the formulations of the Lacanian-Althusserian line are irretrievably mistaken. But many are questionable enough and their central concepts so ill-defined that the burden of their proof can be shifted back to their proponents. The most glaring problem of the analytic framework is that its concept of ideology is too broad. By identifying ideology with subject construction, the concept has become roughly coextensive with that of a culture, and the term thus loses its pejorative force. Ordinarily we do not want our ideas and our thinking corrupted by ideology. For if a belief is ideological, that implies that it is (1) false and (2) that it is a rhetorical tenet of some practice of social domina- tion-for example, "All black men want to rape white women." 9 Not all the be- liefs enunciated or presupposed by a culture are ideological in this way. More- over, it is self-defeating for a Marxist to employ such an overblown concept of ideology, since Marxism proposes to found a culture which under this ap- proach will be ideological. Every community will have to have a culture. The negative force of ideology will be lost, however, if every conceivable culture must be ideological. There will be no point in extricating ourselves from ideology if we do so only at the price of entering a new ideology, especially where that new ideology engages in the same "tyrannical" process of subject construction. Whereas, when the idea of ideology is connected with practices of demonstrably avoidable domination where the beliefs in question are lies and falsehoods, one clearly feels the negative pressure of the charge "ideology" and is thereby moved to dissociate oneself from what is ideological. The hortatory force of ideology is lost when ideology becomes culture, since the critical sense of the concept requires us to disavow ideology, while it is impossible (and politi- cally unnecessary) to disavow all culture. The preceding observations are related to the question of the usefulness of the idea of the ideological construction of subject-unity. It is held that every bit of discourse enjoins a subject position. In Heath's hands, this focuses analysis on what might be thought of as relatively small sets of phenomena-camera movements, cutting patterns, the narrative structures of whole films. He pro- vides moment-by-moment recitations of how, with each device, the projection of coherence results in the construction of subject-unities. The fluctuation of these momentary subject positions is said to be interminable, and Heath's role is to stress the factors of perturbation and equilibrium in this process. I will discuss the interminability thesis later. But for the present, I would merely like 9. I discuss broad and narrow conceptions of ideology in film studies in my "From Real to Reel: Entangled in Nonfiction Film," in Philosophical Exchange (forthcoming Fall 1983). 96</page><page sequence="9">Address to the Heathen to point to the awkwardness that the category of subject-address entails insofar as it predisposes an analyst to offer micro-descriptions of the subject-unity con- structions that accompany every bit of discourse. It is no accident that the notion of subject-address commits one to blow- by-blow accounts of the way in which each discursive unit provokes subject- unity construction, since the key claim for the importance of the discovery of subject-address is that every piece of discourse has a subject position-some- thing that had hitherto gone unremarked. Research, therefore, proceeds by isolating and explaining the formation of these positions. But will this method ever succeed in illuminating the kind of ideological subjects that are relevant to social analysis? Let us make a rough, pragmatic distinction between two kinds of subjects: the occurrent, unified subjects constructed on a moment-to-moment basis by the interpellating discourse, and stable subjects, subjects with, among other things, personality profiles that remain relatively intact over long periods of time. An obedient worker, a misogynist, a bigot, and a bureaucrat are ex- amples of what I am calling stable subjects. Ideological analysis would surely be concerned primarily with the creation of these sorts of stable subjects. But it is hard to see how we are to get from the construction of momentary subject- unities to stable ideological subject/agents of the type just listed. It is an act of faith rather than of science to believe that these momentary constructions amount to particularized, stable, ideologically instilled subject/agents. What are the patterned variables and regularities that transform momentary subject- unities into stable ideological subjects? Heath describes a battery of subject constructions, but it is impossible to see how these combine into ideologically mystified agents with the inclination to uphold practices of social domination. The idea of ideological address describes its almost formal subject-unities, but it does not explain the formation of ideological agents. One way to appreciate the force of the preceding charge is to note that though I may be addressed ideologically, and though I may understand that address as a coherent utterance - for example, "Unions are by their very nature anti-democratic"-I may reject the utterance. Or, to take an example from film, I may resist the heroic portrait of the KKK in The Birth of a Nation. These examples show that I am not the simple, reflex effect or imprint of every coherent signifier. But how do these resistances happen? And what are the differentia between being positioned as a believer-unity of an ideological ad- dress and as a disbeliever-unity? An answer to this might begin to establish the relation of occurrent subject construction and stable ideological subjects, but neither Althusser nor Heath provides us with many hints in this direction. At the very least, this suggests that address and subject-unity construction sim- pliciter are not particularly useful concepts for supplying us with an analysis of the formation of ideological agents. The animus of my objection here is not essentially political. I am not saying that the problem is that the concept of subject-unity is not helpful for revolutionary praxis (though probably it isn't). 97</page><page sequence="10">OCTOBER Rather my point is logical. That is, the concept of subject-address falls short of what it ostensibly promises to explain-the creation of ideological agents. A major assumption of Althusser's adopted by Heath is that subject-unity construction, in and of itself, is negative. On the face of it, this seems an unlikely premise. For if the problem of subject-unity construction is that it secures a necessary condition for further ideological operations-for example, for the creation of ideological agents-then it must be admitted that subject- unity construction also appears to afford a necessary condition for individuals to adopt emancipatory roles, to become revolutionary agents. Am I not inter- pellated by "Workers of the world unite!" and wouldn't the subject-unity im- parted by the coherence of that text become a condition for revolutionary agency? If this is so, then how can subject-unity constitute a special problem apart from the problem of the specific kind of role-agency with which it is, in fact, correlated? That is, the theory's negative attitude toward the construction of subject-unities is unmotivated unless a persuasive account is offered of the way revolutionary agents are constituted without presupposing subject-unity construction. It is of no theoretical value to say that true revolutionary agents are or will be constituted differently from those of capitalism; an adequate theory must portray the why and the wherefore of this. Althusser provides an argument for the negative attitude toward subject- unity construction: "The individual is interpellated as a (free) subject in order that he shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject, i.e., in order that he shall (freely) accept his subjection, i.e., in order that he shall make the gestures of his subjection 'all by himself."' 10 Here is a statement of determinism with respect to subject-address. We might call it discourse determinism, wherein the subject is an effect of the discourse (of the signifier). Such a posi- tion is fraught with the difficulties of determinism plus some of its own making. Those of its own making derive from the primacy of place that it accords dis- course; the postulated causal nexus between subject position followed by sub- jection is implausible. Hearing does not necessitate believing, let alone comply- ing. If subject-address has causal efficacy, how does it connect up with the individual's conative network? Also, what of the common experience of reject- ing what we are told? Unless we get an explanation of these cases that fits with the rest of discourse determinism, then we have no reason to believe that we are always subjected by interpellation. It may be urged that whenever I reject one subject-address, it is because I have already been positioned by an earlier, con- tradictory subject-address. But why do I choose one among rival subject- addresses? Can an account be given of that which decisively precludes all free action on the part of the individual? Furthermore, if it is argued that the indi- vidual is unfree because he is initially an empty organism shaped completely by 10. Althusser, p. 182. 98</page><page sequence="11">Address to the Heathen some discourse, then it would seem that the definition of freedom is too ex- treme. It amounts to the claim that the only free individual would be sui generis. But the relevant idea of freedom is based on a belief that agents can do otherwise and not that they ultimately create themselves. As Althusser's argument indicates, one of the grounds for the negative at- titude toward subject-unity construction is that it involves an illusion: I believe I am freely acting when I am only being acted upon by ideology. This formula- tion seems to ride on a specious notion of free action. There is, however, another, related illusion that the theory attributes to subjects: I believe that I am unified, but in fact I am a construction. Several problems with the putative illusion arise here. First, unity and construction are not mutually incompatible terms. The George Washington Bridge is unified, and it was and is a construc- tion. Thus, the fact that someone believes x is unified does not preclude the belief that x is a construction. Also, the fact that a subject believes he is a unified subject does not entail that he holds the supposedly false belief that he is not a construction. Furthermore, I may truly believe that I am a unity and yet be unaware of the process by which I was constituted. The belief in subject- unity, in other words, does not, on its own, suggest any false or illusory beliefs about whether or not the individual believes himself to be a construction. Of course, an agent may believe both that he is a unity and that he is not a con- struction. But it does not seem to be commonly believed, in either modern capitalist or socialist society, that individuals are not constructions. Nurture, environmental conditioning, behavioral modification as well as the admission that people change over time are commonplaces rather than secrets in contem- porary industrial society. That is, if it is a common belief that people are unities under capitalism, that belief is conjoined with the logically compatible belief that people are, in various respects, constructions.11 11. There is an analogous argument current in academic film writing which is applied to films rather than subjects. It is held that when audiences perceive films as unified, they are deceived because the film is really a production. This argument involves the ambiguity of the word produc- tion. It suggests both a process and a finished product. Film theorists claim that by presenting itself as a finished product, the film effaces the fact that it was made by a process, thereby offering itself as a natural artifact or event. The film is not a unity because the process of production has been deleted from its final representation. But since there is no contradiction between the two senses in which a film is a production -a film is a process of production before its release and a product at the time of its release- there is no reason to postulate that it must efface one of these conflicting facts. There is no reason to deny that the film is a unified production because its pro- cess of production is not represented in the product-production. When speaking of unified films, the sense of production as process is irrelevant. Supposedly, commercial narrative films are illusions because they mask the fact that they are the result of a process of production. Audiences accept such films as natural unities because the fact that these films result from processes of production is masked. This argument flies in the face of even casual observation. People do not mistake films for actual chains of events. The whole institution of film-with its emphasis on stars, the acquisition of new properties, etc. -is based on the audience's knowledge that films involve processes of production. 99</page><page sequence="12">OCTOBER Since the conjunction of a belief in subject-unity and subject construction is not necessarily contradictory, the source of falsity or illusion in the belief in subject-unity must lie elsewhere. The idea of subject construction is the main discovery of the theory. Therefore, the belief in subject-unity must be the rele- vant false belief. The theory must, at this point, offer some compelling argu- ments to demonstrate the falsity of the individual's confidence in being a unified subject. The attack on the belief in personal identity is longstanding in philosophy; it has been advanced by Hume12 and Nietzsche. 3 In the context of the Althusserian position, the unity of the subject is denied for apparently two reasons. First, it is believed that there is no subject, unified or otherwise, because the self is always the production of the Other. We are constituted from the outside. We are not unified, since not all the causes of our decisions are in- ternal to us. Effectively, this implies that the self, or anything worth (metaphys- ically) calling the self, would have to be sui generis. But this entails defining the self out of existence; of course, we are left with only the Other. Nevertheless, one wants to know whether we've got hold of a problem with the self or a prob- lem with the definition. Concepts like self, subject, and autonomy play a range of descriptive and explanatory roles in everyday language, and in scientific and moral theories. They are applied to a cluster of phenomena to which they refer. But being sui generis does not appear to be a necessary condition for their ap- plication. I may make an autonomous decision to become a lawyer, but this does not require that I have invented the legal institution any more than my decision not to steal requires that I wrote the Ten Commandments. I inherited the possibility of making these decisions from the Other but that does not entail that I do not behave freely and autonomously. The error of the Althusserian position seems to lie in proceeding from the correct recognition that the self cannot possibly be totally disjunct from the Other, to a move in which the self is entirely swallowed by the Other. This translates into an impossibly demanding definition of the free subject rather than one that defines the nature of free sub- jects in virtue of the options presented them; as Engels suggests, freedom emerges within the bounds of necessity.14 The second line of argument against the existence of subject-unity seems to rely on the existence of the unconscious. At any point in time, the individual is a mass of forces, many of which elude the purview of consciousness. Some aspects of the individual, like the deep generative rules of his grammar, are merely unknown to the individual, while others are repressed; these latter are the contents of the unconscious. Subject-unity is a myth constructed by ignor- ing many of the properties of the individual, including not only those that are 12.

Bruns, London, p. 128. 100</page><page sequence="13">Address to the Heathen unknown, but more importantly those that are unconscious. The individual always exceeds the subject-unity. The conflicting drives and forces of the un- conscious are sublated from our concept of the self. The subject-unity is a con- struct. The subject-unity is an illusion. Here we see the existence of the unconscious being used to make a meta- physical point. But exactly what metaphysical point is being made or refuted? Is the fact of the unconscious supposed to refute my belief that I have a per- sonal identity over time, that I am the same person today that I was two weeks ago? This belief does not rest on an assumption that I have all the same proper- ties I had two weeks ago, nor does it assume that I or anyone else should be able to enumerate every one of my properties of either two weeks ago or today. My lack of knowledge about many of my properties does not seem pertinent to my belief that I am the same substance today as I was yesterday. If I learned to my surprise that one of my properties was "the being who was almost killed by his angry third grade teacher on December 1, 1956," I might be amused but I wouldn't feel that this ignorance on my part challenged my belief that I was a unified substance over time. In terms of the unconscious and its contents, even its conflicting and contradictory contents, a belief in my personal identity over time commits me to believing that I have had the same, continuing, numeri- cally distinct unconscious over time -that I have not had someone else's un- conscious, so to speak- but I need not be committed to knowing all of the con- tents of my unconscious in order to believe that I am the same person over time. The above argument is meant to show that the fact of the unconscious does not confront the metaphysical question of personal identity where the claim that there is a personal identity over time amounts to the belief that I am a continuing subject, numerically distinct from other human substances. But perhaps the fact of the unconscious is supposed to address another metaphysi- cal issue, viz., the claim that a person is a self-conscious being. This claim often arises when theorists attempt to make a distinction between persons and non- persons. In making this division - in saying what a member of the class of per- sons is-theoreticians often include as a characteristic of persons that they be self-monitoring or self-aware. But if persons have an unconscious dimension, then there are necessarily some things that they do not monitor and of which they are not aware. Therefore, the idea of a self-monitoring person is a myth- ical construct. This argument, of course, is too hasty. In defining persons par- tially in terms of self-consciousness, it is not necessary to claim that they are conscious of everything about themselves. Self-consciousness amounts to the ability to audit a number of one's own responses but not to understand every mechanism - biological and psychic - of one's own organism. The existence of the unconscious, since it does not exclude the possibility of some areas of self- consciousness, does not directly confront the metaphysical claim that there are such things as persons and that this concept is more than a fabrication. 101</page><page sequence="14">OCTOBER The traditional philosophical position closest to the Althusserian attack on subject-unity is that of Nietzsche.15 In Nietzsche, we find the theses that the "I" of the cogito is an illusion, that we acquire our identity through language, that the hypostatization of the "I' is a confusion of grammar, and that this spurious entity is used to support the rules of society in terms of the myth of responsible agency. The crux of Nietzsche's attack is that the "I" of common sense and philosophy is a construct; Nietzsche calls it an interpretation. It is akin to the postulation of a theoretical entity like an atom. It cannot be perceived directly. It is not a simple reflection of all the flux of forces it stands for. It is what Nietzsche refers to as a fiction. For purposes of argument, we might admit part of Nietzsche's attack and yet balk at the whole. Let us assume that the "I" is postulated (even though this is an extremely controversial assertion). For Nietzsche, it is enough to say that if something is postulated, then it is in error. Nietzsche says this because he assumes that if there is any sense to the traditional concept of truth, it would be explicated by something like a perfect-picture, correspondence theory of truth. Armed with this reasoning he is able to discount the claims of philosophy and common sense. Every concept falls short of a perfect, automatic re-presentation of the world. One need not, however, accept this polemically charged concep- tion of truth and there are, furthermore, some very respectable arguments for a realist position regarding theoretical entities postulated through a process of in- ference to the best explanation.16 The point of enlisting Nietzsche here is that he seems to offer the clearest expression of the metaphysical sentiments that underlie Heath's manner of discussing the subject. Every hypostatization of the subject is an illusion because it falls short of a perfect representation of the individual. Anything short of such a representation is somehow "incomplete" and "false." Ideology in all its workings, including film, proliferates subject positions so that recognition of the inadequacy of the "I" to reflect reality is obscured. But this presumes that the task of any representation-linguistic, conceptual, mental, and so on-is the detailed replication of its object in all its ontological fullness. And this posi- tion presumes that anything less is a falsification. But one can argue that these premises, though they guarantee skepticism, are bad accounts of the nature of 15. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil. Also, in The Gay Science, Nietzsche argues that conscious- ness only develops with language and that our thoughts even about ourselves always derive from society. But here Nietzsche may only be making the Wittgensteinian point that "There would be no question of ascribing one's own states of consciousness or experience to anything unless one also ascribed, or were ready and able to ascribe, states of consciousness, or experiences, to others of the same logical type as that thing to which one ascribes one's own states of consciousness. The condition of reckoning oneself as a subject of such predicates is that one should also reckon others as subjects of such predicates. . ... If only mine, then not mine at all" (P. F. Strawson, Individuals, London, Methuen, 1959, pp. 104, 109). 16. E.g., Hilary Putnam, "Realism and Reason," in Meaning and the Moral Sciences, London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978. 102</page><page sequence="15">Address to the Heathen representation and falsity. This, of course, is not the place to attempt to erect a competing metaphysical/epistemological theory. My aim is only to forewarn film scholars that the foundations of Heath's project are anything but settled. It is commonly assumed in cinema studies that Lacanian psychoanalysis leaves the Kantian transcendental ego swamped in its wake. But it is difficult to see the relevance of psychoanalysis to the claims made for the unity of ap- perception by Kantians.17 Psychoanalysis seems rather to pertain to what Kantians would include in the realm of the empirical ego. This is not to assent to the notion of a transcendental ego, but only to say that psychoanalysis does not drive it away as neatly as a cross does a vampire. Nor do I understand why ideologically motivated film theorists are so preoccupied with attacking the transcendental ego. Other conceptions of the subject, like Hume's bundle theory and logical behaviorism, have been conjectured under capitalism, and these seem to be theories that can be as readily absorbed into the culture of capitalism as can Zen Buddhism and Catholicism. Capitalism does not seem to require one ruling conception of the subject for its continuity. The transcen- dental ego is not an indispensable element of capitalist mythology, nor is it clear that it or any specific theory of comparable generality is a prerequisite for capitalism. Film theorists, therefore, are not assured of finding the key to all capitalist ideology through the attempted isolation of something like the capital- ist subject. Lacanian metapsychology, as it blends into metaphysics, may just be the wrong starting point for the analysis of ideology in film. II. A Brief Digression. The Legacy of Brecht's Errors Bertolt Brecht supplied a number of the operational assumptions of main- stream film theory in the '70s, especially insofar as that theory was concerned with the relation of the dominant (narrative, capitalist) cinema and the alterna- tive (nonnarrative, putatively anti-capitalist) cinema. Brecht was drafted into service by Godard, who cited Brecht as the source of his own attempt to create an alternate style to that of commercial cinema. But Godard misinterpreted Brecht, imitating the latter's politically committed reflexivity but ignoring Brecht's equally politically motivated commitment to entertainment and acces- sibility. The results were works by Godard and his imitators of increasingly hermetic reflexivity-Marxism merging with modernism. This error was not Brecht's but the film world's and especially film academia's misappropria- tion of him. 17. See Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, especially "Criticism of the Third Paralogism of Transcendental Psychology." There Kant points out that the unity of the self as the transcen- dental unity of apperception neither entails nor is equivalent to the identity of a person. Psycho- analysis does not confront the issue of the transcendental self at the proper level of generality. For an example, though probably an unsuccessful one, of a direct confrontation with the Kantian va- riety of self-unity see Jean-Paul Sartre, The Transcendence of the Ego, New York, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1957. 103</page><page sequence="16">OCTOBER There is, however, another error traceable to Brecht from which he is less easily exonerated. It derives from the conflation of verisimilitude with ideologi- cal illusion. In contrasting his revolutionary Epic Theater with prevailing styles of naturalism, Brecht writes, Just as the composer wins back his freedom by no longer having to create atmosphere so that the audience may be helped to lose itself unreservedly in the events on the stage, so also the stage designer gets considerable freedom as he no longer has to give the illusion of a room or a locality when he is building his sets. It is enough for him to give hints, though these must make statements of greater historical or social interest than does the real setting. 18 and Restoring the theater's reality as theater is now a precondition for any possibility of arriving at realistic images of human social life. Too much heightening of the illusion in the setting, together with a "mag- netic" way of acting that gives the spectator the illusion of being pres- ent at a fleeting, accidental "real event," create such an impression of naturalness that one can no longer interpose one's judgments, imagi- nation and reactions, and must simply conform by sharing in the ex- perience and become one of "nature's" objects. The illusion created by the theatre must be a partial one, in order that it may always be recognized as an illusion.19 These passages indicate that Brecht believes that the mimetic techniques of staging create illusions of reality in spectators.20 Moreover, like Plato2l and 18. Bertolt Brecht, "A Short Organum for the Theater," from Brecht on Theater, ed. and trans. John Willet, New York, Hill and Wang, 1964, section 72, p. 203 (italics added). 19. Brecht, "From the Mother Courage Model," Brecht on Theater, p. 219 (italics added). One, of course, wonders if Brecht can consistently reject naturalism tout court given the pragmatic in- strumentalism he adopts toward symbol systems in "Against Georg Lukacs," New Left Review, no. 84 (March-April 1974). I think that one way to assuage this tension might be for exegetes of Brecht to say that the "illusionism" quotations that I am stressing in this section are off-hand or careless remarks of Brecht that do not really reflect the central parts of his thinking on this matter. That may be true. Nevertheless, I still feel it is important to examine the claims of the interpreta- tion of Brecht that I characterize above because something like that interpretation is shared by many cine-Brechtians as well as by certain exponents of avant-garde theater. One argument in favor of an illusion theory of spectator response-i.e., a theory that says spectators believe they are somehow witnessing the "real thing"-is to ask a psychological ques- tion: "Why would audiences cry and scream unless they believed the events before them were ac- tually occurring?" I do not examine this type of argument in the section above because it is not one that cine-Brechtians rely on. However, for the record, let me say that I would begin to answer it by denying the psychological assumption that we are only moved by events that we believe are actual. 104</page><page sequence="17">Address to the Heathen Kant,22 Brecht takes a dim view of mimesis. (Throughout, I use mimesis as shorthand for visual verisimilitude.) For Brecht, not only are techniques of verisi- militude illusions in themselves, but they also facilitate further illusions. They prime the audience to accept the ideological falsehoods enacted in the plot. They also induce acceptance of falsehoods that inhere in classical plotting as such -the illusion that everyone behaves as the characters of the narrative do, the illusion of compelling momentum, that is, the way the event is presented is the way it had to happen-that society cannot be changed. This illusion theory of naturalist theater was adopted by film theorists and avant-garde filmmakers, who applied it to the dominant narrative cinema. The theory has three tiers of illusions: of verisimilitude, of narrative structure, and of the specific story. Applied to a film like Rocky III, the theory would be exemplified in the following way: The photographic image itself, plus set details, costuming, and so on, promote the illusion of cinematic verity; the genre structure of the plot suggests as a social law that the only way to deal with uncivilized misfits like Slugger Lang is to beat their brains in; the specific saga of Rocky is a gaudy, optimistic, ideological advertisement for the power of positive thinking and the indomitable potential of the individual will. Each of these illusions are ideologically motivated and are coordinated to produce an overall ideological effect. Cinema scholars can study the interrelation of these tiers of illusion or they can study the tiers separately. Much of the ambitious film theory of the '70s, such as Heath's, has concentrated on analyses of nar- rative illusionism and of the illusionism of cinematic verisimilitude, and on analyses of the interrelation of these two tiers of illusion. Though one can understand how film scholars are extrapolating from Brecht, the move is inadvisable, since the Brechtian framework is riven with errors. We are asked to believe that mimetic staging and, by extension, mi- metic photography are illusions. But what can be meant by illusion in this con- text? Clearly, it means something which leads to a false belief. But this mean- ing must, of course, be even more refined because anything can be used to lead someone at some time into a false belief. Illusion, therefore, must be something that has a high probability, in normal circumstances, of leading normal sub- jects into false beliefs. But what false beliefs do naturalistic staging and mimetic 20. In writing this section I have benefited greatly from discussion with James Hamilton as well as from reading his "'Illusion' and the Distrust of Theatre," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Fall 1982. Hamilton's essay deals not only with the reputed illusionism of naturalist staging, but also with the reputed illusions of naturalistic acting, a topic I do not discuss here. 21. Plato attacks mimesis on epistemic grounds in Republic, Book X. It is this attack that Hegel attacks in the opening of his "Introduction" to the Philosophy of Fine Art. It is also interesting to note, from the perspective of contemporary film criticism, that Plato not only condemned mimesis on epistemic grounds but also condemned mimetic drama for inclining spectators toward incorrect behavior (cf. Republic, X, 606d). 22. Immanuel Kant, "Analytic of the Sublime," in Critique of Judgment, section 42. 105</page><page sequence="18">OCTOBER cinematography lead normal viewers to embrace? Purportedly, viewers mis- take the events depicted by these means of representation for actual events. But this is absurd; the mistaking of plays and films for the real thing by yokels is a standard, universally appreciated, age-old joke of both theater and film because one would have to be abnormally dim-witted to make such an error. Most plays and films, when seen in standard viewing conditions, don't look like events and locales outside the theater. Things like the monocular station point, scale variation, and black-and-white photography work against a film's being taken for reality while the missing fourth walls should persuade uninformed theater goers that something is amiss. But, of course, the telling point is that theater goers and film goers are informed; theater going and film going are in- stitutionalized activities; the normal spectator in the normal viewing circum- stances is there to see representations, not the real thing. The apocryphal yokels are funny because of their extraordinary ignorance. They are not nor- mal viewers. Maybe they are such stereotypical comic butts because everyone can feel superior to them. There is, perhaps, a sense in which "x is an illusion of y" means simply that "x looks like y." A stage flat is an illusion of a house if it looks like a house in certain relevant respects. This does not mean that it looks exactly like a house. Indeed, it may not look like a house at all in the sense that it can be taken for a house, and yet it may look like a house across a limited number of dimensions - it has a door and windows while also being obviously a piece of canvas. In this sense a spectator can call the stage flat an illusion when that means that it looks like a house because it has certain representationally relevant similarities to a house, but saying this does not commit the spectator to believing that the stage flat is a house. Let us call this the (epistemically) benign sense of illusion. The Brechtian, ideological sense of illusion, however, regards mimetic stage flats and film images in a way that implies that normal spectators are deceived or ensnared in falsity by verisimilitude. The argument seems to succeed by ini- tially describing its objects by means of the benign sense of illusion and then fallaciously switching to the deception sense of illusion mid-proof. In respect to its capacity for equivocation, perhaps the benign sense is not so benignant after all, and might better be dropped altogether. The problem with the deception sense of illusion as applied to mimesis is that it takes at face value effusive critical claims like "the play was so good it seemed real." These are obviously tropes of hyperbolic praise-the play was so good that it achieved something impossible (it seemed unequivocably real)- and not the data of a theory of mimesis. Plays and films are often spoken of as if they were optical illusions-pre- senting misleading appearances, like straight sticks in streams. This talk may prompt theorists to regard plays and films as deceptions. But such theorists are victims of their own metaphors. For optical illusions only become full-blooded illusions when they provoke the formation of false beliefs in the face of obvious 106</page><page sequence="19">Address to the Heathen counter-evidence or information. And, as psychologists never tire of pointing out, human organisms do not simply rely on what is imprinted on their retinas for their beliefs about the world but on other evidence and information that surround the moment of perception. I do not turn the image in my bathroom mirror into a belief that my doppelganger is before me not only because I know about mirrors (though that is very crucial) but also because the doppelganger hypothesis is refuted by my other senses-just as my hand corrects my eye when dealing with straight sticks in water. The likelihood that a normal per- ceiver could be deceived by a film image drops precipitously as soon as he can perform physical operations in relation to the screen; I can change my position enough (even in my theater seat) to realize the visual array is not three- dimensional if I am ever in doubt about film's oddly glowing "realities." And with theater and film, even if there were not ordinarily, in fact, other cues, my knowledge that these appearances are presented as representations within the institutions of theater and cinema would be enough to block the occurrence of (epistemic) illusion, just as I would reject these appearances as real because they don't fit coherently with the rest of my knowledge about the way the world is physically, architecturally, and socially (do people usually squabble in kitchens with views fronting on fifteen-hundred seat auditoriums?). And, of course, even though plays and films may employ optical illusions as constituent elements, entire plays and films are not optical illusions. They are marked and disseminated as what they are - plays and films - and they trick no one except theoreticians. Nor are the producers of these spectacles interested in fooling spectators. Imagine the chagrin of the makers of Tora! Tora! Tora! had the opening of that film not been reported in the arts section of The New York Times but on the front page as a news item under the headline-"World War II Breaks Out on Broad- way." In short, the idea that the practice of mimesis and representation can be explicated by reference to an epistemically pejorative concept of illusion is utterly con- fused. Defenders of the position may claim that there is some special sense of illusion that I am insensitive to. If so then it is up to them to produce it. If mimesis does not produce the illusion of real events, there is even less reason to believe that in and of itself, it produces the illusion that society cannot be changed. With respect to this claim the Brechtian line is ambiguous, for it holds that mimesis is not just illusory but also conducive to further illusions. Mimetic appearances abet the audience's acceptance of the ideological false- hoods that are stated in the plot and implied by the plot structure. For Brecht, mimetic appearances accomplish this by putting the spectators in a sort of trance which paralyses their critical faculties in respect to social falsehoods. Mimetic appearance is rather like the immobilizing sting of the spider. Mime- sis and diegesis are thus synchronized in order to dispense vicious propaganda. The postulated connection between mimetic appearances and uncritical acceptance is a causal hypothesis. As armchair psychology, it is a reasonable 107</page><page sequence="20">OCTOBER formulation; it is neither self-contradictory nor silly. But it needs to be weighed against the evidence. And once it is matched with the available data, the thesis as stated, though reasonable, appears absolutely false. Think of all the critical faculties that were not paralyzed by an exercise in verisimilitude like Fort Apache, the Bronx. Moreover, one asks of those viewers who thought the film was truthful about communal life in the South Bronx whether it was the mimetic cinematography that got to them rather than the fact that they already believed certain myths about the unrelenting violence of black social life? And wouldn't such viewers continue to believe these myths if the film were shown out of focus or if the production had been a stick-figure cartoon? Also, the lack of verisimili- tude does not correlate to the operation of the spectators' critical faculties. Witness Jordan Belson's religioso-cosmic abstractions, which evoke an ultimate sense of inevitability without a glimmer of mimesis. Nor does the practice of revealing the film to be a film (by alluding internally to the process of filmmak- ing) guarantee that the film will be viewed critically. Both Roma and Clowns are about themselves and their author, but Fellini's reflexivity only subserves his macrocosmic/microcosmic sensibility, which transforms everything into yet another emblem of his life-affirmative belief in the zesty pluralism of reality. Indeed, one suspects that Fellini's intrusions in the films allow him to get away with his shameless exploitation of shopworn universalistic (clown as man, city as life) images. Be that as it may, the belief that visual mimesis necessarily in- clines the spectator toward acceptance of the ideological falsehoods of the diegesis is ill-fated. Similarly, the claim that narrative structures per se instill ideological com- placency deserves demonstration rather than repetition. For what are we to say of particular films like Rules of the Game, Kammeradschaft, Mother, and La Terra Trema, which, though classically narrated, all in their different ways suggest that society should be otherwise? I have introduced the Brechtian framework because it provided the work- ing model for most mainstream film theory in the '70s. Heath's position is basi- cally a variation on that model. But the model itself is not in very good shape, and variations on it are likely to preserve its weak points. They also develop problems of their own in the process of further elaborating it. This is true of Heath, who tries to offer an Althusserian-Lacanian account of the way in which cinematic mimesis and diegesis are ideological illusions, and of the man- ner of their coordination in the production of a single ideological effect. More- over, Heath holds mimesis and diegesis to be congruent in terms of the means by which they produce ideological illusions. He fleshes out the Brechtian model by making subject-unity the focal ideological effect of his analysis of narrative, mimetic cinema. One might say that in doing this he is providing the psycho- logical underpinning for the premises of the Brechtian model - though one might marvel that anyone would bother to attempt to itemize the causal sub- structure of phenomena as unlikely and as unproven as the various Brechtian 108</page><page sequence="21">Address to the Heathen illusions. Nonexistent phenomena have no causal substructure. In fact, Heath seems to be trying to explain some extremely shaky claims about what is dubi- ously thought of as cinematic illusionism by means of some equally suspect psychology. III. Narrative Space Like other cine-Brechtians, Heath holds that in the dominant narrative cinema mimesis and diegesis represent a coordinated system for producing ideological illusions. The key illusion that Heath is concerned with is subject- unity. Mimesis, which is discussed primarily in terms of perspective, and nar- rative each create subject-unities in the same way; they both supposedly position or center subjects in relation to the space represented in the film's visual imag- ery. Perspective is said to do this because a perspectival image entails a single (putatively unified and central) viewing point for the spectator. Each perspec- tivally correct cinematographic image entails an exact station point from which the cone of vision emanates. That point is the subject's position. Heath claims that the operation of perspective in film faces certain formal problems that do not exist in painting. These problems are a result of the fact that there is movement of character and camera in film. This movement puta- tively provokes a crisis within the perspective system, since, for example, with every cut the subject position is altered. How does the dominant cinema hide this so that the spectator does not become apprized of the disunity of subject positions? The answer is found in narrative. The "disunity" of changing perspectival points is masked by the unity and coherence of the story and by the coherence of various narrative-cinematic de- vices, such as point-of-view editing. In Heath's variation of the cine-Brechtian position, mimesis does not simply pave the way for the illusions of diegesis: diegesis "supports" mimesis as well by occulting the shortcomings of the mi- metic, perspectival system in regard to that system's positioning of the subject in film. Thus, in an important way, the coherent space in films of the dominant cinema is first and foremost narrative space. Narrative enhances the effective- ness of cinematographic mimesis, and that enhancement, in turn, increases the effectiveness of the ideological address of the film as a whole. IlIa. Heath on Perspective Linear perspective is built into the camera. It is a system of representation that is derived from the optical theory of vision. When a picture of x follows the rules of perspective, it is said that the picture delivers a sheaf of light rays to an appropriately positioned viewer which is in pertinent respects isomorphic to the visual array that x would deliver to the fixed monocular station point of a viewer of x in the world. For centuries, perspective was regarded as a nonrela- 109</page><page sequence="22">OCTOBER tivistic, nonconventional system for accurately depicting the world. It was held to be the best means for achieving pictorial fidelity.23 In recent years, this posi- tion has corre under attack.24 Heath believes that perspective is a relativistic convention that is presented as an accurate depiction of the look of the physical world for ideological purposes. Heath opens his attack on perspective by noting its historical origins in the Renaissance. He emphasizes the way in which this system is based on the model of a visual pyramid with the eye at the apex. But he also adds that what is shown by a perspectivally correct cinematographic image is not a perfect replica of what we ordinarily see. Perspective is based on the presupposition of a fixed, monocular station point, whereas we most typically view things binoc- ularly, scanning constantly, readjusting our vantage point on an array, and so forth. Thus, perspective does not really replicate the world as we ordinarily see it. This leads Heath to call it an ideal, a utopian ideal, by which he means, in part, that it is an idealization of normal perception. There is, moreover, some- thing deceptive about it because it is proffered as the way we see when in fact we do not customarily view the world under the constraints of the linear per- spective system. We of Western culture, furthermore, have spread our ideal of vision as part of our general program of imperialism. Quoting the art historian Pierre Francastel, Heath avers, "in the fifteenth century, the human societies of Western Europe organized, in the material and intellectual senses of the term, a space completely different from that of the preceding generations; with their technical superiority, they progressively imposed that space over the planet" (p. 29). Heath, like Francastel, believes that perspective is a convention that must be seen as relative to a certain historical moment. "Spaces are born and die like societies; they live; they have a history" (p. 29). We have come to accept per- spective as an accurate depiction of space but this is really a matter of habitua- tion. "For five centuries men and women exist at ease in that space; the Quat- trocento system provides a practical representation of the world which in time appears so natural as to offer its real representation, the immediate translation 23. In this section I am particularly indebted to Alan Tormey's "Seeing Things: Pictures, Paradoxes, and Perspective," in Perceiving Artworks, ed. by John Fisher, Philadelphia, Temple University Press, 1980. I am adopting the concept of pictorial fidelity from Tormey. 24. Recent attacks on perspective include Nelson Goodman, Languages of Art, Indianapolis, Bobbs-Merrill, 1968; Marx Wartofsky, "Rules and Representation: The Virtues of Constancy and Fidelity Put in Perspective," Erkenntniss 12 (1978); and Wartofsky, "Art History and Percep- tion," in Perceiving Artworks. Major defenses of perspective include J. J. Gibson, The Senses Con- sidered as Perceptual Systems, Boston, 1966; Gibson, "Pictures, Perspective and Perception," Leonardo 4 (1971); E. H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion, New York, 1960; Gombrich, "The 'What' and the 'How': Perspective, Representation and the Phenomenal World," in Logic andArt, ed. R. Rudner and I.

Margaret Hagan summarizes a number of the posi- tions in the debate in "Picture Perception: Toward a Theoretical Model," Psychological Bulletin, vol. 81, no. 8 (1974). 110</page><page sequence="23">Address to the Heathen of reality itself" (pp. 29-30). But it is not a "real representation" seemingly because, though it presents itself as a replica of ordinary vision, it is not. Also, its ideal of vision is itself ideological because it engenders the production of ideological subject-unities. Heath makes this point by exploiting the similarity of the terminology used in the description of perspective with the terminology that describes subject construction. Speaking of G. Ten Doesschate's descrip- tion of perspective, Heath says, The component elements of that account should be noted: the possi- ble exact match for the eye of picture and object, the deceptive illu- sion; the centre of the illusion, the eye in place. What is fundamental is the idea of the spectator at a window, an "apertafinestra"that gives a view on the world- framed, centred, harmonious . . . (p. 28). The perspective ideal of vision is coincident with illusionary subject-unity. It implements subject positioning, literally suggesting a correct place for the spectator. The pivotal point in this argument is that perspective is an ideal rather than an accurate way of depicting the world. Though it presents itself as a replica of vision, it is not a perfect duplication of the way we see. But though it is true that perspective does not replicate ordinary vision, I am not convinced that this is the purpose of perspective, nor does it seem to me to decide the case against perspective as an accurate, indeed as the most accurate, means of pic- torially depicting the world. In other words, I don't believe that Heath has defeated the nonrelativistic, nonconventionalist claims for perspective. To defend the accuracy of perspective we must clarify what perspective is supposed to be accurate about. If we say that perspective must, in order to be accurate, afford a perfect replica of normal vision, then perspective is not ac- curate. But is this the right requirement for accuracy? Heath can obviously find theoreticians who will make claims of this sort for perspective's accuracy. But are they correct? I think not. When I say that a perspective picture of a scene in nature is accurate I do not mean that it is a perfect replica of anything, includ- ing human vision. Rather I mean that it provides accurate information about certain aspects of the appearance of the natural scene; of course, the informa- tion perspective drawings excel in providing concerns the appearance of the relative positions of things in space and the distances between them. No other system of pictorial representation is as good at giving us this kind of informa- tion. Other systems of representation, the ancient Egyptian for example, had other purposes than the perspective system does. But it cannot be denied that for the purpose of pictorially projecting the placement of things in space the perspective system is superior-that is, contains more accurate information- than the Egyptian system. In fact, the perspective system is more accurate in terms of affording spatial information than any other mimetic pictorial system. 111</page><page sequence="24">OCTOBER Two points in my argument need to be extended. First, there is the differ- ence between the claim that a system provides a perfect replica of the world or vision and the claim that it provides an accurate replica. For accuracy is a mat- ter of degree. My claim is that in the nonconventionalist sense, perspective, transculturally considered, is the most accurate mimetic representational sys- tem. But how do we measure accuracy across representational systems? We can't, unless we stipulate the meaning of accuracy in respect to some specific dimension. This leads to my second point: when nonrelativists claim accuracy for perspective, they are saying that no competing mimetic representational system is as accurate as perspective in rendering information about the appear- ance of the relative disposition of objects in space.25 This, it seems to me, is in- contestable. Furthermore, perspective accomplishes this because it has been grounded in the laws of vision. No other system of representation is based on scientific laws in this way. And the laws from which perspective derives are in no sense conventional, arbitrary, or adopted by fiat. They are laws. This is the source of what gives the system the accuracy it has in recreating the spatial ap- pearance of the world. Moreover, the laws of the scientific theory in question were not adopted as a result of a social compact or decision; they were not in- vented; they were discovered.26 The relativist, considering the preceding argument, will believe that he has located a slip up. For to make my argument I must stipulate that the rele- vant sense of accuracy is accuracy in respect of the disposition of objects in space. This is correct but it does not cut against my argument since it is a con- ditional one -if we want pictorial accuracy or fidelity about the appearance of the disposition of objects in space, then perspective is best suited to the pur- pose. I admit that we may not be especially concerned with this kind of accu- racy, but this is beside the point. If we want to saw through metal, then we do best to use a hack saw; if we want accurate spatial information about the ap- pearance of the world from our pictures, then we use perspective. In neither case are we playing by the rules of society. We are adapting to the structure of the world. The relativist is right in arguing that there are many different repre- sentational systems. And many of these systems are not devoted to giving accu- rate information about the way the world appears-for example, abstract ex- pressionism. These nonperspectival systems may interest us-especially from an aesthetic point of view - because they have features and purposes besides those of delivering accurate spatial appearances. And for purposes other than delivering accurate spatial information, these other systems may be more desir- 25. The notion of perspectival accuracy as relative to contrasting pictorial systems, for ex- ample, can be found in John White, The Birth and Rebirth of Pictorial Space, New York, Harper and Row, 1972, p. 125. 26. Tormey, p. 69. 112</page><page sequence="25">Address to the Heathen able and superior to the perspective system. But if one is committed to pictorial fidelity in respect to spatial appearance, then perspective is, as a result of its scientific origins, the best means to that end.27 We may make our point in a related but slightly different way by drawing a distinction between the genus, representational systems, and the species, mimetic systems. Representational systems include pictorial practices that refer to the world but which do not necessarily resemble the objects they stand for. Mimetic systems are representational pictorial systems that refer to their objects by way of resembling those objects in certain respects. As the relativist points out, there are many pictorial representational practices in which the mimesis of spatial appearances is not a priority, or is a very low priority. In- deed, one may have a representational, pictorial practice that does not demand any sort of resemblance. Its existence in a culture's representational system may be a product of the social contract. But the fact that there exist nonmimetic pictorial practices does not tell against the accuracy of perspective; it only shows that there can be representational systems for which such accuracy is irrelevant. The question of accuracy-which is a question of a degree of a specific variety of accuracy - arises when we confront a range of avowedly mimetic systems which include among their purposes the portrayal of the spatial appearance of the world. Note, here, that I am only speaking of a sub- set of mimetic systems. But of this subset, those that employ perspective are the most accurate. Are we confronting the imperialistic arrogance of the West, as Francastel believes? No. In the early eighteenth century, the Japanese taught themselves the Western perspective system by comparing the perspective illustrations of Dutch scientific books to their own illustrations, and they judged the Dutch illustrations to be more "lifelike" 28 (which I would interpret as more accurate for the purpose of spatial mimesis). This resulted in the genre of Uki-e, or "relief pictures," pictures of 3-D effect using perspective and shading, made by Hokusai, Kunizoshi, and Hiroshige, among others, and easily marketed.29 It may make sense to be an "incommensurability" relativist about perspec- tive when we are debating whether it is the aesthetically best pictorial system; certainly paintings with "floating points of view" can be aesthetically superior to perspective paintings, and it may be difficult to weigh the comparative value of a masterpiece in the perspective style with a masterpiece of the floating point- of-view style. We can make the prosaic observation, nevertheless, that, all things being equal, the perspective painting will give us more accurate infor- mation about spatial appearances than will the painting with the floating point 27.

This is the sense in which perspective can be said to be "true" to the world, though it may be better to express this by saying that it has the highest available fidelity. That is, perspective is not a dissimulation, as Heath would have it, a counterfeit replica of vision: it is the most accurate means of render- ing information about spatial appearance.30 Insofar as Heath fails to establish that our faith in the pictorial fidelity of perspective is a piece of self-deception, his explanation of the mechanism of this self-deception is chimerical. A brief review of Heath's attempted explanation will be instructive, however, since it can alert us to certain peculiarities of argu- ment that run through the entirety of his book. The perspective system, built into the camera, positions the subject. The film poses an image, not immediate or neutral, but posed, framed, and centred. Perspective-system images bind the spectator in place, the suturing central position that is the sense of the image, that sets its scene (in place, the spectator completes the image as its subject) (p. 53). We can give Heath's first use of "in place" some literal sense. Namely, a per- spectival image has an optimal station point, a place in space. When viewing a movie, few of us ever occupy this precise station point. Yet, the image may be said to have this point, even if our inhabiting it is rarely germane to our still deriving accurate spatial information from the image (I can sit in the side aisle and still know that Humongus is about three feet behind his next victim). Heath would have it that the perspective system somehow enjoins us to believe that we are at that station point-that we identify our position, wherever we are in the theater, with the location of the camera lens in relation to the profilmic visual array. We are thus seduced into believing that we have a certain position in relation to the film, a unitary place in the center of the action. This sense of "in place" leads to another-the Althusserian-Lacanian sense of "in place" in the above quotation. Identifying with the visual center of the action causes a sense 30. I believe that it is the sort of "incommensurability" case, described above, that relativists have in mind when they denigrate perspective. Their real point is that different cultures and different peoples may seek qualities different from those offered by perspective. True enough. If, however, you prize accurate spatial information above all else in your pictorial system, you must adopt perspective. In recent times, some theorists have claimed that perspective is a representational system uniquely suited to capitalism. Stan Brakhage, in a talk at the Millennium Film Workshop, called perspective a form of land-grabbing, while John Berger, in Ways of Seeing, claims that it is one of a repertoire of devices that enable the capitalist to display his possessions. But, though perspective may suit capitalism, I see no reason to believe that it uniquely suits capitalism. Perspective's basic concern is with where things appear to stand in space. This is an inescapable human concern, one of quite as much interest to hunter-gatherers as to shipping magnates. Of course, I do not mean to suggest that the biologically deep concern to which perspective responds elevates pic- torial perspective above every other kind of pictorial enterprise. 114</page><page sequence="27">Address to the Heathen of psychological subject-unity-the illusion of the self as a single, unitary, placed, centrally positioned center of experience-which presumably, in turn, heightens the illusion of the image. I am far from convinced that a perspectival image leads me to identify my position with that of the camera. I, like the majority of my fellow spectators, have a rough idea of how cameras work as well as the knowledge that the film image that I am seeing is camera generated. Consequently, I do not identify the image with my vision. Perhaps it is too extreme to claim that most viewers regard the image precisely as a centrally projected optic array. But viewers do know that the image is the product of a camera and this is what is crucial to their comprehension of the film event. A simple phenomenological examina- tion of normal film viewing shows that spectators do not identify with the cam- era. Most of the time the camera "sees" more than I see since I tend to focus only on those quadrants of the image where the action is. Indeed, filmmakers often exploit this fact by suddenly introducing a "surprise" character in a part of the screen that I have been ignoring. My eye usually navigates inside the camera image; I do not take my vision to be coextensive with that of the cam- era's visual field, which I assume I would if I identified with the camera. We don't identify with the camera - it makes certain things available for sight; the im- age is not taken to be sight nor, for spectators aware of how cameras operate, is it surrogate sight. We treat camera images more like the way we regard the world-as opportunities for sensations and perceptions-than the way we regard our own sensations and perceptions.31 This is not to say that we take these images to be real in any sense, but that we respond to them with an 31. Although I do not accept Cavell's realist position with regard to film images -that film ex- hibits the world past - I find his characterization of our sense of being outside the film more ac- curate than Heath's notion of camera identification. See Stanley Cavell, The World Viewed, New York, Viking, 1971. Unlike Cavell, I would not analyze the viewing situation in terms of wit- nessing a world past but as witnessing camera images, which we view as such, fully cognizant of how they are made. It seems to me that one of the pressing limitations of traditional film theory is that it forces us to understand the viewing situation through either the metaphor of the image as a reproduction of sight or the metaphor of the image as a piece of reality. Both options are inadequate. It should be noted that Heath has an argument against the idea that film reproduces real- ity. Heath writes, "Instead of holding a reproduction of life (Lumiere was adamant in later years: 'the film subjects I chose are proof that I only wished to reproduce life'), it (film) holds to a repro- duction of the image of life. Of Lumiere one has the right to demand to know where this 'life' comes from -and the answer is certainly not from itself, for life is composed on screen of repre- sentations of work, family and leisure, La Sortie des usines, Le Repas de bebe and LArroseur arrose, chosen subjects indeed. Of the reproduction thesis one has the right to demand to know where the image comes from and what it is doing in the film" (p. 4). Heath seems to be saying that film cannot objectively reproduce life because its images are selected. This is a bad argument. Selectivity, in and of itself, does not preclude objectivity. I have elsewhere discussed the wayward arguments of film theorists who claim that the necessity of selection in filmmaking undercuts the possibility of film's being objective; see "From Real to Reel: Entangled in Nonfiction Film." 115</page><page sequence="28">OCTOBER awareness that we are "outside" rather than "inside" the world of the photo- graph; and it is this quality of outsideness that makes seeing a motion picture like seeing an event (though only in this specified respect). Moreover, this does not cause the spectator any particular sense of mystery or confusion since the spectator knows how camera images are generated. Indeed, that knowledge is also one of the factors that leads us to look at the image rather than to take the camera's view as coextensive with our own. The relation between the spectator and the screen is not best explicated by a two-term relationship: the spectator identifies with the camera. Rather, the spectator sees an image which he under- stands was generated by a camera in a determinate position as regards the profilmic event. We look at successive camera views rather than identifying with successive camera views. Our knowledge of cameras enables us to follow what is happening on screen, confident of where our seat is in the theater and of where the camera was. We don't have to postulate spectator identification with the exact position of the camera in order to explain how spectators are able to orient themselves to perspectival screen images, but only some very rudimen- tary, readily available knowledge about cameras. If spectators did identify with the position of the camera, they could only do this by ignoring a great deal of visual information which the human organ- ism has at its disposal (if only subliminally). Cameras don't "see around cor- ners." So when I watch a film from the extreme left side of the theater, I will not see the same thing that I would see if I occupied the same seating arrangement in relation to the profilmic event. This does not prevent me from getting accu- rate information about spatial appearances from the screen, for if I know about cameras, I know the disposition of objects is relative to the lens and not to my seat. But if Heath wants to claim identification with the camera he must ex- plain how the organism represses all the available spatial cues at its disposal. Heath attempts to do this through reference to an unconscious mechanism that is especially responsive to perspective. In order to assess Heath's putative ex- planation, we must scrutinize the supposed internal workings of this uncon- scious mechanism. Heath describes perspective in terms of a central position, a unified place. Words like central, position, unified are key words in the Althusserian-Lacanian psychology. They are words used to describe subject construction. Indeed, subject construction, in the conceptual framework that Heath assumes, is synonymous with subject positioning and subject-unity. Thus, the explanation we are being offered of the spectator's identification with the camera appears to be that given the central (single, unified) position (place) of the station point in perspective, the spectator is lured (and deceived) into identifying with the camera lens (and filtering out all the contrary, available spatial cues) because the structure of perspective reinforces the illusion of subject-unity (in the psychological-ideological sense) and, presumably, because spectators are prone to accept reinforcements of the illusion of subject-unity above countervailing cognitive and perceptual stimuli. Is this a persuasive explanation? 116</page><page sequence="29">Address to the Heathen If we agree that there is a literal sense in which perspective involves a posi- tion, then the sense in which it "positions spectators" is nonliteral; it does not, for example, move them around the theater. Furthermore, the sense in which spectators are positioned as subject-unities is also not literal, but rather is an explanatory metaphor, one that pertains to a conception of the self without any reference to actual points in space. But what do these different phases of the identification process have to do with each other besides the fact that they are described by a similar vocabulary? Perspective does not require that we be positioned at the literal monocular station point of the image in order to work effectively as a mimetic representation, so it does not literally position us- though it may metaphorically position us in the sense of establishing the orien- tation of the action. But even if perspective did somehow literally dictate our central position, how would that cause the belief that each of us is a unitary subject? After all, the idea that we are the (nonspatial) centers of our experi- ences is another metaphor. How do we or our psyches parlay a (doubtful) spa- tial position of centrality into a belief about the centrality of the subject? The latter is a very different phenomenon from the former even if it is described in similar words. The Althusserian-Lacanian position does maintain that visual stimuli have an especially powerful role in the formation of identity. Never- theless, the equivocation on the word center in Heath's account cannot be bol- stered by a simple allusion to the mirror stage since literal, physical centering is not a necessary component of that phenomenon -couldn't a child be standing at the left corner of his looking glass? Rather it seems that Heath will have to postulate an etymologically playful psychic mechanism that moves from per- spective's station point to subject-unity along a series of puns. That, in and of itself, is not, in principle, an insurmountable problem, since it has been estab- lished that the unconscious is fond of literalizations and verbal images. The problem is more specifically whether Heath can postulate unconscious recep- tivity to the puns he relies on in his explanation -position, for example. That is, either the receptivity to such puns is part of the psychic mechanism or it is an equivocation on the part of Heath's attempted explanation. The former, with- out further argumentation, appears unlikely, especially when one recalls that certain of Heath's subject-unity metaphors are not common parlance, but eso- teric jargon of a very recent, marginal school of psychoanalysis. Are we to believe that the unconscious knew these puns as early as the Quattrocento? Also, are we to believe that the normal viewer unconsciously knows the rhetoric of the theory of perspective? On the other hand, a weakness for equivocation colors all the rest of Heath's enterprise and, thus, seems in operation in this ex- planation too. IIIb. The Stabilization of Cinematic Perspective by Means of Narrative Each perspectivally correct film image positions the spectator. But the ideological effect of perspective in film is threatened by cinematic movement. 117</page><page sequence="30">OCTOBER For Heath, character movement, camera movement, and editing potentially imperil the subject position constructed by the film image through perspective. The question, then, is how in the dominant cinema, whose ideological task is to position subjects, the filmic system is able to sustain the perspective effect, despite the potential conflicting disruptions of cinematic movement. The an- swer given is narrative. The coherence of a narrative positions the subject and maintains the perspective illusion by centering the subject through diegetic in- telligibility and closure. The narrative is able to do this because, like perspec- tive, narrative is a system that places and centers subjects. Perspective and nar- rative are not only coordinated systems but also systems that independently have the same effect. When the perspective system begins to flag, the same effect is imposed on the spectator by the story. We might think of perspective and narrative as two pumps calibrated to bail out a set volume of water. When the perspective pump sputters, the narrative pump makes up the difference, though the less reliable perspective pump is still an irreplaceable asset to the system insofar as the given volume of water could not be evacuated without it. Narrative contains the mobility that could threaten the clarity of vi- sion in a constant renewal of perspective; space becomes place- narrative as the taking place of film -in a movement which is no more than the fulfillment of the Renaissance impetus. . . . what enters cinema is a logic of movement (human action, author's addi- tion) and it is this logic that, in other words, is constructed as nar- rative space (p. 36). Once films are films of people, the spectator is centered by the logic of human action, thus compensating for the distractions of human movement in the perspectival array. For Heath, the presence of people in a film image is a sufficient condition for considering the image narrative.32 And the narrative of such an image stabilizes the subject position. As shots are added to shots or as the camera moves, the subject center is sustained by the coherence of the story as an intelligible representation of human action. Techniques of continuity editing, grounded in the logic of human action and the continuity of the narrative, support the illusion of the central subject position that is engendered by cinematographic perspective. For Heath, one of the most important techniques of narrative film in this process is point-of-view editing. Consequently, he explains at length the way in which point-of-view editing recapitulates the perspective effect in editing. The type of editing analyzed involves a shot of an object, person, or event 32. According to Heath, you have a narrative as soon as you have people in a film. This overly broad concept of narrative is endemic in contemporary film theory where it seems that it is vir- tually impossible to make anything that is not a narrative -anything structured or that makes sense is seen as a narrative (or maybe even as an allegory). This folderol should be abandoned. 118</page><page sequence="31">Address to the Heathen which gives way to a shot of a character who is ostensibly looking at the con- tents of the first shot. This framework, and more complicated variations on it, occur very often in narrative films. It has been estimated that such cutting pat- terns may account for thirty to forty percent of the editing in the films of the dominant narrative cinema.33 Heath sees it as a cornerstone in the construction of narrative space. How to make sense in film if not through vision, film with its found- ing ideology of vision as truth? The drama of vision in the film re- turns the drama of vision of the film: the spectator will be bound to the film as spectacle on the basis of a narrative organization of look and point of view that moves space into place through the image- flow: the character, figure of the look, is a kind of perspective within the perspective system, regulating the world, orientating space, pro- viding directions-and for the spectator (p. 44). The point-of-view framework stabilizes the image flow and enables the specta- tor to "read" (comprehend) it by centering the imagery in a coherent human ac- tion (looking) and by creating a virtual perspective system (the character as sta- tion point) within the film itself. Thus, the point-of-view cut is an exemplary narrative device in film because it so perfectly realizes the ideological narrative function of sustaining the subject positioning accomplished by perspective. Also, though point-of-view editing supports the illusion of the perspective effect, it, like a snake devouring its own tail, relies on the perspective myth of the central eye. The spectator must see and this structuring vision is the condition of the possibility of the disposition of the images via the relay of char- acter look and viewpoint which pulls together vision and narrative. . . . the whole Quattrocento system is built on the establishment of point of view, the central position of the eye, and in so far as the mode of representation thus defined brings with it fixity and move- ment in a systematic complicity of interaction-brings with it, that is, the "objective" and the "subjective", the "third person" and the "first person", the view and its partial points, and finds this drama of vision as the resolving action of its narrative (pp. 48-49). Heath devotes more of his analysis to point-of-view editing than to any other technique. But for each technique, his explication is the same; insofar as a technique subserves a narrative function, it promotes coherence and meaning and positions a subject. Thus, synchronous sound dialogue is described as the equivalent of the look because it is an increment in representing narratively in- 33. Barry Salt, "Film Style and Technology in the Forties," Film Quarterly (Fall 1977). 119</page><page sequence="32">OCTOBER telligible human action. Narrative holds a film together and maintains the illu- sion of the central subject position, initiated by perspective, in force; each device of narrative film technique participates in maintaining this effect. Heath's conception of the relation between perspective and narrative in film is not without problems. To begin with, his argument rests on the dubious assertion that the perspective effect is endangered by cinematic movement. But there is no evidence that movement in film, of any of the sorts discussed, causes any perceptual confusion or unclarity. Nor is this lack of evidence due to the fact that most people usually watch narratively stabilized films. With regard to editing, for example, the final row of replacement images in Zorn's Lemma is easily comprehended by normal viewers despite the renewal of the station point from shot to shot. Film viewers will sometimes report confusion or disturbance if certain kinds of shots are edited together too rapidly. The effect may be to animate the contours in these shots and to leave the impression of tumult in the images. Yet this is not caused by the renewal of station points, but by the ap- pearance of motion generated by the phi phenomenon. Moreover, this type of visual disturbance can occur whether a film has a narrative or not. Thus, since there does not seem to be any evidence that perspective is imperiled by the kinds of cinematic movement described, Heath's theory must be mistaken. He sees the narrative as solving the problem of the disturbance of perspective by means of compensating for the viewer's compromised center. But where there is no problem, there is no solution. That is, the theory is predicated on imputing a function to narrative in relation to perspective. But the motive for attributing this function to narrative and, therefore, the function itself are groundless. One might attempt to meet this objection by saying that I am misconceiv- ing the problem as a perceptual one, and that this misleads me to look for perceptual evidence of Heath's cinematic disturbances of perspective. One might say that what Heath has postulated is a disturbance of the subject's posi- tion as a psychic center and not any disturbance detectable by the naked eye in the visual field. But shouldn't something as conditioned by vision as the subject center of perspective yield some correlative disturbance in perception when it is disrupted? That is, how can this subject center of vision be dislodged by occur- rences like the renewal of station points without any trace of that eruption showing up in the normal viewing experiences of, for example, a succession of perspectivally correct, nonnarrative images (for example, Bruce Conner's Valse Triste). Heath's theory constructs a tier of spectator illusions which originate in perception-the perception of perspective and its disturbance-but which are not supported by the data of film perception. We are given subject centers that are both visual and metapsychological/metaphysical entities, and we are given their putative interrelations, but at the ground level of vision we have no evi- dence for the initiating disturbance that sets this illusion machine in motion. This is reason enough to discard Heath's illusions as theoretical hallucinations. Apart from the question of whether film narratives stabilize perspective, 120</page><page sequence="33">Address to the Heathen Heath's theory makes another substantive claim, one that is popular in film circles and one that cries out for investigation, that is, that perspective and nar- rative are systems that serve the same purpose by producing the same effect. This is a key point in a larger, extremely fashionable thesis which could be called the equation of mimetic and diegetic verisimilitude. The arguments offered for this hypothesis are very unpromising. In general, they rely upon using the same terms to describe the effects of perspective and various effects of narrative; both are said to place, position, and center spectators in such a way that spectators acquire the illusion that they are unified subject centers.34 But if perspective imparts a central position illusion to spectators, it must be granted that this is in some sense a spatial illusion - an illusion of occupying a literal place in regards to which the geographic layout and structure of the image is perspicuous. But when we read that the narrative places, positions, and centers subjects by means of narrative logic, coherence, and meaning, we note that though the terms are spatial, the illusions they purportedly describe are those of intelligibility, homogeneity, and unity and not necessarily of space.35 As an example, consider Tron. The story inside the computer world de- rives its narrative coherence, meaning, and closure by reworking a well-known myth, that of the creator/saviour (Flynn) who visits his creation (incarnated as a computer program) and who gives his life (in the world of the computer) to save the computer people (programs).36 That Tron is highly coherent as a nar- rative in virtue of this myth does not, however, orient the spectator to the geog- raphy in any strict sense of orientation. We may assume the computer world is spatially coherent (for the purposes of the story) and we may not note any con- tradictions in the space, but the coherence of the story does not map the com- puter world so that we grasp, or even have the illusion that we have grasped, its spatial structure. At best, the narrative of Tron moves fast enough so that the audience doesn't question where things are situated in relation to each other in the computer world. But this is not what perspective is said to achieve. Thus, if we indulge Heath and say we are centered by the narrative coherence of Tron, we must also say that this is a different "center" than the one given by perspec- tive. It has a different purpose, different structure, different conditions, and a different effect. To speak as though narrative and perspective are doing the 34. Heath's description of everything- film devices, whole films, and subjects - with the same words -position, center, etc. -enables him to slide rhetorically from the description of a device to an effect on a subject; a centered narrative centers a subject. One can only guess at the internal structure of these cause-effect relations. Is it contagion? 35. I shall later discuss Heath's substitution/transformation model of narrative. Let me say now that that model in no way implies that a narrative has a spatial center, even though that model may appear to suggest this insofar as it relies on a metaphor of equilibrium. 36. This myth is also connected with other cultural cliches. Salvation comes with "free access" to the computer which obviously stands for "free market" so that the message of Tron is "Capital- ism saves." 121</page><page sequence="34">OCTOBER same thing is pure nonsense.37 Furthermore, Tron is not exceptional in terms of its propagation of narrative space; it is, despite its sci-fi trappings, quite conventional. We may say that perspective makes space coherent and that narrative makes a series of human actions coherent without granting that making some- thing coherent is always accomplishing the same task. The deduction "p or q, not q, therefore p" makes logical sense. In Heath's vocabulary, it would posi- tion (and probably even center!) a subject, but this positioning is not equatable with the perspective effect. To say this is to imply that everything that imbues coherence is the same. But this makes the prospects of ever saying anything theoretically useful about different types of coherence dim. Narratives, per- spective, counterpoint, rhymes, mathematical theorems will all be grouped together in such a way that we will never understand what is special about each of them. An analogy can be drawn between the preceding disjunctive syllogism and the various logical structures of narrative, enabling us to say that just as the syllogism has no perspectival center so a narrative structure need not have a center in the strict orientational sense that perspective does. But it may be argued that my analogy is poor on the grounds that narratives always refer to space. Of course, this is false-can't we write a structurally replete narrative about the time a bodyless God got the blues? I do not deny that most film nar- ratives concern actions that occur in space. But the question is whether narra- tive structures organize space in the way perspective does. For example, most narrative film editing does not orient the spectator to the space of the film; rather the spectator assumes the space is coherent unless there are glaring in- consistencies in it. This is quite different from the absolutely explicit organiza- tion of space by pictorial perspective. To summarize, narratives do not neces- sarily involve space, and even when narrative films do involve space they do not rigorously organize that space in a way that can be mapped with any preci- sion (at most, in the standard case, care is only taken to avoid suggesting the space is unmappable). Thus, narrative is not to be equated with perspective. Moreover, narratives also promote a range of not-necessarily-spatial effects- the closure effect, the meaning effect- which are not only distinct from each other but distinct from the perspective effect. Heath, because of his jargon, treats all narrative effects as if they were spatial effects, indeed as if they were all spatial effects equivalent to the perspective effect. But this is to offer a theo- retical blur where we need a taxonomy. Heath attempts to buoy his account of the perspective/narrative relation by citing an argument which states that narrative is the correlative of perspec- 37. Heath also argues for an equation of mimesis and diegesis on the basis of the notion of framing. This argument is dismantled in the section of this essay entitled "Heath's Rhetoric." 122</page><page sequence="35">Address to the Heathen tive since causality and perspective both organize space in terms of what follows or comes next in it (p. 71). This is a questionable analogy. On the one hand, it assumes that the central narrative connective is causality, a claim that in its clearest statement appears to have been refuted.38 But even if narrative is essentially causal, the argument will not succeed, for there is a problem in the concept of causation presupposed by the argument. The analogy hangs on the acceptance of contiguity between cause and effect as a defining feature of causation. This move corresponds to a Humean account of a cause: "an object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the former are placed in like relations of precedency and contiguity to those objects that resemble the latter." 39 But this definition is false, exactly because of the contiguity condition. Britain's attack on the Falklands and the US's compliance caused Venezuela to denounce the US. But where is the contiguity in all this? One might criticize the example unsuccessfully by saying that it uses agents rather than objects as its causal factors. But even if this foolhardy attempt were made, we would still have to ask what it does for Heath's larger argument, since most narratives are concerned with human agents. In short, causality cannot be used to argue an equivalency between perspective and narrative. Heath's best example of the interlocking equivalency of narrative and perspective is point-of-view editing, which he treats as a perspective system in- ternal to the film, orienting the spectator to a rectilinear space. The character in the film is at some virtual station point looking at the perspectival view of a preceding or ensuing shot. The spectator identifies with the character while also identifying with the perspectivally engineered camera. These three differ- ent cases of looking become identified through some vague process of relays, and the central perspective viewpoint of the succeeding shots is confirmed by the character's act of looking. This account, though seemingly precise, is quite nebulous. Speaking of point-of-view editing as an internal perspective system is inaccurate. The only similarity between the perspective model and the point- of-view model is that both involve someone looking at something. A point-of- view format can and most often is made with little or no respect for the exact geometric relation of the character's position and the station point of the per- spectival image the character is looking at. King Kong can look down at Ann Darrow and we can see her squirming in a shot that was taken from an eye- level camera position and yet still we know that the point-of-view conventions are implying that Kong is looking at her. A character can look off the screen with his head turned fifty degrees to the left and what he sees can be shown frontally, and point-of-view editing will still do its work untrammeled. Often, point-of-view editing implies that characters are seeing things that defy human 38.

There is no question of perspec- tival accuracy (or even perceptual possibility) here. One need only think of an extreme exercise in point-of-view editing like The White Gorilla to see how suc- cessful point-of-view editing can be while violating the geometrical accuracy of the character's perspective on what is seen. The White Gorilla is a B sound film that was made by intercutting a silent jungle serial with a sound framing story. The film has a narrator and the old and new footage are segued by consistently having the narrator in the new footage looking (via point-of-view editing) at events represented in the old footage. The geometry, as you may well imagine, of many of these cuts is often literally impossible, let alone perspectivally plausible. Yet this causes little or no difficulty for an audience in following or comprehending the film. Perspective or even a feigned adherence to its rules is utterly irrelevant to the understanding of point-of-view editing. We generally understand point-of-view editing though we probably rarely see shots that have been aligned according to the rules of perspective. In fact, perspective as a system of rules is unrelated to the generation and perception of point-of-view editing. Filmmakers don't characteristically employ perspective formulas in making their matches, and spectators don't recognize and compre- hend point-of-view editing by virtue of an intuition that the character is analo- gous to someone standing at the actual station point of a picture-indeed, within the convention of point-of-view editing, it is internally incorrect to think of the characters as looking at pictures (except in cases like Benson in Suspicion, where, within the fiction, they are looking at pictures). The only thing in com- mon between perspective and point of view is a viewer. But the mere presence of a viewer before an array is not sufficient to establish that the relation be- tween the viewer and the array is to be described by perspective. Therefore, the fact that the point-of-view editing has a character/viewer is not sufficient to establish that it is an internal perspective system, as the vagrant geometrical relations between film characters and what they see should already attest. The irrelevance of perspective to point-of-view editing can also be shown by recalling that point-of-view editing is actually an instance of a broader con- vention of editing. If I cut from an image of a person to an object, I immedi- ately suggest that there is a relation between them. This relation can be of many sorts, but one of the broadest categories is that of awareness - the person is shown to be aware of the object: remembering, imagining, wishing for, or foreseeing it. The narrative will generally specify which of these options is cor- rect. Point-of-view editing is a subclass of this awareness editing convention. It operates in narrative contexts where the spectator infers that the character is perceiving rather than, say, imagining the object. Thus, we need not search for an account of how point-of-view editing works in terms of perspective, but rather in terms of the logic and pragmatics of the awareness editing convention. 124</page><page sequence="37">Address to the Heathen Undoubtedly, there are important relations between cinematic and nar- rative space, especially (if not trivially) in narrative film. Theoreticians such as Mitry, Metz, and myself have emphasized, for example, the degree to which an audience's understanding of editing is dependent on their understanding of the story. Hence, Heath's notion of narrative space, insofar as it signals the im- portance of the narrative for the arrangement of the imagery of a narrative film, is neither contentious, original, nor unique. It is, rather, Heath's account of the dynamics of the relation between cinematic space and narrative-focus- ing on the supposed interplay of narrative and perspective-that is original. Unfortunately, it is also thoroughly confused and unconvincingly argued. IV. Suture One technical term of Heath's system that we have not yet discussed is "suture," a generic' term for subject positioning, conceived of as a "binding" or "stitching" of the subject into the film. The idea of suture was first introduced into film studies by Jean-Pierre Oudart primarily through a discussion of point-of-view editing.40 According to Oudart, when a shot appears on the screen, it is greeted with jubilation. But this gives way to an awareness of an absence, not only of what has been left out by the framing, but also of the re- verse field of the shot, the field in which the viewer of the shot would have been stationed. The viewer in this absent reverse field is called "the absent one." The classical narrative film, however, moves to efface this absence, to sustain the viewer's sense of plenitude and wholeness. It does this by putting a character in the place of the absent one. Thus, it sutures or fills in the absence. The spec- tator also participates in this filling in or suturing by identifying with the char- acter who replaces the absent one. The spectator is thus bound or stitched into the film by covering the gap produced by the absence of a reverse-field viewer in the presentation of the image. Heath is not in total agreement with Oudart concerning suture. He argues, for example, that in Oudart's usage the term becomes evaluative. Also Heath is afraid that, through the writing of Daniel Dayan,41 the concept has become too closely wedded to the explication of point-of-view editing, whereas Heath, following Jacques-Alain Miller,42 believes that it would be better to regard suture as a description of the operation which makes all signification possible. That is, discursive structures, though posing themselves as coherent, autonomous units, always require spectators to complete them. A painting in perspective, for example, presupposes a viewer at a station point. The specta- tor in film fills in the incomplete structures of the film, completing them and thereby deriving a sense that the film is coherent, unified, and homogeneous, which qualities, in turn, are appropriated by the subject himself. The film is 40. Jean-Pierre Oudart, "Cinema and Suture," Screen, vol. 18, no. 4 (Winter 1977-78). 41. Daniel Dayan, "The Tudor-Code of Classical Cinema," Film Quarterly (Fall 1974). 42.

Suture refers to the relation of the individual as subject to the chain of its discourse where it figures missing in the guise of a stand-in; the subject effect of the signifier in which it is represented, stood in for, taken place (the signifier is the narration of the subject) (p. 52). That is, a spectator is addressed by a discourse which positions him by setting forth the conditions under which it, the discourse, will be understood. This subject, then, completes the discourse by filling in its meaning. The subject is thereby bound into the discourse while at the same time under the illusion that the discourse is the complete source of the meaning. The discourse is producing its meaning by producing its subject positions, while also sustaining the illusion that these concrete subjects are unified. This occurs whenever meaning is produced. In terms of cinema studies, this entails that suture is not merely some- thing to be analyzed as a phenomenon of run-of-the-mill narrative films. Rather, all films, including experiments like News from Home, will suture inso- far as they produce meaning. Suture in film, therefore, should be studied by examining the way different discursive practices and systems-for example, narrative films, art films, and so forth-as well as different formal devices-for example, synchronized dialogue-suture. Suture, then, is the royal road to the investigation of subject positioning. As a generic operation which produces the very possibility of signification, suture has a general, abstract, dynamic structure. Discourse, which has the function of producing subject-unities, always involves absence and is heteroge- neous. In order to perform its function it hides these facts behind a mask of coherence. But this coherence requires that the subject complete the work of coherence making. This sutures the subject in the discourse, and the concrete subject makes up, stands in for, what is missing in the discourse. This engen- ders another absence, however, because the process of the production of dis- cursive meaning, the subject positioning, is not represented in the discourse. Thus, the discourse has provoked another absence (the absence of the represen- tation of the process of subject positioning) which means that the process of subject positioning must begin again. Hence, suture is interminable; one suture evokes another. How does this apply to film? In its movement, its framings, its cuts, its intermittences, the film ceaselessly poses an absence, a lack which is ceaselessly recaptured for-one needs to say "forin"-the film, that process binding the spectator as subject in the realization of the film's space (p. 52). 126</page><page sequence="39">Address to the Heathen So suture stops manifestations of absence by binding the subject into fictions of coherence. But, What must be emphasized . . . is that stopping-the functioning of suture in image, frame, narrative, etc.-is exactly a process: it counters a productivity, an excess, that it states and restates in the very moment of containing in the interests of coherence-thus the film frame, for example, exceeded from within by the outside it de- limits and poses and has ceaselessly to recapture (p. 53). In brief, the film must appear to the spectator to be homogeneous in order to produce a unified subject. But the film is not homogeneous because it has gaps, since: (1) it is edited, has narrative ellipses, and so forth, and (2) it is a stimula- crum rather than its referent.43 The film, if it is to produce subject-unities, presents itself as coherent (and homogeneous) to suture these absences by means of mobilizing the subject position which stands in for the absence. But this ruse is only momentary and generates its own new problems. These derive from the fact that coherence itself belies absence. For example, a coherence- making feature like framing evinces an excess, viz., the process of framing raises an awareness that something (an excess) has been deleted by the initial selectivity implied by framing. And, moreover, any sutured totality does not include the representation of the suturing process itself within its representa- tion, and, thus, another excess is excluded from the film. The suturing process, as in a perpetual motion machine, begins again. This set of interactions presupposes a spectator who is, in an ontological sense, a heterogeneity (rather than a homogeneity), and who is, therefore, 43. The concept of absence in this system is not useful for film theory. Very different things are called absences, from the referent of an image to what is not included in the representation of an action by montage, that is, something that was never photographed at all. I see no reason to believe that these very different things should have the same effect. I am not convinced that everything that Heath calls an absence should be so named. For Heath, all representations are absences because they are not their referents. But this way of talk- ing makes sense only if you believe that representations should be their referents. This is absurd. There would be no point in having institutions that produce representations if we expected that representations be their referents rather than stand-ins for them. And if we expect representa- tions to be stand-ins, we should not, then, experience them as absences, incompletenesses, or gaps. A cinematographic image is not an absence; it is the presence of a complete representation. The abstractness of the term absence also leads to other dubious consequences. The theory tells us that absences are filled in, but does not tell us anything about how this actually works. How, for example, can the absence of the film image's referent be filled in by the spectator's Imaginary experience of himself as a whole; how, that is, can the absence of an ocean liner in The Navigator be filled in by my sense of my complete body or by my experience that I am I? Examples of this sort are easy to multiply, but the point is unavoidable. By speaking in vague abstractions the theorist gains the patina of explanatory power, although he is really only masking the fact that the internal structures of the processes he outlines are absolutely imponderable. 127</page><page sequence="40">OCTOBER marked by absence (alienation and division) rather than by a sense of totalizing self-unity and plenitude. The task of ideology is to induce this sense of unity, which the organism, given its psychosexual evolution, is prone to accept. The evocation of this sense of unity, however, is always on the brink of collapse because the unity is constructed and construction and true homogeneity are mutually exclusive terms in this theory.44 Enter the film as ideological instrument. Like the spectator, the film is really a heterogeneity; it is a construction with gaps, lacks, and absences, but it poses as coherent and meaningful and, thus, homogeneous. Once homogeneity is achieved, the subject's sense of unity is confirmed. But this is an inherently unstable process since the illusion that the subject is positioned and unified is grounded in the illusion that the discourse is homogeneous and self-sufficient, which, of course, is produced by activating the illusory subject. Because of the instability of the process, suturing must always begin again-another suture must always come on the heels of an earlier one. The film must feverishly proffer new coherences to bind the subject, who is always on the edge of realiz- ing the heterogeneity of the film and the constructed nature of the subject posi- tion. In order to bind the subject, the film must always stay one step ahead of it, producing new sutures as previous ones become unstable. Cinematic de- vices like continuity editing, as well as narrative structures like closure, all per- form the function of suture by projecting the coherences that position and suture the subject. Suture theory in film derives from suture theory in Lacanian psychoanal- ysis. That form of psychoanalysis offers Heath a kind of metastory, or drama, of the subject's experience in language. It is the drama of the subject's parrying of its lack-in-being via its relation to the discourse of the Other and thereby post- poning its recognition of the truth of division and heterogeneity. The abstract descriptions of this drama that Heath quotes have the flavor of ancient, highly anthropomorphic cosmologies in which the subject is a sort of homunculus: this happens, then this happens, then this happens in a series of psychic events whose occurrence and order appear arbitrary rather than strictly determined by a set of general laws. Heath's theory is an attempt to impose this Lacanian myth of the subject 44. Actually Heath uses the concept of "homogeneity" in a way such that nothing could ever satisfy its requirements. Thus, if ever we have an intuition of homogeneity, we must be having a fantasy. I, for one, am methodologically suspicious of the practice of implicitly or explicitly defin- ing a familiar concept so that it cannot possibly have any referents. Another ordinary language argument might be brought against Heath's concept of unity. Someone might say that unity means "the bringing together of parts." Unity, therefore, implies parts. For someone to say that "x has unity" would entail that that person is aware that "x has parts." Heath, it might be said, is using the concept of unity incorrectly. Thus, his analysis of what spectators might mean if they say "x is unified" is exactly the opposite of what such a state- ment reports. 128</page><page sequence="41">Address to the Heathen in language as a theory of film viewing. This amounts to the citation (rather than the discovery) and description of cinematic devices in terms of Lacanian psychoanalysis. The discussion of these devices is then pursued through the formulaic restatement of the myth of the subject parrying its lack-in-being, along with the assertion that subject causation is an ideological process. Much of the book is comprised of baldly repetitious rehearsals of the myth. Films and techniques are described in just enough detail and with just enough abstract language to claim that they suture absence by posing coherences that bind sub- jects. There may be variations in the decorative elaborations but not in the basic form of Heath's accounts: absence leads to posed coherence leads to suture. Suture theory offers little insight at the level of structure and pragmatics into the workings and differentiation of cinematic devices and conventions. It seems less concerned with exactly how - logically, rhetorically, structurally - film devices make (or appear to make) sense (communicate meaning), and more concerned with the fact that they do make sense. That a particular device sutures is the conclusion of each explanation. Since suture is a general account of what makes coherence possible, it functions merely by telling us how every film device and practice is the same- they all suture; they appear to make sense by masking an absence and binding a subject. Some specificity seems required in suture explanations when the analyst names the particular absences incurred by a given device, and when the analyst outlines the way in which the device poses its appearance of homogeneity. But this is not a really compelling degree of specificity because (1) the absences denominated are fairly routine; and (2) the structural descriptions of the device's coherence involve the same key words- center, position, bind, and the rest of the Lacanian litany - for whatever device is under examination. Thus, suture theory gives almost the same ac- count for every cinematic device and practice. Some limited ingenuity may be required to blend Lacanian terms into these descriptions, but once this is done, the explanation converges on the same subject-in-language myth. Film theory seems to devolve into showing how every question can be given the same (ulti- mate) answer, the same answer given by Lacanian theory in its study of lin- guistics or of culture as a whole. The generality and uniformity of the explana- tions leave unanswered the specific theoretical questions that are asked about, for example, the different potential uses of the close-up. The suture theorist may say that the above objection is grounded in a misconception of what film theory should be. Such a theorist might say that what has been gained by suture theory is a bridge between film theory and the theory of the subject and of ideology in general. We should put aside the re- maining questions of film theory as unimportant and be happy that we now have a formula that tells us about the inner spring that powers everything. But the remaining questions of film theory-such as what are the different types of camera movement and what underlying principles interrelate them?- won't disappear when we are told that camera movements suture subjects. People 129</page><page sequence="42">OCTOBER who make, study, teach, and otherwise strive to understand film will still re- quire answers to the mundane questions of film theory despite their acquisi- tion, via suture theory, of the ontology of the subject. Indeed, oddly enough, the suture theory of film seems to require the existence of ordinary film theory in order to isolate the coherence-making structures of film and to supply the basic account of those devices upon which the suture account is then grafted. One must ask whether suture theory, in this regard, is an addition to or a para- site upon the structural and rhetorical analyses of ordinary film theory. If suture theory is threadbare as film theory, it is also impoverished as a putative scientific theory. It explains too much. In claiming that all discourse is sutured, it is rather like the theory that God makes everything happen. I ask why the flower died, the brakes jammed, and the sun rose, and I'm told in each case, "God made it happen." I soon see that this kind of answer is going to get me nowhere in understanding the phenomena at issue, and I search for an- swers in terms of the more restricted fields of biology, auto mechanics, and physics. Similarly, if I ask what makes a simple declarative sentence coherent and a structuralist materialist film comprehensible, and I'm told in each case that suture made it happen, then I begin to suspect that the answer is more general than the question with which I am concerned. Scientific theories are aimed at explaining variations in phenomena. That involves explaining not only how such and such a state of affairs came about but also how things might have been otherwise had the relevant conditions been otherwise. For scientific purposes, the theory of suture, like the theory of God, is vacuous. By explaining everything, it explains nothing.45 By account- ing for News from Home as well as classical Hollywood films, it accounts for nothing. One of the most shocking features of Heath's proclamation of suture theory is his complete neglect of cognitive-perceptual psychology.46 Part of the 45. It is a mark of the naivete in regard to theory on the part of contemporary film scholars that Philip Rosen thanks Heath for saving "suture" from a narrow definition since it is suture's global application by Heath that makes suture a theoretically useless concept (see Rosen, "The Politics of the Sign and Film Theory," October, no. 17 [Summer 1981], p. 19). Perhaps Rosen got the idea of congratulating Heath from Heath, who, in a similar gesture, congratulates Lacan for discover- ing the concept of lalangue, a similar ombudsman term of no theoretical specificity. 46. This is also a point that Richard Wollheim makes against all Lacanian theory in his "The Cabinet of Dr. Lacan," New York Review of Books, vol. XXV, nos. 20 and 22 (1979). This article is a well-reasoned, blistering analysis of Lacan that should be required reading for all film scholars. Heath inherits his obliviousness to cognitive psychology from his sources, because he merely assumes the truth of his sources and maps them onto film. He wends his way from the general, metapsychology of discourse to the particular discourse of film, moving from the univer- sal to the example in a verbal adventure that is hardly scientific. Instead of examining the data and competing scientific explanations of the data, Heath seems satisfied that the work of theoriz- ing is done by redescribing the phenomena in Lacanese. Though this kind of verbal analogizing may have some popularity in literary studies, it falls far short of meeting the logical requirements for confirmation of anything that advertises itself as science. Heath momentarily broaches the issue of cognitive psychology when he quotes the follow- 130</page><page sequence="43">Address to the Heathen aim of suture theory is to explain how spectators make sense out of films. An obvious source for explanations, or explanatory frameworks, of how subjects comprehend stimuli is cognitive psychology. But Heath attempts to do the whole work of explanation within the fra1nework of an arcane branch of psy- choanalysis. Why are no cognitive or perceptual structures included in Heath's model of film reception when it seems so painfully clear that some such mecha- nisms must come into play when audiences recognize a given film as coherent? If Heath believes that these structures are inadequate to the task at hand, he owes the reader an explanation why. There is, moreover, an important con- sideration of method here: scientific theories vindicate themselves through competition with other scientific theories, and the way to argue for a new scien- tific theory is to show that it is superior to all other competing explanations. Freud, knowing this, introduced The Interpretation of Dreams with an exhaustive refutation of previous dream theories. One accepts Freud's theory and one allows him to postulate certain theoretical, unobservable processes because he has demonstrated that his theory explains the data better than competing theories. Heath, however, does not confront competing cognitive-psychological explanations of the way film spectators recognize screen stimuli to be coherent. He does not scientifically demonstrate that the operations he postulates are warranted since he has not shown that we cannot get better explanations from research in cognitive psychology. He has only shown that film theory can be reworded in Lacanian terms. This is a literary accomplishment at best. It is also helpful to add that often in psychoanalysis one does not postulate the operation of an unconscious mechanism, as in the case of a parapraxis, ing argument by Paul Hirst: "Recognition, the crucial moment of the constitution (activation) of the subject presupposes a point of cognition prior to the recognition. Something must recognise that which it is to be .... The social function of ideology is to constitute concrete individuals (not- yet-subjects) as subjects. The concrete individual is 'abstract', it is not yet the subject it will be. It is, however, already a subject in the sense of the subject which supports the process of recognition. Thus something which is not a subject must already have the faculties necessary to support the recognition which will constitute it as a subject. It must have a cognitive capacity as a prior condition of its place in the process of recognition. Hence the necessity of the distinction of the concrete in- dividual and the concrete subject, a distinction in which the faculties of the latter are supposed already in the former (unless of course cognition be considered a 'natural' human faculty)." This passage is important not only because it brings up the problem of cognition in this framework, but because it points to a logical conundrum in the Althusserian-Lacanian position. Heath, however, never confronts these points directly. He changes the subject and examines the related but different claim that psychoanalysis might only examine one aspect of subject constitution, which claim he denies by an argument from authority: Lacan's theory says it accounts for all sub- ject construction. Of Hirst's puzzle, we are told by Heath that it is correct as far as it goes. How far is that? Enough to topple Heath's system (see pp. 103-107). I should also note that there may be another logical lacuna in the suture system. For, according to suture, the subject is both the effect and a cause of the process. It seems that we need the subject construct already before we can construct the subject position, in place (as Heath says), by the suture process. Unless this process can be clarified by differentiating various subject-construct-states at discrete phases of the suture process, there could be a real problem here. 131</page><page sequence="44">OCTOBER unless there is a breakdown in a cognitive (or organic) mechanism which can- not be accounted for except by postulating an irrational mechanism. That is, something irregular has to compel the inference of unconscious agency. This seems to me to be a methodologically sound constraint if only because the irra- tional mechanism will perforce be less familiar, more a matter of speculative extrapolation than a cognitive processing mechanism. And, of course, there really is nothing to explain by means of the unconscious mechanism, by refer- ence to the irrational, until rationality has broken down. The indeterminate- ness, contradictoriness, unpredictability, and arbitrariness imputed to irra- tional structures make them epistemologically hazardous processes to postu- late. One should not rush to proliferate unconscious processes. One should attempt to exhaust other possible, logically determinate explanations first. I am not saying that the unconscious should be foresworn as an explanatory device, but that we should hypothesize unconscious operations only after we have ex- hausted other avenues. Heath, however, never waits to see whether a cognitive model might account for the coherences he discusses. This is as intemperate as starting to explain how I know to answer "twelve" when you ask me "How much is six plus six?" by reference to my psychosexual development. Heath assumes that his variant of psychoanalysis explains everything, whether or not the phe- nomena call for a psychoanalytic explanation. He treats the central Lacanian propositions as so many philosopher's stones. It may be that Heath believes not that cognitive models are incorrect, but that they complement his own (Lacanian) model. Thus, he does not explore cognitive-perceptual frameworks for explaining his data because he believes these will only enrich the fundamental description he gives with more (rather than competing) details. But this approach raises an epistemological problem. For, how does Heath know that cognitive mechanisms alone cannot fully ac- count for the way spectators come to see cinematic spectacles as coherent, that once specified, they will not render talk of suture beside the point? What suture gropes to explain abstractly, cognitive psychology might explain con- cretely, without reference to almost mystical concepts like "the absent one." 47 47. My own approach to the analysis of coherence reception in film begins by assuming spec- tators with relatively stable cognitive processes and with knowledge of the film medium and its conventions. The combination of these factors provides us with spectators who at any moment in the film have a range of rationally grounded expectations, which allows them, through processes of tacit reasoning, to derive meaning from the cinematic stimuli. I think that if we build knowl- edge and cognition into our model of the film spectator-hardly frivolous presuppositions-we simply do not need to talk about suture. Indeed, I feel that, in part, Heath arrives at his abstract account of perpetual suturing because he begins with an insufficiently detailed picture of the spec- tator. His is a spectator without cognitive faculties or knowledge who, preoccupied-albeit un- consciously-only with subject unity, is buffeted eternally on the waves of suture. It is true that several times in the book, Heath mentions a process called preconstruction, but he does not tell us very much about what content he attributes to preconstructed subjects. Perhaps he would include 132</page><page sequence="45">Address to the Heathen In order to give some substance to this objection, we can review a brief case. It is fairly well established that subjects are able to go beyond the stimuli that they are given in an experiment and to infer the system of relations that underlie the items in the experiment even though they have not seen every item in the system.48 Subjects, in short, know more about what they see than what is directly available to sight. Psychologists have discovered that subjects are not only able to identify what event is being represented upon being shown an in- complete series of photographs of the event, but they are also able to identify, on later presentations, the photographs that belong to the event series but which were hitherto not shown to them.49 The series of photographs hang together as coherent because the subject knows the event that generates them. This has obvious implications for our understanding of film editing in which, of course, moving pictures of parts of an event are put together to depict an entire event. What makes these hang together? Why does the spectator see new shots in the array as coherently related to other shots? One answer, suggested by the slide experiments, is that spectators have a cognitive capacity to apprehend a whole event on the basis of seeing only parts of it. Also, we need not offer a psychoanalytic account of this, since the development of such a cognitive pro- cessing faculty in organisms can clearly be explained by the sheer evolutionary advantage it gives the organism -the capacity to know what is going on with only a few glimpses of an event. Cognitive psychology would endorse the postulation of an event- recognition capacity in the organism which is able to detect given event-specific invariants. If we could isolate the scanning mechanism, the event-invariants, and the process through which the organism stores and compares representa- tions, what need would we have for suture? Nor, I think, can one blithely say that this event-recognition capacity is what Heath has in mind, if only ob- scurely, when he speaks of suture in editing. If he did, he would have no need to claim that the process in question is interminable. Of course, it can be the subject's cognitive capacities, knowledge, and expectations as part of the preconstructed sub- ject, but this is unlikely. For, if we say the spectator knows the image is not the referent, knows how the camera works, understands the point-of-view editing convention, has the ability to recognize events from their partial representation, and so on, then we need not postulate that the subject is deceived into mistaking these representations and patterns of coherence for homogene- ities in some totalizing sense. Heath, it seems to me, is vague about what we can attribute to the preconstructed subject exactly because only vagueries enable his analysis of the moment-by- moment drama of the occurrent subject. I doubt that we would have such moment-to-moment fluctuations, in any nontrivial sense, if we had an adequate account of the preconstructed subject. 48. E. A.

As a working hypothesis, however, event-recognition, because of the specificity it of- fers the investigator, seems far more promising than suture. It is, in any case, up to Heath to say why such models will not make suture theorizing unnecessary. Aside from the question of whether or not suture theory affords a viable research program, certain puzzles remain as to its inner workings: why, for ex- ample, does the subject react as he does to such features of the stimuli as ab- sence, the nonrepresentation of the suture process, and coherence? I will take up some of these issues later.50 But for the time being, let us begin with Heath's account of coherence in this process. The film projects the appearance of coher- ence, which leads the subject to complete it in his quest for unity and homo- geneity. Heath's writing abounds with descriptions of the coherence-making features employed in film. These are activating devices in the process of coun- terfeiting homogeneity. They are also the sorts of devices- for example, narrative - that classical aesthetic theories have always regarded as unity- or coherence-making features. But Heath's analysis is different from that of classi- cal theorists because he sees the unity and coherence of these devices as con- nected with some totalizing homogeneity. Yet, in the tradition that speaks of unity and coherence in art, these aesthetic unities and coherences are understood by the concept of unity-in- diversity.51 That is, Western tradition sees artworks as producing not a unity or coherence that turns the work into a homogeneity, but one in which unity is seen in tandem with heterogeneity, variety, and diversity. That is, this tradi- tion is quite clear that artworks are in some sense heterogeneous. Spectators find pleasure in the tension between unity and diversity. The tension, and hence pleasure, is destroyed, in fact, if the work is viewed as homogeneous. Heath may say, of course, that the tradition is lying about what it advo- cates, and that it is really calling for the illusion of some sort of wholeness other than the relative "wholeness" of unity-in-diversity. But then we are left with the question of how these heterogeneous materials can be a source of homogeneity for the subject. If Heath's evidence for the aim of the coherence-making fea- tures in film is the emphasis on unity in Western art theory, then he cannot damn that tradition -which has never claimed that unity-making features in art are connected with some totalizing sense of homogeneity-by its own words. If, on the other hand, Heath wants to depart from the typical account of that special sort of unity that we call aesthetic unity and to argue that such 50. See the section of this essay entitled "The Interminability Thesis." 51. See, for example, Francis Hutcheson, An Inquiry Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony, Design, sections II and IV; and Kant's Critique of Judgment, "Analytic of the Beautiful," especially "General Remarks on the First Section of the Analytic." To be fair to Heath, it should be mentioned that there are some theorists in the tradition who speak as if artworks did engender an illusion of seamless homogeneity, e.g., Benedetto Croce, Aesthetic, Boston, Nonpareil Books, 1978. But he represents the mystical wing rather than the core of the tradition. 134</page><page sequence="47">Address to the Heathen unities do engender a totalized sense of homogeneity, then he must explain how the spectator systematically transforms the qualified unities of artworks- rhymes, thematic coherence, narrative-into fantasies of homogeneity, despite the fact that aesthetic coherence is disseminated as unity-in-diversity. Must we postulate that the spectator and his unconscious misreads the Western art insti- tution in the same way as Heath? How is the postulation-which functions as a quasi-law-that an aes- thetic unity or coherence entails a homogeneity, a sense of unalienated whole- ness that pertains both to the subject and the film, established by Heath? It seems, like many of his analyses, to be accomplished by word play. In certain uses, words like unity, coherence, and homogeneity are synonymous. If x is coherent it can be said to be unified and, therefore, homogeneous. But these implicatory relations do not hold for every qualification we offer in the use of these central terms. If a poem has a uniform meter, we may say that it is metrically coherent or unified along the dimension of meter, but it would remain to be seen if it were homogeneous in the special sense of "provoking an illusion of wholeness verging on that of undifferentiated plenitude." The sentence "This utterance has five words" is coherent because it is meaningful. Is it a unity? Perhaps- though to call it "grammatically unified" would be closer to the mark. Yet, if it is unified, can we say that the coherence that the listener grasps (or reads in) is, in any unambiguous way, related to Lacanian homogeneity? Hardly, since grasping its significance requires seeing that the sentence is constructed from five parts. Similarly, a film narrative will be called unified and, perhaps, coherent if its last scene returns us to its first scene, or recapitulates some opening scene as in Oblomov, whose beginning and ending presents us with a boy child's antici- pating his mother's arrival. This sort of recapitulation is one device of narrative closure. As a narrative unity-making feature, it is especially esteemed when the plot takes a long and winding path of complications in setting out this sort of repetition. We say such a plot is unified in that it is purposively coherent. In saying this we are claiming that the given series of events is coherent-some- thing we do not ordinarily experience of a series of events and something that we regard as an achievement against obstacles when we encounter it in nar- rative representations of event series. But acknowledging or appreciating this type of narrative coherence cannot be the same as experiencing Lacanian homogeneity; this type of coherence depends on a relation to a heterogeneity (here, a series of disparate events). To get from this sort of plot coherence to Lacanian homogeneity, one must suppress the relevant qualifications of the reference of the terms coherence and homogeneity, and illicitly treat the two as the same, unless, of course, one can provide a psychic model that accounts for why something as specific as a plot coherence should induce a homogeneity re- sponse. Although Heath postulates the existence of such a mechanism, the only proof he seems to offer for it is based on an equivocating relationship between words such as meaning, coherence, unity, and homogeneity. 135</page><page sequence="48">OCTOBER V. The Internal Structure of Narrative For Heath, narrative is the key suturing device in the dominant cinema. Narrative is able to perform this function because it moves from equilibrium to disequilibrium to equilibrium, the final state of which is taken to be the equiva- lent of homogeneity. Heath writes, "Narrativization is scene and movement, movement and scene, the reconstruction of the subject in the pleasure of that balance (with genres as specific instances of equilibrium) - for homogeneity, containment" (p. 54). A narrative film purportedly begins with a state of equi- librium which is disrupted- E.T. and his friends are interrupted by earthlings in such a way that E.T. is left stranded-and which is finally restored after the plot complications have unraveled-E.T. rejoins his own kind; E.T. goes home. The plot of a narrative film is a set of transformations which operate on a series of disequilibriums with the net result that some sort of narrative equi- librium emerges. A narrative action is a series of elements held in a relation of trans- formation such that their consecution-the movement of the trans- formation from the ones to the others-determines a state S' differ- ent to an initial state S. Clearly the action includes S and S' that it specifies as such-beginning and end are grasped from this action, within the relations it sustains; the fiction of the film is its "unity," that of the narrative. A beginning, therefore, is always a violence, the interruption of the homogeneity of S (once again, the homogene- ity-S itself- being recognized in retrospect from that violence, that interruption); in Touch of Evil this is literal: the explosion of a bomb- planted car, killing the two passengers. The task of the narrative - the point of the transformation - is to resolve the violence, to replace it in a new homogeneity. "Replace" here, it must be noted, has a double edge: on the one hand, the narrative produces something new, replaces S with S'; on the other, this production is the return of the same, S' replaces S, is the reinvestment of its elements. Hence the constraint of the need for exhaustion, the requirement of practi- cability: every element presented must be used up in the resolution, the dispersion provoked by the violence must be turned into a recon- vergence. Ideally, a narrative would be the perfect symmetry of this movement: the kiss the explosion postpones is resumed in the kiss of the close of the film as Susan is reunited with Vargas-the same kiss but delayed, set into a narrative (p. 136).52 52. Heath calls this a simple definition. He seems to think that it is not complex because it does not address the purported fact that the narrative cannot suture every element in the film. None of my above arguments against Heath's theory of narrative, however, is based on exploiting the lack of this complication in the equilibrium definition. 136</page><page sequence="49">Address to the Heathen One of Heath's presiding metaphors in describing the work of narrative is "getting things back into place." In the beginning of Touch of Evil, the leading female character is morally (that is, sexually) untarnished. The "disrupting" complications of the plot throw her reputation into question. The conclusion reinstates her virtue. Heath does not claim that every detail presented in a plot does, in fact, play into this transformation-substitution nexus, but only that a classically narrated plot gives the impression (illusion) of this sort of homogene- ity, and that pleasure in narratives is grounded in the tension between equilib- rium and disequilibrium (homogeneity and heterogeneity) in which homo- geneity ultimately wins out. The transformation-substitution process (which governs closure), plus the narrative's consistency (presumably its logical con- sistency and its internal cause-and-effect plausibility), plus its economy (the gun that appears in the first scene goes off in the last) give the narrative film its unity, a Lacanian homogeneity in which the moving picture presents itself in the totalized form of a narrative image, "a kind of static portrait in which it comes together" (p. 133). The repetitions inherent in the transformation- substitution process (and the logic of other aspects of narrative structure) im- bue the film as a whole with the appearance of homeostasis, the illusion of a static (unchanging!?) equilibrium in the service of an impression of homogene- ity, wholeness, and plenitude. In its films, classic cinema is a certain balance of repetition: a move- ment of difference and the achievement in that movement of recur- rent images -for example, the woman as "the same," a unity con- stantly refound. Narrativization, the process of the production of the film as narrative, is the operation of the balance, tying up the multi- ple elements-the whole festival of potential affects, rhythms, inten- sities, times, differences-into a line of coherence (advances and recall), a finality for the repetition (p. 157). As with most of these analyses, the characterization of the internal struc- ture of film narrative appears to succeed by blurring important distinctions. Specifically, every sort of narrative unity-making device is credited with the same effect as the replacement-transformation-repetition scheme. The stron- gest case for the homogeneity-instilling capacity of classical narrative is made by the notion that narratives are machines for replacing disruptions of an initial state of affairs by repetitions of the initial state of affairs-E.T. with his ship; E.T. separated from his ship; E.T. back with his ship. Citation of this kind of repetition might appear to warrant the postulation of a homogeneity response because this kind of repetition is often called "circular" by literary critics, and in the same (rather free) associative mood we might call it "static," which would bring us to "unchanging," which would be enough to argue that we have a fantasy of homogeneity (an impression of undifferentiated wholeness and plenitude). Of course, we could stop such an explication by pointing out 137</page><page sequence="50">OCTOBER that spectators who are entertained by circular structures do not literally be- lieve they have witnessed an unchanging or static image. Rather circular, static, and unchanging are really critical metaphors that describe certain patterns of literal change in traditional narratives. Let us, however, suppose the argument for a connection between narra- tive repetition and homogeneity is successful. It must then be pointed out that the type of repetitive device Heath has in mind is only one type of narrative ending. A narrative may also end in the reversal of an original state of affairs, for example, Bringing Up Baby or the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Or, a narrative may end in an event which stands in merely a consequent (and neither a symmetrical or anti-symmetrical) relation to earlier narrative states, for example, Tree of Wooden Clogs, Nashville, Kiss Me Deadly. Nor need narratives be comprised of scenes that vary earlier scenes either as repetitions of motifs or as subplots. Thus, even if narrative repetition could be connected with the ap- propriate form of homogeneity, it would account for only one type of narrative device, and an optional one at that. Moreover, there are dimensions of narrative unity that are not dependent upon the repetition or recapitulation of scenes. A film's narrative logic (the structure that organizes what follows what), its narrative economy, the internal plausibility of the film's causal relations, and the film's consistency are each unity-making features, though none of them requires repetitions or variations of earlier scenes in order to operate. Narrative economy does demand repeti- tion of certain objects and characters, not, however, the repetition of scenes. Heath treats all unity-making features of film narrative as if they were the same, and he speaks as if they all produced the homogeneity response that he attributes to narrative repetitions. But this is only the result of his confusing all of narrative's different structural unities with the type of unity he associates with the transformation-replacement model. Where Heath should be differen- tiating stratas of effect-for example, the logic of resolution from the subclass of the transformation-replacement variant-he is, true to form, congealing them. Furthermore, Heath cannot argue that other increments of narrative coher- ence, for example, consistency, can be explicated by the repetition effect on the grounds that these other devices are always subservient to the ideal of narrative symmetry. Narrative logic, economy, plausibility, and consistency can and do operate in films that do not have scene repetitions and symmetries. These unity- making features are quite independent and distinct from the symmetries of the transformation-replacement schema and should be analysed individually. Theorists have attempted to use the equilibrium model as a general model for analyzing dominant film narrative, but it is a blunt instrument.53 It is not 53. For example, Stephen Neale in his book, Genre, British Film Institute, 1980, tries systemat- ically to apply Heath's idea that genres are "instances of equilibrium." In the attempt to identify 138</page><page sequence="51">Address to the Heathen the case that all film narratives begin with a state of affairs that is restored at the end. A great many films begin with an untoward state of affairs-the goodly townfolk savaged by the cattle ranchers-and end with its reversal -the cowboys vanquished by the lone gunslinger turned avenging angel. If there is anything that we could profitably call an initial equilibrium here, it pre- exists the film either as a golden age or as an ideal of law and order. Nor need a film begin with an untoward state of affairs that the film proceeds to correct: a character may just be unmarried, for example, only to be wed by the ending. Calling this a transformation-repetition is simply wrong, as is saying that the film begins with some equilibrium. It begins. It begins with some state of affairs or some event which may be restored (if only symbolically), reversed, or merely forgotten. Nor, where the film begins with a state of affairs is it accurate to say it is always disturbed or disrupted by violence. This may be a dramatic mode of speech, but films do not require disturbances of equilibriums for the narrative to proceed; they require changes which may be neither disruptive nor violent: the male romantic lead notices that the girl next door is suddenly all- grown-up, or a billionaire hears so and so sing and decides to bankroll a show.54 Also, a film may end without restoring either initial or ideal states of affairs: King Kong, You Only Live Once. Of course, a researcher may take it to be definitional that a film narrative in the dominant tradition ends in a balanced state or equilibrium and then go on to take any type of closure as a case of equilibrium. But then equilibrium no longer has any explanatory power; it becomes just another word for the end (and, in this theory, for the beginning.) Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid achieves closure but not as a state of equilib- rium generated by repetition. If we call its ending an equilibrium then that term is merely synonymous with closure, the very thing the equilibrium model supposedly explicates.55 The theory, as stated, allows a certain ambiguity on the issue of whether the balance achieved in closure is formal (the repetition of an initial scene) or moral (the restoration of a preferred social order). In Heath's example of Touch equilibriums and disequilibriums for every film genre, these concepts are bent completely out of shape. Equilibrium can mean order, law, harmony, and so on, while disequilibrium takes into account dramatic conflict, criminality, and discord. Neale does not confront the issue of genre films like The Red Shoes which do not end in equilibriums as he has characterized them. Are unhappy or tragic endings equilibriums even though they would seem to be discordances in the system of homologies Neale outlines? Neale might say that these endings are equilibriums because they reinforce some ideological tenet. But once we begin talking about disequilibrium- equilibriums, the system seems very ad hoc and equilibrium is emptied of explanatory power. 54. Once the film scholar takes possession of a theoretical term like violence, he can begin read- ing the theory into the story of the film-finding it remarkable, for example, that the initiating change in such and such a film is literally a violent act. Thus, a description becomes parlayed into something that sounds like an analysis. Such exercises are merely Lacanian allegorizations. 55. Heath himself tends to identify the balanced repetition of a narrative with narrative coherence as such (for example, p. 157). 139</page><page sequence="52">OCTOBER of Evil, the logic of narrative and the law of patriarchy converge in their effect; both determine the restoration of the woman's virtue. And certainly the struc- ture of the narrative can reinforce the moral of a film in this way.56 But these two elements of a narrative film are very distinguishable and may not be syn- chronized to achieve such harmonious effects. A film, for example, The Circus, can begin and end with moral disequilibrium while formally repeating the tramp's initial condition in the conclusion; or a film such as Dead of Night can begin in moral order and proceed to moral disorder while the beginning for- mally mirrors the end; and, of course, there is the very common case of move- ment from moral disorder to order without a formal structure of repetition. This last case can become especially tricky for researchers committed to the equilibrium model because they are tempted to take films that restore some moral order (rather than some specific scene) as confirmations of the theory when they literally are not. Heath also writes as if the transformation-replacement-repetition schema were the same as plot resolution when the former is merely one form of the lat- ter. This obfuscation of class and subclass may prompt some theorists to look always to the end of the film in order to explain its structure, finding there some repetition of or similarity to the beginning. With enough cleverness and with broad enough notions of repetition and similarity, success is almost assured. But this enterprise is likely to miss the point of the actual plot resolution for the sake of stressing some repetition. You could say that Annie opens and closes with the titular juvenile singing, but this misses the thrust of the narrative climax: she is now rich and has a daddy whereas she started poor and an orphan. If you re- spond that the film has reproduced the ideologically predictable moral order of things, you are probably right but have switched from a discussion of a formal order based on repetition to a discussion of an ideal ethical equilibrium. Heath's model of the internal structure of narrative is not refined enough to deal with the data. To make it appear to work, one must either inflate its central concepts so that they will fit anything, or bend the evidence to fit the preordained scheme, or a little bit of both. From the viewpoint of the advance- ment of narrative theory, Heath's is a path better not taken. VI. The Interminability Thesis The current notion that texts are multiple, or in some sense infinite, is supported by a range of arguments. These extend from the absurd claim that each reader has his own meaning to a theory which holds that since each word is interdefined by others within the language system, each word leads us cease- lessly to others- as though syntax and pragmatics could not localize the mean- 56. For other examples, see my "The Moral Ecology of Melodrama: The Family Plot in Mag- nificent Obsession," New York Literary Forum, Melodrama Issue, 1980. 140</page><page sequence="53">Address to the Heathen ing of most specific instances of discourse. Heath has his own view of the infinite chasm that is the text. His view of textual infinity and flux is, like his variation of Brechtian illusionism, psychoanalytic, revolving around the sub- ject. For Heath, a film is always - interminably and ceaselessly - constructing and reconstructing the subject through the film discourse. From the practical viewpoint of film criticism or film theory, the intermi- nability thesis holds dark prospects. What consequences does it have for re- search? How would it, for example, guide one to analyze a film? Would one sit at one's viewing machine and chart each ceaseless suture as it appears? The result would not be unlike the formal, descriptive analyses of the early 1970s. Since the suturing work of the film is interminable, the analyses are equally so. It is not clear how such a mass of descriptions would lead to what Heath says he is setting the groundwork for: a materialist history-presumably marked by different stages-of the ways and means of ideological subject positioning in film. Such interminable analyses are necessary only if we accept the idea of in- terminable subject construction. But it is hard to believe that, in any meaning- ful sense, the subject is in ceaseless, Heraclitean flux. As I have already argued, even if there is a subject position presupposed by every instance of discourse, it would not seem to construct or reconstruct the subject in any sense relevant to the sort of ideological studies promised. I understand "2 + 2 = 5," so the proposition must position me. Does it reconstruct me? Not if that means it changes my beliefs about mathematics in any way. You can say my understanding of the proposition at the moment of its utterance presupposes a subject position but it is not one that I identify my- self with, nor, I hope, do others identify me with it. At best, that subject posi- tion is the name of the formal conditions that give the proposition its sense. The proposition does not construct me in any sense of lasting change. If I am changed at all, it is only in the trivial sense that I change with every moment of experience. In this sense, subject construction is interminable as long as the in- dividual lives. But this is far removed from any analysis of the positioning of ideological agents who accept and reject propositions, whose acts and inclina- tions are determined and changed by the acceptance and rejection of discourse. That sort of subject construction requires more than the axiomatic claim of the existence of a formal subject position for each discursive unit. This, in fact, is a banality of no theoretical use. The analysis of ideological agents requires the explanation of how individuals are influenced (and not influenced) by the form and content of ideological address. And outlining the conditions that promote the appearance of mere coherence is not enough to even begin this task.57 57. Heath may claim that once a theory of the preconstruction of the subject is in place, my questions about the acceptance and rejection of ideological discourse will be answered. But the burden of proof is on Heath. 141</page><page sequence="54">OCTOBER Given the prima facie disutility of the interminability thesis, it is impor- tant to scrutinize Heath's arguments for it. The basic form of his position runs as follows: 58 the film discourse presents itself as coherent along many dimen- sions. This, given the complicity of the subject in the process of suture, pro- duces the apprehension of homogeneity. This is explained by the putative fact that the subject, though heterogeneous, has a propensity, because of its passage through the mirror stage, to accept the appearance of external coherence as a pretext to mask heterogeneity (excess) in both itself and in outside stimuli. At the same time, however, the film belies its lack of homogeneity. The organism grasps this because, along with the Imaginary, it has another component, ac- quired at the Symbolic or Oedipal stage of its psychosexual development, which enables it to apprehend discursive systems and language and enables the spectator to be sensitive to difference, separateness, heterogeneity, and absence. When the film appears meaningful, or discursively intelligible to the Symbolic component of the spectator, the Imaginary component fills that co- herence in through the process of suture. The sense of homogeneity which this yields is immediately endangered by the spectator's sensitivity to heterogeneity, and the feigned coherence weakens before an intuition that something (the ex- cess) is excluded or absent. Films cannot avoid belying the fact that they are not homogeneous and that they merely mask absence. Why? They are absences as such. Photography presents the image of a past that is absent at the time of projection. Also, the various processes of film such as editing and framing entail separation and absence-they select and, therefore, exclude details (while masking this exclu- sion). Narrative structures are not homogeneous; they involve change. And, above all, films entail absence because they present themselves as finished products whereas they must, in truth, be finished by subjects through the pro- cess of suture. This process, which Heath calls the film's performance, is not in- cluded in the film's system of representations. It is absent. The film is a hetero- geneity that presents itself as unified and complete, but it cannot be complete because it does not represent its own process of meaning production. Similarly, the subject it constructs is also more than the subject position because the pro- cess of subject construction is not foregrounded in the subject construct. Thus, for every absence the film sutures, a new one emerges. The deepest confusion in this argument lies in the concepts of unity and homogeneity. At least two senses of unity are employed throughout. On the one hand, to say x is a unity is to say it is whole or complete, that it is one indi- visible unit of which it is inappropriate to say that it is missing anything. This is the homogeneity sense of unity. When Heath says that films, discourses, and subjects are not unified he is using the word in this sense. They are not consid- 58. Though interminability arguments recur throughout the book, the fullest statement of the position is to be found in the chapter entitled, "Film Performance." 142</page><page sequence="55">Address to the Heathen ered whole because they do not include within themselves a representation or acknowledgement of the total process by which they came about. They lack process-wholeness. (To expect this of the homogeneous unit is to expect it to have an almost theological self-sufficiency.) And they are not unified because they are divisible-films are obviously composed of parts, whereas subjects are constructed out of different temporal phases and operations. Anything that is constructed out of materials over time is likely to lack unity in this sense. There are other senses of unity, however. One is what we could call unity as coherence. If x is coherent, we mean that x coheres by means of some natu- ral or logical principle, or some set of principles (which need not be reducible to one principle). To say a sentence is coherent is to say it has a meaning, is in- telligible, and has a structure; it meets various semantic, pragmatic, and syn- tactic requirements. This is to treat the sentence as a unit, but not as a homo- geneity. It does not mean, for example, that the sentence is indivisible. Indeed, the sentence is coherent because its acknowledged parts cohere as a result of a set of principles. Nor is it necessary to regard a coherent sentence as a process- whole. Anyone who uses a language knows that the words in an utterance are drawn from a larger vocabulary, so that there is no need to acknowledge that process by some added operation within the sentence.59 Moreover, when we move from sentences to the other sorts of things we call coherent, it is clear that we do not demand that the principles that generate coherence be absolutely exhaustive for the phenomenon in question: that is, a set of principles need not account for every part of whatever we are calling coherent. A windbreak in a park may be coherent in virtue of its principle of circular design without that principle accounting for the shape of every leaf of every tree. Though there may be relations between these two concepts,of unity, it is clear that they are not the same. Coherent units are not indivisible, not process- wholes, and not necessarily exhaustively explained by the principle(s) that makes them coherent. Homogeneous units reverse these criteria. Most of the unities we experience are coherence units, whereas some abstract, theological versions of God sound like our best examples of homogeneity units. (Some people have suggested to me that Aristotelian prime matter and Lucretian atoms might also meet the homogeneity criteria, but of this I'm uncertain.) Almost every major point in Heath's interminability thesis depends on a momentary misrecognition of a coherence unity as a homogeneity unity. The film appears as a coherent representation, but it is not its referent; it, therefore, 59. That coherence unity must be distinct from homogeneity unity is illustrated by the fact that we will continue to regard a meaningful sentence as a coherence unity even if it is not a homo- geneity unity. We do not regard sentences as only apparently coherent or apparently meaningful because they are not indivisible or because they are not process wholes. It would be absurd to deny that sentences are truly coherent for these reasons (though this is what Heath's theory does with both sentences and film structures). 143</page><page sequence="56">OCTOBER does not literally present us with its basic causal ingredient and therefore lacks process-wholeness. It also lacks process-wholeness because it does not repre- sent the suture operation. Editing and framing make sense in the film but obvi- ously presuppose selection, fragmentation, and divisibility as well as masking their process-unwholesomeness. Likewise, narration. Heath attributes the in- cessant confusion of coherence unity for homogeneity unity to the spectator who is guided in this by the structures of the film which position the spectator as subject. But one must ask whether the mistaking of coherence for homo- geneity is attributable to the spectator rather than to an equivocation of the two senses of unity in this theory. Heath's basic line of argumentation is to take examples of coherence unity and to show that, spectator response to the contrary, they are not examples of homogeneity unity. His charge is that coherence unities pose as homogeneity unities. Also, just before coherence unities are caught in this act of imposture, the film proliferates more illusion producing coherence unities. The organism is entrapped in this interminable process because it not only has a propensity for grasping coherence unities-through the Symbolic which correlates with its language/meaning capacity-but also because it has another component, the Imaginary, which takes any kind of unity and fills it out as a homogeneity unity. This apprehension of homogeneity unity does not last long-because the Symbolic can detect divisibility and difference-so the process begins again interminably. 60 How can we tell whether this confusion of types of unity belongs to Heath or to the spectator whose response Heath means to explain by reference to this confusion? One reason to believe the confusion is, above all, Heath's is that he offers analyses of film and of representation in which he himself perpetuates the confusion even when not directly commenting on the subject's reception pro- cess. For example, he presents the following generalization: In its classic forms in our "advanced societies," representation is the achievement and operations of systems of coherence, of unity, which make up for the process of their structuration with strategies of com- pletion that mask the heterogeneity-movement, fading, difference, contradiction-they effectively serve to contain, to figure out (p. 96). But why bother to point out that a coherence-making structure masks a hetero- geneity (rather than simply saying that it unifies a heterogeneity) unless you yourself believe that homogeneity is the only true test of unity, that is, unless you yourself believe that unity has the univocal sense of homogeneity. In other 60. I have not been able to figure out on the basis of Heath's exposition why, a moment after the film is over-when it is no longer proliferating heterogeneity masking coherences-the whole suture process doesn't fall apart. This, it seems to me, should be a consequence of the claim that the film's suturing must be interminable in order to mask itself. 144</page><page sequence="57">Address to the Heathen words, Heath acts as if there is only one sense of unity where there are at least two. Thus, when confronted with unities of coherence, Heath observes that they don't meet the criteria of homogeneity unity, and he treats the former as somehow counterfeit. The unities of a sentence, of a story, or of a point-of-view segment of a film are not, however, counterfeit. They are called unities, correctly enough, but they do not fall under the category of unity explicated by homogeneity. Throughout Questions of Cinema, Heath really only accepts one sense of unity, the homogeneity sense, and he himself takes the measure of coherence-making unities, like continuity editing, against the homogeneity standard. Thus, he is always offering the astounding "discovery" that this or that coherence-making structure is only forging an appearance of unity. The problem is that Heath's use of the term unity is masking the fact that he is shuttling between two concepts while also accepting only one of them as legitimate. These two concepts of unity are not contradictory; they are different. Coherence unity is not inau- thentic. It is distinct from homogeneity unity. But this is unproblematic unless, like Heath, you believe that every sort of unity must be equivalent to homo- geneity.61 That the confusion of types of unity is Heath's does not exclude the possi- bility that it can also be attributed to the audience although there is little direct evidence of this one way or the other. In ordinary conversation, moviegoers will commend films by saying that they are unified, but they don't seem to have the homogeneity sense in mind when they say this because if you ask them what they mean they explain it by saying that "Everything fit together"-where everything, I take it, admits of divisibility. Moreover, if you countered our infor- mal film critic by saying that the film was not unified since it does not contain 61. If we abandon the requirement that coherence unities be homogeneity unities, then we can abandon Heath's notion that sentences, films, and so on only appear coherent. We can say instead that they are coherent. I think that it is indeed ironic that Heath, the enemy of fantasies of homo- geneity, should himself presuppose homogeneity as a standard of coherence. Here, perhaps, is the place to comment on two other ironies of the theory. First, if it is true that one reason the Lacanian-Althusserians distrust the notion of the subject is because, like Nietzsche, they distrust constructs and postulations, then it is ironic that they are untroubled by the notion of the unconscious, which is also a construct. A second irony pertains to Heath's film criticism. Though he eschews the role of arbiter of taste, Heath does appear to endorse certain films-for example, he finds that Death by Hanging supplies better clues to the proper direction of politically conscious filmmaking than avant-garde experiments in the deconstruction of formal devices (pp. 64-65). When Heath states his case for this film, he does so by arguing that the editing and the narrative raise questions of identity. I do not believe his analysis of editing is cogent, but, for the moment, I want to put such specific ob- jections aside in order to note the general form of Heath's argument. It is a very traditional critical approach, sometimes referred to as imitative form. It is based on the idea that formal elements echo or dovetail the content of the story. What is ironic about Heath's use of this critical strategy (which he repeats in his analyses of News from Home and Empire of the Senses) is not that it is so conventional, but that Heath never explains why the form/content unities which he adduces in his favored films are not instances of deceptive homogeneities. 145</page><page sequence="58">OCTOBER reference to the process of its own production within its system of representa- tions, I suspect that you would be told that that is not what was claimed by "the film is unified." I suppose that the type of evidence that might be used to show that spec- tators mistake film unity for homogeneity might include the fact that spectators do not follow narrative films shot by shot, but through larger events and stories. But even if spectators do not pay attention to shot transitions, this does not mean that they don't know that they are there. Indirect evidence for this is that phrases like "go in for a close-up," "cut," "zoom-in," and so forth are parts of everyday language where they are not only used metaphorically but also in informal, nonprofessional descriptions of film. Ordinary viewers of film don't possess complete knowledge of film editing, nor do they attend to every cut in a film. But this does not mean that they don't know the film is edited-constructed from parts which, in this case, are distinct shots. Undoubtedly, Heath would waive aside the above discussion by saying that he is not concerned with what spectators consciously know or believe. Rather, he is concerned with an unconscious process of misrecognition and one, moreover, which must occur. What could be the force of must? Probably it is that coherence unity is in some sense dependent on homogeneity unity. But then what is the nature of this dependence? My guess is that Heath believes that before you can have an idea of parts cohering into one unit, you must have the idea of "one." And, furthermore, the idea of one discriminable thing is based on a sense of homogeneity. And one could then say that this sense of homogeneity is acquired at the mirror stage of psychosexual development where it is grounded in the apprehension of the reflection of one's body as the first discriminable unity (an apprehension which comes from the Other, but is not so recognized, and, therefore, transmits a tendency to blindness as regards lacks of process-wholeness to the organism from the start). This account of the dependence of coherence on homogeneity is a mixture of logical and genetic considerations. I am least persuaded by the logical considerations. I don't see that homogeneity, in the sense that Heath uses it throughout the text, is more fundamental than coherence. Both coherence unity and homo- geneity unity presuppose the idea of a unit. But Heath's use of homogeneity also seems to presuppose what I have called process-wholeness. This does not appear to be a necessary element of what it is to be a unit. Thus, the kind of homogeneity Heath discusses cannot supply us with the logical analysis of the idea of a unit. The implicit definition of homogeneity that Heath appears to hold is, in fact, itself partly dependent on the more basic notion it supposedly explains. That is, coherence unity and homogeneity unity are both built up from a more primitive notion of a unit; neither concept seems "deeper" than the other; neither explains the other. (I leave it to readers exasperated with these abstractions to determine whether film theory, following Heath, should make the problem of the One and the Many an object of its concern.) 146</page><page sequence="59">Address to the Heathen Of course, Heath need not claim that coherence unity is logically depen- dent on homogeneity unity. And he does not explicitly make such a claim. Rather his emphasis is on the genetic dependence of coherence unity on the sense of homogeneity. The mirror stage precedes the Symbolic and makes the latter possible. But even if this is a viable developmental model-and I, for one, would not bet on it-why does it continue to be the case that throughout our adult life we require the constant mobilization of the Imaginary to recog- nize things as coherent, meaningful, and intelligible? Of course, I realize that the claim that the Imaginary is a permanent feature of our psychic makeup is a central assumption of the Lacanian system. But that it is central does not mean it is uncontroversial. Indeed, its supposed permanence requires proof. For even if there were such a thing as the mirror stage -that was used as a ladder to ascend to the Symbolic-it would still be logically and theoretically open to us to hypothesize that the ladder was thrown away once we acquired the capacity to process meaning. That the Imaginary was once a condition for the Symbolic does not imply that it is still in operation in our processing of sense, sentences, and movies. In short, why must we conjecture the continued operation of the Imaginary in our encounters with the coherence-making practices of language and film? Heath himself does seem aware that a demonstration of the con- tinued operation of the Imaginary is appropriate. And to that end he tries to show us that the postulation of the Imaginary is forced upon us by certain en- during and inescapable facts about all representation. Heath's argument is connected to his belief that there are certain perma- nent features of representation, language, and film which force the subject con- stantly to relive the drama of its acquisition of language. Heath's account is very detailed, so I will quote it in full. The function and functioning of the performance of representations can be grasped more readily in the light of insights from analytic work on the relations of the individual as subject to meaning in lan- guage. Such work- stemming above all from a linguistics responsive to the problems raised by psychoanalysis-recognizes an important distinction between the subject of the enounced and the subject of the enun- ciation, between the subject in the proposition or statement made and the subject of the making of the proposition or statement. Thus, a classic paradoxical example, in the utterance "I am lying," it is evi- dent that the subject of the proposition enounced is not one with the subject of the enunciation of the proposition-the "I" cannot "lie" on both planes at once: there is a division of the "I" necessary for the ut- terance to mean. Freud himself alludes to this splitting of the subject in language in his comparisons of the multiple appearance of the ego in dreams with the common fact of anaphoric pronominalization in sentences of the kind "When I think what a healthy child I was" and 147</page><page sequence="60">OCTOBER more recently the psychoanalytic theory of Lacan has been con- cerned with the enounced/enunciation distinction in its descriptions of the constitution and process of subjectivity. The passage into and in language divides and in that division effects the individual as subject: "The cause is the signifier without which there would be no subject in the real. The subject that is is not the beginning but the result of a structure of difference, of the symbolic order, and that result indexes a lack - the division - which is the constant "drama of the subject in language," the inscription of desire and the elaboration of an imag- inary order of wholeness, a set of images in which the ego seeks reso- lution as totality: "it is because it fends off this moment of lack that an image takes up the position of bearing the whole cost of desire: projection, function of the imaginary. . . ." The construction of the identity of the subject is a movement of exchange, a movement ceaselessly for balance between subject of enounced and subject of enunciation, symbolic and imaginary. In short, there is a permanent performance of the subject in language itself; permanent and intermi- nable, never finished, the passage into and in language without end and hence the point of highly developed forms of social attention and regulation, the determination of institutions to play out the drama of meaning, to repeat the production of cohesion and identity, to pro- vide fictions and images, to make sense (p. 98). From the above, we see that language and, by extension, every form of representation supposedly replays the subject's acquisition of language and, thus, the Imaginary constantly repeats the work it performed way back when. This is necessitated by a fact of speech that Heath characterizes by the "enounced/enunciation" distinction. All utterances, all representation, includ- ing film, somehow split the subject. Thus, we must postulate a mechanism, the Imaginary, which resolves the split, at least momentarily. And, of course, once we postulate the Imaginary, the interminability of subject construction follows because the sense of homogeneity the Imaginary imbues will always be belied. The crux of this story is the distinction between the "enounced" or state- ment and the "enunciation" or speech act. If this split is not forced upon the subject by all representation, then there is no reason to postulate the Imaginary as the means of overcoming the cleavage it is said to impose. The interminabil- ity thesis would thus lose its support. What is the distinction? I say, "I went to the store yesterday." The subject, "I," inside the quotation marks is the subject of the statement. The subject outside the quotes, the "I" speaking the sentence in the present tense, could be seen, heuristically, as the equivalent of the subject of the speech act. Or, to be more precise, the simple utterance "I went to the store yesterday" really has two subjects, the "I" (of the statement) who went to the store, and the unwritten "I" that speaks the sentence 148</page><page sequence="61">Address to the Heathen (the subject of speech act). Every utterance has these two subjects, and they are not the same. Why? Heath cites the liar paradox to state his case: in the sen- tence "I am lying," the subject of the statement is lying, but the speaking sub- ject (subject of the speech act) is presumably telling the truth and, therefore, is not lying (or, if the subject of the speech act is lying, then, paradoxically, the subject of the statement is telling the truth, that is, "I am lying"). Every utter- ance and representation involves this duality between logically different and ir- reconcilable subjects. And the Imaginary bridges the gap between them. This account, as Heath argues it, is extremely improbable. It asks us to believe that every sentence and every representation involves a split subject. The evidence is based on first person utterances: "I went to the store." But what about second and third person utterances? I say, "He went to the store." Where is the split subject? It's true that I said it and he did it, but what would this have to do with the identity of the speaker. Also, sometimes first-person, present- tense utterances don't imply a duality of subjects. Asked what I am doing at this moment, I reply, while still pushing my pen, "I am writing." Thus, the distinction between the subject of the statement and the subject of speech act seems to apply only to a limited range of utterances. So, why is it generalized as a feature of all languages and all representations? How can such a limited phenomenon reveal something that is true of all representations? There is a further problem with Heath's account. Not only is the state- ment/speech act distinction said to apply to all utterances, but it is said to por- tend a split in the subject, and not only a difference in subject(s) of the sentence. When a sickly adult says, "I was a healthy child," we understand him as saying that in respect of health, he was once better off, but we do not take this to mean that he has been split-logically, ontologically, or psychologically-from the child he once was. The sickly speaker is an enduring substance who has different properties at different times. The only evidence Heath gives that the subject is split-rather than merely instantiating different properties-is an allusion to the liar paradox. This is a rare (and arguably solvable 62 ) phenome- non-how can it show anything generic about all first-person utterances? It is a deviation, not the norm, and it is doubtful that one could demonstrate that anything resembling it surfaces in examples like "I am writing." And again, what relevance would this paradox have to second- and third-person utter- ances? It is true that the paradox is part of a family, called paradoxes of self- reference, which have third-person examples-"Does the set of all sets that in- clude themselves include itself?" (Russell's paradox). But what do these have to do with psychological subject splits? Indeed, Heath's examples are splits in speakers. Thus, it is hard to see the relevance of the liar paradox to most of the 62. See Alfred Tarski, "The Semantic Conception of Truth," Philosophical and Phenomenological Research, 4 (1944); and Tarski, "The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages," in Logic, Semantics, and Mathematics, trans. J. Woodger, Oxford, 1956. 149</page><page sequence="62">OCTOBER phenomena he discusses in Questions of Cinema, where his emphasis is on re- ceivers, not senders. And perhaps more importantly, it is difficult to under- stand why observations about a limited range of first-person utterances should be applied to all forms of representation, since not every type of representation possesses the grammatical system of person differentiation. Film, for example, does not, except when it employs language in the form of dialogue and com- mentary. Therefore, the distinction between the subject of the statement and the subject of speech act does not appear to compel us to postulate the contin- ued operation of the Imaginary, especially as regards film. That is, since the paradox Heath believes is rampant in representation is, in fact, not very wide- spread, there is no need to hypothesize the Imaginary as continually wrestling with it. And with that, the interminability thesis fails. Heath does not see the limitations of the liar paradox example, and throughout his book he attributes a paradox to cinematic representation based on the statement/speech act distinction. A film is always finished, enounced; and finished, enounced, even in its enunciation which is given, fixed, repeated at every "showing" or "screening." One has to think in this respect of the accomplished fact -the fait accompli- of film and the power of the image in that ac- complishment (leading to those descriptions of film as characteristi- cally an effacement of discourse; to the feeling of a loss of any his- torical sense, history constrained into the "objective," into the form of a visibility and vision, where Marxism in its practice and its theory gives a history that is quite the reverse of "visible"; and so on); the power which is there in the very regularity of the flow of images in time (smoothly, no resistance, a well-oiled defile for con- sciousness). Yet, in that fixity, that givenness of the film, there is neverthe- less, always, a present enunciation, the making of the film by the spectator (p. 100). Thus again we have a paradox whose masking will trigger an interminable pro- cess. But here it is clear that, once we strip away the unsupported linguistic trappings (statement/speech act), the "paradox" we are left with is perfectly harmless: a film is a finished product (an object in a can, the result of a process of production involving writers, actors, cameramen) and yet it also remains to be "completed," again and again, when it is screened in theaters for spectators. If this argument is accepted, the results will be bewildering. For it implies that every object made for use is paradoxical. A car that rolls off an assembly line is a finished product; but it is not completed until people buy it and drive it. But is there anything paradoxical or contradictory about this? No. The apparent paradox only comes from Heath's misleading way of expressing himself. In the preceding quotation, we are led to regard finished, fixity, and given- 150</page><page sequence="63">Address to the Heathen ness as opposites of present enunciation which stands for each time a film is shown again. Underlying this opposition there lurks the presupposition that somehow the film is "completed" and "not completed" at the same time (and we know, given the totality of Heath's theory, that the film is not merely "not completed" because it remains to perform its function of being shown, but because it re- mains to be completed by suture). However, it is not the case that the film is both complete and not complete, finished and not finished at the same time, in the same way, in any sense that is paradoxical. For these putative paradoxes disappear once we qualify our way of using the concepts of complete and fin- ished. Heath is simply retreading an ancient, fallacious argument form-one Plato relished, but Aristotle corrected. The film as a coherent structure (not as a homogeneous, process-whole) embodied in celluloid and ready to be mounted on a projector is finished or completed at the time of its release. A car is finished as a car is when it rolls out of the factory. The term of its literal con- struction is over. Of course, it is an object for use. So one might say that it is not completed until it is used. But this is a new sense of completion. It is a func- tion sense, rather than an object sense. In a certain patriarchal way of speak- ing, it is said that a woman is not complete until she has borne a child. Here, the sense of "completeness" is not that of a numerically identifiable entity but that of "fulfillment." The film is constructed, finished, and complete as an identifiable entity at the time of its release. It remains to fulfill the task it was made for through repeated showings. So it is not that the film is both complete and not complete, but that it is finished as an object in terms of its construction but remains to perform the task it was constructed to perform. There is no paradox, though Heath is led to see one because he equivocates on the sense in which we are to understand finished. A follower of Heath might balk here and charge that though I have said the film is finished in terms of construction, I am wrong. The film remains to be constructed by the process of suture. But this rejoinder only moves the equivo- cation from finished and relocates it in construction. That is, now we have two meanings of construction masquerading as one. But, of course, we can unravel this Gordian knot best by cutting it into two, noncontradictory concepts. The film is finished as a constructed object-in terms of processes like writing, edit- ing, and so on-while it remains to be used. If you want to describe its use as another process of construction - a process of reading in or suture - that is fine. But realize that these two uses of construction are different and noncontradictory. A film could be constructed in the first sense above and yet never be screened for anyone. But saying that such a film was both constructed and not constructed according to some univocal sense of construction would be prattle. Similarly, it is simply humbug to say that How Green Was My Valley is not finished, and to leave it at that, when you mean to say that it will continue to be shown to spectators who will respond with their own readings-in. The above argument parallels the argument that a coherent narrative film 151</page><page sequence="64">OCTOBER is not really a unity unless it reveals that it is a production-a fictional world constructed by a team of cineastes and by a process of suture. I have always wondered why title sequences were not enough to acknowledge the former sort of construction. But, in any case, it must be stressed that films can be called unities without being "whole" in the rather monumental sense demanded by the concept of unity that underpins Heath's argument. To regard coherence- making structures in film as feigned or deceptive or inadequate unities is to apply an inappropriate sense of unity to them.63 Heath's arguments for the interminability thesis seem generally grounded in unconvincing accounts of the metaphysically/metapsychologically paradox- ical and disunified nature of film. At other times he seems to base his argu- ments on the supposed fact that subject construction is interminable through- out the life of an individual. This is the worst of his arguments. For, it confuses interminable in the sense of "without end"-for example, the term of a psycho- analysis-with the sense of "ceaseless"-that is, happening again and again with each moment. Obviously, something can be interminable in the former sense without being interminable in the latter sense. Moreover, only the latter sense of interminability can apply to any phenomena involved while viewing a film. So why does Heath mix the interminability of subject construction in the life of the individual with the interminable subject construction engaged by the suturing devices of an individual film? Surely the former cannot be evidence for the latter, even if it is a truth about subject construction. 63. Undoubtedly Heath's insensitivity to the difference between types of unity is heightened by his commitment to deal with the entire range of phenomena of film reception in terms of psycho- analytic theory. If his theory contained cognitive psychological components, he would not be compelled finally to refer every explanation of unity back to the vague interaction of the Imagi- nary and the Symbolic. In fact, most of the interminability in Heath's theory seems to derive from the fact that these two psychic mechanisms are so poorly characterized that they can always be said to be working for and against each other. A more salutary way of dealing with coherence or meaning reception would be to build models that involve specific processing mechanisms (language and picture-processing mechanisms, for example). In that way, we could account for the processes through which the limited coherence unities proferred by language and art are understood with- out drifting into metaphysics: the Yin and Yang battle of Unity versus Disunity. That the problem lies in Heath's tools and not in the phenomena he examines can be illus- trated by noting that the same results-for example, interminability- can be generated by adopt- ing any procedure analogous to Heath's. Take two large, vaguely defined, ostensibly contrary concepts, for example, natural and conventional-and attempt exhaustively to catalogue an en- tire field of data with them. You will soon find your distinction on the verge of collapse as you un- cover more and more examples that do not fit exclusively into either category. At this point, you should realize that your categories are not articulated well enough. But you may stick to the cate- gories, and instead of abandoning them outright (as you should), you may wonder how people are able to tolerate the instability of this distinction. Then, you might effectively eliminate one of the terms of the distinction; you might say that nothing is natural-what appears natural is really conventional, but its conventionality is masked by convention in such a way that people are always fooled and that this masking must be interminable so that the game is not given away. 152</page><page sequence="65">Address to the Heathen VII. Heath's Rhetoric The style of Questions of Cinema is dense. The book is packed with neolo- gisms, pleonasms, misuses, and strained uses of words and grammar-Heath, one surmises, enjoys calling things by the wrong name-and the book has strong tendencies toward formulaic repetition and belletristic rambling. If Questions of Cinema fails to become a favorite of graduate film students, this will undoubtedly be a consequence of its prose style. Throughout, the tone of the book is bullying. Heath liberally peppers his commentary with thus, and there- fore-words that ordinarily signal the conclusion of a piece of reasoning-where there is no argument in the vicinity. The reader searches for nonexistent prem- ises until he gives up-staring blankly at the poker-faced text. Heath also tends to overuse words like precisely and exactly at just those points in the exposition where he is least precise and exact. The ideological operation lies in the balance, in the capture and regulation of energy, film circulates-rhythms, spaces, surfaces, moments, multiple intensities of signification-and narrativization entertains the subject-on screen, in frame-in exact turnings of difference and repetition, semiotic and suture, negativity and negation (p. 103). The effect of exact in this verbiage is to suggest rigor while cajoling the reader into believing that the passage is quite clear, even precise. Anyone should be able to understand it. A review of Questions of Cinema could certainly be written by composing a random selection of logically incoherent and tortuous quotations made all the more ludicrous by their self-celebratory gravity. I will, however, restrict my comments now to those aspects of Heath's writing style that have some bearing on the question of the book's adequacy as a work of theory. Most of the putative explanations in Questions of Cinema are couched in terms of metaphors and analogies. This might be criticized on the grounds that metaphors have no essential place in scientific discourse.64 This draconian view is not mine and I would agree with the contrary position on scientific meta- phor.65 But although I think that metaphors can be scientific, I do not believe that Heath's use of metaphor generally accords with acceptable scientific practice.66 64. The modern locus classicus of the position against metaphor as an essential part of science is Pierre Duhem, The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory, trans. P. P. Weiner, New York, Atheneum, 1962, especially part I, chapter IV. 65. The locus classicus of the defense of scientific analogy is Norman Campbell, What Is Sci- ence?, New York, Dover, 1953, chapter V. See also R. Harre, The Principles of Scientific Thinking, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1970. 66. See Mary B. Hesse, Models and Analogies in Science, Notre Dame, Indiana, University of Notre Dame Press, 1970, for a thorough discussion of the logic of scientific metaphor. 153</page><page sequence="66">OCTOBER The function of a scientific metaphor is to give us knowledge about some phenomenon that we know little about by reference to something we know more about. The metaphor of waves is particularly useful in physics. But in order for a scientific metaphor to work, we must have a distinct picture of the known phenomenon that is being used to illuminate the unknown phenom- enon. Heath's supposedly explanatory metaphors are often, however, as vague or more vague than the topic they are meant to elucidate. For example, the subject is always sliding and turning in Heath's accounts. These images are in- troduced to help us grasp obscure psychic processes. But forget the psychic phenomenon for a moment. Now concentrate. Soon you will ask-just what are we supposed to envision as concrete examples of sliding and turning? Is the sliding done in a groove or on a slippery surface? Is the turning like that of a rock suspended by a string, like a planet on its axis, or like the needle of a com- pass? That is, what concrete physical forces are we to have in mind? For, if we have none in mind, how can we extrapolate from them so as to understand the even more obscure psychic processes that supposedly correlate to them? These metaphors generally are so vague and abstract that they are not in- ternally rich enough to supply us with an initial picture of anything, let alone with a template with which to trace the outline of obscure psychic processes. We may call this the fallacy of the indigent metaphor. It might be said that Heath's slidings and turnings do perform some ser- vice. They tell us that the subject is slippery and in motion. But this is not par- ticularly informative unless we have a grasp of what they are slippery and in motion in reference to. The metaphor will be viable in proportion to the clarity of its focusing term. Moreover, a strong scientific metaphor should have some degree of sys- tematicity and fecundity. That is, it should enable us to expand upon it. If A and B are similar in respect to property x, and if A, the focusing term of our metaphor, also has properties y and z, then we test to see if properties analo- gous to y and z can be found in B. But since Heath's metaphors are often too vague, we cannot use them to articulate further the structures and forces within the psychic processes in question. Also, when we have a firm grasp of the pro- cesses referred to by the focusing term in a metaphor, we can use that to predict the next stage of the process that is mysterious to us. This feature is also related to the teaching of that metaphor-that is, the student can use the meta- phor to see how the mysterious process hangs together as a sequence because the student has a clear picture of the process in the focusing term of the meta- phor. But what comes before or after Heath's hazy slidings and turnings is anyone's guess. Heath's grammar is also peculiar in a way that raises theoretical ques- tions. Consider this passage which begins a paragraph (!) and which is refer- ring both to Touch of Evil and to what is repressed ("the something else") by that film: "The something else, the other film of which this film says everywhere the 154</page><page sequence="67">Address to the Heathen slips and slides: the narrative of the film and the history of that narrative, the economy of its narrative production, its logic" (p. 107). Sentences like this are not rare in Heath. Indeed, this is a rather gentle example. This one shows two frequent tendencies in Heath's writing: the omission of a main verb and the use of an inventory in which the relations between the items on the list are not con- spicuously clear on the basis of the sentence. Both tendencies give Heath's sentences the aspect of juxtaposed shots in montage. We are offered a run of nouns and noun phrases; it is up to us to put them together. We are given the elements that are to be related to one another, but we must divine their relations. For example, is everything in the above list that is not separated by commas in apposition to everything else? Is "the economy of its narrative production" the same as "its logic?" Or does Heath just want us to think of all these things at the same time? Throughout the text, we get asyndetic inventories of this sort- only longer-as well as nouns without verbs between them. The upshot is that often we cannot tell whether the noun phrases are causally related (and if so, how), identical, or correlated in some other mysterious fashion. What is at stake here is not just a stylistic quirk. Rather, these stylistic flourishes are anti- thetical to the task of theorizing. The theorist's job is to clarify the interrelations be- tween his various theoretical terms. To lay such terms out without specifying exactly how they relate to each other is not merely slipshod and lazy. Nor is it merely evasive. It is to forsake theorizing entirely. The reader is not supposed to guess at how these juxtaposed noun phrases go together. The theorist is sup- posed to chart explicitly their precise interrelations. Had Heath propounded the Einstein mass-energy relation, it would have read "E,m,c,2" rather than "E = mc2." Heath often leaves out the grammatical and logical connectives that make assertion-and, hence, truth or falsity-possible. The major rhetorical technique of Questions of Cinema is, as we have seen, equivocation; the book is a tissue of puns. As a general method of refutation, one could replace all the qualifications that Heath deletes and the desired "em- peror has no clothes" effect would follow almost immediately. For example, Heath wants to make the rather startling point that narrative is "a decisive in- stance of framing in film" (p. 13). The narrative is to be considered on a par with framing in the literal sense of the visual, compositional element. Thus does contemporary film theory attempt to equate mimesis with diegesis. Heath supports this discovery by citing the importance of narrative closure. He also feels that, in some way, the narrative "encloses" the space of the film. He wants us to think of the narrative as a literal frame. But what does narrative closure have to do with a frame? If one says the narrative encloses the space of the film, one uses an extremely loose metaphor that means the space of a narrative film is coherent in terms of the narrative. A narrative does not, however, enclose a visual expanse by surrounding it in the way a frame does. The argument -that a narrative encloses, and, therefore, frames-is therefore, not sound. For once we add its missing premise -all frames enclose (in the qualified sense of sur- 155</page><page sequence="68">OCTOBER round)- we see that the way narratives enclose is not really covered by the rele- vant, qualified generalization. By searching for equivocations, one can derail most of these analyses. Since there is an especially high incidence of equivoca- tion in Heath's work, the reader must patiently attend to every different mean- ing of a word like center or frame within an analysis. The unwary reader is likely to be unhinged by the incantatory repetition of the same words, caught in the undertow of an oceanic experience rather than led by reasoning. Heath's equivocations are encouraged by the fact that many of the main concepts in his system are associatively intersubstitutable. Meaning, closure, co- herence, position, binding, frame, center, homogeneity, unity, balance, and so forth are either cognates for Heath, or so enmeshed that mention of one licenses his in- vocation of any of the others (despite the apparent disjunctiveness of many of these concepts-to have a meaning is not a necessary or sufficient condition for being balanced, and vice-versa). This allows Heath to move rapidly from claims such as "narratives have closure," to "narratives frame," to "narratives center." And once there, he can equate narrative and perspective insofar as they both center. These associative trains run over the differences within the phenomena under discussion. But what really grounds these associations? In fact, they are not rigorously defined and interrelated theoretical terms. Rather, they are garden-variety image clusters - words grouped together in ordinary language because they share rather broad connotative qualities. Center and unity go together in the same way that gap and absence could be grouped with cold and gray, or, to use a classic example, with ping (rather than pong). These words, in short, are interchangeable because they share affective resonances and not because Heath's theory has successfully shown us that they represent the same phenomena in every case, or even in many cases. He acts as though his terms are interdefinable when they really only belong to similar emotive meaning clusters. As he arraigns veritable parades of these terms in his exfoliating, re- petitive, appositional inventories, momentum gathers and his equivocations are rushed along. But this is conjuring, not theory. A favorite stratagem of Heath's could be called the flip-flop. Heath loves to turn a process of the sort we would normally attribute to a spectator to the film. For example, it is said that the film rather than the spectator has a mem- ory. This reversal is in accord with Heath's Lacanian commitment: the subject is an effect of the signifier, or the Other, which, in this case, is the film. A nar- rative can function as the film's "memory for the spectator placed as its subject" and "without narrative, the memory of the film fails" (p. 171). Now it is cer- tainly true that a spectator will remember something that has a structure, like a narrative, better than something that lacks a structure-because the former is simpler to code for memory storage.67 So memory is dependent on the struc- 67. See Robert E. Ornstein, On the Experience of Time, Baltimore, Penguin, 1975, especially the chapter entitled, "The 'Storage Size' Metaphor." 156</page><page sequence="69">Address to the Heathen ture of its object. But does it make sense to regard this type of dependence as a reason to reidentify the efficient cause of the memory-the narrative structure of a film- as the memory itself? If the disposition of stars on a clear night forms a memorable gestalt, would I speak of the universe's memory? No matter how determinant the film is in the production of a memory, the term memory applies to a species of cognitive process. Films don't have memories in this sense. A print of The Roaring Twenties does not "lose its memory" as it gets older; films neither forget nor remember anything. It may be objected that I am unduly harsh. Heath, it might be said, is well aware that films are not organisms with literal memory faculties. Instead, he is using memory in a special, extended sense, a sense, moreover, which enables him to connect film theory with Lacanian metaphysics. But have we learnt something new about the phenomenon in question, or have we just translated what we already know into another, Lacanian, way of speaking? Such an exer- cise is akin to rewriting Film as Art in the language of Parmenides, or rephras- ing what we know of spectator responses as monad responses. Often one has the feeling that Heath has said something differently but that he has not said something different-that he has worked a truism into a muddle. If it is argued that these linguistic dislocations must be undertaken to get the metaphysics of the phenomenon right, so much the worse for metaphysics. VIII. The Cinematic Apparatus One of the favorite concepts of film theory in the late '70s was that of ap- paratus. Like many of the "technical" terms of the period, it has the air of preci- sion and scientific rigor. Just as physicists study quantum mechanics, so film scholars study the apparatus. But a glance at the wild assortment of things that are included in a jumbled book like The Cinematic Apparatus reveals that one could study almost any aspect of film and say that one was examining the appa- ratus. "The cinematic apparatus" is a phrase in search of a definition rather than a theoretical postulate that directs a coordinated research program. As with much contemporary film theory, the concept of the cinematic apparatus proceeds in a way that is methodologically backwards: first the term is coined, and then researchers struggle to find out if it applies to something. Heath has his own ideas about what is to be included under the banner of the apparatus, as well as suggestions about how it should be studied. If the phrase "the cinematic apparatus" calls up for you an image of the machinery of film-cameras, projectors, and so forth-then you have a narrower concept of the apparatus than Heath does. For he includes under the study of the appa- ratus such things as spectator response (subject positioning by the metaphori- cally denominated cinema machine), film technology, film ideology, film distri- bution, and the study of individual films. If you are about to ask why this should be called "studying the apparatus" rather than, less cryptogrammically, "studying film," you have already anticipated one of my objections. 157</page><page sequence="70">OCTOBER Heath arrives at his conception of the apparatus through a series of steps. He examines several likely candidates for the title of the cinematic apparatus, and rejects each one in turn. These rejected options include the study of the ap- paratus as the study of technology, as the study of film as business, and as the study of formal techniques. Heath pursues his elimination of these alternatives while presupposing that whatever the proper study of the cinematic apparatus is, it will be historical in nature. Heath offers no argument for this; but he seems predisposed to such a view by his purported Marxism and by the fact that the types of studies he is attacking are historical. Heath begins his assault with some general remarks about the methodol- ogy of history. He remarks that history is written from a perspective, from what he calls a theoretical-discursive articulation (p. 225). This, he seems to think, inclines various historians, implicitly or explicitly, to take a determinist posi- tion on whatever dimension of the historical process they study, so that they espouse that aspect of history as the single-cause, driving force of history. His- torians of film technology become technological determinists (this invention caused this style of composition to arise). Historians of the film business become economic determinists, or a combination of economic and technologi- cal determinists, while historians of technique see the formal needs of the medium as the motor force of film history-that is, filmmakers became inter- ested in shots of longer duration and as a result the crab dolly was invented. I gather that Heath thinks that each of these determinisms is too limited to cover the complexity of all the available data. And that is, of course, true enough. In opposition to technological determinism, Heath says, Cinema does not exist in the technological and then become this or that practice in the social; its history is a history of the technological and social together, a history in which the determinations are not simple but multiple, interacting, in which the ideological is there from the start -without this latter emphasis reducing the technologi- cal to the ideological or making it uniquely the term of an ideological determination (p. 227). Here, the problem seems to be not that technological determinism can't expli- cate every case, but that in every case to which it is applied, it overlooks the im- portance of ideology in its account of this or that event. Economic histories ig- nore the history of formal development. While histories of formal developments are bedeviled by troublesome data, for example, some formal innovations are the product of technological innovations. Given the limitations of these ap- proaches to the cinematic apparatus, Heath tells us how we might envision its proper study. In the following quotation, he begins with an attack on Barry Salt but ends with an enumeration of the factors that are pertinent to the analysis of the cinematic apparatus: 158</page><page sequence="71">Address to the Heathen Within cinema, as it were, the question of the relation between tech- nological determinants (the inventions, advances, improvements) and techniques (the standard or individual practices) in which technology is exploited is a question at the level of films: the deter- mination of the forms of films by technical elements or/and the de- termination of the technical elements by the aesthetic requirements of film forms, "technique" being the term that shifts between the one and the other. Technology itself is then always found and finally confirmed as an autonomous instance, with ideology involved- should the argument envisage it-in the creation and maintenance of the various techniques, even if (just because)-again should the argument even pose the problem-technology is also acknowledged as bound up with the determinations of economic forces guiding its development in this or that direction. Effectively, a kind of base/ super-structure model is deployed in which technology provides for techniques which are the point of the relations of ideology. The question of films, of film forms, is important and, more- over, as yet relatively unacknowledged in this context: what, for ex- ample, would be a textual analysis informed by reflection on tech- nology/techniques (where the answer, of course, could not lie in the simple adoption in the analysis of technical terms, odd references to depth of field or whatever) ? At the same time, however, a further question can be, has been posed (with consequences in return for the question of film forms): that of the applied technology of cinema, the machine, of the apparatus, in fact, with reference to which large areas in themselves, and not merely a particular technique, become crucial forces for discussion, camera, colour, sound, and so on; the question of the limits of cinema, historical and ideological, and the effects of the technology there: the apparatus as instruments, mecha- nisms, devices, and of the subject-as that history too (pp. 232-233). This dense passage beckons us not to approach the cinematic apparatus from a single determinist vantage point. It asks us to see the apparatus from the perspective of textual systems while seeing textual systems through the optic of the apparatus, which is, in turn, an interaction of technology, formal tech- niques, economics, subject positioning, and ideology. We are to be sensitive to the history of these variables, to each independently and to all of them in con- cert. Thus, if one asks where to start an analysis of the apparatus, the answer is simple: "Everywhere, preferably all at once." The attack on the various historical approaches to the apparatus is am- biguous. The attack is mainly directed at different kinds of historical determin- ism (technological, economic, and formal). But it is important to stress that this does not undercut the legitimacy of undertaking perspectivally limited histori- 159</page><page sequence="72">OCTOBER cal projects. One can agree that not every question about film will be solved by recourse to economics while also seeking to answer certain economic questions about the history of the Hollywood film business in the '20s without executing a textual analysis of Sunrise. Refuting economic determinism does not undermine the prospects of a delimited study of the economic history of the film industry. Refuting the idea that any single type of cause-economic, technological, formal-always explains all our questions about cinema does not entail that this or that fact about cinema may not be best explained by a technological, economic, or formal analysis that brackets certain considerations as not rele- vant to its domain. The refutation of any single-cause determinism might lead someone to say that there is no unified theory of film history-that is, there is no history unified by the predominance of one kind of cause-but it does not imply that narrowly focused analyses of certain events or event series in the history of cinema are problematic. Heath, however, seems to regard his refutations of various single-cause determinisms as grounds for suspecting the adequacy of any narrowly focused historical analysis. Why? Technological explanations tend to overlook ideologi- cal factors; economic explanations tend to overlook relevant aesthetic factors. That is, all such explanations are partial. They are called into question on the basis of what can only be a belief in the availability of an overarching explana- tory framework which, if it is not a unified theory, is, at least, an ultimate theory. Heath offers no detailed account of that theory, but he enumerates some of the causally interacting factors that such a theory would track: subject positioning, technology, technique, the relation of individual films to the appa- ratus and vice-versa, ideology. Supposedly a materialist history could be writ- ten on the basis of this framework, but as yet that work remains to be done. Heath himself has not started work on such a project. He has just attempted to isolate some of the factors that will go into that history. I doubt that such a history will be written. For it is not apparent on the basis of Heath's suggestions that it could be written. Nor if something were pro- duced, do I think we would get anything theoretically satisfying. To lay out the grounds for my skepticism, it is enough to begin with the concept of the cine- matic apparatus, which might as well be called the cinematic everything. It is not defined enough to serve as a starting point for theory building. If you want to analyze the workings of the apparatus, Heath's concept of the apparatus will not help you determine what can be bracketed from your purview. No theory explains everything-not even everything about the object of its investigation (Newton didn't worry about what made his famous apples tart). Every theory must put some questions to the side in order to begin the work of theorizing. Every theory must distinguish the aspects of its field of investigation that are salient for its purposes from those that are not. This is not an unpardonable epistemological sin, as film scholars sometimes intimate; it is simply a fact about theories and explanations. As a theoretical concept for film theory, the cinematic apparatus is bogus 160</page><page sequence="73">Address to the Heathen because it does not tell you what is excluded from your area of research. Conse- quently, if your task is to write a theoretically informed history of the appara- tus, you will have to attempt to chronicle every influence of every element in the apparatus on every other element. This history will be awesomely detailed but it will have little shape. For though Heath extravagantly indicates the in- gredients of the apparatus, his formulation is little more than a cosmic shop- ping list. He tells future historians the variables and perspectives they should keep in mind, but he is vague about the hierarchy or priority that should obtain among these perspectives. This not only leaves us puzzled about which rela- tions and lines of influence are important, but also about where to start tracing the lines of influence between all the variables enumerated. Is any point as good a starting point as any other since all roads lead back to the apparatus (as it is inchoately defined) ? The only directions one can glean for beginning the recommended history of the apparatus involve the cataloguing of all the interactions of the variables presented, from various perspectives-the technological, formal, ideological, psychological, economic, as well as from the viewpoint of the analysis of indi- vidual "film-texts." The result would be all-inclusive. It would be an encyclo- pedic report, a relentless account of every phase of film history, taken from every angle. It is unlikely that this could be written. To produce either a theory or a theoretically informed history, you have to start with something-rather than everything-that you want to know, and that something will guide your research. You can neither ask nor answer everything at once, though that seems to be what Heath is telling us to do. And if this advice leads to any ac- count, it will be a cognitively indigestible one. The all-inclusiveness of Heath's recommendations reveals a general tendency of his mode of theorizing. He seems to believe that a theory should ideally be ontologically comprehensive -that it should report on all and every- thing that really is in its field of research-rather than that it should merely be pragmatic. In his discussion of the various approaches to the apparatus, he pre- sumes that it is sufficient to reject an approach by showing that there is some aspect of the history of film that an explanation of a given sort leaves out. In- stead, he urges us to grasp Spinoza-like the history of film from a multitude of perspectives, for anything short of a full picture of the total reality of film is in- adequate. The proper approach to the apparatus will be ontologically accurate, which means that it will include reference to every interacting element and level in the system. Heath appears to think that a theoretical account of film should be a mirror of its total reality, noting all the continuities and discontinu- ities therein. And it is in this respect that I would call Heath an ontologist as regards the role of theory. I question whether ontological comprehensiveness of this sort is either a necessary or a desirable feature of any theory. I surmise that it is not a neces- sary feature since it is not a feature of most theories. The ecological theory that explains the killing of certain animals, say reindeer, by other animals, say 161</page><page sequence="74">OCTOBER wolves, in terms of the population ratios between predators and prey does not give us an ontologically comprehensive picture of all the relations between the reindeer and the wolves of a given region. It does not even give us an ontologi- cally comprehensive picture of the relation of each dead reindeer to each re- spectively satiated wolf. If you ask why that half-eaten reindeer is dead, the theory says because the wolf population is large relative to the reindeer popula- tion. This explanation, of course, excludes many facts about the death of the particular reindeer, for example, that the reindeer was upwind of the wolf who ate it. Yet, it is a perfectly good explanation for answering certain questions, viz., "Why is the reindeer dead?" (as opposed to why did the reindeer die when and where he did?). Explanations, as this example illustrates, address specific questions and in the process they select their own appropriate level of generality. And this is why they are not ontologically comprehensive. Theories do not offer a portrait of every element and level of interaction in their field of study. If they did they would not be able to answer the specific questions they are designed to deal with. That is, theories typically screen out vast portions of the available data including all manner of causal relations. And theories do this in order to supply answers to the questions that concern them. Ontological comprehensiveness is not necessary for a theory, and it may even be a detriment in a putative theory; it may clutter the theory with too many details to supply an illuminating answer to its questions. Theories are prag- matic; they serve specific purposes; they supply specific answers to specific questions. This is the point of a theory; theories are not made to mirror reality in all its richness. If Heath criticizes theories because they fail in this regard, or if he proposes a theoretical research program to achieve this end, then he just doesn't understand what a theory is. And if film scholars mistake the exorbitant demands of Heath's framework as a truly rigorous standard for dealing with the apparatus, then they are foolishly accepting a metaphysical yearning for a com- prehensive vision of reality in place of the more moderate pragmatic, logical, and epistemological requirements of theorizing. I said earlier that Heath's taste for ontologically comprehensive theories is a general tendency of his approach. So far I have only shown its relevance to his recommendations about the cinematic apparatus. But I think it also sur- faces in both the theory of interminable suture, and in his applications of that theory in certain analyses he performs on individual films. That is, the theory of interminable suture invites analysts to essay what I called micro-descriptions of the wealth of proliferating sutures of a given film or film segment. And this tendency is, in fact, borne out in parts of Heath's own work, most notably his monograph-scale study of Touch of Evil,68 but in other places as well, such as 68. Heath, "Film and System: Terms of Analysis," Screen, vol. 16, no. 1 (Spring 1975), pp. 7-77; and vol. 16, no. 2 (Summer 1975) pp. 91-113; additional note, "Touch of Evil-the long version," Screen, vol. 17, no. 1 (Spring 1976), pp. 115-117. 162</page><page sequence="75">Address to the Heathen the analysis of the scene from Suspicion (pp. 19-24). But why would one con- struct a theory whose primary virtue seems to be that it enables us to describe what it identifies as every fluctuation in the film-viewing process unless one took the role of theory to be to facilitate the accurate portrayal of the moment- by-moment process engaged by film viewing? Moreover, such a project seems justifiable only if one believes that theoretical knowledge about films can be ac- quired only when we can account for the moment-by-moment details of their viewing. It may be argued that the preceding is unjust - that it makes Heath's system sound like a mass of descriptions unconnected by any summary laws or explanatory principles. And this is not true. There is the story of suture and subject positioning which imparts some order to Heath's approach. But, as I have already argued, the level of explanation afforded by suture is unaccept- ably abstract; it flattens all the diverse data of film into one interminably repe- titious process. Its hyper-generality is enfeebling. Thus, Heath's theory seems to pull in two different directions. On the one hand, suture theory is too ab- stract to provide satisfying explanations (indeed, it is so general as to be vacu- ous). On the other hand, the research program Heath offers in terms of micro- descriptions of the moment-to-moment film viewing situation and the charting of all the interrelations of elements and levels of the cinematic apparatus is im- practicable because it sacrifices focus for detail. Heath's theory is uninforma- tive both because his central explanatory principles are threadbare, and because his drive for ontological inclusiveness produces a research program that is shapeless. He gives us too little, and he wants too much. His theory never set- tles on a fruitful level of generality. 163</page></plain_text>
