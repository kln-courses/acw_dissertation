<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folk Elements in Burmese Buddhism. By MAUNG HTIN AUNG. Pp. xiii + 140. London: Ox- FORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1962. $2.90. Dr. Maung Htin Aung, Professor at the Univer- sity of Rangoon, is an eminent specialist of Bur- mese folklore. This book is mainly a collection of lectures given to the Burma Research Society of Rangoon from 1952 to 1957. In the Foreword, U Po Tha, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering in the -University of Rangoon, presents the author, who is well equipped, both because of his origin as well as his studies, to appreciate and understand Burmese folklore. The first chapter, "Folk elements in Burmese Buddhism" sketches the religious circumstances when King Anawrahta, in the eleventh century, made Theravada Buddhism the national religion of Burma. At that time, there was a mixture of popular worship of Nat spirits, astrology, alchemy, magic, sorcery and distorted Mlahdydna and Tan- tric Buddhism, which was under the patronage of the Ari monks. Numerous elements of this old religion still subsist, amalgamated with Theravada Buddhism. The second chapter treats the Nine Gods, more precisely the ceremony consecrated to them when there is sickness. In a diagram a special priest places the images of eight Arahats surrounding the Buddha, then the images of the gods of nine planets, each of them in a position strictly deter- minated by the cardinal directions, and then the figures of the five Great Gods, of Hindu origin. These elements and those of the ceremony are a striking example of a mixture of religious beliefs and rites from very different origins. In the second chapter, the author describes the Feast of the New Year, which reflects the same characteristics as the preceding one, and he briefly compares it with the similar feast in Thailand. The following chapter is devoted to an elucida- tion of the principles of Burmese alchemy, which is derived from India. The wealth of Burma in minerals may be a good reason for the importance attained by alchemy in this country. Its main goal was to achieve an eternally youthful body, and thus to overcome death. The cult of Magus is the subject of the fifth chapter. Its patron was the legendary monk Master Goat-Bull, whose folk-tale is given at the beginning. Accounts of the legends of Dhamma- zedi, Master of Runes, and Maung Aung, Master Victory, who were historical personages, follow. The sixth chapter treats of the Lord of the Great Mountain, the god of Mount Popa which stands alone in the plain of Myingyan. The legend</page><page sequence="2">464 Journal of the American Oriental Society, 84.4 (1964) of this god is tied to the ancient history of the kingdom of Pagan whose worship was established there as a national cult. The great king Ana- wrahta tried to suppress this worship, but he finally allowed it to survive with modifications; and in this way the Lord of the Great Mountain be- came the guardian Nat of every Burmese house- hold. The Festival of Lights is connected with this cult. In the seventh chapter, the author describes the Thirty-seven Lords, one by one, analyzing them, and explaining the tragic character of their deaths, their authority and anthropomorphic nature. They are considered as the divine protectors of the Bur- mese people. The appendix offers a brief study of the cult of the Nagas, the snake-like beings well known in the Indian folklore, who were adopted by popular Buddhism. The initiation ceremonies are described in the eighth chapter. To-day, there are only two such ceremonies, the Sinbyu and the Ear-boring. The first marks the entry of a boy into the Buddhist order of monks, and the second the boring of a girls ears so that she will be able to wear earrings. The Sinbyu ceremony is analyzed in detail, by re- searching pre-Buddhist elements, its social signifi- cance and other factors. Dr. Htin Aung demon- strates that the pre-Buddhist initiation ceremony was probably part of a harvest festival, a fertility ritual. It is tied to the cult of a goddess, whose nature combines characteristics of the Friday planet and of a primitive goddess of fertility. The last chapter treats of the Ari monks and the introduction of Buddhism. The Ari monks were a heretical Buddhist sect whose beliefs and rites are not well known to us. The author tries to throw light on them-on their origin, their opinions, their practices, their worship and their history-but numerous points remain obscure or conjectural. A short Bibliography is given at the end of the book. This work of Dr. Htin Aung is a valuable con- tribution to Buddhistic studies as a whole, and not restricted to the knowledge of Burmese Buddhism. Indeed, some of the folk elements he expounds and explains are not peculiar to Burma but are found, more or less transformed, in other forms of Bud- dhism. Moreover, he shows how Buddhism has assimilated these elements and how it has adapted itself to them-a comprehension of which is valu- able for the understanding of its variants in other countries. Consequently, the contents of this book can be compared profitably with the results of similar enquiries made in the various countries where Buddhism exists.
