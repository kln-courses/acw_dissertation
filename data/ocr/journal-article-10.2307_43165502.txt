<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alternatives in Reading ILLA PODENDORF Former Chairman Science Department Laboratory School University of Chicago Chicago, Illinois IT teacher IS not say uncommon "I would like to hear to use a teacher say "I would like to use one of the newer science programs but I feel I need a textbook" or "I feel children must have something to read" or "I feel that children need experiences in reading in all sub- jects." The teachers who make such statements are basically correct. Children do need science books but this does not mean they must be textbooks! Children do profit from a science program which is part of their overall education program. But to assume that if a program is not accompanied by a textbook it does not promote reading or instruction in reading, is not a fair assumption. Curriculum programs in elemen- tary science such as Science Curriculum Improvement Study, Elementary Science Study, Science - A Process Approach, and others stress the importance of firsthand ex- periences, the importance of scien- tific process development, and the importance of children being in- volved in a program in a creative way. The rationale of this is that when they are involved, students learn better. The creators of these materials have put their emphasis on the selection and creation of activities and not on the preparation of materials for students to read. Many educators wfio participated in preparation of materials for the new programs believed that many of the current or more traditional science programs depended too heavily upon a textbook and/or were concerned about the way text- books were commonly used. They observed that in such programs chil- dren were often deprived of first- hand experiences and had little opportunity for creative expression and motivation. They could read about "experiments" and about the "results" or "right answers," but had little opportunity to participate in finding answers. In some cases the teacher would demonstrate the activity described in the textbook with the students as observers. In the effort to produce elementary sci- ence programs that would make it possible for children to participate in the activities, question the results, make use of the processes of science, and creatively design more activities, the founders of the so-called new programs included reading but de- emphasized the use of a textbook. On the other hand, textbook-based programs are not always reading programs. Many teachers have pro- vided excellent activity-oriented pro- grams with textbooks available for reference use or program guidance. Which Program? Teachers are sometimes thrown into a conflict of values about the nature of the elementary science program and thus have difficulty in making decisions about their pro- grams. How should they implement a "new program," stress some of the values they have learned to accept and wish to incorporate, and at the same time retain some of the strengths they have seen in the "old programs"? One of the first ques- tions to be asked and answered when making decisions about a program change or revision is: What objec- tives should it serve? Regardless of how the objectives are stated, be- haviorally or otherwise, they are the guiding influence and should be kept clearly in mind when considering and implementing a science program. The statements of the objectives for the program should show a balance between content and processes of science. The objectives should be stated clearly and be well understood and accepted by the teachers of the program. Communicating is one of the basic processes commonly recognized in science and is important not only in science but also in general education. The ideas communicated should be 14 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page><page sequence="2">Sometimes symbols can substitute for words. clear, precise, and understandable for the age level for which they are intended. Communicating in science includes the use of oral and written words, diagrams or drawings, graphs, and symbols of various kinds. Read- ing or interpreting these things is one of the skills in communicating and certainly should play an impor- tant part in elementary science. It is entirely logical that reading in several of its aspects should be con- spicuous in the objectives. Alternatives to the Textbook One alternative to the use of the textbook in elementary science is the trade book, whether fiction or non- fiction. Titles of trade books which supplement the content of the on- going curriculum should be provided in the classroom and in the school library.1 The titles for use in the classroom should be changed or added to as the science curriculum progresses and selected according to the library and science standards. The reading levels should cover a wide range so all children will be able to find reading material which is suitable. Perhaps the most important con- sideration in the selection of books is the accuracy of the science con- tent. If the processes of science are made evident in a trade book, they should be used with purpose. The degree of anthropomorphism or tele- ology which is conspicuous in a book is also an important considera- tion. Authors sometimes give their animals in the stories thoughtful, kindly personalities and thus the book is anthropomorphic. A pur- pose is ascribed to an act of an animal - this is teleological. For example: The beaver slapped the water with its tail to warn . . . or . . . the little earthworm came to the top of the soil so it would not. . . . More and more trade books are coming on the market and it is less and less difficult to acquire a collec- tion of tradebooks to accompany the science curriculum suitably. There are several good annotated buying guides which would be helpful in making selections. The American Association for the Advancement of Science has available annotated buy- ing guides 2 which would be helpful in addition to the buying guides which the librarians use. Most buy- ing guides would not recommend a book that is not accurate scien- tifically, is not readable by students of the age level for whom it was intended, or is either teleological or anthropomorphic. How to use trade books in the classroom is a question to be con- sidered. Every teacher will need to work out the use in her classroom according to her style of teaching. Mainly, books must be readily avail- able. Children must be interested in the science activities and motivated to ask questions which can possibly be answered by referring to one of the trade books. They should also be encouraged to read for enrich- ment information about an idea or subject in which they have special interest. Students should learn to recognize the classroom library or the school library as one possible resource. There must be opportuni- ties for children to share their newly acquired knowledge or information with their peers. A teacher needs to set the model for students by raising questions and using the reading resources as but one way to acquire or check infor- mation. Students of all ages, and especially at the elementary levels, have a tendency to overgeneralize or to make their conclusions prema- turely. The teacher may use the opportunity to set a model by ques- tioning, reading, and demonstrating the importance of reading to sub- stantiate or not substantiate the data children have. This may lead to a repetition of the activity for further validation. It is common knowledge that interest is a powerful motivator and there is no determining how much reading a child will do on his own with sufficient motivation. Students of all ages are highly motivated by "experiments" or ac- tivities of any kind. Carefully pre- pared directions are essential to provide guidelines for the student as he starts the activity and to give him a base from which he may work to a point where he may safely make a tentative conclusion. The amount of written direction or required amount of reading is determined by the age level for whom the materials are intended. Nonverbal representa- tions are useful in prepared direc- tions for activities. Arrows, outline drawings of pieces of equipment, and hands in working position can be substituted for words to reduce the vocabulary load. 1 For a list of 101 outstanding science trade books, see pages 19-26 of this issue. 2 The AAAS Science Book List for Children (Third Edition).

Reports of activities and results of experiments must be recorded. Familiarity with vocabulary and nonverbal representations which are used in the directions for the activi- ties serve the students well in their attempts to make records of their findings. The skill that develops with reading the directions, the find- ings, and the records of fellow stu- dents adds much to their reading ex- perience, and provides important alternatives. Not only are symbols, specialized vocabulary, and more ordinary vo- cabulary important experiences in reading and writing, but the format in which the records are set up is also important. The students should be permitted to be creative about de- termining the kind of record they keep. Suitability and completeness, as well as accuracy, are important considerations. The teacher's guide materials which accompany elemen- tary science programs make sug- gestions for use in that particular program. Ideas from these guide materials may be borrowed for use in other programs. Graphing is an important means of recording data, since a graph is often more easily interpreted. Chil- dren at a surprisingly early age are able to read and interpret graphs. They are soon able to record their own data in graphic form. The bar graph is perhaps one of the simplest to interpret and the most easily in- troduced to small children. After considerable experience with bar graphs they are able to understand and interpret more advanced graph- ing techniques. The more mature the children are, the more able they are to handle the skills important in graphing. Some of the "new pro- grams" in science give considerable attention to useful conventions in graphing and treat the skill in a developmental fashion. This guid- ance is helpful to teachers regard- less of the program in use. Vocabulary building is an impor- tant objective in both reading and elementary science. Words are the medium of exchange in communica- tion, whether they are oral or writ- ten. Early in a child's life, he begins negotiating with words which he hears and learns to understand as a member of a family. His first ex- perience in school groups broadens and adds to his working vocabulary. Science has a highly specialized, precise vocabulary and new words, terms, and phrases are constantly encountered and used. Television brings a wide range of vocabulary to children. Some of it is specialized and very sophisticated. Students use many of the words and phrases they hear repeatedly, and from all ap- pearances they know their meaning . . . appearances may be deceiving, however. The basic philosophy that chil- dren learn by engaging in firsthand experiences extends to and includes using the appropriate science vocab- ulary that forms the central theme of the curricular materials in use at that time. Children should be ex- pected to use precisely the vocabu- lary that is reasonable for children of their age to use and understand. Unless the terms are such that chil- dren of a specific age level can use them precisely and operationally, then words, terms, or phrases should not be introduced or stressed. It is not uncommon for children to quote a dictionary definition when they are asked the meaning of a word. There is nothing wrong with this. Quoting a definition does not necessarily mean that the student knows how to use the word in the right context. A definition that in- cludes only what a child can ob- serve, understand, and describe and which has meaning for the child in the context of the current activity or experiment is more useful than a more generalized definition. The definitions by two different children may be written two different ways and still be equally correct. A dic- tionary definition of a leaf may be something like: A leaf is a projected growth from a stem which functions in food manufacture by photosyn- thesis. A child who has been work- ing with leaves from deciduous trees may have no understanding of food manufacture or photosynthesis. He may be more satisfied with: A leaf is the flat green part of some trees and plants that has a short part which holds it on the stem and it may be small like a cracker or big like an elephant's ear. On another occasion the children who have been working with leaves in quite differ- ent activities or in a different context may define a leaf more like: A leaf is a part of a plant that is seen above the ground , is usually attached by a stem-like portion, is flat or needle- like and many of them make a shade from sunlight. Encouraging children to develop their own definitions, however unsophisticated, is more useful to the children and from one point of view is more precise. As children mature and have accumu- lated more experience with leaves, their descriptions or operational definitions will broaden and include more information. Eventually they will be able to understand the definitions which they find in a dictionary. When examining any science pro- gram with possible adoption in mind, it is wise to first review the objectives set up for the new pro- gram. Decide what the new program should do for the students in the area of reading. Look for the ex- periences in reading and the alterna- tives in reading which are woven into the program. Look for open-ended opportunities for more reading, for more activities that are creative, and more experiences in an area where children show a lag. If a program is not accompanied by a recommended book or specific reading materials, it should not be considered a program designed on alternatives to reading. It is doubt- less designed on alternatives in reading. 16 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page></plain_text>
