This book claims to be an introduction to philosophy. The author desires to inject a greater degree of certainty into the general con- fusion that seems at present to hover over the philosophical field. He writes as one who himself has made final account with Truth and who possesses the open sesame to this tranquillity of spirit for all students and general readers alike, who are endowed with sufficient critical acumen to follow his lead with discerning eyes. The book</page><page sequence="2">188 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is unquestionably one with a ringing message; whether it deserves to be called a book of philosophy depends upon what is meant by that much abused word. The present confusion arises, the author seems to think, from the operation of too many isms in the philosophic world. Con- ventionalism (pragmatisms and its ilk) on the one hand, and ma- terialism on the other, have developed out of mistaken notions con- cerning the function and scope of intelligence. And each has its own peculiar limitation: the one fails to do justice to the law and order abroad in the world, and the other minimizes, if, indeed, it does not negate, all spiritual (particularly religious) values. Thus our present uncertainty is due to a conflict between an exaggerated individualism and an overconfident intellectualism-a conflict which, in the author's opinion, seems to have harassed the weary world since the halcyon days of the thirteenth century. The way out of the difficulty is rather obvious; it lies in retracing the centuries that have created our predicament, and it ends in the golden age of the schoolmen. What we need above all is a sane intellectualism, an in- tellectualism which recognizes law and order and which also does not invalidate the claims of religious values; we need, in short, a reconciliation of intellect and faith, "Or, oiu mieux trouver a la fois le respect de l 'intelligence et celui des valeurs religieuses qu 'au Xiiie siecle, en la philosophie de saint Thomas? I1 est donc a prevoir que le XXe siecle va se replonger dans 1'etude du Moyen Age pour y recueillir des points de vue et y retrouver son assise" (p. xiv). When once this step has been taken, the victory will have been achieved. Then will the confusion have vanished as by a sort of magic; no sinister shadow that is cast by doubt can then lie athwart the intellectual horizon, and man presumably will once more find himself at home in his world with all the filial complacency (and with all the dogmatic assurance?) so characteristic of the pre-Copernican children of light. Of course, the author has no thought of advocating a return to the scientific views of pre-Copernican days; like every one else, he is aware that the centuries are too far spent and the results meanwhile achieved are too stubborn for that. But in philosophy the case is apparently somehow quite different. At any rate, the author's set conviction is that scholastic philosophy furnishes the only crucible in which the pure gold of philosophical speculation may be sundered from its dross, that scholasticism alone is the final synthesis in which can be conciliated the legitimate claims of intelli- gence and the ineradicable demands of the heart. And how does it accomplish this? So far as the uninitiated may discover, it does</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 189 so by insisting willy-nilly upon the notions of final causes, of a First Cause, of substances and accidents, of power and act, and by saying to the intellect, " Thus far and no farther''-in short, by introducing something very like an anthropomorphic flavor into scientific concepts and by summarily limiting the scope and competence of intelligence. And all of this despite 'the valiant (and, one may legitimately query, not wholly fruitless?) endeavors to the contrary on the part of em- piricists from Hobbes to William James and of rationalists from Descartes to Bertrand Russell, to say nothing of the flat contradic- tion of such vanities wrought by the procedure and results of the sciences since the days of Galileo. Verily, "le souci d'accorder, d'harmoniser, de concilier parait 1'esprit du thomisme" (p. 206); but it is a harmony of doubtful consequences, and a conciliation that amounts to a Pyrrhic victory, so far as intelligence and science are concerned. For science has been struggling through the cen- turies, and with tragic persistence, to free itself from the incubus of anthropomorphism; while intelligence can ill afford to gain surety, however steadfast and emotionally satisfying, at the price of sur- rendering even an iota of its hard-won freedom (cf. p. 439: "La dis- cipline scolastique, qui apprend a distinguer et a preciser, peut momentanement enlever quelque chose a la spontaneite et 'a 1'elan de la pensee; mais combien elle lui donne de sfurete!"). The truth of the matter is that the title of the book belies its content. For the discussion is not concerned with establishing the supremacy of unfettered intelligence in the history of thought. Though much criticism of all mystical tendencies is indulged in, the real problem of the claims of intelligence is touched hardly at all. What the book aims to establish is the supremacy of a certain his- torical formulation of epistemological, metaphysical, and theological theories known as scholasticism-whether new or old makes no es- sential difference. And the whole survey is based upon the assump- tion, supposedly axiomatic, certainly never seriously questioned, that the philosophy of Aristotle as re-thought (and, of course, greatly improved) by Saint Thomas is "la philosophie naturelle de 1'esprit humain" (pp. 9,73); in other words, that scholastic philosophy and intelligence are in all essentials synonymous terms. One would sup- pose that the mere assertion that such is the case does not prove it; one would suppose, furthermore, that a criticism of other points of view because they are inconsistent with this assumption does not prove it. And there are many at present who think that the as- sumption can not be proved, but that, on the contrary, it is out of harmony with certain rather important factual considerations. It would, therefore, seem that precisely this assumption, if it is to be</page><page sequence="4">190 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY seriously entertained, should have been given careful and rather detailed scrutiny; and it would have been in a book devoted, in fact as well as in name, to a study of the scope and function of in- telligence in the history of human thought. Those who are hesitant about accepting the author's faith on this point may still find something in the book to interest them. Thiere are rather illuminating observations on certain phases of French thought; there are also some suggestive remarks on the really important problem of methodology in the sciences; and here and there are thrown in rather searching criticisms of sundry philo- sophical doctrines, particularly pragmatic tendencies, though these at times seem rather doubtfully identified. But it is very difficult for the uninitiated reader to wax enthusiastic over a presumably serious discussion of philosophical matters which, among other lapses, refers to Plato as a great theologian, reckons it a noteworthy matter that neo-Platonism may claim to have somehow figured in the con- version of Saint Augustine, omits from a rather lengthy chapter on Christian philosophy any consideration of Abelard and dismisses Duns Scotus with a disparaging footnote appended to a very short expository paragraph, and tends on the whole to measure the value and significance of modern points of view in terms of their bearing upon theological questions defined in a terminology that to many seems outworn. The book never transcends its initial bias; the author never for a moment forgets, nor will he long let his reader forget, the sole purpose for which the book is written, namely, to find in scholastic philosophy a secure retreat and a final resting- place for the troubled soul of man ("Pour rendre aux espris la sante et la vigueur, restaurer le sens l'ordre et du respect, on a propose le retour a la philosophie d'Aristote repensee par saint Thomas d 'Aquin. Providence de securite, Rome a encourage et commande." p. 7). For such an abiding-place presumably most of us at times sincerely long. But one is at a loss to understand how it can be found in a nest of categories long since apparently shown to be impotent in the face of the unyielding facts about whose raison d'e'tre we are troubled; nor can it be said that the author has suc- ceeded in showing how. On the contrary, the basal prejudice of the discussion seems to the unorthodox reader an insuperable barrier in the way of its logic-at least it so seems to this one. G. WATTS CUNNINGHAM.
