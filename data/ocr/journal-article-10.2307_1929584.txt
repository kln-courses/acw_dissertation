SLATIS Ecology, Vol. 36, No. 3 growth, and by Chapman and Baird (1934) for their valuable paper on the biotic constants of Ti'bohiUM con fusuni. A subculture was imported into Canada by one of us (J.S.) in 1932, and has been maintained under substantially constant con- ditions since that time. During the period 1941- 1946, owing to the war, cultures had to be left with only occasional changes of flour. The food medium has always been whole wheat flour plus 3% of ground wheat germ. Flour has been ob- tained from various sources, as available, but in recent years, Ogilvie's " 'C'-stream, unbleached" has been used. McGill Red has been checked against sundry wild strains, obtained from mills and ships, in Montreal and elsewhere. While the remarkably discriminating technique of the autotrephon does show some very small significant differences be- tween the life history of McGill Red and each wild strain (and between all the wild strains, too), the differences are very small indeed, and show no consistent trend. It is felt that, for all practical purposes, one can say that McGill Red, as it now exists, does not differ to any worthwhile degree from an average wild strain. It is largely a 6- instar strain. Indeed, until recently, it was thought to be fully so, but we have recently found a few 7th-instar larvae, and a very few 8th-instar. This somewhat spoils the accuracy of the deter- mination of the point (6-P), where 50% of the larvae transform to pupae. This point will be discussed later. At the time the data for this paper were collected, the technique used could not detect these few higher-instar larvae. The mutation, McGill Black, is an intensely black form, discovered in the cultures in 1950 by Miss Helen J. Martin, Research Assistant to J. S. -at that time. A pure culture was isolated, and has been since maintained. As will be shown later, McGill Black is not the same as the muta- tion "ebony," described by Park, Ginsberg and Horowitz (1945). LITERATURE It is somewhat surprising, in view of all the work which has been done with Tribolihm con- fusum (particularly in connection with population studies), that there is so little really sound in- formation as to its exact life history. In point of fact, though there are many papers which give fragmentary data for various foods and tempera- tures, there are only 3, to the writer's knowledge, which give clean-cut constants with reasonably small variance. Sweetman and Palmer (1928) used the insect as a test animal for vitamin research. and showed that the addition of brewer's yeast and wheat germ to the food reduced the time required for development. They obtained times varying from 20.8 days (499.2 hr.) to 30.6 days (734.4 hr.) from egg to adult at 280C. However, the instars are lumped for the larvae. Brindley (1930) published data for the dura- tions of the various stages, including larvae, at 29.70C., but the Standard Errors are not shown. Chapman and Baird (1934) made a most care- ful study of Triboliimt collfusum and their sets of biotic constants at 17?, 22?, 270 and 320C., form the main part of our knowledge in this field. Rearing was done in the ordinary way by hand. It would appear from their discussion that eggs were examined hourly, the other stages daily. If we compute as closely as possible the means and Standard Errors of the data of Chapman and Baird, we have approximately: eggs, 105.84 ? 0.312 hr.; lumped larvae, 416.40 + 1.88 hr.; pupae 128.88 ? 1.91 hr. at 320C. The roughly comparable values from this present paper for Combined Reds at 30?C., calculated from Table III, are: eggs, 116.31 + 0.63 hr.; lumped larvae, 418.37 + 1.85 hr.; pupae 142.52 ? 1.91 hr. The actual values are not really comparable, owing to the 2-degree difference in temperature, but the Standard Errors are of interest. They are of about the same order of magnitude in both cases, and bear testimony to the excellence of the work of Chapman and Baird. It might be remarked, though, that had these authors continued hourly observations throughout the life history, the effort involved would have been formidable. Stanley (1946) published a paper combining some of his own data with that of Chapman and Baird (1934) and obtained smoothed values for various temperatures by interpolation. The in- stars are lumped and no Standard Errors are shown. In general, the data, though showing in- teresting trends with temperature, are not reliable in individual cases. If one compares the data of Stanley (1946) at 300C., with those of this present paper, it will be found that in every case the values of 1946 are higher than those shown here. For example, we have for eggs, larvae and pupae successively, in 1946: 117, 482 and 160 hr. The present values are 116.31, 418.37 and 148.52 for Combined Reds, as in Table III. Part of the discrepancy is clearly due to the natural difficulties of curve fitting, but much of it is believed to be due to the effect of considerable disturbance in hand rearing and almost zero dis- turbance in autotrephon rearing. Chapman and Baird mention that disturbance lengthens the life</page><page sequence="3">July, 1955 STUDIES FROM THE AUTOTREPHON, III 475 history, and they made every effort to minimize it. They could not, however, eliminate it, and it will be noted that while the autotrephon can rear larvae from egg to pupae in 418+ hours at 300C., the hand rearing of Chapman and Baird at 320C., shows an acceleration of only 2 hr. A rough cal- culation from an autotrephon run at 320C., shows an acceleration of about 40 hr., giving a lumped- larvae development time of about 366 hr.' Rey- nolds (1945) mentions a similar effect of retarda- tion, if Triboliur destructor is disturbed. In the autotrephon there is of course no dis- turbance at all, other than the faint hum of the air-conditioning system, and this laboratory has invariably found that life histories from the auto- trephon are shorter than those found in the litera- ture. It is not intended to discuss this matter fully here, but it may be mentioned that one ex- tremelv carefully controlled experiment showed that simple daily shaking of the vials would lengthen the life history from approximately 683 hr. to about 716 hr. at 300C. TECHNIQUE The experiments leading to this paper were done in two sets, the genetical part by H.M.S. and the life-histories by J.S. There is nothing unusual that needs discussion as far as the genetical tech- nique is concerned. The insects were reared in vials at 30 ? 0.10C., and 75 ? 2.0% Relative Hu- midity.9 in the laboratory's standard flour plus 3% of wheat germ. The autotrephon could not be used for this part of the work, as it is not adapted to it. For the life histories, the samples were housed in either glass or plastic vials. It was thought initially that insects developed faster in plastic than they did in glass, perhaps due to some vola- tile substance diffusing from the plastic and affect- ing growth. It is now known that the apparent acceleration is due to freedom from disturbance, as explained above, and there is no evidence of any acceleration due to rearing in plastic. The food used was Ogilvie's " 'C'-stream, uin- bleached" whole wheat flour, sifted to pass 100% through a 60-mesh bolting cloth. The 3% of wheat germ was intimately mixed in, using a ball- mill with a reduced load of pebbles. Each sample- vial held 30 gm. of the flour, with a variation of ? 0.1 gm. The flour was weighted in after allow- ing it to come into equilibrium with 300C., and 75% R.H. This weight of flour has a volume of almost exactly 60 cc. 1 This is rough figure for illustration only, and subject to small change on LD50 analysis. 2 The use of the sign + here indicates merely the limits of random variation about the mean value. In each vial the flour was seeded with 25 new- laid eggs obtained by sifting a large culture once (to clear out old eggs), and then sifting again 2 hr. later. The spread of the ages about the mean is thus + 1.0 hr. If we assume that the eggs are laid at a uniform rate throughout the 2-hour in- terval, the eggs would be distributed about a mean age with a Standard Error of ? 0.12 hr. We can- not however be at all certain of such a uniform rate. Probably eggs are not laid at once after the first sift, and the true Standard Error must be more than the theoretical. We have no way at present of determining it, and as a compromise, it has been arbitrarily given a value of ? 0.5 hr. The instant of laying is then taken as midway between the two sifts and, for example, in the case of Experiment Red-1, the first sift was at 9.00 A.M. and the second at 11.00 A.M. The eggs then all date from 10.00 A.M., and start with a mean age of 0.00 + 0.5 hr. The choosing of any other reasonable value for the Standard Error of the starting instant does not affect the end results, and ? 0.5 hr. is the writer's best estimate of a suitable value. The use of a Standard Error for the starting instant does not affect the value of the point (E-1), when 50% of the viable eggs have hatched, but it does affect the calculation of the time spent as an egg. It is for this reason that (E-1) ap- pears as 116.86 ? 0.87 hr. in Table III, while the time spent as an egg appears as 116.86 + 1.00 hr. in Table VI. By the use of radiant heat the eggs were kept as close as possible to 300C. while being counted out, and every effort was made to avoid any but brief exposures to other temperatures during manipulation of the samples in loading etc. The temperature control in the autotrephon was ac- curate to ? 0.050C., and the relative humidity to ? 0.5'C., wet-bulb temperature. In view of the insulating effect of the flour surrounding the in- sects, this represents almost perfect control. \Vith occasional exceptions, the samples were released exactly on time. Where mechanical fail- ures made a sample late, this was taken into ac- count in the calculations. The recording system of the autotrephon marks the exact time of re- lease. The autotrephon experiments were not per- formed specifically for this paper. Rather the limits and coverage of the paper were decided, and suitable data were then withdrawn from the files. It follows that experiments were spread over several years. Altogether 5 life histories are described, 3 for McGill Red and 2 for McGill Black. These experiments were as follows:</page><page sequence="4">476 JOHN STANLEY AND H. M. SLATIS Ecology, Vol. 36, No. 3 Red-1. This is the experiment previously de- scribed in Stanley (1953b). It is included here partly to show the consistency of the results ob- tainable with the autotrephon, and partly to com- pare the results obtained by the graphical method of Stanley (1953b) with those from the more ele- gant LD50 technique of this present paper. The experiment began on Monday, February 27, 1950. It was intended to sample every 5 hrs., as it was not clear at that time what was the best sampling interval. Certain mechanical difficulties intervened with the then new apparatus, and the sampling intervals were not always correct. However, the actual times were used for calculation. Instars were determined by micro-metric measurement across the two eyes (outer boundary to outer boundary), using Dyar's Rule (1890). This ex- periment was housed in plastic, and the short life history, only 681.5 hr., led to the suspicion that there was some acceleration from rearing in plastic. Stanley (1946) had shown 729 hr. as a calculated life history time at 300C. Red-2, Red-3, Black-1 and Black-2. In an attempt to check the possibility of acceleration in plastic versus glass, these were done as a quad- rtuple run, using "linked" tracking in fours (Stan- ley 1953b), so that a set of all four kinds was withdrawn every 10 hr. Red-2 and Black-1 were in plastic, Red-3 and Black-2 in glass. As stated, the acceleration in plastic is a myth. The instar determination was substantially as in Red-1, with somewhat better discrimination. The run com- menced on November 28, 1951. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA Experiment Red-1 was analysed in Stanley (1953b), using a graphical method for finding the points (measured in hours from the mean time of laying) at which 50% of a given stage had transformed to the next successive stage. This method is simple and easy to carry out, but it does not provide any Standard Errors, and so the significance of differences cannot be determined. A little thought showed that what was really being done was to "dose" the insects with in- creasing amounts of time. Therefore the well- known "LD50" technique, used to assess the effects of varying doses of poisons, should be ap- plicable. Instead of insects being dosed with poisons, and 50% dying, insects are dosed with "time" and 50% transform. This method seas in- troduced by Bliss (1935a, 1935b), but the dis- ctlssioIn in Bliss is not simple. That of M\ather ( 1947) is clear and easy to understand, and AMlather's method was used exclusively. Space hardly permits the inclusion here of a worked-out example, but the method is briefly this. Percentages of insects transformed at each observation are changed to probits, and these pro- bits are plotted as ordinates against time. If all is well, the plot will be roughly a straight line. If it is curved, a logarithmic or other transforma- tion may be used to straighten it. A straight line is then fitted to the plot by eye, or if desired, by a straightforward least squares fit, without any weighting of the observations. New "fitted" values of the probits are then taken from this line, and used to fit a new line by a weighted least squares fit, using weights taken from a table. The subsequent calculation then finds the equa- tion of this new line, and finds "LD50," the ab- scissa for which the ordinate is 50%. Obviously, the final line must be a valid fit to the data, and the excellence of agreement can be checked by calculating Chi-square, as per Bliss (1935a). In pharmacological work, logarithmic trans- formations are often necessary to make Chi-square sufficiently small. In the case of the transforma- tion of beetles to a further stage, it is probable that the time scale does not directly reflect the ac- tions of the forces which operate in ontogeny. It is reasonable to suppose (and this seems to be borne out by observations) that there is less like- lihood of a beetle being precocious than there is of its being slow. The laggards will have a distinct effect in drawing out the central part of the plot towards the later parts of the time-scale, making some calculations of LD50 yield values which are too large. This source of error was not taken into account (i..e. logarithmic transformations were not male) for a number of reasons. The major reason is that observation suggests that the effect cannot be great, as laggards are not common. Confirmation of this v-iew is derived from Table I, which compares the values determined graph- ically with those from the LD50 analysis. Inasmuch as the graphical method was not TABLE 1.

The obviously random distribution of the discrepancies of Table I indicates that no particular bias existed which would consistently affect the value of LD5o. Another excellent reason for refraining from transforming the time scale was the lack of any reasonable formula for making such a transforma- tion. The study of enormous numbers of beetles would doubtless result in empirical factors for the correction of observations, but these would be of value only in the particular case for which they were determined. Bliss (1935a) describes two methods for this Chi-squared check, and the data for Red-1 for all transformation points except (E-1) were tested by the easier method. Four of the Chi-square values were not significant, two were significant at the 5% level, and one, that for the transforma- tion from 6th instar to pupae, was significant at much less than the .001 level. This case showed some markedly deviant samples, and is discussed below. If this single instance of a highly significant Chi-square be removed from the data, the other values of Chi-square may be tested together by adding the Chi-squares and the degrees of free- dom. The total Chi-square was found to be 36.7 with 24 degrees of freedom, for which the proba- bility is almost exactly 0.05, a not unreasonable result. The use of Chi-square for this test was greatly limited by the fact that there are biases in both the data and the analyst which affect the value of both Chi-square and the number of de- grees of freedom. We now consider the value of Chi-square for the point (6-P). At the time this paper was first written, it was thought that there were no more than 6 instars, and that the transformation from 6th instar to pupae was just that. Further work with other autotrephon runs, combined with a new technique for instar determination (to be described in a later publication) shows that un- der some conditions there may be a few 7th instars, a very few 8th, and even an occasional 9th instar, though these last are rare indeed. These higher instars are larval laggards beyond the time (6-P) and they spoil the form of the percentage and probit plots in this region, increasing the Chi- square. In reality, there are times such as (6-P), (6-7), (7-8), (8-9) and (7-P), (8-P) and (9-P). The point called (6-P) in this present paper is a sort of weighted mean of (6-P), (7-P), (8-P) and possibly (9-P). It might be better to call it (L-P) meaning "the point at which 50% of the mature larvae have pupated. Data are not avail- able for the present experiments to improve the situation, hut subsequent publications will (leal with it in detail for later experiments. The resultant haziness in (L-P) is not serious for Tribolium con fusm at 30'C. in whole wheat flour, because 7th and 8th instars are rare, and 9th virtually unknown. Indeed, the Standard Errors shown in Table III are pleasingly small for biological material. For Triboliunt castanein, however, the problem is more serious, as a fair proportion of 6th instar go on to the 7th, many of these then go to the 8th, but 9th are very rare. Although, from the point of view of elegance (whatever that may mean), the LD50 technique is perhaps the method of choice, it does not, in the case of autotrep)hon data, yield transformation points which are appreciably better than those obtained by the graphical method. Table I shows the values of the successive points in the life his- tory of Red-1 obtained by both methods. It will be observed that the maximum difference between the two is 1.86 hr., for the point (E-1), and this is only just significant. In view of the fact that, with ordinary "hand" rearing and daily observa- tions, the Standard Error may be as much as ? 12 hr., a discrepancy of 1.86 hr. is negligible. It must be remembered also that this discrep- ancy arose in Red-1, an experiment performed when our rapidly improving technique for instar- determination was in its infancy. Plots which we can now produce are so smooth that there is no (lifficulty whatever in making a very exact (le- termination graphically. For a run now being analysed the calculation time, using LD5,) and some other analysis, is already over 90 hr., and some 50 more will be needed. The same thing, could be done graphically with only nominal loss of ac- curacy in some 5 hr. work. .-\dmittedly the Standard Errors would be lost, but unless values in pairs are very similar, statistical confirmation of significance is hardly necessary. For example, T. castaneurn reared at 280C. and 65% R.H. is approximately 40 hr. faster than T. con fusumn. The Standard Errors of the respective transforma- tion points are certainly not greater than ? 1.5 to 2.0 hr. No elaborate analysis is needed to con- vince the experimenter that castqneloli is winning the race in snch a case. It might be added here that the points (E-1) were found exactly as in Stanley (1953b), using a preliminary curve for egg-hatching obtained from an egg-timer (Stanley 1939), and making subsequent compensation for egg-mortality. In practice, in future, it is intended to determine (F-I) entirely from the egg-timer data, discard-</page><page sequence="6">478 JOHN STANLEY AND H. M. SLATIS Ecology, Vol. 36, No. 3 ing the first-instar and egg curves from the auto- trephon. The first-instar are difficult to deal with, and less than 25 are available, whereas 500 or more are easily handled on one pass of the egg- timer, and timing is good to the nearest 0.25 hr. It will be seen from what follows that all the life histories are very similar. So much so that it has been a matter of some difficulty to find any means of pictorial presentation which will ade- quately display them. Certain possible methods are shown later, but the writers are open to sug- gestion as to better methods. The writers make no apology for these per- haps somewhat halting adventures in statistics. They are still very much feeling their way with the analysis of autotrephon data, and must use such methods as they can devise. They are open to suggestions as to some statistical method of dealing with a pair of life-histories en bloc. The piece-meal dissection of life-histories by a suc- cession of LD50's does provide interesting in- formation as to trends as time marches on, but it does not really answer the crucial question: "Are these two life-histories in essence the same, or do they differ, and if so, how, and to what ex- tent ?" Figure 2 provides at least a crude answer. Very large quantities of raw data are available to anyone who cares to investigate this problem. DISCUSSION Genetics The genetics of the black coloration in McGill Black Tribolium con fustin have been studied in the Department of Genetics at McGill University by H.M.S., who has also investigated a similar mutation in Tribolium castaneunt, to be described later. Crosses of McGill Red &amp; M\TcGill Black produce an intermediate form, slightly darker than the normal red, with a peculiar faint bronzy irri- descence. The name "bronze" is suggested for this form. The distinction between red and bronze is not as marked in T. con fusum as it is in T. castaneum. The F1 bronze beetles were crossed to yield 59 red, 134 bronze and 51 Black in the F2 generation. The value of Chi-square is 2.89 and P &gt; 0.2 (2 d.f.) so that this result does not differ sig- nificantly from that expected on the assumption that black is a simple semi-dominant mutation. Various crosses of F2 beetles were made, and the data are shown in Table II. The results agree with the hypothesis that black is a semi-dominant mutation. However, the observed number of black offspring in the cross: bronze x black, is much smaller than that expected., the chance of such a discrepancy being less than one in one thousand. A similar deficiency of blacks in the cross of bronze x bronze is not quite statistically significant. TABLE II. Progeny from various croses of Fs Tribolium confusum Number of various colors Cross No. of crosses Red Bronze Black Red x Red ........... 2 76 0 0 Red x Bronze ........ 2 31 19 0 Red x Black ......... 1 0 49 0 Bronze x Bronze ..... 1 5 11 0 Bronze x Black ....... 9 0 96 55 Black x Black........ 1 0 0 41 These discrepancies might be due to any one of three causes: (a) faulty classification of a red parent as bronze, (b) lower viability of blacks (though this is not shown by later rearings in the autotrephon) or (c) a chance variation. It will be noted that the counts of the F2 beetles also give a smaller number of blacks than expected, though the deficiency is not quite statistically sig- nificant, and in this case there cannot be any question of faulty classification. There is there- fore some reason to believe that, in the genetical experiments at least, black beetles were not as viable as red or bronze. It has been shown by certain of the above crosses that there is no link- age between black body-color and sex. A recessive dark body color, "ebony," repre- sented by ee, has been reported for this species by Park, Ginsberg and Horowitz (1945). They describe the color as "nearly black to the eye." Through the kindness of Dr. Thomas Park, at the University of Chicago, a culture of ebony T. confusum was made available to the writers, who compared it and crossed it with McGill Black, though no life histories were examined. When McGill Black is crossed with ebony, the progeny are all bronze, or at least no darker than one would find in a cross of black x red indi- viduals. In the F2 generation, the progeny were identified as 44 red, 102 bronze, 37 probably ebony and 44 as probably black. The occurrence of red beetles indicates that black and ebony are genes at independent loci. It is likely that bronze- ebony beetles are ebony in appearance, and that black-ebony beetles are black in appearance. On these assumptions, one would expect the colors to appear in the proportions: 3 red: 6 bronze: 3 ebony: 4 black. The observations differ from this theory with a value of Chi-square of 7.00, and 0.10 &gt; P &gt; 0.05 (3 d.f.). If we again suppose</page><page sequence="7">July, 1955 STUDIES FROM THE AUTOTREPHON, III 479 black beetles to have a lower viability than normal, the results are reasonably good. If per contra we assume that bronze-ebony beetles are indistinguishable from black, rather than from ebony, the expected ratios would be 3 red: 6 bronze: 1 ebony: 6 black, and the proba- bility that the observed values represent this set of ratios is much less than 0.001 (Chi-square = 59.9, with 3 d.f.). The moderately large number of ebony individuals observed strongly suggests the first interpretation. A further test of the independence of black and ebony is made by crossing the progeny of black x ebony back to the ebony stock. Several such crosses totalled 51 red, 45 bronze and 68 ebony. If the assumption is correct that bronze- ebony is indistinguishable from ebony, the ex- pected ratio would be 1:1:2. The criterion of linkage is the number of red beetles compared with the number of bronze. If these are about equal, black and ebony are probably not linked on the same chromosome. If there is some link- age, the number of red will be much less than the number of bronze. The occurrence of more red than bronze indicates that there can be little or no linkage between the two gene loci. It will be noted that in the two crosses de- scribed immediately above, the number of ebony beetles is below the number expected. A similar deficiency, but of a smaller order of magnitude, has been described by Park, Ginsberg and Horo- witz (1945). This deviation from expected values does not vitiate the conclusions drawn drawn from the experiments. Because bronze beetles are much closer in color to red than they are to black, and because the caudal cerci of bronze pupae are indistinguishable from those of red pupae, black should be de- scribed as essentially a recessive character. On this basis, McGill Black may be symbolised by bb, bronze by Bb and the normal reddish-brown color by BB. It might be objected that it would be better to call red "RR", but as there are other mutations possible, this could be done only once. It seems better to connect the symbols with the particular mutation. Apart from the above genetic differences, there are others which anyone handling the beetles will notice. The odor of the normal reddish-brown insects, produced by a volatile ethylquinone (Alexander and Barton 1943), is not really un- pleasant. It is difficult to describe, but to J.S. at least, it is reminiscent of dilute iodine vapor, but less "clean" smelling, and a little heavier and perhaps cloying. The odor of McGill Black is easier to describe, being definitely ammoniacal in flavour (though it may contain no ammonia), somewhat putrid, and quite unpleasant. If one opens a pair of cabinets containing mass cultures of the two strains, the difference in odor is im- mediately apparent. A cabinet in which "reds" have been housed without much ventilation is not too smelly, whereas one housing "blacks," and long kept closed, can become really nasty-smell- ing. The writers are aware that the appreciation of odors is highly subjective, and the above is the best they can do in the way of descriptions. No statistics are available, but it is the im- pression of J.S. that McGill Black beetles will be found more frequently in copula when examined in large numbers in petri dishes. Further, be- ginning in the third instar, and sometimes in the second, the larvae of the two mutations or strains are easily distinguishable. Those of McGill Red have tawny brown tergites, while those of McGill Black are a dusky dun color. The older punae are similar distinguishable, but the eggs appear to be identical in appearance. It is clear that the single gene alteration leading to McGill Black has had some quite profound effects upon internal biochemistry and even upon "temperament," if we may use an anthropomorphic term. It has also altered rate of development, rather curiously, only very slightly, as will be seen later. Under the conditions of these present ex- periments, McGill Black is very slightly slower in its development than McGill Red, but it is not impossible that some set of conditions may yet be found under which it will develop a little faster than McGill Red. The Environmental Indices for the two should be interesting, when we have enough data to determine them (Stanley 1946). It is suggested that inasmuch as McGill Black is almost identical in life history with the normal reddish-brown insects, it could be used as a sort of "tracer" in some experiments. When testing the egg-eating capacity of female "red" for ex- ample, the eggs found after an interval are a mix- ture of those left from the set put in at the start, with those laid since. If the original eggs are "black," and one presumes they are equally palata- ble as compared with "red" eggs, the residual eggs could be reared, and the two kinds separated on the basis of the colors of the young larvae.

The Standard Er- ror of the differences was calculated by the usual method, assuming no correlation between mem- bers of a pair. It will be noted that, with the exception of the pair (Red-1-Red-3), the differ- ences are not significant in the early stages, but tend to become more so as the life histories drift apart with the passage of time. An attempt has been made to show this in Figure 1, plotted from the data of Table IV, with the vertical scale exag- gerated by a factor of 10. Significant differences are shown as solid circles, non-significant by open circles. In every case in which a "black" is com- pared with a "red," the line of the plot of Figure 1 slopes generally upward, showing that McGill Black develops a little more slowly than McGill Red. These differences may appear to the eye to be quite marked in Figure 1, but in Figure 2, where the least similar pair (Combined Red and Combined Black) are contrasted, it is seen that the differences are actually almost minute, though they are nevertheless real. In Figure 2, the value for each transformation point of Combined Black is plotted as an ordinate against the homologous value for Combined Red. Had the two life-his- tories been identical, the plotted points would lie on a straight line of slope 45?. Assuming the fitted line (dotted) to go through the origin, the slope, calculated by the method of least squares is 450 34', showing McGill Black to be very slightly slower than McGill Red.

It has sub- sequently been found that Dyar's Rule cannot be applied to Tribolium confiusum (or castaneum) without some interesting modifications, which will form the subject of a later paper. Briefly, the head-width decreases during the life of a given instar, so that old specimens of say the nth instar become even more narrow-headed than young specimens of the (n-l)st instar, and can be con- fused with them. Our present technique is to measure every larva, and to plot the head-widths as frequency distributions for each sample. We thus obtain swarms of head-widths for each instar, and the instar of a given larva is at once deter- minable by noting to which swarm it belongs. Plotting time vertically, and size horizontally, the swarms are long ovals, sloping back to the left at the top, and separated by narrow sloping cor- ridors. The top "old" end of each overlaps (to the left = smaller head) the "young" bottom end of the previous swarm. This method was just coming into use when the quadruple run of Red and Black was done, and possibly accounts for the remarkable similarity of Black-1 and Black-2. We are also studying the whole question of the relative growth of Tribolium heads, using auto- trephon-timed samples. In an attempt to provide some measure of the over-all degree of dissimilarity between pairs of life histories, three approximate criteria are shown in Table V. In Column 4 there appears simply the number of significant differences between pairs,</page><page sequence="10">482 JOHN STANLEY AND H. M. SLATIS Ecology, Vol. 36, No. 3 the plus sign (+) indicating the inclusion of a "nearly significant difference." In Column 2 is shown the arithmetic total (neglecting signs) of the amounts of the significant differences, each weighted by multiplying by a factor. Inasmuch as one assesses the degree of significance of a difference by noting the ratio of the difference to its own Standard Error, this ratio is used as the weighting factor in each case. In Column 3 is shown the algebraic total of the weighted differ- ences. The criterion of Column 2 expresses the total degree of dissimilarity, while that of Column 3 gives some indication of retardation or accelera- tion of one member of a pair with respect to the other. It will be seen that there is general agree- ment between the 3 criteria in the matter of "order of merit" with respect to the degree of dis- similarity. Combined Red and Combined Black are least like each other, while Black-i and Black-2 are most similar. Among the "reds," Red-1 and Red-3 are most alike. This is probably coinci- dental, as one would expect Red-2 and Red-3, reared together, to be more alike. It is again apparent that the blacks are slower in develop- ment than the reds. TABLE V.

One may approach the problem of the differ- ences between life histories in another way, i.e. by examining the time spent, in hours, in each life-history stage. These were calculated by simple subtraction, the Standard Error of the time-span being the square root of the sum of the squares of the Standard Errors of the two ends of the interval. The results are shown for all 5 life- histories in Table VI. In the case of the time spent in the egg, the beginning of the interval is, as explained before, 0.00 + 0.5 hr. TABLE VI.

The values of Table VI do not yield as clear a picture of the life histories as do the transforma- tion points and, in view of the necessity for econo- my of space, we deal in detail only with the differ- ences between Combined Red and Combined Black. Table VII shows these data, whence it will again be seen that there is a general tendency for McGill Black to develop a little more slowly than McGill Red. However, the precision of the method is not sufficient to make manv of the differences significant. TABLE VII.

This difference</page><page sequence="11">July, 1955 STUDIES FROM THE AUTOTREPHON, III 48.3 may not be apparent, or may be reversed, possibly, under other conditions. This small difference be- tween two strains of one species is perhaps less interesting than is the fact that it could be dem- onstrated. It seems probable that there are many other such small differences between mutations, strains, races, etc., which might be brought out by similar experiments. Obviously, most interesting results could be obtained from studies of growth in synthetic media, with a view to assessing the importance of amino-acids etc. Combining this with the concept of the Environmental Index one might be able to make very clear assessments of the essentiality of such acids to growth and de- velopment. We have not as yet attempted to use the auto- trephen for anything but stored-products insects, but it could be used for any kind of culture for which the sample-vials do not need a frequent change of medium, provided that cooling will stop the growth. Comparison of Autotrephon Accuracy with that of a Clock Inasmuch as the autotrephon method is new, and has been subjected to some rather stringent crit- icism, it is though that it would be of interest to compare the measurement of time points with it to the measurement of time by a high-grade but moderate-priced clock, such as the ordinary per- son would use. Obviously a competition with a chronometer is futile. That is to say, we pro- pose to compare the accuracy of determination of an LD50 point with that of a single reading of time from a clock. With this in mind, the Western Clock Company Ltd., Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, was con- sulted, and they very kindly offered to perform the following experiment. Twenty-five standard "Big Ben Loud Alarm" clocks were taken from the production line at random, and passed to the adjustment section for the standard adjustment of going-rate, made prior to distribution to the trade. These clocks were then all wound up at the same time and placed together in one room. They were wound daily, but no further adjustments were made to either going-rate or time shown. They were allowed to run in this way for 20 days, or 480 hr. The times then indicated by the clocks were converted to elapsed time for each clock, and these are tab- ulated in Table VIII. It will be noted from Table VIII that the going- rates (as symbolised by the elapsed times) are fairly representative of the usual sort of random (Gaussian) distribution, complete with the usual TABLE VIII.

Including Clock No. 12, the mean measurement of 480 hr., is 479.97 hr. with a Standard Deviation of .539 hr., and a Standard Error of + 0.108 hr. Excluding Clock No. 12, we have 480.060 hr., Standard Devia- tion ? 0.362 hr., Standard Error ? 0.072 hr. Let us avoid any discrimination against the clocks, and exclude Clock No. 12. Now the Standard Deviaton of ? 0.362 hr. is a measure of the scattering about the mean of clocks of this sort (assuming all clocks are like the 24 we used). The Standard Error of ? 0.072 hr. is a measure of the accuracy with which, using 24 clocks, we could measure 480 hr. If we had used more clocks, the Standard Error would of course have decreased, but the Standard Deviation, be- ing a measure of the dispersion of the distribution of elapsed time (or of going-rates) would remain the same. If a single clock is taken, the measure of the likelihood that it will have a given going rate of 480 hours in 480 hours is the Standard Deviation (.+ 0.362 hr.) which we have deter-</page><page sequence="12">484 JOHN STANLEY AND H. M. SLATIS Ecology, Vol. 36, No. 3 mined. As we have only one clock, this will also be the Standard Error for this one clock. The Standard Error of an LD50 is a measure of the accuracy with which the autotrephon can measure a time interval (really the combination or system of insects growing in an autotrephon, and treated as we treat them). We have to compare then the value ? 0.362 with the Standard Errors of some LD50's. Table III shows Standard Er- rors of the order of + 1.00 to 2.00 hr., in 700 hr. For Combined Red, the point (5-6) is 410.98 ? 0.74 hr. This is an accuracy about half that of our hypothetical clock, so that to get the same accuracy with the autotrephon, remembering that the Combined Red value comes from 3 sub-runs, we would need 12 sub-runs with 25 insects in each vial. Inasmuch as these can be done in 3 runs using linked tracking in 4's, it will be seen that the autotrephon, while not as good as a "Big Ben" alarm clock, is not at all bad, as a time-keeper. Actually, it is vastly better than some of the early efforts of the clock industry, and probably quite as good as the average household clock with its works lubricated with a mixture of dust and kitchen vapors ! If samplng were to be at smaller intervals then every 10 hr., the autotrephon accuracy could be increased, but in view of the large effort involved in every 10-hour sampling, it is not intended to shorten the interval except in some special cases. It might be pointed out that one of the principal advantages of the autotrephon is that it allows the experimenter to escape from the "tyranny of the clock." Any program desired can be car- ried out with only occasional visits to load the controller and, if a personal note may be here interjected, J.S. still likes to look out at 2 A.M. on some of our famous Montreal blizzards, and think of the samples rolling out. SUMMARY With reference to Tribolium confusum Duval, living in whole wheat flour plus 3% of ground wheat germ, at 30? ? 0.05'C. and 75 + 1% (or less) relative humidity, the genetics and life his- tory of a black mutation (McGill Black) are com- pared with similar information for the normal reddish-brown strain (McGill Red). It is shown that McGill Black (bb) is a semi- dominant character, produced by a single gene not on the same chromosome as the single gene pro- ducing the mutation "ebony" of Park, Ginsberg and Horowitz (1945). There is also no sex-link- age. Intermediate forms are bronze in color (Bb). Various crosses with ebony forms are described. McGill Black is blacker than ebony, and can be distinguished from it by color. Larval instars and pupae can be distinguished from those of "red" insects, and it is suggested that McGill Black might be useful as a "tracer" in some studies, as apart from color, it seems almost identical with the normal reddish-brown form. The odor is ammoniacal, putrid and somewhat offensive, quite different to the rather "clean" smell of ordinary T. confusum. McGill Black develops a little more slowly than McGill Red at 30'C., but the differences are very slight, and can only be proven statistically. These differences could conceivably be reversed or elim- inated under the other conditions. A comparison is made between the accuracy of time-measurement with the autotrephon, and that of a high-grade but inexpensive alarm clock. The accuracy is about one-half that of the clock, but probably about as good as that of the ordinary worn clock. By accuracy of the autotrephon is meant the accuracy with which it will yield 50% transformation points from one life-history stage to the next. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are indebted to the National Re- search Council of Canada for financial support of the autotrephon program. Without this support the laboratory could not be operated. They are also indebted to Mr. J. H. Vernor, General A/tanager of the Western Clock Co. Ltd., Peterborough, Ontario, who authorized and super- vised the trial of the clocks, and to Miss Helen J. Martin and Miss Sally Wilson, Research As- sistants, who faithfully carried out the laborious examination of the samples. They are particularly appreciative of the kind- ness of Dr. Thomas Park, of the University of Chicago, who provided the subculture of the mu- tation "ebony." Mr. J. W. Pollock, Instrument Maker to the Department of Zoology at McGill University, who made most of the autotrephon, continued to func- tion as the man who answered the anguished calls for help.
