Scott Fitzgerald Introduction by Julian Evans; foreword by Paul Theroux London : Hesperus Press , 2011. 92 pages KIRK CURNUTT According to legend, the newly minted Mrs. F. Scott Fitzgerald awoke one morning somewhere around 18 July 1920 with an insatiable longing for peaches and biscuits. Her hunger was as much nostalgia as appetite. Three months into her marriage and still days from turning twenty, the former Zelda Sayre remained very much a child of the South, and her relocation that spring from the languor of her upbringing to the cosmopolitan bustle of the East had proved an adjustment, to say the least. Ever attentive to his wife's whims, her husband suggested they drive to Zelda's hometown of Montgomery, Al- abama, for breakfast. Fitzgerald's motives were not entirely domestic. With his name in the daily columns for This Side of Paradise , published a mere week before his April wedding, and his first collection of short stories, Flappers and Philosophers , scheduled to make it into bookstores that September, the twenty- three-year-old enfant terrible of the Younger Generation was reveling in his public role as a celebrity. With this newfound fame came more professional opportunities to write - if not quite Literature on the order of the major names he was prone to drop at least fun, personality-driven nonfiction pieces that would pay cash on the barrelhead. The story of something as impulsive, indulgent, and downright daring for the day as speeding across a half-dozen states for local-color cuisine was just the sort of stunt that made for irresistible ink. At the very least, the jaunt would be an exciting adventure and put some distance between the couple and the modern condition they feared second only to growing old: boredom. The resulting trip was a grueling misadventure, which was great for the prospective essay but hard on the nerves. As Nancy Milford tells the story in Zelda (1970), "[T]here were blowouts, lost wheels, and broken axles. Zelda, who was to navigate, had no idea how to read a map. Her white knickerbocker suit (which had been made to match Scott's) was considered shocking enough ©2012 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Society/Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 154 The F.

The automobile that transported them, a 1918 Marmon touring car, was in such tattered shape it had to be abandoned in Montgomery; some- where around 4 August the Fitzgeralds caught a train back to their rented home in Westport, Connecticut. "The joys of motoring are more or less fictional," Zelda assured their friend Ludlow Fowler upon their return (qtd. in Milford 74). The F.

Thanks to a little distraction called The Beautiful and Damned - not to mention stories such as "His Russet Witch" (1920) and the novella-length "The Popular Girl" (1922) - work on the piece did not even begin until early 1922. Originally, Fitzgerald intended it as an American complement to a series of European travel sketches he hoped to produce in the tradition of Theodore Dreiser's A Traveller at Forty (1913) and Joseph Hergesheimer's recent St. Christobal de Habana (1920), but that project never saw fruition beyond "How to Live on Practically Nothing a Year" (1924) and the unpublished-in-his-lifetime "The High Cost of Macaroni" (written in 1925). By the time he sent a draft to his agent, Harold Ober, the Westport- to-Montgomery article had ballooned to 25,000 words. The ideal market, naturally, was the Saturday Evening Post , although the length made it a dicey sale - at best the magazine would have to break it into installments and publish it in consecutive months, as its editors had recently done to accommodate the two-part "The Popular Girl." Fitzgerald felt his hard work merited at least $2,500, although he would accept a bargain-basement fee of $2,000. The Post offered $0.00. Flustered, Fitzgerald cut the piece to 17,000 words, supposedly remov- ing a digression on his father's experiences as a child during the Civil War, but none of the potential markets he suggested to Ober ( McClure's , Scribneťs Magazine , Hearst's International ) panned out. Not until early 1924 would the essay run in the February, March, and April issues of Motor , a stylish niche magazine that mixed insider analyses of automotive design and development with general-interest articles celebrating cars as fashion accoutrements. The check totaled a paltry $300. From there, the essay was quickly forgotten. Fitzgerald himself mentioned it to Maxwell Perkins as a possible entry in a proposed nonfiction collection in 1934, but otherwise he appears to have thought little about it. His own words suggest how far it fell in his estima- tion. In 1922 he had pitched the piece to Ober as "humorous throughout" (Bruccoli 44); a dozen years later, to Perkins, it was downgraded to "suppos- edly humorous" (Life in Letters 261). No collection of Fitzgerald's nonfiction was issued in his lifetime, and because it was so long, the travelogue was excluded from posthumous compendiums such as The Crack-Up (1945), Af- ternoon of an Author (1958), and James L. West Ill's definitive My Lost City: Personal Essays , 1920-1940 (2005). As a result, "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" fell into veritable obscurity for more than fifty years. Until now, those of us who have ever read this rarity likely did so in the limited edition facsimile published by Matthew J. Bruccoli's Bruccoli Clark imprint in 1976. Issues of Motor occasionally pop up on eBay and 156 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re vie w, Vol. 10, 2012</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW other memorabilia trading sites, but in two-and-a-half decades of intermittent looking I have yet to come across issues from early 1924. By contrast, when I first began building my Fitzgerald library in the mid-1980s, Bruccoli's folio- sized edition was easy enough to come by, though the price was prohibitive - for many years used copies ran right around $100, second only to the 1974 scrapbook, The Romantic Egoists , which before the University of South Carolina Press published a softcover edition in 2003, was hard to find for less than $150. (Thanks to the deflation the Internet has brought to the used-book market, the Bruccoli Cruise can now be found for as low as $12, although $40 is the average.) Given the essay's reputation as a curiosity rather than a classic, few Fitzgerald scholars felt the expense merited the reward, and, as a result, critical interest in the article also suffered. Roderick S. Speer called attention to it in a 1974 Modern Fiction Studies analysis by linking it thematically to The Great Gatsby ; Janet Lewis offered a biographical reading in the 1978 Fitzgerald-Hemingway Annual that to this date remains its most extensive study. (Lewis's piece is available online at http://fitzgerald.narod.ru/critics- eng/lewis-rollingjunk.html.) Otherwise, the critical indifference has been persistent. For this reason alone, the London-based Hesperus Press has done us a major favor by reprinting "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" in an inexpensive, even handy paperback edition that, for the first time, makes it widely available. Since this compact 92-page book became available in late 201 1, it has been the subject of several book and history blogs that have helped raise recognition of Fitzgerald's nonfiction among Internet audiences. For a specialist or even an ardent fan, it is a good exercise to get online once in a while and check out what everyday commentators at Literary Lindsay or Kaggy's Bookish Ramblings are saying. Such blogs are at once an index of specific perceptions of Fitzgerald and a solid gauge of ongoing interest in him. If nothing else, their positive estimations of this forgotten essay demonstrate how well Hesperus fulfills its mission statement, which is to make accessible works "unjustly neglected or simply little known." Any effort to raise the profile of Henry Fielding's Jonathan Wild the Great (1743) or Katherine Mansfield's Prelude (1918) as opposed to their more famous works is admirable - though it should be noted that these and other entries in the Hesperus catalogue, such as Henry James's In the Cage (1898), have always been commercially available from major publishers, and thus nowhere near as obscure as "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk." Hesperus's first foray into Fitzgerald, for example, was a 2005 edition of "The Popular Girl," with a foreword by Helen Dunmore; this story has long been available in Bruccoli's Bits of Paradise: 21 Uncollected Stories by F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (1973) and also his Before Gatsby: The First Twenty-Six Stories (2001), so The F.

The real appeal of a Hesperus book - aside from the French flaps giving it a modicum of elegance - is its size. At 5"x8" (or, more accurately, 4.90"x7.60"), these are softcovers designed for pocket portability, best enjoyed when a book can enliven a dead moment of limbo: in line at the DMV, during elevator rides, stuck at an interminable train-crossing. Most Hesperus volumes are also short enough to be read in one sitting. I downed the entirety of "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" over the course of a chicken-salad sandwich from Mama's Sack Lunch while sitting on a bench facing the Court Square Fountain where some locals still claim, despite scant evidence, a raucous Fitzgerald pub crawl through Montgomery ended with revelers tossing their lingerie onto the life-sized statue of Hebe, the goddess of youth and spring. By the end of the essay, as the Fitzgeralds roll onto Dexter Avenue only yards from where I perched, Zelda "crying because things [in her hometown] were the same and yet were not the same" (85), I wished I had a second Hesperus book on me. I still had fifteen minutes before I was expected in class. Now that it is conveniently and inexpensively available, what do we make of "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk"? Is it simply an entertaining bit of ephemera, or does it broaden our understanding of the Fitzgeralds, or of their era? The foreword and introduction to this Hesperus edition certainly make the argument for the latter. As Paul Theroux's illuminating remarks note, "The piece is one of the first in that most American of genres - a tradition in American travelling and travel writing - the long road trip by car" (8). As a progenitor of Henry Miller's The Air Conditioned Nightmare (1945), John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley (1962), and William Least-Heat Moon's Blue Highways (1982), "Rolling Junk" contains many of the narrative devices and motifs that will become de rigueur in these later genre exemplars. (One earlier text Theroux does not mention: Sinclair Lewis's Free Air , which appeared a good half-decade before "Rolling Junk" in 1919). Foremost among these conventions, as Theroux points out, is the personification of the vehicle itself: "In each of these trips, the car is a character, more meaningful and lovable to the writer, perhaps, than to the reader, to whom this anthropomorphism cannot but feel cute" (8-9). Also present in the essay is the structural conceit of using maps, directions, routes, and itineraries as metaphors for the illusoriness of the very notion of arrival, of an endpoint as a significant milestone. In most of these books, final destinations almost always invite disappointment, inasmuch as they prove pit stops instead of culminations of the authors' quest for meaning. "The piece deploys what became standard effects in road trip literature," Theroux argues, "the shifting gears of high hopes, disappointing 158 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re vie w, Vol. 10, 2012</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW reverses, sudden landscapes, brief encounters, breakdowns, and changes in tone" (9). Yet despite the many ways that "Rolling Junk" prefigures the American road-trip genre, it departs from what will become this literary tradition in one significant way noted by Theroux: "Fitzgerald saw himself and his own exploits as central to his trip. He was not travelling to listen but rather in the thrust of exhibitionism. This is the chief weakness of The Cruise'" (10). It is a fair and accurate point. A central appeal of Charley and Blue Highways is their narrators' empathy, the individual driver's willingness to let the folks he encounters speak their minds, tell their stories, and, most importantly, share. In this way, the journeys become gestures of connection, efforts to establish humanist bonds among strangers and preserve that Whitmanesque spirit of a capacious, generous American spirit. In "Rolling Junk," by contrast, the locals that the Fitzgeralds encounter are invariably foils, whether unsavory mechanics, stick-in-the-mud Mrs. Grundies, or plain scary highway robbers. For the modern reader, the most uncomfortable passages will involve their dealings with African Americans. Nowhere in the essay is there any reflection on the history of American race relations; certainly there is no Pisgah moment such as Steinbeck arrives at when he carries a black hitchhiker to Montgomery and gains insight into the struggle for equality and dignity among the Civil Rights campaigns of the early 1960s. Here is Fitzgerald on the "miasmatic atmosphere" of a black grocery where he stops for cigarettes: I could not say clearly even now what was going on in that store - a moonshine orgy, a pay-day gambling bout, something more sinister than these or perhaps not sinister at all. Nor could I determine whether the man who waited on me was black or white. But this I know - that the room was simply jammed with negroes and that the moral and physical aura which they cast off was to me oppressive and obscene. I was glad to find my way outside again [....] (59-60) Of course, Fitzgerald partisans will not be surprised by such passages; we have long had to come to grips with the fact that our man's prejudices reflect rather than transcend the prejudices of his day. Still, as Theroux is correct to say, the exhibitionistic instinct the Fitzgeralds reveled in during this heady period of young fame marks a major difference in the emotional tenor of their road trip. Whereas other writers set out seeking other people's stories, the Fitzgeralds are interested only in their own. As a result, the scenery never steps to the forefront, and the byways of the seaboard and Deep South are simply backdrops for their theatrical, performing personas. The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re view, Vol. 10, 2012 159</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW If Theroux's foreword focuses on genre, Julian Evans's twelve-page in- troduction places the essay in the broader context of Fitzgerald's life, recurring themes, and developing style. Evans produced an excellent forty-minute BBC radio commentary for the Fitzgerald centenary in 1996 (a MP3 of which is available for download at www.julianevans.com), and as a travel writer and biographer himself he is eminently qualified to assess the import of the piece. As a "purposely lightweight account" (15), "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" may seem frivolous, he argues, but beneath its surface whimsy is a more unsettling commentary on American restlessness that links the piece to The Great Gatsby. The major symbol of this desire for motion, of course, is the Rolling Junk itself. As "one of the earliest novelists to understand the significance of the new world of the automobile [. . .] and how it would change life, sexual relations and literature" (19), Fitzgerald recognized the power of technology to alter experiential norms of space, speed, time, and distance. The transformations the automobile brought to these registers is evident in Scott and Zelda's inability to control the course of their adventure, with "every particular of auto-related calamity" befalling them, from "meaningless signs, importunate darkness, grave-deep ruts, wrong-way streets, blow-outs" to "highwaymen, thunderstorms and sandstorms" (19). As Evans recognizes, when launched into future shock, Fitzgerald's tendency was to cling harder to the past. Accordingly, as in Gatsby , "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" is a quest to recover a golden age: "[T]he Fitzgeralds' destination is not just an ante-bellum but, as he makes clear, a prelapsarian America, and their journey is not just into the south but into the past: an impossible return, as Gatsby's is" (23). The essay and novel even share certain details. Wheels are amputated (as in Gatsby' s Chapter III party scene); bystanders rush in front of cars, not understanding the physics of motion and force; motorists accelerate when a dangerous moment calls for braking. As Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway remind us, a culture that puts the pedal to the metal becomes a land of bad drivers, plowing ahead with reckless disregard for caution signals. Evans's most satisfying comments, however, have less to do with theme than style. I think, quite honestly, most readers will find portions of "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" as clunky as the used 1918 Marmon itself. In passages the essay suffers from the same tendency to overwrite that mars The Beautiful and Damned. Its opening line reads, "The sun, which had been tapping for an hour at my closed lids, pounded suddenly on my eyes with broad, hot hammers" (29). And setting off on the adventure: "To be young, to be bound for the far hills, to be going where happiness hung from a tree, a ring to be tilted for, a bright garland to be won - It was still a realizable thing, we thought, still a harbor from the dullness and the tears and disillusion of all the stationary 160 The F. Scott Fitzgerald Re vie w, Vol. 10, 2012</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW world" (33). Another passage describes Zelda suffering a crying jag: "It was for her faithlessness that she wept and for the faithlessness of time" (85). Such sentences leap out to remind us that Fitzgerald was all of twenty-five when he wrote this piece. Yet Evans is exactly right to ask us to overlook such infelicitous mo- ments to appreciate "the space of poetry" in which "a lyrical sensibility can work" and "transcend the irony" of the trip's "willed and fulfilled failure": "In 'The Cruise of the Rolling Junk' there are already descriptive passages, between the wisecracking and the frippery, that are both gorgeous and mature: not landscapes or cityscapes or crowds and certainly not individuals, but vistas, perspectives, and, above all, lighting. It has been said Fitzgerald wrote for the movies without knowing it, and it's impossible not to notice here the way everything is lit, as it will be in Gatsby " (21). My own favorite passages concern "faces" in a New York crowd "splashing and eddying and swirling like the white tips of countless waves" (33); the "freckled orchards" of the Brandywine Valley (43); Southern trees "gestur[ing] with the faintly tired hauteur of a fine lady's hand" (56); and, not surprisingly, Alabama, where "white boulevards [run] between green fields towards an enchanted sunset land" (87). These are all fine reminders of how just how prettily Fitzgerald wrote, and how we should resist the contemporary temptation to think of pretty writing as gooey and sickly instead of the quality that it truly incarnates: charm. In the end, however, the main impression that "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" conveys is not picturesque American prettiness. It is, rather, the emerging junk culture, the utter disposability of the nation's commercial products. The roadsides the Fitzgeralds cruise along are flush with detritus, from discarded milk jugs and gas cans to unappetizing egg sandwiches to Old King Brady detective magazines read once and crumpled. There is even the matter of the desiccated tongue tip Scott and Zelda discover on the carpet of their Richmond hotel. The major symbol of American planned obsolescence, however, is the Rolling Junk itself, which is always one rivet away from collapsing into a pile of scrap metal. Anyone who has ever been dependent on a clunker for transportation understands the art of jerrybuilding, of doing triage in the name of keeping the machine running. I once owned a 1979 Grand Prix with an asthmatic carburetor. Too broke to replace it, I learned the fine art of jamming a pen against the choke plate so the engine could get enough air to start. Having to pop the hood every time I hit the ignition was hardly stylish driving, but the maneuver worked until one day the pen disappeared straight down the gullet of the carburetor, and the mechanics did not stop laughing until I was $500 poorer. The Fitzgeralds resort to similar tricks to keep the Rolling Junk rolling from Connecticut to Alabama, relying on mechanics to The F.

If duct tape had existed in 1920, they probably would have used it, too. The high point of the comedy comes in the last stretch as the Marmon gasps from Tuskegee to Montgomery: We left something behind us in Tuskegee. We did not know it at the time and it was better that we should not know. Into a tranquil street of the reposeful city we had dropped an intrinsic part of the Rolling Junk - from Tuskegee onward we were without the services of a battery. It had jumped with a neat and imperceptible movement from the car. Had we stopped now and shut off the motor, if only for a minute, no power we could have wielded would have started us again. (84) The question "The Cruise of the Rolling Junk" only implicitly poses - but one that Fitzgerald's fascination with wastage begs us to ask - is to what degree the jerrybuilding of America affects the durability of bonds. By that intentionally metaphorical term I mean not only nuts and bolts but any kind of ties that bind, whether structural, psychological, or moral. When things are built to fall apart and we live in a perpetual stage of rigging, our ideas of permanence become less cohering and cohesive. Nowadays we associate the term "junk bond" with disgraced Reagan-era Wall Street whiz Michael Milken, who went to federal prison in 1990 for manipulating concrete values into tenuous abstractions, just as Gatsby's conspirators, Slagle and Parke, appear to in 1922. But I think Fitzgerald would have viewed the concept of junk bonds more broadly, as the weakened fasteners, latches, and agents - the glue - straining to hold belief systems together in sweeping eras of change. As romantic a notion of history as the concluding image of boats against the current in Gatsby is, I wonder if in the end the image of the Rolling Junk disgorging its own parts without knowing it, of nearly rattling itself into a heap and still making its destination, captures more accurately our felt experience of how we hurl through time. Never mind running faster or stretching our arms farther. As this now-recovered 1924 essay suggests, we more likely strap on our seatbelts, plant our feet to the floorboards, and hope - just hope - the wheels do not come off.
