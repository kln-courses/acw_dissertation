The fine breadth and generosity of evangelic sympathy, the just spiritual sagacity perhaps not less, which characterize this somewhat "liberal" writer are well displayed in a striking remark of his about Spurgeon: "The church does not yet know what a great saint and doctor she possessed in Mr. Spurgeon." With all our admiration and applause of this volume and this writer, we make, as in duty bound, our contribution toward keeping high the standard of public requirement from those who offer us books, by pointing out a few negligences observed in these generally fair and scholarlike pages. "Endaemonism" (p. 34) is, we suppose, an error of the press for "eudaemonism." " It meets the whole wants of the guilty" (p. 175) must, we judge, be a slip of the author's own. "That Balzac was free from follies it would be ridiculous to deny " (p. 294), is followed on the very next page by a solecism of the same sort, " How often, even in his least ungenial writing, when he seems aban- doned to the spirit of cynicism, does his faith flash up and drive it out of sight!" Mr. Nicoll's choice of title for one of his papers, "Lis- tening unto Death," seems to imply a wrong exegesis. "Listen- ing" is Mr. Nicoll's substitution for "obedient" in the expression, referring to Christ, "obedient unto death," where evidently the apostle's meaning is, not, as Mr. Nicoll makes it, until death, but up to the extreme of dying, nay, of dying on the cross. But exceptions and abatements like those which we have thus noted count as nothing against the value and merit of this seasonable and wholesome book. WILLIAM CLEAVER WILKINSON. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. SOCIAL AND ETHICAL INTERPRETATIONS IN MENTAL DEVELOPMENT: A Study in Social Psychology. By PROFESSOR JAMES MARK BALDWIN, of Princeton University. New York: The Mac- millan Co., I897. Pp. xiv+574. $2.60. PROFESSOR BALDWIN'S latest volume is typical of the current reaction against the artificial teachings of the older, individualistic psychology. The demands of Steinthal, Lazarus, and Lewes for a social psychol- ogy-for a study of the forest as well as of the single tree-has not been unheeded. The psychologists and philosophers, notably James, Royce, and Dewey, are insisting upon the fact that the content of con- 712</page><page sequence="2">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE sciousness-whatever its abstract forms may be-is chiefly social, while the sociologists, with Tarde at their head, are affirming the same thing from a somewhat different point of view. Baldwin approaches the problems of social philosophy, ethics, and religion from the stand- point of genetic psychology. He attempts to interpret the phenomena in question with a conception which he describes as the "dialectic of personal growth." He asserts that an analysis of the process by which human personality is gradually developed during infancy, childhood, and youth will give deeper insight into the nature of social organiza- tion. Baldwin like Tarde makes much of 'imitation as the process by which the developing individual appropriates elements of personality from others, until the maturer product is a bewildering complex of self and other selves. Professor William James, in his chapter on "The Consciousness of Self," has pointed out this wide extension of the sense of self, but Baldwin offers an even more subtle and detailed analysis. In spite of a style that is almost always difficult and at times actually obscure, the author has strikingly set forth the fact that society is a vast plexus of interweaving personalities. Although individual growth is described in terms of a process far too simple, precise, even artificial, yet the reader realizes vividly that, by virtue of our common social life, "we are members one of another" in no merely sentimental, figura- tive sense, but as an actual psychological fact. Professor Baldwin further describes the gradual growth in the child's consciousness of a sense of a social self-a general personality or "socius" common to the group in which he lives. Out of this notion of the social self an ideal self is little by little built up, and with it comes the feeling. of obligation to attain this ideal-i. e., the ethical life begins. But this is not all. Certain emotions characterize the attitude toward this ideal personality, a feeling of dependence and a feeling of mystery. These two feelings combine to form the religi- ous sentiment,,which is, therefore, itself a product of growing personality. The feeling of dependence is described as passing through three stages: (1) instinctive or spontaneous, (2) intellectual, (3) ethical. The early tendency of the child is to put unquestioning faith in other per- sonalities, e. g., to make divinities of parents. Later the child, perplexed by the problems of nature, social life, and conduct, looks up to others as all-wise and able to solve his difficulties. Finally, with maturity comes the sense of helplessness in the presence of the ideal and its demands, the sense of sin, remorse, guilt, etc. The sense of mystery also passes through corresponding epochs, from vague apprehension 7 I 3</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY in the face of surprises in the physical world to a feeling of awe and wonder in the presence of an ideal, divine personality. Professor Baldwin's treatment may be regarded as supplementary to the work of the anthropologists and the students of religions. It affords another point of view and suggests many confirmations of generalizations reached from the side of religious philosophy and objective description. The book may well be read in connection with the works of Tylor, Spencer, Miiller, Renan, Caird, and Guyau. In summing up his chapter on "Religious Sentiment," Professor Baldwin offers a revision of Matthew Arnold's definition: " Religion is morality touched with emotion ;" for which he would substitute: "Reli- gion is emotion kindled by faith, emotion being reverence for a person and faith being dependence upon him." The task which the author undertakes is to show the growth of this ideal person in consciousness and the development of the sense of dependence. It is a detailed, if not always perfectly clear, examination of anthropomorphism. The cumu- lative effect of the argument is striking. It seems at first to threaten theological revolution, but ultimately resolves itself into a reinterpreta- tion of familiar phenomena by means of searching psychological analysis. It is to be noted that in Baldwin's view religion like morality develops directly out of social life and consciousness of social relation- ships. Stress is laid upon the essentially social character of both the ethical and the religious life. The individual of the old individualistic philosophy is shown to be a mere logical abstraction, a phantom with- out concrete existence. Yet individuality is not neglected. As imitation represents the uniforming force in society, so invention stands for personal contribution and initiative. Social progress is brought about by the widespread imitation of the new ideas of inventive individuals. In the ethical life most of the alleged antitheses between individual and social welfare have no real existence. By the very interweaving of personalities the ego cannot be sharply set off from the alter. The father does not think himself definitely apart from his family. Social regulations are accepted by the vast majority of men because they them- selves embody these common standards as a part of their own person- alities. In the case of exceptional individuals, or the exceptional judgments of ordinary individuals, oppositions do appear and are themselves the source of progress. Professor Baldwin offers, therefore, a complete social philosophy. By means of the concepts, imitation, invention, opposition, he seeks to correlate all the phenomena of social life. It may be said that he 714</page><page sequence="4">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE has succeeded in restating the problem in clearer terms. He has changed the labels on the mysteries. In doing this he has made an important contribution. It is to be regretted that his book is hard to read and that the treatment is not more thoroughly organic. But, in spite of these defects, it must be frankly admitted that the author has outlined a plan of campaign in the field of social psychology which should win him the gratitude of philosophers and psychologists gen- erally. GEORGE E. VINCENT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. THE EPIC OF PAUL. By WILLIAM CLEAVER WILKINSON. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co., I897. Pp. 722. $2. To HIS Epic of Saul, which was received with warm commendation a few years ago, Dr. Wilkinson has now added The Epic of Paul. The first presented the opening scenes in the Christian life of the apostle to the Gentiles; the second presents the closing scenes, beginning with his captivity at Jerusalem and ending with his martyrdom at Rome. It would be too slight praise to say that the reader will find in the second volume all the characteristic excellences of the first, for he will find more. The first was admirable, but in the second the author makes a flight so bold and so well sustained that he must be accorded a higher place among the poets of the English language than that which he had before reached, eminent as it was. The Epic of Paul is a Christian poem. From first to last the reader of it breathes an atmosphere of devotion. But it does not plead for a lenient judgment from the critic on that account. It does not make its piety a cloak for deformity or inanity. It is a work of art, and will be admired by many to whom its religious character will be unwelcome. First of all, it presents to us a plot of generous proportions. In this respect it stands almost alone among recent poems. Even Ten- nyson did not achieve any large construction. He attempted some- thing like an epic in "The Idyls of the King," yet produced only a series of disconnected stories of chivalry, each charming in itself, but sustaining no organic relation to its fellows. Dr. Wilkinson, following in the main the last seven chapters of the Acts, has built a structure imposing for its extent, of harmonious proportions, and fitly framed together. He has not sought to make a poetic version of these chap- ters; he has selected his materials from them with skill, excluding 715</page></plain_text>
