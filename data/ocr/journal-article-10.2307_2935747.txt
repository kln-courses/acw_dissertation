Hebrew Words in the Latin Glossary Codex Sangallensis 912, by Mr. Cyrus Adler, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. In the introduction to his paper on Latin Glossaries, with especial reference to the Codex Sangallensis 912 (Transactions of the American Philological Associa- tion, Vol. XV., pp. 124-228), Dr. Minton Warren remarks (p. 126): "Most of the words are Latin; not a few Hebrew words and proper names, however, occur, due to ecclesiastical sources." This remark led me to a study of these Hebrew words and names. So small a list can, of course, furnish but little basis for the pronunciation of Hebrew, or its transcription in Latin; yet such a collec- tion may be valuable, and is certainly interesting for etymology and pronunciation of both Hebrew and Latin.1 1 Compare, for instance, Carl Siegfried, Die Aussprache des .Hebraischen bei Hie- ronymus (Zeitschrift fir die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, I884, pp. 34-83).</page><page sequence="5">Proceedings for :uly, 1886. A. I. Abba: pater. USt, Aramean form. 107. Adonai: dominus signifi- cans. 'I'3l. 132. Aelam: porticum. Hebrew D7,? written also defectively Dbl: a porch, especially the temple (cf. I Kings 6:3, 7:6; Joel 2:17; II Chronicles I5: 8, ;11?' DlK). Jerome transcribes this word in the same way (cf Siegfried, p. 36).. 134. Aeden: dilitias. This is the later use of pl', and is, of course, secondary; edinu, in Babylonian, means simply 'field.' 226 and 227. Alma: virgo sancta, Hebreum est; aalma: virgo. The note on these words is as follows: "Neubauer says aalma is a mere repetition of the previous Hebrew word. The double a he thinks is introduced on account of the guttural sound of the a' (Ellis)." It seems much more likely, however, that the glosses are transposed; that aarlma is for 'niO,'l, with the article, and should be ex- plained by virgo sancta; while alma is for 7"1t?', and means simply virgo. The transliteration of the article preceding an initial guttural by aa is not uncommon. Thus Jerome renders D'nI7 by aadam, :3Tn1l by aagab (cf. Siegfried, p. 36). B. 22. Babil: confusio. This, of course, follows the punning etymology in Genesis I : 9, from 7:/. . Bab-ili means 'gate of God.' We have it written in the non-Shemitic Babylonian texts, ka dingira. 47. Bartholomeus: filius scs pendentes aquas. Note: "Bartholomaeus filius suspendentis aquas. Cf. Ball. MS., Bartholomaeus filius suspendentis aquas vel filius suspendentis me. Syrum est non Hebreum." This is quite correct; the name is Syriac, and not Hebrew. The name is not found in the Old Testament, and has usually been explained by 'son of Tholmai.' The name Talmai occurs in Numbers 13:22. But telim (DlV'%) also occurs in Samaritan and in Aramean. The passage in Genesis 49: 5,' D'rl 'LV71pW, I'Simeon and Levi are brothers,' is rendered by the Targums ft'?1% t'nt. As Simeon and Levi were both sons of Leah, most trans- lators render 'own brothers,' 'leibliche Briider.' Levy, in his dictionary of the Targumin, renders 'kiihn, muthig,' and derives it from Gr. TroXAupJs, TroXf/IELs. Assyriologists, as a rule, acquiesced in the former translation (cf. Delitzsch in Smith's Chaldaische Genesis, p. 272; Haupt, Sumerische Familiengesetze, p. 24, note; Akkadische Sprache, XXXIV.). Recently, however, a pagsage has been pointed out to me which may throw some doubt on this translation. In the barrel-inscription of Assurbanipal, found at Aboo Habbah (VR 62: II), Samas- sum-ukin, his brother, who was governor of Babylon, and who is generally called ahu nakru, usually translated ' the hostile or rebellious brother,' is there called ahu talimu. So that it is not impossible that talimu is a variant of nakru, and may perhaps mean 'step-brother' or &lt; foster-brother.' At all eveuts, a good deal, if not all, the material for an understanding of this name is now in. The curious meaning, filius suspendentis aquas, is false, and is gained by dividing it up into 1' bn 'n. 57. Belzebub: vir muscorum. 31It bJ3. 66. Belfecor: simula- crum Priapi. Note: Beelphegor simulacrum = ? '13 3';? C. 8. Cannon: regula. Assyr. qan4, ' reed.' 588. Corsam: divinans "Bod. cossam = divinans Amplon. 288, I65, cossam. Loewe, Prod. 342, pro- poses cossens = consens: divinas, but the word is Hebrew. Cf. Cosam, which DeVit Onomasticon derives from Hebrew Kasnm, h. e. divinavit ut divinantem significet." Demner -DDp; lot-D D.. It has occurred to me that corsam might be a good Syriac form. In Semetic, double D or 3 is sometimes resolved to rs or rn; for instance, K'D'1D for D:), 'throne,' and arnabu for annabu, ' hare.' v</page><page sequence="6">vi American Philological Association. D. II. Dabir: oraculum. This is, of course, 1''T, one of the most sacred parts of the temple. Jerome gives the same transcription. E. 14. Effeta: adaperire. Cf Loewe, G. N. I5I, "efficia: adaperire (effeta glossae 'asbestos ' quod non dubito quin verum sit, cum in interpretamento latere videatur pariendi vocabulum), but Hildebrand E 31 n. had already recognized in effeta the Hebrew epheta, which Du Cange explains by adaperire." I would add that this supposed Hebrew word must, of course, be referred to Mark 7: 34. "And looking up to heaven he sighed, and saith unto him, iq)qpa8d; that is, be opened." Jerome gives ephphtzha, and refers to this passage. Kautzsch (Gram- matik des Biblisch-Aramaischen. Leipzig, 1884, p. IO) explains this as an Ethpe'el form, i. e. for tnn3J?t. IO9. Ephot: '131. See Glossary, for defini- tion. F. 65. Farisei: divisi. from Y'1, 'to separate.' G. 2. Gabrihel: fortitudo dei. Jerome does not insert the h. H. o1. Hato: mendax. Note: "Hebrew hato, 'a sinner,' suggested through Ellis by Neubauer." I consider this doubtful. 6I. Hebrei: transgressores. 1:,V. 96. Hierosolisma: visis pacis (cf IOI). This etymology presupposes the derivation of the first part of Ey1I'' from the stem nIl. The name Jeru- salem occurs in Assyrian as Ur-sa-li-im-mu, and the ur may be the Akkadian word for 'city,' also found in Ur Kasdim. I. 8. Iabin: intellectus. 1'3'. 13. Iacobus: subplantator. 31i '. L. loo. Libani: potentes seculi et fortes. I consider the note on this word very doubtful. M. 47. Maranathema: in adventum domini (cf. Kautzsch, I2) Aramean. 58.

This gloss furnishes a very good etymology for the name Zion. It evidently is the word II'., found in plural in Jer. 31 :2I, meaning 'mark.' Jerome transcribes the form in Jeremiah, Sionim; and it is, accord- ingly, not impossible that this word and the name Zion are identical. We may</page><page sequence="7">Proceedings for 7uly, 1886. infer, therefore, either that P'$ is an incorrect vocalization, or else that the dif- ference in the vowel is to be explained as the result of dialectical influence. 235.

S. Scarborough, of Wilberforce University, Wilber- force, 0. After briefly portraying some of the features of the old Attic Comedy, and of the earlier works of Aristophanes, the speaker presented several of the theories, current among scholars, in explanation of the object of the Birds (K. O. Miller, Schlegel, K6chly, Silvern, Clark, Kennedy, Green, Felton, Symonds, Mahaffy). The theory of Siivern was defended with certain modifications suggested, - as to location of kind, and identification of the dramatis personae. The character of Alcibiades, and the state of affairs at the time of the Sicilian expedition were dis- cussed. The speaker maintained that the poet desired to reprove the people of Athens for their inordinate ambition, to condemn their litigious spirit and their schemes of universal empire. The purpose of this play is as specific as that of any other work of Aristophanes, though less clearly and fully set forth. The conditions of the time demanded vagueness in treatment, and a concealment of the real intent of the piece. 3. The Word Election in American Politics, by Professor Fisk P. Brewer, of Grinnell, Iowa; read, in the author's absence, by the Secretary. Election, in a political sense, was formerly limited to 'the act of choosing a a person to fill an office or employment.' The new sense, not yet recognized in dictionaries, is a voting at the polls to ratify or reject a proposed measure. The first known example of its use is in the Constitution of Delaware, I831. It is found in the more recent Constitutions and laws of several of the United States (Tennessee constitutional convention, 1834; Ohio, I85I), and is now uzed freely in regard to voting on such matters as farm-fencing, public libraries, issu- ing of bonds and prohibiting of saloons. The uzage is not yet familiar in England. An English writer in the Quarterly Review, Oct. 1884, is consequently led into a mistake in speaking of constitu- tional amendments in America. The language of the New Jersey Constitution of I844, "the people, at a special election to be held for that purpose only, shall ratify and approve," he interprets as implying that for ratification ther is to be "a special legislature specially elected for the purpose of giving or refusing it." Ther is no special legislature: the people vote directly "yes " or "no." 4. Contributions to the Grammar of the Cypriote Inscriptions, by Professor Isaac H. Hall, of the Metropolitan Museum, New York, N.Y. vii Vll</page><page sequence="8">viii Ame.rican Philological Association. The speaker presented a specimen of the Fornenzlehre of the Cypriote inscrip- tions, the whole subject to be embodied in a paper nearly completed. The speci- men included the personal pronouns, with a few adjective pronouns. Since the presentation of the specimen, however, other inscriptions have been discovered; and it seems best to withhold the paper until the new material can be worked up. Remarks upon the paper were made by Dr. H. W. Smyth, and in reply by Professor Hall. 5. Ashtoreth, the Canaanitish Goddess; a New Etymology pro- posed, by Professor James S. Blackwell, of the University of Mis- souri, Columbia, Mo. The revisers of the Old Testament have ejected from the English version the word "grove" or "groves," and retained the Hebrew 'Ashera and 'Ashertm, adding the cautious conjecture: "Probably the wooden symbols of a goddess Asherah." The etymology of 'Ashera and 'Ashtoreth has given rise to many attempts at solution. The LXX has rendered 'Ashera by 'Aordpr-7 (II Chron. 15: I6). Schlottman (Riehm's Handw6rterb. des bibl. Alterth., I884,4 s. v. Asch- toreth) says: "Astarte und Aschera [sind] die beiden im A. T. gew6hnlichen Namen der grossen kanaanitischen G6ttin." Canon Rawlinson (note on Ex. 34: I3, Ellicott's Commentaries), believes "the very name Asherah was a modifi- cation of Ashtoreth or Astarte." The original identity of the two names is all but universally admitted. Frequent mention of 'Ashtoreth (Ishtar) is found in the Assyrian (Schrader, Keilinschr. und das A. T., p. I762), and it cannot be doubted that the name came westward from the Tigris (Lenormant, Origines de l'Histoire, p. 89). The symbol of 'Ashtoreth was a mass of wood, like a tree, planted in the ground (Jud. 6: 26; II Kings 7: Io; Deut. 6: 21); that is, the trunk of a tree without root so planted. Various interpretations have been given of the meaning of these symbols. Schlottmann regards her as a dea mulliformis, representing the receptive, bearing principle, in opposition to Ba'al, the active, producing principle. Rawlinson thinks the symbols as " probably emblematic of the productive powers of nature." Gesenius regards 'Ashera as the Goddess of Fortune. In the Assyrian inscriptions Ishtar is called the Ruler of the Battle, the Princess of the Gods, the Mother of the Gods (urn ii), etc. Considered etymologically, Gesenius derives 'Ashtoreth from the Persian, an opinion shared by Movers, Fiirst, Gotch in Smith's Bible Dict., and many others. Nicholson (Alexander's Kitto's Cyclop.) calls it the " best etymology." Lenor- mant makes it cognate with 'Ashshar. Gesenius takes W0K ('to be prosperous') as the origin of 'Ashbra. Schlottmann makes 'Asheia and 'Ashtoreth doublets from IWtY ('to unite') "mit Beziehung sowol auf die Zeugung, als auf die das ganze Weltall zusammenbindende Macht." Schrader says that 'Ashtoreth is hardly a Semitic divinity, and that no satisfactory derivation can be found in the Semitic languages. On account of the termination tar, he would refer the word to the Turanian family. Now, I venture the conjecture that 'Asht3reth (Aram- aized from 'Ashtareth, cf: Ishtar and 'AardpTr) is explainable as an example of false popular etymology. The Assyrian Ish-tar-at, on its introduction into the west, was to the Canaanites an unmeaning sound. In the homogeneous Hebrew</page><page sequence="9">Proceedings for yuly, 1886. the intrusion of a rootless word was insufferable. If a name was not significant, it was referred to a significant root (cf. Babel, Moshe, etc.). Words, like Che- dorlaomer, which belonged to the annalist alone, were left undisturbed in the written record. But 'Ashtoreth was a popular divinity, whose rites were even confounded with those of Yahveh. The popular etymologist explained Ish-tar-at n-W'Vy ('wood of service'), a compound, which, by the laws controlling sibi- lants, would shift to 'Ashtareth. Tree-worship preceded Yahveh-worship. The root ni'I is used of Yahveh-worship especially, and the first revelation of Yahveh was in a burning-bush. Many things led to a syncretistic stage of worship. We see a natural explanation of the "groves" set up, in default of natural groves, of wooden stelae, wherever the goddess was worshipped. As to 'Ashera, this is the Semitic form, from the root ^'WZ ('to go before'), found in Arabic and Assyrian; we hence see the fitness of her appellations, the Princess of the Gods, the God of the Morning Star, etc. (cf. Jer. 7: I8). In the. oldest records Ishtar has no gender. If 'It ('to precede') be a Semitic translation of Ishtar, we may here have a name for the Supreme Divinity long prior to the anthropomorphic attribution of gender, when. the deity was both father and mother, as in the prayers of Theodore Parker, and also in the Elohistic account of the creation (Gen. I: 27): "And God created man in his own image . . . male and female created he them." Remarks were made upon this paper by Professor M. Jastrow, Jr., and by Mr. C. Adler. 6. The Sources of Seneca's De Beneficiis, by Harold N. Fowler, Ph.D., of Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. The sources of Seneca's philosophical writings are difficult to discover, because he does not follow his authorities as closely as Cicero does. The books de Bene- ficiis naturally fall into three divisions: the first, books I.-IV., the second, books V. and VI., the third, book VII. The first of these divisions is shown by internal evidence and comparison with passages in Cicero de C)fficiis, to be based upon a work of Hekaton. The second division is less evidently the work of the same mind; but it shows such plain evidence of being derived from the school of Panaitios, and in those cases in which any disagreement with Panaitios appears, the very disagreement points so directly to Hekaton, that this division must also be attributed to him. The third division (Bk. VII.) agrees so well in all respects with what precedes, that it would be needless, not to say unscientific, to suppose that Seneca drew this part of the work from any other source than that from which the rest was derived. The division into three parts was, then, probably not original with Seneca. The work of Hekaton from which Seneca took his mate- rial was probably the one entitled 7repl KaOIKovros. The Association adjourned to 8 P.M. ix</page><page sequence="10">x American Philological Association. ITHACA, N. Y., Tuesday, July 13, i886. EVENING SESSION. The Association was called to order by the President at 8.15 P. M. Through Professor W. T. Hewett, of Cornell University, Chairman of the local committee of arrangements, the Association was invited, on the part of Messrs. Henry Morgan and other citizens of Aurora, N. Y., to attend a reception to be given to the members on Wednes- day afternoon, July 14. It was also announced that the various buildings, and collections of Cornell University, would be open to the Association during the session. The President, after a tribute to the memory of the late Professor Charles D. Morris, made a brief address of congratulation, in which he took occasion to explain the omission of the usual Annual Ad- dress, caused by his ill-health. The reading of papers was then continued. 7. The Vowels o and u in English, by Benjamin W. Wells, Ph. D., of the Friends' School, Providence, R. I.; read, in the author's absence, by Dr. C. P. G. Scott, of Washington, D. C. The paper began with an account of the development of Old Germanic o and u in English. The word-lists were said to show that no Indo-Germanic a became u, and no Indo-Germanic u became o in Old Germanic. All Old Germanic o were regarded as from Indo-Germanic a, and all Old Germanic u from Indo-Germanic z. The development of these two sounds in English was nearly identical; both were represented in OE. by o, unless followed by a nasal, when both became u, or unless umlaut changed either to y. Before an a, o, u in a following syllable, however, u was not changed to o. To these rules there were found but eight exceptions. The point of view was then changed, and oE. o, u, y were examined, and the origin of each shown in detail; and in a third section their development in New English was examined. The sounds in New English were taken as the basis of comparison, and the letters noticed subordinately. Old English o was shown to produce seven sounds in New English, as may be heard in the words not, hole, storm, word, zoomb, should, welkin. These sounds were spelled o, oa, ou, ow, u, e, with small regard to the pronunciation. OE. u and y were treated in the same manner. In the fourth section the NE. sounds were examined. Those of lower pitch than a, which alone were treated in this paper, were heard in all, hole, tool, and the diphthong owl. The OE. sounds firom which they proceeded, and the condi- tions of their development, were shown. Thus the sound heard in all was found to be used for OE. a, ia, o, a, often; and less commonly for ae, eo, u, ae, ea, eo, o. In almost every case, 99 out of 104, the sound was found before or after r or e, or where g or w had been absorbed into the vowel. The spelling of the sound</page><page sequence="11">Proceedings for yuly, 1886. xi was usually ou (ow), au (aw), but o, oa, oo also occurred. The other sounds were treated in the same manner. In the fifth section the source of the New English letters was shown. The letters considered were au, aw, o, oa, oe, oo, ou, ow, u, ue. They were treated in the same manner as the sounds. In this paper, and in the author's papers previously published (Transactions, Vols. XII. and XVI.; Anglia, Vol. VII.), every Old English word with a New English equivalent, and every New English word that can be traced to an Old English source, has been classified, both, in its sound and its spelling. There may have been omissions, but the intention has been in every case to make the word-lists complete, and so to afford a complete apparatus for the further study of English vowels. Dr. Scott made a few remarks upon the paper. 8. A Translation of the Katha Upanishad, by Professor William D. Whitney, of Yale College, New Haven, Conn. The speaker laid before the meeting a new version of the Upanishad; but, instead of reading it through, he remarked upon the Upanishad literature in gen- eral, in its relation to the history of religious thought in India, and set forth briefly the grounds of special importance of the Katha. The work, namely, pro- fesses to contain a solution of the problem of death, coming from the mouth of Death himself; and hence it cannot help giving interesting indications as to the state of opinion on that subject, as prevailing at its period; and particularly as to the doctrine of transmigration of souls, a doctrine wholly unknown to the Vedic hymns, and only developing itself during the Upanishad period. Such indica- tions have to be culled out and put together, since they exist in the little treatise only in a scattered and indefinite form; of definite statement and connected exposition or argument, there is nothing whatever. Moreover, it is altogether probable that the text, as we have it, is composite, and of different age, the Upanishad part of it having been added to a story originally intended to explain a certain ceremony (the trinaciketa) to be performed by one desiring to secure heaven. Setting aside minor inconsistencies, the doctrine of the treatise was, by a quotation of all its passages bearing upon the several points, shown to be sub- stantially as follows: that those who have a satisfactory record in this life go, after death, to a world of happiness, in which they enjoy immortality; while those of a contrary character are condemned to fall again and again under the power of Death, or to undergo a round of successive existences, in both living and lifeless forms. That is to say, the old Vedic heaven remains, to be tenanted by the worthy; there is no hell; but the retribution of the unworthy is beginning to be seen in an exclusion from heaven involving the renewal of life on the earth. The criterion of worthiness or unworthiness, it should be added, is rather right knowledge than right conduct. The differences between this doctrine and the fully worked-out later metempsychosis are obvious. It appears impossible to regard the element of metempsychosis itself as having a popular origin, as devel- oping by any natural process out of the older forms of Hindu religion; it must have been, as it here exhibits itself, rather the product of a school of religious</page><page sequence="12">American Philological Association. philosophy - though winning afterward a general currency and acceptation, as is testified by its underlying the later systems of philosophy, including the philoso- phy of Buddhism. 9. Provincialisms of the "Dutch" Districts of Pennsylvania, by Lee L. Grumbine, Esq., of Lebanon, Pa.; read, in the author's absence, by the Secretary. The locality which this list of local words and expressions represents is that portion of Pennsylvania, geographically marked out by the Delaware River and the Allegheny Mountains, Mason and Dixon's line on the south, and the tier of counties bordering on New York on the north. Of course within this territory there are exceptional communities; those, namely, in which the Scotch-Irish and the Quaker elements prevail, as also some of the larger cities. The writer attempted no more than to gather together a number of the colloquial expres- sions that are common among the common people of this district. Most of these expressions, as might be supposed by one who knows the history of this part of the country, have their origin in the German language. Thus " Spritz," from spritzen, to 'spatter' or 'squirt,' was bodily incorporated by the Pennsyl- vania schoolboy into his English vocabulary. "Snitz," from Schnitz, a 'slice,' is a word so common that the village grocer would be surprised to have a customer ask him for dried apples; while "snitz un'knp' " (from Kopf, a 'knob' or 'button '), as well the name as the thing, is a legacy which the Teutonic settlers of this region bequeathed to their heirs and assigns forever. The word "kn6p"' denotes a sort of dumpling, whose princi- pal ingredients are eggs, milk, flour, and yeast, which, with a complement of sliced sweet-apples, and a piece of ham or fresh pork, by way of seasoning, forms an olla podrida by no means to be despised. It is still a favorite dish, and its name is one of general adoption, only second in extent of usage to the now cos- mopolitan sour-kraut itself. " Speck " is the hybrid offspring of English pronunciation and German Speck (pronounced schpeck), the generic term applied to all kinds of fat meat. "Spook," from SpIk, a 'ghost' or 'hobgoblin,' although used by Bulwer in this sense, is, in this region, confined for the most part to the descendants of the Pennsylvania Germans. "Cellar-neck" (Keller-hals) is frequently heard for cellar-way; and "stove- plate " (Ofen-platte) for what is called stove-hearth in New England. Kerosene is always " coal-oil," and "sulphur " signifies, not the mineral which is known as brimstone, but the gas which escapes from a coal fire. In the third person, the title of a clergyman is used in the same direct way as that of a physician. It is not Mr. Dunbar, nor the Rev. Mr. Schautz, but "Rev. Dunbar " and " Rev. Schautz." "Dumb," from dumm, is used altogether in the sense of' stupid' or ' ignorant.' To speak of a " dumb " lawyer is not a contradiction of terms. "So " signifies without. Mrs. Krause tells her neighbor, Mrs. Strause, that her hired girl left her this morning (Mrs. K. says her "maid"), and that she will try to get along "so" for a time. "Wait on "is almost universally used instead of' wait for.' The shopping lady xii</page><page sequence="13">Proceedings for yuly, i886. xiii is obliged to "wait on" the clerk who is occupied with a prior customer, in order to be waited on in turn by him. Pennsylvania horses never draw a load, they "haul" it; probably from holen, to 'fetch' or 'bring.' The word "smart " attributes to a young person the quality of moral regularity, conveying precisely the same idea that the word "steady" does in many locali- ties. When used in connection with an elderly person, it implies unusual activity. The next to the last of anything is designated as "second last." The day of the week on which a certain event takes place is put in the plural form, e. g. Christmas comes on Saturdays this year. " Give " largely retains the meaning of geben, 'to yield,' as "give a good crop," and in connection with the weather it is not uncommon to hear "give rain" or "give snow." In "leave " there probably lingers a trace of the Saxon lefan, the word being used for 'permit'; and probably for the same reason, or by a mere sound resem- blance "left" has acquired the sense of let. Very often a bell "goes" when it should ring. '" Piece-way " of course signifies a part of the way, and " what for" a thing is supposed to be equivalent to what kind of a thing. "Ain't" is the common corruption of "it is not," or " it isn't," wherever the English language is spoken; but when it is used interrogatively, or by way of introducing a sentence, implying "isn't it so ?" or when it assumes the still more barbarous form of "ain't not?" persuasively entreating another's concession to the views of the person speaking, some sectional peculiarity may be claimed for it. But among all the expressions that are indigenous to this territory, and used by people who never dream that they are speaking German with English words, perhaps the most curious specimens are afforded by the singular use of the words "once," " still," "all," and "already." A remark in the nature of a request or an invitation always ends with the word "once," e. g. "Let me see 'once,'"1 "John, come here 'once,'" etc. This is simply the German idiom, ein Aoa, angli- cized. "Still" expresses habit. When young Miss Society tells young Miss Accom- plishments that she practises her piano lesson in the morning "still," she does not mean to say that she still continues to do so, implying a knowledge on the part of her friend, but simply that it is her habit to perform that task at that time. "Already " is a sort of auxiliary supposed to be necessary to complete the idea of the past tense. "I came this morning 'already." It has its equivalent in the German schon, as "all" has in alle - all gone. " The funds got all" would signify that the treasury was exhausted. It would be as difficult for the ordinary native to realize that all is not fully equivalent to all gone, as it would be to be- lieve that half of a thing is the whole. The writer knew a temporary coldness to spring up between two most estimable ladies (one a native, and the other a "for- eigner from New Jersey "), which is mentioned simply to show the peculiar use of this word, even among the intelligent and educated. Miss A. and Miss B. were teachers in the same boarding-school, and were in the habit of sharing their good things to eat. "Are your peaches all?" asked the native one day. "All what?" very naturally asked the foreigner. "Why, all; are they all?" expect- ing if they were "all," to send more. "Really, Miss A., I do not understand you; I have some yet." And it was well she had, for she receiyed no more from Miss B. But they speak to each other again.</page><page sequence="14">xiv American Philological Association.

Notes on Homeric Zoology, by Julius Sachs, Ph. D., of New York, N. Y. It was the aim of the paper to show that Buchholz, in that section of his Homerische Realien entitled "Homerische Zoologie," has presented neither a complete nor an undistorted picture of animal-life in the Homeric age. It is as unfair to assume the non-existence of certain animal-types in the Homeric age from their absence in the text of the poems, as it is injudicious to presuppose great familiarity with other types, mention of which occurs several times. For from the very nature of epic poetry the interest in the animal-world is subordinated to the overpowering interest that men and gods excite. Hence they constitute but a passing element in the actual economy of the poems, whereas they are promi- nently employed (I) in comparisons, and (2) as symbols of divinities, as tokens, miracles, etc. Some of the statistical results attained may be summarized as fol- lows: Of 62 animal-names recorded in the Iliad and Odyssey, but 20 (eliminat- ing doubtful cases) occur more than twice; again, 31 of the 62 species are never mentioned, except in comparisons. So detailed a knowledge of the animal- world, however, is obvious in connection with various rare and unusual species that the omission of reference to numerous other well-known types on the shores of the Aegean must be due to accident; an occasion to refer to their character- istics did not suggest itself.

The results of this investigation may now be briefly stated: - I. The eastern part of.North Greece was originally the abode of an Aeolic race whose dialect survived in Thessaly; and in Boeotia, but with less tenacity. In Boeotia the incursion of a foreign Doric element was not so successfully resisted as in the case of Thessaly, and it is to the influence of this foreign element that we owe, both in Thessaly and Boeotia, the existence of Doric forms, though thereby the possibility of later accessions is not denied. II. The dialect of the extreme western part of North Greece is pure North Doric, and absolutely free from the contamination of Aeolisnms. III. The dialects of Central North Greece are substantially North Doric in character; the Aeolisms which they contain are not survivals of an Aeolo-Doric period, but are purely adventitious, and their appearance is traceable up to cer- tain definite limits. 12. Assyrian, in its Relation to Hebrew and Arabic, by Profes- sor Morris Jastrow, Jr., of the University of Pennsylvania, Phila- delphia.</page><page sequence="19">Proceedings for zuly, 886. xix Accepting the proposition now generally entertained by Assyriologists, that Assyrian stands in a closer relation to Hebrew than to Arabic, this paper aimed to show more precisely of what nature the relation was in which Assyrian stands to the two sister tongues, and on what grounds a closer relation in favor of Hebrew could be predicated. After a general introduction on the advanced state which our knowledge of Assyrian has reached, thus rendering the treatment of questions which involve the application of critical philological methods possi- ble, and after setting forth the vacillating opinions of scholars until a short time ago as to the precise relation in which the language of the third species of cuneiform writing stood to Hebrew and Arabic, the writer endeavored to dem- onstrate that neither by an appeal to phonology nor to morphology could the question whether Assyrian bore a closer relation to Hebrew or to Arabic be satis- factorily answered, because of the many points of resemblance it offered to each of the other two. It was shown that, in general, the phonology or morphology of any of the Semitic languages does not affect, materially at least, the question as to the closer relation of any two of them to the exclusion of others, because the divergence which the languages manifest in this respect is due to the different stages of development in which the various Semitic languages, through their literatures, lie before us, and not due to different courses of development pur- sued by them. The writer then turned his attention to the vocabulary or word- stock of the Assyrian in comparison with that of the Hebrew and Arabic. Here alone, it was claimed, could a safe guide for a classification of Semitic languages be found. The general triliteral character of Semitic stems, those of more than three being not only comparatively rare, but in most cases only amplifications of triliterals, brings it about that the stems themselves are pretty nearly the same in all Semitic languages; and even of any stem, it cannot be said that it does not exist in this or that language, but only that it does not occur in the literary prod- ucts of that language, which are known to us.1 But in the development which common stems have taken in the various languages in the significations which in consequence they have acquired, there exists the very greatest divergence among some Semitic languages, but also great similarity among others. It was then shown, by taking up a number of stems, that their development in Assyrian agreed closely with Hebrew, and differed widely from Arabic; and as a further proof, numerous examples of words for common terms, and therefore in common use, were adduced, in which Assyrian coincided with Hebrew to the exclusion of Arabic, which employed for these terms words derived from totally different stems. On this ground of greater or less agreement in the development of the signification of stems, it was furthermore claimed, a broad distinction could be drawn between Northern and Southern Semitic languages, of which Hebrew and Arabic are respectively the chief representatives, - a distinction which points to a close relation among the nations speaking the languages thus grouped under the two heads. In relegating Assyrian, accordingly, to a place in the Northern branch, conclusions will be seen to follow of an historical and not merely of a philological nature. 1 An exception must be made in the case of modern Arabic, the only one of the Semitic languages which may be called in the full sense of the word a living one, and where, therefore, the non-occurrence of a stem allows us to assert its non-existence.</page><page sequence="20">XX American Philological Association.

The use of the term "root," in speaking of any language, implies the exist- ence there of groups of words of kindred significance containing a recognizable common element, which is the evident bearer of their common substantial mean- ing; this common element, deprived of all recognizable formative elements, is the root. There is no other acceptable definition of a root than this. How extensive the group of words must be to authorize the setting up of a root; whether there must be a verb in it--these and their like are minor questions, to be answered according to the circumstances of each case and the habits of the language to which it belongs. But we must beware of pushing the figure involved in "root" to the extent of regarding roots thus set up as the elements out of which the language containing them has grown. A given root may be more modern than certain or than all of the formative elements with which it is combined. This is clearly seen in those languages of which we are able to trace the history for a certain distance back. In a tongue of so widely and intimately mixed character as English, for example, the age and character of the radical elements is extremely heterogene- ous; and such ancient formative elements as the s of 3d sing. and the ing of pres. pple. are found affixed to roots of every period, from those of Indo-Euro- pean age, like bind and sing, down to borrowed fusions like count (computare) and cull (colligere), and even the latest creations of science and of slang. But also in a comparatively pure tongue, like the French, benir (benedicere) assumes just as simple and original an aspect as finir (finire), bldmner (blasphemare) and cotler (constare) and monter (denom. of montemr) as aimer (anmare), rendre (,reddere) and vendre (from venum dare) as fendre (fendere), and so on. If such things have come to pass during the historical periods of a lan- guage, then of course also during the utnhistorical. Every period shows the possession of roots that were wanting in preceding periods. The processes of linguistic growth are all the time bringing new materials into radical form. A certain body of roots we know to be of general Germanic value; but by no means all of them are Indo-European. A certain considerable body are plainly Indo-European; but how they attained that value we do not know; not one of them is necessarily other than the final result of processes of combination and fusion, like those illustrated above; the possibilities are as unlimited as our igno- rance, which is incapable of being ever removed. The recognized Indo-Euro- pean roots are doubtless so immensely later than the actual beginnings of human speech that the name of " modern " really belongs to them hardly perceptibly less than to the roots of French and of English language. When, therefore, we have anywhere demonstrated a root, we have reached no finality; we have taken only one step backward in the history of expression: a step to bc followed by others if we find ourselves able to take them. The claim that roots are the beginnings of speech does not refer to any particular body of roots, known or ever to be known; it means only that the first spoken signs contained no formative ele- ments, were destitute of grammatical character, any sign of such character being possible only as the result of growth.</page><page sequence="21">Proceedings for uly, 1886. It may be open to question whether the term " root," when stripped of the false value it originally possessed, and which even now in no small measure clings to it, is worth retaining in linguistic phraseology. That, however, is a matter of minor importance; the essential thing is that whoever uses it should be well aware of how much and how little it implies. If duly employed, it has its usefulness; and it is by no means likely to be abandoned. 14. Analogy and the Scope of its Application in Language, by Professor B. I. Wheeler, of Cornell University. The paper essayed a classification of the generally accepted though scattered material illustrative of the operation of analogy in language, discussed the prin- ciples underlying its action, the scope of its application and the practical limita- tions of its use in the explanations of forms; and finally, with the help of a classified bibliography, reviewed the history of its recent methodological employ- ment in determining the nature of linguistic growth. As a collection of spoken symbols, language'is physiologically conditioned; as a collection of sound-pictures stored away beneath the levels of consciousness, it is psychologically conditioned; and in the investigation of linguistic phe- nomena a rigid discrimination between the operation of the physiological and of the psychological factors, i. e. between the operation of phonetic laws and of the principles of analogy, is indispensable. Any given phonetic law holds only for a restricted dialectic community, whereas psychological laws, being based upon universal principles of the human mind, are of universal application, and their action in the particular case is determined solely by the relations existing in the storehouse of memory between the various word-pictures or sentence-pictures. Again, a given law of sound has application to the entire like-conditioned mate- rial of a given language, whereas the intervention of a possible analogy is never necessary. Thirdly, the operation of the laws of sound is unconscious and gradual, so that, except through mixture of dialect, the old form cannot survive alongside the new, whereas the products of analogy do not necessarily displace the older forms; thus Germ. gediegen survives in a special use beside the newer gediehen. The phenomena of analogy are ultimately referable to the unconscious effort of the mind, in its quest for unity, to reduce the apparently incongruous elements of speech to systems and groups. The folk-mind is no etymologist, and knows forms only in their'present relations. The establishment of these groups takes place upon the basis of likeness of function, similarity of signification coupled with general likeness of function, similarity of form coupled with general like- ness of function, and likeness of signification. I. Likeness of function. This applies to certain significant elements of words unlike in form and signification. I. Grouping of like cases from different stems. The establishment of system around two axes of arrangement is generally involved; a partial accord of two inflectional systems mediates the levelling of other parts; :WwKpd7r1v (for :wKpdfrpt) ocvLv: WovvP87iSv: : oovvpds a: oiu s; so " Chinee " (for Chinese): tree (etc.) :: Chinese (pl.): trees (etc.). 2. Correspond- ing forms from different verbs; Engl. shaped, swelled, zept, replace shope, swoll, wep, under the proselyting influence of the weak conjugation. 3. Like elements xxi</page><page sequence="22">xxii XXll American Philological Association. in composition; TrLJOKpaTeia (Ti/A), ratLorpiTp/3r (Irat-) follow the fashionable type of ;o-yovia, rITroiETprls, etc. 4. Like suffixal inflections attach to like in- flections of idea. (a) Formation of new words; e. g. the suffix -able is at home in Romance words like agreeable, but is secondarily applied in others like read- able. (b) Modification of existing words (growth of suffixes); rp/i-aTos (for rpi-ros) followed 8EKa-Tos, etc. II. Similarity of si,nification coupled zoil/ likeness of function. The line of division between this and the preceding category is of varying distinctness. I. Word-pairs of contrasted signification; Lat. senexter (= sinister): dexter; Engl. female (for *femelle) : male; --KC-rcL : oJKETL; EKvpos (for *eCvpos) : Kcupd. 2. Series of names; e. g. the numerals, cf. M. H. G. elf (for eilf): zzelf; icra (for *C.Lx): 'ra, OrTa. 3. Approximately synonymous words partially harmo- nized; Span. estrella has its -r- from astro. 4. Unlike names of members of a category partially harmonized; Fr. ele (masc.) has its gender from hiver, prin- temps. 5. Learned, though often unconscious, comparison; e. g. fault (for faute) under the influence of fallere or its derivatives; throne (for trone) through influence of Opovos. III. Similarity of form coupled woith general likeness of function. Identity replaces similarity of form; surgery (for *sirurgy) accepts the modish cut of names of activities like sorcery, thievery. IV. Identify in signfication (of various forms of same stem or base). To this is largely due the so-called regularity of inflectional systems. I. Different cases of same stem. (a) Nominative follows oblique cases; Lat. honor (= honos) from honorema, etc. Germ. rauh (for ranch, cf. rauchwaaren). (b) Nomin. sing. less frequently influences other cases; Eng. whatfs (wharves), roofs, etc. (c) Oblique cases levelled; rXAETo, for 7roA,to (Ion.). 2. Different persons of same tense; Germ. fliegt for fleugt; Engl. "says I" like says he. 3. Different "parts" of same verb; 3Ei3XEeqa for *B3g0Aoa, cf KecXAocfa. 4. Derivative and primitive; national (for national) from nhation; or Lesb. 7rE'7re from r-w7tros. Proportional or relative analogy. A large part of the phenomena involved in the above considerations is referable to a tendency toward forming not alone harmonizing series, but parallel systems of harmonious series, i. e. toward establishing order around two axes of arrangement. The form of a proportion may therefore be sought; thus *habutus (for habitus) upon which is based Ital. avuto, Fr. eu, etc.; tribui: tribitus:: habui: *hazbuits. After a consideration of the merely " graphic " analogies (could like would, etc.), and a discussion of the importance of " isolated" fornm anld of the various conditions for their preservation, there followed a summarized statement of the principles governing the application of analogy to language and limiting its prac- tical use as a factor in linguistic investigations. A chronologically classified bibli- ography of over 75 titles furnished a basis for a brief history of the recently increasing recognition of this element in the growth of language, and of its more extended employment in the explanation of forms. Though sporadically recog- nized bv the earlier writers, Bopp, Pott, Benfey, general statements of principle were first made by Curtius and Whitney, and their extended practical application in investigations dates from the year 1876.

This paper was prefaced by the statement that the title "Southernisms" was, strictly speaking, a misnomer; for, though it had been originally intended to dis- cuss only usages peculiar to the South, it had been ascertained by much corre- spondence that most of those here treated are known to some extent in the West also. The reason for this, in cases where the words seem to have been borrowed from the South, was probably mainly emigration from the Southern States to Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois especially, aided by the fact that so many thousands of Union soldiers were quartered for a longer or shorter time in the South during the Civil War. Some of these words, which are survivals of Old English, or Provincial English usage, were doubtless once as common in New England and the Middle States as in the South, and may be rather survivals among Western descendants of Eastern emigrants than importations from the South. The plan pursued in preparing this paper was the same as that followed in getting material for the former paper on the same sulject (Transactions, Vol. XIV., I883), namely, to submit lists of words supposed to be "Southernisms" to acquaintances in various parts of the North and Northwest. But the only perfectly safe method of making such a collection would be for persons who are fond of dialect studies to make glossaries of provincialisms cur- rent in limited sections. A comparison of these glossaries from various sections would then determine what is Southern, etc. The discussion is here confined to such words as have Old or Provincial Eng- lish authority, and appended is a list of some of the commonest Southern expres- sions that have not such authority: - To battle (beat) clothes in washing; battling-stick; biddable (obedi- ent); bealing (boil or sore); to cacky (alvum exonerare); comb (ridge, of a house); to contrary; cymbling or simlin (squash); endurable (durable); to fair off (clear off); to feaze (to fret); fice (small dog); haffen (half); ill (vicious); lef' be (let be); less (shorter of stature); to list (to make bed of cotton-row); low (short); to norate (to spread a report); piggin (small pail); pomped (pampered); punk (a prostitute); queer (sickish); to red or red up (to make ready); redding-comb (opp. to tuck-comb); to reluctate (to be reluctant); ridgling or rigil (half gelt beast); ridiculous (outrageous); sashararer (corruption of certiorari); smidgen (small bit, grain of meal); soon (early); stinted (in foal); sudden (hasty or quick-tempered); sweltry (sultry); swipe (a blow); usen (usaunt); weddiner (wedding-guest); to whindle (to cry peevishly). The following words and expressions have not Old English or Provincial authority: - And all, what and all; ambia or ambur (tobacco-juice); ambition (grudge or spite); banquette or bankit (sidewalk in New Orleans); boy (negro-man); branch (brooklet); break (a sale of tobacco at opening of the hogsheads, Va.); bright (color of light mulatto); buckra (boss, negro term, S. C.); by sun (before sunset); cavort (curvet); chiravari (pron. chivaree, sort of horn serenade); court-house (county town, Va. and S.

The datives in Sophokles' plays and fragments were collected and classified, in order to determine definitely the Sophoklean usage. Such a collection may be useful in detecting corrupt readings, and in throwing light on the state of the language at this time, as well as in furnishing some material for a more exact study of the dative case. With this latter aim, the classification has been made as full and exact as possible. The Greek dative is easily divided into the three cases which it historically represents; viz., the pure dative, the locative, and the instrumental. 1 The account for the Proceedings for I884 was settled in the preceding financial year; see Proceedings for I885, p. xxx. 2 The bill for Proceedings and Transactions (Vol. XVI.) for I885, this day ren- dered, is $975.77; the balance to be paid in the next financial year is, therefore, $675.77.</page><page sequence="26">American Philological Association. A. The pure dative expresses the person (rarely the thing) affected by the action of the sentence. In the dative of advantage, or in the ethical dative, this is most clearly seen. 1148 cases, I7% lyrical. This rubric includes 37% of all the datives. These may be divided into the datives in close connection with verbs, and those more independently used. I. I. Datives with verbs meaning 'to say,' etc., 'to give,' 'to show to,' etc., 338, I .5% lyrical. 2. Datives with impersonal verbs, with verbs meaning 'to help,' 'serve,' 'trust,' etc., and with verbs and other words expressing disposition, 212, 12% lyrical. 3. Dative with substantive verbs, 64, I4% lyrical. II. The dative in more independent use, dative of interest. I. Dative denoting advantage or disadvantage, 106, 20% lyrical. 2. Dative of interest without such idea of advantage, 231, 28% lyrical. Dative with interjections, ,utot (mostly lyrical) and oftoi, I Io, 69% lyrical. 3. Ethical dative, 47, 38% lyrical. 4. Dative in close connection with nouns, 40, 21% lyrical. Under (2) is included the peculiar dative denoting 'in the opinion of' (40% lyrical), the dative with seXoltaL, and such cases as the following: OT. 735, xp6vos ,o78' erlvv ouAE7EXvOcos; Ph. 285, O 46e Xpdvos ? . . . rpovBaive ioi. Of the ethi- cal datives, 33% may be classified as precative (6o% lyrical). As a striking exam- ple of the use with nouns may be cited El. 343, 0-ol -&amp;a&amp; vovPOETtuaTa. B. The Locative Dative. The dative is used to denote position in space, in condition, or in time; also to denote the place of the end of an action, the goal of motion. I 135 cases (564 with prepositions), 23% lyrical. I. Locative denoting ' where.' I. Position in space (a), or in condition (b). a. Place in or at which, 'in a house,' etc., 78, 29% lyrical. With preposition (ev), I86, I6% lyrical. Place on which, 'on a road,' etc., 65, I5% lyrical. With prepositions (e'ri), 89, 26% lyrical. b. Condition, 'in honor,' etc., 71, I6% lyrical. With preposition, I6o, 22% lyrical. Sphere of action, 'in old age,' etc., I6, 44% lyrical. With prepositions, 22, 27% lyrical. Various adverbial forms, 7ro?, 'Ke?, and rratpv, etc., may be included here for convenience. c.

The locative dative is used with certain verbs. The six datives in Sophokles with verbs of ruling, seem to belong rather under the dative of interest. There are II datives, none lyrical, with verbs meaning ' to rejoice in.' xxvi</page><page sequence="27">Proceedings for 7uly, I886. xxvii 3. Position in time, 32, 19%/ lyrical. With preposition (ev and idr), 20, none lyrical. II. The locative is extended to express the place where an action ceases. I. In place. With verbs like &amp;,yw, 4ffpw (one with ev), 79, 22% lyrical. With TrCTrw, and the like, 17, 42% lyrical. With 3BdXCo, Vrirrwo, and the like (3 with ev), 25, 23% lyrical. The occasional use of iv points to the locative origin. 2. In time (7 with ev), 25, I6% lyrical. C. The instrumental dative includes two quite distinct uses, the sociative, and the instrumental proper, 854 (with prep. 98), 27% lyrical. I. The sociative is treated first as perhaps the earlier use, 332 (with prep. 98), 22% lyrical. I. The simple idea of association is usually expressed by a preposition, even in poetry. There are, however, in Sophokles, 9 cases, 6 lyrical, referring to per- sons, and IO cases, 2 lyrical, referring to things, without the preposition. For example, Ph. 647, vavfl3iTr7s 7ifuv. Only one case has the accompanying auv,s so common in Homer; Ai. 27, avrois &amp;rs-TdaToLs. With ouv there are 26 datives, I8% lyrical, referring to persons, and 69, 12% lyrical, referring to things. 2. With words compounded with a6,b, 97, 25% lyrical. 3. The sociative is used with verbs indicating 'to follow,' I, 27% lyrical. With piSyvvl:i, (evSiYvva, etc., II, 27% lyrical. With J.dXoJuai, and the like, I4, 35% lyrical. With 7reXdC(w, 7rXialov, etc., 12, 25% lyrical. With words denoting likeness, 8, 25% lyrical. Denoting equality, 17, 5.6% lyrical. Denoting identity with, I4, none lyrical. II. The instrumental idea is closely connected with the sociative, so closely that the sociative preposition a-v is often used to express instrument; Ai. 30, yV t?pELI. 522, 22% lyrical. I. Datives clearly instrumental in origin: - a. Instrumental proper, including 32 cases denoting 'by a weapon,' and 90 cases denoting 'by a part of the body.' 175, 24% lyrical. b. Instrumental denoting means, including 22 cases, with verbs, as rii7rA7ju,,, I6I,, 20% lyrical. c. Instrumental denoting manner. Compare locative of condition. 14 cases have a trace of the sociative idea, Tr. 845, /oA\dvr' ovi.laLL ffuvahAayaZs; 6 cases an idea of means; 10 cases with cognate verbs, Ph. 225, KicvT elo-avYres; 79. d. Instrumental denoting cause, 58, 21% lyrical. 2. The dative expressing agent is placed here rather than with the dative of interest. Such an extension of the instrumental, so as to apply to persons, an extension which takes place in Sanskrit, seems more natural than a restriction of the dative of interest. a. With verbals in -rds and -reos, 17, 12% lyrical. b. With aorist passive, 9, 1% lyrical. c. With other passive forms, I3, 8% lyrical.</page><page sequence="28">American Philological Association. 3. Dative expressing degree of difference. Io, io% lyrical. There are some connecting links in Sophokles' uses between the three divis- ions of the dative. a. The locative expressing condition is not definitely separated from the instru- mental denoting manner. b. The locative expressing the goal of an action is sometimes similar to the dative of interest; more often to the dative of indirect object. c. The connection between the two uses of the instrumental is evident. d. The dative of agent with passives is closely allied to the pure dative with adjectives. The dative with IX0p4s does not differ essentially from the dative with eX0apro os. These doubtful sections include only 4% or 5% of all the datives. Remarks were made upon the paper by Professors B. L. Gilder- sleeve and J. H. Wright. I7. The Sequences of Tenses in Latin,l by Professor William Gard- ner Hale, of Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. It was shown that the doctrine of the sequence is honeycombed with excep- tions in nearly all the constructions of the language, - consecutive clauses after ut, consecutive relative clauses, causal sentences, concessive sentences, the indi- rect discourse, conditions, conclusions and the like, final clauses. In the case of each one of these exceptions, the explanation given by the adherents of the doc- trine of the sequence was that the meaning of the tense was so and so. But if it were granted that the tense had a certain meaning after a certain main verb, it was unreasonable, without express evidence, to postulate the loss of that meaning after other main verbs. Under these circumstances, it was sound procedure to set up for examination the hypothesis to which the results so far led, namely, that the dependent subjunc- tive always had temporal expressiveness. Against this view six objections might be brought, all of which, however, disappeared under examination: I) The fact that the phenomena were mostly in accordance with the supposed rule, arose from the fact that the ideas naturally arising in the mind were mostly such as would necessarily be expressed by tenses dealing with the same point of view, namely, that of the speaker's present, or that of some already past time. 2) The fact that exceptions did not occur in the antequam group was due to the very nature of the mode, which expressed a thought of an actor in the main sentence, and so necessarily had to lie at the same time with the act of that sentence. 3) The imperfect, used commonly in clauses of result attached to causes lying in the past, was shown to have been originally an independent subjunctive, looking forward from a connection with a past point of view (and so expressing tendency), and still re- taining the power, not held by the aorist, of throwing the result into the same group with the act of the main verb. 4) The occasional use of the imperfect and plu- perfect in expressing facts recognized as generally outside of the context, was 1 Printed in full in the American Journal of Philology, Vol. VII., No. 28, and Vol. VIII., No. 29. xxviii</page><page sequence="29">Proceedings for yuly, 1886. shown to represent such a general fact as existing at the time of, and felt in con- nection with, the main fact on which it bore. 5) The use of the imperfect and pluperfect in similar clauses depending on conditions or conclusions contrary to fact was shown not to be mechanical, but to proceed from a delicate modal feel- ing, partly familiar in English, existing consistently in the main idea, and in subordinate ideas that formed an integral part of it. 6) The explanation of the common use of the forms -turnzs, fuerit, etc., in ut- and quiz-clauses was shown to proceed from a special fondness for this form of expression, since here, too, Cicero uses the simple secondary form with some freedom, even after primary tenses. The sound doctrine, therefore, was that the tenses of the subjunctive every- where conveyed temporal ideas. The position that might possibly be taken, that the tenses of the subjunctive had temporal expressiveness where they were used in violation of the supposed law of the sequence, that is, in unusual combinations, but were used as mere speech-types in the usual combinations, was shown to be untenable on account of certain specific indications of the temporal expressiveness of the tense even where there was no violation of the supposed law. The meaning of each tense of the indicative and subjunctive, original and acquired, was then given, and suggestions were made for the treatment of the matter in dealing with beginners. In conclusion, the history of the doctrine advocated in the paper was sketched, and indications pointed out of the probable future of opinion upon the subject. I8. The Survival of Gender in this and that,' by Professor Lemuel S. Potwin, of Adelbert College, Cleveland, Ohio; read by title. When "this" or "that" is used substantively, without definition or qualifica- tion, it means this or that thing, never this or that person. What is this but a silent survival of the Anglo-Saxon neuters Pis and xcet? That here is a genuine neuter bias is confirmed by the fact that, in the plural, where the Anglo-Saxon shows no distinction of gender, "these" and "those" are now applied substantively to both persons and things. This neuter is the more noteworthy because it is maintained at considerable inconvenience. To say always "this man," "this woman," "this child," instead of simply " this," is laborious, - seems directly in the teeth of the principle of least effort. This persistence is illustrated in a different way by seeing how early the neuter came to be used adjectively for all genders, ' that " being so used in the Ormulum, and "this " not much later. Still more striking is the Anglo-Saxon use of pis and pbat with substantives not neuter in assertions with the verb to be, as " Pis is se6 eoroe." These cases show how near the usage could come to the loss of gender-distinction, and yet not lose it; for, after all, we cannot to-day say simply "this " and " that" without reaffirming the ancient gender-inflection. 1 The Wyclif Bible has " this " for " this man "; e. g. " This was with Jhesu of Naza- reth." Matt. 26: 71. Cf. Shaks., Mid. Sum. N. D. I. i. 28.

March, of Lafayette College, Easton, Pa. It has been claimd that the number of once-used words in the Shakespeare Concordance is so extraordinary as to show that the plays from which the Con- cordance is made must be by different authors. I hav had the words in a couple of letters counted and compared with those in Milton, Pope, Tennyson, and the Bible. The Shakespeare counts ar from Clarke, Furness, and Schmidt's Lexicon; the Milton from Prendergast; the Pope from Abbott; the Tennyson from Bright- well (1869); the Bible from Cruden. The different forms of a verb or noun ar united in one word in Schmidt, but counted separately in the others.

Various relations between the numbers and percentages wer pointed out. As to the nature of the once-used words, it was said that they wer not for the most part coinages to express striking original thought, but the less frequently used grammatical forms or derivativs of familiar words, or compounds with living affixes, such as all- and mis-, variations of spelling, and names of objects which happen to be mentiond, -plants, utensils, and the like. In Tennyson a con- siderabl number of new compounds occur, which embody some new fancy or other shade of poetic thought. The secret of Shakespeare's power is not to be found in these words, nor in twice or thrice used words, but in his use of the hundred or thousand times used words. It is the second rate or third rate anthors who use the greatest floods of words. The first-rates work with select materials. "The compulsiv power of a limited vocabulary " was discust. 20. On Consonant Notation and Vowel Definition, by Professor Francis A. March, of Lafayette College, Easton, Pa. The sound commonly thought of as belonging to a consonant has three parts: (I) the sound made while the organs ar closing, (2) the sound or rest while they ar at closure, (3) the sound made while opening. In English spelling a printed letter sometimes represents only one of these sounds, sometimes two, rarely all three. It is desirabl to hav scientific notation to distinguish them. We may use figures I, 2, 3, or accents / - ', as follows: XXX</page><page sequence="31">Proceedings for ruly, I 886. xxxi A. Sounded while closing only: 'p or lp in u'pmost, to'pmost, halpn. B. While closing and at closure: 1,2m or '-m in al,2mple, al 2mber, te'-mper, co'-mpose, ca'ndy, u'nto, u'ndone. C. At closure only: fat2n or fat'n, eat'n, writ2n, el,2mbold2n. D. At closure and opening: m'a or m2,3a, m'ost, n2 3ew. E. While opening only: p and t in p3o-t3a-t30, al 2mp312e, te'm p'er, t31 2n- t0ine. F. Sound closing with sound or rest at closure and sound at opening, is almost always printed with two letters: u3l2nn2'3oticed, sou'-ll-'ess, fou'-ll'y, ou'-t 'ravel. Pronouncing vocabularies hav indicated these distinctions to some extent by separating words into syllabls, and doubling the consonant when the opening and closing ar both herd. A hyphen after a consonant indicates the closing sound: bar-on-ess; before it, the opening sound: sallow-ness; gemination, both sounds: bar-ren-ness. This notation is but rudely applied, however; especially in gemi- nation, and Dr. Murray in the Historical Dictionary rejects all division of syllabls. This leavs these consonant distinctions without direct notation, to be inferd from the adjacent letters. A direct notation would help to a more perfect knowledge of our habits of articulation, and perhaps to improvement of those habits. As far as we can judge from Dr. Murray's notation the English habits ar different from the American in a large number of words, especially in initial and final unaccented syllabls. Words, for exampl, beginning with prefixes from Latin ad-: attune, attract, acquire, ar pronounced a'-tt'une, al,2tt3ract, al,2cq3uire. But Dr. Murray, I conjecture, pronounces at3une, at3ract, ac3uire. More notation is needed especially with r and 1. When London fonetists write intrest, difrent, do they mean intr3est, difr3ent, or intr2,3est, difr23ent, or intlr2,3est, diflr2 3ent, dilf-rent, or dif rent? Does their gravly for gravelly mean gravl3y or grav2, 3y or gravl'2Sy ? "Is not the final r which they represent by the neutral vowel, really 'r? It is with me. The neutral vowel may be made with the organs in many positions; in father = f2a th3e'r the tung is raised to the r-position. Why do Londoners say 'my idea'-r' is'?" VOWEL DEFINITION. What is really needed for vowel definition is the vibrations of the sound at the ear. For accurate definition by means of description of the vocal organs curvs of the resonance chamber on a fine scale of decimals are needed. 21. The Authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews, by Rev. Dr. C. K. Nelson, of Brookeville Academy, Brookeville, Md. The arguments on this subject are classified under two general heads: external and internal evidence. The traditional argument has so long dominated public opinion, or rather, public sentiment, that it is difficult to obtain a hearing for the philological. The tradition of the Pauline authorship of the epistle rests on a weak foundation: while a tradition, to be trustworthy, must have its origin about the time of the alleged facts, this tradition cannot be traced to a period earlier than the third century A.D., or at least 130 years after the epistle was written. Anything like a general acquiescence in the tradition is not to be found until</page><page sequence="32">American Philological Association. some 200 years later. The negative tradition, however (that the epistle is not the work of St. Paul), is found in the earliest church writers whose works are authenticated, and is confirmed almost unanimously by the sounder criticism of the age following the Renaissance. The internal evidence, based mainly on lin- guistic grounds, is still stronger against the Pauline claim: I) The inscription of the codices is simply Ilpbs 'EB3palovs. 2) The mode of citing from the Old Testa- ment is different from that followed by St. Paul. 3) The citations are from the LXX, and when St. Paul cites from the LXX he uses a different codex. 4) The doctrinal teaching differs in many particulars, especially in the use of theological terms. 5) St. Paul, in each of his accepted epistles, avouches the epistle to be his. 6) Certain inaccuracies in the Textus Receptus have contributed to the im- pression that the work is St. Paul's. 7) The style of the epistle differs from that of St. Paul, (a) in the greater purity of the Greek, (b) in vocabulary, (c) in par- ticles of transition and in grammatical forms. 8) There are equally marked dif- ferences in logic and dialectic. 22. The Derivation of meridie,l by Professor Minton Warren, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.; read, in the author's absence, by Professor W. G. Hale. A recent attempt has been made by Stowasser (Archiv fur lateinische Lexi- kographie und Grammatik, Erster Jahrgang, pp. 273-277) to discard the long received etymology of meridie from medi-diie, and to derive it from meri-die = 'in bright daylight.' This view has been referred to with approval by Stolz, Osthoff, Wilhelm Meyer. The analogies of the Skt. madhyadina, Gk. tueco7z4pfa, Ger- man mittag, our midday, speak in favor of the old derivation. To deny it, is to impeach the credibility of Varro, not as an etymologist, but as an eye-witness. Compare De L. L. VI, 4 D antiqui non R in hoc dicebant ut Praeneste incisum in solario vidi. Stowasser's reason for doubting Varro is simply this :'D between vowels, in Latin, never passes into R. Stowasser has overlooked Donatus Comm. to Terence Adelph. V, 3, 62, Meridiem dixerunt veteres, quasi medidiem r pro d posita propter cognationem inter se literarum. - Examples were cited from the Umbrian of d becoming r (rs), from modern Greek of 5 becoming p, and in the Romance languages, of Spanish lampara = lampada, Neapolitan pere = Italian piede. Neap. rureci = duodecim, Italian mirolla = medulla, where we have the same d of medius. In Latin, not to speak of Ladinum and Larinum, where the priority of Ladinum may be disputed, we have in inscriptions Irus for Idus, Ferelez for Fidelis, both cited by Seelman (Die Aussprache des Latein, p. 311); maredus for madidus, Loewe, Prodromus, p. 353, and monerula for monedula in Captivi 999, and Asin. 694. Moreover, the kinship of r and d is distinctly recognized in Isidorus XII, 7, 69 merula antiquitus medula vocabatur eo quod moduletur, and in the equally absurd etymology of Servius Comm. on Aen. VIII, 138 Alii Mercurium quasi medicurrium a Latinis dictum volunt. - Isidorus alone supports the derivation from meri + die, while Cic. Or. 47, 157, Quintilian I, 6, 30, Nonius Marcellus, pp. 60, 451, Priscian IV, 34, Velius Longus K. VII, 71, follow Varro. 1 Printed in full in the American Journal of Philology, Vol. VII. pp. 228-231. xxxii</page><page sequence="33">Proceedings for Yuly, 1886. xxxiii As meri die was originally a locative, it was probably not for some time de- clined. Perhaps it was first used in the accusative after ante and post, and this led to the formation of a nom. There is some evidence to show that Plautus treated it as indeclinable in Most. 579, 582, and 65I, and in Pseud. II74.-In Terence it occurs but once, Adelph. 848, where Donatus says of meridie ipso, et nomen fecit de adverbio. A few instances were cited of the nom. meridies in Varro L. L. 6, 4; Caes. B. G. 7, 83; Censorinus, c. 24; Pliny, N; H. VII, 212, XVIII, 326; and in the Grammarians. Postmeridiem and antemeridiem are given as adverbs by Charisius, 187, 34, and Georges remarks that the Notae Tironianae, 74, give antemeridie and postmeridie. Some examples of postmeridie are also found in the MSS. of Vegetius. Remarks were made upon the paper by Professor B. I. Wheeler. 23. Phonetic Law, by Professor F. B. Tarbell, of Yale College, New Haven, Conn.; read, in the author's absence, by Mr. W. E. Waters. The Neo-Grammarian doctrine that phonetic laws admit of no exceptions ought to mean that every phonetic change is so related to certain elements in the pronunciation of the word or sentence, that wherever these elements or essential phonetic conditions occur, the said change unfailingly occurs, within the same dialect and the same period. In fact, however, all that is meant is that such a connexion obtains except where there is a sufficient reason for the contrary. Thus, although the subject of the mechanism and causation of phonetic changes is full of disputable questions, the bare principle of phonetic uniformity, when duly qualified and explained, sinks into a mere truism. 24. The Method of Phonetic Change in Language, by Professor William D. Whitney, Yale College, New Haven, Conn. To deduce empirically the laws of phonetic change in a given language or body of languages is one thing; to determine their underlying cause or causes is another and very different thing. The former calls for a wide and accurate knowledge of individual language facts, together with acuteness in their compari- son and combination, and with power of logical deduction; the latter requires in addition a true understanding of the nature of language, a thoroughly sound linguistic philosophy: and this is too often wanting, even among professed students of human speech. It is especially a misappreciation of the physical element in language, a treating of this as if it were the whole of language, that leads to false views and conclusions. Language, we are told, is a physical product; utterance is a physical event. That is true in just the same way and to the same extent of spoken language as of written language; not a jot more. The uttered word three, for example, is made by thie action of physical organs, communicated through a physical medium to other physical organs; but precisely the same thing is true of the written word three, or of its substitute, the sign 3. In so far, they are like the noise produced by a stone in rolling from a declivity, or the mark left by its track. But the difference is that, in the former case, each of the products is also a human act; it is something brought about by a human will, acting-through physical media, indeed, since capable of producing external</page><page sequence="34">American Philological Association. effects only by means of such - in a particular way for a particular purpose. It is a human act not less than is the making of a gesture, a clapping of the hands, the pulling of a bell, the working of a magneto-electric machine. The utterer has the intent to produce a certain audible sign, just as much as the writer a certain visible sign. It is the habit of both alike to produce that sign when they desire to signify a certain conception. Each habit was formed by them after the example of other utterers and writers, whom they imitated. It has been for some time the habit of a certain great community to make these signs for this particular conception, in order to a mutual understanding between person and person. No such sign has value except within the limits of a community, who agree in the habit of its use. The utterance is as meaningless to the ear of one who has not learned to associate the given meaning with it as the written or printed marks to the eye of one who has not learned to make and understand them. In other communities, other uttered and written signs, in immense variety, are used and made significant instead of these. No human being has any knowledge of how the utterance three came originally to be used for the purpose it serves; there are only conjectures about it, known to few, credited by fewer. The same is practically the case with the two written signs; what ground they are, with more or less uncertainty, believed to have is at any rate known to very few, and the ultimate element has nothing more necessary about it than a human habit. Since every other item of human speech is accordant in character with the one we have taken as illustration, it follows that any given language is a body of human habits, possessed and practised in common by a body of human beings. This is its essential nature. This is what needs to be considered when we come to discuss the modes and courses of its changes, of whatever kind. So far as concerns the written (or printed) sign three, or 3, no one would think of claiming that the series of alterations which have wrought the separate elements of the one out of their Phoenician originals (not to attempt to go further back), or of the other out of the three parallel strokes with which it doubtless started, were brought about otherwise than by the action of human wills, under inducements suited to each case, and capable of being at least in the main understood. Their present form is the result of a series of motivated changes of human habits. But precisely the same thing is true of the uttered sign three, in respect both to its form and to its meaning. A certain combination of sounds having once become current as representative of a certain sense, nothing can alter it in either particular save inducements addressed to the wills of its users. There can be no question here, as among things purely physical, of such a law as "like causes produce like effects "; because we have not to do with physical causes, but with causers, human beings, no one of whom is like any other, in any such manner and degree as should compel accordant action in changing the uttered signs of a language, or their meanings. If these principles in regard to language are well-founded -and their refuta- tion is confidently challenged - then the inquiry after the causes of phonetic change resolves itself into this: what inducements are of a nature to alter human habits, the common habits of a human community, in this particular kind? To put the inquiry in any form which is not either explicitly or implicitly this, is to fail of an answer or to insure a false answer. All physical facts, such as the xxxiv</page><page sequence="35">Proceedings for yuly, I886. position and movements, single or combined, of the organs of utterance, fall into their proper place as secondary causes, helping to determine the preferences of the utterers, having to be reckoned with as motives to the utterers' acts - deter- mining, in the rpain if not alone, the ways in which habits already formed shall give way in the direction of greater convenience. Since change of uttered form, like change of significance, consists in a modi- fication of habit on the part of a whole community, it can obviously take place only by degrees. There is no conceivable inducement that can move simul- taneously and uniformly all the members of the community. At any given time, while certain changes of recent origin have established themselves in general usage, there must be others which have only partially won acceptance, and yet others which are beginning to show themselves as candidates for acceptance. Even in the most homogeneous communities, the diversities of pronunciation are endless, appearing in minor localities, in classes, in groups, in individuals. There is not one of ourselves who does not have his private peculiarities of utterance - in such matters as the flattening of a, the shortening of o in home and whole and their like, the pronunciation of long u with or without the prefixed y-sound, the mode of production of the sibilants, and so on. Parallel with such diversities, and variously combined with them, are diversities in all the other departments of linguistic usage, as vocabulary, meaning, phrase-making, construction. Every secondary line of division in a community, whether of locality or of class or occu- pation, encloses a certain number of these diversities, and so is a line also of dialectic division, fainter or more distinct. Where there is no established literary dialect, to which all feel called upon to conform, the intricacy of overlapping and interlacing dialectic usage is extreme; and those who have to do with it are sometimes seduced into all sorts of unsound theories as to the facts and their relations and causes. As for those movements of phonetic change by which one sound of an alphabet undergoes general conversion into another sound, there is nothing to distinguish them in their causes and methods from the other alterations of speech. They, like the rest, are and can be only shifts of human habit under due inducement. They too are dialectic; they show themselves within the limits of a community, often of a subdivision of a former more extensive community, being unshared by other subdivisions, often of only a class in a community; they have spread so far as the channels of communication carry them, and no further. To introduce any element of necessity into such processes, like the necessities that connect cause and effect in the physical world, is a regrettable error. The "necessity" of a dialectic change in general lies simply in this: that a certain item of change is pretty sure, and is the surer according as its importance is greater and more con- spicuous, to become at last current throughout the whole body of a community. In like manner, the invariability of a given change of utterance of an alphabetic element, in the mouth of an individual and then of a community, means only that such a shift of pronunciation is pretty sure, and the surer according to its impor- tance and conspicuousness, to spread finally through the whole body of occur- rences of the element in question. But to set up the necessity and invariability of phonetic change as a fundamental rule seems equivalent to putting a dictum, a machtspruch, in the place of a demonstrated principle. XXXV</page><page sequence="36">American Philological Association. Professor March said:- That ther is a body of fonetic facts, the working forces in which can be defined scientifically, so as to be used for deduction and discovery, is manifest. That these forces ar human does not rule them out of science. The forces by which we see a world of three dimensions, act as regularly as the forces of growth; they act behind our purposes. So when alfabetic sounds change without culture1 the reason is found behind the motivs, such as the desire of communication, in a change of the concept which guides the vocal organs, or of the power that works them. These ar changed mainly by hebetude, perfervidness and new hearing. Hebetude: (i) concept and motiv unchanged, insufficient power is applied to work the organs, -the law of least effort; (2) a blurd, ill-formd concept is formd. Perfervidness in accent and pitch works strengthenings.2 New Hearing: the concept is changed. For exampl, when from movement of populations a new generation hears a different total of articulations from that heard by their parents, the concepts of the new generation wil be different. A main difference between fysical and psychical forces is, that atoms ar constant, while mind changes. Formulae for human action apply to defined persons and periods. Dialects afford natural segregations of persons and periods, for which fonetic forces may be taken as constant. To call the formulae for these forces laws is convenient, and opens the way for a good many convenient frases. Ther can be no great danger of misunderstanding it, at this time of day. The existence of fonetic laws, good for givn dialects, is thus affirmd. This implies a doctrin of resultants, Grimm's law and Verner's work for d in cweden. It implies the possibility of deductiv discovery. It implies a scientific doctrin of dialects. The affirmation that these laws hav no exceptions is a working hypothesis. It must be understood of the operation of powers, not of the appearance of fenomena. Insistence on this hypothesis has led to great results: to the rejection of a great number of plausibl etymologies, to the establishing a great number of obscure etymologies, to the extension of known changes into litl known fields, to the discovery of new laws, to the use of new caution and the attainment of greater precision in definition and reasoning. It has also led to a considerabl development of the doctrins of conformation and analogy. This has been the most interesting part of the new movement to the great body of workers. The establishment of formulae for the working of the laws of association in language by induction from changes in words is a fascinating work, and may lead to laws as good as the best " fonetic laws." As to absolute inviolability as a matter of fact, it may be further said, that the working hypothesis affirms it only for establisht dialects, not for periods of forma- tion or decay. The possibility of personal intervention is also reservd in all laws of human action. A man may spel or speak queerly for whim or sport. Such interventions ar like miracls in nature, set aside as anecdotes, and not included in the materials for science. And we should not be very redy to believ that a fenomenon is caused in that way. To defend the inviolability of these fonetic laws as a fact of induction is inept. It has led to hedging and defining law and dialect til all the practical force of the working hypothesis is taken out of it. 1 For cultured changes, see Proceedings for I884, pp. xxxv+. 2 See Transactions for I877, pp. I47+. xxxvi</page><page sequence="37">Proceedings for yuly, 1886. The following papers were read only by title:- 25. Horace vs. his Scholiast (De Arte Poet. I75, 176), by Pro- fessor Lemuel S. Potwin, Adelbert College, Cleveland, Ohio. Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum, multa recedentes adimunt. The interpretation of this passage seems to have suffered from undue defer- ence to the Scholiasts. See particularly Orelli (I844) and Schiitz (1882). The opinions of the Scholiasts are, of course, valuable - sometimes even for their gar- rulousness; but if we must choose between them and Horace, give us Horace by all means. In this case they seem determined to rob the poet both of his origi- nality and his Latinity; his originality by implying that in characterizing the years he merely uses a common epithet; his Latinity by implying that venientes is used adjectively, instead of being a strict participle. It was no new thought that youth brings commoda, and that old age takes them away. It was not new to use anni as equivalent to senectus. Horace him- self says:- Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes. Ep. II. 2, 55. The new turn of expression seems to have been to make anni represent both youth and age, the years coming with their burden of good, as well as going with their burden of stolen treasures. 26. Munda, by Professor William I. Knapp, of Yale College, New Haven, Conn. The paper discussed the location of Munda in Hispania Antiqua, involving an outline of the civil war carried to that country after the African campaign; the progress of Caesar and Gn. Pompey from Corduba and Attegua to Hispalis and the plains of Munda, with a description of the conditions of that plain as suggested by the ancient writers, especially by Hirtius; the situation of the fortress on one of a series of hills stretching from below Hispalis to Gades; the marshes that ran to the south and west towards the town of Nebrissa and the Baetis,- marshes still called in the native patois bujeros, i. e. agujeros, 'holes'; the time required to reach it from Attegua, near Corduba (Teba la Vieja, Old Teba) compared with the account of Hirtius and the early itineraries; its rela- tion to Carteia (Melcarteia or Heraclea); mediaeval journeys by the same route; the names of places according to the Arabian geographer Edrisi; the impossi- bility of all the locations cited at the present day for such a battle, requiring a plain five miles in extent, running along a range of hills, and spreading out in front of one of them. Surely this is not the case with Ronda, Monda, or any other place between Corduba and Malaga, as the writer knows by personal exami- nation, and does tally in every respect with the plains and hills near Nebrija or Lebrija. That the true site is near the still marshy and now malarious plain by Nebrissa, on the old highway, from Seville to Medina Sidonia and Xerez. The particular bluff or cerro (cirrus) is now called Gibalbin, but Edrisi (Dozy's ed.) gives it as Gibal-mint or munt, the Hill of Munt or Mont. It was shown that Mint is by softening of the vowel dhamma into kesra through Spanish influences likefrente fromfronte-m through the old form fruente, - Munda, Muenda. Menda, - and that this is indeed Gibal Munda, the Hill Munda. The arroyo that cut the plain in Caesar's time is still there, and is now called Romanina, the Roman tussle, xxxvii</page><page sequence="38">American Philological Association. according to the usaal force of the Spanish ending -ina when attached to proper names--la Sarracina. The jasper stones found there, as mentioned by Pliny, are still abundant at Gibalbin, and the old Latin epithets applied to the surround- ing towns connected with some triumph of Caesar are found only here, not between C6rdova or Seville and Malaga: Nebrissa Veneria (Venus, Caesar's favorite deity); Asta Regia, in honor of the African King Bogud, who turned the tide of victory by attacking the rear of Labienus, where the impedimenta were; Iulia Gaditana, Iulia Traducta, Asido Caesariana, Castrum Iulium, or Cas- trum Caesaris Salutariensis, "the salvation of Caesar," applied to Urgia. 27. Aristophanes and-Low Comedy, by Alfred Emerson, Ph.D., of Milford, Neb. The critical principle of Aristarchos, " Homerum ex Homero," has not been sufficiently followed out in the case of Aristophanes. No attempt has been made to collect and classify the passages which express his views of stage proprieties and the dramatic art, somewhat as Hamlet's advice to the players expresses Shakespeare's. Yet the number of such passages in Aristophanes is so large, owing to the unparallelled degree of direct intercourse between author and audience that obtained in the Old Attic Comedy, that a very clear perception of the poet's conscious comic ideal may be gained from this source. The collection and classification of these passages is the necessary preliminary to such a dissec- tion of the eleven extant plays and the fragments of the twenty-nine lost ones, as shall determine how much or how little coincidence can be traced between the playwright's principles and his practice. It will be found, on examination, that every passage of this nature to be found in Aristophanes bears on the distinction it pleased that writer to draw between high and low comedy, the vulgar manner which was that of certain among his predecessors and rivals, and the grand style which is his own. It is only when his pertinent utterances are studied collectively, however, that the comprehensive- ness of the two cardinal categories becomes evident. The common designation of all that serves as a foil to his own manner, with Aristophanes, is pJpTros, it PfopTiKcj KwzwiLa (e.g. Pax 748, Plutus 796, Vespae 66). The farcical writers are &amp;vspeS (popTIKOL, or o' Tpvyoaail.oves oTroL (Nubes 296, 524). Phrynichos, Lykis, and Ameipsias were signal examples of the class (Ranae 13, 14). Phrynichos was the patron saint of the indecent dance kordax (Vespae 1490); from him Eupolis stole this feature, together with the old woman that introduced it in his Marikas (Nubes 553-556). Ameipsias is again branded as an av)p )popTifcds in the Clouds, in company with the great Kratinos, who, galled by taunts in the Knights, had aroused himself to administer a signal defeat to the Clouds on its first performance (Clouds, Argument V.). If it seem a puzzle that the author's two greatest contemporaries should come under this stigma, it must be remembered that flings of this sort were distributed on the comic stage with little regard to truth, and also that Aristophanes frequently checks his own characters, humorously, from disgracing him with outbreaks the like of which are allowed to pass unchallenged elsewhere. Actually, some allu- sions to things characterized as inadmissible on the ground of pertaining to the poprTI^I7c KWrofIwa would be unintelligible but for the excellent examples in illustra- tion furnished by the comedies of the author himself. One can only be amused xxxviii</page><page sequence="39">Proceedings for July, i886. xxxix at Kock's taking this inconsistent genius seriously (see the notes to the prologue of the Frogs, in his edition of the play). The scattered references may be classified as follows: - I. Plain statements of what is right and wrong in drama and comedy. E.g. What is wrong should be hid by an author. He should not by any means drag into light or put on the boards what is wicked; For teachers of children are all who explain, while poets are teachers of grown folk. And hence we are bound to tell only the good. - Ranae Io53-1058. For it is not meet in the author of a play To throw to his spectators figs and sweets, Making them laugh at this. - Plutus 797-99. 2. Self-glorifications. E.g. His play comes on the stage, not with all manner of farcical tricks, but Reliant on itself alone and what it may have said, And yet a poet such as I keeps still his level head, And never,seeks to swindle you rehashing twice and thrice; For every play that I produce brings something new and nice. - Nubes 544-8. 3. Censure of predecessors and rivals. In this, praise of himself is always implied, often expressed, whether he alludes to the wretchedly careless mounting of early comedy in the Danaids: - 6 Xopb; 8' "wpXe'" av evailcAevov r4iTSaS Kau crptOjlT6aoSeua, Sta,aaXaXiocras avrbv X;eCiOrv aI Kd nraKaLu Kai paaaviacv.- Fr. 253 (Kock). Owrwos abvTOs aTraXaLpTr(oposC IroirOo1 LiKeLeTO. - Fr. 254. or accuses a contemporary of plagiarism in the Eupolidean verse: - eK 6e ri 1? eXAy xXavi6os TpeiZ arAryia; &amp;Toriov. - Fr. 54. 4. Commendation of kindred spirits. E.g. Again he remembers Kratinos, whose flow in the pride of his praise Came down as a flood on the valley, uptearing the trees from their base, And bearing his foes with the oaks and the poplars adrift on its face. - Eq. 526-8. His praise, indeed, has sometimes an ironical or patronizing cast, whether Magnes is celebrated for the abundance of his resources in operatic stagecraft (Equites 520-525), or Krates for his cheap wit (Equites 537-539 and Fr. 333 from Thesmoph. II.; compare Fr. 29 of Krates himself). Aristophanes defines the office of the poet as that of a popular teacher (Ranae 1oo8-o098). His ideal is the o7rov8sa6riTs of Aristotle, the high seriousness of Matthew Arnold. The verse - avayKr)' f.eydA)ov yvWo,uJv KaL LavoLiv oaa IcaL, T p11jqaTa Tticrev. - Ranae o058-9. seems a condensation of Arnold's thought.l Even the physical degeneracy of the jeunesse doree of Athens is traced to the influence of bad poetry (Ranae 1076- 1098; comp. Nubes I002-1014: 1015-1023). The doctrine of Aristophanes, his 1 " The superior character of truth and seriousness, in the matter and substance of the best poetry, is inseparable from the superiority of diction and movement marking its style and manner. The two superiorities are closely related, and are in steadfast proportion one to the other." - Matthew Arnold, in his Introduction to Ward's English Poets,</page><page sequence="40">American Philological Association. policy, is best set forth in the parabasis proper of the Acharnians (vv. 628-653). Numerous lines characterize his manner of promulgating it. The principal pas- sages are Ach. 300, 301, 659-664; Vesp. 1029-1059, 1284-1291; Pax 748-752 and 752-759 = Vcsp. I030-1036; Ran. 354-358. But the claim advanced is based mainly on his pretended freedom from the tricks of the farcical playwrights whose chief method of provoking laughter was the constant and wearisome employment of stock scenes and properties, such as rags and lice, slaves who cheat their masters, and are chased and beaten, then brought in blubbering to serve as butts for wrought jokes, the Epicharmian figure of Herakles gorging himself and wagging his ears, or ravenously hungry (Pax 738-747); such as ridicule of the poor Megarians, the scattering of nuts among the audience by a brace of slaves, Herakles choused of his dinner, endless repe- titions of one satirical attack (Vesp. 54-66; comp. Plut. 789-796); such as slaves grumbling under their load with forbidden words and inarticulate sounds (Ran. I-I8); such as poor jokes, beatings, hideous howls, torches, the survival of the old-time phallos, obscene dances, and fun poked at the baldheads (Nubes 537-544). The condemnation of torches here and in Lysistr. 1216-1221 is rendered intelligible only by the laughable buffoonery of an Aristophanic scene, the singe- ing of Mnesilochos in the Thesmophoriazusae (236-248). It would be easy, in a similar fashion, to cull illustrations of each mentioned feature of low comedy from Aristophanes; but that his reputation was not dependent on these matters of "stage business," is proved by his readableness. Hence he could truly say:-- A\6y? yap i y wo v t 6 . e rO0', epyoto- 8' oi. - Fr. 529 (Bergk's reading). The report of the Committee to nominate Officers for the ensuing year was presented by Professor F. A. March. In accordance with the recommendations of the Committee, the officers for I886-87 were elected as follows: President, Professor A. C. Merriam, Columbia College, New York, N. Y. Vice-Presidents, Professor Isaac H. Hall, New York, N. Y., and Professor T. D. Seymour, Yale College, New Haven, Conn. Secretary, Professor John H. Wright, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. Treasurer, Professor John H. Wright. Additional members of the Executive Committee,- Professor Basil L. Gildersleeve, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. Professor Charles R. Lanman, Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass. Professor Francis A. March, Lafayette College, Easton, Penn. Professor Bernadotte Perrin, Adelbert College, Cleveland, Ohio. Professor William D. Whitney, Yale College, New Haven, Conn. The Committee on time and place of next meeting, through Pro- fessor W. D. Whitney, recommended that the Association should next meet at Burlington, Vt., on Tuesday, July 12, 1887, unless otherwise ordered by the Executive Committee. The report was accepted, and the recommendations adopted. xl</page><page sequence="41">Proceedings for /uly, I886. Mr. C. J. Buckingham reported, on behalf of the Auditing Com- mittee, that the Treasurer's accounts had been examined and found correct. The report was accepted. Professor March, as Chairman of the Committee on the Reform of English Spelling, presented an alfabetical list of words to which the joint rules apply which wer recommended by the Association and the Philological Society of London in I883. The Committee think such a list wil be useful. There is new interest in the reform among the teachers of English in Germany, France, and Denmark. A society of them has been formd with hedquarters at Paris, and they issue a monthly " Fonetik Titcer." On motion the report was accepted, and the Committee appointed in I875 was continued for another year. It now consists of Messrs. March (chairman), W. F. Alien, Child, Lounsbury, Price, Trumbull, and Whitney. On motion a resolution was adopted as follows:- The American Philological Association desires to express, to the Trustees and Faculty of Cornell University, its hearty thanks for the use of the Botanical Lec- ture Room as the place of meeting, for entertainment in Sage College, for kind attention in giving the members access to the buildings and various collections of Cornell University; further, to acknowledge its grateful appreciation of the liberality of the citizens of Ithaca who provided the pleasant excursion on Lake Cayuga, and of the courtesy and hospitality of which the members of the Associa- tion were the recipients at Aurora, and in particular at Wells College. A communication from Professor Albert S. Cook, of the University of California, dated Oxford, England, June 25, I887, presenting the claims upon Americans of the great English dictionary now issuing, under the editorship of Dr. J. A. H. Murray, was referred to the Executive Committee, with powers. The Association then adjourned. xli</page><page sequence="42">OFFICERS OF THE ASSOCIATION. 1886-87. PRESIDENT. AUGUSTUS C. MERRIAM.

The Proceedings of the American Philological Association are distributed gratis upon application until they are out of print.

The price of these volumes is $2.00 apiece, except Volume XV., for which $2.50 is charged. The first two volumes will not be sold separately. REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF COMPLETE SETS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. Single COMPLETE SETS of the Transactions (Volumes I.-XVII.) will be sold to public libraries, until further notice, at twenty-five dollars a set. It is especially appropriate that American Libraries should exert themselves to procure this series while it may be had. It is the work of American scholars, and contains many valuable articles not elsewhere accessible; and, aside from these facts, as the first collection of essays in general philology made in this country, it is sure to be permanently valuable for the history of American scholarship. lx</page></plain_text>
