Contemporary man threw himself into the experi- ence of these new relationships. But saturated with old ideologies, he approached the new dimension with obsolete practices and failed to translate his newly gained experience into emotional language and cultural reality. The result has been and still is misery and conflict, brutality and anguish, unem- ployment and war. . . . The problem of our genera- tion is to bring the intellectual and emotional, the social and the technological components into bal- anced play; to learn to see and feel them in rela- tionship. Without this ¡nter-relatedness there remains only the disjunctive technical skill of handling human affairs, a rigidity stifling biological and social impulses; a memorized not a lived life."1 So wrote László Moholy-Nagy, describing the modern era whose apogee came between the two World Wars. Upheaval, experimentation, and the search for new beliefs characterized this period of modernism, which was imbued with a faith in progress and in the beauty and poetry of every- day things and events. During this time the interplay between art and photography bridged the gap between art and life that had been fostered by the alienating individualism of the Romantic era. Photography, revitalized, spurned old and tired traditions and embraced progress and technology. In Europe, where the hierarchy of high and low art was being chal- lenged, photography became the perfect vehicle for the disso- lution of boundaries. Moholy-Nagy and Lucia Moholy wrote of this in their seminal article Production/Reproduction (1922), while Walter Benjamin addressed these issues in his classic essay Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1936). These artists and critics sought to revolutionize art and culture through the use of reproducible media such as photography, film, and graphic design. The period after World War I was a time of exuberance, upheaval, renewal, and disposal; a period in which Utopian plans were made, and social and political unrest were com- mon. In Germany, the monarchy shattered; the Weimar Republic was founded with Berlin as its capital. Berlin rapid- ly became a center for innovative arts. In France, Paris was a mecca for artists, writers, entertainers, and musicians who took advantage of the liberty and nonconformity of the artist quartiers, like Montparnasse. Czechoslovakia, too, experi- enced a cultural explosion after the fall of the Austro- Hungarian empire, serving as a center for photography, film, and creative discourse. Social, philosophical, psychological, and technological inno- vations originating in the nineteenth century set the stage for a modern era and influenced the direction of artistic expres- sion in the early twentieth century. In the mid-nineteenth cen- tury, Karl Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed God to be dead, while Karl Marx blamed capitalism for a societal demise. Sigmund Freud's articulation of the concept of the uncon- scious had a profound effect on society and later became a cornerstone of Surrealism. In the twentieth century, abstrac- tion upended traditional representation, while the Dada movement mocked high art with absurd collages and elevat- ed everyday objects to the status of art. Suprematism and Constructivism embraced the spirit of a modern technological era in Russia, while the French Surrealists explored the inner workings of the mind. The structure of the innovative musical compositions of Arnold Schönberg and Igor Stravinsky paral- leled visual departures, and Kurt Weill and Berthold Brecht's The Threepenny Opera represented the Zeitgeist of post- World War I Germany. Films such as Robert Weine's Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919) and Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1926), along with the works of Russian filmmakers like Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov, were influencing photog- raphers with their original visual techniques. The population explosion and increased urbanization were factors that influenced architecture and design after World War I. In Germany the Bauhaus produced a new system of architecture, which included standardization, préfabrication, the use of steel, concrete, and glass, and the melding of form with function. This was the machine age where stream- lined designs rejected nature as a referent, and plastics, machine-manufactured goods, and new modes of transporta- tion played prominent roles. Photography suited this new sensibility because it was considered a mechanical process. Accessible and infinitely duplicable, photographs under- mined the concept of the precious and the singular. At the same time, however, there existed an anxiety that resulted from the technological era. Characterized by a metaphysical uncertainty fueled by the disenfranchising power of the mechanical world, photography and film became the ideal tools with which to celebrate or criticize these aspects of modern life and to investigate new ways of seeing. In the period between the wars, the cross-fertilization among diverse media and ideologies led to the creation of some of 2</page><page sequence="5">the most visually exciting images made to date. Often pho- tography was not the exclusive medium through which artists expressed themselves. Collage and montage were also vehi- cles for critique and fantasy, and painters, sculptors, and designers used their knowledge of these media to impart unique interpretations to photographic subjects. Meanwhile, "straight" photographers found their artistic statements in the real world. Unmanipulated photography followed two paths of investigation: the camera was used as a mechanical instrument to render the subject in a realistic manner, or as a medium with which to explore new optical experiences, thereby characterizing the modern world. There was often more interest in the idea and the process than in the final product. In the years after World War I, photography broke free from exhausted traditions. During the latter part of the nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century, photography centered on Pictorialism, sentimental genre imagery, or pic- turesque landscape photography that held mass appeal. In "artistic" photography, Pictorialism remained a mainstay of the salons and camera annuals well into the late 1920s. However, more and more, photographers were discovering new and exciting viewpoints related to the experimentation with optical vision. Dubbed the "New Vision" by Moholy- Nagy, aspects of the new aesthetic began to be featured in magazines, camera annuals, and exhibitions. In this time of transition, photography moved from Pictorialism, which delib- erately concealed its technological foundations, to the New Vision aesthetic, which celebrated optical seeing. Previously, Pictorialist photography had relied on numerous painterly techniques, such as bromoil and gum-bichromate printing, to mimic the effect of painting or drawing. But as early as 1917, the Pictorialist photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn reacted to the paintings of the Cubists by producing a series of abstracted ¡mages that were made with a kaleidoscopic device through which light was refracted (Figure 1). The New Vision aesthetic was very consciously self-referen- tial and employed compositional devices that transformed the familiar into the ambiguous. Utilizing extreme perspec- tives, fragmentation, tilted horizons, limited depth of field, and such experimental techniques as multiple printing, solar- ization, negative/positive printing, and camera-less photog- raphy (the photogram), photographers created a visual expression that was now linked with the modern world. Experimentation and playfulness characterized its vanguard voice. The beginnings of the New Vision, however, can be traced back to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when painters like Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edouard Manet, Pierre Bonnard, and Paul Cézanne were presenting a "new vision" in their paintings.

Burke 106:1985 Courtesy George Eastman House The first photography exhibitions to bring together the new aesthetic were: Neue Wege der Fotografie (1928); Premier Solon Independent de lo Photographie (1928); Fotografie der Gegenwart (1929); and the international Film und Foto exhibition (1929). Melding art, commerce, science, and industry, Film und Foto provided a forum for a diverse group of photographers from seven countries. Considered one of the most influential of the New Vision exhibitions, Film und Foto gathered ¡mages from a variety of sources, including newspapers, scientific journals, popular periodicals, and news agencies as well as from individual artists whose works represented disparate ideologies. Dada, Surrealism, the Bauhaus, the New Objectivity, post-revolutionary Russia, and the American contingent of "straight" photographers were all represented. Altogether approximately 1 18 photographers and institutions participated. Avant-garde photography flourished throughout Europe in the years between the wars, particularly in Germany where pho- tographers made some of their most significant break- throughs between the fall of Kaiser Wilhelm and the rise of Adolf Hitler. The establishment of the Weimar Republic in 1919 brought relative stability to Germany after years of domestic and economic unrest, and the years from 1919 to 1933 became a time of exploration and change. Interest in photography helped support a number of innovative German art schools that provided photographic instruction, of which the Bauhaus was one. Parallel to the development of experimental photography was an interest in the objective, realistic depiction of a sub- ject. Photographers embraced by proponents of the New Objectivity movement in painting included August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt (Figure 2), Werner Mantz, and Albert Renger- Patzsch. The direct approach to the subject was most often used by commercial photographers for object photography, but portraitists like August Sander also adopted it in reaction to the tired traditions of the portrait studio aesthetic. 3</page><page sequence="6">PHOTOGRAPHY IN MODERN EUROPE Paris, like Berlin, boasted a cosmopolitan culture that encour- aged the artistic community to represent and celebrate the spirit of modern life. The two most important movements to employ photography in Paris during this time were Dada and Surrealism. Photography was assimilated by the Dadaists through their use of found imagery in collages and montages. These "anti-artists" sought to counter the social detachment of previous movements, such as Expressionism and Cubism. The Surrealists used photography for its ability to imitate reality. Salvador Dalí wrote in 1928, "Nothing is more suited to recreate the exchange that transpires between reality and sur- reality than photography."2 Tricks of surreal contradiction were played out by the artists who exploited photography's seeming veracity. Double exposures, negative printing, solar- izations, and photograms were all techniques that broke the barrier of the representation of the real world and extended the imagery into a fantasy world. Czechoslovakia and Russia also contributed to the develop- ment of a new photography in Europe. After its liberation from the feudalism of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Czechoslovakia was a hotbed of artistic and cultural talent. Utilizing aspects of Surrealism, Functionalism (the Bauhaus aesthetic), and Russian Constructivism, Czech artists devel- oped a distinct body of work in photography and film. Jaromir Funke, Adolph Schneeberger, Karel Teige, Jaroslav Rössler, and Joseph Sudek developed singular visions in pho- tography that have influenced subsequent modernist photogra- phers both in Europe and in the United States. Russia built its own photographic vision, advanced by Alexander Rodchenko and El Lissitzky, whose ideas quickly spread throughout Europe, finding their way into the Bauhaus aesthetic through Moholy-Nagy. Throughout Europe, photography expanded the visual lan- guage of advertising and journalism. In France, Man Ray and Maurice Tabard used their Surrealist vision to construct images for fashion magazines, while in Germany, Herbert Bayer utilized the geometric compositions of Russian Constructivism in his graphic designs and photography. In Holland, Piet Zwart advanced the commercial applications of the medium by utilizing what he had learned from Constructivism and De Stijl to bring typography and ¡mages together in innovative visual combinations. Journalism benefited most from technological advancements. The development of more sensitive emulsions, roll film, and smaller cameras all facilitated the depiction of spontaneous activity. Photographers, often coming from other professions, Figure 2 Karl Blossfeldt German, 1865-1932 Silphium lociniatum from Urformen der Kunst, 1928 photogravure The Saint Louis Art Museum Martin Schweig Memorial Fund for Photography 181:1993 began to see the benefits of these developments and chan- neled their energies into documenting events for the news media. Throughout the late 1920s until the advent of televi- sion, the picture press was at the forefront in the dissemina- tion of critical information. In journalism and reportage, aes- thetic concepts of the New Vision began to appear in print. Unusual camera angles and collage or montage - as well as cropping, captions, and dynamic layouts - were designed to appeal to an increasingly cosmopolitan readership. The van- guard picture press included periodicals like the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung, Münchner Illustrierte Presse, The Illustrated London News, Picture Post, Paris Moderne, and Vu, which were the equivalents to the American periodicals Life, Look, Fortune, and Harper's. The new "reportage," which human- ized news stories with in-depth and sensitive depictions of the issues at hand, was championed by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Felix H. Man among others. After World War I, photography became a tool with which women could express themselves and make important contri- butions to artistic discourse. The new woman - who worked, voted, smoked, and enjoyed greater sexual freedom - lived an independent lifestyle in the inter-war years. Florence Henri, Lucia Moholy, Lotte Jacobi, and Ringl and Pit (Ellen Auerbach and Grete Stern) were some of the artists who ben- efited from the increased social and economic independence. Photography, while still a male dominated field, was never- theless taken up by many women who recognized in it expressive and economic potential. Reportage, industrial doc- umentation, portraiture, abstraction, and experimentation pro- vided an avenue for the establishment of a sense of self for women photographers. 4</page><page sequence="7">In the years before World War II, the rise of the National Sozialisten (Nazi party) had already curtailed the feverish excitement and innovation in the arts. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, many of Europe's best artists emigrated to England, the United States, or other countries outside of its reach of terror. Ellen Auerbach, Grete Stern, Lotte Jacobi, Lucia Moholy, László Moholy-Nagy, Herbert Bayer, Lisette Model, André Kertész, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Grit Kallin- Fischer, and Walter Peterhans were some of the artists who left their homeland before 1945. Those artists who did stay faced persecution, arrest, and sometimes death. Often the photographers who fled lost many of their pictures through bombings and confiscation. What survives is a rare selection of ¡mages that describe in articulate detail the Zeitgeist of modern Europe. However, the contribution is not merely of historic value, for the aesthetic principles developed during the inter-war years have provided the foundation for today's photographic activity. The photographs included in this publication are characteris- tic of the experimentation of the vibrant period in Europe between the wars. They were chosen to represent a range of important artistic and social movements, including Surrealism and Functionalism (the Bauhaus or International Style), as well as developments in photojournalism and commercial photography. These artists examined both traditional and nontraditional themes, creating exciting new visual state- ments in areas such as portraiture, the nude, abstraction, photomontage, and documentary and street photography. Through the expertise of this museum's curators and the sup- port of its directors over the years, the photography collec- tion of the Saint Louis Art Museum has grown to represent the diversity of the medium in general, and to complement the museum's fine collection of modern paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings. Acknowledgments I would like to thank Barbara Butts, Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs at the museum, for her patience, encouragement, and valuable critique of the text. I am also grateful to David Travis, Curator of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago, for his scholarly advice on the project. Thanks are extended to the museum's director James D. Burke and associate director Sidney Goldstein for the opportunity to write the publication.

Therefore let me speak the truth in all honesty about our age and the people of our age."1 - August Sander Born into a farming and mining family in Herdorf, Germany, August Sander was apprenticed to the mines as a youth. He was first exposed to photography when he was chosen at random to be a guide for a photographer working on the landscape around the mine. Sander's family supported his new interest by building him a darkroom, while an uncle supplied him with a camera. After working as a freelance photographer on architectural and industrial projects, Sander accepted the position of "first operator" in a portrait studio in Linz, Austria. There he established himself as an "art pho- tographer," paying homage to Rembrandt by prominently hanging a self-portrait of the master in the studio and work- ing in the Pictorialist style. In 1909, Sander returned to Germany, where he eventually established another indepen- dent portrait studio in Cologne. Sander's return to Germany brought him closer to his roots, and although pictorialist pretenses brought him financial suc- cess, his heart lay with the simple depiction of people. In the early years of the twentieth century, Sander's ideas coa- lesced. It was from Cologne that he began his first indepen- dent portrait project, intended as a serious body of work that would express an element of "truth" not found in the studio. He commuted by bicycle to the neighboring town of Westerwald for his portrait commissions, photographing farmers and craftspeople whose living conditions recalled those of pre-industrial Europe. In Cologne, Sander frequently hosted gatherings with artists who were members of the New Objectivity movement. Sander's direct and unpretentious portraits fit well into their aesthetic and were embraced with enthusiasm. By 1922, Sander had abandoned "art photography," preferring to print on sharp glossy paper. His interpretation of the ¡mages also took on new life. The photographs that Sander had pre- viously felt were made as "works of art," began to take on a documentary status for him. Sander's idea for the Citizens of the Twentieth Century pro- ject, from which the ¡mage Secretary at a Radio Station orig- inates, was germinated in the year 1910. Relying on the direct observation of human nature rather than on scientific or social theory, Sander sought to render a truthful and sin- cere portrait of society without prejudice for any group in the social structure. Sander's monumental body of work, Citizens of the Twentieth Century, was conceived to take the form of 45 portfolios, each with 1 2 photographs that depicted a cross section of the German population, including farmers and crafts people, urban professionals, and marginalized or displaced people. These portfolios would be offered by subscription after a pre- view of 60 ¡mages was published as the book Antlitz der Zeit (Face of the Time) in 1929. However, the project was never realized in its entirety. Portfolio III of the Citizens of the Twentieth Century project was to include a section depicting women, and Secretary at a Radio Station is an ¡mage in the "working woman" sub- group. In this series, Sander includes a typist, housewife, dance teacher, painter, real estate dealer, nurse, and a milliner. It is of note that Sander considered a housewife to be a "working woman," an attitude which only recently has been reawakened since the 1 950s postwar culture relegated the woman to the home. A print made from the original glass-plate negative by Sander's son, Günther, Secretary at a Radio Station represents women who were gaining both social and economic independence during the years of the Weimar Republic. The sitter in this photograph seems self- assured as she smokes a cigarette and wears the latest fash- ions. The analytical depth of Sander's project made it one of the most significant social and scientific documents of the twentieth century.

Museum Shop Fund 36:1985 Photographer, writer, and historian, Lucia Moholy studied philosophy, art history, and English in Prague. In 1914 she moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, where she wrote theater reviews for a newspaper. In the next few years, she held a number of positions at publishing houses before meeting László Moholy-Nagy in Berlin in 1920. After they married, Moholy supported both herself and her husband with her editorial work until he was offered a position at the Bauhaus in Weimar. Moholy was instrumental in disseminating her husband's ideas through the translation of his writings into German. She was fluent in Czechoslovakia^ German, and English and had a working knowledge of French, Spanish, and Turkish.1 She also collaborated with him to produce his now famous photograms. It was Moholy who spent time in the darkroom, developing, printing, and copying her husband's work. She provided the translation and commentary on her husband's many theoretical treatises from the time of his classic article Production/Reproduction; however, by her own admission, she only helped facilitate Moholy-Nagy's ideas and image- making and did not actively take part in their creation. In addition to the work she did for her husband, Moholy was actively engaged as a record photographer at the Bauhaus. While documenting architecture and objects from the famous school, Moholy honed her knowledge of photog- raphy. To refine her technical skills, she studied at the Akademie für Graphische Künste und Buchgewerbe in Leipzig, where Walter Peterhans also studied. From 1925, she made photographs of the new Bauhaus buildings in Dessau; these ¡mages were used to illustrate articles in archi- tectural publications. Moholy's strongest independent work, however, was in por- traiture. Photographing artists, architects, and photographers, she often moved close to her subjects, creating monumental yet intimate portraits. It is evident from the catalogue of extant portraits that she experimented a great deal with viewpoint. Moving around the subject with a large-format plate camera, she started with a frontal portrait, then moved to a profile shot, and added oblique views from below or above as well as three-quarter views. Moholy was an objective photograph- er who brought out the sculptural qualities of her subjects. She was once quoted as saying, "I photograph people like archi- tecture."2 Particularly relevant to this statement is Moholy's portrait of the critic, art historian, and New Vision photogra- pher Franz Roh, who was an organizer of the landmark exhi- bition Film und Foto. Roh is rendered as an architectonic vis- age, contemplative and intimate. Seldom are Moholy's por- traits romantic or flattering in the traditional sense, yet the closeness with which she captures her subjects surely reveals her benign relationship with the sitters. After her separation from Moholy-Nagy in 1929, Moholy taught at the Johannes-ltten-Schule in Berlin. Johannes Itten, who left the Bauhaus in 1923, was one of its most important and revered founding teachers. In the same year, Moholy's work was included in the important Deutsche Werkbund Film und Foto exhibition. With the rise of the Nazi party in Germany in the 1930s, Moholy emigrated to London via Prague, Vienna, and Paris. Arriving in London in 1933, she taught at the London School of Printing. In 1939 she pub- lished A Hundred Years of Photography, a cultural history of the medium which had been inspired by the Film und Foto exhibition ten years earlier. She continued to pursue photog- raphy, working as an archivist for the University of Cambridge Library and filming the cultural heritage of Middle Eastern countries for the newly founded UNESCO. Like many of her colleagues, Moholy lost most of her nega- tives and prints during the war. Her early contribution to the history of the medium went unrecognized for many years, as did the works of a number of her female contemporaries, including Florence Henri. Only with renewed interest in women's issues in the 1970s did the work reemerge. Signed and dated verso in black marker, l.r.: Lucia Moholy Inscribed verso in graphite, I.I.: 56.

Funds given in honor of Bess Horwitz by her children 135:1982 Lotte Jacobi was a fourth-generation photographer whose great-grandfather, Samuel Jacobi, studied photography with Jacques-Louis-Mandé Daguerre, one of the inventors of the medium. At the early age of thirteen, she had already begged her father for a camera of her own. The Jacobi stu- dio was a family business and, in the late 1 920s, it flour- ished with the help of Jacobi's mother, whose many friends and relatives helped bolster business. Her father was respon- sible for most of the studio portraits, while her sister produced table-top and fashion photographs. Jacobi was a specialist in portraits; however, her oeuvre also extended to theater stills, street and travel photography, and light abstractions. In 1 927 she completed her studies in photography at the Staatliche Höhere Fach-Schule für Phototechnik. After a failed marriage had left her independent, she began work in the family stu- dio. Jacobi is one of many women who made photography their career after gaining economic, social, and political inde- pendence in the years following the First World War. One of Jacobi's signature ¡mages, Lotte Lenya, was captured backstage during a break from the play The Threepenny Opera in 1928. The actress's tired, sad eyes and ¡aunty cig- arette contribute an intimacy and personality to the ¡mage, making ¡t unlike most publicity photographs. Although Lotte Lenya was a friend of Jacobi's, the artist only made one por- trait of her. According to historian Cornell Capa, this photo- graph was the actress's favorite ¡mage of herself, and a few months before her death she asked Jacobi to re-photograph her. Lenya died before they could get together.1 Jacobi preferred to work on location and in natural light, waiting for just the right moment to press the shutter on her large-format camera. Her use of natural light (rather than stu- dio light), slow shutter speeds, and limited depth of field often softened the faces of her sitters, an effect that became Figure 3 Lotte Jacobi Head of a Dancer, Berlin (Niura Norskaya), c. 1929 (printed later) gelatin silver print The Saint Louis Art Museum Funds given in honor of Bess Horwitz by her children 136:1982 her trademark. Her portraits could be considered "environ- mental," that is to say they include a measure of their sur- roundings, adding atmosphere or personality. She never imposed her own "design" on her compositions - in fact, it seems that many of her ¡mages are almost anti-posed. These images retain a sense of spontaneity that is not usually found in formal portraiture. The portraits of Lotte Lenya and the dancer Niura Norskaya (Figure 3) are two of Jacobi's most stylized compositions. In these portraits, she lets herself be led by the personal manner of her sitter. Jacobi's story is one that many of the photographers in this publication share. Leaving Germany in 1 935 to escape the Nazi threat, she emigrated to the United States via London. In New York, she opened a studio with her sister and quickly became a celebrity. Almost immediately, a group of pho- tographs was published in a Sunday feature of the Herald Tribune. Like many photographers and artists leaving Europe during this turbulent time, Jacobi lost much of her work; only a few of her negatives survived. Jacobi photographed some of the most noteworthy personali- ties in modern history. The list of sitters during the scope of her career is formidable: Albert Einstein, Pablo Casals, Kurt Weill, Peter Lorre, Käthe Kollwitz, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Max Planck, Konstantin Stanislavski, George Grosz, W.H. Auden, Eleanor Roosevelt, Chaim Weizmann, Paul Robeson, Thomas Mann, Robert Frost, and fellow photographers Barbara Morgan, Berenice Abbott, Minor White, Paul Strand, Edward Steichen, Albert Renger-Patzsch, and László Moholy- Nagy are some of the many people she photographed.

His father, a professor of French and Hungarian literature, spent his yearlong sabbatical in the city. This was a time of bour- geois elegance, when coaches carried well-dressed men and women and the Champs-Elysées was free of cafés. When Brassaï returned to the city in 1923, after studying painting in Budapest and Berlin, the Roaring Twenties had trans- formed the quartiers into a bohemian, nighttime playground. Frequenting Montparnasse and Montmartre, Brassaï soon found himself in a milieu of artists and writers, including Picasso, Dalí, and Henry Miller. As a writer and painter, Brassaï coined a pseudonym based on the name of his birth- place, Brasov, because he felt his name was too difficult to spell.2 He spent his first few years in Paris as a journalist, sometimes with André Kertész as the accompanying photog- rapher. In the early years in Paris, Brassaï was not interested in photography, preferring to experience life firsthand rather than through the lens of a camera. It was not until Brassaï was thirty that he began to make photographs. Inspired by Kertész's excitement for the medium, he borrowed a camera, but soon invested in his own. Brassaï, a self-proclaimed /7nocta m bul ist," prowled the streets, sleeping during the day and venturing out at night into Montparnasse and Montmartre. Brassaï met Henry Miller in 1 930 and introduced the author to the noctambu- list's Paris, a Paris that would find its way into Miller's nov- els. Dubbing him "the eye of Paris," Miller characterized the photographer in his novel The Tropic of Cancer. Revealing "the beauty of sinister things," as his friend Jacques Prévert, the popular French poet, so aptly described, Brassaï uncov- ered the denizens of the underworld in the bars and dance halls, candidly portraying prostitutes, patrons, and criminals. Fille ou Billard Russe, Brassa'fs portrait of a prostitute in a watering hole in the Boulevard du Rochechouart, is proof of the photographer's philosophy of picture-making (he called it "an act, an artistic event"). Brassaï was a careful photogra- pher, making only two or three photographs of his subjects and stressing that he "wanted to feel that the photographs were made and not won in the lottery."3 Brassaï's Fille au Billard Russe is a candid ¡mage of a woman who is bold and self-assured. The photograph recalls the mademoiselle of Manet's Bar at the Folies Bergère. Manet's mademoiselle, however, is somewhat withdrawn in her demeanor, whereas Brassaï's billiard player exudes confidence, confronting the viewer's voyeurism directly (Figure 4). Brassaï evoked the grittiness of the city at night through anec- dotes and ¡mages. He felt that this side of Paris, the fringe world, represented the city at "its most alive, its most authen- tic," and "that in these colorful faces of its underworld there had been preserved, from age to age, almost without alter- ation, the folklore of its most remote past."4 A voracious reader, Brassaï cited the works of Stendahl, Dostoyevski, and Nietzsche as producing characters that inspired his interest in this fringe of society. He did his utmost to be welcomed or accepted by befriending regulars and returning frequently to the establishments that he photo- graphed. The natural candor of his ¡mages sets the scene, erotic yet sensitive, in a manner which makes them tender documents of a city he loved.

Museum Shop Fund 71:1 993 Born into a Jewish family in Vienna, who changed their sur- name from Stern to Seybert because of anti-Semitism, Lisette Model began her artistic career in 1920 under the tutelage of the composer Arnold Schönberg. Model's childhood dream was to become a concert pianist, and thus she had sought out Schönberg, the most influential teacher in Vienna. It was this period, during which Model was exposed to the contemporary art scene through her association with Schönberg, that had a profound influence on her vision. The sensual and raw emotional qualities of Austrian expressionist painters like Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka, and Gustav Klimt, and Schönberg 's radical departure from convention can be related to the spirit of the photographs Model would later make. Model was an inveterate manipulator of her own history and often embellished her experiences, so consequently it has been difficult for historians to provide an accurate account of her life. However, it is known that in 1926 Model moved to Paris to study voice and, during this period, formed a friend- ship with the photographers Rogi André (the first wife of pho- tographer André Kertész) and Florence Henri (see page 58). In 1933, Model gave up music to study painting with André Lhote. Model began to photograph with a camera she bor- rowed from Rogi André, with whom she roamed the streets of Paris. Florence Henri also took Model under her wing. In the summer of 1 934, Model produced what is considered to be some of her most important photographic work. For Model, the world was a stage, and she photographed both the fringes of society and the bourgeois, employing the same directness for each. On a visit to see her mother in Nice, Model haunted the Promenade des Anglais on the edge of the sea. There the bourgeois, engaged in their leisure activities (as depicted by the elderly lady and her dog in the photo- graph here), became the subject of Model's critical eye. A selection of Model's photographs from the Promenade des Anglais was published in the journal Regards in 1935 with a biting text that left nothing to the imagination: "The Promenade des Anglais is a zoo, to which have come to loll in white armchairs the most hideous speci- mens of the human animal. Boredom, disdain, the most insolent stupidity, and sometimes brutality mark these faces. These comfortably off people who spend most of their time getting dressed, doing their nails and putting on makeup never manage to hide the decadence, the incommensurable wasteland of middle-class thinking."1 Regards was a left-directed magazine to which important lit- erary figures like André Gide and Maksim Gorky con- tributed. Model's true intention for these photographs is not known, but their criticism seems harsh, even without the aid of text. Model came from a well-to-do background, however her family experienced an economic and social downfall as a result of World War I, so she may have had mixed feel- ings towards the bourgeois subjects that she photographed. As many of the European artists of the time, Model and her husband, Evsa, moved to America just before the war began, where they were active in the artistic community. The expressive directness and irony which Model employed to represent the people of Nice informed her later New York portraits and became the foundation for the work of many contemporary photographers today. A passionate and uncompromising instructor, Model exerted a powerful influ- ence that can be seen most readily in the work of her most famous pupil, Diane Arbus, whose blunt and scathing irony is legendary in the field of photography. Model's pho- tographs made on the Promenade are uncompromising, yet they do not exploit; they embody her famous dictum: "Shoot from the gut!"

Man became a regular contributor to Berlin's daily paper, B-Z Am Mittag, after World War I. Working at night for the early morning deadline, Man sketched out illustrations for stories, using a camera to assist his memory. It was during this time that photographs were being used more frequently to illustrate articles, and Man tapped this new market. He participated in the development of modern photojournalism. Advancements in this area were the result, in part, of a num- ber of technological advances. Smaller format cameras such as the Ermanox, a small-plate camera with a large aperture, and the 35mm camera revolutionized the capacity for up-to- the-minute action photography with a previously unheard of naturalism. By the 1 890s, photographs had become a feasible means of illustration in newspapers and journals due to the development of a halftone screen printing process, which could reproduce photographs. In the mid-nineteenth century, newsworthy events were recorded by Roger Fenton, who covered the Crimean War, and by George N. Barnard, Timothy O'Sullivan, Alexander Gardner, and Mathew Brady, who all covered the Civil War in the United States. These photographers, however, were not able to capture the "action" of the war because their equipment was too cumbersome and their film too slow. In the early years of Man's association with B-Z Am Mittag, only a few other photographers were making a living as pho- tojournalists. Most had come to the profession by way of other occupations and interests. Photo agencies also evolved to meet the demands of the new market. They were instrumen- tal in the development of story ideas and the administration of assignments. Man was made production manager of one of the earliest photo agencies, Dephot (Deutsches Photodienst), which later became a cooperative. In Berlin, Man rapidly gained a reputation for his work, contributing to many illustrated journals in Germany, including Morgenpost, Tempo, and Berliner Illustrierte. Considered by Man to be his most important photo interview, A Day in the Life of Mussolini captured the false ostentation of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's existence. Man was granted an interview with Mussolini (// Duce) in January 1931 . Working with a 4 1/2 x 6-inch Ermanox camera, Man was only able to carry between 15 and 20 glass plates with him on his assignments. In Benito Mussolini in His Study, Man captures his initial response to the vastness and artificial- ity of the space. Led into the heavily guarded Palazzo Venezia, he perceived II Duce. Man recalls: "He was behind his writing table, slightly bent forward, studying some papers. He did not look up, but I felt, I was aware that he watched my entrance with a stealthy look. It takes about half a minute to cover twenty-five yards, time enough to calculate a visitor's qualities. How does he behave when walking across the highly pol- ished marble floor, smooth as a mirror? How greatly is he impressed by these amazing surroundings? How frightened is he by the echo of his own footsteps?"1 Man stayed with Mussolini all day, photographing him when- ever he wanted, without the poses or theatrical gestures that were so typical of II Duce. Man was limited to the twelve glass plates that he carried with him to the palace, so he had to be careful not to waste any film. He worked with a tripod, and Mussolini never knew when he was to be photographed; an unusual situation for the leader, who was used to carefully manipulating and controlling the ¡mage that he presented. As a former journalist, however, Mussolini did appreciate Man's approach, letting him have free reign over the ¡mages. It was Man's only opportunity to photograph the infamous leader, and other attempts to photograph him were met with a nega- tive response. "Perhaps" said Man, "the Duce did not like my having shown his true face to the world."2 Signed and dated verso in graphite, l.r.: Felix H. Man; verso in orange ink: Felix H.

It is at that moment that mastering an ¡mage becomes a great physical and intellectual joy/'1 - Henri Cartier-Bresson Henri Cartier-Bresson was as much an adventurer as an artist, and photography became the medium with which this expression was best articulated. Cartier-Bresson's life reads like an adventure novel. Travelling from country to country seeking out adventure, Cartier-Bresson met and befriended some of the most important artists and writers of his time. In 1930, fueled by the colorful domain of the café society, Cartier-Bresson left Paris for Africa. This journey would spark his interest in photography. In 1932, Cartier-Bresson purchased a streamlined 35mm Leica camera. From then on, he took to the medium with fer- vor. He utilized the Leica 's ability to make spontaneous ¡mages, creating some of his most memorable ¡mages between 1932 and 1934. Wherever he went, Cartier-Bresson "prowled the streets all day, feeling very strung-up and ready to pounce, determined to "trap7 life - to preserve life in the act of living." "Above all," he recalls, "I craved to seize the whole essence, in the confines of a single photograph, of some situation that was in the process of unrolling itself before my eyes."2 Behind the Gore St. Lazare is a photograph from this period - an image that has helped shape our collective memory of modern European photography. Cartier-Bresson was never one for cropping or manipulating the final ¡mage. He preferred the purity of composition within the viewfinder and felt that intuition as well as intelligence went into the construction of a successful photograph. Behind the Gare St. Lazare was one such ¡mage. Waiting for the precise moment, he wedged the camera into a gap in a fence and tripped the shutter, capturing the fugitive moment. Cartier-Bresson wrote: "For me photography is a sketch book, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity, the master of the instant which - in visual terms - questions and decides simultaneously."3 Cartier-Bresson 's virtuosity for graphic design within the pic- ture plane, combined at times with the surreality of the sub- jects, manifested itself early in his career. Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris, defines the concept of the "decisive moment," a term which Cartier-Bresson coined. A ghostly anagram of a figure, the man in the foreground of Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare hangs in the air, his silhouette chal- lenging the three-dimensionality of the scene. Meanwhile, the background of rooftops suggests a mountainous landscape, while a figure on the billboard behind echoes the man's energetic leap. Moved by the ideas of André Breton, a founder of Surrealism, Cartier-Bresson peppered his imagery with surre- alist references. While the photographs of Maurice Tabard, Hans Bellmer, or Man Ray were consciously constructed, Cartier-Bresson's surrealistic ¡mages made use of extraordi- nary juxtapositions and the symbolic potential of the quotidi- an world. As Cartier-Bresson's interesting and full life indi- cates, he was not a follower of any one particular influence, but organized transient modern life by connecting a number of artistic influences such as Surrealism, Cubism, and even the work of early Renaissance masters like Piero della Francesco or Jan van Eyck. In 1947, Cartier-Bresson founded the Magnum photo-cooper- ative with his compatriots Robert Capa, George Rodger, and David Seymour (Chim). Magnum continues today to be com- mitted to "the ¡deal of the 'concerned photographer.'" Cartier-Bresson helped shape an aspect of photojournalism that presents an experience of reality that is interpretive, leaving room for the mind to make its own connections. In 1 957, he brought his early work together in the now classic book entitled The Decisive Moment. The concept pinpointed by Cartier-Bresson, that of composition as a choreographic coalescence of movement, continues to fuel the vision of many contemporary photographers.

Gift of Dr. and Mrs. Gary R. Hansen 3 1 7: 1 986 At the age of six, André Kertész discovered the illustrations of a Hungarian satirical magazine in the attic of his uncle's house. He considered this moment a revelation, wanting to create camera ¡mages as effective as the illustrations he had encountered.1 Kertész bought his first camera in 1912 when he had just finished school and was about to follow the fami- ly's direction into business at the stock exchange. During the next two years, he recorded life in Budapest and in the rural districts surrounding the city. He quickly developed a sophis- ticated style, employing a rhythmic balance of elements in his compositions. Kertész decided to make photography his 'life's work" in 1925, when he moved to Paris. Having saved enough money to support himself for two years, he left his home- land in the hopes of finding his true direction in photogra- phy. There, Kertész naturally sought out other Hungarians for intellectual and moral support. They would meet at the Café du Dôme to exchange ideas or play chess. A photog- rapher of the quotidian and the enchanted, Kertész devel- oped his vision by feasting on the caché of urban ¡mages all around him. Made during his second year ¡n Paris, Satiric Dancer charac- terizes the hghthearted atmosphere among his circle of Hungarian friends. In her essay on Kertész, Sandra Phillips describes satire as an important element of what she terms the "Budapest Spirit' of the turn of the century: "Characterized by a spirit of lighthearted fun, of satirizing everything, of extem- porizing, this lively quality of Budapest culture was centered in the cafés and cabarets . . ."2 Kertész captures the magic Figure 5 André Kertész Chez Mondrian, 1926 (printed later) gelatin silver print The Saint Louis Art Museum Gift of Barbara and Gary Hansen 213:1987 moment when Magda Förstner, an aspiring actress and singer, pokes fun at a sculpture by István Beöthy. Kertész never associated himself with any specific artistic group in Paris at the time, but would instead incorporate sub- tle characteristics of their expression in his work. His pho- tographs were often enigmatic, and the Surrealists found in them an affinity to their own artistic goals. He was described by the Surrealist Pierre Mac Orlan as a " poet-photographer." Man Ray and the Surrealists were active in the Montparnasse area where Kertész lived. During this time, Kertész also met and photographed artists like Fernand Léger, Tristan Tzara, and Piet Mondrian, in whose studio he made the famous photograph Chez Mondrian in 1926 (Figure 5). Kertész recalled that Mondrian's studio was very spare and minimal, which he reflected in his geometric com- position. The single flower that occupies a vase in the fore- ground was, for Kertész, a symbol of Mondrian's harmonic existence and spirituality. For Mondrian, the flower symbol- ized a feminine presence that was nonexistent.3 In 1 935, Kertész moved to New York and, in the remaining years before the outbreak of World War II, his photographs and photo-essays appeared in Harper's Bazaar, Town and Country, and Vogue. However with the outbreak of World War II, Kertész was forced by the United States government to register as an enemy alien, making it difficult if not impos- sible for him to photograph outdoors or take assignments. A photographer of conviction and independence, however, Kertész's references continued to transcend barriers, inspir- ing generations of photographers. Signed and dated verso in graphite, center: A.

Museum Shop Fund 1 24: 1 990 Born in Lyon, France, Maurice Tabard came to the United States in 1914 with his father, who was a silk manufacturer. Tabard studied art and textile design, but soon became inter- ested in photography. He enrolled in the New York Institute of Photography in 1916. There, the portrait work of Edward Steichen, Arnold Genthe, and other professional photogra- phers engaged him. In 1922 he joined the staff of the Baltimore branch of the renowned Bachrach Studio, where he had the opportunity to photograph many important Washington leaders. In 1928, Tabard returned to France to seek work in fashion photography. His initial contact there was the poet and editor Philippe Soupault, who helped him get assignments with Journal des Modes, Vu, and Vogue. He also met the Surrealists Man Ray and René Magritte, with whom he became good friends. As in Unfitted, Tabard's complex images incorporated double exposure, montage, solarization, negative printing, and fore- shortening, techniques central to Surrealist strategies. These effects were used in Surrealist imagery to alienate reality and establish an alternate state. In his best-known ¡mages, of which Unfitted is an example, Tabard fragments the female form by layering ¡mages in multiple printing, a technique favored by the Surrealists for its capacity to render the effect of dream and alternate realities. The female form, a classic art historical subject, found many new incarnations in the time of the "new vision/' both in photography and painting. Picasso's ¿es Desmoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Duchamp's Nude Descending o Staircase (1912) reduced the figure to multifaceted visual components and depicted variations in time and space. The Surrealists also often deconstructed or reconfigured the female figure in their imagery. In her book The Second Sex (1949), Simone de Beauvoir concluded that the Surrealist woman was a stereotype, an object for the contemplation of men, but without her own independence. These deconstruc- tions relate to the Surrealist interest in transformation, but they also carry a deeper connotation. André Breton wrote in his Surrealist Manifesto, "Isn't what matters that we be the masters of ourselves, the masters of women, and of love too?"1 The notion which de Beauvoir pinpoints, and Breton demands, constitutes a power play which is also forcefully illustrated in the photographs of Hans Bellmer (see page 24) and in the paintings and drawings of Salvador Dalí. In his most successful surrealist evocations, Tabard superim- poses ¡mages of female figures, both clothed and nude, with a number of other disparate ¡mages. In Unfitted, Tabard pre- sents the ¡mage of a woman ¡n an evening gown juxtaposed against a fragmented female nude, while a shadow behind the woman's head mimics the nude form opposite. Tabard often used the same images ¡n varying combinations, experi- menting with their suggestive qualities. Tabard's superimposi- tions are, with the brûlages of Raoul Ubac (made by printing from a burned or melted negative) and the solarizations of Man Ray, among the most effective Surrealist conceptions, creating a phantasmagoric dream state. The solidity of the model juxtaposed against the ghostly imprint of the shadowy nudes acts to join the worlds of reality and imagination.

Museum Shop Fund 159:1987 "If my work is found to scandalize, that is because for me the world is scandalous."1 - Hans Bellmer Hans Bellmer began his life subject to the contrasting tem- peraments of a stern and authoritarian father and an idealis- tic and dreamy mother. With the rise of the National Socialist (Nazi) party, which Bellmer's father had joined, Bellmer rebelled against the status quo and began to think of ways in which his actions might form a protest against the state. The result was the "useless act" (as Bellmer termed it) of constructing a large female mannequin. The doll was an elaborate figure composed of an armature articulated with wooden ball joints. It could undergo myriad transformations. As visible in the photograph here, the pelvis- es were reversible and could represent either buttocks or breasts and shoulders. Built into its stomach was a mecha- nism that contained six miniature panoramas consisting of "little objects, diverse material and colored ¡mages in bad taste" that were to represent the "thoughts and dreams of a young girl. "2 One might argue that Bellmer's doll was like a slap in the face to the Nazi regime, where woman was esteemed for her ability to produce offspring. The doll was merely an effigy, a signifier and reminder of barrenness, unable to give but only receive attentions of the male gaze. Flying in the face of new moral values and reacting to the dis- integration of the social fabric as a consequence of the war, the Surrealists conceptualized the libido, chance, and the dream in order to formulate a new sense of the sacred. The doll, for Bellmer, represented a chance to "re-create the heights of passion . . . [and] invent new desires." Bellmer played "Pygmalion," creating a "Galatea" that was to "awak- en all desires." Dolls, mannequins, and robots all figured prominently in Surrealist creations, both before and after Bellmer's invention: Oskar Kokoshka's dinner and theater com- panion, a life-sized doll; Salvador Dali's mannequins; and Man Ray's half-woman/half-doll "coat stand" are among the best known "fetish women" during this time. The inspiration for Bellmer's doll came from a character in Jacques Offenbach's opera Tales of Hoffmann, which featured an auto- mated doll named Olympia in the principal role. The deconstruction and distortion of the female figure was a central element of Surrealism. Bellmer's dismemberment and re-assemblage of the doll has been regarded as a Surrealist exercise of disorientation, but the inherent violence in the ¡mages is impossible to ignore. In this regard, one might read the grotesque transformation of the female form as a symbol for power displacement anxiety, a fertile topic for the Surrealists that was addressed by Sigmund Freud as "castra- tion anxiety." Bellmer's doll might thus be seen as a "Surrealist anxiety object" created in the form of a transmut- ed prepubescent woman, a passive figure onto which the anxieties and desires of men could be projected. Bellmer's doll could be "castrated" (dismembered) and "reborn" (reassembled) in a number of incarnations. Fear, alienation, and abandonment also play roles in the imagery of the doll, as Bellmer consistently places her alone and in vulnerable positions. Herbert Lust has described this particular version of La Poupée as "perhaps the greatest anx- iety photograph in Surrealism," evoking a fear of alienation, and abandonment.3 Eluard's ninth poem of Les Jeux de La Poupeé, and the poem paired with La Poupée in the St. Louis collection, perhaps relates best to this ¡mage: "In the house with warped floors, with sagging roof, in the stairway with steps carpeted with old slippers, she is thick, opaque and raw. In a word she is alone. Alone, her cold and muddy frame, alone and without her eyes, impossibly alone. It's elsewhere that pure air falls straight down on the appearances for a community life."4 Unsigned Inscribed verso in graphite, I. I: Bellmer-6.

No stranger to the artistic endeavors of the European avant-garde, Man Ray had been a patron of Alfred Stieglitz's Gallery 291 , where modern European artists like Pablo Picasso, Constantin Brancusi, and Marcel Duchamp were producing works that challenged traditional definitions of art. At the same time that he was earning a living documenting works of art and making portraits of artists, writers, film mak- ers, and patrons, Man Ray expressed Surrealist fantasies through a number of media including painting, sculpture, and photography. Photography in particular became for Man Ray a medium perfectly suited to fabricate alternate realities. Man Ray transformed ordinary objects through the selective use of light and with darkroom manipulation. For the Surrealists, objects, and even figures-as-objects, established their own independence from the real world, cre- ating a hyperreality. Man Ray's effective use of chiaroscuro lighting and simple but powerful sense of form in La Prière transforms the female figure into what could be interpreted as an enormous fruit. The Surrealists often used objects to suggest the human body or its parts. In Lo Prière, Man Ray transforms one familiar form into another. Like Hans Bellmer with his manipulated dolls, Man Ray also fetishized and objectified women with his transformations of the female form. In addition to the anthropomorphic quality of the object, love, sensuality, and the erotic were elemental to the life of the Surrealists. In this regard, the female figure was presented, investigated, manipulated, and reconfigured in myriad of ways to create a fetish that would satisfy the hunger for these "desires." Writers such as Rimbaud, de Sade, and Lautréamont, with their unconventional ideas about sexuality and love, were among those whose work inspired the Surrealists. The Surrealists felt that true "inner life" could only be achieved through the exploration of human passion and eroticism. L'amour fou (crazy love) was a state that held the highest esteem because the subversive force of desire and the liberating power of love were seen as a provocation against the established social fabric. Man Ray's poetic titles further enhance the morphic effect of the photographed object. He explains: "Tve always attached titles to my objects. They do not explain the work, but add what you might call a literary element to it that sets the mind going."2 A rare vintage print and one of Man Ray's most sensual photographs, Lo Prière is seductively enhanced by a suggestive title. It speaks to the power of sensuality while making an irreverent stab at the establishment.

Friends Fund 7:1983 "The photographer is a sculptor of light, photography is the organization of light."1 - László Moholy-Nagy László Moholy-Nagy became a member of the Bauhaus fac- ulty in 1923, heading the Metal Workshop and teaching the Vorkurs, an introductory course that explored the organiza- tion of form and space and the structural capabilities of vari- ous media. Photography was one of the media used to explore these principles, and light was the subject that was manipulated through the use of a technique called the pho- togram. In this course, as in his own work, Moholy-Nagy employed Utopian theories regarding the alliance of art and industry, promoting the use of industrial materials such as steel, plastic, and glass. He was also partly inspired by the conflicting ideologies of Constructivism and Suprematism. While both utilized abstract, nonobjective forms, the Constructivists promoted a utilitarian rather than a romantic, individual experience, and the Suprematists felt that art should be a personal experience independent of political and social function. In 1922 Moholy-Nagy and his wife, Lucia Moholy, devel- oped the photogram in response to their inquiry regarding the "problems arising from the antithesis of Production versus Reproduction," which they articulated in the classic essay Production/Reproduction (1922).2 Lucia Moholy was instru- mental in the development of Moholy-Nagy's interest in the medium of photography, supplying editorial and darkroom support. The essay stated that man had to fulfill a "biologi- cal" need of creative production rather than the rote duplica- tion of "reproduction." Moholy-Nagy singled out the tech- nique of the photogram for this purpose as it produced a unique, nonrepresentational work of art. Moholy-Nagy's quest was to activate space by building tension within it. This was achieved through the interaction of light and form in space, as seen in the photogram Abstraction. A tech- nique in which light is projected onto translucent and opaque objects placed on photographic paper, the photogram consti- tuted the realization of the Suprematist notion of dematerial- ized art and the Constructivist's use of modern technology. To create these mysterious ¡mages, Moholy-Nagy placed lenses, mirrors, oil, acids, crystal, metal, glass, and tissue on the pho- tographic paper. In Abstraction, Moholy-Nagy creates a perfectly balanced macrocosm by juxtaposing bright rectangular forms with ones barely discernible, recalling the cosmic infinities creat- ed by Kazimir Malevich. The photogram Abstraction was produced in 1925, the same year Moholy-Nagy's first book, Painting, Photography, Film, was published. In this book, Moholy-Nagy linked the utilitarian and the spiritual, coalesc- ing his earlier ideas and theories. In photograms like Abstraction, Moholy-Nagy continued his investigation of the play of light and dark, and the organiza- tion of line and form that he had begun in his paintings, drawings, and sculptures. When Moholy-Nagy said, "The photographer is a sculptor of light, photography is the orga- nization of light,"3 he was referring to the medium's unique ability to create structure and three-dimensionality in a two- dimensional field. In Abstraction, Moholy plays with the sculptural effects of light, creating the effect of a bird flying in a cosmic void, while pulsating geometric forms balance the gesture of its departure.

Friends Fund 38:1993 László Moholy-Nagy continued the investigation of light and shadow begun in his photograms with "camera-images" like Double Torso. Double Torso is one of his most successful investigations of the chiaroscuro effect of light on modulated surfaces, and the print of the ¡mage in the Saint Louis Art Museum is a particularly fine one in which velvety blacks and shining white highlights are mediated by subtly gradat- ed gray tones. In this photograph, Moholy-Nagy steps away from the linear constructions of his photograms and painting compositions employing the curves of the body to explore the modeling effects of light, creating what he termed a "light modulator." Moholy-Nagy saw the capacity for many things to be light modulators. A light modulator, unlike a flat surface, has curves that act as reflectors, creating modulated or graded tones. For Moholy-Nagy, the human body was a perfect example, its curves and varied textures capable of reflecting light in complex ways. In Double Torso, Moholy- Nagy concentrates attention to form and texture, subverting the subject by emphasizing the shadows that fragment the bodies of his models. The "biological" need for "optical experiences" is a recur- rent theme in Moholy-Nagy's prolific writings. He addresses these ideas in terms of formal harmonies that he felt con- tributed to the creation of a "wholeness of life." The building of tension in the picture plane and the interaction of light and shadow play primary roles. Moholy-Nagy found the per- ceptual and sensory requirements of the individual in an environment to be equally as important as the "biological" necessity of a clean, comfortable, safe, and pleasant envi- ronment.1 Both biological and intellectual harmonies are exemplified in Moholy-Nagy's photograph Double Torso. The wonderful sense of freedom and contentment in the attitudes of the sun- bathing figures is a reminder of the German idea of Freikörperkultur (nudism), which was an anti-urban reform movement begun in the late nineteenth century. The nudism promoted by these reformers represented a pure attitude towards the body rather than that of "animal" sexuality.2 They sought to be reunited with nature, which they believed would purify the mind and soul. Thus Moholy-Nagy's figures in Double Torso not only present a means for the analysis of light, but also act as a metaphor for a liberated existence. Unsigned Bibliography Butts, Barbara.

I decipher in a new way a world unknown to you/'1 - Dziga Vertov Alexander Mikhailovich Rodchenko began his artistic career as a painter, exhibiting with Suprematist Kazimir Malevich and Constructive Vladimir Tatlin, among others. In the early 1920s, he was a member of the First Working Group of Constructivists in Moscow. The artists in this group aban- doned the exhausted traditions of representational painting and fostered the creation of a new artistic ideology which reflected the spirit of a modern technological era.2 The ideas of Tatlin in particular were fostered by Rodchenko, who used painting, sculpture, typography, and photography in his own artistic expression of modern ideologies. Through his experi- mentation and active engagement within the movement, Rodchenko soon became a central figure in the school of Constructive ideology and a chief proponent of the New Vision photography in Russia. As a painter, sculptor, architect, and a designer of functional objects, posters, and propaganda materials (production art), Rodchenko naturally became interested in photography as a medium with which to express both modern life and the " passion and pathos of our new socialist reality/'3 The pro- motion of new technology as a means to represent a new society was a basic tenet of Constructivism. True to Constructivist ideology, Rodchenko declared, "Only the cam- era seems to be really capable of describing modern life." Rodchenko's experience with film also helped to coalesce his visual style. He collaborated on projects with filmmakers like Dziga Vertov, whose 1924 film Kino-GIoz (Camera-Eye) cele- brated visual experiences that only the camera could achieve.4 Rodchenko's means were simple but his viewpoint was fresh. He primarily photographed subjects in the real world, manip- ulating only the angle of vision. As in Woman with o Camero, Rodchenko employed the freedom and spontaneity of a hand-held camera to create a viewpoint that was based on the purely optical and mechanical eye of the camera.5 Skewed camera angles, tilted horizons, and industrial or urban subject matter were some of the means that Rodchenko employed to celebrate modernity, creating a new visual language for a new society. When Rodchenko photographed people, he constructed an image that was a combination of the Constructivist's desire to represent the world in a new or surprising way and the hero- icizing utilitarianism of production art. The social structure of post-revolutionary Russia made room for a new independent woman, whom Rodchenko celebrated by creating a heroic ¡mage of a woman photographer, Woman with a Comera. Depicting the photojournalist Eugenia Lemberg,6 the image's visual dynamism, created by the position of the subject and Rodchenko's use of diagonal background lines, makes Woman with a Comera an ¡conic ¡mage of the modern pho- tographer.

Museum Shop Fund 70:1993 "I am applying the methods of mechanical optics as a technical means of representation, much as I would use the palette, the spray gun or color. With modern optics, the artist who expresses himself with photography has at his disposal a completely new means of rendering the physical world not to speak of the transformation of a desired subject matter/'1 - Herbert Bayer Perhaps best known for his imaginative designs and pure elemental typography, Herbert Bayer was truly an artist of many talents. Bayer used photography in the design of posters and book covers and for reference, creating an "opti- cal diary" where he recorded the forms of foreign architec- ture. In his photographs, he utilized the geometric ideas of Constructivism and Cubism to meld graphic design with pho- tography. His use of strong diagonals and unusual view- points, like those in Radpanne, make his photographs excel- lent examples of the New Vision. Bayer began his long association with the Bauhaus in 1921, when he applied as a student. After studying at the school for three years, Bayer took a year off to travel and work in Italy, returning in 1925 to accept a teaching position at the Bauhaus. When Bayer took leave from the Bauhaus after the resignation of director Walter Gropius in 1928, photography became increasingly important to him as an artistic medium. Using a small-format camera that allowed him great freedom of movement, he made a series of photographs that investi- gated the optical capabilities of the medium and explored the abstract structure and sculptural qualities of his subjects. The individual character of the object was also accentuated through his use of experimental viewpoints. Although Bayer used photography as an optical diary, he was also aware of its transformative capabilities. Bayer credits Cubism for making him aware of how uncommon points of view were used to create a new way of looking at the world. "I remember I once photographed a chair. It was only an object, but it was interesting. It had a life of its own. So I tried to photograph it in a new way that would bring out its character. ... I suppose the concept came partly from the Cubists' idea of penetrating the subject or object to show it from all sides, then recombining it again to show a conglomerate of images."2 Bayer was interested in "bringing out the character" of things, transforming everyday objects and revealing layers of the world previously unfamiliar. He used radical viewpoints to make this possible. Bayer's Rodponne is such an ¡mage. Probably taken on his bicycle trip to southern France in the summer of 1928, Bayer's ¡mage exploits an unfortunate moment, finding in the blown-out bicycle wheel a situation for artistic creation. By highlighting the dynamic formal quali- ties of a flat tire in his extreme close-up view, Bayer creates an innovative composition. He balances a system of cutting diagonals with the curve of the tire's edge. The close-up viewpoint that Bayer employs flattens the composition, yet the middle grays of the shadows resurrect the space, re-creat- ing depth. Rodponne was one of twenty-six contributions that he made to the 1929 Film und Foto exhibition. The print of the image in the museum's collection is a particularly large and tonally rich example of this key ¡mage in Bayer's oeuvre.

Funds given by Donors to the 1995 Annual Appeal 3:1996 In 1 936, Herbert Bayer produced a series of photographs called fotoplostiks, a term László Moholy-Nagy had also used to describe his own photomontages which were quite different from Bayer's more sculptural investigations. With his fotoplostiks, Bayer brought together the sculptural potential of the medium with its ability to create fictive "environments/7 Most of Bayer's fotoplastiks relate directly to a series of paintings made in the same year entitled Dunstlöcher. In these works, Bayer used ropes, wooden wagon wheel shapes, bone and scythe forms, and geometric shapes to create formal compositions that referred directly and indirect- ly to archaic shapes and textures that he had encountered many years earlier on trips to rural Austria. Although most of the fotoplostiks are sculptural investigations, a few works from the series are imbued with a surreal quali- ty. His ¡mages often contained deformations, insubstantiality, or dreamlike juxtapositions. When describing the technique of photomontage, Bayer frequently used the word "surreal/' It was in his Dreom series of photomontages, completed between 1931 and 1932, that he came closest to pure Surrealism. However, some of his later fotoplostiks share the sense of fantasy and illusion. Bayer's constructed images are enigmatic, and the symbolic objects he uses relate either to the natural or the manmade and carry archetypal symbolism. In much of his work, Bayer combines the natural and the manmade in constructed spaces. He often makes reference to terrestrial events like weather, wind, and clouds, juxtaposing them with geometric forms or the archaic shapes he encountered during his days in Austria. Metamorphosis is an example of Bayer's adherence to the balance of nature and culture. Considered to be Bayer's most direct and successful rendering of spatial and symbolic issues, the fotoplastik animates the elements of Primary Sculpture I, a photograph made in 1 935 consisting of ele- mental geometric forms situated against a corrugated work surface. Utilizing the cone, sphere, cylinder, and cube, Bayer arranges them against an ¡mage of nature: contrasting rea- son and emotion. Metamorphosis seems to recall the story of Plato's cave. The geometric forms, symbols of elemental rea- son, leave the darkness of the cave and strive towards the enlightenment of discourse with the natural world. A recur- ring theme in Bayer's work, the cube, ball, and cone were used by Bayer as part of a cover design for the Bauhaus Zeitschrift in 1928, and at the entrance to the Stuttgart exhi- bition 50 Jahre Bauhaus in 1968. These ¡cons became Bayer's " personal shorthand for the Bauhaus aesthetic."1 In 1938, Bayer emigrated to the United States where his first commissions were exhibition designs. His unique sense of aesthetics was recognized by Walter Paepcke, chairman of the Container Corporation of America, who commissioned him to produce a number of design projects for the compa- ny. In 1 946, Paepcke asked Bayer to work on what would amount to a gesamtkunstwerk of architecture and landscape design, a "total environment" that would be an institute for humanistic studies in Aspen, Colorado. This creation of a complete facility in a landscape partially designed and par- tially wild, fulfilled Bayer's dream for reconciling nature and culture.

There is an urgent need to examine old opinions and look at things from a new viewpoint. There must be an increase in the ¡oy one takes in the object, and the photographer should become fully conscious of the splendid fidelity of repro- duction made possible by this technique/'1 - Albert Renger-Patzsch Albert Renger-Patzsch provided an analysis of the everyday world through photographs that elevated the mundane to the remarkable. In 1928 he produced a book titled Die Welt ist Schön (The World Is Beautiful), which explored the relation- ships between organic and industrial forms. Renger-Patzsch 's carefully constructed formal arrangements characterized images of the New Objectivity, a movement which promoted objective realism in the representation of the subject. The photographs of Albert Renger-Patzsch were ¡deal catalysts for the prevailing revolution in photographic imagemaking in the 1 920s. Everywhere, artists and critics called for the uti- lization of the natural optical capabilities of the camera, and a divorce from the pictorialism that had linked the medium to old traditions of painting. The World Is Beautiful was a publication that would be a key work of the New Objectivity movement. Following the basic tenets of Modernism, Renger-Patzsch championed the beauty in the everyday by taking natural and industrial sub- jects and giving them equal footing in terms of an aesthetic beauty. The supporters of Renger-Patzsch criticized not only photography that aped painting but also the experimental photography of Moholy-Nagy and others like him, which they perceived as self-involved. Most reactions to The World Is Beautiful were positive, but an opposing view also existed. Walter Benjamin criticized the lack of humanism in Renger- Patzsch's representation of the world. He argued that a pho- tograph of a factory that celebrates only its beauty belies or obscures its true nature as an area of human relations, as something that has connections to a social whole.2 These atti- tudes may have arisen from the book's title. Renger-Patzsch had originally intended to call his book Die Dinge (Objects), but his publisher thought The World Is Beautiful would be a more commercially successful title. Renger-Patzsch was disap- pointed with the publisher's decision and dismissed the book as merely a "calling card."3 While Renger-Patzsch has been linked to the New Objectivity movement, there is also a visionary aspect to his work. Unfitted (Machine Part) clearly encompasses a "joy before the object" as well as a sense of the epiphanic expe- rience. It is evident that Renger-Patzsch's experience with the machine part of Unfitted was one of great admiration and wonder for the object itself, its sensuality and, at the same time, its technological beauty. The contemplation of the object as well as the crafting of the ¡mage through the viewfinder were all part of the spiritual experience. Renger- Patzsch communicates this in Unfitted (Machine Part) through his use of dramatic light and warm-toned paper, conjuring up a sense of materiality and texture. The gleam of the metal that emanates from within the dark forms creates a truly sub- lime visual experience. Although this ¡mage was not included ¡n The World Is Beautiful, similar machine part close-ups are featured in the book. The World Is Beautiful represents a turning point in the history of photography and is one of the most important pho- tographic books published to date. Signed and dated in graphite, center: R.

James Marchael Memorial Fund 8:1983 Piet Zwart was a major proponent of modern photography in Holland, organizing the Dutch submissions to the interna- tional Film und Foto exhibition (1929) in Stuttgart, Germany. Together with Paul Schuitema, Zwart launched Dutch photog- raphy into the modern era. In 1923, El Lissitzky gave a lec- ture on young Russian artists at the Haagse Kunstkring, the meeting place for the Hague's artist guild. Zwart was impressed with Lissitzky 's use of typography and found in the Russian's works a catalyst for his own investigations. Zwart also formed a friendship with Kurt Schwitters, who visited the Kunstkring earlier in the same year. Later Zwart became a member of Schwitters's organization, Ring neuer Werbegestalter (The Circle of New Advertising Artists). Self-taught as a photographer, Zwart studied art and worked as a graphic, interior, and industrial designer. Zwart called himself a typotekt, a combination of typographer and archi- tect. He is primarily known for his design work, although his photographs were included in many major exhibitions. Both Constructivism and De Stijl played an important role in the development of his photographic vision, which is character- ized by the use of diagonal lines, unusual viewpoints, and a clarity of line and reductive form. The subjects he chose were diverse and included natural forms, industrial subjects, peo- ple, and everyday objects. By the late 1 920s he was fre- quently using photographs in his advertising layouts, which also incorporated innovative typography. Integrating ¡mage and text, Zwart chose ¡mages that were clean, sharp, com- mercial photographs evocative of the idioms of the New Objectivity. In 1 929 Zwart was invited to serve as guest lecturer at the Bauhaus. There, he spent a great deal of time in the depart- ment of photography with Walter Peterhans, acting more as a student than as a docent. This experience was a catalyst for his continued investigation into the medium. He experimented with light and contrast, perspectivai distortions, and the nature of the material, using these effects both in his personal and commercial work.1 Tubular Chair/Floor Composition is one such photograph, made for the Bruynzeel floor factory, that speaks to these formal issues.2 In this photo, Zwart's use of an angular viewpoint combined with the clean lines of a Bauhaus-inspired table creates a composition that speaks of New Vision aesthetics. Producing many interior photographs for commercial applications, Zwart still appears to have had the opportunity to experiment. Zwart was a master of dynam- ic composition, and variants of Tubular Chair/Floor Composition in the collection of the Leiden Print Room reveal that he approached the subject from a number of angles, examining many alternative compositions. In the years between 1929 and 1934, Zwart experimented heavily with the medium. During this time his photographs were primarily functional and made for possible commercial application, however, as in Tubular Chair/Floor Composition, Zwart was always able to successfully combine art and commerce.3 In addition to the photographic commissions for the Bruynzeel factory, Zwart was chief designer on a number of projects, designing furniture, doors, kitchens, and advertising materials.4 Unsigned Inscribed verso in graphite, u.L: Z214; verso in graphite, I.I.: 81.2.15.4; verso in blue graphite, u.c.: S64 Stamped verso in green ink, c.L: piet zwart rijksstraatweg 290/wasse- naar holland Provenance Estate of the artist; Prakapas Gallery Notes 1 Kees Broos, "Zu wenigum unser gesicht zu wahren," in Film und Foto der zwanziger Jahre, by Ute Eskildsen and Christopher Horak (Stuttgart, Germany: VVurttembergischer Kunstverein, 1979), 176. 2 According to a letter from Kees Broos dated 10 March 1996 in the document files of The Saint Louis Art Museum. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 40</page><page sequence="43">41</page><page sequence="44">Joost Schmidt German, 1893-1948 Still Life with Ceramic and Ploying Card, c. 1 928 gelatin silver print 9.9x6.2 cm (3 1 1/16 x 2 7/16 in.) Museum Shop Fund 332:1991 Joost Schmidt was born in Wunstorf, Germany, near Hannover. As a child he was "awed by the wonders of nature: the sun, moon, stars, clouds, thunderstorms and the glorious colors of a rainbow/'1 Schmidt studied physics, biol- ogy, art, and drawing in school. At age 17, he enrolled at the Kunst Académie in Weimar to study painting. During his summer break, Schmidt earned money painting churches, an experience with the interaction of color, form, and plasticity that created a lasting impression. Schmidt writes of the inspi- rations that he found in the surrounding environment during those early years: "In an old church were strange medieval wall paintings, colorful stained glass windows and a pompous Baroque altar, of which I dreamt at night. But too, I was fascinated by the train, the signal towers, the train bridge and the menace of the locomotive."2 These early experiences became the catalyst for Schmidt's later work, which combined the natural and the manmade. In 1 925 Schmidt accepted a position as head of the sculpture workshop at the Bauhaus. He designed a curriculum that directed his students towards an investigation of the elemen- tary relationships between form and space. He initiated exer- cises in which hollow and domed forms and interpénétrations of form and space were analyzed, and an awareness of material beauty was emphasized. These principles are seen in Still Life with Ceramic and Playing Card, which Schmidt made in 1928 after he took over the advertising and typography workshop upon Herbert Bayer's resignation. It was during this time that Schmidt made his most memorable photographs. True to his love of nature, Schmidt's beautiful compositions consisted of shells, starfish, and flowers in small vases inter- spersed with man-made objects of equal delicacy, such as playing cards, glass crystals, and occasionally, typographi- cal elements. Schmidt expressed his interest in material beau- Figure 6 Joost Schmidt Unfitted [Still Life with Tulips), c. 1928 gelatin silver print 8.1 x7.8 cm Collection of the Bauhaus-Archiv Berlin, inv. nr. 9526/ A Reproduction photograph by Markus Hawlik ty, the activation of space, and the effects of light and shad- ow in these compositions. This is evident in Still Life with Ceramic and Playing Card, where the shadows of the vase and glass become sculptural entities, and the objects them- selves form two-dimensional planar forms that play off one another and the background. The unusual angle from which Schmidt approached the subject as well as his method of illu- mination enhances the flattening of the pictorial space. A variant from the Bauhaus-Archiv further illustrates this effect (Figure 6). There, only the shadow of the tulip discloses the reality of its three-dimensional form. Schmidt's experiments in photography are excellent exam- ples of the Bauhaus's integration of the medium into the wider scope of artistic and formal investigation. Although László Moholy-Nagy, Walter Peterhans, Lucia Moholy, Otto Umbehr (Umbo), and Andreas Feininger are among the artists most often associated with photography at the Bauhaus, it is important to remember that photography's practical functions were first investigated in the departments of advertising and design. Schmidt often incorporated pho- tographs into his design layouts, using photography and photomontage to elucidate his message. Schmidt made many important contributions to the Bauhaus philosophy. In accordance with the idea of the gesamtkunst- werk (total artistic experience) that the Bauhaus endeavored to prescribe, the advertising workshop incorporated photog- raphy into its curriculum along with basic typography, techni- cal aspects of printing and reproduction, and life and figure drawing. Schmidt, or "Schmidtchen" (little Schmidt) as he was affectionately known, had a formative influence in the shaping of Bauhaus ideas, effectively promoting the use of photographs along with design and typographic elements.

Friends Fund 41:1995 Metallisches Fest was created in preparation for the "Metallic Festival" of February 1 929, one of a series of themed carni- vals that was held annually at the Bauhaus and considered to be the biggest social event of the season. The Metallic Festival was described as "One of the most brilliant of these carnivals ... for which the Bauhaus buildings were trans- formed into a fairy-tale vision at a time when nature lay locked in the relentless winter night . . Z'1 A newspaper account of 12 February 1929 recalls the scene: "Metal is hard. It is also sparkling and shiny. The festi- val last Saturday night proved to possess the latter qual- ities of metal . . . The party sparkled and shone, and yet was of such friendly gaiety and merriment, without ever getting out of hand in any way, that all partici- pants enjoyed it thoroughly. The entrance to the gaily decorated rooms was really ingenious. One entered the party via a chute that was built down from the connect- ing hallway between the two Bauhaus buildings . . . The rooms and studios of the two floors, which normally are used for serious work, had been decorated with the greatest variety of forms placed together all over the walls, shinily metallic and fairy-like, the ceilings hung with bizarre paper configurations . . ."2 Celebrating the gleam of metal, Metallisches Fest makes ref- erence to itself: to photography and the activity of photogra- phy. The animation and dynamism found in the reflection of the gazing ball that Grit Kallin-Fischer utilized as the center of her composition plays with and against the still-life whole. A celebration of the machine and a study of light and shad- ow, this ¡mage ¡s characteristic of the formal experimentation that Bauhaus students made with the camera. Mirrored and glass spheres, crystals, and mirrors found their way into a number of Bauhaus compositions. Immortalized in a photo- graph by Walter Funkat, a molecular assemblage of the spheres hung from the ceiling in one of the Dessau Bauhaus buildings. Similar subjects were photographed by "Bauhäuslers" George Muche (whose ¡mage appeared on the Stuttgart Film und Foto exhibition poster), Joost Schmidt, Lotte Stam-Beese, and Marianne Brandt. After leaving the Bauhaus, Kallin-Fischer worked as a com- mercial artist. In June 1930, a portfolio of advertising pho- tographs depicting cold creams, shoes, gloves, mirrors, belts, and ties in still-life arrangements was published in the influen- tial trade journal Gebrauchsgraphik. In 1931 Kallin-Fischer was included in the Foreign Advertising Photography exhibi- tion in New York. In addition to the skillful advertising pho- tographs, there also exists a number of portraits in the collec- tion of the Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin. In these, Kallin-Fischer employed bold chiaroscuro lighting and often photographed her subject in extreme close-up. In addition to advertising work, Kallin-Fischer's oeuvre consisted of transfer prints, pen- cil drawings, and paintings in gouache. A number of skillful- ly rendered portraits of her early pre-Bauhaus years are fol- lowed later by more loosely drawn figurative works and abstract compositions. A student of the painter Lovis Corinth from 1915 to 1917, Kallin-Fischer participated in Josef Albers's introductory course, the metal workshop of László Moholy-Nagy, and courses taught by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky at the Bauhaus Dessau from 1926 to 1928. In 1930 she assisted Oskar Schlemmer on theater sets in his workshop and pro- duced sketches of costume designs for the Bauhaus Theater. In 1 934, Kallin-Fischer emigrated to the United States with her second husband, Edward L. Fischer, who was a Bauhaus student from America. There, she remained in touch with her fellow "Bauhäuslers," Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, who collaborated in the design of the Fischers' house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

Museum Shop Fund 5:1994 In 1929, when Hannes Meyer became director of the Bauhaus, photography became an official and independent part of the curriculum. Prior to this time photography had been used in advertising design, illustration, and experimen- tal work. Private photography, that is to say the day to day recording of events and people, was also a common use for the medium, and that was where most of the stylistic experi- mentation occurred. The Bauhaus's introductory course (Vorkurs) used photography to investigate the effects of light and tonal values, and cyanotype photograms were part of the curricular exercises (Figure 7). Painter and graphic designer Fritz Kuhr was a student at the Bauhaus from 1923 to 1928. In 1923 Kuhr participated in the introductory course (Vorkurs) taught by László Moholy- Nagy. Moholy-Nagy's course concentrated on "organization in space," which consisted mainly of investigating the prop- erties of light and its ability to create form and space through the construction of sculptures made of glass and wood.1 These investigations were supplemented by the cre- ation of photograms where a two-dimensional plane could be made to appear as if it had depth through the skillful lay- ering of translucent materials on photographic paper. In 1929, Kuhr participated in the photography course that was given by Walter Peterhans. According to Kuhr, Peterhans was a very fastidious instructor relying much on indecipherable mathematical equations. One of Kuhr's pho- tographs was included in a portfolio of student work put together for Peterhans in 1 929, his first year at the Bauhaus. Kuhr's work demonstrates a sustained interest in photography Figure 7 Heinrich Bormann German, 1909-1982 Exposure Test, from the Albers Vorkurs, c. 1930 cyanotype Collection of the Bauhaus-Archiv Berlin, inv. nr. 101 24 Reproduction photograph by Markus Hawlik and was extensive enough for him to have contributed a selection of six photographs to the important 1929 Film und Foto exhibition. Still, the main body of his work was in paint- ing - figurative, abstract, and nonobjective. In Cyanotype Photogram, a fine example of Bauhaus experi- mentation, Kuhr takes abstraction to the level of nonobjective representation. The photogram recalls the later compositions of Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, both of whom Kuhr cites as great inspirations in the development of his work. In Cyanotype Photogram, Kuhr creates the effect of a celestial pattern through his use of varying planar depths and textural effects. The inspiration of Moholy-Nagy seems evident not only in Cyanotype Photogram and other abstract pho- tographs by Kuhr published in the Bauhaus magazine of 1929, but also in his photographs of the late 1950s. All reveal his interest in the interplay of light and shadow and in texture. In 1937 Kuhr's work was included in the infamous Nazi Degenerate Art exhibition, making it impossible for him to paint for the balance of the Nazi regime.2 In 1943 and 1 944, Kuhr's studio was bombed and all of his work destroyed; consequently, works predating 1937 are very rare.

Museum Shop Fund 26:1995 Photographer, philosopher, aesthete, mathematician, geome- ter, and educator, Walter Peterhans has been placed by scholars among the most eminent photographers of the New Objectivity movement. Peterhans was the official course leader of the photography section of the Bauhaus established in 1929. Previously, the medium had been integrated into various other course studies, like the Vorkurs (preliminary course) or the advertising section. Peterhans's technical virtu- osity and clarity of vision were appropriate for the artistic cli- mate during second director Hannes Meyer's tenure. Meyer directed the Bauhaus away from expressionism and towards practical and commercial production ventures. Peterhans's enlistment was one of the results of Meyer's acts of renewal. Creating tableaux of formal perfection with objets trouvés, Peterhans employed Emmanuel Kant's Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, Plato's theory of knowledge and education laid out in Meno, and the geometric axioms of Pythagoras. Inspired by Kant, Peterhans formulated his own theory, stat- ing that "we evaluate the beauty of an object in nature according to whether or not it agrees with the harmonic order proposed to her, merely imagined, or executed as a work of art."1 This understanding of beauty as a "consum- mated unity" that is constructed by the human mind and expressed in works of art was at the heart of Peterhans's imagemaking as well as his teaching philosophy. Hommage à Rimbaud ou Ophelia is a classic Peterhans composition exemplifying his role as the "great tabulator or law giver" who created arrangements that floated and scintillated in their formal balance. One of Peterhans's finest works, Hommage à Rimbaud ou Ophelia brings together the organ- ic qualities and spiritual capacities of beautiful objects with the cultural inspiration of mathematical precision. An exacting instructor and photographer, Peterhans worked with large-format cameras. He was very particular about lighting and composition. He would shift his lights and objects a millimeter or two one way or the other for hours on end.2 Interestingly, Peterhans signed the St. Louis version of Hommage à Rimbaud ou Ophelia upside-down, creating an entirely new design. According to scholar Inka Graeve, Peterhans did sometimes change his mind regarding the ori- entation of a print.3 Hommage à Rimbaud ou Ophelia com- plements a wonderful still life in the museum's collection by Bauhaus students Ringl and Pit (Ellen Auerbach and Grete Stern), to whom Peterhans sold his studio in 1930. Peterhans was the son of the director of Zeiss-lkon AG, a company known for its precision lenses. He studied at the Academy of Graphic Art and Book Publishing in Leipzig and supplemented his education by studying philosophy, art histo- ry, and mathematics. These initial influences laid the ground- work for his interest in the clear and objective rendering of his subjects. Peterhans was already an established and well- respected commercial photographer when he was appointed head of the photographic workshop at the Bauhaus in 1929. Opposing the subjectivism of Moholy-Nagy, Peterhans brought to the Bauhaus the other important artistic philoso- phy of the time, New Objectivity. His ¡mages provided a visual precision that was based on mathematics rather than Utopianism. Peterhans's pedagogy was translated into an important course in visual training at the Armour Institute in Chicago (later the Illinois Institute of Technology), where he emigrated in 1 938.

Museum Shop Fund 7:1987 During the 1920s and 1930s, advertising in Germany sup- ported a Utopian vision of the modern world. There was an increase in visual statements that integrated new forms of typography and design. The team of Ringl and Pit tapped into the burgeoning market, employing a New Vision aes- thetic. Named after Auerbach and Stern's childhood nick- names, the ringl + pit studio produced photographs that emphasized the primacy of the ¡mage by integrating text and typography to form a unified whole. Stern was born in Wupperthal-Elberfeld, and Auerbach was raised in Karlsruhe. They led parallel lives, studying art in nearby academies and moving to Berlin in their early twen- ties to study with Walter Peterhans. Stern came to Berlin in 1928, a year before Peterhans became head of the photog- raphy section of the Bauhaus, then in Dessau. Auerbach met Stern at Peterhans's studio in 1 929; they quickly found they shared common interests. Grete Stern continued her visual education with Peterhans at the Bauhaus until 1930, when Peterhans became tired of the commute from Dessau to his Berlin studio and sold the business to Stern. Auerbach and Stern became partners and the two completed commissions for a variety of clients including cigarette manufacturers, dis- tributors of petroleum products, textile manufacturers, and cosmetics companies. Their style was imaginative, tinged with humor and a note of surrealism. Although they worked as a team, Auerbach emphasized the "persona I ¡ty" of their sub- jects, often adding a touch of humor, while Stern, the more objective photographer, gave them their concrete presence.1 In 1931, Traugott Schalcher praised Auerbach and Stern for their skill in rendering the "delicate nuances of textiles."2 Silks, made by Stern after her emigration to London, is an excellent example. There is a sensual, almost sunlit glow to the image. Stern's use of lighting nevertheless creates a sense of the object - of its three-dimensionality and its occu- pation of space. The glowing light employed by the ringl + pit studio in their photographs is very similar to the quality of light found in the still lifes of Walter Peterhans. Shalcher's article, which featured eleven ringl + pit ¡mages, undoubtedly provided exposure to the studio that would have resulted in commissions.3 Unfortunately, the political climate was about to boil over. On their way to a successful busi- ness, Auerbach and Stern were forced to close the ringl + pit studio in 1933, having received tips about their imminent danger. Stern recalls, "We were informed. Our left-wing friends were aware. They knew when somebody had disap- peared. We didn't want to wait until someone came into our house."* In 1933, Stern moved to London before the terror escalated. Auerbach also fled Germany in 1933 to open her own stu- dio in Palestine. At the outbreak of the Palestinian war in 1 935, Auerbach was called to London by Stern, where they continued their collaboration until Auerbach left for the United States and Stern left for Argentina. Silks, signed by Stern and annotated with the signature "ringl + pit," was made in London in 1934 before Auerbach came to London. Stern continued to use the name "ringl + pit" for her studio in London.

Museum Shop Fund 101:1982 "The best school in Germany is definitely Hans Finsler's class at the Werkstatten Burg Giebichstein School of Arts. Finsler's own achievements as well as those of his students are of great importance. It is fitting to apply the words of Van Gogh who said that it is more impor- tant to have feeling for the subject than a virtuosity for the medium."1 - Carl Georg Heise From 1922 to 1932, Hans Finsler taught art history at the Werkstatten Burg Giebichenstein School of Arts and Crafts in Halle, Germany, where he was also librarian. In 1926 he established a course in object photography to coincide with the school's new advertising workshop. This course was one of the few of its kind. Other important photography pro- grams were at the Bauhaus, headed by Walter Peterhans, and at the Folkwang School in Essen, spearheaded by Max Burchartz and Albert Renger-Patzsch. A self-taught photogra- pher, Finsler studied art history with Heinrich Wolfflin, whose analytic and systematic way of looking at art is said to have inspired Finsler's keen and precise photographic sensibility. Finsler's work was primarily in commercial advertising pho- tography, where Finsler produced striking compositions that evoked the modern spirit. His first experiments with photogra- phy were made with eggs as his subject. Wanting a simple object whose surface could be evenly lit, he photographed eggs singly and in groups on white and black backgrounds in order to find the most accurate representation of the egg's form. This investigation was soon continued with the more complex forms found in utensils and tools, pots and pans, and furniture. In these strong objective ¡mages Finsler com- bined form and function with technical virtuosity, making the surfaces of glass, metal, and porcelain "sing" in their articu- lated precision. Clear and direct, these photographs are evocative of the modern German interest in economic design and precision of function. Finsler was well respected in the field, as his thirty-seven contributions to the Film und Foto exhibition demonstrate. Ashtray Cigarette Composition is a fine example of Finsler's virtuosity in combining the subtlety of white on white surfaces with commanding compositional form. The photograph was made for the Staatliche Porzellan Manufaktur (State Porcelain Manufacturers) in Berlin. In 1929, the director of the compa- ny commissioned Marguerite Friedlaender, who was head of the porcelain workshop at the Halle school, to create mod- ern, functional tableware. This commission successfully merged the school's creative abilities with the factory's practi- cal capabilities. The school's workshop produced prototype pieces which were then tested for their mass-productibility. Like the Bauhaus, the Halle school collaborated with manu- facturing companies to produce textiles, ceramics, advertis- ing designs, and metalwork. Finsler photographed these items for both the school and the manufacturers. Innovative visual compositions were sought by manufacturing and mar- keting agencies who wanted to evoke the modern spirit of the times. This spirit is emphasized on a label on the verso of Ashtray Cigarette Composition which reads: "Porcelain for the new home: Ashtrays." Finsler left Halle in 1932 to head the newly established pho- tography class at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich, which was modeled in the spirit of the New Objectivity. He brought to Switzerland the first organized school of photographic study, which produced a number of distinguished alumni, among them Werner Bischof and Renée Burri. Consistently strong, precise, and lovingly rendered, Finsler's large body of work speaks of a commitment to objective beauty.

Museum Shop Fund 1 02: 1 982 Considered one of the leading figures in Modernist Czech photography, Adolph Schneeberger, like Jaromir Funke and Joseph Sudek, was a member of the Czech Club of Amateur Photographers (cesky klub fotografi) amatérú, or CKFA) in Prague. Although they were primarily repositories for tradi- tional photography which at the time championed the Pictorialist style, amateur photographic clubs underwent a number of secessions in the early 1920s that were prompted by ideological clashes. These clubs played an integral role in the development of avant-garde Czech photography, their upheavals and secessions serving to crystallize a number of photographic movements from Modernism to Poetism. Schneeberger and Funke were two of the major participants in these clubs and their advanced ideas, which embraced the modern European ideologies of Constructivism and Functionalism (the European term for "International Style" fos- tered by the Bauhaus), had an enormous influence on the development of Czech photography. Schneeberger was an advocate of straight photography, and although his early work was heavily romanticized through the use of soft focus, he did not manipulate his negatives or prints. Schneeberger's subjects were also atypical: he made social statements by turning his camera to street workers and the destitute. Schneeberger's work recalled aspects of the international Pictorialist aesthetic until 1930, when his inter- est shifted to dynamic compositions that utilized the unusual viewpoints of Russian Constructivism and Functionalism. Figure 8 Adolph Schneeberger Exhibition Poster for the Czech Club for Amateur Photographers, 1 93 1 The sharp focus, brilliant lighting, and repetition of objects evident in Spool Composition recall New Objectivity and Bauhaus compositions, while the strong diagonal stripes cast from the shadows of the spools and the balanced composi- tion reflect his interest in the geometric order of Constructivism. The shadows of Schneeberger's subject become as material as the spools themselves, creating a tri- partite level of dimensionality. Schneeberger often made use of shadows in his compositions, constructing ¡mages that were at once diffuse and tangible. A variant of Spool Composition was used by Schneeberger in 1931 as an illustration for a CKFA exhibition poster, where he also incorporated a negative print with text (Figure 8). The incorporation of text and photography, gar- nered from Functionalist designs, had also taken root in Czech design during the mid-to-late 1920s. Referring to the process of photography, Spool Composition is a classic example of Modernist formalism, reflecting the spirit of the machine age, new technology, and the new vision.

Museum Shop Fund 37:1985 The Czechoslovakian state, founded in 1918 after the col- lapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, quickly developed a fertile cultural and artistic scene. This included the develop- ment of Devetsil, a left-wing group of avant-garde artists, architects, and literary figures who drew on the cultural events of Moscow, Paris, Warsaw, Budapest, and the Bauhaus in Germany. Although not an official member of the group, Funke nevertheless was sympathetic towards their ide- ologies. Cubism, Futurism, and Dadaism as well as Russian Constructivism formed the foundation of this burgeoning new artistic spirit. Film and photography also played a major role in the artistic investigations of Devetsil, as well as those of Funke, one of the most influential Czech photographers work- ing between the wars. A writer, critic, and curator as well as a photographer, Funke's work influenced the Czech vision. He bridged the gap between the amateur salons and the rev- olutionary avant-garde, acknowledging the importance of the representation of the state at international photographic salons, which were still havens for the status quo. In the 1920s, many influences were entering the country through journals and avant-garde groups, and Funke naturally devel- oped an awareness of Surrealism, New Objectivity, and Constructivism, from which he drew subtle inspiration. In 1922, he began his long investigation of the still life. Combining transparent materials in the darkroom, such as glass with varying tones of paper, these works gave the effect of unlimited space. Funke also experimented with pho- tograms, but was ultimately opposed to camera-less photog- raphy, stating that there was no photography without a neg- ative and camera.1 This purist opinion caused a break between Funke and the Devetsil, who approved of highly manipulated imagery. In Funke's works of the 1920s, he continued his spatial inves- tigations by examining the effects of light and shadow in compositions that used shadows from objects beyond the frame, thus eliminating the concrete object. Completed between the years 1926 and 1929, Funke's shadow plays are among his most lyrical works. In 1927 and 1928 he brought his shadow investigations to maturity in compositions with mirrors and bottles. Combining the "shadow plays'7 with his earlier investigations of the still life, Funke created com- plex spatial arrangements. Mirror Bottle Abstraction is one from this series. In this photograph, Funke combines an aspect of Surrealism, that of a poetic alternate reality. Funke's bottle shadows could be regarded as the shadows of figures, moving through a carnival landscape of mirrors and walls. He further exploited the technique of the shadow play in his collaborations with architect and scenographer Zdenék Rossman, producing stage projections that created shadows resembling a primeval forest. Born in Skutec in 1896, Funke studied medicine, law, and then aesthetics in Prague, before becoming enamored with photography. In 1 920 he became a member of the photog- raphy club in Prague as well as a number of other photo- graphic associations. Funke was a critic and theoretician. His criticism of the travelling portfolio of the Photo Club Prague (Foto klubu Praha), of which he, Adolph Schneeberger, and Joseph Sudek were members, was instru- mental in their disbarrment from the organization. Although his work has not been as well known as that of his friend and colleague Joseph Sudek, Funke was one of the most influential photographers in Czechoslovakia. It was probably his early death in 1945 that prevented Funke from becoming as well known as Sudek. An active artist until his death, Funke has left behind a body of work strong in both techni- cal skill and cerebral depth.

Museum Shop Fund 61:1989 Born in New York City in 1 893, Florence Henri was raised in Europe. As a child, she studied the piano and demonstrat- ed a proficiency for drawing. Stranded in Berlin at the out- break of World War I, Henri benefited from the city's dynamic artistic community. She moved to Paris in 1924, studying painting with Andre L'hote and Fernand Léger. The subjects that she explored in her early works were true to the modern spirit and celebrated the city and the machine. Her paintings owed much to her mentor Léger and to Purism, Constructivism, and Cubism. In 1927 Henri enrolled at the Bauhaus as an unmatriculated student. By 1928, her focus had shifted from painting to pho- tography, and she began to make portraits and still lifes using mirrors and small props such as chrome balls. For Henri, photography allowed the most lucid translation of her ideas into a visual expression, and she quickly mastered the medium. In 1929, Henri's photographs were included in two seminal photographic exhibitions: Fotografie der Gegenwart (Contemporary Photography) and the international Film und Foto exhibition, which included twenty-one of Henri's images. Henri's work during the next few years was primarily photo- graphic yet grounded in her earlier interests in Purism and Constructivism. Her use of mirrors in the still lifes she pro- duced in the late 1920s challenged and distorted both space and perspective, recalling her interest in Cubism. In Figure 9a Nature Morte Composition, 1 93 1 gelatin silver print Figure 9b Composition Abstraite, 1 93 1 gelatin silver print Both images in the Collection of Musée National d'Art Moderne - Centre Georges Pompidou - Paris 1930 and 1931, Henri began to incorporate organic ele- ments into her ¡mages with the linear geometry created by the mirrors, offering a harmonious relationship between nature and culture. After World War I, artists had rejected references to the natural world and preferred instead to cele- brate the logic of a technological world. By the late 1920s, however, the alienating and dehumanizing force of technolo- gy and the machine were already being expressed, and there came a newfound appreciation of man's place within the natural world. Henri's use of flowers and fruit in still lifes, as seen in Still Life with Roses, signals the acceptance of nature as an artistic subject. Henri often used the same elements in more than one still-life composition. She also built up ¡mages by adding or subtract- ing elements while she recorded each new manifestation. Variants in the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou demonstrate this genesis (Figures 9a and 9b). In these still-life compositions, Henri created a unique visual sensibility that successfully joined principles of Cubism and Constructivism with references to the natural world.

Museum Shop Fund 5:1996 In 1923, the painter Fernand Léger began work on Ballet Mécanique, a film that extended his investigations of machine imagery and everyday objects. Collaborating with the cameraman and director Dudley Murphy,1 and with ini- tial input from the poet Ezra Pound and the photographer Man Ray, Léger utilized ¡mages ¡n Ballet Mécanique that he had already treated ¡n paintings: people and objects of mod- ern life. Léger felt that film was a natural medium with which to further explore these themes. Léger became fascinated with film at a time when his interest began to shift towards everyday objects as subject matter. He hoped to utilize the medium to find the "exact sense of useful realities/7 while reaching a larger, more diversified audience.2 Léger felt the popularity of film made it an ¡deal medium with which to reach the masses. Although Ballet Mécanique only enjoyed a modest attendance, exclusively in avant-garde circles, Léger was still excited by the medium's potential. He was no stranger to theatrical expression. Throughout his career, Léger completed many set designs for film, theatre, and ballet, satisfying his fascination for specta- cle. Indeed, the musical score for the film was to be made by the avant-garde composer George Antheil, whose score was to include such unconventional instruments as machines, bells, anvils, and automobile horns.3 Ballet Mécanique ¡s a dynamic combination of images from modern life woven together in a rhythmic dance. Léger inter- cut sequences that included a girl on a swing, Christmas decorations, prismatically fractured household objects, the face and lips of the artist's model Kiki of Montparnasse, a rapidly pumping piston, a close-up of a machine in motion, and numerous other everyday objects and people, including the ¡mage of Dudley Murphy seen in the St. Louis still, into what would be a plotless film. "No scenario - reactions of rhythmic ¡mages that is all/' Léger declared.4 The prismatic effect employed in various parts of the film Ballet Mécanique, such as in the ¡mage of Dudley Murphy featured here, was created through the use of a "vorto- scope," a type of kaleidoscope that used a series of mirrors to refract light and fragment ¡mages. The same technique was first utilized by the photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn in the late 1910s to create a series of images, which his friend Ezra Pound dubbed "vortographs" (see page 3). Pound was also a collaborator on Ballet Mécanique, creat- ing a link between Vorticism and the Parisian avant-garde.5 The Surrealist Man Ray was also involved in the early days of filming; his rayographs were the inspiration for the abstracted ¡mages in the film. In this carefully mounted and trimmed vintage still photo- graph from Ballet Mécanique, which Léger signed and gave to his friend the photographer Jean Roubier,6 shafts of scintil- lating light emanate from around Murphy's head, creating a sense of fractured time and space. Although it is a still ¡mage, it nevertheless retains the sense of movement that is the key to the film.

Rudolph E. Kuenzli (New York: Willis Locker and Owens, 1987), 33. 4 Ibid., 38. 5 Ibid., 33. 6 The fact that Léger signed the print would seem to suggest that the pho- tograph was meant to be an "independent work." However, because the film was a collaborative effort between a number of artists, a question of attribution is raised. Léger scholar Judy Freeman suggests that the shot may be by Man Ray or another cameraman. The ¡mage is similar in char- acter to a larger extant still photograph of Kiki of Montparnasse from the film which Man Ray claimed as his own (according to a letter to the author from scholar Judi Freeman dated 21 March 1996). 60</page><page sequence="63">61</page><page sequence="64">SUGGESTED READINGS GENERAL LITERATURE Bauhaus-Archiv.
