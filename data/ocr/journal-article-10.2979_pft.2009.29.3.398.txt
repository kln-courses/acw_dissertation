<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> y 398  Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism D o n  S e e m A n A b S t r A c t In the year 1820, Rabbi Menahem Mendl Schneerson’s youngest son Moshe  converted to Christianity. Seven years later, Moshe’s older brother Dov Ber (who  had by now become leader of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement) devoted the last  public discourse of his life to the apostasy of Jewish boys conscripted by the Russian  army. Clearly, this essay was offered as a response to the deep sense of crisis that had  settled upon Russian Jewry due to the recent passage of the infamous “cantoniza- tion” decree, which imposed harsh quotas for the conscription of Jewish boys at very  young ages, and supplemented their twenty-five years of mandatory military  service with additional years of training under harsh conditions and heavy  conversionary pressure. Yet I believe it can be shown that the essay “Lekiÿat ’anshe  ÿayil” (On the Conscription of Jewish Soldiers) was also written in response to the  apostasy by R. Dov Ber’s own brother. He sought to explain in Hasidic terms not  just how the unthinkable act of conversion came about but also how the mechanics  of redemption could render even this catastrophe somehow meaning ful. In cultural  poetic terms, R. Dov Ber’s essay calls attention to the close relationship between  mystical and everyday responses to social suffering, and to the complex interplay of  literary concerns and ritual efficacy in Jewish mystical writing. My analysis calls  for a broader and more culturally attuned understanding of what properly  constitutes “Jewish literature,” and for a renewed engagement with the question of  how different kinds of literature can act upon or within the social world. As a theory of meaning, Kabbalah tells us that meaning is the hurt, that meaning itself is hurtful.     —Harold Bloom, Kabbalah and Criticism Religious theories that emphasize meaning focus on the end-product, a  story that is said to link heaven and earth, but the stability and solidity of  this dissolves if you focus instead on the processes of religious meaning- PROOFTEXTS 29 (2009): 398–432.

What we see if we do this is the wounding; in this devotional  world, as in others, meaning-making is wounding.     —Robert Orsi, Between Heaven and Earth:    The Religious Worlds People Make and the People Who Study Them Literary practice relates not only to the aesthetic and ideological themes of literature, but also to the production and management of emotional states that have ritual or political consequences in lived experience. One thinks  of the way in which certain kinds of nationalist or Zionist literature—Bialik’s  poem “The City of Slaughter” is a good example—worked to promote and legiti- mize politically actionable sentiments like outrage against gentile violence, while  also marginalizing traditional ritual (“quietistic”) expressions of grief and lamen- tation.1 One also thinks of the ways in which nineteenth- and early twentieth- century autobiographers in both Jewish and non-Jewish contexts struggled to  articulate new relationships between gender, emotion, and modern individualism.2  Because of their explicit interest in shaping the way people perceive and respond to  the world (and their constant reinforcement through ritual), Jewish mystical texts  provide one of the most powerful examples of how literature helps to shape and  manage distinctive forms of human subjectivity. My article analyzes an early  Hasidic text whose explicit theme is the apostasy of Jews in the Russian army, but  which also seeks to redefine Jews’ relationship with the state, with the cosmos, and  with their brothers who have committed the religiously unthinkable act of  converting to the religion of the oppressor.  Rabbi Dov Ber Schneersohn’s discourse “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” (On the  Conscription of Jewish Soldiers) was first delivered orally in Yiddish (then written  and disseminated in Hebrew) in December 1827.3 In August of that year, Tsar  Nicholas I had issued an edict requiring all Jewish communities to fill strict quotas  of male conscripts for the Russian army. While Jewish men between the ages of  eighteen and twenty-five were now subject to up to twenty-five years of military  service, boys from the age of twelve were also subject to be drafted into “cantons”  for military training and “Russification,” which was often perceived as a process of  forced assimilation and conversion to Christianity. In practice, even boys as young  as eight or nine were often seized. This was the context in which R. Dov Ber’s  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="3"> 400 y    Don Seeman essay on Jewish conscription sought to promote the management of grief or sorrow  as a distinctive religious emotion that might sustain or rectify the broken cosmos.  In pointed opposition to Bialik’s “City of Slaughter,” for example, which later  became a focal point for Jewish political responses to antisemitism, “On the  Conscription of Jewish Soldiers” argued for a metaphysical and sorrow-driven,  ritual response to the gathering terrors of modernity faced by European Jews.  Understanding a text like this one necessitates a view of Hasidic writing as  the discursive or literary pole of a much broader continuum that includes ritual  and bodily practices of other kinds. Together, these literary and ritual interven- tions are aimed at shifting the whole embodied habitus of relations between the  human and the divine.4 This is what Hasidic writers mean when they talk about  the ‘avodah (ritual-work or devotional practice) of the Hasidic devotee, which  almost always includes the reading and writing of sacred texts alongside other  kinds of ritual and devotional practice.5 Such activities help to train the human  personality for divine service, but they are also said to channel blessing and vitality  into the world that human beings inhabit: “to draw the revelation of the light of  ’En Sof downwards, to create a habitation in the lower worlds . . . through the posi- tive and negative commandments.”6 In this framework, the discursive elaboration  of religious doctrines or ideas may only be secondary to a much broader goal,  which includes literal transformation of the human and natural worlds. “On the  Conscription of Jewish Soldiers” is no exception. It was one of the first in an  ongoing tradition of Hasidic literature—especially in Habad Hasidism—that  offered direct mystical responses to current events and dilemmas with which the  Jewish community was confronted.7 It sought not just to inform readers but also to  help mediate between literary practice, personal grief, and the awful contingencies  of Jewish life in tsarist Russia.  “ o n  t H e  c o n S c r i P t i o n  o f  J e w i S H  S o L D i e r S ” Rabbi Dov Ber Schneersohn of Lubavitch (1773–1827) was the eldest son of R.  Shneur Zalman of Liadi (ca. 1745–1813), the founder of the Habad Lubavitch  movement and author of Likkutei ’amarim tanya.8 R. Dov Ber was also the winner  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="4"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  401 in a protracted controversy with one of his father’s leading disciples over the lead- ership of the nascent dynasty after Shneur Zalman died.9 R. Dov Ber’s discourse  “On the Conscription of Jewish Soldiers” (“Inyan lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” in Hebrew)  was delivered during the month of Kislev 5588 (December 1827), only a week or  so before the author’s own death at the age of fifty-four.10 It was a short discourse  (only twelve pages of text in a recent printed edition), yet it builds quickly toward  a comprehensive argument about the relationship between grief, ritual efficacy,  and the apostasy of Jewish conscripts serving in the Russian army. The burden of  R. Dov Ber’s argument is that grief over the deepening exile of the Jewish people  is paradoxically the source of a sustaining spiritual power; that the “evil decrees”  of the gentiles (i.e., the Russian government) are in reality divine decrees; and  most importantly, that the apostasy of many young Jews in the Russian army was  the result of a metaphysical winnowing process called birur, which is the painful  yet necessary engine of Jewish redemptive history. Readers who focus only on the  technical kabbalistic infrastructure of this essay may, however, miss the extraordi- nary pathos that helps to drive it forward. I will argue that the essay was actually  written in the shadow of R. Dov Ber’s grief over the conversion to Christianity by  his own younger brother Moshe seven years earlier, and that traces of this crisis are  still discernible in “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil.” Moshe was the youngest of R. Shneur Zalman’s three sons.11 In 1812, the  “Alter Rebbe” (R. Shneur Zalman) threw his prestige behind the Russian war  effort against Napoleon and was forced to flee under Russian military escort from  advancing Napoleonic forces. His headlong flight across the Russian hinterland  saved him from Napoleon but did not leave him unscathed; he fell ill and died in  the town of Haditz in 1813. Moreover, his youngest son Moshe was captured and  condemned to be executed as a Russian spy. While there is no direct evidence to  support this accusation, it is worth noting that tales circulate to this day in Habad  circles about Hasidim who did in fact spy for the tsar against Napoleon.12 However  oppressive, tsarist rule was attributed a divine mandate by early Habad sources,  while the emancipation promised by Napoleon was feared as a harbinger of assim- ilation and spiritual collapse.13  Moshe’s life was ultimately spared when his captors decided that he was  mentally unstable, but this was far from the end of his odyssey. With R. Shneur  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="5"> 402 y    Don Seeman Zalman gone and Moshe now struggling with what appears to have been a long- standing mental illness, R. Dov Ber worked hard to consolidate the Hasidim under  his own leadership, and to face down challenges from his father’s one-time student,  R. Aharon Horowitz. R. Dov Ber moved to the town of Lubavitch, which would  remain the center of Habad Hasidism until 1915. Moshe, meanwhile, was married  to the daughter of one of his father’s followers and installed as the rabbi of the  town of Ulla. Although many details of what came next have been forgotten or  suppressed, historian David Assaf has argued on the basis of newly available  Russian documents that Moshe converted to Christianity not once but twice,  beginning in the Hebrew month of Av 1820.14  It is hardly surprising that the story of Moshe’s apostasy would be downplayed  by later Hasidic figures.15 It was, however, amplified by Maskilic writers who were  intent on using the episode to discredit Hasidism. One common (but unsupported)  legend had it that Moshe’s conversion was related to an inheritance and leadership  dispute between Moshe and his brothers.16 “When a goy is the Rebbe,” Peretz  Smolenskin wrote disparagingly, then “the Rebbe must become a goy.”17 Russian  archival materials show that Moshe’s conversion to Catholicism was officially  contested by his brothers on grounds of mental illness and other irregularities.18  While the case was being investigated, he was returned for a time (by government  order) to his family, where he also expressed interest in converting to Russian  Orthodoxy. At one point during this protracted controversy, he was sent to a  hospital for observation, which is where the documentary trail concerning his case  ends.19 It is unclear from documentary evidence whether Moshe actually died as a  convert or became a wandering ascetic penitent as some Hasidic sources suggest,  but his story is germane to a reading of R. Dov Ber’s essay on the conscription of  Jewish soldiers for at least two reasons.20 First, on the purely thematic level, it is  hard to imagine that a gifted Hasidic thinker like R. Dov Ber could have composed  a discourse on the apostasy of Jewish boys without somehow relating this theme to  his own family’s bitter experience with conversion. Assaf has shown that in addi- tion to interceding with civil authorities on his brother’s behalf, R. Dov Ber also  continued to support Moshe’s wife and children, who ascended to the holy city of  Hebron with other Habad Hasidim in 1843.21  There is also some textual evidence that R. Dov Ber had Moshe’s conversion  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="6"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  403 in mind when he composed his later essay on Jewish conscripts. At least two of the  essay’s extant manuscripts tell us that when R. Dov Ber began his oral discourse on  Jewish conscripts in 1827, he told the gathered Hasidim that he had prophesied  the tsar’s decree seven years earlier, in 1820: I knew about this [decree] seven years ago, when I was upon the grave of  my father and master. . . . I saw then a great accuser against the youth of  the haters of Israel (according to the secret of “a tzaddik will fall seven  times and then the decree will arise”) and my spirit broke within me  because I knew and understood that this would certainly come to pass in  time.22 The “youth of the haters of Israel” is just a euphemism for Jewish youth, and an  “accuser” is the standard rabbinic personification of an evil decree. More interesting  here is the paraphrase of an obscure mystical expression, tzaddik yipol sheva ve-kam,  “a righteous person will fall seven times and then arise,” which is based on Proverbs  24:16. The simplest meaning of the verse is that a tzaddik or righteous person can  “fall” many times, but will always find a way to rise again.23 Yet the Baal Shem Tov  inflects the expression somewhat differently, as proof that even a tzaddik (the  common term for a Hasidic leader) can fall. This is reminiscent of contemporary  letters that depict R. Dov Ber “weeping bitterly” for his brother who had “fallen.”24  More suggestive still is another teaching attributed to the Baal Shem Tov, which is  that tzaddik yipol sheva refers to the pain caused to a righteous man by the sins of his  son, whose essence is emanated (through all seven sefirot) from his father’s thought.25  In this reading, the tzaddik troubled by the deeds of the son would be R. Shneur  Zalman, which might also explain why R. Dov Ber associates this teaching with a  visit to his father’s grave in 1820—and why he speaks about it seven years later in  such guarded terms, touching as it does on his father’s honor.  Michael Stanislawski has noted that one of the characteristic responses to the  threat posed by the tsar’s 1827 edict was an increase in visits to cemeteries for the  sake of intercession by important ancestors and rabbis.26 R. Dov Ber himself was  the author of a mystical tract on the Hasidic practice of prostration upon the graves  of tzaddikim for the attainment of prophecy and annulment of evil decrees.27 Jews  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="7"> 404 y    Don Seeman had been working for years to try to forestall or frustrate the tsar’s conscription  policy, mostly through bribes to various officials, so it is conceivable that this was  already on R. Dov Ber’s mind when he visited his father’s grave in 1820. It is more  likely, however, that he was “upon his father’s grave” that year seeking intercession  against Moshe’s apostasy. The reference to visiting his father’s grave in 1820 is  oblique, but could hardly have been missed by listeners who knew the family’s  recent troubled history. The personal tragedy of the tzaddik—who may be R. Dov  Ber, Moshe, or R. Shneur Zalman, depending on how one reads this passage— must now be read as a cipher and an omen for what would soon befall the Jewish  community as a whole. Nor would it have escaped notice in 1827 that Moshe’s  apostasy and the tsar’s decree both took place during the Hebrew month of Av,  which is by long tradition set aside for collective mourning over the Temple’s  destruction, and described in some sources as an inauspicious time for Jews to have  dealings with gentiles.28 Forced and essentially open-ended military service for  young conscripts was viewed as a shattering catastrophe by most Jews, and it is  easy to see why only a metaphysical response may have seemed equal to the need  which this policy evoked.  In Western Europe, military conscription was frequently considered a path to  emancipation and greater rights for Jews, but in Russia, where emancipation was  out of the question, conscription was widely considered little more than “a puni- tive measure to help reduce the size of the Jewish population, to make it pay up tax  arrears, or to force it to take up agricultural pursuits.”29 The so-called rekrutshchina  decree was one of the new tsar’s first orders of business upon ascending the throne  because he believed so strongly that conscription was the solution to the many  social problems afflicting his empire.30 A memorandum to Nicholas from an  officer of the secret police declared quite plainly that “the chief benefit to be  derived from the drafting of Jews is certainly that it will move them most effec- tively to change their religion.”31 Jews and some artisan groups had previously been  able to avoid the draft through payment of a special tax, but now they were reduced,  in Stanislawski’s words, to a “lowest common denominator of rightlessness.”32  Even worse than the legal cantonization of twelve-year-old boys, however, was  the illegal but frequent abduction of children as young as eight or nine years old by  Jewish khappers (“grabbers”) who were hired to find replacements for conscripts from  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="8"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  405 more affluent families.33 Poor families might, in any case, choose to sacrifice a  younger son rather than an older brother who already had a wife and children to  support. The horrors visited upon such small children included severe deprivation  and heavy conversionary pressure as well as physical violence, which included beat- ings, being held underwater, and being force-fed salty fish.34 Of 70,000 Jewish  conscripts between 1827 and 1854, some 50,000 are estimated to have been chil- dren.35 It is also thought that about half of these died from privation, beating, and  the elements before they ever saw military service, and there are accounts of suicides  among conscripts to avoid forced baptism.36 Jewish communal authority was severely  shaken over time by the perception of corruption and cruelty with which the poor  and indigent—and possibly kofrim or “heretics”—were singled out for capture as the  Jewish community struggled to meet its harsh, state-imposed quota.37  In the short term, Jews responded with expressions of panic and communal  mourning as well as religious revival, all of which helped to set the stage for R.  Dov Ber’s essay. “All artisans’ shops were abandoned, no [wedding] matches were  made, and many were broken off. Many Jews prepared to go to Palestine, others  rushed to join the merchant guilds,” writes Stanislawski. “A cripple was considered  a saved man, an only son a joy, a hunchback an aristocrat.”38 Traditional responses  like prayer, fasting, and charity also increased, as did the enrollment of boys in  heder (religious schools).39 One community went so far as to place a written appeal  in the hands of a dead man before burial, to deliver to his righteous ancestors on  the other side.40 Yet despite this air of increasing desperation, there was little in  the way of literary response at this point to the tsar’s decree. Adina Ofek has  shown that little was written about the problem of the “cantonists” by Haskalah  writers before 1834, possibly because some writers felt constrained from criticizing  the Russian government because of their support for what they still perceived as  positive reformist policies enacted by the tsar.41 Writers like Isaac B. Levinsohn  devoted themselves in satire and polemic to the cruelty of the Jewish communities  who applied the conscription decree, while simultaneously trying to absolve the  tsar himself from blame.42 This should be contrasted with R. Dov Ber’s essay,  which makes no mention of Jewish complicity in the draft and even portrays non- Jewish actors primarily as blind instruments of the divine decree.43 The attribution  of agency—and hence moral responsibility—for the situations in which Jews found  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="9"> 406 y    Don Seeman themselves was perhaps the defining ideological struggle over the shape of Jewish  modernity during this period. Hasidic tradition maintains that grief over the fate of Jewish conscripts “broke  [R. Dov Ber’s] heart,” and sent him to an early grave.44 Yet it must be emphasized  that the theological problem to which he addressed himself in the essay before us  was not really the suffering faced by individual boys or their families. He mentions  the conscription of Jewish soldiers only near the end of the text and then obliquely,  in asking why there are some conscripts who “never would have exchanged their  religion had they remained among Jews, but who apostatize among them [i.e.,  while serving in the Russian army].” He seems as unconcerned with the religious  choices of individual conscripts or apostates as he is with individual gentile rulers,  but is deeply troubled by a situation in which the divine will itself seems to decree  a situation in which apostasy will be difficult or impossible for many young Jews to  avoid. This is the problem in divine governance that R. Dov Ber sets out to examine,  defending God’s justice rather than seeking to comfort individual sufferers.45 Even  so, his theodicy is complicated by the fact that he is not just concerned with under- standing suffering as an interpretive problem, but also with fixing and restoring  intelligibility to the world by drawing down an influx of divine vitality. G r i e f ,  t e x t ,  A n D  b L e S S i n G S  o f  t H e  f L e S H A deep preoccupation of almost all Jewish mystical writing is the nature of the  continuum between spirit and matter, which is frequently treated in Habad writing  as analogous to the relationship between deed and intention. R. Dov Ber begins  his discussion of the crisis besetting Jews in Russia with a fairly abstract comment  about the relationship between human ‘avodah (divine service) and the creation or  maintenance of worldly substance: To understand the matter of the conscription of Jewish soldiers by  gentiles: Behold it is written that “the will [ratzon] of God is within his  people.” . . . The will of God, which is to say Torah and the command- ments, which is the essence of the divine will, as it is known that “it  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="10"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  407 arose in [God’s] simple will to create the world . . . in order to have an  inhabitation in the nether regions,” so that Israel would accept the Torah  and commandments upon themselves and their children, which is the  essential sustenance of the world.46 This is entirely standard Habad teaching.47 The quick initial reference to the lived  context of the discourse (i.e., conscription) is quickly eclipsed by a discussion of  divine intentionality, which is identified as the origin of both world and Torah.  Torah is, however, portrayed as ontologically prior to the world, inasmuch as it  constitutes the very purpose of creation, and is the primary conduit of divine will  into it. This is the whole premise of the argument that follows, and must be clearly  understood. Next, R. Dov Ber introduces another familiar Habad teaching, which is that  the divine will is so infinitely beyond human comprehension that it must be consid- ered “above all reason and intellect.” Though certainly decreed by divine wisdom  (a self-conscious nod to Maimonides), even the commandments of the Torah  exceed human intelligibility, which helps to explain the characteristic valorization  of the simple, unreflective deed or ma’aseh mitzvah in Habad teaching. Performing  a mitzvah—with or without understanding—is no less than an instantiation of  divine intimacy, “cleaving,” as it were, “to the body of the [divine] king.”48 Two  additional corollaries derive from this premise. One is that since the command- ments derive from the very highest point of divine emanation, deep within the  divine will or Keter (literally, “crown” or sovereignty), which precedes even the  emanation of divine wisdom (Hokhmah), religious practice even more than learning  becomes an unmatched channel for the influx of divine creative power (blessing)  upon which the world’s existence depends.49 And secondly, that this religious prac- tice should ideally be performed in a manner that is “above all reason and intel- lect,” through an act of will that eschews preoccupation with reason or consequences  beyond the simple fact of God’s command. For R. Dov Ber, this is closely analo- gous to the quality of “stubbornness” (‘akshut)—acting without rhyme or reason— which he here asserts to be a mystical virtue of the Jewish people. Indeed, no one familiar with Habad literature can read this discussion of  Jewish conscripts without being reminded of passages like the following, in which  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="11"> 408 y    Don Seeman R. Dov Ber’s father, R. Shneur Zalman, insists that even simple and unlearned  Jews are almost always stubborn to the point of death in their unwillingness to  compromise the one true faith:  Even the lowest of the low and sinners in Israel give up their lives for the  Sanctification of the Divine Name . . . and suffer severe torture rather  than deny the One G-d, even if they are coarse and ignorant, without  knowledge of the greatness of the Divine. And even that little that they  do know they do not think about at all; for they do not give up their lives  because of knowledge and contemplation of the Divine . . . [b]ut without  any knowledge, nor contemplation, just as if it were absolutely impos- sible to deny the One G-d. . . . 50 References to martyrdom abound in Tanya, where they are frequently connected  with the characteristic goal of mystical self-annihilation or bittul ha-yesh that was  a central preoccupation of all Habad ‘avodah.51 Naftali Loewenthal argues that  images of martyrdom were perhaps the primary vehicle through which R. Shneur  Zalman communicated his most abstract teachings about the nature of the soul  and the necessity of radical self-abnegation.52 Yet this ideal of self-sacrifice also  came to influence the consciousness with which all mitzvoth were meant to be  performed in Habad circles, and there is no reason to think that the possibility of  literal martyrdom or self-annihilation was any further from the ethos of early  Habad than it has been for some modern offshoots of this movement.53 The  obvious problem for R. Dov Ber, writing after his father’s death, was that R.  Shneur Zalman’s faith in the stubbornness of simple Jews did not account for his  own brother Moshe’s apparent eagerness to convert, or for the less than eager  conversions by many child conscripts. “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” may fundamentally  be read as a response to this problem.  First, R. Dov Ber creatively misreads the verse “God desires his people” (rotzeh  hashem bi-‘amo) hyperliterally as “God’s will is within His people,” meaning that  Jews become literal embodiments of the divine will when they perform the  commandments of the Torah. Yet he also quietly adds a limitation to this principle,  which is that the identification of Jews with the unmediated divine will holds true in  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="12"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  409 its fullest sense only while the Temple stands in Jerusalem, allowing the command- ments to be “fulfilled in their entirety.”54 Nowadays, when the Temple has been  destroyed, this link has also been broken and needs to be repaired. While ostensibly  concerned with the draft of Jewish soldiers, therefore, R. Dov Ber has subtly shifted  the whole context of the discourse from a vexing though proximate problem facing  the Jews in Russia to the context of metaphysical brokenness that characterizes the  whole Jewish mystical universe after the Ÿurban. This is a vital hermeneutical shift,  because now every text, event, or sociopolitical context must be interpreted not just  in the light of sacred history but also in the light of the very specific conceptual  language inherited by Hasidism from earlier forms of Jewish mysticism—shevirah  (shattering), birur (winnowing) and tikkun (rectification). One might even say that  the traditional exegetical opposition between peshat (“plain” meaning) and sod (the  secret or esoteric meaning) has here been applied to Jewish historical experience.  Not just the broadest of events, like exile and return, but even the shifting fortunes  of the Jewish people in Russia and specific government policies become a subject for  direct mystical contemplation and response. R. Dov Ber’s economy of style is impressive, given the complexity of the ideas  he attempts to convey. He moves deftly between metaphors culled from the whole  span of Jewish religious literature, including the Song of Songs, the Midrash, and  the Zohar. He writes that the destruction of the Temple should not be thought of  as punishment for Jewish sinfulness because punishment implies rehabilitation,  yet the destruction of the Temple means that Jews can no longer fulfill the divine  will in its entirety even when they wish to. Rather, he writes, “This is like a person  whose friend thwarts his will, so that his love turns into hate and he no longer  desires to help his friend.”55 Yet this bleak assessment is immediately moderated by  a startling new metaphor of the divine relationship with Israel: “My beloved is like a gazelle [Songs 2:9].” Just as a gazelle, when it flees,  turns its head to look behind it, so does the Holy One Blessed be He  when he flees [Zohar II:14a]—which is to say that his will is being  withdrawn. As for what is written that he turns his head behind him,  behold his “head” is as in the verse [Songs 5:11] “his head is like fine  gold [זפ],” which refers to the eighty-seven [ז”פ] commandments that  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="13"> 410 y    Don Seeman remain [after the Temple’s destruction]. . . . These eighty-seven  remaining commandments are the essential subsistence of the world, as  by way of metaphor the head contains the soul’s essential vitality, from  which it spreads to all of the other limbs by way of the sinews (which are  called “nerves”), as is well-known.56 This dense juxtaposition of shifting analogies—from God as inscrutable sover- eign to alienated friend to a gazelle fleeing for its life and then finally to a golden- headed lover—is performed with a deftness that does not allow the merely casual  reader to notice that he or she is being pulled into a new perceptive framework, in  which God and human may be both victims and intimates simultaneously. This is  an old midrashic technique, sharpened possibly to its most acute by Hasidic  authors, who confronted the terrors of Jewish persecution and abandonment in  modern times.57 If Walter Benjamin’s famous backward-glancing angel has come  to signify a paradigmatic nostalgia among secularists for the human loss entailed  by what we call “progress,” so, too, is R. Dov Ber’s backward-glancing gazelle  paradigmatic of the loss suffered by the pious who still mourn the Ÿurban. By  telling readers that God still desires, as it were, to be “caught” by those who hunt  Him, R. Dov Ber invites them to participate in sorrow, longing, and “stubborn”  unreasoning dedication to the commandments that remain.58  Yet this invitation is frequently spurned, since even those Jews who continue to  perform the remaining commandments do so primarily by rote (mitzvoth ’anashim  melumadah), without the fear and love or “desire of the heart” that would allow them  to “fly upward.” This is the context in which God gives the world one final chance to  persist by sending evil decrees into the hearts of kings like Tsar Nicholas: They put a razor to [a Jew’s] beard and side-locks and force him to  violate the Sabbath, and so forth. Then, by means of that bodily pain,  his heart cries out with a bitter voice to God: “My God, My God! Why  hast Thou forsaken me? You are far from my salvation, my cry!” Also,  “Why was I created except to do His blessed will; I was not born for  confusion and emptiness,” etc. Then his soul really weeps in secret, and  he performs any mitzvah that comes to hand with joy.59 PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="14"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  411 By forcing a visceral and humiliating confrontation with Jewish alienation from  the divine (forced shaving and Sabbath violation), R. Dov Ber argues, this kind of  pain also releases hidden potentialities of grief and religious fervor in the hearts of  penitents. “Now, even the pain he feels at not performing the mitzvoth is accounted  to him as if he had performed them.”60  This is no mere hyperbole, because pain, which we in the contemporary West  tend to think of as a purely subjective and individualistic experience, is here an  ontological reality that seems sometimes to function as a channel for the divine  influx and sometimes to constitute the divine influx itself. The creation of the  universe out of undifferentiated divinity is premised for kabbalists upon a series of  contractions, known collectively as zimzum, that generates the possibility for fini- tude. Commentators in the Habad tradition frequently emphasize that zimzum is  a matter of perspective and occlusion rather than true contraction of divinity— divinity remains unchanged—but the pain that this hiding of divinity necessarily  entails is still very real, and is mysteriously bound up with possibilities for human  flourishing. “[S]ince in each and every world there was a contraction of His infi- nite light to the level that it could be received,” writes a first-generation Hasidic  writer, “[therefore] judgments and afflictions that a person suffers constitute a  body to the . . . spiritual vitality that shines upon a person . . . the light of the En  Sof that enlivens all, and when a person welcomes affliction with joy and love he  performs a unification, joining the vessel and body . . . to the soul.”61 This means  that bearing pain for the sake of God promises to transform the human into a  receptive vessel for new creative energy, which also means that Hasidism has  turned the Lurianic myth into a self-conscious platform for emotional self- management and transformation.62   There is also a strong literary-interpretive dimension to zimzum, inasmuch as  too much or too little contraction can render divine revelation unintelligible. For  R. Dov Ber and some other post-Lurianic Kabbalists, zimzum “is the appearance  of veils . . . that prevent the Infinite from appearing in the world,” which also  means that “the letters [of Torah] are disorganized” and incoherent.63 Esoteric  readers who find the right hermeneutic to render the text comprehensible are  therefore engaged in an act of managing zimzum, which Shaul Magid appropri- ately calls “a replication of God’s originary act.”64 This is the metaphysical back- Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="15"> 412 y    Don Seeman ground to Harold Bloom’s literary observation that textual meaning, in Kabbalah,  “is the hurt”—i.e., contraction—“that meaning itself is hurtful.”65 The limitation  of Bloom’s reading, however, is precisely that Kabbalah cannot be reduced to a  theory of meaning for its adherents.  In the passage we have been considering, for example, R. Dov Ber invokes the  theme of “secret weeping,” based on Jeremiah 13:17, which has been amplified in  later rabbinic and mystical literature to connote the hidden redemptive power  signified by divine and human emotion. When he cites this idea in the passage  analyzed above (“Then his soul really weeps in secret, and he performs any mitzvah  that comes to hand with joy”), R. Dov Ber is also referencing the well-known  ritual weeping of mystics that is said to draw vitality down into the world by  evoking divine compassion.66 It must be emphasized that in Hasidism, such  weeping is also described as a type of zimzum (emotional contraction) that is asso- ciated almost everywhere with literary practices like the composition and reading  of sacred texts.67 R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi himself wrote that weeping in secret  is what makes the all too often merely abstract Torah that one studies into “bread,”  or visceral sanctity, which enlivens the body as well as the mind. Without such  weeping, a person’s textual learning remains ritually inefficacious, but Torah with  secret weeping (i.e., deep engagement of the whole person) is called talmudo  be-yado—literally, “his learning is in his hand,”68—which reinforces the idea that  sorrow and weeping are related to the corporeal sustenance of creation. This is the  Hasidic interpretation of the rabbinic dictum that “one who mourns the destruc- tion of the Temple is accounted like one who offered himself in sacrifice upon it,”  and this is also why R. Dov Ber encourages the study of the lost sacrificial order by  Hasidim—not for the information it conveys, but for the grief it can arouse.69  The concentration of divine power or essence within a sacred text—up to and  including the identification of God with Torah—is a familiar trope in the history  of Jewish mysticism.70 But “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” emphasizes a corollary of this  idea, which is that the text can also serve as a site for the concentration of human  vitality and emotion that help to drive the cosmic process forward. This is what  makes the reading and writing of such a text—when it is accompanied by secret  weeping and practice of the commandments—into such an efficacious and world- sustaining act. “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” is not just a text but an event; not just an  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="16"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  413 occasion for secret weeping on the part of its author and his immediate circle, but  a veritable instantiation of that practice for future readers. In the final analysis, its  import is not primarily for the information it conveys but for the ritual-experien- tial template it provides for acting upon a broken cosmos.  o n  L i t e r A r y  m y S t i c i S m  A n D  t H e  L i m i t S  o f  e m P A t H y Unresolved grief has frequently been associated with mystical and literary  creativity.71 “Mysticism,” writes David Aberbach, “can satisfy the need for an  orderly, transcendent, goal-oriented form of grief.”72 An attempt has even been  made to explain whole mystical movements such as Hasidism in this way, since the  early bereavement of people like the Baal Shem Tov allegedly inclines them to  mystical union with the object of loss or its substitute.73 This view is closely related  to Bloom’s theory of Kabbalah as a kind of substitution, and draws upon Gershom  Scholem’s argument that the flowering of kabbalistic literature in the fifteenth to  sixteenth centuries came in direct response to historical grief occasioned by the  exile of Jews from Spain.74 I myself have emphasized the relationship between  “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” and its author’s private grief. Yet this essentially “thera- peutic” view of mystical literature may also neglect the ways in which some texts  work hard to arouse and sustain the experience of grief because of definite cosmo- logical and ritual understandings of what texts do, what literature is for, and what  the divine vitality embodied within human emotion can accomplish. Instead of  rushing to a universal psychoanalytic frame, we need to map more clearly the  shape of the emotional world that a writer like R. Dov Ber inhabits.  “On the Conscription of Jewish Soldiers” conveys deep sorrow and sympathy  for the plight of God, the cosmos, and the Jewish people. This does not, however,  translate into sympathy for the individual apostate, whose existence poses a profound  challenge to Jews not just on the pragmatic or political level but also fundamentally  to the Hasidic worldview elaborated by R. Dov Ber’s father. Even simple Jews, after  all, are said by R. Schneur Zalman to give their lives willingly in martyrdom, rather  than deny the unity and oneness of the God of Israel. Popular representations of  converts to Christianity among Ashkenazi Jews going back at least to the sixteenth  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="17"> 414 y    Don Seeman century, as Elisheva Carlebach has shown, emphasized that they were dangerous  and malevolent traitors to their people, a view that continues in many circles to this  day.75 This was complicated to some degree in Russia under Tsar Nicholas, when  many converts—not all of them conscripts—were children as young as eleven. Some  of these nonconscripted child converts later attributed their conversion to lack of  attention from their parents, to the fact of being orphans, or to the influence of non- Jewish friends. Their parents tended, by contrast, to blame the apostasy of boys on  rebelliousness and that of girls on madness or weakness of mind.76  Nor was this a purely private, family matter. Even as the government worked  to obtain the “Russification” of Jewish children, some parents paradoxically sought  government intervention against forced conversion or kidnapping. Cases of  counter-abduction have been documented, as well as at least one reported case of  what ChaeRan Freeze has called “honor-killing” by parents desperate to prevent  child conversions.77 Given this broad context, child conscription should be viewed  as merely the most brutal enactment of a lopsided and terrifying contest between  Jewish communities and the Christian regime that sought to assimilate them. Lev  Itzkowitz, who devoted a chapter in his memoir to the experience of being a child  conscript, described one military officer (himself a Jewish convert) who told the  boys in his charge that as long as he lived, none of them would leave the canton  both living and Jewish.78 Opposition to conversion was considered a life-and-death  issue by Jewish communities, and this could not help but color attitudes toward  individual converts. Converted children who survived their military service and  tried to return many years later to their families were sometimes rejected for having  gone over to the enemy.79 This attitude was shared by some important secular literary figures. Writing to  Alter Druianov on October 24, 1908, the Hebrew writer Asher Ginsburg (Ahad  Ha-Am) had the following to say about the conversion of Simon Dubnow’s  daughter: But how can he, a man like Dubnow, make peace with the thought that  his daughter fattens calves for idol worship and that his descendants will  be Gentiles and anti-semites? In this situation, there is only one way to  escape the sorrow that consumes body and soul, and that is to tear out  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="18"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  415 from the heart in one act all the ties which bind him to the sinful soul,  and to consider her dead and non-existent. This is what our forefathers  did, not out of cruelty, but because they could not otherwise bear the  terrible pain, which for them was worse than death.80 David Assaf suggests that relatively few families of converts left written records of  the events surrounding conversion precisely because of the deadly shame they  experienced.81 One dimension of R. Dov Ber’s essay on the conscription of Jewish  soldiers, in this context, must surely have been a metaphysical defense of his family  and of the broader Jewish community against the humiliation of Moshe’s apos- tasy. He needed to explain, in other words, how and why such a thing could  happen, even though the explanation he offered might only deepen the rationale  for rejection of individual converts like his brother root and branch.  “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” concludes with a discussion of the Lurianic concept of  birur, or winnowing of good from evil, to which we have already alluded.82 Like  many earlier kabbalists, R. Dov Ber mapped this separation of good from evil onto  a hard sociological-cum-metaphysical distinction between Jews and gentiles.83 In  Lurianic Kabbalah, Esau and Ishmael (the eponymous forebears of Christendom  and Islam) were the “chaff” that had to be separated from the true progeny of  Abraham and Isaac—the people of Israel.84 R. Dov Ber’s application of this motif  to the fate of Jewish apostates in his own day is the defining moment of his essay  as a whole: “The coming of the Messiah,” he writes, is dependent upon the separa- tion of good from evil,” which is accomplished in part by the final separation from  the Jewish people of those individuals whose apostasy reveals a radical and preex- isting metaphysical estrangement from the Jewish people. Is this winnowing the  mystical equivalent to Ahad Ha-Am’s insistence that Dubnow’s converted daughter  should be treated as already dead—the profound and widespread cultural rejection  by Jews of converted sons and daughters? If so, it lacks the redeeming immediacy  of parental anguish that might, even at this distance, lend such radical stratagems  an aura of human necessity.  At the same time, it is well to remember that personal grief is not trivially  expressed in Habad Hasidism—the deeper the source, the holier the experience, the  more levushim, or “garments” and mediation, are said to be required to contain it. I  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="19"> 416 y    Don Seeman am also mindful of the fact that literary depictions of birur like this one ought to be  understood as something more than simple representations of the way the world is  according to Hasidism. They are, rather, ritual mechanisms for managing the  ambivalence, fear, rage and anxiety that phenomena like apostasy under coercion  clearly evoked among nineteenth-century Russian Jews. R. Dov Ber’s recitation of  the discourse “On Conscription of Jewish Soldiers” and its repetition by his followers  over time constitutes a kind of purification ritual that reaffirms broken boundaries  and reintegrates the world whose dissolution has been threatened by this continuing  assault upon Jewish children. “Religious theories that emphasize meaning focus on  the end-product, a story that is said to link heaven and earth,” writes Robert Orsi,  “but the stability and solidity of this dissolves if you focus instead on the processes of  religious meaning-making. What we see if we do this is the wounding; in this devo- tional world, as in others, meaning-making is wounding.”85 The emotionally disengaged tone of the second half of the essay, in which  converts are metaphysically disavowed, points perhaps paradoxically to an abun- dance of grief that can scarcely be contained. It also gives voice to a deep onto- logical dualism distinguishing Jews from non-Jews in many Hasidic settings, but  perhaps nowhere more forcefully than in early Habad, about which Roman Foxb- runner has written that non-Jews are “of a completely different and inferior order”  from Jews.86 Yet it must also be emphasized that the decision to place Jews who  converted under duress on the gentile side of this cosmological ledger was itself a  contingent, interpretive act. There is no absolute consensus in Jewish religious  writing about the status of a Jew who converts, but the medieval ruling that “an  Israelite, though he sins, remains an Israelite” has often been brought to bear.87  Magid’s provocative argument that the return to Judaism by many Iberian  conversos in the sixteenth century was one of the driving forces behind the flow- ering of kabbalistic writing in Safed merits consideration here.88 Magid argues  that R. Hayyim Vital used the biblical erev rav or “mixed multitude” who left  Egypt with the Israelites as a literary cipher for returning conversos of his own day;  that he tried to create an interpretive space in which the erev rav, who stood for  Jews returning to Judaism from Christianity, could be redeemed rather than  “winnowed.” If Magid is right, this only underscores the contingency of R. Dov  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="20"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  417 Ber’s decision to imbue the social and religious antagonism of his own day with an  aura of cosmic inevitability.  Jews in nineteenth-century Russia could scarcely hope for the return of lost  brethren to Judaism in any large numbers. Compounding state-sponsored conver- sionary programs like the brutal cantonist regime in R. Dov Ber’s day were  increasing pressures from Western European missionary societies like the London  Society for the Promotion of Christianity Amongst the Jews, whose emissaries  made significant inroads in Russia between 1817 and 1825, and were even granted  an audience with the tsar.89 While Russian and Catholic churches pursued a classic  conversionary strategy demanding that Jews break entirely with their Jewish ethnic  and communal ties, groups like the London Society promoted an ideal of “Hebrew  Christian” faith, in which “Jewish Christians” would remain Jews in all but reli- gion, and work to proselytize their co-religionists from within. Both religious and  secular Jewish groups in Russia overwhelmingly rejected this splitting of ethnic  and religious Jewishness, but one effect of R. Dov Ber’s approach that should be  appreciated in this regard was his insistence that apostasy represented a break even  with the metaphysical Jewishness or pintele yud (“point of Jewishness”) that Habad  writers invoked so readily with respect to other kinds of sinners. This would have  been a powerful rebuke to the Hebrew Christian ideology. “As long as he has not  converted,” R. Dov Ber writes toward the end of this essay, “a Jew can purify the  air around him.”90 And then he adds defiantly that even though a thousand people  might convert, “a single God-fearing Jew can sustain the world by observing the  mitzvoth that remain.”91  The divine ecology of birur that R. Dov Ber invokes may have helped to stem  the loss of cultural and religious confidence among Jews faced by the conversionary  tide, but it also paradoxically naturalized apostasy on a metaphysical level. “In  truth one thing depends upon another,” he writes. “For in order for one person to  become God-fearing . . . there must perforce be a corresponding winnowing of  pure chaff, which are the heretics and apostates.”92 This radical, zero-sum model  of Jewishness not only helps to explain why some Jews convert to Christianity but  also offers a culturally and theologically coherent rationale for why converts must  be rejected and treated as dead, no matter how painful—or better, why they are in  some sense dead already. Elsewhere, R. Dov Ber describes the pesolet (chaff, or  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="21"> 418 y    Don Seeman waste) in human life as that which must be “pushed out,” like perspiration, which  is a waste product of blood, or evil thoughts that must be purged through dreams.93  The use of physiological metaphors for metaphysical process is characteristic  Habad methodology, best expressed in the mystical epigraph, “from my flesh I  will see God.”94 Because winnowing takes place on both planes simultaneously, it  makes the social death of converts into something as natural and inevitable as the  process of alimentation, or the body’s elimination of physical waste.  We can only speculate whether the author of “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” self- consciously considered what it meant to treat his younger brother Moshe as the chaff  winnowed from their common father. Despite their characteristic foregrounding of  emotionality in religious life, Hasidic texts are notoriously reticent in portraying the  lived experience of their authors.95 “One handbreadth is revealed, two are hidden.”  Even the “secret weeping” invoked by R. Dov Ber emulates the divine zimzum more  effectively when it is hidden deep within psychic interiority, which is one of the  reasons that no precise equivalent of Christian mystical autobiography ever devel- oped in Jewish literature. The essay on conscription of Jewish soldiers concludes  with a sense that much of what has been negotiated here has barely been exposed by  its author to view. The logic of birur is harsh and unsettling, but it can also be read as  a strategy for the defense or management of porous social and religious boundaries.  Perhaps we should say simply that birur is what remains when even secret weeping  for a fallen brother has failed to prevent the unthinkable. c o n c L u S i o n :  o n  t H e  m y S t i c A L  P o e t i c S  o f  H A S i D i S m If poetics are conceived as the study of how meaning is formulated and conveyed in  different literary settings, a few preliminary observations about the mystical poetics  of Hasidism may now be offered. First, it is well to remember that Hasidic texts are  not all of one genre—the convoluted tales of Rebbe Nachman and the biblical glosses  of Mei ha-Shiloaÿ or Kedushat Levi are in many ways incommensurate with the self- standing discursive treatises identified with writers in the Habad tradition. “Lekiÿat  ’anshe ÿayil” contains little or no narrative, and is written in a terse, technical style— indeed, much of the printed edition is conveyed in acronyms and shorthand expres- PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="22"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  419 sions for highly specialized mystical vocabularies. Readers need to familiarize  themselves with the special rhetorical styles of individual authors, since even a basic  term like bittul (self-abnegation) means something different in Habad than it does  in Kotzk.96 The mystical tract or kuntres favored by R. Dov Ber is a literary form  adapted to communication among scholars and their students; it lacks the whimsy or  obvious literary interest sometimes associated with Hasidic literature for the masses.  On the other hand, focusing attention on how these texts convey meaning through  distinctive poetic forms is all the more vital because of the difficulty of their inter- pretation, and the light such a project may shed on the literary context of Hasidism.  Much of the recent resurgence of interest in mystical texts as literature has  focused not surprisingly on works with strong narrative content like the Zohar, or  texts with explicit interpretive and exegetical agendas.97 This is much to be encour- aged, but there is also a danger of reducing the analysis of mystical literature to  only those features of texts that conform to a Western academic understanding of  what literature—conceived mostly as an aesthetic form—really is. The aesthetic of  a text like “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” is measured in elegance of argumentation and  economy of language, and in the text’s ability to apply a compelling mystical  hermeneutic to frightening or disheartening realities like the oppressive and deadly  conscription of Jewish children. The essay weaves disparate social, political, and  religious realities together into a picture that commands assent, if it is successful,  and changes the nature of what is experienced going forward. But this perceptual  change also brings emotional and subjective factors into play, like the valorization  of “brokenness” and the sorrow that accompanies ritual practice in a broken, post- ÿurban world. Furthermore, it cannot be emphasized strongly enough that in this  context, the literary production of affect is meant not just to change the way people  feel about the world, but also to effect change directly upon the world and cosmos.  While Jewish mystical texts can be appreciated as literature and reclaimed to some  extent by those who do not share their religious and cosmological presuppositions  (see Shaul Magid, this volume), understanding how these texts work as texts also  requires dedicated attention to the whole context of religious experience,  cosmology, and practice in which they are naturally embedded.  The great and generative insight of Harold Bloom’s work Kabbalah and Criti- cism is that classical kabbalistic writing may be understood in part as a response to  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="23"> 420 y    Don Seeman the anxiety of influence faced by suffering and creative religious thinkers within a  vibrant, yet constraining tradition. Bloom was right to emphasize the linguistic and  interpretive dimension of kabbalistic consciousness, and to recognize that many of  the basic concepts of kabbalistic literature are relational categories that amount to a  theory of influence comparable to literary theories of influence upon writers. Yet he  was wrong to allow his fascination with literary and aesthetic categories to cloud his  view of mystical experience conveyed or conditioned by such texts. He derides ritual  efficacy as “magic” that bespeaks the “degeneracy” of lived religion:  Mysticism is a word I have avoided in this essay, for Kabbalah seems to  me more of an interpretive and mythical tradition than a mystical  one. . . . By centering upon the Bible, Kabbalah made of itself, at its  best, a critical tradition, though distinguished by more invention than  critical traditions generally display. In its degeneracy, Kabbalah has  sought vainly for a power over nature, but in its glory it sought, and  found, a power of the mind over the universe of death.98 “Glory” and “degeneracy” are of course to be found primarily in the eye of the  beholder. More tendentious than Bloom’s personal preference for a literature that  privileges “power of the mind” over the power to control nature is the idea that these  can be cleanly distinguished, or that the literary features of mystical writing can be  surgically detached from the ways in which these texts are read and used by real  communities of readers. A text like “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” is the norm rather than  the exception in Hasidic literature because it seeks to “enlighten” the world literally  as well as figuratively, and to bring real salvation. The resistance that this feature of  Hasidic writing engenders in some contemporary readers ought to focus our atten- tion more resolutely upon our own strategies of representation and consumption.  The movement of these texts from nineteenth-century shtibl to twenty-first-century  college classroom or suburban Habad House ought not to go unanalyzed.  Permeability of the boundaries between world and text (i.e., “magic”) is not  just an elite mystical teaching, but one adapted to strategies of physical and spiri- tual healing by Habad communities to this day.99 It has also been applied by Habad  or its offshoots (especially in Israel) to claims of a political nature about how  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="24"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  421 kabbalistic categories can be used to understand and manage problems of war and  peace, conceived as episodes of spiritual healing writ large. Understanding the  effectiveness of words in Hasidic life requires a poetics that is attuned to the ritual  dimensions of textuality, and to the different kinds of efficacy to which literary  practices may aspire. One of the unique features of Hasidism has been the special  emphasis it places upon the evocation, training, and management of human  emotion as a key to intimacy with—and influence upon—the divine. But we need  a better account of the embodied gestures (kissing, weeping, or writing and  reading) that accompany the transmission and use of such texts in lived settings.100  What I have in mind is something more like Geertz’s “thick description” than like  the relatively thin sitz-im-leben studies of biblical cultures lost to antiquity. Indeed,  the proximity of Hasidism in time and space to modern cultural projects opens up  possibilities that have not yet been sufficiently explored for the integration of  textual, ethnographic, and sociopolitical analysis that together contribute to  Hasidism’s extraordinary penchant for “doing things with words.”101  While judicious external comparisons are necessary to this kind of analysis, an  effective poetic lexicon for Hasidism must be built up primarily from sources more  proximate to the text. The term cultural poetics has been coined to suggest the dense  interrelations between text and context that need to be considered in any act of  reading.102 But I am arguing that all poetics are cultural poetics, in the sense that  strategies of meaning-making are always dependent upon the specialized lexicons of  local cultural and literary traditions that can be obscured through overreliance on  universalizing psychoanalytic or literary critical models.103 One of the conclusions to  be drawn from this study of “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” is the extent to which the highly  technical discourse of Habad mysticism is actually dependent upon much broader  cultural and religious trends among East European Jews. The quest for intercession  at gravesites, rituals of grief and mourning over the tsar’s decree, and the rhetorical  frames by which converts (including children) were bitterly rejected and excluded  from the imagined fellowship of Jews were all broadly cultural phenomena that R.  Dov Ber adapted and sharpened in his mystical writing. That is why even ostensibly  anti-rabbinic, maskilic texts like those surrounding Moshe’s conversion or the  conversion by Simon Dubnow’s daughter can help to shed light on the tensions and  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="25"> 422 y    Don Seeman assumptions underlying Hasidic literature (and why readings in Hasidic literature  can also support better understanding of maskilic texts).  In responding to the anxieties of their time, Hasidic writers make choices that  are constrained, but not dictated in any simple or mechanical way by the classical  sources upon which they draw. Writing from the Warsaw Ghetto before his  murder in 1944, Rabbi Kalonymos Shapira cites many of the same prooftexts  about pain and secret weeping (including the humiliation of forced shaving and  the redemptive power of sorrow) that were previously cited by R. Dov Ber in his  essay on “Conscription of Jewish Soldiers.”104 But R. Shapira consistently invokes  an ethos of sympathy and identification with those who stumble or collapse in the  face of unfathomable trauma, and never, in the context of the Holocaust, invokes  the model of birur to explain why some Jews have lost their faith. Unlike R. Dov  Ber, moreover, he dwells on the possibility that even the most faithful Jews may be  lost, “so that he does not know any more if he is a Jew or a human being or an  animal. . . . There is no one left to feel.”105  Comparisons are necessarily imprecise, but one has the sense that something  profound has changed in the century that separates Rabbi Dov Ber from Rabbi  Shapira. Indeed, even later Habad writers seem to have drawn back in tone, if not  substance, from their predecessor’s harsh imagery. The seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe,  R. Menahem Mendl Schneerson of New York, cites R. Dov Ber’s essay in a 1954  Purim discourse, where he invokes the theme of birur in a more positive vein, to  show that “even a child raised among idolaters” will eventually learn about some  mitzvah that they can perform with great vitality (hiyyut), bringing life to the  world.106 In 1956, R. Schneerson mentions this essay by way of emphasizing the  precious quality of mitzvoth that were actually performed by Jewish conscripts in  the tsar’s army.107 He offers no direct contradiction with anything R. Dov Ber wrote  about Jewish converts to Christianity, but his tone and emphasis bespeak a very  different sensibility toward sinners. Modern Habad has devoted itself to a principle  of aggressive outreach and inclusion of almost all Jews on a broad ethnic and meta- physical basis that may require a more open and measured rhetorical stance.108 A  study of how the boundaries of empathy are fixed and managed in different literary  and real-world settings (with respect to Jews as well as non-Jews) is one of the most  important desiderata for a cultural poetics of modern Jewish mystical literature.  PROOFTEXTS 29: 3 </page> <page sequence="26"> Apostasy, Grief, and Literary Practice in Habad Hasidism    y  423 We should recall that the term empathy was first coined in a literary context to  describe the ways texts help to convey human experience to readers.109 Literary  traditions that help to focus and delimit empathic concern exemplify the media- tion of moral, metaphysical, and aesthetic dimensions of textual practice. This is  where ritual efficacy and literary production meet. But if ritual models work hard  to portray a world that is on some level integrated and harmonious, they also stand  as ironic witness to the fact that they are frequently invoked upon a world that is  actually experienced as broken, recalcitrant of meaning, and in need of repair.110  The importance of efficacy to literary production in Habad Hasidism is attested  not just by extraordinary texts like “On the Conscription of Jewish Soldiers,”  which was written explicitly as a response to catastrophe, but also more broadly by  the tradition that links mystical writing in general with painful or troubling  historical events. The imprisonment and liberation of R. Shneur Zalman by  Russian authorities in 1798 is, for instance, understood within Habad as giving  him permission to reveal secrets that would not otherwise have been given to  written revelation, and the ongoing association of different mystical tracts with  specific dates in the Jewish liturgical calendar builds on this association—making  ritual space for the ongoing rectification of history.111  Yet the secret that animates mystical literature is that despite its power to combat  dissonance, to engender an affective response, or to draw divine blessing down from  above, literature never triumphs decisively. Whatever tikkun R. Dov Ber may have  been able to effect through his writing and preaching, the fate of cantonists and  their families remained bitter. The challenge to traditional ways of understanding  Jewishness that they posed through their death and apostasy—or even through their  return home as survivors—grew more rather than less pronounced over time.  Conversion remained inassimilable to traditional Jewish culture, maybe even disrup- tive to its capacity for representation. To the extent that “Lekiÿat ’anshe ÿayil” makes  cultural and religious sense of the phenomenon, it does so by rendering the experi- ence of converts themselves utterly opaque. The Warsaw Ghetto diarist Emmanuel  Ringelblum once observed that Jewish converts to Christianity suffered a great deal  under the Nazis precisely because they were persecuted and killed without even those  cultural and religious defenses available to many Jews. Why, after all, should they  have been subject to this fate at all?112 Perhaps, like R. Dov Ber, they believed that  Fall 2009 </page> <page sequence="27"> 424 y    Don Seeman conversion had placed them irrevocably outside the national, religious and even meta- physical body of the chosen people. If so, this was one of those occasions on which  literary categories and expectations proved simply inadequate to the contingencies of  life beyond the text.

This discourse was delivered on Shabbat Hazon, 5477 (1817). 94 This is a common citation of Job 19:26, which kabbalists use to argue for the possibility  of learning about the divine through analogy with human experience and bodies. R.  Menachem Recanati, for example, argued in his thirteenth-century Torah  commentary (76c) that even though God is wholly incorporeal, anthropomorphic  biblical language points to a metaphysical reality in which something analogous to a  hand or an eye can in fact be attributed to God. Hasidic sources tend to differ from  these medieval and early modern kabbalists by focusing on analogies between  divine and human emotions and lived experience rather than on bodies (i.e.,  anthropopathism rather than anthropomorphism). See, for instance, the teaching  attributed to the Baal Shem Tov in Keter Shem Tov I:91, II:508, and the explicit  teaching to this effect by R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi in Torah ’or, Toldot 19a. For  just two of many examples of this principle to which one may point in R. Dov Ber  Schneersohn’s extensive corpus, see Torat Ÿayyim I 23d (Shemot) and 199a  (Beshallaÿ). Anthropologists have shown that the principle of analogy is also  important for ritual healing strategies among contemporary Habad Hasidim in  London.

For discussion, see Seeman, “Martyrdom,  Emotion and the Work of Ritual.” 97 For two recent examples out of many, see Haskell, “Metaphor, Transformation and  Transcendence,” and Wolsky, “Mystical Poetics,” as well as Fishbane in this volume.
