<plain_text><page sequence="1">Work and Play: Some Aspects of Folk Drama in Russia Elizabeth A. Warner The date 1672 is generally regarded as an important one in the history of the Russian theatre, for it was on the seventeenth of October of that year that the first performance of the play Es fir or Artakserksovo deistvo was given in the specially built theatre at the village of Preobraghenskoe near Moscow before the Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich and his court. Esfir has often been referred to as "the first play of the Russian theatre." It was commissioned to celebrate the birth of Aleksei Mik- hailovich's son, the future Peter the Great, and it appears to have been a tremendous success. It is said the Tsar watched engrossed for ten solid hours. Certainly we know from contem- porary bills that no expense had been spared, either on the con- struction of the theatre or the preparation of the costumes. Many expensive materials were used for the latter - brightly coloured Persian silks, Turkish satin and fine cloth from Ger- many - and they were lavishly decorated with silver and gold braid, lace and embroideries. Real ermine was used for Arta- xerxes' robes. It was probably the lavish spectacle and the sheer novelty of the occasion which impressed the court rather than the skill of the actors, for the cast was composed of untrained clerks, artisans, and shop-keepers from the German quarter of Moscow. They knew little Russian and were gathered together for rehearsal approximately one month before the performance by the German pastor Gregory whom Alexsei Mikhailovich had approached with his proposal for the play. The Tsar's enjoyment of the first play he had ever seen had a certain importance for the development of theatre in Russia. Its popularity at court was ensured for many years to come, 151</page><page sequence="2">152 Comparative Drama although performances took place only sporadically during the four years between its inauguration and the death of its founder in 1676. The tradition was, however, carried on by Peter's sister Natalya and Praskov'ya Fedorovna (widow of John V, Peter's half-brother) and her daughter at the royal palace at Izmailova. Later, of course, Peter the Great himself recognised the im- portance of the theatre both as a weapon of political propaganda and as an instrument of education and helped to introduce it to a wider audience with the building of the public theatre on Red Square in 1702. That Aleksei Mikhailovich should thus have been instru- mental in acquainting the Russian aristocracy with the pleasures of the theatrical art is ironic, for the same man failed to recog- nize and accept the desire to play and be entertained among his ordinary subjects. In the early years of his reign the Tsar had endorsed and indeed encouraged ecclesiastical condemnation and persecution of most forms of popular entertainment - dancing, singing, the playing of musical instruments, fisticuffs, masking at Christmastide, and taking part in the many ritual games so popular in the Russian countryside. Long before Aleksei Mikhailovich "founded" the Russian theatre, the ordin- ary Russian people had developed their own liking and talent for play acting in a variety of different ways. Old Russian secular and ecclesiastical documents are full of references dating from the twelfth century onwards to the antics of the skomorokhi, Russia's wandering players, to mumming at Christmastide, to spring ritual games and amusements at wed- dings and funerals. An epistle from bishop Pamfil in 1505, for example, describes the celebrations on St. John's Eve in which almost the whole town of Pskov took part. Women and girls danced with much hand-clapping and stamping of feet to the accompaniment of tambourines, reed pipes, and various stringed instruments. 1 In Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich's order of 1648 for- bidding folk entertainments, the custom of putting on masks and costumes such as the skomorokhi wore, of dressing up and lead- ing about the "devilish mare" (i.e., the hobby-horse) were among the condemned activities.2 The need to dramatise and "play" is clearly a deep-seated human instinct, common to all peoples including the most prim- itive. One of the most important impulses towards the creation of drama is almost certainly a combination of man's ability to</page><page sequence="3">Elizabeth A . Warner 153 observe accurately the world around him and his desire to re- produce in play what he sees and hears. Man is in fact a highly imitative animal. In this respect it is interesting to note the high incidence of imitation in children's games. Modern British child- ren will play at "Hospitals," "Schools," or "Mothers and Fa- thers" - games in which they imitate to the best of their ability the behavior of the grown-ups involved. Russian peasant child- ren in the past, living in small, isolated rural communities, must have relied heavily in their imitative play upon the observance of simple domestic scenes and familiar daily events. Indeed a large number of such games were recorded in the last century by ethnographers such as P. V. Shein, A. Tereshchenko, E. A. Pokrovskii, and V. F. Kudryavtsev. Many of these are quite predictable in content and differ only in detail from games we have enjoyed ourselves. There was, for example, Gosti≈•sya ("Paying visits") in which little girls would "bake pies" out of clay and build huts in which they pretended to entertain their friends. In another game Gorshki ("Pots," a reference to the earthenware pots used for the cooking and serving of food, milk, etc.) boys and girls played at "families," building a house which they decorated with bunches of flowers, making food from sand and water, eating at table, going off to work, pasturing the horses, cutting corn, and so on.3 Of greater interest are games which describe more specific activities such as Polotno ("Cloth") in which the simple act of buying and selling ma- terial was reproduced with symbolic gestures. The children held hands and stood in a long line. This was the "cloth." One child played the part of the merchant and another that of the cus- tomer. Several yards of cloth were measured off, the merchant using his outstretched arms as a tape measure, and a number of children were correspondingly removed from the line. The remainder twisted themselves up in a huddle showing that the material had been rolled up again. This process was repeated several times until one customer, realizing he had been cheated, returned to complain. The game ended in confusion with the dishonest merchant himself being rolled up in the "bale of cloth."4 Even the seamier side of life in pre-Revolutionary Russia found an echo in children's play. Take Kandaly ("Fet- ters"). 5 In this game the children stood in two facing rows. One child shouts: "Fetters." "They're on," comes the reply. "Unlock them." "Whose shall I unlock?" "Your friend's." "Which</page><page sequence="4">154 Comparative Drama friend?" "Serega." At this the child whose name has been called makes a dash for freedom to the opposite row followed by the kicks and cuffs of his former mates. Although essentially no more than a chasing game, Kandaly seems to recall the days of the chain-gangs, a not too unfamiliar sight in pre-Revolutionary days. New recruits, dragged unwillingly from their families for long years of service in the Russian army, were frequently chained together to prevent them escaping; prisoners were chained together for heavy work such as the building of roads, and on the main route to Siberia, the "Vladimirka," the sad columns of chained exiles, were a familiar sight. Similarly, hunts for deserters, runaway peasants, or escaped prisoners are clearly remembered in the game Beglye ("The Runaways"), recorded by Efimenko in the Archangel government. The players divide into two groups, the runaways and the police searchers. When they are caught the runaways are dragged back, lassoed together. A series of stylized "punishments" are inflicted upon them. Bundles of birch rods were prepared before the game began, but there is no indication that they were actually used.6 The reproduction in play of adult behavior appears to be instinctive among children of all races even in the most primi- tive societies and extends beyond the merely domestic to the ritual acts and observances which most closely affected both the individuals and the larger social group of which the children formed a part. Ralph Beals and Harry Hoijer write of children in An Introduction to Anthropology: But children are not continually preached at nor harassed by fears, actually they spend much of their time in games. Both sexes make and play with dolls and miniature household equip- ment. Boys play at hunting and war, and may even imitate in play the dancers and singers they see and hear in ceremonials.? Russian village children also used the material of ritual as a basis for play. One of the most colorful and spectacular events of rural life until the beginning of this century was the peasant marriage ritual; therefore it is perhaps not surprising that it was a frequent subject in the dramatic games of both children and adults alike, although in the latter an element of parody was often apparent. An interesting eye-witness account of one such wedding game played with dolls by seven small girls from the village of Kholm in 1928 is given by I. M. Levina in an an- thology of ethnographical material from Northern Russia.8 One</page><page sequence="5">Elizabeth A. Warner 155 is immediately struck by the intense seriousness of the players and their strict attention to the minutest details. Not only did they accurately reproduce all the important characters, speeches, songs, and formal scenes of this highly complex ritual from the arrival of the match-makers to the wedding-day feast and the post-nuptial trials undergone by the young bride in her new mother-in-law's household, but they had clearly absorbed from the attitudes of their elders something of the ritual significance of the performance. Their allocation of roles to the dolls, for example, showed a correct understanding of the focal position of the bride and her entourage as opposed to the more passive role of the groom's faction. On the male side we find that only the groom, his parents, and the best man (tysyatskii) were rep- resented, whereas on the female side we find the bride and her parents, her godmother, three sisters, and a brother as well as numerous girl friends. A deep-seated regard for "correctness" is also felt in the discussion over which doll should play the part of the bride's godmother (bozhatochka). It was usual for a married woman to perform this function, so the girls chose "Natal'ya Nikolaevna," a doll which had already been "married" herself in a previous game. Her long hair had been carefully wound into the two braids denoting married status, and the head was covered with the specially arranged head scarf of the mar- ried woman (povoinik). There was some argument over the suit- ability of the doll chosen to play the bride's mother. Her pink dress (sarafan) was considered incorrect for a woman of that age. Similar attention to detail was noted in the preparation of the interiors. During the decoration of the bride's home prior to the first scene of the game - the match-making - someone placed a make-believe samovar on the table. It was, however, promptly removed, for the samovar was traditionally brought out only after the serious business had been concluded and re- freshments were offered in token of friendship and harmony. That children should incorporate parts of the marriage ritual into their play is not really so surprising, for apart from its more serious aspects - economic, social, and religious - it was a beau- tiful, moving, and memorable festive event. Stranger, however, for the modern European, was their interest in funerals. A death and burial element was quite common in children's games, as for example at the end of Kostroma, the Russian equivalent of the English game "Jenny Jones" or "Georgina" which died out</page><page sequence="6">156 Comparative Drama towards the end of the last century. One girl played the part of Kostroma, another the role of her nurse. A question and answer game followed. Kostroma's friends call to see if she will come out to play, but each time they are turned away by the nurse. At first Kostroma is too busy (chopping wood, spinning flax, going to Mass, etc.), then she is sick, dying, and finally dead. A mock funeral takes place, and Kostroma is buried by her friends. The funeral, however, often degenerated into an un- ceremonious scuffle as the children seized the defunct Kostroma by the arms and legs and deposited her noisily some distance from the game. Miraculously brought back to life, Kostroma then pounced on her friends and the girl she caught became the new Kostroma. More realistic representations of the funeral rites were also common. Levina, who recorded the game at weddings described above, also writes of funerals where a doll was buried in a specially made coffin to the accompaniment of traditional keening.9 In the past the activities of children and adults were not kept apart to the extent they usually are today, and imitative games were often of considerable importance as a form of preparation, both psychological and actual, for the life of adult society. Some games involving conventionalized imitation of specific work processes can be traced to highly practical origins, for in most non-literate societies the transmission of various skills was necessarily carried out on a "watch-and-do" basis. Many heavily stylized work games with symbolic gestures and movements evolved from the basic teacher-apprentice situation and were incorporated into the rituals of initiation and other ceremonies. In time, the evolving mimetic figures of the players often became so divorced from reality that the original func- tional intention was lost and only the ritual purpose of the actions remained. Such games were comprehensible only to the initiated who then had to reinterpret them for the apprentice- initiates. A classic example of the ritual transmission of work pro- cesses may be found in the initiation rites of the Poro Bush Society among the Mano people of Liberia. "Once the boys have been duly impressed by these rites, the process of instruc- tion begins, and they learn the details of agriculture, trades, herb medicine and the like. In the Bush model gardens are planted, and forges and other paraphernalia set –∏—Ä."–Æ Inade-</page><page sequence="7">Elizabeth A . Warner 1 57 quate documentary evidence makes it difficult to draw any definite conclusions about the presence of initiation ceremonies among the early East Slavs. However, there are clear indica- tions that small girls were initiated into the skills of spinning and weaving which were the main occupations of the Russian peasant woman at least until the Revolution. Indeed the do- mestic loom was retained in some villages until the last war. Fon Kramer's description of superstitions and customs in the village of Verkhotishanka (Voronezh government) around the middle of the nineteenth century indicates vestigial symbolic remains of initiation rites in the time honored tradition by which young women in the first year of marriage were obliged to spin, weave, and sew all the sacks and rough hempen material (vere≈•e) used by the family to store and protect produce. –ò Certainly, spinning was an occupation which was surrounded by a great deal of superstition, ritual, and taboo. It was con- sidered wrong, for example, to spin on Friday, the day dedicated to Paraskeva-Friday, patron saint of spinners. Any woman fool- ish enough to disregard this would herself be punished by blind- ness. In some regions of Russia the women also did not spin during shrove week; if they disobeyed, according to legend, mice would gnaw at the thread and the cloth would rot. 12 It was generally accepted that after spinning had been finished for the day, the work had to be left tidy and a prayer spoken over it. Among the most popular spring and summer entertainments of the girls and younger women of the Russian village was the performing of khorovods or round dances in which certain ac- tions described in songs were mimetically reproduced to a choral accompaniment. One of these, Len ("Flax"), reproduces in some considerable detail one of the age-old traditional occupa- tions of the Russian peasant woman; a young girl asks her mother to show her how to grow the flax plant and how to prepare it for weaving into fine linen. Len is performed by a choir with two soloists playing the parts of mother and daughter. It begins with an invocation to the newly sown seed; as the dancer sways and bends this way and that, so hopefully will the flax grow thick and abundant: Pod dubravoyu len, len, Pod zelenoyu, len, len. Uzh ya seyala, seyala lenok, Uzh ya seya, prigovarivala,</page><page sequence="8">158 Comparative Drama Chebotami prikolachivala, Na vse boka povorachivala: "Ty udaisya, udaisya,moi len, Ty udaisya, moi belen'kii, "Polyubisya, druzhok milen'kii!" (At the forest's edge, flax, flax grows By the green forest. I have sown it, sown the little seeds of flax, And as I sowed, stamping it down with my Boots and swaying from side to side, I said to it: "Now grow up fine and strong, my flax, Fine and strong, my white flax, To please me, dear little friend.") The soloist then turns to her mother and asks in successive couplets "teach me, mother, how to weed the white flax, how to pluck it, spread it out, dry it, brake it, skutch it, card it, spin it." The mother replies and shows through stylized body move- ments how each task is to be accomplished: Eshche tak da vot tak, chi dochi, Vot tak da chi dochi moi, Vot tak da golubushki, Vot tak da golubushki. (Do it like this and like this daughters, This is the way to do it little daughters, This way my darlings, This way my darlings.) 13 Songs of this kind were also sung during specially organized communal work activities in which the whole village would band together to help a local farmer or simply a neighbor with some extensive task requiring many hands such as the sowing of seed, haymaking, harvesting, or even the building of a new house or mill. The host on such occasions did not pay his work- ers but entertained them to a generous meal in the evening. Similar in content were work scenes in some variants of the dramatic spring game Kostroma which enjoyed a widespread popularity in Russia up to the end of the last century. Kostroma belonged to the spring cycle of agricultural rituals and was per- formed by the young women and girls of the village some time between Whitsun and the beginning of the St. Peter Fast (on June 29) . The nucleus of the game consisted of the following: A straw figure was made, dressed in female clothing and laid in a</page><page sequence="9">Elizabeth A . Warner 1 59 coffin. A funeral procession was formed, the women moaning and wailing as for a dead relative or friend. When the cortege reached the river the "corpse" was stripped and flung into the water. The basic elements of the ritual can be seen in the follow- ing description based on observations of the ethnographer P. V. Shein.14 In the vicinity of Murom (some 160 miles east of Moscow) and other villages along the banks of the Oka river, the "burial of Kostroma," or "farewell to spring," as it was sometimes called, took place on the last Sunday before the St. Peter Fast. The typical setting in which Kostroma was per- formed is evocatively painted by Shein: a warm summer eve- ning, the sun just setting, a slight breeze blowing in from the river, rustling the groves of birch trees around the village, in the distance the bleating of sheep. With the day's work done, the villagers gradually emerge out of doors - the older people to enjoy the last rays of the sun and to gossip, the young to sing and play games. At some point in the evening one of the young women suggests "it is time to bury Kostroma." There is some opposition from the more God-fearing members of the com- munity, since taking part in such ceremonies of patently pagan origin was much frowned on by the Church, even in the nine- teenth century. As one woman puts it: "My man told me it's a sin ... and when I'm dead and in the other place they'll pull my tongue out for it and make me lick a red-hot frying pan." She is overruled, and a laughing, noisy crowd of women, girls, and lads runs off to "bury Kostroma." A straw figure is made and dressed in a shirt and sarafan, on her feet shoes and on her head a scarf and garland of flowers. The figure is then placed in a wooden feeding-trough (koryto) which serves as a coffin. While this is being done, the girls sing about Kostroma, about how she was a merchant's daughter from Kostroma (a town about 140 miles north of Murom), about how she was given drugged wine at a party and subsequently died: Vdrug Kostroma povalilas': Kostromushka umerla. Kostromushka, Kostroma! –ö Kostrome stali skhodi≈•sya, Kostromushku ubira≈• I vo grob polaga≈•, –ö–∞–∫ rodnye - to stali tuzhi≈•: Po Kostromushke vyplakivati "Byla Kostroma vesel√°,</page><page sequence="10">160 Comparative Drama Byla Kostroma khorosha!" Kostromushka, Kostroma, Nasha belaya lebedushka! (Suddenly Kostromka collapsed. Kostromushka died. Kostromushka, Kostroma! Then people came to Kostroma To lay her out and place her in the coffin, And her family began to mourn And weep for Kostromushka. "Kostroma was gay And Kostroma was pretty!" Kostromushka, Kostroma, Our little white swan.) The funeral procession is acted out with that peculiar mixture of grotesque and yet "serious" parody typical of those cere- monies known throughout Europe in which rituals connected with marriage or death are imitated. The women wear white head scarves to show they are in mourning, and the inclinations of the village lads to play the fool are sternly quelled. The young men who carry the coffin wear rough garments of sackcloth, another sign of mourning. The procession is headed by a mock priest, swinging a bast shoe in grotesque imitation of the ecclesi- astical censer. A group of girls depicting the professional keeners sing: Kostroma, Kostroma, Ty naryadnaya byla, Razveselaya byla, –¢—É gul'livaya byla! A tepe≈•, Kostroma, –¢—É vo grob legla! (Kostroma, Kostroma, Once so smart, Once so jolly, So fond of making merry, Now you have lain down in your coffin.) The ceremony ends on the banks of the nearest river or lake where Kostroma is undressed and flung into the water. This basic framework for the game was often expanded by the addition of other dramatic scenes. Most striking in this re- spect are variants of Kostroma recorded in 1940 by L. Kulakov- skii in the villages of Dorozhevo and Domashevo in the Bryansk region roughly half-way between Moscow and Kiev. One of the</page><page sequence="11">Elizabeth A . Warner 161 central themes of the play here was the mimetic reproduction of the actions of spinning a hank of tow into thread and then weaving it into cloth. In the Dorozhevol5 variant, which was in the form of a round dance (khorovod), Kostroma sits on a rug in the middle of the ring. The chorus addresses her: Kostryma, Kostryma, My lady Kostryma! Kostromushka has kisel'16 made with milk, Kostromushka has pancakes with curds [tvorog]. Good day, Kostroma! Good day to you! What are you doing? A series of answers follows, describing the spinning and weaving process from preparation of the flax, retting, braking, skutching, and carding, through the spinning of the yarn, the setting up of the warp on the loom, the weaving of the cloth, to the cutting of the finished material off the loom and the final beating and laying out of the prepared material. The original functional/ritual purpose of this game in the village of Dorozhevo became enriched over the years with the addition of purely entertaining episodes of a comic and fre- quently ribald nature. Thus, where in other variants of the game, including those from the neighboring village of Dom- ashevo, Kostroma simply dies and is buried with or without a mock funeral, in the Dorozhevo variant we find a whole socio- domestic comedy. When the hard work is over, Kostroma and her husband have a hearty meal and a half -liter of wine or vodka (the food was real and actually eaten, although the wine was only water), after which Kostroma falls ill with a stomach-ache. A wise-man (znakhar') is summoned from the neighboring village of Komyagino, some 40 kilometers from Dorozhevo. (According to Kulakovskii, in the past there was indeed a pop- ular wise man living there. This was not an unusual feature of Russian village life, certainly before the end of the nineteenth century. Indeed, until the spread of local medical services in the 187O's the wise man or woman performed an essential function. Such persons had certain medical skills in bone-setting and herbal remedies as well as more sinister powers displayed in the making of love potions, in the finding of lost or stolen property, or in warding off the evil eye.) However, the wise man proves to be away from home, so the local medical auxiliary (fel'dsher) is sent for instead. He enters dressed in an apron or with a white</page><page sequence="12">162 Comparative Drama tablecloth round his middle and carrying a stick to represent his stethoscope. One can well imagine that the comic and bawdy potential of the scene in which he questioned Kostroma about the nature of her illness and the way in which he sounded and examined her was exploited to the full. The local men tried to forbid their wives taking part, and more decent versions were presented to visiting ethnographers as well as, indeed, to the astonished and delighted Moscow audiences before whom Kos- troma was performed for the first time in 1940. The doctor eventually gave Kostroma a powder to take and departed. He was succeeded by the village priest (pop) who carried out a parody version of the Orthodox rite of soborovanie, "anointing of the sick" (or podzaborovanie, "under-the-fence-ing," as it is punningly referred to here, playing on the closeness of the words sobor - cathedral and zabor - fence in Russian). The priest was dressed in an old padded coat fitted at the waist and an old hat turned inside out. He had a cross made from bits of wood and an incongruous and highly original censer - a stuffed duck or grouse used by hunters as a decoy and swung by the neck. The language of the improvised parts of the play was fairly spicy, particularly in the scenes with the doctor and in Kostroma's confessions to the priest who absolves her "In the name of the oats and the hay and the holy chaff" ('Vo imya ovsa i sena i svyatogo Khobo≈•ya).l7 The connection between the straw figure of Kostroma and the spinning interludes of the Bryansk region is not immediately apparent. But Kostroma is clearly one of those anthropomorphic spirits of vegetation and growth which occur so frequently in Russian agricultural ritual. The word Kostroma itself is prob- ably derived from koster (or kostra) the stalk or boon of the flax plant. Vegetation figures were often made of materials other than straw, and it is probable that the original Kostroma dolls were made from this tough, strawlike residue of the flax or hemp from which the fiber had already been extracted to be spun eventually into linen. In the above excerpt the players were clearly trying to con- vey a reasonably realistic representation of the work processes involved in the game. The degree to which the actions of the players appeared "true to life," however, varied considerably from one type of game to another. In some the pantomime was reduced to an almost abstract pattern of formal gestures and</page><page sequence="13">Elizabeth A . Warner 1 63 movements. Such, for example was the series of khorovod-type games depicting the weaving of cloth recorded in the latter half of the nineteenth century by Shein. These took place in Trinity week during a spring festival which included such elements as the ritual ornamenting of a young birch tree with ribbons and the weaving of garlands for the purpose of divination. The dances began with the initial winding of the yarn onto the bean roll and the formation of the warp, and continued until the final process of weaving the material. The most striking feature was the design or pattern formed by the players. For example, the winding of the thread onto the bean roll was shown as follows: a chain was formed and the girls to begin with walked round in a circle, then the chain was broken at one point. The girl at one end stood still while the remainder wound their way round her, thus forming a spiral with the girl at its center. The weaving itself was done in a most ingenious way. The girls, standing in pairs facing each other, represented the weaving frame. Each pair crossed hands to form the warp. One girl standing at either end of the row was the weaver. To get the cloth woven a little boy was seated on the crossed hands of the first couple and from there tossed down the line to be caught by the weaver at the other end. He was the shuttle carrying the thread of the weft. 18 Mimetic dances of this type in which some activity or object is represented purely by the body movements of the dancers unaided by the use of costume, makeup, etc., may be regarded as one of the most primitive forms of dramatic expres- sion. It can be applied not merely to concrete subjects such as the art of weaving as in the above example, but also, more sur- prisingly, to relatively abstract concepts such as the dance imi- tating the surf of the ocean to be found among the Fiji islanders or the song of the Indians of the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico about the rising sun, accompanied by gestures to indicate the coming of dawn and the subsequent fertilization of the crops. 19 Similarly, the Onas of South America, who believed in the transmigration of souls into the heavens, the clouds, thun- der, mountains, stones, dark abysses, etc., strove to represent these natural phenomena in their masked dances.20 Primitive man's experiments into the realm of drama, as indeed into other art forms, were largely limited and conditioned by the pattern of his own existence and of the society in which he lived. In many primitive communities before the division of</page><page sequence="14">164 Comparative Drama labor into specific trades and other economic developments, people had little leisure time to devote to esoteric pursuits such as art and literature, since they were almost wholly occupied with obtaining food. Such conditions can still be found among economically backward, although not necessarily primitive peo- ples. Where art existed (or exists) in such communities, the impulse towards its creation was almost certainly of a predom- inantly utilitarian nature. Many of the art forms which are characteristic of particular tribes or communities originally had a utilitarian purpose. Such, for example, is the magnificent bas- ketry work of the Californian Indians or the pottery of the ancient Peruvians, old Russian house-carvings and highly decor- ated distaffs, or the intricate stylized embroidery with distinctive regional variations found on the festive garments and linen of the Slavonic peoples. However, while utilitarian (including religious/ritual) considerations were probably foremost in the mind of the primitive artist, it would be wrong to deny the existence of the aesthetic instinct which is also necessary to the production and enjoyment of true works of art. Ruth Bunzel suggests: "Most definitions of art presuppose the existence in man of an aesthetic emotion which can be evoked by the quali- ties inherent in objects or activities."21 However, she also states: "But it is nevertheless true that the greater part of the art o√≠ primitive man is applied to useful objects."22 The content of most early "dramas" among the Russians was also, as one might expect, derived from the world of their immediate material experience - a world largely concerned with the changing seasons, the growth and wellbeing of the crops (grain and vegetable), and animal husbandry. On a more per- sonal level, marriage and death (particularly the former) were either accompanied by or gave rise to a considerable amount of dramatic activity. 23 Hunting scenes are strangely conspicuous by their absence, although long after the Russians had settled as primitive farmers and herdsmen and ceased to rely on the hunt for food, fur-bearing animals such as the bear were still highly sought after for their pelts, a considerable source of revenue and commerce. But that the early Slav communities on what was later to become the territory of Russia did practice some sort of totemic cult involving the bear is almost certain, for it crops up again and again in superstitious beliefs and observ- ances recorded as late as the nineteenth century in situations</page><page sequence="15">Elizabeth A . Warner 1 65 related to marriage, sex, fertility of crops, the health of farm- animals, happiness, and good-luck. For example, a young couple leaving the church after their wedding were often made to sit on a bearskin rug so that they would have "as many children as there were hairs on the rug." The tame dancing bear frequently seen in the pre-Revolutionary village was led around the pea- sants' barns and outhouses to bring good luck; sometimes a piece of its fur was burnt and the smoke used to cense the house and farm buildings. A bear's skull was sometimes hung up in the stable, again to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals. In accordance with Frazer's principle of contagious magic, the properties of the bear itself could be passed through the wearing of its pelt (and later, by analogy, through other ma- terials, such as sheepskin, straw, or dried pea stalks) to a human actor portraying the animal. Masked bears of this type were a common feature of village mumming during the Christmas and New Year period in Russia from the earliest times and were believed to possess the same powers as the living animal; hence the village girls would try to dance with the masked bear in the hope of catching a husband. As the old rhyme says: Medveƒè pykhtun Po reke plyvet. Komu pykhnet na dvo≈ô, Tomu zya≈• vo terem. (Bear, the puffer, Swims down the river. Each house he puffs at Will gain a son-in-law.)24 The bear also appears in a mysterious role in several Russian folk tales which are clearly of ancient origin. There is the knight Ivan Medvedko (from medveƒè - i.e., bear) who is half human, half bear, and there are tales of encounters between bears and girls which hint at a half-forgotten belief in the possibility of mixed mating. Although ritual games specifically concerned with the hunting of the bear have not survived in Russia itself, ample evidence exists of their presence among neighboring peo- ples, particularly the various nomadic tribes of Siberia where the cult of the bear was highly developed and shows distinct similarities to the vestigial remains of these practices in Russia. When a bear was caught and skinned, for example, its head was boiled up and the skull hung on a nearby tree in the belief that</page><page sequence="16">166 Comparative Drama the bear's spirit would bring good luck to the participants in his funeral celebrations. Tribes such as the Man'zy and Ostyaks held protracted festivals in honor of the bear which included many specifically ritual ceremonies as well as feasting, dancing, singing, and the acting of scenes based on the bear-hunt itself, as well as on the life of the hunters in general and on other purely social or domestic themes.25 These scenes were acted out in the presence of the bear itself, or rather the skin, complete with head and claws, of the recently captured animal. This was ceremonially laid out in a place of honor. Rings were placed on its claws, silver coins over its eyes, and a muzzle of birch bark over its nose. This was done to prevent the women from either looking directly into the bear's eyes or kissing his mouth, an honor allowed only to the men. Hunting was a purely male pre- serve and only male actors took part in the games. In Russia too the divisions between male and female occupations were ob- served in the work-derived games, with men or boys playing the part of bear, goat, bull, or horse while the women, as has been seen, acted out their traditional role as spinners and weavers. The Siberian players wore grotesque masks of birch bark with eyebrows, whiskers, and beard blacked in with soot. They wore ordinary clothing but with garments turned inside out and a humpback added. Interestingly, this last detail was also a recur- ring feature in the appearance of the Russian masked bear. Among the scenes performed was one depicting the arrival of strangers at the feast in honor of the dead bear. They are sur- prised at the great crowd which has gathered and then, when they see the cause of it - the bearskin - they are terrified and try to escape. One, bolder than the others, eventually plucks up courage to kiss the bear's muzzle, and then everyone begins to enjoy himself. Another scene tells of three brothers, the young- est of whom is an idiot, who go out to hunt for bears. They eventually find a bear's den, but unfortunately their attempts to trap it are unsuccessful and it mauls the middle brother to death. The youngest escapes up a tree, which his elder brother proceeds to chop down, bringing tree and brother crashing to the ground. There follows a variant of a scene frequently found also in Russian ritual drama and the folk theatre - the resurrection of the corpses by literally blowing the breath of life into them through some bodily opening, usually the mouth or an ear, but</page><page sequence="17">Elizabeth A . Warner 1 67 in this case through the anus. More closely connected with the origins of the bear cult itself was the acting out of a Siberian legend which told how the art and custom of hunting the bear originated. Two hunters came across a bear's den in the forest and, puzzled as to the nature of the animal and how to trap it, they were forced to seek the advice of a local wise woman. She explained in great detail exactly what had to be done. The hunt- ers followed her instructions implicitly, laying the foundations of what was to become a time honored ritual, and caught their bear (a log of wood wrapped up in a deerskin jacket). Finally they "skinned" it, leaving only the head and paws, and carried it home rejoicing. In general, imitation of the appearance, characteristics, and function in the life of the village of various animals both wild and domestic played a significant part in the development of drama in primitive societies. Animals were necessary for food and clothing to all except perhaps the most primitive food gatherers. Moreover, animals by their very nature were an ob- vious target for imitation. Their bright colors or distinctive markings, their powers of swift movement or great strength and all the often grotesque similarities and disparities between the world of animals and that of men were striking and relatively easy to portray. In their games, the Russians portrayed mainly farm animals - the horse, bull, and goat - who were not only useful to them for the obvious reasons, but also closely con- nected with ancient pagan beliefs and ceremonies associated with fertility, the dying and rebirth of nature. Many references to such maskings are to be found in Old Russian documents, mainly in ecclesiastical literature condemning the remnants of pagan practices among the Russians. In a codicil to the Russian law codes of 1636 we find an injunction against taking part in hobby horse games at Christmastide.26 Similarly, in Tsar' Aleksei Mikhailovich's order of 1648 the people are forbidden to wear masks or make hobby horses.27 The continued popu- larity of the hobby horse and the joyful atmosphere of celebra- tion and unharnessed enjoyment which surrounded it are attested by many descriptions through the centuries. E. Avdeeva, in her memories of a Siberian childhood at the end of the eighteenth century, recollects the coming of the Christmas hobby horse: "There was a rider on the horse dressed as a knight and with them were a lady and her cavalier. In the evenings they went</page><page sequence="18">168 Comparative Drama from house to house and wherever they entered there was sing- ing and dancing."28 A. N. Minkh, in his collection of Russian folk customs and superstitions, offers a description dating to 1863 of the hobby horse during the spring festival of Rusal'skoe Voskresen'e (mermaid Sunday) which took place in the Saratov government around the beginning of June on the Sunday before the start of St. Peter's Fast. The festival began with singing and dancing as the young people of the village gathered in the streets. The hobby horse, which made its first appearance in the evening, was made of straw and carried on the bent backs of two lads who "played" the legs in the traditional manner of the panto- mime horse. The animal was hung all over with bells and brightly colored scraps of cloth. Perched on top a boy of about fifteen made everyone laugh with his jokes. A large crowd, con- sisting mainly of women and children, followed, waving rattles and banging on basins and metal dampers from the stove. The procession made its way, wending an irregular course through the village and bumping into or chasing unwary bystanders, down to the river where the horse was cast into the water.29 In a sense the first performance of the play Artakserksovo deistvo represented a beginning in the development of the Rus- sian theatre, but in another sense it was not a true beginning. Behind the lavish excitement provided by the exclusive court theatre with its imported producer and actors and plays from biblical or foreign literature was another theatrical tradition, though unrecognized as such by the men who condemned it - a theatre which was an integrai part of the life of the people, which sprang from their immediate needs and daily activities. This moreover was a theatre which represented a continuity of tradition (in the sense that it reflected a style of life and concept of nature which remained essentially unchanged for centuries) in a way that the court theatre, dependent upon fashions in art and politics, could not.
