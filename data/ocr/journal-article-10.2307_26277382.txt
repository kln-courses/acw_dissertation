<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nature Imagery in the Théorèmes of Jean de La Ceppède Francis L. Lawrence IMAGERY of La Ceppède offers very rich connections on several levels of significance. The figurai interpretation from the Old Testament1 is a natural means of expression due to its origin in the basis of Christian faith and its use by exegetes from St. Paul onward, but even more natural in the framework of the epoch's religious view of the universe is La Ceppède's animal and phenomenal imagery. This view is epitomized in the celebrated treatise of Cardinal Bellarmine, De ascensione mentis in Deum per scalas creaturarum, which teaches that God created the world and its diverse creatures as His image and mirror so that man might form from them some idea of the goodness and per fection of the Creator. La Ceppède's nature imagery and the popular religious emblem books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries2 spring from the same theological attitude toward the world and the arts. The English emblem writer Francis Quarles professes, "An emblem is but a silent Parable And indeed, what are the Heaven, the Earth, nay every creature, out Hierogiiprucks and emblems ot His (jlory ! La (jeppede similarly affirms, "De miracles divers l'eternelle intendance / A lambrissé les murs de ce grand univers." 4 This particular aspect of the rhetoric of La Ceppède, then, is not simply a product of "labored and involved 1.

Unfortunately, any study of La Ceppède at this time must be handicapped by the fact that no complete edition of La Ceppède's work is available, though Librairie Droz is preparing a facsimile edition.

Isaac like Christ carrying wood for his own sacrifice, Naomi like Mary mourning her children are a triumphant but completed part of God's design, a static tableau in history (Christ "rem plit le crayon des antiques figures," I, ii, 25). On the other hand, the nature figures which become most abundant and complex in the Théorèmes' second part are the very fabric of the universe: pre-existent but designed for man; ever-present inexhaustible source of revelation; and even participant, with man, in the event of the Redemption. The description of the dawn of Good Friday is a striking example of "la rhétorique profonde" (Baudelaire's term for his own system of correspondances) which pervades the Théorèmes : "Tandis l'aube à regret sortant de la marine / Notre horizon remonte à pas mornes et lents : / Un crêpe basané voile sa tresse orine / Son front est nuageux : ses yeux sont distillants. / Ce noir matin..." (I, ii, 32).7 This might pass as a pathetic fallacy, a simple piece of strained fantasy, if the evidence of the entire Théorèmes did not make it necessary to admit that in the religious thought of the poet everything is a living testament to God, not only in the sense of a diffracting lens or dark glass through which the living man dimly sees a vision, but even as a concerned party under the same title as man in the drama of the Redemption. This fusion of the figurative and the proper sense in an anthropomorphic view of nature finds its justification 5. Mr. Evans' opinion, p. 287. Mr. Evans feels that the increase of nature imagery in the second part of the Théorèmes can be attributed to the failing powers of a man in his seventies: "The wit and intellectual inventiveness necessary to sustain the development of a complicated figurai art has flagged." It is necessary to note, however, that Mr. Evans does concede that the "new material" is in accord with the subject of the poets' meditation: "All nature is called upon to rejoice in its redemption." 6. Mario Praz in The Flaming Heart (New York, 1958), p. 206, contends that this view of nature is a universal "mental idiosyncrasy" of seventeenth-cen tury man. 7.

For creation was made subject to vanity — not by its own will but by reason of him who made it subject — in hope, because creation itself also will be delivered from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God. For we know that all creation groans and travails in pain until now" (Rom. 8:19-21). Thus nature mourns at the death of Christ (I, iii, 28). The sun sees its master on the cross : Il [le soleil] se fasche de voir sa teste environnée D'un brillant diademe, et dit passionné: Dois-je avoir de rayons ma teste couronnée, Voyant mon Créateur d'espines couronné? A ces mots il arrache avecques violance Sa flambante couronne, et despité l'élancé Dans les abysmes creux, soudain le jour s'enfuit. (I, iii, 65) The transition from light to dark is rendered here with great violence. To draw out the obvious interpretation, the sun as well as being literally itself is the symbol of Christ voluntarily casting His Godhead under the essential yoke of matter, death. The eclipse of the sun expresses at once the overwhelming spiritual importance of the Redemption and the terrible physical abasement of the crucified God-Man.8 The sun is a versatile image for Christ. His eyes are two suns which blind the Jews (I, i, 51) who are in turn, logically, owls which despise the light (I, i, 48). By virtue of their spiritual blindness, Christ's perse cutors are themselves a night and though, accompanied by a superfluous mass of lanterns, they take Christ in the midst of a literal night, it is "la lumière du monde / Qui parmi l'espesseur des tenebres reluit" (I, i, 75). In an anticipation of the Resurrection, it is predicted that the black efforts of the Jews' blind rage, able for a moment to darken Christ's glory, will disappear like a cloud at the rising of the radiant sun (I, iii, 96). Under the force of the same metaphor for Christ, Judas' heart is "un 8. This unresolved tension emphasized throughout the first part of the Théo rèmes places La Ceppède's work firmly within the manneristic style if we accept the definitions of Ε. B. O.

Figures of eating connected with poison appropriate to the greedy traitor are also employed for Judas. His heart is "un crapaud qui les fleurettes change / En son mortel venin" (I, i, 44) and, in place of the lotus offered by Satan, he consumes the absinthe of black despair (I, i, 61). The group of metaphors utilized for the Jews derive force more from their reiteration than from any brilliant exploration of their possibilities. The predatory instinct is stressed. They are variously wolves, tigers, sav age mastiffs, but the nobility associated with lions is specifically denied them and they are most often simply dogs, "se n'ois rien que glapir ces chiens qui vous [Christ] aboient" (I, ii, 1).9 There is only one nature metaphor among Ruchon's selections from the first part which, I think, must be assigned a value principally decora tive rather than integral and expository. It is a full sonnet comparison of the flight and trapping of the apostles, when Christ was taken, to the flight and trapping of birds frightened by a stone tossed into their midst (I, i, 79). The analogy is an external, visual one and the intention of prettiness in the treatment is undeniable: "Des paoureux oiselets la troupe gazouillarde / Au simple mouvement, au moindre petit bruit, / D'un caillou, qu'un passant dans le taillis hazarde / Part, s'envole en desordre, &amp; s'escarte, &amp; s'enfuit." In the second part of the Théorèmes, where nature symbols displace biblical figurae as the primary means of exegesis, both the sun and pursuit images are expanded and reworked. The focus of the hunt shifts to the person of Christ: Le Cerf que le veneur relance au bois sauvage, Void un fleuve, s'y jette, nage, et gaigne le bord. Christ poursuivy de Juifs, nage aux eaux de la mort, Les passe, et vient surgir à l'immortel rivage. Le Cerf hayt le serpent,10 l'attaque, le ravage, Le mord et l'engloutit: Christ mortellement mord Le serpent qui fournit à la mort son breuvage : Céte mort engloutit, et destruict son effort. Il a (pour ce qu'il est le vivant et la vie) Céte mort devorée à son estre asservie, Comme l'estomach change en lait son aliment. 9.

(II, i, 50) Christ, glancingly characterized as the conventional Lamb in the first part (I, ii, 54 ; I, i, 95), becomes in this image of the death and Resurrection a stag of rich paradoxical significance. Christ is both the attacked and the attacker. Death is at once a neutral, even welcome, means to an end and a hated enemy to be destroyed. La Ceppède explicates stanzas one and two by the subjects Christ and death but the apparent identity of the terms bridges the transition between two domains. In the first stanza we are offered the surface drama of the Passion, the persecution of Christ by the Jews and His death of the body. La Ceppède carefully keeps this experience of Christ as man at the purely human level with no hint of the redemptive function: through death every man emerges into eternal life. The second stanza penetrates to the divine drama. We realize that by the apparent subjugation and retreat of the first stanza Christ as God has attacked and surmounted His enemy. On the physical plane, Christ assimilates and transforms death by His Resurrection in a glorified body. The scriptural associations of the serpent incorporate Satan into the death concept. La Ceppède may be said to have recast the archetypal Redemp tion image: the first scriptural prophecy of the Redemption is God's admonition in Genesis to the serpent that the seed of the woman shall crush its head (Gen. 3:15). Moreover, since death is a punishment for original sin, Satan by tempting Eve to eat of the apple may be said to have provided death with its poison. On the historical level then, the dominion Satan gained over the human race through original sin is destroyed by Christ's triumph. The significance of the image in the domain of the individual soul can be found in me fact that spiritual deatn is sin. According to St. Paul (Rom. 6:3-18) each Christian is united with Christ, through Christ, in His death and Resurrection by baptism, a death to sin, a rising to new life. Death, sin, and the serpent image are all closely associated by St. Paul in his exposition of the final resurrection of the dead, "Death is swallowed up in victory! Ο death where is thy victory? Ο death where is thy sting? Now the sting of death is sin..." (I Cor. 15:54-56). The image of the first tercet, though it might strike some as too graphically physical for this subject, can be interpreted as a genuine equivalent of the poet's belief, its transformation into the lan 252 Winter 1966</page><page sequence="6">Lawrence guage of metamorphosis. If Christ changes bread and wine into His Body and Blood, then it is only an imaginative extension of this principle to picture death as food changed into milk. Christ's death is converted through His Redemptive power into a source of grace which is spiritual nourishment for the entire human race. There is, again, a possible signi ficance for the individual sinner. Both Christ (Luke 7:47) and Paul (Rom. 5:20) point out that love, or grace, abounds in proportion to the sin abjured. So in each Christian his personal sin may be through the redemptive power of Christ transformed into a proportionate amount of grace. The image may also be taken as a tribute to the common medieval notion, "O felix culpa." Original sin as the occasion for the Incarnation and Redemption bringing man and God into a new, more intimate, rela tionship is transformed into a happy fault. The last tercet focuses again on the stag itself. By relating it to the stag of the Song of Songs (2:9-17), the scriptural work wrought all in nature images, Christ the lover of His Church and of each soul is evoked. Through adroit manipulation of the nature image, the poet telescopes the drama of the Redemption into this single sonnet which begins with Christ's human suffering and ends with His divine motive. The sun image has three full sonnet exploitations, no one so multi valanced as the stag sonnet, but each powerful in its own right. "Céte brilliante nue" (II, iii, 10) which wreathed Christ's feet at His Ascension becomes a figure of the way God reveals the divine mysteries to us, neither too obscurely nor too openly, as a cloud penetrated more or less by the sun seems now light, now dark. An analogy between the stages of Christ's life and the signs of the Zodiac openly and explicitly advances the hypothesis of a sacramental universe. Christ is "ce grand Soleil de qui l'autre n'est qu'une flamme" (II, i, 43). In another effort to "déchifrer ce grand hiéroglyphique" (II, i, 49), a comparison ingeniously paralleled in all its elements is made between the flower drawn out of the ground by the rays of the sun and the body of Christ drawn from the tomb by the sun — ambiguously the dawn of the Resurrection morn, or Christ. Both as a natural mystery and as a central Christian mystery the Resurrection is the object of several deciphering essays based on the mar vels of nature. The same technique is used to explore the obvious parallel in the individual Christian's spiritual life: the survival of the soul after death.

(II, i, 47) This sonnet on vegetable and inanimate things and another on animal phenonema (II, i, 26) present an interesting parallel to the anti-Ciceronian prose style which Morris Croll has convincingly argued is the character istic Baroque mode of expression.12 Successive phrases present, not new information, but new views of the same truth accumulating to make one rich apprehension. Following the common examples, La Ceppède pro duces an obscure marvel of nature which though fantastic is irresistibly appropriate. The flame image for the soul is a lesser reflection of the dominant figure for Christ — the sun, light of the world, thread that runs through the sonnets. The water that causes both death and new life recalls sonnet 40 where the poet pictured the soul in the water of baptism dying to sin but reviving to a new life and it foreshadows the use of water in the stag sonnet, number 50 of the same book. The often anthologized Phoenix sonnet is another example of La Ceppède's adroit use of the fabulous natural history of antiquity which was also a favorite point of departure for emblem writers. In his last important group of nature parallels, La Ceppede abandons the imposing, noble, and miraculous in nature to take homely cultivation metaphors for the work of the Church and man's life of grace under her guidance. Baptism is the Church uprooting the soul to replant it in holy terror (II, i, 40) ; the descent of the Holy Spirit fecundates the earth with The poet found this marvel in a passage from St. Ambrose's De Mirabilibus Mundi, chapter 3, on "une fontaine de telle nature que..si le mesme flam beau esteint est replongé dedans, le voilà tout aussitost sortir vivement r'allu mé."

The mysteries of the faith are explored, the work of the Church is figured, and finally the mission of the poet is defined through nature. By the creation analogy even "céte humble poësie" (II, iii, Vœu) attains a stature impossible to "prophanes Amphions qui n'employés la Muse / Qu'à chanter d'Helicon les honneurs mensongers" (I, i, 6). The Christian poet may propose, "Seigneur, si vostre souffle à ce coup la seconde, / Elle fera cognoistre avec estonnement, / Vostre puissante dextre en mer veilles fécondé" (Π, iii, I). The poet then becomes, by the grace of the Prime Creator, a secondary creator. His intent is not only the making of an object pleasing to God, "guirlander son chef de mille et mille fleurs" (II, i, 1), but partakes in the very aim of the original creation: Donnez moy la vertu, non de pindarizer Mais d'élever ma voix pour evangelizer A qui, quand, et comment il a voulu paroistre. Ainsi puissent tousjours ses palmes réfleurir, La Synagogue ainsi vienne le recognoistre, Et Chrestienne adorer cil qu'elle a fait mourir. (II, ii, 1) The function to which the author aspires for his art is parallel to the function he ascribes to nature. By God's power, the poet fashions a sen sible object and his work, like the material universe which is God's work, is made in order that it may reflect the glory of God and serve as a medium through which the Christian can recognize and adore God. The nature imagery of La Ceppède is then a true incarnation of the spirit of his poetry. God has written on "the walls of this great universe" ; the poet's task is to decipher that code. But nature is not only a clever conundrum ; it is a bridge. Matter may be the veil between man and the spiritual; it is also the most appealing and accessible way for man to approach the spiritual. The aesthetic method calculated to engage the reader for God is to cause "ses palmes réfleurir." Through a consideration of La Ceppède's nature imagery, it is possible to arrive at a keen apprecia tion of the tension in his work between matter and spirit, of the yoking of the aesthetic and the moral, and of the poet's manneristic consciousness of both the power and the limits of concrete imagery.
