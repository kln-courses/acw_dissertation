INTRODUCTION Several recent famine studies (Sen, 1981; Garcia, 1981; Alamgir, 1980; van Apeldoorn, 1981; Dando, 1980; Greenough, 1982; Franke and Chasin, 1980) reflect sustained scholarly interest in a process greatly impeding the fight against poverty in poorer countries of the world. There is less research today, however, than there was following the global drought of 1968-1974. With the culmination of this trend it is time to assess what we have learned about food crises and social processes. This survey examines the research literature by concentrating on fun- damental questions regarding famines: why study them? how extensively have they been studied? what are they? what causes them? and how can they be controlled or prevented? My analysis focuses primarily on published so- cial scientific research on the Third World famines which have taken place since the Bengal disaster of 1943-1944.2 ' Department of Sociology and Anthropology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Vir- ginia 26506. 2Because published famine research constitutes a voluminous literature, I am restricting my ahal- ysis to crises in which climate plays a more important catalytic role than war. Climate-induced famines have received more attention from social scientists. The Bengal famine occurred when the Third World nations began accelerating development programs. That famine has been more thoroughly studied than local episodes of food crisis anywhere else during the twentieth centu- ry. My time frame, therefore, stretches back no further than this. 227 0300-7839/84/0900-0227$03.50/0 (C 1984 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">228 Torry WHY STUDY FAMINES? Famines do great damage to individuals and their communities, and are thus compelling to study. For example, although famines do not neces- sarily kill, high mortality rates persist as a diagnostic in certain regions of the world. As many as 3 million people perished during the Bengal famine of 1943-1944. The drought that swept Africa's Sahelian belt in 1968-1974 took over 100,000 lives. Further, some 10,000 persons died when millions of acres of Bangladesh cropland flooded in the early 1970s. The economic and social disruptions which famines create may not project as vivid a pic- ture of devastation as demographic reversals, but must be considered at least as important. For famine-stricken villages included in his economic survey, Alamgir (1980) reported destruction of 25Wo of all livestock and dis- tress sales totaling almost 3Wo of farmland owned by poorer peasants in the aftermath of the 1974 Bangladesh floods. Starvation and disease accom- panying the Sahelian famine cut back cattle holdings of many nomadic peo- ples by at least one-third (Berg, 1975). In villages of Palamau district surveyed by Singh (1975, p. 233) during the 1966-1967 famine in Bihar, In- dia, land mortgages rose by 2040Wo over 1964 (normal) levels, and by 1710Wo the following year. There was an increase in land sales of 33Wo in 1968. And Mahalanobis, Mukherjea, and Ghosh (1946, p. iii) reported that 1.6 million families, or about one-quarter of prefamine paddyland owners, "had either sold in full or in part or mortgaged their land" during the course of the Ben- gal famine of 1943-1944. Livestock mortalities in Somalia, climbing through a succession of droughts and wars in the late 1970s and 1980s, have swollen the refugee camp sector to between one-quarter and one-third of the entire population of the country (Magan, 1983). Famines wreck or retard development programs. Depopulation result- ing from high mortality rates and outmigration compound obstacles beset- ting anticipated or ongoing development projects by altering the demographic composition of a region. This diminishes the income earning power of families suffering a loss of an actual or future member of the labor force. Famine relief costs thwart development programs also. In India, for example,3 special commissions of inquiry assessing famine relief expendi- tures and state and central planning reports for Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan document several years between 1964-1974 where appropriations ranged from 40% to over lOOWo of the states' annual de- velopment outlays.4 This is to say nothing of revenues lost through the can- 3Throughout, I lean on Indian data for illustrating certain points, since documentation of In- dia's long administrative experience with famine is more complete, by a wide margin, than is the case for other countries. 4These statistics were gleaned from state planning commission reports.</page><page sequence="3">Research on Famine 229 cellation of tax levies. Central relief expenditures amounted to $196.3 million in 1972 against the $584.2 million appropriated for the 1971-1973 agricul- tural budget of the entire Indian nation (Nicholson et al., 1979, p. 274). In the final analysis, it can be said that institution-building programs omitting contigency planning for emergencies5 may suffer punishing setbacks (Lewis, 1977). And planning usually profits from social scientific research. Famines can make another claim on researchers' attention because of rare opportunities they provide for setting up and testing social theories. A famine stretches institutionalized behavior to its limits, revealing the extent of receptivity of social organizations to new ideas and exposing the strengths and weaknesses of moral and legal controls of society over in- dividuals and groups under a full range of conditions of risk and stress. This point requires no elaboration, since much the same has been said for virtu- ally all types of general catastrophe (Torry, 1979; Mileti, Drabek, and Haas, 1975). THE EXTENT OF FAMINE RESEARCH The social scientific community's reaction to the policy and theoretical implications of this subject in terms of empirical research is very limited. So meagre is it, in fact, that a book-length field study of the responses of either rural or urban communities to famine can be found nowhere in the literature (Currey, 1980; Luthra and Srinivas, 1976). Published accounts appear largely as article-length spinoffs of research carried out with other ends in view. Quantitative household surveys documenting crises-induced losses, sacrifices, and adjustments resulting from food emergencies are scarce and initiated principally within village India (Mukerjee, 1947; Mukerji, 1952; Bhaduri, 1945; Dandekar and Pethe, 1972; Jodha, 1975; Borkar and Nadkarni, 1975). Geographically, the literature skews toward the Indian subcontinent and West and East Africa, representing at least 80% of the regions where published postwar empirical studies of famine have been done. A few books and papers provide informative descriptions of line and fieldstaff operations of government agencies (Singh, 1974; Subramanian, 1975; Knight, 1954; Mathur and Bhattacharya, 1975). Valua- ble though these studies must be regarded, the format of their documenta- tion is programmatic, passing over particular strategy choices and contexts involving individual decision makers and the fan of consequences stemming from specific insights and decisions. Long-term societal impact studies are limited by what I estimate to be a total absence of longitudinal research on famine and social behavior. 51 use the terms "famine," "emergency," and "food crisis" interchangeably.</page><page sequence="4">230 I orr- Although external measures of relief now command a position of importance in the repertoire of community adjustments in most countries, the interac- tion of local institutions and government and voluntary organizations receives nowhere near the attention accorded it in other disaster contexts (Torry, 1978; Oliver-Smith, 1977). It is also worth mentioning that while fa- mine refugee camps accommodate hundreds of thousands of persons yearly (United States Senate, 1979), I have yet to see them examined in any sub- stantive field study. Finally, drawing heavily on government and interna- tional agency reports, quite a number of investigators have shown the political economy of international trade and food assistance to be a predispos- ing factor in the causation or aggravation of famine episodes (Lappe et al., 1980; Rothchild, 1976; Hopkins and Puchala, 1978), but this work is not em- pirical. If food crises oppress so much of humankind, and concomitantly, af- ford unique perspectives on the human condition, why do so few research- ers go out and study them? For one thing, field conditions are exceptionally difficult. People under grinding stress do not like being visited by interview- ers, and usually prove less informative, accessible, and cooperative than usual. Further, the delicacy, visibility, and scale of their missions make ad- ministrators and politicians feel more liable and sensitive than ever to charges of incompetence, coercion, and misconduct. Given the highly charged tenor of this situation, officials balk at encouraging research projects in any way calling attention to their own difficulties and mistakes. Even respected nationals encounter trouble obtaining research clearance (Alamgir, 1980). Then, too, one can appreciate the improbability of resid- ing on location when a famine flares up or the slim chance of breaking free of current commitments, acquiring research permits and funding, and settling in the field while events are still in progress. Several factors can be held to account for the paucity of post- emergency fieldwork. These include biases against gathering data on events beyond direct observation, the demanding job of disentangling famine stresses from other social forces converging on the recovering community, and largely ethically-grounded sensitivities about reopening wounds in- flicted by conflicts and disloyalties instigated during the crisis. Finally, I should mention one factor masking the identity of famine to the point of diminishing it practically to a nonproblem. It derives from the assumption widely held, but not always explicitly stated in the social sciences, that long-term average conditions dictate human adaptations rather than episodic extremes (Dunlap, 1980). Indeed, anthropology, as a discipline dedicated to the pursuit of evolutionary issues, has taken criticism recently for failing to pay sufficient attention to catastrophic events in modeling processes of social change (Torry, 1979; Vayda and McCay, 1975; Butzer, 1980). This tendency manifests itself in the famine literature too, in such assertions as "Famine is not a disease in itself, but the symptom of seri-</page><page sequence="5">Research on Famine 231 ous food supply pathology" (Hay, 1980, p. 88), or "Food crises do occur but they are often only warning episodes of a critical underlying trend" (Barr, 1981, p. 1087). Downplaying the importance of famine by assigning it a derivative quality would not be so much erroneous as misleading, for while famines certainly serve as pointers of deep-seated structural causes of deprivation, they most definitely play a role in their own right as prime movers precipitating social change. Good examples of this point appear in annals of Indian famine history. For instance, on central government's in- vestigation of the failure of the Bengal government to come to grips with the devastation wreaked by the Orissa Famine of 1866, Misra (1970, p. 268) notes: The entire issue of inquiry boiled down to this: how was the government of Bengal to be strengthened so as to enable it to deal with any state of emergency and the ex- tended function of such a state? Was it possible through a council form of govern- ment and a separate legislature, or through a Lieutenant Governor vested with executive legislation . .? He goes on to observe that: The story of the formation of Assam into a separate province is thus significant in that it shows how the failure of the government of Bengal in the Orissa famine lay at the back of the whole of its administrative reforms of the 1870's. The very crea- tion of the province proceeded against the background of that disaster. The famine codes of the 1880s and those which followed them over the next 20 years directly were behind expansion of roadways, rail networks, and large- scale irrigation projects, and were a chief impetus for establishment of a separate department of agriculture, major land reform legislation, and initi- ation of agricultural credit societies (Bhatia, 1967). More recently, food crises precipitating massive public relief efforts in India during the 1960s prompt- ed that government to usher in major agricultural reforms, including the in- troduction of Green Revolution technology (Headrick, 1973). Out of the droughts of the 1960s and 1970s have also evolved a number of nonemer- gency asset and employment-generating programs, such as Employment Guarantee Schemes, the Drought Prone Areas Program, and Food for Work Projects (Dandekar and Sathe, 1980; Jaiswal and Kolte, 1981). Many sweep- ing changes in agriculture and industry in the aftermath of the Sahelian fa- mine (Franke and Chasin, 1980) and in Chinese famines of the past century (Vermeer, 1977; Oi, 1980) have been reported. WHAT IS A FAMINE? Broad agreement exists that a crisis becomes a famine when it advances to the intermediate and terminal stages of a famine cycle. Just when a fam- ine begins, however, prompts extensive debate. Since famine onset becomes so critical a question both conceptually and in practical affairs, it comprises</page><page sequence="6">232 Torry the only definitional matter I take up here. This boundary acquires impor- tance from a policy standpoint by dictating when government and other relief instruments will take effect and, correspondingly, the scope of harm ex- perienced by victims as the crisis runs its course. Where the marker touches down depends in fact as well as theory upon (1) which population sector is judged critically risk prone from the crisis itself or from political backwash effects of intervention, (2) criteria chosen for designating and measuring risk and damage, and (3) on whose authority the term famine stands. Three particularly relevant groups which take part in conceptualizing famine risks and dangers as expressions of political reality are government leaders, concerned scholars, and community representatives. All three ad- vance positions rationalizing the costs and benefits at stake for risk-bearing parties. Famine, it must be understood, consists of estimates about danger negotiated among different interest groups. These groups have diverse assumptions about what these dangers are. In short, "what a famine is" de- rives from these assumptions about danger. Many students of famine write as though the fate of people struck with- in the famine zone were all that critically mattered. An administration's po- litical safety must also be taken into account. What motivates government intervention? Administrations respond to signals auguring an extreme situa- tion where actual famine victims are concerned. In the minds of public deci- sion makers, extremity denotes abnormality. The official version of reality associates normality with self-help. A government will favor keeping the relief apparatus on hold, delaying its acknowledgment of famine, if it perceives that people are fending for themselves. Some administrations even use spe- cial tests for making this determination.6 The risks faced by an administration imperil its very existence. Much anxiety comes from pressures militating for decisive emergency measures (or for remaining discreetly inactive), exerted by many different advocacy groups. The point of intervention for government is fixed by the intersec- tion of strategies protective of its own survival on the one hand, and of the stricken community's well-being on the other. This very complex balance of considerations has been partially described in a few landmark case studies of administrative adaptations to famine crises (Singh, 1975; Subramanian, 1975). Ordinarily, researchers exclude government from the famine popula- tion. Perhaps this is as it should be by virtue of the precept that govern- ments exist for serving people.7 Researchers primarily look at demographic, 6For over a century, Indian administrations have gone about setting up small works projects at the very early stages of a drought, using the numbers of persons signing up for work as indicative of distress scales. 7But to the extent that research findings are policy directed, and hence prescriptive, excluding risks to government may be naive.</page><page sequence="7">Research on Famine 233 nutritional, and economic criteria to indicate the onset of a famine at the local level. Famine mortality, many argue (Alamgir, 1980; Appleby, 1978; Post, 1977; Cox, 1981), constitutes the one sure sign of passage from a state of chronic undernutrition to one of acute and epidemic hunger. This demo- graphic yardstick gives the appearance of being highly suitable in its unam- biguous specification of some extraordinary degree of suffering. But exceptional mortality rates, Chowdhury and Chen (1977) point out, come about during terminal stages of famine, after a community has already en- dured a battery of crushing setbacks. Furthermore, it is contended, propo- nents of this criterion saddle themselves inadvertently with the red herring of deciding how many dead bodies actually make a famine. Nutritional gauges of caloric consumption do possess the helpful quality of tracking directly a population's progressive slide into a starvation crisis (Morris, 1974; Bennett, 1968). And what is a famine if not this? The trouble with calorie counting and anthropomorphic measures, some have argued (Jodha, 1975), is that while signposting some universal standard of minimal nutritional needs, below which severely undernourished segments of a population drop, these biocaloric markers overlook life-quality condi- tions for the remainder of the popula,tion. Or, if this standard takes in rela- tively poor but not strictly destitute groups, comprising perhaps the majority of a population but excluding the penurious stratum, then the same criti- cism leveled at the demographic criterion would apply. Starvation or near starvation may not yield a timely warning of a rapidly approaching crisis, but rather speaks as a belated reminder of a situation already alarmingly out of control. Finally, nutritional metrics bypass variations in individual capa- bilities of "doing without." An economic approach toward delimiting the first stage of famine is spelled out in a series of influential papers written by Jodha (1975, 1978). Jodha reaches for a diagnostic closely in keeping with a local community's own adaptive goals and needs. He describes a sequence of adjustments uti- lized by Indian farmers and exhibited too, I suspect, by peasants in many other places. These include intensification of land-use practices, sales of jewelry, and migration. The "famine zone" approaches when families over a wide area begin sacrificing their livelihoods by mortgaging and selling productive assets as a way of meeting current consumption requirements. By putting these capital endowments on the line, both household and com- munity place their economic survival, a primary adaptive goal, in grave jeopardy. From his premises, Jodha concludes that government relief pro- grams must take effect at some point antecedent to epidemic rashes of dis- savings. But it must be pointed out that while Jodha's indictor may be quite responsive to hardships befalling landholding households, it bypasses the needs of asset-poor families, particularly those in the landless laborer category.</page><page sequence="8">234 Torry Finally, there is the view of tribal and peasant victims. When do they think famines begin? The question would probably mean little to such per- sons, because it is predicated on an equation between extreme and abnormal that stands outside the knowledge systems which have traditionally or- ganized their societies. The one exception is where indigenous states evolve special programs of intervention providing relief from extreme scarcities of food. Notable examples include the Moghul and Maratha administrations of India, the Hausa State, and a long string of Chinese imperial govern- ments. Administrations regard "abnormal" as the breakdown of local self- help mechanisms, which is to say that institutions under crisis, they assume, will malfunction.8 Preindustrial societies accommodate to dangers emanat- ing from a general crisis by manufacturing for themselves a good deal of potent chronic risk mimicking dangers generated in emergencies (Torry, n.d.). Hence, individuals caught fast in a famine do not act in a qualitative- ly different manner (abnormally in this case) from a nonfamine situation, but rather stretch existing norms to greater lengths than usual. To a great extent this happens through conventions selectively limiting individuals' en- titlements to life-supporting goods and services.9 Returning to definitions, I am not sure that appeals tendered by some writers (e.g., Dando, 1980, p. 58) for a standard definition of famine would be realistic or even feasible, except when the term extends over its broadest range of meanings. In its most general sense, which I adopt here, famine signifies some complex of extreme, large-scale suffering instigated by ex- traordinary constraints on food accessibility. When famine begins depends, first, on the population sector selected as a definitional locus, and second, on how far from a baseline norm of well-being it takes for its material con- ditions to be deemed critical. Different groups come into distress at differ- ent starting points and in varied ways. At a certain interval in the progression of a scarcity of food, it may happen that paupers start dying of starvation in excessive numbers, agricultural laborers go hungry, and small farmers sell or put into hock relatively big parcels of land to feed themselves and their dependents. That is to say that demographic, nutri- tional, and economic indices are each descriptive of some important aspect of a crisis. But onset also depends on what government wants famine to sig- 8Scholars also assert frequently that famines break down these structures of mutual aid. I docu- ment dozens of such claims in an unpublished paper (Torry, n.d.). But the point I want to make here is that famines can break an administration much more easily than they can destroy a local ethnic group (Greenwood, 1974). So extreme and abnormal, as far as an administra- tion's fate is concerned, may be identical, yet, it is not necessarily or even usually the case at the village levels, at least traditionally. " For example, wife and child abandonment by household heads, and refusal to share surpluses with kinsmen who have a legitimate claim to a portion of one's resources, are sanctioned by distributive justice codes of many emergency-stricken societies (Greenough, 1982; Torry, n.d.).</page><page sequence="9">Research on Famine 235 nify in terms of (1) help owed to famine victims, (2) its obligations to affect- ed groups situated outside the famine zone, (3) the relationship it has, and hopes to maintain, with foreign donors, and (4) its own survival instincts and imperatives. Hence, the nature of famine, in its full array of manifesta- tions, may vary strikingly, case by case, between regions, countries, and historical periods. WHAT CAUSES A FAMINE? Famine analysts usually favor one of a variety of possible instigating agents as the principal cause based on how far back they want the causal chain extended or the levels or units of organization in line with their dis- ciplinary/professional expertise. Over the years a number of explanations have garnered a measure of respectability. A few no longer command very serious consideration as prime movers, but still deserve to be mentioned. The time lag segregating cause and effect offers one straightforward way of grouping these explanations. Weather cycles, food supply and price oscillations, and information management failures come under the category of "proximate causes." Explanations involving concepts of political econo- my, on the other hand, bring to light historical changes in the distribution and gravity of risks. Both types of explanation will be considered. Proximate Cause Explanations Climatic theories, long holding favor in government circles (Bhatia, 1967) and still making an occasional appearance in the popular science liter- ature (Schneider, 1977; Brown and Finsterbush, 1972; Bryson and Murray, 1977) are now soundly refuted by a solid body of postmortem analyses delv- ing into every major stage of the Sahelian famine of the 1970s (Glantz, 1976; Caldwell, 1975; Dalby, Church, and Bezzaz, 1977; Garcia, 1981). Vir- tually all recent attacks on climatic theories marshal two very basic argu- ments. First, sharp climatic reversals, such as drought, may affect many regions concomitantly, but may set off a food crisis only in areas of relative poverty. Second, famines can take place (in noncombat situations) even when climatic conditions barely deviate from the trend line. In other words, famines are essentially man-made catastrophies sometimes triggered by cli- matic perturbations. Food supply explanations no longer enjoy wide currency. They stick to an outmoded notion of absolute shortage of supply (Dando, 1980; Ben- nett, 1968; Masefield, 1963) known now to be less a cause of famine than food accessibility constraints governed by grain price inflation, diminished</page><page sequence="10">236 Torry consumer purchasing power, transport snags, and the like. Recently, several famines have fully demonstrated that food crises can take place even when regional supplies decline very little or not at all. Supply-side explanations meet with further criticism on conceptual grounds for not even offering a theory of food supply decline (Sen, 1977). Modern famines, in Sen's (1977, 1981) opinion, are not mainly products of climate and result more from demand than supply problems. Legions of mostly abject poor and lower income households, accustomed to exchanging their products and labor for foodgrains through commercial outlets, experience steeply reduced levels of purchasing power, and wind up in desperate straits. Sen contends that people starve not because supplies disappear, but because market prices nudge supplies out of reach, as in the case of the Bengal famine of 1943-1944, the Bangladesh floods of 1974, and the drought flattening Ethiopia's economy early in the 1970s. Sen marshals time series data on district- and region-wide wages, prices, and quantities of major cereal crops. He then puts this information in the context of weather, transportation, and other constraints acting on supply and de- mand, to show in each case how people can starve when food accumulation over a region is on par with or even in excess of quantities on record for years preceding the famine. In the sense that exchange entitlement declines, as Sen dubs them, bulk large in most famine episodes today, his thesis commands respect; in- deed it has made a marked impression on the thinking of students of this subject (Greenough, 1982; Alamgir, 1980; Stewart, 1982). However, I would like to add to his understanding of the concept of supply. Supply downturns, or food availability declines (FADS) in Sen's words, signify "a sudden sharp reduction in food supply in any particular geographic locale" (Sen, 1977; p. 34). I believe Sen has in mind a supply zone ringing a food deficit area and connecting up with it via a network of operating transporta- tion links. No matter how far below the norm supplies plummet locally, a FAD situation cannot exist, in Sen's view, as long as a safety net lies waiting in the wings, that is, within the external zone of supply. Proposing that local scarcities may be of little account in themselves is tantamount, in my judgment, to disregarding the fact that local short- ages, as a rule, send foodgrain prices soaring in the first place. Food brought into deficit regions from supply zones would, moreover, be very costly in instances where household savings already hover on the verge of depletion from inflated prices of locally diminished supplies, and where credit rates have escalated even before replenishment stocks move into local markets. Furthermore, with so much attention focused on factors of distri- bution, Sen loses sight of the local producer's economic strategies and con- straints as variables governing a "locale's" food scarcity position, as if food production plays little or no role at all in the making of a famine. In short,</page><page sequence="11">Research on Famine 237 Sen omits important content from his scheme by denying himself enough theoretical ground for pinning down regionally stratified interactions of supply and demand, or of production-consumption-distribution. I must state firmly that my critique of Sen's enlightening arguments is offered more to caution against going overboard championing the purchasing power fac- tor as a causal agent than as an effort per se at discrediting its obvious value. Famines are a result of scarcities of food, purchasing power, and in- formation (Currey, 1981). For researchers, the third proves the most elusive of the lot and for me the most difficult to characterize. This is so because intelligence"0 and social organization are conterminous, and famines forge a great many organizations from households up to national and internation- al institutions into vast information nets so complex that sorting out chains of events leading to failures of intelligence is no easy matter. Relevant units of information and processes of communication are, moreover, harder to measure than prices, income, assets, and food. Research on intelligence comes in two forms. Prescriptive studies draw up conceptual guidelines and technical procedures for enabling large agen- cies to design survey, surveillance, and monitoring devices that capture and manage usable data. These data can be diagnostic of a single indicator, such as rainfall or caloric consumption, or the forecasting/monitoring apparatus may be constructed for spotting stress signals of many different kinds simultaneously. Such is the capacity of food security systems being devel- oped by FAO (Binder, 1978) and by many national and regional govern- ments including Botswana (Kreysler, 1979), Ethiopia (Gebre-Medhin, 1977), and India (Tandon, 1976). Descriptive studies record intelligence system performance as it tests out in actual situations of stress. One major area of investigation, enriched by field studies conducted largely by anthropologists and geographers, con- cerns hazard management methods utilized in tribal and peasant societies. Very little of this work is undertaken by researchers looking primarily at famine. But it does describe the detection, interpretation, and transmission of early signs of danger. Divination (Gluckman, 1965), soil analysis (Scud- der, 1962), observation of river flows (Gluckman, 1941), and forecasting market prices (Barlett, 1980) comprise some of the guides cautioning popu- lations to gradients of risks to their security. The adaptive outcomes of risk management and production usually remain implicit in these ethnographic descriptions, precluding any confi- dent estimation of the effectiveness by which indigenous institutions ward off famine. Still, such documentation does reveal something conspicuously 0I use the term "intelligence" in a general sense of meaning detecting, collecting, analyzing, and reporting information.</page><page sequence="12">238 Torry lacking in the second body of work I turn to shortly. Utilizing assorted in- dices of risk and safety, risk managers in many modern organizations must come up with a clear idea of the levels of danger facing them at every stage of a developing crisis. A significant contribution afforded by studies of lo- cal risk management strategies is their explication of the ways different data series are conceptually connected, allowing household and community deci- sion makers a coherent, continuously correctable model of crisis causality. Witchcraft/sorcery ethnography is notable in this regard for showing how stresses originating in both the social system and the physical environment interrelate through encompassing sets of moral categories, such that drought, for example, becomes intelligible as the consequence of certain ac- tors having transgressed social norms (James, 1972; Krige, 1970, p. 242). Few studies describe famine intelligence systems, organized by the state or through international channels, in action settings. Probably the most comprehensive piece of documentation of this kind is Singh's (1975) chronicle of the use of a communication grid laid out by provincial and cen- tral authorities for administering relief during the famine of 1966-1967 in Bihar, India. Singh charts out, in this detailed account of one of the most experienced famine relief apparatuses anywhere, the emergency duties devolving on functionaries at all levels of government, takes note of offi- cially sponsored surveys of public nutrition, health etc., and unravels com- munication links and nodes incorporated into the production and dissemination of famine intelligence. In another well-known report, Sheets and Morris (1974) look primarily at how one agency delivered foreign as- sistance during the great Sahelian famine, as they draw on selected incidents and decisions in mounting a critique of USAID's ability to anticipate the real gravity of the crisis before it began to crest, and therefore to deliver aid in a timely manner. Both studies, and several others addressing this subject (Subramanian, 1975; Government of India, 1945; Shepherd, 1975), proceed retrospectively, reconstructing outlines of intelligence operations from documentary sources and sometimes from interviews and personal recollections. Salient causes of intelligence failure can now be summarized. What happens sometimes is that a bureaucratic agency lacks a conceptual grasp of the dynamics of famine and, led by false assumptions of causality, mis- perceives the danger signals that pass before it. Central and regional govern- ments alike mistook starvation deaths as manifestations of food shortage rather than connecting excess mortality with drastic reductions in purchas- ing power during the Bengal famine of 1943-1944 (Sen, 1981), and USAID's sluggish mode of action in the Sahel reflects that agency's perception of the famine as a "temporary climatic aberration" (Sheets and Morris, 1974, p. 18). Assistance, in addition, may be predicated on a definition of distress</page><page sequence="13">Research on Famine 239 too restrictive for inclusion of any but the direst and most spectacular evi- dence of suffering. Concealment and distortion of facts are widely decried. Just to mention a few of many situations reported, the victims are inclined often to exagger- ate their hardship which the press, if anything, also tends to inflate. High officials and politicians may suppress or "launder" information repudiating their leadership, and district administrators held personally responsible for starvation deaths and outbreaks of disease in their domains may do like- wise. Another problem plaguing many countries is the paucity of trained personnel or of financial resources enabling the careful accumulation and processing of high quality intelligence acquired from regularly updated sur- veys of key famine indicators. Complex organizational environments incubate contemporary fam- ines, and four aspects of this complexity are frequently cited for producing defective crisis intelligence. Famine detection depends, for one thing, on a multiplicity of distress indicators. India's famine codes (Government of Bombay, 1955; Government of Bihar, 1973), as a case in point, list factors as disparate as public unrest, unusual incidents of migration, rainfall, and excess deaths. Procedures for fitting together individual measures are made explicit neither in these codes nor in famine diagnostics employed in other countries. The synthesis of heterogeneous data sets seems to be highly intui- tive, even capricious, requiring comprehensive models of social system dy- namics transcending the analytical horizons of agencies that live routinely by facts and figures. The sheer diversity of organizations drawn into a famine creates another troublesome feature of complexity, since each one formulates a separate version of identical circumstances around problem types coinci- dent with its own narrowly bracketed terms of reference, e.g., improvement of rural credit, public health, or water resources. A third facet of complexi- ty relates to the multiple guises famines are capable of assuming. Famines induced by floods and by drought present distinct configurations of causes. So too do famines instigated by only one kind of catalyst, if its recurrence interval runs over a period seeing a succession of major social and ecologi- cal changes. Finally, there is the instance of several ethnic groups coexisting within the jurisdiction of a single administrative regime. A problem de- velops when the latter's crisis managers, working from a "canned" package of measures applied in blanket fashion, have trouble differentiating distress modes for populations displaying a range of social structures and subsis- tence patterns. The lessons famines afford should be scrutinized carefully by analysts and policy makers and programmed into a state's future development plans so precautions against repetitions of the crisis can be taken. The Indian</page><page sequence="14">240 Torrv government, for one (CIRTPC, 1971; Singh, 1975; Subramanian, 1975), in- itiates postdisaster audits of relief expenditures, appraises effects of its emergency programs, and even projects likely impacts of these programs onto long-term development strategies for eradicating the structural basis of famine. Unfortunately, the specific agenda set up by committees of in- quiry, data made available for their deliberations, biases and insights shap- ing their interpretation of facts, conclusions that they reach, and utilization of their reports in programs supposedly protecting people from famine have not attracted social scientific research. Therefore, little is known specifically about this important area of institutional memory-building. Historical Explanations A huge literature, discussed in a later section under the rubric "depen- dency theory," addresses the second group of causes, entailing historical de- velopments giving rise to the chronic poverty of which famine is a purported epiphenomenon.1I The theme of underdevelopment or marginalization runs through all of these studies. By building commercial and politico-legal links with capitalist power centers, lesser developed countries or regional or eth- nic subdivisions surrender part of their food-generating capacity. Typically, colonial or neocolonial powers, represented by urban/industrial elites, initi- ate these links for purposes of extracting economic surpluses through taxa- tion, trade, land expropriation, and other means, in order to expand their power and wealth. Only a fraction of surplus extracted finds its way back to the grass-roots level for reinvestment in labor intensive food production projects restoring economic security to the masses of impoverished rural households. This genre of research talks mainly about vulnerability, which as- suredly is a basic famine ingredient. My complaint applies to the thinness of fact connecting vulnerability and occurrence. The actual event, the fa- mine, is usually of peripheral concern, being merely alluded to or described in the sketchiest of terms, while the burden of analysis concerns economic and political oppression antedating the famine. From the slenderest of evi- dence, the reader must infer both the sufficency and requisiteness of broad configurations of historical events for producing a certain pattern of conse- quences, namely famine, in empirical settings. One therefore is moved to wonder why all similarly vulnerable populations do not suffer famine equal- "Some outstanding examples of this kind of approach include Franke and Chasin (1980), Copans (1975), Greenough (1982), Bhatia (1967), van Apeldoorn (1981), and Wisner (1978).</page><page sequence="15">Research on Famine 241 ly.12 Bearing this in mind, I must confess my difficulty drawing clear-cut distinctions between political economies of famine and the general run of political economies which say little or nothing about this subject. Moreover, repercussions of famine per se on subsequent political and economic de- velopments in affected societies are pretty much out of view. Let me add though that I do not fault this body of work on other fronts, particularly its convincing demonstrations of how some groups make others poor and hungry, nor do I mean to imply a total absence in this literature of studies which tightly tether cause to effect, for there are some (Flood, 1976; Birks, 1977; Holy, 1980; Greenough, 1982). HOW TO STOP FAMINES Famines can be stopped through emergency intervention or kept from happening at all by going the route of sound development planning. I omit discussion of the latter in the little space remaining, as it embraces many issues unrelated to famine relief. Further, it is concerned with an enormous literature on social change to which little justice can be done here. A well-organized relief administration backed by strong, respected cen- tral and regional government bureaucracies is undeniably important. This is evident when comparisons are made of mortality statistics for pre- and post- war China and India or when postwar figures for these countries are com- pared with those of colonial and neocolonial African countries. Many governmental interventions have been tried with notable success especially in China and India. High mortality and migration rates have been contained by official procurement schemes aimed at timely foodgrain transfers from surplus countries and regions, and sometimes too from grain merchants and "Sen's (1983) comparison between Chinese and Indian food management systems makes this point very nicely. Normally the Chinese are better fed than Indians, more than a third of whom are chronically malnourished and undernourished. More equitable land holding laws, a more extensive and vigorous public food distribution system, and high rates of rural em- ployment existing in China help account for this disparity. On political economic grounds alone the Chinese would appear less vulnerable than Indians to the severest symptoms of famine. In fact, just the opposite is the case because India has developed a superior emergency relief apparatus and "a crusading press and hard-hitting opposition parties," lacking in Chi- na, that pressure the government into using this apparatus on a large-scale and in a timely manner. Over 16 million Chinese are estimated to have perished since 1959, owing to famine conditions, while there is no indication of more than a few thousand excess famine deaths in India for the same period.</page><page sequence="16">242 Torry wealthy farmers, to famine-afflicted locales. Often suspension or cancella- tion of taxes will be authorized, and bureaus of government and coopera- tive societies will issue low-interest loans for production and, less frequently, for consumption-based needs. Rationing schemes revolving around subsidized grain bought by eligi- ble persons at government designated outlets (ration shops) contend with the problem of diminished purchasing power. Low-wage employment on public works projects can hasten income recovery, and employment guaran- tee programs operate for promoting occupational placement and asset ac- cumulation. Relief camps offer displaced persons a survival stop-gap. Opening protected forest- and pasturelands may give starving livestock some relief and allow hungry persons a temporary source of food and sale- able firewood. Government-sponsored health, nutritional, and crop outturn surveys assist policy makers in identifying the most vulnerable sectors of the famine-zone populations. Coordinating local participation in relief efforts through village councils and voluntary organization fieldstaff is also under- taken by administrations of some countries. Many famine buffers, ranging from relatively low-cost relinquishment of luxury items to high-cost asset liquidation strategies, playout at the local level (Torry, 1979, n.d.; Swift, 1977; Jodha, 1978). At the international lev- el, money, food, technology, information, and expertise are made available to famine-stricken countries through bilateral or multinational agreements. International agency programs of relief and reconstruction assistance meas- ures take so many different forms that only a few can be mentioned here. The World Food Council's programs for building up a 500,000 metric ton emergency grain reserve and a minimum inventory of ten million tons of cereals for food aid (UN/WFC, 1978; Wallerstein and Austin, 1978), and the joint FAO/UNICEF/WHO project to assemble a global nutritional sur- veillance system for implementing the WFC resolution (WHO, 1976) may prove effective measures in the area of famine management. USAID and government agencies in other countries, sometimes working in concert with international charitable organizations, lay wells, firm up transportation and communication links forming grain distribution pipelines, and give medical assistance and other help. Moreover, in bringing the plight of famine vic- tims to the attention of the world, foreign media have on occasion set the stage for an international response (Shepherd, 1975). Unfortunately, next to nothing is known in detail about how satisfac- torily various emergency interventions and adjustments actually work, judged by any standard measure of effectiveness, for any sample of famine- affected households and villages."3 All that one can assert with confidence I3We are fortunate though to possess two published surveys documenting wages earned on relief works as a factor in the local adjustment process. Jodha's (1978, p. A-44) research on five drought-affected villages shows that small holders and laborers received wages averaging 5307o</page><page sequence="17">Research on Famine 243 when relief efforts are deemed successful is that some combination of government-supervised emergency operations prevents high rates of mortal- ity, massive village to town migrations, or extreme food price inflation in urban centers. This is not to say that graft, waste, maldistribution, and logistical obstacles go unreported. In fact, such claims abound. But they usually derive from hasty spot observations or hearsay that is nearly useless as a basis for reliably estimating harmful consequences for targeted recipients of faulty storage and delivery operations. Longitudinal pre-intra-post famine household surveys of relief, incor- porating comparisons of two or more communities in one of several con- texts, would be one way of narrowing the great gap in our knowledge of the effectiveness of intervention programs. These might include socio- economically similar communities affected with comparable force by the same perturbation, e.g., drought, where one serves as control and the other as a treatment (aid-assisted) unit. Researchers might test for interactions of assistance and economic mode, wherein one treatment community might be a village of horticulturalists and the other an encampment of nomadic pastoralists. The sample communities can also be varied by degree of vil- lage/market integration or many other factors. Whatever design is chosen, it must make use of very careful measures of famine losses and aid-secured gains, and, to the extent possible, isolate relief from other interventions. Hard data of this kind are prerequisite for scientific impact analysis of fam- ine relief. DISCUSSION Having already lamented the paucity of empirical studies of famine, stressing this negative theme again will accomplish little. Until we approach a critical mass of empirical social research, social scientists will have to ex- tract theoretical leads from existing data bases. My concluding comments, ac- cordingly, focus on the state of theory as it currently stands and on some important research horizons that seem within the reach of theory. General theory has not been a conspicuous part of famine research. Still, a careful reading of literature does turn up some widely scattered con- ceptual schema which I attempt to size up now. This heterogeneous collec- tion of frameworks can be subsumed, for convenience, into models of of the total cash inflow and that "farmers' adjustment devices ... would have completely failed to provide sustenance were it not for relief employment provided by government." Income earned on relief works within two villages surveyed by Borkar and Nadkarni during the Ma- harashtra drought of 1971-1974 accounted for 81.407o and 59.4Wo of total income and "in the absence of scarcity works, the households would have been reduced to starvation levels" (1975, p. 47).</page><page sequence="18">244 Torry famine vulnerability and models of famine adjustment. A third category covering reconstruction, and filling out a tidy pre-intra-post famine taxono- my, remains, as far as I know, enveloped by a theoretical void. Famine Vulnerability: Dependency Approaches. Dependency ap- proaches were critically assayed in a previous section for not forging a firm link between endemic poverty and acute hunger. One way to strengthen this link would be in the nature of equipping dependency models of famine causality with a sharpened theoretical focus. Practically all reviewed publi- cations (e.g., Meillassoux, 1974; Omvedt, 1975; Cereseto, 1977; Susman, O'Keefe, and Wisner, 1983; Watts, 1983) falling into this category, disap- pointingly, rehash conventional wisdom by holding, for example, that struc- tural poverty results from flows of profit in surplus labor from primary producers at the peripheries of power to merchants and industrialists at the center, or from unequal terms of trade between these points or sets of points. Meanwhile, no original theoretical insights have come forward from such generalizations. Indeed, dependency is a generic concept, or paradigm, within which "a number of competing theories and explanations of the na- ture of dependency" can be found (Roxborough, 1977, p. 120). By riding astride these generalizations, dependency exponents give vulnerability conditions a globally uniform appearance. But differences in the extent to which populations, classes, and ethnic groups suffer development-retarding setbacks (which render them susceptible to food crises) is part of the very stuff setting off debates resounding through the dependency literature. It would be of interest to know, for example, if a close examination of conflicting formulations of modes of production, con- nections between relations of exchange and relations of production, and the significance for the political economy of underdevelopment of such non- farm/factory resources as luxury items and information can inform our un- derstanding of famine causality. Several writers, furthermore, seem unaware of committing what many critics of dependency theories (Fried- mann and Wayne, 1980; O'Brien, 1975; Nash, 1981) regard as analytical solecisms. Take, for instance, the conflation of class and spatial attributes of economic inequality, evident in some of Wisner's papers on famine. (Wisner, 1977). Wisner, a geographer, blurs distinctions between social class (bourgeois and peasant) and cartographically illustrated center/periph- ery zones, bracketing three-fifths of the entire area of Kenya. A major source of confusion is that each zone aggregates multiple class types - hence the likelihood of one class spanning several zones. In the same vein, I can see no way that these models make class an independent and central theo- retical component. This omission leaves one with questions about the artic- ulation of social class and modes of production through such channels as brokerage and trade union membership, processes of class mobility, and the</page><page sequence="19">Research on Famine 245 complex dynamics of class inequalities, given that some classes concurrently exploit and are exploited by other classes. In summary, the biggest payoffs for famine research will come when macro-analyses of dependency match up with regional and micro- ethnography of famine vulnerability and famine occurrence. Then we can look forward to making credible predictions of famine outbreaks by analyz- ing interactions going on between external conditions of underdevelopment and internal, that is, village or organizational sector, processes. Famine Coping. Some approaches in this category fourmulate their terms of reference explicitly and some do not. In the first group fall, for want of a better term, response phase paradigms. In the second group are certain orientations concerning the scheduling and necessity of famine relief, for what they imply about the adaptive fitness of famine-stressed so- cieties. Response-phase models assume that all living systems pass through a sequence or hierarchy of adjustments, from relatively low energy, high flexibility strategies, to costly high energy, low flexibility reactions leading ultimately to system breakdown. These graduated processes are illustrated by a medley of physiological, psychological, and sociocultural studies of deprivation. Dirks (1980) utilizes research on everything from animal and human laboratory to concentration camp and agricultural village settings in adapting the psychologist Seyle's well-known General Adaptation Syn- drome model to famine situations. The model divides crisis response se- quences into alarm, resistance, and exhaustion phases. Laughlin and Brady (1978) present a loose clutch of propositions wound around a simple thesis: extreme scarcities, including famines, shrink networks of cooperation. At- tendant political ideological and cognitive repercussions include retrench- ment and simplification of ritual and other nonproductive activities, a conservative reaction against innovation, avoidance of long-range policy, and a hardening of political controls. Finally, reflecting an influence of evolutionary biology on ecological theories of anthropologists, Morren's (1980) scheme gives a very general characterization of risks that scarcity- stressed systems run up against as stress levels escalate. Abstractly, it relates risk levels, stress levels, and system levels (from least to most inclusive). Regarding the efficiency of intervention, for example, we learn that higher order units perform better than lower order ones the bigger the crisis, pro- tecting the latter in the short run, but diminishing perhaps their long-term autonomy or flexibility. Does famine relief do more harm than good? Strictly speaking, there is not much theory around to conceptualize, let alone to render a verdict, on this matter. Jodha (1975) and Morris (1974, 1975) have done as much as anyone to give the question an extensive airing. Although they occupy themselves more with policy than with theory, it is not hard to see a host</page><page sequence="20">246 Torry of conflicting theoretical assumptions below the surface of their arguments. Morris contends that the Indian farmer's adjustment to food crises includes dissavings of productive assets and migration, which signal adaptation rather than maladjustment. Famine begins only when migration and death are "on a scale that prevents maintenance and recovery of social relation- ships that have existed in the community. . ." (1974, p. 1857). Ordering in aid any earlier would be wasteful and unethical, penalizing other poor regions required to share relief expenses. Jodha stakes his rebuttal on the proposition that asset liquidation augurs social system breakdown. Drawing from his own asset surveys of Rajashtan villages before, during, and in the aftermath of famine observed in the early 1960s, he is able to show that farmers experience difficulty recouping productive capital after a famine runs its course. What is interesting here are two submerged, contrasting theories of community coping strategies. Morris's community system is homeostatic, maintaining a balance of costs and gains vis-a-vis nature. Asset depletion keeps the society in equilibrium; in times of plenty it builds up stocks, and in times of dearth it draws them down. Jodha sees peasant famine coping as less resilient, and therefore more dependent on government assistance. Moreover, each author advances different premises about peasant rationali- ty. Morris's peasants prevail over nature by rationally planning for uncer- tainty. Whereas his picture of community-environment interaction makes asset liquidation appear rational, Jodha reaches the opposite conclusion, further doubting rationality as sufficient in itself for keeping peasant com- munities afloat. These paradigms reveal formative efforts at building general theories of famine behavior. But they must be further developed before policy mak- ers take them seriously or before they exercise appreciable influence on reigning theories in the social sciences. One immediately notices the absence or virtual lack of representation of certain disciplines. For instance, Wells et al. (1983) note that not since Sorokin's Hunger as a Factor in Human Af- fairs, published more than 60 years ago, have sociologists "written a book devoted specifically to hunger," and "only a handful of sociologists have since written essays, book chapters, or research articles in which hunger is a main topic." Only anthropologists and geographers have contributed in this regard. Several writers must be applauded for looking beyond their discipli- nary parishes for new syntheses of complex data. Their frameworks, while broad, are so encompassing that few practical applications are suggested, nor can they generate theories to explain cross-cultural variations and regularities in crisis response. Surprisingly, not one researcher surveyed has shown any inclination to develop theoretical models within his own</page><page sequence="21">Research on Famine 247 discipline-and not because this is impossible. There is a family likeness evi- dent in the central place theories of the geographers Losch and Christaller and of the generic dependency paradigm adopted by Wisner. Similarly, an- thropological theories dealing with the moral anatomy of witchcraft and sorcery accusations or with exchange networks in tribal and peasant socie- ties have a lot to say about the management of risks in stressful situations for which analogues in famine settings can certainly be found. The value of famine research for social theory does not require elabo- ration, given that the extraordinary shock of famine experienced by a socie- ty inevitably reveals some infrequently observed facet of its dynamics. Rather, the way theory may improve famine relief policy is more in need of discussion. I will identify a few theory-worthy topics that relate to the principal components of the famine-management system, namely, the state administration and the local community or ethnic group. It would be a par- ticularly fruitful approach to work with models accounting for methods by which community and government, separately and jointly, handle routine problems of distributing scarce resources. It is probably distribution rather than the production of food (and other types of aid) which is the decisive factor in the management and intensification of famines. Local institutions and values mark the limits of sharing within com- munities. The boundaries and rules of mutual aid at the grass-roots level ought to be recognized by administrators for their potential "goodness of fit" with official distributive principles. Otherwise aid may end up in the wrong hands, from the vantage point of government welfarist goals, and stir up conflict between donors and recipients. Ethnographic theories of so- cial exchange may prove extremely useful for the predicting of intracommu- nity and neighborhood sharing and hoarding behavior, and may give the administrator guidance about the most effective venue and unit of food dis- tribution, e.g., the individual, family unit, or village organization. Discerning properties of development adminstrations as "soft states" would be one direction toward theorizing about the state's capacity to serve as an agency of famine control. Myrdal (1979) coined this term for develop- ing countries refering to "the various forms of lack of social discipline which manifest themselves by deficiencies in legislation and, more particu- larly, law observation enforcement, a widespread disregard by public offi- cials at various levels to rules and directives handed down to them, and often their collusion with powerful persons and groups of persons whose conduct it is their duty to regulate. . .." Official corruption, postulated by Myrdal as the leading reason for developing countries being soft states, may constitute the single most frequently heard criticism of government manage- ment of emergency relief. Soft state norms of conduct also hinder efficient and accurate collection, dissemination, and interpretation of information from the village or camp through ascending levels of state bureaucracy</page><page sequence="22">248 Torry necessary for the monitoring of distress condition within affected communi- ties. Soft states analysis in many different crisis contexts ought to be directly applicable to famine situations. Theories that explore the intersection of community and bureaucratic norms, policies, and methods of distribution will allow researchers to esti- mate with more confidence the fitness of individuals and institutions for coping with famine stresses. Fitness involves the question of whether food crises have any significant effect on the receptivity of local communities to new concepts and technologies, and the extent to which public food distri- bution programs destroy private charity and, by depressing local farm prices, harm cultivators whose land is still in production. Other important coping issues concern the possible polarization of social classes through dis- tress transfers of assets from poor to rich. The capacity of towns and cities to absorb sudden large influxes of famine refugees also implies problems of distribution. And, of course, the list can easily be extended. I suspect we already have theories in formal organizations, small group communica- tions, cognitive substrates of decision making, transactional networks, and underdevelopment that can give famine research a considerable boost by posing these questions as testable hypotheses.
