<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guide to the Year's Work General Materials DAVID G. RIEDE Once again this year many of the best new general studies of Victo- rian poetry and culture focus on the long neglected contributions of women writers and of women's perspectives. Women s Poetry, Late Romantic to Late Victorian: Gender and Genre, 1 830- J 900, edited by Isobel Armstrong and Virginia Blain, consists of eighteen essays collected mainly from the 1995 conference "Rethinking Women's Poetry 1730-1930" held at Birkbeck College. In addition to the editors, the impressive list of contributors includes Cheryl Walker, Yopie Prins, Linda Peterson, Meenakshi Mukherjee, Edward Marx, Tricia Lootens, Kathleen Hickok, and other prominent scholars, and covers a range of topics including the marketing of poetry by women, lesbian poetics, colonial poetics and national iden- tity, poetic uses of devotional, patriotic, and scientific discourses, and recovery of such forgotten or neglected poets as Adelaide Proctor, Emily Pfeiffer, Olive Custance, Laurence Hope, Margaret Veley, Tom Dutt, Sarojini Naidu, and the American poets Lydia Sigourney and Frances Harper as well as readings of such better known poets as Amy Levy, Michael Field, and Dora Greenwell and of the now firmly canonical Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Christina Rossetti. The highlights of the collec- tion, I think, are the essays by the editors, especially Armstrong's intro- ductory essay "Msrepresentation: Codes of Affect and Politics in Nine- teenth-Century Women's Poetry," which compellingly argues that the sen- timentality and lachrymose melancholy of much women's poetry is well worth recovery after having been purged by the "cruel policing of affect" that was part of a "Whig Aesthetic" and its "genealogy of nineteenth- century women's poetry as a progressive move toward modernism" (pp. 4- 5). Rather than leaving behind this body of poetry as the faltering first steps toward genuine literary accomplishment, Armstrong argues, we need to inquire into "the possibilities of that culture of affect, and the genres and linguistic forms it engendered, the possibility that 'slush' might pos- sess some epistemic potential" and might even enrich "the impoverished terms of our own century for feeling and emotion" (p. 3). Armstrong's project, and the project of the whole collection, is not only to recover a 413</page><page sequence="2">414 I VICTORIAN POETRY few neglected poets, but also to revalue a whole discredited cultural mode and an "ideology of feeling" (p. 3) that has had, and may still have, politi- cal power and value. The politics of the female culture of affect are ana- lyzed in Armstrong's essay and also, most obviously, in three essays (Mukherjee, Marx, Lootens) gathered under the common heading "Colo- nial Poetics, National Identity," and in the three gathered under the title "Lesbian Poetics." Heading this latter section, Virginia Blain's "Sexual Politics of the Victorian Closet" persuasively argues that the historical tendency to dismiss women's poetry as sentimental and masochistic ought to be reversed by viewing the poetry not as repellently sentimental but as intriguingly perverse. Defining lesbian poetry broadly as poetry authoriz- ing sexual autonomy, Blain establishes her case with intriguing discus- sions of Michael Field and Olive Custance, and especially with a superb reading of Margaret Veley's "A Japanese Fan." The other two essays in this section, on Michael Field by Robert Fletcher and on Amy Levy by Emma Francis, both sustain and complicate the argument about the in- triguing perversity of these very accomplished poets. Finally, the volume as a whole demonstrates how far recovery of Victorian women's poetry has come, both by its confident assumptions about the value of such poets as Levy, Field, Greenwell, Webster and others, and by its convincing dem- onstration of the value of the whole culture of affect informing the ac- complishments of Victorian women writers. With its friendly, un threatening title, The Cambridge Companion to Victorian Poetry, edited by Joseph Bristow, might be expected to provide a guide to received ideas about Victorian poetry for the general reader, but instead it promises "some of the most exciting critical developments in an area of inquiry that has undergone remarkable changes during the past 20 years" (p. xv). Rather than offering user- friendly, companionable, contextualizing chapters on the major works of the major canonical po- ets, the Companion challenges familiar "canon-bolstering assumptions" (p. xx) with thirteen essays adopting a range of modern approaches - drawn from sources as diverse as gender studies, materialist critique, poststructuralist thought, and cultural historicism - to analyze a much wider span of writers than proponents of the major canon were for de- cades willing to take seriously (p. xx). The excellent cast of contributors, including E. Warwick Slinn, Kathy Psomiades, Yopie Prins, Thais Mor- gan, Tricia Lootens, and John Lucas, ably fulfill these promises with dis- cussions of generic and formal innovation (Slinn, Cornelia Pearsall, and Prins), historicism (Hilary Fraser), science (Daniel Brown), religious di- versity (Cynthia Scheinberg), patriotism (Lootens), and gender (Susan Brown, Morgan). Representative of the strength of the volume is Lootens' essay on "Victorian poetry and patriotism," which incisively discusses the</page><page sequence="3">DAVID G.RIEDE 1415 familiar jingoism of Tennyson, Kipling, and Henley for the general reader, provides a nuanced reading of the poets for more advanced students, and offers an innovative approach by focusing on the female tradition from Hemans to Elizabeth Barrett Browning and by arguing that a protofeminist British woman could indeed write patriotic poems, but only "if she writes ofltaly"(p. 260). One of the most innovative studies of Victorian poetry and feminist literary history in recent years is Yopie Prins's extraordinarily erudite Victorian Sappho, a reception study, of sorts, that far transcends its apparent critical genre (see also Margot Louis' earlier review in VP 37, no. 3). As Prins establishes in her opening chapter, the proper name "Sappho" does not simply designate a historical person, but rather provides a locus for the construction of a voice or persona from the scattered fragments attributed to Sappho down the centuries, and the afterlife, or legend of Sappho passed down from Longinus, Ovid, and other sources. In virtuoso readings of the original Greek fragments and of their various English translations, Prins not only offers a powerful rereading of Sappho and important insights into the theory and practice of translation, but demonstrates as well that the modern idea of Sappho is "in many ways, an artifact of Victorian poetics" (p. 1), and consequently a product and reflection of Victorian ideology. Because "Sappho" is less a person than a persona or personification, the Victorian reception of the Sapphic fragments entails a personification engendering lyric poetry as the embodiment of female passion; the embodiment, via Longinus' Sappho, of the sublime; the personification, via Swinburne, of rhythm and meter and, most obviously, the personification of the "poetess" as embodied in Felicia Hemans, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, and a long line of Victorian successors. Prins's arguments are made, for the most part, by brilliant, intricate, often difficult deconstructive close readings that might occasionally blur the larger outlines of her argument but that productively complicate, problematize, and surpass traditional readings of the Victorian "poetess" and of the Victorian lyric generally. Among her many contributions to our understanding of Victorian poetry, Prins shows in chapters on Michael Field and on the tradition of the "poetess" that the usual idea of lyric poetry, in Mill's terms, as "feeling confessing itself to feeling, in moments of solitude" (p. 75), is profoundly complicated by the personification of lyric as a Sappho who is not a solitary author but a "composite image made up of many Sapphos, in a multiauthored text that allows signatures to multiply under her name" (p. 74)- As in the case of Michael Field, lyric utterance can be understood as collaborative, even as an interlacing of poetic fragments, but beyond this explicit collaboration, the literary history of lyric can be seen as an endless series of collaborations,</page><page sequence="4">416/ VICTORIAN POETRY as postscripts inscribed under many names but always also under the name of Sappho. As would be expected, the reception of Lesbian Sappho reveals much about the late Victorian production of lesbian poetics in Michael Field and others, but rather more surprisingly, Prins makes the convincing case that the perversity, or sado-masochism, of Swinburne is also informed by his reception of Sappho as expressed in "Anactoria," "On the Cliffs," "Sapphics," and Lesbia Brandon. Victorian Sappho makes an important contribution to Swinburne studies, showing how to Swinburne the Sapphic sublime "is a revelation of rhythm: in 'Anactoria' the Sapphic body is manifested rhythmically throughout the world, and in 'On the Cliffs' all time proves to be a manifestation of Sapphic rhythm as well" (p. 140). Further, as Prins convincingly argues, the deliberately outrageous perversity of Poems and Ballads and of Swinburne's flagellation fetish contributes fundamentally to his sophisticated aestheticism and his mastery of rhythm and meter, as the "biting" and "stinging" of Sapphic rhythm show "how closely his aesthetic and pornographic writings are linked to the formal question of meter" (p. 153). In addition to books recovering important female influences on Vic- torian culture, two of the age's most important books of "masculine" schol- arship, Chambers' Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation and the multi- authored Essays and Reviews, have been brought back into prominence this year with new editions and impressive discussions of the controver- sies they sparked. James A. Secord's new edition of the Vestiges insures the continued availability of a work that has never been long out of print and adds a valuable introduction stressing the significance to the controversy of the work's original anonymity. Of even greater importance, however, is Secord's splendid study of the history of the work's production and recep- tion, Victorian Sensation: The Extraordianry Publication, Reception, and Se- cret Authorship of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Secord's study not only clarifies the scientific and religious contexts of the Vestiges, but also constitutes an important and innovative contribution to studies of the history of book production and reception. Avoiding generalizations about the public sphere, Secord describes in exhaustively researched de- tail the material as well as intellectual conditions of the book's produc- tion and dissemination, and with admirable clarity sets out the circum- stances of the book's reception in many diverse but intersecting public spheres, the scientific and religious communities as they differed from city to city, class to class, and gender to gender. Until now one of the most important and influential books of the Victorian period, the 1860 Essays and Reviews, has not been even toler- ably accessible to modern readers, but fortunately a modern, scholarly edition of the work has been published, with all the requisite annotation</page><page sequence="5">DAVID G.RIEDE 1417 and apparatus to make the importance of the volume's theological dispu- tation evident. The editors of Essays and Reviews: The I860 Text and its Readings Victor Shea and William Whitla, detail not only the contribu- tors and the origin of the volume, but also provide a full account of the furor it caused, including heresy trials for two of the contributors, a kind of academic trial for another (Benjamin Jowett), a synodical condemna- tion of the volume, the concerted attack against another contributor, Frederick Temple, when he was made Bishop of Exeter ten years later, and even satires and cartoons spawned by the controversy. Without the ex- pert guidance of Shea and Whitla through the ecclesiastic, civil, and academic law, and the theological thickets, modern readers would find it difficult or impossible to fathom the causes of such uproar over a volume that, to paraphrase T S. Eliot, now seems more remarkable for the quality of its faith than for the quality of its doubt. But as the editors make clear, the furor was caused not by any remarkable theological innovations or attacks, but because the contributors were writing as prominent clerics and academics within the pale of the established church, and included a future Archbishop of Canterbury, Temple, the influential and widely re- spected Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford, Jowett, and other mainstays of the liberal, broad church party within the Church of England. Essays and Reviews would presumably have had little impact if it had originated on the margins of the established church, but coming from the center it reverberated throughout Victorian culture, shaking the high and low church factions as, in Pusey's terms, "the greatest crisis the Church of England has ever gone through" (p. 736), testing the limits of academic and legal tolerance of free speech, calling into question the relations of church and state, of science and religion, and, in Matthew Arnold's terms, of litera- ture and dogma, and even generating concerns about the governance of empire, as a reactionary clergy worried that missionaries, misled by her- esy, might be corrupting rather than converting the lower races. And closer to home, some worried that parents would no longer be able to send their sons to Oxford, the center of the controversy, for fear of the "incalculable extent to which Oxford may become a destroyer of souls" (p. 784)- About four inches thick and over 1000 pages long Essays and Re- views: The 1860 Text and its Reading is a formidable book, but, thanks to the Herculean labor of its editors, it is an invaluable, even necessary book for the understanding of the mid Victorian church and Victorian culture generally. Judged by its cover, a much more immediately inviting book is Linda Nead's Victorian Babylon: People, Streets and Images in Nineteenth-Century London, but in addition to its attractions as a coffee-table book, Nead's volume offers a thesis representing Victorian London as a rival to Paris as</page><page sequence="6">418 / VICTORIAN POETRY the capital city of modernism. The term "Victorian Babylon" ineluctably summons the lurid slant of the Pall Mall Gazette's "Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon," and Nead does indeed discuss the sensational and sensual spaces emergent in the modern city, but she also notes that the Victorians "drew upon the image of the ancient city to invoke the wealth, splendor and refinement of the modern metropolis" (p. 3). Focusing on the discourses of modernism represented by London, Nead argues, shifts the account of modernism from the autocratic and abrupt transformation of Haussman's Paris to a more democratic, "equivocal and piecemeal" (p. 6) engagement with the new. Still, despite shifting the focus from Benjamin's version of Paris as capital of the nineteenth-century, Nead invokes Benjamin's "archeology of modernity, in which the sites of the modern city stand on layer upon layer of an underground city, which maintains a hellish and ghostlike presence within modernity" (p. 6). This sense of a haunted modernity is richly suggestive of Freud's evocation of the ghostly ruins of Rome in Civilization and Its Discontents, and Nead approaches a kind of phenomenological version of modernity by way of Michel de Certeau and the opposition between a distanced, abstracting or cartographical vision of the city and a more complicated vision at street level where "space cannot be controlled in a single gaze, but is apprehended through a rhetoric of walking and its associated symbolic mechanisms of dreams, memories, and fables" (p. 7). For the most part, however, Nead does not explore the implications and resonance of this "poetics of space" (p. 7) so much as she uses de Certeau's and Benjamin's insights as a framing device for discussion of the ways in which Victorian London was redesigned and reworked piecemeal to provide improved circulation of air, light (gas), water, and people. The layers underneath the modern city, in fact, become not the ghosts of its past, but the modern circulation systems themselves, the sewers and underground transportation lines. Nead very effectively tells the story of how these innovations displaced the older city, and her well- chosen illustrations from the contemporary illustrated press invoke the sense in which the new is built on the ruins of the old. Shifting from a "poetics of space" to a "poetics of gas," Nead also discusses modernity in terms of the gaslit nights of the most illuminated of nineteenth-century cities. And finally, by a natural transition from the gaslit city and especially, the shadowy moral terrain of the Cremorne Pleasure Gardens, she discusses the emergence in the modern city of obscenity in the promiscuous circulation of diverse classes and sexes in public spaces, and the equally insalubrious blockage of public arteries not only by the festering constriction of Holywell Street but even by such a monument as Temple Bar, the last remnant of the old city's local divisions, a symbolically ambivalent gateway/barrier that impeded the circulation defining the</page><page sequence="7">DAVID G.RIEDE 1419 democratic modern metropolis. A somewhat different perspective on the building of urban space and design of urban circulation is just one of the topics taken up by Karen Chase and Michael Levenson in their fascinating The Spectacle of Intimacy: A Public Life for the Victorian Family. As they argue, the construction of arteries for salutary circulation was consistent with the building of barri- ers around the middle-class family, and so with the segregation of the domestic middle classes from Mayhew's "nomad" class, the homeless ur- ban poor. The building of New Oxford Street, for example, undoubtedly improved circulation in the city, but did so by cutting right through the densely populated rookery of St. Giles, simultaneously eradicating the shelters of the poor, sheltering the middle classes from the poor, and exposing the previously hidden lives of the lowest classes to surveillance. As the title suggests, The Spectacle of Intimacy is concerned with the trium- phant hegemony of middle-class domestic ideology in the Victorian pe- riod, and especially with events and circumstances that occasionally made the private realm of domestic intimacy spectacularly public and exposed fault lines in the Victorian family. The study begins with a consideration of the difficulty encountered by the 1851 census in even defining the family as a social unit (does a family exist without a male head of the household? are servants part of the family?) and proceeds to examine the public exposure of Caroline Norton's divorce and struggle for custody of her children and of the extraordinary bedchamber crisis that brought even the young Queen Victoria's domestic life onto the public stage so spectacularly as to cause a parliamentary crisis and change in government. Later chapters revise the traditional readings of Sarah Stickney Ellis' in- fluential displays of domestic roles for women and Dickens' formative representation of domestic bliss and proceed to compelling analyses of such public exfoliations of domestic ideology as the endlessly debated Deceased Wife's Sister Act, and of illuminatingly concurrent parliamen- tary debates about the mutiny of Indian sepoys and the mutiny of English wives possibly behind the divorce act of 1857. Finally, this engaging and shrewd study, extending from 1835 to the 1860s, arrives at the point where Victorians became self-conscious about the dominance of domestic ideology, and began to gain enough ironic distance from it to view its everyday workings as an ongoing spectacle. Looking at spectacular, mostly isolated instances, The Spectacle of Intimacy does not, of course, explore all of the nooks and crannies of the private, intimate places of Victorian life, but does very effectively explore fault lines that appear whenever that private intimacy is forced into public view. The Spectacle of Intimacy examines Victorian domesticity up to about 1870, but as Talia Schaffer shows in The Forgotten Female Aesthetes: Literary</page><page sequence="8">420 I VICTORIAN POETRY Culture and Late Victorian England, the spectacle becomes increasingly complicated by changing gender roles and expectations toward the close of the century. In one of her most intriguing chapters, for example, Schaffer points out the cultural production of male aesthetic experts and professionals even in the previous female spheres of home decoration and fashion, and of course once the male aesthete appropriates the female realm for art, it is available for public exhibition and the ideological fissures show all the more prominently. Shaffer's interest, however, is not in the domestic ideology per se, but rather in the gendering of aesthetic roles, and her argument about male aesthetes in the domestic sphere suggests a feminization of the aesthetic sphere in the late nineteenth century. This, in turn, created opportunities for women to reappropriate the feminine realm and simultaneously claim traditionally male roles of aesthetic expertise. Schaffer's ambitious larger project is to shift discussion of aestheticism from its limited focus on the male aesthetes and decadence of the Yellow Book and the "tragic generation" to a "Woman's World of British Aestheticism" represented primarily by Wilde's editing of the magazine Woman s World "as a kind of aesthetic manifesto" in which "Aestheticism becomes a movement centered on women, designed for a female readership, passionately concerned with women's political and literary choices" (p. 2). Schaffer's redefinition of aestheticism as a popular culture, "based in material culture, and interested in alternative gender behaviors" may at times seem to stretch the term too far beyond what Pater or even Wilde apparently meant by it, as when she expands aestheticism's "Love of Beauty" to include "love of children and nature" (p. 4), but her radical shift in perspective does offer a new, greatly revised literary history for the later nineteenth century. Schaffer's methodological dilemma, however, is that her representa- tion of this new history goes far beyond recovery of one or two forgotten women writers, who could be discussed at length, and necessitates an overview of the period that takes account of so many forgotten or ne- glected women that she can only describe many in fairly cursory terms, trusting that the fundamentally female genesis of aestheticism will emerge from brief accounts of the works of Rosamund Marriot Watson, "George Fleming" (Constance Fletcher), Elizabeth Robbins Pennell, Violet Hunt, Netta Syrett, Ella Hepworth Dixon, Ella D'Arcy, Una Ashworth Taylor, Jane and Mary Findlater, Rhoda and Agnes Garrett, Florence Farr, Vernon Lee, Ellen Thorny croft Tyler and many others. Such an approach does radically reshape our understanding of a literary epoch that has tradition- ally been seen as relatively lacking in women writers, but offers little opportunity for the kind of analysis that would lead to the recovery of specific authors. Realizing this, however, Schaffer devotes three chapters</page><page sequence="9">DAVID G.R1EDE 1421 to writers who were particularly influential in the Victorian period, and also helped shape the Aesthetic movement and the Modernist movement that followed- The chapter on Ouida reminds us of her enormous popu- larity in her own age and also affirms that her development of aestheticist themes and techniques influenced the better remembered male aesthetes of the succeeding generation. Extracting the dandyism and occasional epigrams from Ouida's potboiling novels of falsetto masculinity, of hard fighting, hard riding aristocrats, Schaffer argues that Ouida's bestsellers were the founding documents of the aesthetic novel from Meredith and Wilde to Henry James: "Rereading Ouida's work reveals that the aesthetic novel largely derives from - of all places - popular women's writing- Much of the later history of aesthetic fiction can be read as an attempt to cover, contest, or accommodate this supposedly shameful origin" (p. 124)- As Schaffer shows, Ouida did influence Wilde and James, and she does de- serve a place in the history of aestheticism, but rereading her work actu- ally shows how Schaffer's selective quotations exaggerate the aestheticism of the novels and the resemblances between Ouida's works and those of her successors. Another chapter of The Forgotten Female Aesthetes seeks to recover Alice Meynell, who was never really quite lost. Meynell serves very well, however, as an example of how aestheticism attempting to take the form of heightened femininity could suffer the fate of being dismissed as only an exaggerated version of the angel in the house. From this perspective, however, Schaffer is able to show that Meynell had a far more profound effect upon Virginia Woolf and modernism than seems allowed for by Woolf 's simple assassination of the Angel. Since Meynell is the only poet treated at length in The Forgotten Female Aesthetes, it seems rather a shame that Schaffer chooses to focus on her essays rather than her poetry, though she has provided a perceptive account from the essays of her primary aesthetic concerns. The third figure treated at length - and evidently Schaffer's favorite - is Lucas Malet (Mary St. Leger Kingsley Harrison), a figure much more obscured than the others by her Modernist successors. The accounts of Malet's novels, especially The Wages of Sin and The History of Sir Richard Calmady, again make Schaffer's case by way of selective and somewhat misleading quotations, but they do make it clear that Malet deserves a more prominent place in literary history, though Schaffer's advocacy at times seems slightly strident, as when she accuses Hardy of plagiarizing Malet and hiding his source so well that "usual literary his- tory," canonizing Hardy and neglecting Malet, "may not only be factually wrong but may perpetrate a monumental injustice, perhaps indeed a liter- ary crime" (p. 241). Nevertheless, Schaffer convincingly argues that the traditional literary history of aestheticism needs to be reexamined, and</page><page sequence="10">422 I VICTORIAN POETRY that such a reassessment may indeed move Ouida, Meynell, Malet, and others into greater prominence, and lead to a regendering of aestheticism and the origins of modernism. Specialized Materials DONALD E. HALL On the occasion of the recent publication of the hefty Norton An- thology of Theory and Criticism, I will review in the coming pages two of the Norton's main competitors (Richter's The Critical Tradition and Rivkin and Ryan's Literary Theory: An Anthology) before turning my attention to Norton's entry into the critical theory textbook field, discussing briefly the strengths and weaknesses of all three. But given the fact that these anthologies serve only as core texts in a critical theory class, and in my opinion need substantial supplementation, I will also suggest some possi- bilities for your consideration, among them some of the newest entries in Routledge's "New Critical Idiom" series, which I reviewed in this column two years ago. The second edition of David H. Richter's The Critical Tradition: Classic Texts and Contemporary Trends (Bedford/St. Martin's, 1998) is a popular and widely used core anthology in critical-theory classes across the na- tion. It is certainly easy to see why this is the case. Divided into two parts (following the organization suggested by its subtitle) this textbook is especially good for classes that must by design or professorial inclination cover the entire history of criticism and theory from Plato to the present. Its "Classic Texts" section contains fifty-eight entries by forty-four critics, including (as one might expect) Plato, Aristotle, Horace, Sidney, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and T S. Eliot. Its "Contemporary Trends" sec- tion contains sixty-two selections by approximately the same number of critics. This section is subdivided into the following genres of contempo- rary theory: "Formalisms," "Structuralism, Semiotics, and Deconstruction," "Reader-Response Criticism," "Psychoanalytic Theory," "Marxist Criticism," "New Historicism and Cultural Studies," "Feminist Literary Criticism," "Gender Studies and Queer Theory," and "Multiculturalism and the Canon Wars." Each section is introduced capably with an overview of the meth- odology or genre of analysis being covered and all selections are well foot- noted. Yet given the span of the textbook, anthologizing as it does the work of two and a half millennia in its approximately 1600 pages, some of its coverage is inevitably thin, especially in its latter sections. Postcolonial theory is not separated out as a distinct critical field; instead it receives</page><page sequence="11">DONALD E. HALL 1 423 sketchy attention in "New Historicism and Cultural Studies" and "Multiculturalism." Gayatri Spivak, one of the most important and influ- ential feminist postcolonial critics, is nowhere to be found. Furthermore, since there is room only for six selections covering the broad and complex field of "Feminism," it is hardly surprising but certainly distressing that there are no articulations from lesbian feminists that would demonstrate their important relationship to the larger field (works by Audre Lorde, Bonnie Zimmerman, and/or Adrienne Rich would have been obvious choices). And finally post-structuralism does not get sufficient attention as fundamental to most other contemporary theoretical perspectives and as a field demanding clear distinction from structuralism and semiotics. Indeed, the fact that post-structuralism is reduced simply to "deconstruction" is highly problematic. Some of these problems are resolved in Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan's Literary Theory: An Anthology (Blackwell, 1998), though others are immediately apparent that Richter's text did not evince. Rivkin and Ryan's strengths are several. As a text that focuses solely on the twenti- eth century, its coverage of contemporary theoretical perspectives is much deeper than Richter's. In its approximately 1100 pages, we find almost double the number of entries under roughly the same number of sub- headings that we find in Richter's last section. Thus Rivkin and Ryan's coverage of "Post-Structuralism, Deconstruction, and Post-Modernism" is much more representative of the wealth and diversity of material in that broad field, including several selections by Derrida and Foucault, and others by Baudrillard, Lyotard, and Deleuze and Guattari; the section even includes selections by Nietzsche and Heidegger that demonstrate the philosophical history behind post-structuralist interrogations of natu- ralized meanings and binary constructs. Similarly, Rivkin and Ryan's "Femi- nism" section offers twelve selections that sample amply both Anglo- American and French feminist theory. Though somewhat uneven in quality and length, Rivkin and Ryan's introductions to the various genres or categories of theory are often better than Richter's. Particularly good are their overviews of "Psychoanalysis" and "Feminism." Less successful (because brief and very incomplete) are their introductions to "Gender Studies, Gay/Lesbian Studies, Queer Theory," and "Cultural Studies." But the biggest problem with Rivkin and Ryan's text is that it is not footnoted. While Richter with considerable care will explain jargon and unfamiliar historical references for the benefit of beginning students, Rivkin and Ryan provide neither footnotes nor a glossary. Granted, the process of doing one or both would have added considerably to the time that it took to produce the Blackwell volume (and, no doubt, cut into immediate</page><page sequence="12">424 I VICTORIAN POETRY profits because of the delay in releasing it), but the short-term gain in the rush to publish is inevitably a long-term loss in terms of student/teacher satisfaction and loyalty. Indeed, I have used Rivkin and Ryan several times now and still find it so problematic because of that lack of notes (and also its very thin coverage of post-coloniality, as was the case with Richter) that every semester I look for a text with which to replace it- Needless to say, I eagerly awaited the publication of the new Norton An- thobgy. But frankly, I am still unsure about whether or not I will switch books- The strengths of the Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism (ed. Leitch, Cain, et al) are several- At well over 2500 pages it is the longest of the three volumes reviewed here, with selections that range back to the Greek era but that are heavily weighted toward the twentieth century. It is quite telling that with all entries arranged chronologically by date of birth of the writer, Freud's entries begin on page 913; thus this volume contains even deeper coverage of the twentieth century than Rivkin and Ryan. Furthermore it is superbly footnoted, just as all of the Norton an- thologies of British and American literature are. Students and general readers will not lose valuable time by running to theory dictionaries, gen- eral encyclopedias, and other reference works for explanations of unclear terms and oblique references. However, the basic organizational principle above does detract from its immediate utility in a class that organizes itself thematically or by genre of analysis. The twenty-nine-page introduction to the entire vol- ume does cover very briefly some of the characteristics of psychoanalytic analysis, post-structuralist theory, etc., and the author headnotes provide more useful information, but this anthology's basic methodological ex- planatory matter is still very thin. While user-friendly for readers looking at individual author entries, it is very unfriendly for any needing help in understanding what "cultural studies" is or what varieties of analysis can be called "feminist," and expecting to acquire a firm grasp on the conflicts and convergences within such broad fields (indeed, "feminism" and "queer theory" are discussed together in a ridiculously scant two pages of the volume's introduction). Norton's in-house style, which mandates chro- nological ordering by birthdate, wholly obscures the fact that affiliations and methodological influences are actually far more important for student understanding than whether an individual writer was born in 1931 or 1941- Contemporary work in historiography has rendered thoroughly suspicious any ascription of firm "meaning" to such linear timelines. Indeed, Norton, the publishing house, needs to read and think about some of the "theory" that it is now packaging and selling for a profit. But much remains to praise, and I wish to reiterate that fact. I could</page><page sequence="13">DONALD E. HALL 1 425 quibble at length with individual selections (in particular, I think the editors chose generally unhelpful and somewhat idiosyncratic works by Judith Butler and were wrong to wholly ignore Luce Irigaray) but cer- tainly the inclusion of intriguing selections by Gerald Graff, Jane Tompkins, Bonnie Zimmerman, and bell hooks are commendable. Furthermore, the volume's bibliographies are superb, covering other anthologies, glossaries, and overviews of modern and contemporary schools and movements. As with all Norton volumes, the indexing here is also very thorough- But one cannot use a book such as the new Norton without long and detailed lectures or assigning another work of general introduction to the various theories and methodologies. Since I have published such a work in the past year and will not, of course, review my own book, I will simply mention that it (Literary and Cultural Theory: From Basic Principles to Advanced Applications, Houghton Mifflin) and similar books by Steven Lynn (Texts and Contexts, Harper Collins), M. Keith Booker (A Practical Introduction to Literary Theory and Criticism, Longman), and Peter Barry (Beginning Theory, Manchester Univ. Press) might serve your purposes, depending upon your needs and critical interests and emphases. And, of course, there are several other ways of successfully covering important theoretical terms and topics through supplemental text selec- tion. The St. Martin's casebook series of primary literary works and appli- cations of various methods/theoretical frames for understanding those works is a popular avenue for theory teachers. And as I discussed two years ago in this column, the Routledge "New Critical Idiom" series offers some excellent overviews of significant terms and topics in contemporary theory. I will take the remaining space of this review to discuss some of the most successful of the recent titles in this strong, ongoing series. As the preface to all volumes by the series editor, John Drakakis, promises, these texts, at their best, "provide clear, well- illustrated accounts of the full range of terminology currently in use, and . . . evolve histories of its changing usage." One of the strongest of the recent additions to the series is Parody, by Simon Dentith, published in 2000. As Dentith points out in his author's preface, parody has become a key concern of theorists and critics referencing Mikhail Bakhtin, who have "placed parody, and the parodying forms more generally, at the heart of discussions about the history of writing, in the theatre and poetry as much as in the novel" (p. ix), as well as those interested in controversies "about the nature of postmodernism [which have] turned on the place of parody in ... architecture and literary writing, and in popular culture as well" (p. ix). Dentith opens his first chapter with a close reading of the scene from Eliot's Middlemarch in which an effigy of Mr. Brooke is used to mock his words and undermine his</page><page sequence="14">426 / VICTORIAN POETRY candidacy for a parliamentary seat. Indeed, throughout the text, Dentith returns often to the Victorian era in ways that the readership of this journal will find useful in class. Among the writers who receive at least passing consideration are Dickens, Carlyle, Carroll, and Robert Brown- ing. Another Victorian author who figures quite prominently is William Thackeray, whose Vanity Fair - "A Novel without a Hero" - reveals the ways in which parody "in discrediting those genres which aspire to the 'heroic' can be seen as part of the wider generic history of the novel, the form which, above all others, is addressed to 'common life' in all its unhe- roic ordinariness" (pp. 69-70). Dentith also provides a very detailed dis- cussion of parody's role in the development of poetry, which will, no doubt, interest many of Victorian Poetry's readers. And even more to the point of the present review, the topic of "parody" allows Dentith to engage a wide range of recent theorists and critical stances. In his opening chapter he details approaches to "parody" that survey theorists as diverse as Gerard Genette and Linda Hutcheon, with references to Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, and many others. In his last chapter on "Parody and the Postmodern," he returns to theoreti- cal musings with examinations of Fredric Jameson, Salman Rushdie, and Richard Poirier. The only major theorist of parody wholly absent from his discussion is Judith Butler, whose oft-cited book Gender Trouble (1991) ends with one of the most important recent statements on the topic, entitled "From Parody to Politics." But certainly Dentith's is a book that will be useful in a wide variety of theory and applied literary criticism courses. Similarly engaged with a wide variety of authors and theorists is Peter Childs's Modernism, also from 2000. In attempting to answer the question "What is modernism?" Childs moves gracefully from consider- ations of Adorno, to Barthes, to Habermas, to Showalter, to Wittgenstein. But his most sustained analysis is reserved for six theorists whom he considers central to the conceptualization and cultural solidification of modernism: Marx, Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Saussure, and Einstein, each of whom receive five to ten pages of careful consideration. While his discussion of modernism and poetry centers primarily on works by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, throughout the text Childs returns often to Victorian texts, controversies, concerns, and social changes. Indeed, Childs's is a standout text for its solid base in historical evidence, exam- ining everything from urbanization during the nineteenth century to the discovery of X-rays. This is a book appropriate for classes surveying late Victorian and twentieth century literature, as well as theory seminars focusing on historicist and materialist approaches to the interpretation of literature and culture.</page><page sequence="15">DONALD E. HALL 1 427 Also among the very best of the recent volumes, for its coverage and intellectual depth, is Graham Allen's Intertextuality (2000)- Working in sophisticated fashion across clearly explained theories by Saussure, Bahkhtin, Kristeva, Barthes, and many others, this is an excellent excur- sion into the many forms of intertextual analysis and ways of applying that analysis to texts by writers including the Brownings, Dickens, Conrad and others of interest to readers of this review. Allen so convincingly places questions of intertextual reference and origination at the heart of contemporary critical theory that this book could serve well as a key cen- tral text in any critical theory course or Victorian studies class- It is well- written, accessible to undergraduate and graduate students alike, and very well researched. As in many of the other volumes in the series, its "Glos- sary" of terms is helpful and lucid. I recommend it highly. Two other recent volumes, David Glover and Cora Kaplan's Genders (2000) and Gary Day's Class (2001) also offer helpful theory-based intro- ductions to their chosen topics. Both would serve well as overviews for students needing basic information or as core texts for seminars on femi- nist or Marxist/materialist analysis. Both texts explain and interrogate thoroughly nineteenth-century belief systems as well as recent critical moves. They follow and duplicate the successes of the many volumes covered here two years ago for which I reserved the highest praise and which would serve well as supplements to the theory anthologies reviewed above; these include David Hawkes's Ideology ( 1996), Joseph Bristow's Sexu- ality (1997), Tony Davies' Humanism (1997), Ania Loomba's Colonialism/ Postcolonialism (1998), and Peter Widdowson's Literature (1999). All are at once reliable and engaging. Thus there is a remarkable array of textbooks and supplemental material out there for instructors interested in incorporating theory into their classes or in covering a wide range of methodologies in introductory theory classes. As I suggest in my own textbook mentioned earlier, the study of literature has changed dramatically in the past few years. Today, students are not only expected to read and under- stand the novels, plays, and poems assigned in class; they are also expected to reflect on how their understanding is shaped by pre- suppositions and affected by cultural forces. . . . Indeed, at all levels, students are increasingly expected to write essays and term papers whose analysis has a clear theoretical base. (p. ix) Needless to say, I welcome these changes. And I wholeheartedly com- mend the contributions made by all of the critics, theorists, editors, and anthologists mentioned in the preceding pages. As is no doubt palpable</page><page sequence="16">428 / VICTORIAN POETRY throughout this review, I find this a very exciting time to be working in the field of literary analysis. Matthew Arnold CLINTON MACHANN The most significant publication in the field of Arnold scholarship for the year 2000 was the fourth volume of Cecil Y. Lang's Letters of Mat- thew Arnold (Univ. Press of Virginia, 1996-). As I begin to write this essay, I see that volume five, the penultimate one, has just been published, as well, so the end of Lang's massive project is in sight. The fifth volume will be covered in next year's essay, of course, but I will defer a discussion of the edition as a whole - including a return to some of the more contro- versial issues involving Lang's editorial practices that I touched upon in my comments about the first three volumes - until the sixth and final volume has made its appearance. Volume four covers the years 1871-78, a period during which Arnold wrote and published his most important religious criticism, while his repu- tation as a poet - based primarily on poems he had written much earlier in his life - continued to grow. In February of 1871 he published Friendship's Garland, a collection of letters written and published in The Pall Mall Gazette over the previous five years and featuring the fictional German character Arminius; the book contains the most outrageous and funniest satire that Arnold ever wrote. At the same time, Arnold was reflecting on the response to his book St. Paul and Protestantism (May 1870) and discovering that he had more to say about the Bible and Bible-reading. At first Arnold conceived the idea of writing a pair of essays on "literature as it regards dogma" as part of a larger project which included essays on literature and science, but, instead, the essays on dogma grew into a new book with his old publisher George Smith: Literature and Dogma: An Es- say Towards a Better Appreciation of the Bible (February 1873). Reaching a wider audience than any of his other books, Arnold's last substantial, original book of any kind was a "best seller" in an age of religious contro- versy. Literature and Dogma reached a fourth edition within a year, and in small editions it eventually sold as many as 100,000 copies. It was the first of Arnold's books to be translated, appearing as La Crise Rtligieuse in France (1876). Coverage by the periodical press - in England, America, and Europe - was correspondingly substantial, the most extensive that Arnold had ever received. The book's success may be partially attributed to the fact that it was Arnold's only major prose work composed primarily</page><page sequence="17">CLINTON MACHANN / 429 as a book manuscript rather than a series of articles. Although it did not make him a wealthy man, it brought him his greatest fame among his contemporaries. And as one might have expected, it made him an even more controversial figure than before, because in Literature and Dogma Arnold attempts to rescue Christianity from anthropomorphism and other vulgar errors of popular theology. Following Spinoza, he assumes that miracles must be discounted. The language of the Bible is the poetry of old Israel, "thrown out" to express experience that otherwise could not be expressed. Arnold uses the German term Aberglaube, "extra belief," to describe much Biblical language. Acknowledging the possibility that fu- ture Biblical critics may find him wrong, Arnold asks his readers to accept only what can be demonstrated to be valid in a modern, skeptical age. For Arnold, the greatest human achievements have been derived from an attempt to know an unknowable ultimate reality. Always speaking as a literary and cultural critic rather than a theologian, Arnold does not attempt a precise or fixed definition of religion, but he does describe it as "morality touched by emotion," Because Literature and Dogma was so successful despite the con- troversy it generated, Arnold had high expectations for its sequel, God and the Bible (November 1875). Of the two thousand copies printed, five hundred were sold to Macmillan for publication in New York. At first sales were brisk, but they faded as the months passed, and there was no second printing. An inexpensive "popular edition," like that of Literature and Dogma, was issued in 1884- As a "review of objections" to the earlier book, God and the Bible was naturally seen as somewhat derivative of and less significant than its predecessor. Nevertheless, the second book ex- tends Arnold's range as a literary critic, especially in its investigation of John, and Arnold believed that it contained some of his best prose. The articles which made up God and the Bible received a fair amount of critical attention, but typical objections to both the arguments made by Arnold and his style had become familiar. The book itself, unlike its predecessor, did not stir a great deal of interest. At any rate, God and the Bible was Arnold's last unified book-length project of any kind, although his pro- duction of critical essays continued unabated. The miscellaneous Last Essays on Church and Religion came out in March of 1877, as he was turning his attention to more literary topics. It happens that one of the Last Essays, "A Last Word on the Burials Bill," is discussed in a recent article by Terry G. Harris, who argues that Arnold's focus on the English Church's "influ- ence on a social context emphasizing righteous conduct" serves to remove "the possibility of the church's being a means to increased spiritual in- sight" ("Burying the Dead: Matthew Arnold and the Dissenters" [VN 98:26- 29]).</page><page sequence="18">430 / VICTORIAN POETRY Although Arnold's last two books on religion had not sold well, his reputation, shaped by the unusual path of his literary career, remained substantial. One measure of public recognition is the increasing number of parodies of Arnold published during the 1870s, from jokes in Punch to the character "Mr. Luke" in W. H. Mallock's satirical novel of 1877 en- titled New Republic. But it was not only as a prose controversialist that Arnold was being talked about. His first collected edition of Poems (1869) had helped to solidify his reputation as an enduring poet, and, as he ended his "religious" phase, he was ready to publish a new edition of Poems (1877) and his first edition of Selected Poems (1878). It was ironic that Arnold, actively engaged as a critic, watched the sales of his books of collected essays decline after the success of Literature and Dogma in 1873, while the collected poems he had written in the first phase of his literary life were selling better than ever. The Selected volume, published in the new "Golden Treasury" series by Macmillan, originally priced at 4s. 6d., remained in print into the third decade of the twentieth century. Among the major events in Arnold's personal life during the years 1871-78 was the death of his son Trevenen William in February 1872, at the age of eighteen. (In 1868, Arnold had lost two sons: the infant Basil and the sixteen-year-old Thomas.) After a leave from his duties as inspec- tor of schools allowed Arnold and his wife to spend a long holiday in Italy (February-May, 1873), they moved to Pains Hill Cottage, Cobham, Sur- rey, where Arnold lived until his death. Arnold's mother died at Fox How, the old family home, in September 1873. All of these things are discussed in Arnold's letters from this period, and, as in earlier years, many of his most revealing comments - not only concerning details of his personal life but his intellectual development as well - are found in letters to family members: his mother, his sister Frances or "Fan" (especially after their mother's death), and his brother Tom (a Catholic who had a particularly conflicted religious history). The last surviving letter to his mother (March 30, 1873) is a long account of his travels in Italy that he mailed in April 1873 from Rome, where his En- glish tourist's reflections are made more poignant by associations with his famous father, Thomas Arnold, whose best-known publication was his History of Rome. His mother's death marks an important transitional time in Arnold's intellectual as well as emotional life. He was particularly sensitive to his mother's attitude toward his foray into religious criticism, and shortly after her death (October 11, 1873), he wrote of her to his friend Lady de Rothschild: "She had a clearness and fairness of mind, an interest in things, and a power of appreciating what might not be in her own line, which were very remarkable, and which remained with her to the very end of her life." Then he refers to a letter she had written to him</page><page sequence="19">CLINTON MACHANN / 43 1 upon the publication of Literature and Dogma: "It was a wonderful letter; I can think of no woman in the prime of life, brought up and surrounded as my mother was [and] with my mother's sincere personal convictions, who could have written it; and in a woman past 80 it was something astonish- ing/' It seems that Arnold felt he had been carrying forward the mother, and through her, the legacy of the father, toward new formulations of thought and belief At the deepest level, Arnold's mother profoundly influenced every aspect of his literary career, not primarily because she exercised a psychological power over him in their personal relationship, but rather because Arnold internalized a certain version of his mother which was central to his intellectual as well as emotional life. The tradi- tions of Fox How functioned in Arnold's private mythology much as Chris- tianity did in his vision of culture. One did not forsake one's institutions but rather accommodated them to historical development. And this re- minds me of one of my favorite lines from Arnold's correspondence: "Not to break one's connexion with the past in one's religion is one of the strongest instincts in human nature" (from a letter to his sister Fan, prob- ably June 21, 1876). However, just to illustrate the complexity of Arnold's emotional and intellectual make-up, let me point out that among the most interest- ing and significant letters from this period addressed to persons other than family relations are those to John Henry Newman, his (Broad Church) father's old adversary. There is evidence that Newman was in fact on Arnold's mind as he concentrated his literary efforts on religious subjects. When he published A Bible-Reading for Schools in May 1872, he sent a copy to Newman, and Newman responded with a friendly letter. The thin volume, published by Macmillan, contained Arnold's arrangement and edition of Isaiah, chapters 40-60, intended for "Young Learners." Arnold of course held strong opinions about the value of literature in children's education - in the preface he expresses his "conviction for the immense importance in education of what is called letters" - and this project dem- onstrates his practical commitment to the concept of "the Bible as litera- ture." Not surprisingly, Newman - like reviewers of the book - had reser- vations about using a Biblical text in this way, but he was polite in his response and commented on Arnold's editorial apparatus. Arnold in turn wrote to thank him for his comments and included some telling remarks about his own development as a writer: There are four people, in especial, from whom I am conscious of having learnt - a very different thing from merely receiving a strong impression - learnt habits, methods, ruling ideas, which are con- stantly with me; and the four are - Goethe, Wordsworth, Sainte</page><page sequence="20">432 / VICTORIAN POETRY Beuve and yourself You will smile and say I have made an odd mixture and the result must be a jumble: however that may be as to the whole, I am sure in details you must recognize your own influence often. (May 28, 1872) Arnold knew that Newman himself - like many of Newman's friends and adversaries alike - might well be puzzled by such a claim from a man ap- parently so far removed from Newman's deepest beliefs and commitments, but Arnold's habit of looking past conventional ideological categories was deeply ingrained and integral to his critical thought. All this helps us to understand that Arnold's much-contested concept of "disinterestedness" was considerably more than a mere rhetorical device or attempt to con- ceal hidden ideological agendas. In fact one important measure of a critic's sympathy toward Arnold is his or her opinions about Arnoldian disinterestedness. In the introduc- tion to his new edition of Modernism and the Critical Spirit (Transaction Publishers, originally published in 1978), Eugene Goodheart reasserts his belief in humanist criticism like Arnold's and refers to the Victorian's "balance, discrimination, and generosity," while Linda Ray Pratt, in her new Twayne book entitled Matthew Arnold Revisited, makes at least a ten- tative case for Arnold's continued relevance today: "Sweetness and light have dimmed in our politicized world, but the need for a disinterested criticism is greater than ever. . . . The inescapable cultural construction of values makes a genuinely disinterested criticism beyond full realization, but an increasingly diverse culture of competing claims and opposing val- ues makes it an ever more desirable way of trying to think." Of course a book of this kind is intended primarily as a general study of Arnold, especially for introducing him to new readers and students - not a theo- retical or polemical work - but, beginning with its title, this text empha- sizes the uncertain and controversial status of Arnold today. (At least some readers will remember Fraser Neiman's 1968 Matthew Arnold, no. 69 in Twayne 's English Authors Series and for many years a familiar and useful survey of Arnold's works; I expected to but didn't find some sort of prefatory reference to Neiman's book in Pratt's, no. 560 in the same se- ries.) At any rate, Pratt only hints at the intensity of the pounding that Arnold - as the supposed representative of elitist values or bourgeois val- ues or patriarchal values - has taken from critics on the academic Left in the past three decades or so. A recent, relatively sympathetic essay on Arnold in TLS by Terry Eagleton (who has done his share of pounding in the past) was answered by Nicholas Murray, author of a 1996 biography of Arnold, in a January 28 letter to TLS: Eagleton's essay was "a step in the right direction for 'the modern Left,' as it begins to come to terms with its</page><page sequence="21">CLINTON MACHANN / 433 old bugbear. (The climbdown must be slow. Face must be saved.) But we still get the sturdy caricature of Arnold the supercilious toff who feared the masses." Since Arnold's religious prose is being emphasized in the present essay, I should mention that although she slights some of Arnold's prose (Friendship's Garland is not even listed in her index) Pratt takes the reli- gious writings seriously, and she understands how his religious and Bibli- cal criticism grew directly out of his writings about culture. However, Pratt's work on Arnold over the past three decades and more has focused on the poetry rather than the prose, and her discussions in the book draw heavily on her 1969 and 1988 VP articles on "Empedocles on Etna" and a 1988 essay on "Tristram and Iseult." If one takes a look at Laura Cooner Lamdin and Robert Thomas Lamdin's new book Camelot in the Nineteenth Century : Arthurian Characters in the Poems of Tennyson, Arnold, Morris, and Swinburne (Greenwood Press) one is reminded of Arnold's innovative handling of the Tristram and Iseult legend, the first retelling of the story in nearly 400 years, with its distinctive narrator and narrative technique, its critique of passionate love, its unexpected ending with complex implications about the relation between art and life. Pratt's discussion of the poem focuses on these as- pects of the poem, but it is especially useful to consider them in the wider Victorian context of Arthurian poetry. The organizational concept of the Lamdins' book is admirable; unfortunately, I cannot recommend the book wholeheartedly because it contains various typographical and factual er- rors as well as superficial and reductive readings (not necessarily in the Arnold section). The issue of whether Arnold is essentially an elitist author, just touched on above in its modern context, has a long history, and Bill Bell's "Beyond the Death of the Author: Matthew Arnold's Two Audiences, 1888-1930" (in volume 3 of Book History [Pennsylvania State Univ. Press], edited by Ezra Greenspan and Jonathan Rose) offers a brief but enlighten- ing new study of how Arnold's image as an author "becomes historically perpetuated in and through the selection of texts after his death." Here the emphasis is on Arnold's poetry (which was widely assumed to appeal to a narrower audience than that of the more popularly oriented prose), although Bell discusses both genres. Arnold scholars will not be surprised by the contrast Bell draws between the literary journalists and gentlemen scholars - especially Oxford men - who had assumed from the beginning that Arnold's poetry was only for "a few readers with superior aesthetic dispositions" and those who argued for a popular Arnold. The great value of Bell's work is that he bases his generalizations on information from the archives of Arnold's publishers Macmillan and Smith &amp; Elder, combined</page><page sequence="22">434 I VICTORIAN POETRY with editorial commentary through the years, especially by the highly influential "mandarin" critics (including A. E. Housman, for example) who resisted the notion of Arnold's wide popularity at every turn and insisted on identifying the Victorian as an elitist appealing only to the most educated tastes- We learn, for example, that "in the years up to 1900, Macmillan alone would issue Arnold's poetry no fewer than thirty- three times, amounting to a total of more than one hundred thousand volumes" and "between 1890 and 1930 there were no fewer than seventy editions of Arnold's poetry on the market." More complex is the role played by copyright restrictions as an Arnold "canon" emerged through the years: "The textual Arnold . . . gradually emerged into the public domain over a period of more than forty years [18914938], throughout which time the choices of Arnold's editors and publishers were constrained by copyright limitation." Literary scholars who deal with authorial repu- tation and influence ought to welcome this kind of information about the sometimes overlooked and undervalued material conditions of textual production. Also welcome is a complex and suggestive study of Arnold's many journal publications by Kate Campbell, "Matthew Arnold and Publicity: A Modern Critic as Journalist" (in journalism, Literature and Modernity: From Hazlitt to Modernism, edited by Campbell [Edinburgh Univ. Press]). Campbell takes a fresh, theoretical look at the familiar issue of Arnold's sometimes controversial use of satire and "levity" in his prose and she analyzes his journalistic "performance." One interesting observation is that Arnold's professed ideals of disinterestedness and the dissemination of ideas correspond to the political thought of Immanuel Kant. She also argues that Arnold's criticism is "characteristic of a more modern form of publicity involving promotion and flair at reason's expense." Of related interest - because of Arnold's notable sparring with such newspapers as the Daily Telegraph, Morning Star, and Daily News - is Dallas Liddle's article "Who Invented the 'Leading Article'? Reconstructing the History and Prehistory of a Victorian Newspaper Genre" (Media History [1999] 5:5- 18). In a series of articles through the years, Brendan A. Rapple has reminded us that, in addition to his roles as poet and cultural critic, Arnold had a great deal to say specifically about education in such works as The Popular Education of France ( 1 86 1 ) , A French Eton ( 1 864) , and Schools and Universities on the Continent (1868). Arnold supplemented his thirty- five-year career as an inspector of elementary schools in England and Wales with service on governmental commissions that sent him on tours of Continental schools, and this experience led him, through compara- tive analysis, to locate defects in the ones back home. Rapple's latest</page><page sequence="23">CLINTON MACHANN / 435 article, "Matthew Arnold on the Inadequacies of Secondary Education in England" {Journal of Thought 35, no. 4: 75-88), summarizes and analyzes Arnold's critique of English secondary schools in his day: Arnold found an inadequate number of good schools, the absence of "proper control and securities," the poor quality of teachers, the neglect of "science" (that is, a rational and systemized method of learning and knowing) and standard- ization of curricula and texts, and a tendency toward the separation of classes. Like his earlier work, this article by Rapple shows us that Arnold's thinking about social and cultural issues was profoundly influenced by his practical views about education and the need for educational reform. In "Beyond Travellers' Tales: Some Nineteenth-Century British Commentators on Education in Germany" (Oxford Review of Education 26: 49-62), David Phillips notices that the O.E.D. credits Arnold with the first use of the term "secondary" to refer to post-elementary education in The Popular Education of France, In his discussion of Arnold, however, Phillips' focus is on the sections of Schools and Universities on the Continent that were reissued in 1874 as Higher Schools and Universities in Germany. Phillips credits Arnold with a "deep and scholarly understanding of what had made the German education system what it was" and an ability to "produce a powerful set of arguments by contrast for [education in] En- gland." In the chapter entitled "A Forerunner" from their book In Defence of High Culture (Blackwell, also published in The Journal of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain 34: 401-414), John Gingell and Edwin P. Brandon suggest that Arnold's ideas are still relevant to education today, and they use his concept of culture in Culture and Anarchy as an "Arnoldian filter, a principle we wish to urge for choosing much of what should form part of education in schools." Like Edward Alexander and other scholars in the past, Gingell and Brandon are interested in contrasting Arnold's ideas with those of John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, and they comment, "If we [like Arnold] accept that values are not some sort of fact discoverable by empirical inquiry then no amount of science or other factual study is going to be able to tell us how to live." Gingell and Brandon's sympa- thetic account of Arnold's demand for "exposure to the best that has been thought and done" concludes, however, with the observation that it is "a call to conflict, albeit non-violent, rather than peace and love." One recent doctoral dissertation making a contribution to Arnold studies is Elenor Frances Frame's "Matthew Arnold: Conceptualizing Free- dom" (University of South Carolina, DAI-A 60/12: 4439), which sets out to define Arnold's concept of individual freedom and relate it to his social and political ideas. Among the many recent dissertations that treat Arnold along with other Victorian authors, two stand out as especially interest-</page><page sequence="24">436 / VICTORIAN POETRY ing: Mary Margaret Grover, "Fleshing Out the Victorian Public Sphere of Letters (Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, and Charlotte Bronte)" (Uni- versity of Texas at Austin, DAI- A 61/08: 3183), and Lee Allan Behlman, "Faithful unto Death: The Postures of Victorian Stoicism" (DAI- A 61/ 10: 4003). A final note: last year in these pages I made a brief reference to James Wood's The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief (Random House); recently I noticed that Brooke Allen entitled his essay on that book in the Hudson Review (52: 671-676) "Shades of Matthew Arnold" and referred to Wood as "a modern Matthew Arnold." Elizabeth Barrett Browning MARJORIE STONE Last year in her review essay for this journal Dorothy Mermin wel- comed the growing tendency to approach EBB from a range of different angles. While the focus on gender issues in her works is "perhaps un- avoidable" and "certainly not undesirable," Mermin observed, "still, it would be nice to see critics thinking more of her more often as she would herself have liked, in a category other than that of a 'woman poet'" (p. 412). The material under review this year continues to expand the con- texts within which EBB's works are approached. Class issues, poetic tech- nique, religion, literary genealogies, and the politics of nation feature prominently in recent scholarship, although in many instances consider- ation of these subjects proves to be imbricated, as in the past, with the analysis of gender. There are promising new lines of investigation here, but also some instances where the work done might have been extended or deepened by building more fully on existing scholarship. For this rea- son, as well as others prompted by the material under review, this survey begins on a retrospective note. Among the scholarship one would like to see fuller use of is Mermin's own book, Elizabeth Barrett Browning: The Origins of a New Poetry (1989). More than a decade after its publication, this remains the most compre- hensive and indispensable study on EBB. Combining detailed textual analysis with literary biography, it is also the book that most fully inte- grates EBB's writing within the larger field of nineteenth-century litera- ture through its interwoven references to Wordsworth, Robert Browning, Tennyson, Arnold, the Rossettis, and many other authors. Although she emphasizes EBB's position at the "wellhead of a new female tradition," Mermin simultaneously considers her works in the context of important</page><page sequence="25">MARJORIE STONE / 437 themes and traditions in Victorian literature - the response to Romanti- cism, religious doubt, experiments with form and genre, innovations in amatory verse, and political debates, to name only a few. Thus, even though her own work has itself helped to shape the tendency to approach EBB as a "woman poet," it provides ample and suggestive grounds for investigat- ing the poet's large and variegated body of writings from other angles. Sandra Donaldson's edition of Critical Essays on Elizabeth Barrett Brown- ing (1999) offers similar grounds for new perspectives in future scholar- ship, while also encouraging a retrospective analysis of EBB's place in literary and cultural history as we enter a new century and millennium. Handsomely produced by G. K. Hall in the same series that includes Mary Ellis Gibson's Critical Essays on Robert Browning, this anthology brings together twenty-two essays published between 1962 and 1997. The mate- rials gathered here reflect the expertise in EBB's reception history that Donaldson earlier demonstrated in her 1993 compilation, Elizabeth Barrett Browning: An Annotated Bibliography of the Commentary and Criticism, 1 826- J990, also from G. K. Hall. The contents are judiciously chosen and organized, on the whole. Donaldson manages both to map the changing reception of EBB as the academy and the canon were altered by the twen- tieth-century women's movement, and to bring together essays treating a range of her works from a variety of critical perspectives. Donaldson's anthology indicates one reason why gender has tended to be so "unavoidable" a subject in EBB's case. As she points out in her introductory essay, this issue more than any other contributes to the dra- matic extremes evident in the reception history of the poet's works. Donaldson also reminds us that contributions to studies of EBB and espe- cially Aurora Leigh during the 1970s and 80s came from several prominent critics instrumental in shaping feminist literary criticism from a "wider theoretical perspective": among them, Ellen Moers, Cora Kaplan, Sandra Gilbert, Michele Barrett, Rachael Blau DuPlessis, and Barbara Charlesworth Gelpi (p. 8). Understandably, essays on Aurora Leigh outnumber those on other works in this collection. Donaldson includes Kaplan's groundbreaking "Introduction" to her 1978 Women's Press edition of EBB's novel-epic, together with the section on Aurora Leigh from the historic 1977 paper on "Women's Writing" by the Marxist-Feminist Literature Collective (in which Kaplan was a prominent figure) at the Essex Literature Conference . We also find here treatments of Aurora Leigh by Kathleen Hickok, Deirdre David, Holly Laird, Cynthia Scheinberg and (in part) Dolores Rosenblum. One regrettable omission is of any excerpt from the illuminating critical introduction to Margaret Reynolds' award-winning 1992 Ohio scholarly edition of Aurora Leigh, given that only a small portion of this is included in Reynolds' more widely disseminated Norton Critical Edition (1996).</page><page sequence="26">438 / VICTORIAN POETRY With so much to choose from in the case of Aurora Leigh, however, choices must have been difficult- There is also the question of balance. Donaldson fortunately avoids the too exclusive focus on Aurora Leigh and on gender issues that has obscured other widely influential works in EBB's canon and other points of departure for appreciating her writings- Thus we find a good range of essays in her collection, which includes Flavia Alaya's spirited essay on the Brownings' engagement with the Italian Risorgimento, a subject now attracting a good deal of attention in conferences and articles; Donaldson's own 1977 analysis of EBB's sonnets to George Sand; Helen Cooper's pioneering treatment of a range of EBB's works, first published in Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's 1978 collection, Shakespeare's Sisters; and an essay with similar range by Deborah Byrd on EBB's evolution as a feminist poet. There are also three analyses of the Sonnets from the Portuguese writ- ten from very different critical perspectives: Angela Leighton's in the context of ideologies of romantic love; Jerome Mazzaro's in the context of discourses of the sublime; and Mary Rose Sullivan's in the context of literary collaborations between the Brownings. In light of the attention that literary collaboration is now receiving in current issues of PMLA and in other places, Donaldson's decision to include not only Sullivan's fine essay on this topic, but also Mermin's essay on the Brownings' "Domestic Economy of Art" (not included in her book on EBB) is noteworthy. Other contributions include essays on "The Death of Pan" and Romanticism (by Margaret Morlier) and on the rhetoric of cursing in her political po- etry; a witty article on "Lady Geraldine's Courtship" by Glennis Stephenson (now Glennis Byron) subsequently incorporated in her 1989 study Eliza- beth Barrett Browning and the Poetry of Love; Alice Falk's investigation of EBB's Classical translations; the still very useful chapter on EBB's "Ex- periments in Poetic Technique" from Alethea Hayter's Mrs. Browning: A Poet's Work and Its Setting (1962); and finally, a suggestive essay by Daniel Karlin on EBB's overview of the history of English poetry in "The Book of the Poets." Framing Donaldson's collection chronologically, these last two es- says, by Hayter and Karlin respectively, point to relatively unexplored and promising angles of approach to EBB's works despite the years separating their publication. In the case of poetic technique (see below), we now have some excellent new studies, but critics have been slow to follow the example set by Karlin in paying systematic attention to the large body of literary criticism and poetics dispersed through EBB's letters, prefaces, and review essays. Donaldson's "Introduction" underlines another area in which much work remains to be done, in noting that no recent scholarly edition of her collected poems yet exists. Her introductory essay offers a</page><page sequence="27">MARJORIE STONE / 439 helpful overview of EBB scholarship, providing a survey of editions and bibliographical interest in EBB's works (some of the latter provoked by Thomas Wise's notorious forgeries), a summary of work on the reception history, and an account of feminist critical responses to EBB- It does not include the usual outline of the contributed essays customary in such collections, something that might have been particularly useful for stu- dents and for scholars relatively unfamiliar with work on the author. Some of the most stimulating recent work on EBB has addressed the politics and the technique of her rhyming practices in the Sonnets from the Portuguese and "The Dead Pan." In a vigorous and wide-ranging essay likely to be of interest to scholars of poetry in general as well as to specialists on EBB, Margaret M. Morlier's uSonnets from the Portuguese and the Politics of Rhyme" (VLC 27 [1999]: 97-112) reassesses the long tradi- tion of "fault-finding" with EBB's rhymes in light of new approaches to women's sonnets as literary performances rather than manifestations of artless sincerity. More originally, Morlier argues that in the Sonnets from the Portuguese, EBB "derived her formal strategies from Victorian political poetry, her structure from the political sonnet and her near rhymes from the poetry of social reform" (p. 98). At the same time, she finds in EBB's rhyming strategies evidence for an elitist "poetics of cognitive complex- ity" at ideological cross-purposes with these democratizing elements: a poetics that looks forward to twentieth-century theories of poetic lan- guage (p. 106). Combining informed historical research in nineteenth- century rhyming dictionaries with judicious use of modern authorities on rhyme like Louis Untermeyer and postmodern theorists such as Julia Kristeva and Paul Ricoeur, Morlier demonstrates the tensions produced by EBB's simultaneous identity as a "member of an underprivileged gender and a privileged class" (p. 98). As she points out, prefaces to nineteenth- century rhyming dictionaries "reveal how poetics continued to be shaped by values of race, class and gender" (p. 101). The great strength of her analysis, however, lies in her nuanced exploration of these intersecting variables. For example, while she locates the Sonnets from the Portuguese within the "feminine" tradition of amatory sonnets (perhaps underesti- mating the importance of male precursors such as Petrarch for EBB in this tradition), she also relates EBB's formal experiments to the tradition of the heroic political sonnet used by Milton and revived by Wordsworth, and her democratizing use of near rhymes to Thomas Hood's reformist poetry. Tim Sadenwasser adopts a different approach to similar subject mat- ter in "Rhyme, Form, and Sound in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's 'The Dead Pan'" (VP 37 [1999]: 521-538). Noting the "significant gaps" in EBB scholarship created by the focus on feminist issues, he rightly points</page><page sequence="28">440 / VICTORIAN POETRY out that careful analyses of her experiments with "rhyme, sound and form have been wanting," particularly given the copious evidence in her corre- spondence with Richard Hengist Home and others that the rhymes many attributed to carelessness were in fact the result of deliberate attempts to expand poetic possibilities. This neglect has persisted despite the compel- ling attention given to EBB's technical experiments and their impact on other writers by Fred Manning Smith in a 1939 PMLA article (somewhat inaccurately characterized by Sadenwasser as a catalogue of her rhyming deficiencies). Characterizing "The Dead Pan" as EBB's "most ambitious experiment in rhyming" (p. 522), Sadenwasser demonstrates how EBB manipulates both perfect and conspicuously deficient rhymes in the poem in carefully structured ways to convey phases in the narrative of paganism overcome by Christianity. Although this neoformalist analysis lacks the larger resonance that Morlier's essay acquires through its attention to political and social contexts, Sadenwasser's meticulously detailed close reading yields illuminating insights into both EBB's craft and her reli- gious argument. He argues, for example, that the notoriously imperfect rhyme of "islands" and "silences" in Stanza XXIX conveys "the separation between the pagan gods and their followers" (p. 525); similarly deficient rhymes elsewhere, he suggests, reflect the poet's skepticism of Roman Catholic "mediated religion" (p. 531). Taken together, these two essays suggest that EBB was not, in Germaine Greer's terms, a "slipshod sibyl," but rather a poet who deliberately set out to change the fashion in shoes, so to speak. They also indicate how much we might learn from further studies of EBB's experiments with rhyme, meter, and form, beginning with her early correspondence with Sir Uvedale Price on the sound of Greek poetry and the technical aspects of quantitative meter (an exchange passed over in both essays) and extending to her impact on subsequent poets such as Emily Dickinson and Wilfred Owen. The religious issues that enter into play in Sadenwasser's analysis are a central focus in several other new essays on EBB, following the welcome attention given to this important dimension of her work in Linda Lewis' Elizabeth Barrett Brownings Spiritual Progress (1998) and in some excellent articles by David Riede. In "'Neither keeping either un- der': Gender and Voice in Elizabeth Barrett's The Seraphim'" (VP 38 [2000]: 269-288), Julie Straight challenges the distrust of EBB's devotional po- etry rooted in the assumption that the logocentrism and hierarchical au- thority of Christianity limit the woman writer. Straight argues to the contrary that in The Seraphim EBB undercuts hierarchical oppositions between masculine and feminine by "depicting the transcendental signi- fied, the Logos or Word, in the 'female' position of weakness and death" (p. 271) and by conveying the wonder of the Incarnation through female</page><page sequence="29">MARJORIE STONE / 441 voices (including the voice of the Earth) and female tears- Straight some- what misleadingly implies that EBB altered the tradition by "changing the sex" of her angels and by referring to them as male (p. 275), when in fact the poet was drawing on a long tradition of representing the seraphim as masculine. Nevertheless, her perceptive analysis casts new light on the disruptions in gendered hierarchies first noted by earlier feminist critics writing on The Seraphim. Straight also advances this work through her consideration of the connections between female voices of various kinds and the representation of Christian poetic vocation. Other essays addressing the religious dimensions of EBB's poetry work with the more familiar ground of Aurora Leigh. In "The Gendered Imagination in Religion and Literature," published in John L. Mahoney's collection Seeing Into the Life of Things: Essays on Religion and Literature (1998), Philip C. Rule, S.J., considers Aurora Leigh along with The Prelude and biographies of John Keats to show how feminist writing has opened up "'exciting uncharted frontiers of interdisciplinary religious studies'" (p. 60). While the theological contexts in which he considers EBB are sug- gestive, more thought-provoking contexts for EBB's religious poetry and the questions it poses can be found in Dennis Taylor's opening theoretical essay on "The Need for a Religious Criticism," which makes no specific mention of her writings. Many of the general points that Taylor takes up - the susceptibility of religious poetry to parody, the role of story in religious experience, the problematics of privileging silence in religious literature, especially religious literature by women, and the historical role of religious discourse in subverting as well as supporting colonialist and patriarchal structures - might be usefully developed in discussions of her works. Katherine Renk's "Resurrecting the Living Dead: Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Poetic Vision in Aurora Leigh" (SBHC 23 [2000]: 40-49) ad- dresses the subject of Emmanuel Swedenborg's influence on EBB's reli- gious and poetic vision. Opening with an analysis of the persistent images in death she finds in Aurora Leigh, Renk covers some well travelled ground: for example, the passage presenting the death portrait of Aurora's mother. She does, however, offer a new biographical interpretation of these im- ages, rooted in EBB's description of herself as "buried" alive in a "morbid and desolate state" before her marriage to Robert Browning (p. 40). Swedenborg's philosophy offered EBB a spiritual vision that helped her to imagine the transfigurement of women buried alive by society, Renk sug- gests, advancing an argument anticipated in some respects by Linda Lewis' fuller treatment of these subjects in Elizabeth Barrett Brownings Spiritual Progress (which may not have yet appeared at the time Renk wrote her essay). As Renk points out, the vision of the New Jerusalem at the close</page><page sequence="30">442 I VICTORIAN POETRY of Aurora Leigh is "much like Swedenborg's," portraying not the second coming of Christ, but "a spiritual regeneration of humanity" (p. 46). While Renk emphasizes Blake along with Swedenborg as influences on the prophetic vision of Aurora Leigh, Chris R. Vanden Bossche and Laura E. Haigwood emphasize instead its affinities with Wordsworth in "Revising The Prelude: Aurora Leigh as Laureate" (SBHC 22 [1999]: 29- 39). Vanden Bossche and Haigwood acknowledge that Kathleen Blake's earlier essay in a 1986 issue of Victorian Poetry treats some of the connec- tions between Aurora Leigh and The Prelude that they discuss. Neverthe- less, they contribute to criticism by outlining a number of clear parallels between Wordsworth's epic and EBB's, while also pointing to the differ- ences that make Aurora Leigh a characteristically Victorian rather than Romantic work. That said, this is one essay that would have benefited from a fuller consideration of previous scholarship on EBB, including John Woolford's exploration of her response to Wordsworth in an earlier issue of the same journal, and treatments of the epic elements in Aurora Leigh by Holly Laird, Susan Stanford Friedman, and others. Some ques- tionable claims advanced in the course of the argument - for example, that the focus on the present age in Aurora Leigh marks a departure for the poet - might also have been revised if studies like Mermin's had been more fully utilized. The footnotes, however, include no reference to criti- cism on EBB published after 1986. In "Elizabeth Barrett Browning: Knowing Greek" (EIC 50 [2000]: 329-353), Jennifer Wallace turns to some classical translations by EBB that have received little or no attention in modern criticism: the various translations she undertook in 1845 for a "Classical Album" edited by a friend. Pointing out that EBB "chose to translate some of the most sentimental and erotic verses in the classical corpus" (p. 334), Wallace analyzes the changes between the original Greek and EBB's versions in Bion's "Lament for Adonis," and the passage from the Iliad in which Hector bids farewell to Andromache before going off to fight Achilles. Her elucidation of the intensified eroticism and the focus on female passions in these translations is compelling, although the recourse to biographical interpretation to explain such elements is more open to question. Can one simply attribute the eroticism and emphasis on female passions in these 1845 translations to EBB's attraction to the older blind scholar, Hugh Stuart Boyd, and her "association of reading Greek with lusting after withered masculinity" (p. 339)? By 1845, after all, her relationship with Boyd had long since lost the intensity that it had once had, and even in her 1831-32 diary, when her attraction to Boyd was at its height, one can see her beginning to rebel against his authority. Wallace also briefly considers the Christianizing changes in EBB's second translation</page><page sequence="31">MARJORIE STONE / 443 of Prometheus Bound, and, at greater length, some of the classical allusions in Aurora Leigh. Her treatment of the gender reversals in the much discussed comparison of Aurora in her father's "large / Man's doublet" to Achilles in female attire goes over familiar ground. More strikingly and suggestively, Wallace draws on Luce Irigaray's theories of mimicry to explore EBB's reworking of the Odysseus story and the performative elements that make her translations and classical allusions so radical. While Wallace explains the "bizarre ly sexy" (p. 331) nature of Greek and Latin for EBB in terms that are as much biographical as cultural, Barbara Neri offers a refreshing change from the usual emphasis on bio- graphical contexts in her approach to the work by the poet that seems most transparently personal, despite the "veil" of its title. In "A Lineage of Love: The Literary Bloodlines of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Sonnets from the Portuguese" (SBHC 23 [2000]: 50-69), Neri argues that one must consider both the influence of the "work and life of the Portuguese poet Luis de Camoens" on EBB, "as well as both poets' ties to Petrarch's tragic expressions of love" to appreciate how EBB's sequence enters into and transforms the "lineage" of amatory poetry (p. 50). Drawing on a good deal of interesting research on Camoens and his debt to Petrarch, Neri convincingly shows how several elements in the Sonnets from the Portu- guese, in particular the representation of melancholy love, derive as much from literary as from personal sources. She also calls in question the critical double standard that leaves EBB's famous sequence "mired in the personal," while more intellectual, philosophical, and artistic dimensions are attributed to Petrarch's and Camoens' love poetry (p. 62). There is support for Neri's emphasis on the "literary bloodlines" of EBB's love sonnets in the poet's manuscript notebooks of the early 1840s, as well as in a full-length study that she does not cite and that seems, unfortu- nately, to be too often neglected - Shaakeh Agajanian's "Sonnets from the Portuguese" and the Love Sonnet Tradition (1985). Although Agajanian lays more emphasis on the traditions connecting EBB's sequence to Spenser and Sidney than on its connections with Camoens, her study, like Neri's article, emphasizes the ways in which EBB writes within and against the sonnet tradition. Like Morlier's analysis of the "politics of rhyme" in the Sonnets from the Portuguese, Neri's analysis of its literary "lineage" stands in strong con- trast to Kerry McSweeney's brief treatment of the sequence in Supreme Attachments: Studies in Victorian Love Poetry (1998). In the one chapter out of seven that McSweeney allots to Victorian women poets collec- tively, he reiterates some of the charges traditionally directed at the poem's many faults, and dismisses its densely interwoven allusions to earlier lit- erature as signs of the "smell of the lamp." "To speak bluntly," he con-</page><page sequence="32">444 I VICTORIAN POETRY eludes, "in Sonnets from the Portuguese Barrett Browning was unable to make reciprocated sexual love poetically interesting" (pp. 64-65). In "Venetian Mirrors: Barrett or Browning as the Artist?," an essay included in The Author as Character: Representing Historical Writers in West- ern Literature (1999), Rosella Mamoli Zorzi notes a similar double stan- dard to the one that Neri objects to. Although the Brownings were both famous poets, she points out, they are not treated alike in fictional ac- counts. EBB is rarely presented as a character who is a poet (except in Virginia Woolf's Flush, where her dog is the main focus); in contrast, her husband is often represented as a writer, as in Richard Howard's dramatic monologues and in a short story by the Canadian author Jane Urquhart entitled "The Death of Robert Browning." Zorzi might have found sup- port for her argument in A. S. Byatt's Possession, but this is a text she does not discuss. One reason, of course, why EBB's life tends to spill over into discus- sions of her poetry is that generations of readers have found it so fascinat- ing: particularly the courtship phase. Daniel Karlin's review essay "Let- ters 'Alive and Quivering': Scholarly Approaches to the Brownings' Cor- respondence" (VS 42 [1999/2000]: 489-496), provides an expert analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches that have been taken to publishing the Brownings' letters. His essay responds to the appearance of the fourteenth volume in the magisterial edition of The Brownings' Correspondence, initially edited by Philip Kelly and Ronald Hudson, and since Hudson's death, by Kelly and Scott Lewis. Karlin testifies to the "exact and enlightening notes," the accuracy of the tran- scriptions, and the high standards of craftsmanship that have been con- sistently maintained in this indispensable resource for scholars on the Brownings and their wide circle of friends and correspondents (p. 490). The accuracy in transcriptions in The Brownings' Correspondence is par- ticularly important for those who have relied upon Elvan Kintner's 1969 annotated edition of The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett 1 845- 1 846 . Karlin notes that he found "hundreds of mistakes" in Kintner's transcriptions when he checked them against the holographs at Wellesley College Library in 1989 (p. 493). Three new articles also deal with the correspondence or biographi- cal matters associated with it. In "Charlotte Bronte and Elizabeth Barrett Browning: Incomparable Letter- Writers?" (BSN 26 [2000]: 55-68), Mar- garet Smith offers a lively analysis of the ways in which the two authors treat dramatic events and powerful feelings, their parallel skepticism of Jane Austen and veneration of Wordsworth, their similar views on women and marriage, and their contrasting styles of vocabulary and humor. EBB is credited with "a livelier wit than Charlotte" (p. 65), while Charlotte</page><page sequence="33">MARJORIE STONE / 445 sometimes expresses herself in "bold and slangy" terms that one cannot imagine in EBB's case (p. 63)- Richard S. Kennedy addresses the recurrent speculations that both of the Brownings, with their West Indian anteced- ents, may have had racially mixed heritages in another article in the same issue: "Disposing of a New Myth: A Close Look at Julia Markus' Theory About the Brownings' Ancestry" (BSN 26 [2000]: 21-47). Draw- ing on unpublished letters as well as a good deal of scholarship, Kennedy offers a detailed dissection of the inaccurate, hearsay evidence supporting R J. FunrivalPs 1890 article on "Robert Browning's Ancestors" in the Browning Society Papers. He then engages in a similar dissection of the claim that EBB inherited African blood, advanced most recently by Julia Markus in Dared and Done: The Marriage of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning (1995). "Even so, when all is said on both sides," Kennedy con- cludes, "what does it matter? In our semi-enlightened time it is no dis- grace to have a racially mixed heritage, and this certainly applies to Afri- can descent, against which prejudice has been strong" (p. 43). In an article that draws on two of the many letters by the Brownings that remain to be published, Alison Chapman casts new light on a later phase in EBB's life: her complicated relationship with the American me- dium and heiress Sophia May Eckley. As she points out in "Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Sophia Eckley: A Note on the End of the Affair" (N&amp;Q 240, New Series 48 [June 2001]: 144445), EBB seems to have come to a gradual decision to break off the relationship, influenced in part by Robert Browning's continued suspicion of '"speckly Eckley'" (p. 145). Chapman is also the author of one of two new articles focussed on issues of national identity, expatriation, and EBB's representation of Italy in Casa Guidi Windows. Hers, entitled "'All that I have dreamed and more': Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Florence," appears in the Journal of Anglo-Italian Studies 6 (2001): 127-137. The other, by Leigh Coral Harris, is "From Mythos to Logos: Political Aesthetics and Liminal Poetics in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Casa Guidi Windows (VLC 28 [2000]: 109- 131). Harris and Chapman both call in question Sandra Gilbert's influ- ential identification of Italy as a female matria of figure and legend for EBB and other nineteenth-century women writers, and both are con- cerned with the disjunction between aesthetic representations of Italy and the political realities of the Risorgimento that such readings perpetu- ate. In other respects, however, their approaches are strikingly different. Chapman's analysis adopts a biographical framework, beginning with ac- counts in EBB's letters that show her mapping of Florence as a scene of foreignness that is both familiar and unknowable: material and tangible yet ineffable, unrepresentable. Focussing on the Arno as the embodi-</page><page sequence="34">446 / VICTORIAN POETRY ment of this "double vision," Chapman reads it as "a figure for the poetic process overlaid with the desire for Italian national liberation" (p. 135). In contrast, Harris' emphasis falls firmly on the political, not the personal, as she notes how feminist biographical readings of Casa Guidi Windows have "disabled analysis" of the ways in which the poem marks the "shift in the representation of Italy in the British imagination from mythos ... to nationalized logos" from "a gendered aesthetic site" figura- tively colonized by the British empire to "Italy as an articulate, national space" (pp. 109-110)- Reading the poem as one of the most politically astute Victorian accounts of Italy, Harris argues that EBB's oblique allu- sions to Miltonic republicanism in the poem connect the aesthetic to the political, liberty in Britain to the politically charged cause of liberty in Italy. She finds further resonant representations of republican Italy in the poem's "hypermasculine figure" of Michelangelo's Brutus and the im- age of the female warrior Anita Garibaldi, set against the sexualized and depoliticized figures of romantic Italy. Images of a passive femininized "Italy enchained" give way to representations of the unfinished statue of an aggressive rebel and to a "real revolutionary woman on the battlefront" (p. 122). Fittingly, in an essay that explores the politicized functions of the aesthetic at multiple levels, Harris includes a detailed consideration of the response to Casa Guidi Windows, considering both its reception in Italy (where, she argues, its political feminism was either appropriated or not clearly understood), and its reception in England, where it was seen as "too fluid, too female, too Italian" (p. 125). As such terms suggest, while Harris is primarily concerned with the politics of nation, her essay also traces the complex intersections of national identity and gender iden- tity in EBB, her poem, and her reading publics. Much as Harris' illuminating article underlines the importance of more research on the interactions between British and Italian literary and political movements in the nineteenth century, Ann Swyderski's "Dickinson and 'that Foreign Lady - '" (Symbiosis 4 [2000]: 51-65) sug- gests how much we might learn from further work on trans-Atlantic con- nections between British and American writers. Swyderski usefully brings together many of the most important references to EBB in Emily Dickinson's poetry and letters, explores parallels between their passion for poetry and their lives, and offers readings of Dickinson's three elegies on the death of EBB: "I went to thank Her" (Poem #363), "I think I was enchanted" (Poem # 593), and "Her - last Poems'" (Poem # 312). Her interpretation of the last of these, one of Dickinson's more cryptic works, is particularly interesting. While Swyderski seems to draw on a wide knowledge of Dickinson criticism, however, her essay relies on relatively dated constructions of EBB's poetic achievement, making very little use</page><page sequence="35">MARY ELLIS GIBSON / 447 of the scholarship that has been produced since Gardner Taplin's 1957 The Life of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. One is left with the sense that much remains to be done in exploring this poetic relationship, giving sustained attention not only to Aurora Leigh but also to other works by EBB that seem to have had a particularly powerful impact on Dickinson, "A Vision of Poets" prominently among them. The investigation of EBB's writing from a range of perspectives in this year's work reflects a pattern also evident in the call for papers issued by the organizers of a symposium on Elizabeth Barrett Browning, jointly hosted by the English Departments of Cambridge University and Anglia Polytechnic University in June 2000. Their explicit invitation that scholars consider other works than Aurora Leigh, and that they investigate the intellectual, religious, political, scientific, and material contexts of these works, gave rise to a very interesting program. As more scholarship of this kind finds its way into print, there is good reason to hope that many hitherto neglected aspects of EBB's works and their place in nineteenth- century literary history will receive the more multi-faceted attention that Mermin called for. Robert Browning MARY ELLIS GIBSON Melancholia, mourning, narcissism, religious belief , the poet's power. This year's essays on Robert Browning's poetry have returned to the terri- tory that so fascinated the late Victorians. What lies beyond death? How do art, eros, and theology shape our notions of the infinite and the finite, of the life in time and something else beyond or within it? Although this has been the thinnest year in many for Robert Brown- ing studies, yielding a clutch of articles, many of them limited in scope, the essayists of Browning's work have returned as if by coincidence to central questions of art and the spiritual and physical life. As A. S. Byatt put it in a lecture for the Browning Society published last year, "Putting the infinite within the finite is both a description of the Incarnation, a description of the making of works of art and a description of Browning's own baffled, glorious and exasperated sense of his own confinement in his own body, his own history, his own time and space" ("'Half-Angel and Half-Bird,'" BSN 26 [2000] 7-20). Byatt focuses on Browning's "Epistle of Karshish"; other writers have recently tackled "Cleon," "A Death in the Desert," and various poems of love or mourning. Taken together</page><page sequence="36">448 / VICTORIAN POETRY these essays revisit Browning's "glorious and exasperated" sense of con- finement - in the fleshly body, in time, in the body of history, in the latter days of a religion based in historical claims- It is a treat - and something of a minor revelation - to imagine A.S. Byatt reading "Karshish" "earlier than any modern child would" (p. 7). While "Karshish" was a central focus of her talk, Byatt ranges over Browning's poetry to emphasize his metaphors for passionate experience, art, and religion. Browning makes "an extended metaphor of himself as a lighthouse, a container of light . . . confined, walled up, rather than broken by a prism," Byatt says (p. 8). In a letter to Elizabeth Barrett, Browning calls himself a lighthouse, metaphorically expressing a "con- suming desire to live life to the full, which may take the forms of ambi- tion and love, as well as darker forms in his demons and destroyers" (p. 8). Byatt notes, as many have, that Browning cannot write out of a "white light" only - when he does so in Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day the result is "inert." Byatt prefers the monologues which like the lighthouse are con- tainers of consciousness. The monologues in Men and Women, Byatt ar- gues, are themselves "a series of closed and bounded worlds, nomads al- most, men and women looking out through their eyeholes or slits in their light-houses at what they can see or illuminate. . . . RB's forms and his greatness are bound up with his sense of our confinement in history and our own bodies, and of our wish to think and feel our way out of these closed places, our sense that we are not separate, not closed off (p. 12). Byatt examines this tension between separation and fusion in a num- ber of Browning's love poems, including "Two in the Campagna" and the "Lyric Love" passage from The Ring and the Book, She reads "Karshish" through these same tensions and metaphors. In the course of the poem, Byatt says, "RB's whole poem, and Karshish's intelligence, and our imagi- nation, mediated by Karshish and RB, with their earthly intelligences, reaches Lazarus's privileged knowledge, a mortal, twice incarnate glimpse of the blaze through the slits" (p. 15). In "One Word More," in "Lyric Love," in the "Epilogue to Dramatis Personae" Browning pushes against the limits of the poet as monad, the tension inherent in individuation. In The Ring and the Book, Browning's "images for his own work... are intri- cate and strange, and like Karshish, less fierce and strange when summed up than when experienced" (p. 18). But, Byatt concludes, these images are all founded in the notion of "resurrection, breathing life into the inanimate" (p. 18). I particularly appreciate Byatt's insistence on Browning's fierce strangeness - which is all too easy to naturalize in the language of criticism. Joseph Dupras and Michael Johnstone, like Byatt, examine the ways Browning's treatment of incarnation connects to his notions of art. Both</page><page sequence="37">MARY ELLIS GIBSON I 449 Dupras and Johnstone recognize melancholy as the shadow of religious skepticism, and both remind us of Browning's insistence that partial knowledge is the human condition- Johnstone 's "Truth has a Human Face" revisits "A Death in the Desert" in terms of Browning's philosophy of language and in its historical relationship to the Higher Criticism. Like Donald Hair, Johnstone considers Browning's view of language as essential Lockean; for Browning, as for Locke, the truth of propositions is inseparable from the "particles," the connective, combinative, relational aspect of language. Though Locke understood truth as arising from propositions that turned on these particles, Carlyle, an equally important influence on Browning, insisted that metaphor or symbol acted as the connecting "particle." When Browning examines Ernst Renan's historicization of the gospels, he takes Jesus to represent "the linking, connective aspect of language - he provides the predicates, the Particles, and is the conjunction and preposition and copula" (p. 369). Johnstone argues that Browning touches and extends the line of influence of the Johannine gospel. For Johnstone, Browning's Jesus in "A Death in the Desert" exemplifies the "changeable element of language, the element of combination that shifts and varies either arbitrarily (Locke) or historically (Carlyle)" (p. 371). Johnstone ignores the contradiction between Carlylean symbols and the Lockean skepticism that Carlyle himself wished to overcome. It may be more accurate to see Browning's poem as created in the contradictions rather than the harmony of these views. In a sense, Johnstone makes such a move by relying on Elinor Shaffer's argument, which I too find compelling, that Browning furthered the Higher Critical notion of progressive revelation. Johnstone 's contribution here is not, perhaps, his notion of Browning's approach to language, but his argument that in "A Death in the Desert" "the nature of witness... deals constantly with the nature of its object's absence and loss" (p. 375). Joseph Dupras' "The Promise of Converting Poets in Robert Browning's 'Cleon,'" also published in VP [38 (2000): 249-68], forms a companion piece to Johnstone's. Like Johnstone, but more squarely, Dupras addresses the connection between skepticism and melancholia, beginning indeed with a passage from Thomas Browne's Urn Burial Dupras reads Browning's monologue as interrogating the nature of rest and the differ- ence between rest and spiritual striving. Like Byatt, Dupras is fascinated with Browning's towers - here Protus's tower. Dupras argues, "This recur- ring image of Protus' tower represents Cleon's idee fixe, one which he and Browning's readers must continue to remount for it to edify: Victorians as well as ancient Hellenes, Christians as well as pagans, lose their souls if they stop working when they are atop the world" (p. 251). As if he himself were in such a tower - but without slits - Cleon is sealed in his</page><page sequence="38">450 / VICTORIAN POETRY own self-consciousness. Thus, "isolation is the core of his moroseness. Cleon's skepticism and collapse are the horror of a 'soul alone.'" Thus Dupras argues that Cleon, unlike his creator, cannot properly value gener- osity. Cleon cannot respond to the generosity of Protus, of the slave girl he sends, or to the generosity implicit in Paul's message. Cleon underes- timates what is before him in all sorts of ways; his hunger for closure is the foundation of his melancholy. While Dupras' argument is a significant contribution to our under- standing of one of Browning's most important monologues, occasionally his penchant for quotation obscures the force of the critic's voice and blurs his argument. Dupras, for example, argues that Browning requires strenuous readers, saying "understanding how nascent Christianity struck a doleful contemporary has to be more strenuous than just reading the writing on the wall or on the page" (p. 252). The allusion to Browning's allusion to Wordsworth creates more texture in this passage than Dupras' argument requires. Nonetheless, his reading of Cleon in late Hellenic culture deepens our understanding of the ways Browning approached art and melancholy. If melancholia is endemic to religious skepticism and to the heightened self-consciousness of an artist like Cleon, absence and loss also characterize the process of reading and writing, according to John Woolford. In "'The Mesmeric Effort': Picture, Language and Silence in Browning's Theory of Representation," Woolford argues that for Browning mesmerism signifies "a perfect model of poetic transmission, a model from which the actual writer- reader relation always represents a decline" (BSN 27 [2000]: 5-20). The gap between expression and language and between text and reader causes Browning to imagine author and reader fused. Such fusion in turn parallels the "impossible desire of lovers to become one person" (p. 5). Like Johnstone, Woolford returns to Locke's theory of language - but Woolford emphasizes not the creation of propositions but the Lockean principle that simple ideas "are private in their reference" (p. 6). Like Dupras, then, Woolford is interested in Browning's conception of language as failing to overcome each individual's imprisonment in his or her own consciousness. Following this line of thought into Edmund Burke and Hazlitt, Woolford notes that the apparent solution to the dilemma of language is gesture - but gesture cannot be transmitted in a poem: "The problem, then, is to find a substitute for gesture, a device or concept of a device, capable of transmitting meaning in a printed text independently of its visible lexicon" (p. 8). Mesmerism furnishes a metaphor, at least, of such gestures. Woolford takes from Browning's marginalia to Sordello the suggestive phrase, "mesmeric song." Truly mesmeric song would allow the poet or orator to control an "audience's</page><page sequence="39">MARY ELLIS GIBSON I 451 responses directly" (p. 9)- But how to represent this fusion or control? Woolford suggests this problem is at the root of Browning's fascination with "workers in the non-verbal arts" and with the depiction of silence. (Surely Carlyle is an important influence here as well, and for some of the same reasons.) Woolford takes these tropes into readings of "In a Gondola" and "Rudel to a Lady of Tripoli." Here the fusion of lovers, should it happen, mirrors the fusion of gesture through the non-verbal, through silence. Woolford concludes, "The image formed during the course of reading, then, cannot be the effect of description in the text of that of which the image is a reflection, but results from a mysterious transmission which traverses the text unmodified by its phonetic/graphemic approximations. It is mesmeric" (p. 17). Now of course this whole string of metaphors is about the poet's own interpretation of hermeneutic matters; it makes no claims about the actual way readers respond to mesmeric song. In fact, it would seem to me that readers must respond not to mesmerism but to the idea of mesmeric song - or as Browning puts it in The Ring and the Book to "galvanism for life." As Woolford puts it, "the initial privitisation of the discourse presents an ontological problem which remains unsolved" (p. 17). Browning does provide a kind of solution - "For where Wordsworth expects his sister and Coleridge's wife to understand him in 'Tintern Ab- bey' and 'The Aeolian Harp' respectively, RB's analysis discovers that even these privileged relationships cannot issue in communication unless an affinity is presupposed which will allow words to be by-passed, and that the extension of such relationships to embrace the idea of a public can be supported only by the extension of the principle of affinity into a theory of mesmerism" (p. 17). It may be a stretch to claim that Browning's ex- tension of notions of affinity to the public can only be supported by a notion of mesmerism. A still less tractable problem is the claim of si- lence; for silence can only result, at its logical conclusion, in ruthless poetic closure. At the end of "One Word More," for example, the poet claims affinity with EBB, but he can only do so if he can shut the world out, "hush" and bless himself "with silence." Mesmerism is but the char- acterological form, it seems to me, of "negative capability" - another sec- ond order Romantic answer to the failure of Wordsworthian rhetoric. As if all this failed affinity and melancholic skepticism weren't enough, Adrian Wisnicki and George Horneker look directly at issues of mourning in Browning's poetry. In "Some Kinds of Melancholia: Mourn- ing in Four Poems by Robert Browning" (Browning Society Notes 27 [2000]: 46-67), Wisnicki examines "Evelyn Hope," "Prospice," "Too Late," and "May and Death." Wisnicki takes Freud's definitions of melancholia and its causes in narcissism and the loss of an Ideal object as a framework</page><page sequence="40">452 I VICTORIAN POETRY for reading "Evelyn Hope" - who is as much an imaginary as a real woman to the poem's speaker. The speaker's narcissism and his idealized attach- ment in turn induces a crisis of "manliness." For in both "Evelyn Hope" and "Prospice," Wisnicki argues, the speaker is feminized. In "Prospice" Browning "occupies a dual feminine position, both as the comforter of the dying EBB and as a person characterized by excessive imagination. He counters this situation by positioning himself, within his fantasy, as a 'strong man' involved in an almost mythological struggle, one foreshad- owed in 'Evelyn Hope'" (p. 58). Such a struggle verges on what Freud characterizes as mania - the state of mind succeeding melancholia. Thus Browning and his speakers become the manly and manic mourner. This mourner reappears in "Too Late," but in such a serious condition of nar- cissistic melancholia that manic release is out of the question; Wisnicki speculates that the poem's end implies the speaker's desire for suicide. Wisnicki cautions, justly I think, that his choice of poems may seem somewhat arbitrary. But his proposed extension of this line of inquiry is promising: "Perhaps we could even move to a broader level. Given the attempts by Browning and his speakers to affirm their masculinity, we might consider our poems in the context of British imperialism" (p. 64)- We might indeed. One has only to think of Tennyson's "Maud" to find a poem that provides an even purer example of the psychic structures Wisnicki describes. Also investigating the nature of mourning is George Horneker's "How Do I Mourn Thee? Browning's La Saisiaz: The Two Poets of Croisic" (PAPA 26 [2000]: 23-32). Horneker asks why Browning, ignoring elegiac tradition, would conceive of a poem like La Saisiaz as a memorial to his friend Anne Egerton Smith. He argues that the poem does "attempt the basic elegiac movement from grief to consolation." This movement, how- ever, is really characterized by what Browning himself called "mere grey argument" (p. 29). The exploration of argument rather than elegiac con- vention leads Horneker to posit La Saisiaz as the most personal of Browning's poems since Christmas-Eve. (Pace "One Word More" and parts of The Ring and the Book, I would add.) Two Poets, Horneker argues, is an appendage to the first, extending the questions of poetic fame merely touched on in "La Saisiaz." Like the poems themselves, Horneker's analy- sis tells us very little about the poet and mourning. Perhaps all this talk of melancholia and mourning (or its impossi- bility) suggests it is time for a fuller consideration of the ways Victorian mourning, melancholia, manliness and self-consciousness, not to men- tion narcissism, play out in Browning's poetry. The Ring and the Book is an obvious starting point. And finally, those interested in irony and Browning's paired lyrics</page><page sequence="41">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 453 may find of interest Gerard Steen's "Language, Text and Discourse: Rob- ert Browning's 'Meeting at Night' and 'Parting at Morning'" (in Contextualized Stylistics: In Honour of Peter Verdonk, ed. Tony Bex et. al. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2000: 195-208). Though theme is not Steen's pri- mary concern (he wishes to argue for a scientific rather than a hermeneu- tic approach to intertextual connections and reading), these poems too suggest an interesting starting point for reconsidering Browning, manli- ness, and mesmeric song. I would challenge readers who have persisted to the end of this review to reconsider Ezra Pound's question of Robert Browning, "What's left for me to do?" Is a paucity of work this year mere coincidence or part of a larger pattern? In a period when readers often lack patience with long poems, where students are rarely trained or encouraged to read them, what sort of audience will Browning find? What questions will motivate new readers readers of Browning? Will "mesmeric song" become a relent- lessly empty gesture? Thomas Hardy ROSEMARIE MORGAN If we were to evaluate Hardy's current standing as a poet solely in the light of the quality and quantity of literary criticism recently brought into full-length book publication we might well believe him to have lost the far-reaching interest he commanded over the last century. Paucity of books and poverty of content noticeably complement each other. Take for example the single most substantial book-length study produced in the year 2000: Amitav Banerjee's An Historical Evaluation of Thomas Hardy's Poetry (Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 2000), 418 pages. This book sports, in chronological order, twenty-five short pieces, all extracts from works written in the twentieth century. With one or two exceptions (which will be noticed later) the critical talent lies almost exclusively in the first half of the twentieth century. The book opens with Edmund Gosse's "Mr Hardy's Lyrical Poems" (pp. 19-42, reprinted from the Edinburgh Review, 1918). Keen to delineate Hardy's passionate love of mankind Gosse remains Hardy's most powerful advocate in his revolt against Keats 's prescription of "load[ing] the rifts with ore." John Middleton Murry follows with "The Poetry of Mr Hardy" (pp. 43-49, reprinted from The Athenaeum, 1919). Renowned for his un- failing devotion to Hardy, whose poems, Murry says, become a part of his own being - their "indelible impress has given shape to dumb and striving elements, in our soul" - never, for an instant, swerves from his admira-</page><page sequence="42">454 I VICTORIAN POETRY tion for Hardy: "no poet since poetry began has apprehended or told us more. Sunt lacrimae rerum" (p. 49). I. A. Richards' "Thomas Hardy: Con- temporary Poet" follows (pp. 50-52, reprinted from Criterion, 1924-25) but his essay is too clumsily truncated by the editor, Banerjee, to be of much value. The same can be said of T S Eliot's "Thomas Hardy" (pp. 53- 54, reprinted from After Strange Gods, 1933), whose single paragraph fails to equitably represent either Eliot or Hardy. Likewise Ezra Pound's scant fragments (pp. 55-56) from Guide to Kulchur (1938), and Philip Larkin's meager apologia on Hardy's behalf (pp. 131-133, reprinted from The Lis- tener, 1968), which does justice to absolutely no one. This is a most unex- pected encounter - of all people, Larkin, whose debt to Hardy is immea- surable and certainly no literary secret! At this point, W. H. Auden's less cursory "A Literary Transference" - delightfully redolent of that quirky, introspective style of his - fills a much needed gap. There is nothing diminished or diminishing about Auden's piece: he not only affirms that "it was Hardy who first taught me some- thing of the relations of Eros and Logos," but also marches on vigorously with his enthusiasms eagerly to the fore (pp. 57-66, reprinted from the Southern Review, 1940). David Perkins tends, on the other hand, to amble rather aimlessly through "Hardy and the Poetry of Isolation" (pp. 67-87, reprinted from the Journal of English Literary History, 1959), where, by contrast, John Crowe Ransom's "Thomas Hardy's Poems, and the Reli- gious Difficulties of a Naturalist" (pp. 88-100, reprinted from the Kenyon Review, 1960) grapples valiantly with the theological configurations of Hardy's verse. This is no easy task but the narrative tone remains probing, sincere, and compassionate, as befits Hardy's own theological concerns. Irving Howe's firm grasp of essentials - the rhythmic foot, the chiaroscuro effects, the rhetorical compression in Hardy's short lyrics - follows in "The Short Poems of Thomas Hardy" (pp. 101-133, reprinted from the South- ern Review, 1966). Sadly, this first half of An Historical Evaluation - influential as these poet-critics most certainly are - barely touches the surface of what James Gibson in his Thomas Hardy: Interviews and Recollections (St. Martin's Press, 1999) elsewhere calls a "veritable embarrassment of riches" where Hardy's distinguished (but oft-neglected) twentieth-century contemporary critics are concerned. Every single item in the Banerjee selection is already in print and in some cases copiously anthologized. Is this duplication the best An Historical Evaluation can do and if so why are these pieces not then, themselves, evaluated, placed in context, and critically examined? Thorn Gunn now introduces the latter third of the twentieth cen- tury with "Thomas Hardy and the Ballads" (pp. 134- 148, reprinted from his Bain-Swiggett Lecture at Princeton University, 1970). As befits Historical</page><page sequence="43">ROSEMARIE MORGAN I 455 Evaluation which is openly conservative in selection, superficial in its survey approach and aimed, I would think, at a non-specialist readership, Gunn's piece appears to have been chosen for its proprietorial reserve - its highest praise being that "much of what sustains me through the flat- ter part of the Collected Poems is this feeling of contact with an honest man who will never lie to me" (p. 147)- Good old honest-Hodgean-Hardy! Good too, that despite the sad lack in his development as a poet - "he didn't go through the dramatic developments of style that we find in many of the writers who have been of most weight for modern readers" - he did, according to Gunn, find "a way of writing large and open enough to last him for a long life-time, and in which he could realise most of his greatest poems" (p. 135)- "Most?" What happened to the rest, one won- ders? This "lack in his development" appears to stem from Hardy's failure to "change from the style which he came into at the outset" (quoted by Gunn from John Crowe Ransom, p. 134). What "style" is this? It strikes me that even a random look at Wessex Poems of the late 1800s, compared with, say, The Dynasts of the early 1900s, shows up sufficient stylistic differences over what is, in some cases, a thirty-year period, to render this assertion of non-development completely empty. Even the briefest look at some of the verses in these works suggests this. Take, for instance, the poetic themes on the Napoleonic wars so dear to Hardy's heart - from youth to his old age. The themes may be unchanged but the voices are noticeably different, as are the stylistic devices, as are the philosophical and sociological perspectives. Both "The Sergeant's Song" and "The Peasant's Confession" (Wessex Poems) feature the Napoleonic battle- themes but each employs the voice vernacular, as does "Valenciennes" - which goes one step further and introduces dialectal forms, to wit: "There may be volk whose judgement o'en is mean." The central speakers in The Dynasts are, contrariwise, literary-poetical - consonant with the classic dramatic forms of traditional Greek tragedy on which The Dynasts is modelled. To take a few examples from The Dynasts: at the point at which the French army, under Emperor Napoleon, is warring with the Austrian Empire, under Emperor Francis, for possession of Aspern and Essling, an aide-de-camp enters the latter's headquarters at the mansion of Wolkersdorf and eloquently reports to his Emperor that We have born them back through Aspern village-street And Essling is recovered. What counts more, Their bridges to the rear we have nearly grasped, And panic-struck they crowd the few left free, Choking the track, with cries of "All is lost!" (IV, iii)</page><page sequence="44">456 / VICTORIAN POETRY Consider now, by contrast, the folk-balladic style of "Corp'l Tullidge" ("Valenciennes," Wessex Poems) speaking of comparable maneuvers taking place during the Napoleonic wars with Britain, a few years earlier in his- torical time: We trenched, we trumpeted and drummed, And from our mortars tons of iron hummed Ath'art the ditch, the month we bombed The Town o' Valencieen. (Complete Poetical Works, ed. Hynes, 1:24) Not even the servants, in The Dynasts - in this next instance a char- acter based on one Samuel Clark of Dorset - express themselves in the rich dialectal forms of "Corp'l Tullidge-" As the drama nears conclusion the aforementioned officer's servant enters the scene to give the latest news bulletin to the members of the British camp near Mont Saint-Jean: I have just seen a charge never beholded since the days of the Amalekites! The squares still stand, but Ney's cavalry have made another attack. Their swords are streaming with blood, and their horses' hoofs squash out our poor fellows' bowels as they lie. A ball has sunk in Sir Thomas Picton's forehead and killed him like Goliath the Philistine. (VII, v) This is not the roistering cheerleader's voice of "The Sergeant's Song" or "Valenciennes." Nor does it have the subversive edge of the Napoleonic rustic in "The Peasant's Confession" who tells of his successful if treacher- ous attempt, during the battle of Waterloo, to save his woodland hut, family, farm, and livelihood, from the scourges of warfare by deliberately leading the bearer of "the Emperor's mandate" in the wrong direction: "We hoped thenceforth no army, small or vast / Would trouble us again." No - the voice of the servant in The Dynasts is neither individual- ized nor particularized in this way. He has a role - the role of messenger, scene-setter, but no especial stance, no precise point-of-view, no personal story (aside from being the person required to tell a small portion of the story), no identity, not even that of "Hodge." That he is accorded an "educated" voice - employing vividly descriptive language, accurately nam- ing names and drawing apt analogies - distinguishes him yet further as a role -player, a narrator in the dramatic action but not a character who is central to it. Unlike the "Peasant" he effects no historical change. Unlike the "Sergeant" he sets no tone, establishes no satirical stance, offers no subjective insights, advances no slant on history. It is interesting to note that women and children are in attendance</page><page sequence="45">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 457 in the Mont Saint-Jean scene from The Dynasts - dressing the wounds of the soldiers, shredding lint for dressings and, in the case of the young women, giving birth under the shelter of trees at the back of the camp; significantly, they are given a voice (or voices) of a similar kind to that of the servant: dramatically expedient, articulate but impersonal-choric, pe- ripheral to the central action. It is left to the deeply implicated speaker of "San Sebastian" (Wessex Poems) to give the more brutal account of the very real fate suffered by many "enemy" women in war-zones. He speaks of watching his lovely seventeen-year-old daughter dancing "in her muslin bowed with blue," and being bitterly remorseful as he is jolted back to a recollection of "The maiden I wronged in Peninsular day" - the young Spanish girl, also an innocent teenager, he had years ago chased and trapped and raped as 'She raised her beseeching eyes to me, And I heard the words of prayer she sent In her own soft language.' (CPV7, 1:29) Thus, stylistically, there have been radical changes. Balladic form has been replaced, in the later work, by epic-heroic, the rhythmic foot has become elongated, de-regulated; mood and tone have become elevated; focus is more upon the dramatic apparatus of myth; accent and voice have become detached, adopting personifications, performing personified ab- stractions, shifting from what Northrop Frye might have called the "demotic" style of the soldier, peasant, or sergeant to the "hieratic" style of formal rhetoric and public speech, the illocutionary act. Even the world view has changed - in narrative terms there is a shift from the monologue or limited perspective of the soldier, the sergeant, the peasant, to the point of view of the chronicler, frequently implying an omniscient ob- server. And from the moral standpoint there is a distinct move from the existentialist or deterministic concerns of individuals struggling with free will and responsibility to the communal, societal struggle with and against forces shaped by historical events and political agencies, not to mention the "Immanent Will." It is worth recalling here that Hardy's conception of the First Cause or Prime Mover is that of an "Immanent Will" which remains blind, indifferent, inert, and unconscious in the face of humanity's despair, mankind's sense of hopelessness and nihilism; the "Immanent Will" has yet to come to consciousness as an engine of causality, as an agency of change if it is ever to overcome mankind's sense of its meaning- lessness. There are, of course, many more signs of stylistic development in Hardy's poetry aside from the evolution of the early Napoleonic pieces with their attendant ballad singers, who will, or should, quite appropriately,</page><page sequence="46">458 I VICTORIAN POETRY become deracinated, anaesthetised even, as the speakers - particularly those modelled on Dorset denizens in the early poems - step from homeland scenes into the "theatre" (Hardy's coinage) of war itself, as dramatized in The Dynasts. These latter developments are but a small part of the whole- There is no room here to explore all the details but I think, for example, it is true to say that dialectal forms, which lend their own special color and shape to the world, feature less and less in Hardy's poetry as time goes by - as they also diminish in the prose works. And I would hazard a guess that an unabashed onomatapoeia increasingly preoccupies the poet as it does the novelist whose narrator frequently presents the reader with sound effects (so to speak) that are unpleasant and disturbing - in other words, onomatopoetic. Take the following: Iridescent bubbles of dank subterranean breath rose from the sweat- ing sod . . . hissing as they burst and expanded to join the vapoury firmament above. (Far From the Madding Crowd, chap. 43) Yes - this is the moment of Bathsheba's self-disgust, self-hatred, following the appalling coffin scene and Troy's repudiation of her. Or take Tess's heated, eroticized body which, by close association with the natural world of "pure" sexuality, conjoins not with the hothoused lilies-and-roses variety of artificially perfumed bowers of bliss but with the sap-filled, milky-ooze of field-flowers and the bursting pollen-heads of swollen grasses (Tess of the D'Urbervilles, chap. 19). This is, mutatis mutan- dis, the onomatopoeia of the older poet who writes, infuriated, about a critic who attacked the poem "On Sturminster Foot-Bridge" for its ugly "cluck" water-sucking sound effects. Donald Davie pieces together some of this stylistic development in his oft-anthologized "Hardy's Virgilian Purples" (pp. 163-178, reprinted from Agenda, 1972). There is a patronizing tone to this essay. There is carping. These attitudes Hardy has rendered unfashionable long, long ago. He is no longer struggling to earn a reputation as Davie (and, I suppose, Banerjee) appears to think. On a yet- lower rung of the scholarly ladder, Eugenio Montale's "A Note on Hardy the Poet" (pp. 180-181, reprinted from Agenda, 1972) also falls into desuetude. Here we are in- formed that Hardy supplied to the English language "countless archaisms, noted in the Oxford Dictionary [sic]." To be sure Hardy revived many archaisms. But the Oxford English Dictionary was far more innovative than this - and so was Hardy. The O.E.D. did not simply record Hardy's ar- chaisms; it actually listed all his known neologisms, reputedly well over a thousand words in total, many of which had originally so irritated his editors that they would strike them out of his manuscripts - words we take for granted today, such as "emotional" and "phenomenal." I'm no</page><page sequence="47">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 459 philologist- But surely, if one is going to delve into this topic one should be! In a millennium publication on an historical evaluation of Hardy- the-poet there should be informed evaluation: what the O.E.D. did with Hardy's contribution to the English language is thorough, well-researched, and scholarly, as should be any works reporting on its achievement. The same complaint might be levelled at Banerjee's own essay, "Philip Larkin and Thomas Hardy" (pp. 181-197, reprinted from Literary Half -Yearly , 1981) which "delves" not at all into its topic but does spend some seventeen pages on Larkin while concluding, with remarkable facility, after effec- tively marginalizing Hardy, that, Hardy thus deals with ideas that the readers of his time were famil- iar with, and he approaches those ideas in a manner that makes them easily accessible. That is to say, Hardy tackles the contempo- rary philosophical ideas not from the perspective of a philosopher but rather from that of a sensitive human being. While this method kept his poetry nearer to the reader (although, of course, it some- times brought him into conflict with him) it also widened his poetic vision of life. (p. 191) If "familiar?" then surely "accessible"? Contradictions aparat, I'm urged to say, "What of the outrage and censorship of and by Hardy's contempo- raries - what of the persecution he experienced at the hands of his critics, particularly in the case of his novels?" but I doubt readers need these urgings, so enough said! Returning to conservative values and outmoded ideas in Historical Evaluation, "Yeats or Hardy," by Richard Hoffpauir (pp. 198-220, reprinted from Southern Review, 1983), rather refreshingly presents its own discover- ies of "certain old-fashioned pieties" among Hardy's critics (p. 201). In the development of twentieth-century poetry in English Hoffpauir notes the necessity to distinguish between the two seminal poets, Yeats and Hardy, whose long careers spanned the transition from Romanticism to Modernism and whose work constitutes two of the most powerful dealings with that transition and those traditions (p. 198). In his brief examination of the strengths of Hardy's poetry, Hoffpauir offers late twentieth-century literary critics an example of solid accom- plishment - not simply his own but also (more importantly) that of his subject - free of unwarranted condescending attitudes and a resentful, carping tongue. He relies solely upon the lean and clean statement in eliciting what is the priceless gift of Hardy's poetry, his moral authority, and profound humanitarianism:</page><page sequence="48">460 / VICTORIAN POETRY I mean only to illustrate the possibilities for sanity, order, sensitivity, and moral integrity in the twentieth century, a century in which too many poets have taken their cue from W. B.Yeats and too few from Thomas Hardy, (p. 220) This could have been the turning point in Banerjee's book, in the sense of finally providing readers with late twentieth-century critical work of solid philosophical, scholarly value, especially given that Seamus Heaney's incandescent essay - "Place, Pastness, Poems: A Triptych" (pp. 221-233, reprinted from Salmagundi, 1986) - immediately follows with its beguiling rhapsodic prose. There is a sense of pure wonder in this mature poet's love of Hardy - as if enthralled with some rare secret unfolding before his eyes. Heaney provides a welcome antidote to some of the earlier ills of this book. Next, by contrast, Dennis Taylor's "Hardy and Wordsworth" (pp. 234-252, reprinted from VP, 1986) presents a dry-eyed, succinct account of Wordsworth's influence on Hardy. However, erudite as Taylor always is, I am surprised at this choice of reprint on Banerjee's part when Taylor's far more important and up-to-the-minute "The Chronology of Hardy's Poetry: Part I" had already appeared in print during the preparation of Historical Evaluation (VP, 1999). The same complaint of inept editorial choice might also be levelled at the next selected reprint. This is J. Hillis Miller's contribution to the book which surely represents one of his more meandering moments - his notions of topography and tropography in Hardy's poem "In Front of the Landscape" bear little of his customary astute imprint (pp. 253-274, reprinted from Post-Structuralist Readings of English Poetry, 1987). This slightly drifting essay seems an odd choice, on Banerjee's part, given that Hillis Miller still stands among the most eminent of Hardy critics for his Thomas Hardy: Distance and Desire (1970). If this were excerpted here it would place him, chronologically speaking, a decade earlier in this Historical Evaluation but would surely place him more learnedly and more accurately in terms of his literary power, cultural influence and, of course, his historical importance within the Hardyan literary canon. Thus, as luck (or poor research) would have it, this momentary splendor, notably at the hands of Hoffpauir and Heaney, is short-lived. Mediocrity now openly reappears on the scene with M. L. Rosenthal's "Hardy's Satires: Hard Knowledge, Ghostly Presence, Sexual Loss" (pp. 275-285, reprinted from Southern Review, 1991 ), which provides some rather obvious glosses on a handful of poems; this is followed by a piece by Robert Langbaum in which he returns to the hoary Apologia style of some of his reactionary predecessors (pp. 286-302, reprinted from VP, 1992), and whereas U.C Knoepflmacher does pick up the pace with his</page><page sequence="49">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 461 marvellously inventive "Hardy's Ruins: Female Spaces and Male Designs" (pp. 303-333) which, incidentally, also proved to be by far the best thing among the essays in The Sense of Sex: Feminist Perspectives on Hardy (1993), edited by Margaret Higgonnet, in which it was originally published, Dan Jacobson throws all of that to the winds in "Thomas Hardy: the Poet as Philosopher (pp. 334-345, reprinted from The American Scholar, 1996). Here we go back, yet again, ad nauseam, to the hackneyed litany of epithets: Hardy and "Pessimism. Gloom. Melancholy. Fate. Meaninglessness" (p. 334) and worse: as Jacobson struggles with an understanding of philosophy and fails, in turn, to produce a coherent argument in support of Hardy as "genuinely philosophical as well" (pp. 336-345), so he confuses meaning - "childlike" does not mean the same thing as "childish," innocence and wonder are not the same as simple- mindedness and naivety. Not a promising start. Unfortunately, it then comes as no surprise at all when the basis of Jacobson's "philosophical" investigations rests with one axiom from Schopenhauer (on the misery of human existence - no documented source) and one aphorism from Wittgenstein - "If a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand it" (again, no documentation). I seem to remember that in my earliest school studies of Hardy-and-philosophy the names Hegel, J. S. Mill, Fourier, Pater, Nietzsche, Comte, Carlyle, Huxley, Spencer, et al. came into it somewhere. Samuel Hynes, on "How to be an Old Poet: The Examples of Hardy and Yeats" (pp. 346-364, reprinted from Sewanee Review, 1997), almost redeems the last section of Banerjee's book with excellent good humor and a fine, vigorous, critical casting of "flames upon the night" ("Two Songs From a Play") - reliving, it seems, in his own old age, the lines of these two great poets - one of which leaves Hardy with the question: "To see pretty girls and think of death how old must man be?" ("The High- School Lawn"). Would that Historical Evaluation knew not only how to research and select the finest critical works of the twentieth century for the one single compendium of this kind to be published in the millennium year, but also how to bring the curtain down on them with flourish and style. The Hynes would have been most apt. The tone is lively, never for a single moment condescending, as seems to be the trend in this selection; the insights are thought-provoking, the verse-choices are singularly appropriate, and the textual-analysis rigorous. Unfortunately, as it is, the book's last words are given to Joseph Brodsky's "Wooing the Inanimate" (reprinted from On Grief and Reason, 1998) - wonderful title, dismal reading! Brodsky's way of skewing things is not endearing. Hardy's father, we are told, "could not afford to support him in a scholarly career, apprenticing him instead to a local church architect" (p. 365). This is</page><page sequence="50">462 / VICTORIAN POETRY misleading. Not only was Hardy's father a "ready-money man" (Florence Emily Hardy, The Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840-1928 [London: Macmillan, 1962], p. 27; hereafter Life) who, in fact, offered to pay down the whole of the three-year tuition premium at the beginning of the first term to Hicks, the architect, but the latter had originally had a Bristol practice - not altogether the small-time "local church-architect" Brodsky would wish upon us. Odd too, that sage writers such as Thackeray, Meredith, J. S. Mill, Carlyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, Darwin, Swinburne, Hopkins, Pater, and more should be singled out as having no influence on Hardy's thinking specifically, Brodsky claims, when he was setting out to write "The Darkling Thrush." How on earth does Brodsky know this? Why insinuate an idea if it cannot be supported? Isn't this what we discourage in students in their basic writing courses? But this, in itself, is trivial. What is irremediably disconcerting are Brodsky 's assumptions in general, one of them being that he has to "sell" Hardy: (4th paragraph): "So why push him on us? You may ask." (9th paragraph): "So why push him on you, you may persist." (12th paragraph): "I push him on you" This "salesman" role may suffice for the high-school classroom and possi- bly sits well enough with Brodsky 's repeated references to Hardy's "bloody - mindedness," but it irks this particular reader who has not taken up this collection of essays out of an antipathy for Hardy. Thus An Historical Evaluation of Thomas Hardy's Poetry, edited by A. Banerjee, ends as it begins, provoking a most undesirable readerly dis- trust - unfortunate in Brodsky 's case where many of his forays into Hardy's poetry are strikingly adventurous. I say "as it begins" because, unluckily for readers in need of a compendium of this nature, the writer of the Preface to the book, Robert Fraser, is also prone to distorting the facts about Hardy. He tells us, for example, that "Hardy's verse remained qui- etly respectable in the years between the world wars" (p. xiv). A quick reading of Hardy's Apology to Late Lyrics (published in 1922) would have soon put Fraser wise, as would a glimpse at the Life - at say, the debacle over the press report of Alfred Noyes's denunciation, in a public lecture, of Hardy's philosophy - purportedly, that "the Power behind the Uni- verse was an imbecile jester" (Life, p. 408). Poor Hardy. He had consid- ered Noyes a friend. But I believe the matter was cleared up - it had been yet another example of careless reportage - whereas those who had been repelled by Moments of Vision in 1918 or such poems as "The Wood Fire" and "The Collector Cleans His Picture" were not so easily forgotten. But before we leave Fraser's Preface, in which he emphasizes that a mania for</page><page sequence="51">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 463 Housman had seized the British who "hiked all around Europe" with A Shropshire Lad "in the knapsacks of young intellectuals" (p. xiv), but that Hardy was never so acclaimed by the war generation (he conveniently forgets that Sassoon, for one, carried Tess into the trenches), the greatest irony is that Fraser not only skews the evidence but actually reverses it- Hardy, he says, seems to "express no emotion other than his own, with which the reader must make an effort to empathise" (p. xv). Is this just simple oversight? (all those voices, all those dramatic monologues, all those diverse speakers!), or is it (as I suspect, given Fraser's other errors) a misremembering of Hardy's own dictum that a poet should record the thought of his own time and the emotion of all the ages? For the hapless many who rely on print publications to fuel and support their interest in Hardy's poetry the outlook seems bleak. Barbara Hardy has recently brought out a book entitled Thomas Hardy: Imagining Imagination in Hardy's Poetry and Fiction (London and New Brunswick: Athlone Press, 2000). However, as with Historical Evaluation, most chap- ters in this book derive from previously published articles and even then the portions devoted to poetry are scant. Other millennium book publi- cations of a literary critical nature (excluding biographies, books with sig- nificant Hardy content, and publications of the Notes and Reader's Guide variety) include Tim Armstrong's Haunted Hardy: Poetry, History, Memory (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2000). This interestingly looks at Hardy's poetry in the light of ghostly manifestations, memories, aspects of childhood, death, and mourning but it has the drawback of reading like a collection of lecture notes. There are headings and subheadings and a sense of dis- continuity and fragmentation as if the book were designed for the learn- ing-impaired in need of special consideration of their short attention span. We might notice in passing Shanta Dutta's Ambivalence in Hardy : A Study of His Attitude to Women (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000), which is devoted entirely to fiction and biography, and Michael Irwin's Reading Hardy's Landscapes (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000), which has no sub- stantial poetry sections. If we are to privilege Banerjee's book as a full book-length publica- tion when it is in fact, despite the title of An Historial Evaluation of Tho- mas Hardy's Poetry, a collection of essays, this privilege should also be extended to other compilations of this kind. None is devoted entirely to poetry, however. Richard Nemesvari and Rosemarie Morgan's Festschrift edition, Human Shows: Essays in Honour of Michael Millgate (New Haven: Hardy Association Press, 2000), aptly focusses upon items biographical and political, and Rosemarie Morgan's Festschrift edition, Days to Recol- lect: Essays in Honour of Robert Schweik (New Haven: Hardy Association Press, 2000), brings into print publication the special contributions of</page><page sequence="52">464 / VICTORIAN POETRY members of the Thomas Hardy Association written specifically for, and dedicated to, Robert Schweik, to illustrate the influence of this fine scholar upon modern scholarship. The poetry content of this book is provided not by Hardy but by William W. Morgan and Sumiko Inoue who submit their own verses in honor of the book's title-holder, Robert Schweik. On the other hand, The Achievement of Thomas Hardy, edited by Phillip Mallett (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000), does feature four fine essays on Hardy's poetry: William Morgan's, "'As near to poetry ... as the conditions would allow': The Presence of the Poet in Hardy's Novels" (pp. 72-94), discusses Hardy's infusion of poetry in the prose works, as also in his dictated biog- raphy; James Gibson's piece on "Wessex Poems, 1898" (pp. 105-1 16) specu- lates on Hardy's (occasionally odd) choices for Wessex Poems, his first published volume of verses; Danny Karlin's "The Figure of the Singer in the Poetry of Thomas Hardy" (pp. 117-136) looks at generic aspects of poetry as song, and Douglas Dunn, in "Thomas Hardy's Narrative Art: The Poems and Short Stories" (pp. 137-154) draws parallels between these two art forms and their relation to oral tradition.The fact of the matter is that there is probably more value in these four original essays - as repre- senting current thought, current investigation, current priorities - than in the bulk of the Banerjee book, given that the latter relies wholly on reprinted essays. In a league of its own, The Oxford Reader's Companion to Hardy, edited by Norman Page (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2000), fea- turing a vast and comprehensive collection of essays signed by an interna- tional team of forty-two scholar-specialists, clearly stands supreme among millennium publications on Hardy, but it does remain a reference book, encyclopedic in scope, and out of range for most modest pockets. The best news I have reserved for the last, and it is this: if book- length publications on Hardy's poetry have failed, this past year, to fill the ever-growing need for modern scholarly studies on his verse, where there is a plethora of fine work on his fiction, the electronic media has more than compensated for this. The Poetry of Thomas Hardy: A Multimedia CD- ROM, edited by Sara Haslam (S.J.Haslam@open.ac.uk) and Glyn Turton (Chester: Chester College of Higher Education, 2001), is a superbly com- prehensive resource. It not only features the text of The Complete Poems of Thomas Hardy, edited by James Gibson, but also contains audio material including poetry readings, essays, interviews, biographical and historical items while, for students, a special section is devoted to portfolio con- struction, topic selection, and print functions for the poems. If we begin with this splendid compilation and move on to the Thomas Hardy Association's (TTHA; www.yale.edu/hardysoc) online resources, freely available to all comers, there is no doubt that the world of poetry lovers - students, scholars, common readers - have enough at their fingertips to</page><page sequence="53">ROSEMARIE MORGAN / 465 satisfy their every "Hardyan" urge. Discussion groups on TTHA's "Forum" (www.yale.edu/hardysoc/Welcome/Forum) have, quite spontaneously, gen- erated debates - called threads - on topics as various as film adaptations of Hardy's work to suspected plagiarism to tottering tombstones and, of course, poetry. More specifically, TTHA's "Poetry" page, with its innova- tive Poem-of-the-Month (POTM) series (www.yale.edu/hardysoc/poetry/ poetry.htm), opens at the beginning of each month with a newly posted poem of Hardy's together with a comprehensive introduction by William W. Morgan. Messages and replies for the year 2001 posted on the POTM have featured the following poems: "She At His Funeral," "Her Confes- sion," "Tess's Lament," "The Pine Planters," "The Pink Frock," "The Beauty," "I Rose and Went to Rou'tor Town," "An Upbraiding," "The Chapel- Organist," "A Sunday Morning Tragedy," "The Tramp-Woman's Tragedy," "The Last Signal," "Rome at the Pyramid of Cestius Near the Graves of Shelley and Keats," and "Shelley's Skylark." The Hardy Association's extraordinary achievement in providing these unique services to anyone who chooses to visit its website - an achievement which relies solely on the support of its worldwide body of twenty-one scholar-directors, each a teaching professor and Hardy ex- pert - is made manifest in the book publications produced by TTHA on a regular basis, and by the group as a whole. Relying, for much of its book content, on the "Forum" and POTM debates, the annual Hardy Review, now into its fourth volume, includes selected threads from both discus- sion groups which are carefully edited so as to read fluently and conversa- tionally. In this manner, students from as far afield as Canberra (now, by virtue of email, no longer "far"), and professors from Nova Scotia to Ab- erdeen to Dorset to Calcutta or Tokyo engage in mutually rewarding de- bates on issues as broad as teaching techniques and as narrow as the meaning of "hagrid." Editing Hardy, Occasional Series, Vol. 1, edited by Rosemarie Morgan (New Haven: The Hardy Association Press, 1999), was the first TTHA publication to focus upon a single discussion thread, in this in- stance a debate by editors of Hardy's works from across the world and from publishing houses small and large, on the relative merits and demerits of certain editions and certain editorial practices. Volume 2 in the Occa- sional Series, entitled Thomas Hardy's Emma Poems, edited by Rosemarie Morgan and William W. Morgan (New Haven: The Hardy Association Press, 2001), brings into print publication discussions from the POTM in 2000 on thirteen of Hardy's poems written immediately following Emma's death: namely, "The Going," "The Voice," "The Phantom Horsewoman," "Under the Waterfall," "The Shadow on the Stone," "During Wind and Rain," "Beeny Cliff," "The Haunter," "His Visitor," "The Spell of the Rose," "Where the Picnic Was," and "If You Had Known."</page><page sequence="54">466 / VICTORIAN POETRY A variety of other exceptionally fine Hardy-related activities take place on the internet - too many to report on here. Of special mention are the sites devoted to musical settings to Hardy's poems - again, a unique feature of the electronic age which permits visitors to listen to snippets of composers' works. Of note here, in the Hardyan context, is composer Roy Buckle's website: www.segr-music.net. This offers a variety of musical set- tings of Hardy's poems together with images - as with the poem/song "Once at Swanage" where both poem and setting are enhanced by pictorial ef- fects. Hence, it is the case that the sore lack of literary scholarship in full- length book publication is amply compensated for by the wealth of good things on the internet - and I have only scratched the surface. Better things are yet to come! Hopkins JEFFREY B. LOOMIS As Valentine Cunningham emphasizes the need for both "Fact and Tact," in a January 2001 article of that title (EIC 51, no. 1: 119-138), he generally supports my contentions, in this column last year, that literary criticism needs continuous logical control, even in our "postmodernized" millennium. In eight pages that summarize much previous study concern- ing Hopkins' sonnet "Felix Randal," Cunningham shows how etymologi- cal and historical research has often provided valid "fact[ual]" contribu- tions to our understanding of this particular Hopkins lyric. He simulta- neously censures illogical critics, who often sloppily concoct "weird mistakings and strange constructions" of poems that they examine (p. 133). Such critical misadventurers, opines Cunningham, produce "fail- ures with fact" that are also "clear failures of tact," "trampl[ing] all over the poem" (p. 134). Cunningham is not ultimately a reactionary curmudgeon, for he does acknowledge value in diverse critical methodologies. Still, he warns that "[o]ur undismayed current access to the facts about Hopkins' fraught sexuality," like "our inevitably widening knowledge about how texts work and what they do," "makes critical sensitivity, the principledness of tact- ful handling of texts, all the more necessary than ever" (pp. 136-137). Multiple recent "postmodern" discussions of Hopkins, featured in several consecutive issues of VP, might please or displease Cunningham. I myself find that the articles vary considerably in the amount of fact and tact they display. They do demonstrate the potential value in postmodernist criticism - but show some disconcertingly cavalier analysis as well.</page><page sequence="55">JEFFREY B. LOOMIS / 467 The first publication, Jenny Holt's "The Negotiation of Power Rela- tions in Gerard Manley Hopkins' 'The Wreck of the Deutschland' and Sonnets about Working-Class Men" (VP 38 [2000]: 299-318), seems to begin sensibly enough, with probing of the ambiguous lexicon in "Felix Randal." Noting that Hopkins wrote about how he as a priest "tendered" a "ransom" to the dying Felix, Holt claims that these words partly reveal Hopkins as a corporate manipulator: someone who cared less for suffering people than for the Roman Catholic Church's institutional agendas (p. 301). Perhaps as a limited counterargument to excessive hagiographies of Hopkins, Holt may have a point. Yet her version of Hopkins seems overly anxious to erase all memories of a genial "tender [ness]" long associ- ated with him. Granted, an all-gentle Hopkins must, at least to some degree, be a narrow stereotype. Yet Holt generally views Hopkins according to a different stereotype, one deeming all religion manipulative and silly. Holt appears (pp. 301, 307-308) to judge Hopkins daft for having felt certain familiar religious paradoxes to be experientially conceivable - for instance, the mixing of human free will in an inexplicable ideational surd with divine predestination, or the meshing of perceived divine grace with conceived divine law. She insists, instead, that it is a folly for Hopkins ever to have sensed what he expressed in the "Deutschland" ode: the notion that God's mysterious interventions in earthly life can feel both like a "proffer [ing]" and like a "pressure" (p. 308). Likewise, she apparently believes, Hopkins should not have met Felix Randal's temperamental outbursts, during the blacksmith's battle against multiple fatal illnesses, with both priestly u[r]eprieve" and priestly "reproof (p. 301). For the sake of constantly "trace"-ing new readings that deconstruct traditional ones, therefore, Holt too often does distort fact and tact. I do not deny potential partial insight in such of her observations as the dec- laration that Hopkins may "fetishize" working men characters in a "gaze" which precludes much true "interact [ion]" with them (p. 303). But it does seem farfetched to assert, as Holt does (p. 304), that, when Hopkins eliminates part of the content of 1 Peter 1.24 from his allusion to that Bible verse in "The Wreck of the Deutschland," he does so in order delib- erately to protest against the idea of God's ultimate "dominance" over words. Holt seems regularly to conjure forth thin circumstantial evi- dence for viewing Hopkins' entire life as a prooftext for "unreliable] . . . textuality" (p. 313). She somberly, for example, notes that he "deferred responsibility for his own life onto the Jesuits," "abdicated liability for his writing by burning his early works," and "ceded even the act of praying to [the tall "Deutschland" nun] a third party" (p. 313). In all these supposed factual illustrations, Holt appears to twist the</page><page sequence="56">468 I VICTORIAN POETRY givens of Hopkins' biography into flimsy support for deconstructionist language theory. Additionally, and unfortunately like many others (e.g., Kerry McSweeney, in his recent "Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Use of Poetry," ELN 37, no. 3 [March 2000]: 56-62), Holt wrongly generalizes, from Hopkins' sermonic condemnation of Satan's preening aesthetic strut, that Hopkins vilified all aesthetic practice, including his own. I actually find myself responding less negatively than I might have expected toward Paul G. Beidler's essay "Chiastic Strands in Stanza 1 of The Wreck of the Deutschland'" (VP 38 [2000]: 579-595). This is true even though Beidler's writing is far denser with Derridean jargon than is Holt's - and even though Beidler never really convinces me, for instance, that Stanza 1 in the "Deutschland" ode clearly figures "a whaling scene," with definite links to the tales of Job and Jonah (pp. 583-584, 588-590). Indeed, Beidler presents his case for such comparisons with too much apparent authoritarianism. We thus may become confused, not perceiv- ing that his primary goal is puissant playfulness. Beidler is clever, though, and his analysis of "Deutschland'"s Stanza 1, with its lexical ambiguity and structural blend of chiasmus and parallelism, does look much more steadily anxious to establish textual fact, albeit deconstructive fact, than is Jenny Holt's foray into factual distortion. Ultimately, however, Beidler is at least somewhat like Holt - for he does want the literary text to serve deconstructionist ideology like a slave. He is markedly fervent about proving that "there is no truth, no communication, without arbitrary interpretation of ... meaning" (p. 593). Similarly, Simon Humphries' "'All By Turn and Turn About': The Indeterminacy of Hopkins' 'Epithalamion'" (VP 38 [2000]: 343-363) firmly announces its deconstructionist passion for examining semantic "insta- bility" (p. 355). Humphries has actually chosen a rather obvious text to "deconstruct" - for Hopkins himself evidently always believed "Epithalamion" a mere self-contradictory fragment. Yet Humphries' herme- neutic work, one must admit, is quite skilled and quite fair-minded. He also uncovers potential, and plausible, intertextual links between "Epithalamion" and two historically antecedent poems: Wordsworth's "Nutting" and Catullus' "#61." From time to time, on the other hand, Humphries may himself read literature with narrow psychologism. For instance, his essay's final words represent Hopkins' ardor for Christ only as "the context in which his homoerotic imagination would least trouble him" (p. 360). Yet Humphries does, in general, put into regular practice the adage he declares at a key turning point in his discussion: the contention that Hopkins' "religious convictions have to be taken seriously, however difficult (or uncongenial) the critic finds that [fact]" (p. 345).</page><page sequence="57">JEFFREY B. LOOMIS / 469 Dennis Sobolev, in his article "Hopkins, Language, Meaning" (VN 98 [Fall 2000]: 1144), does not reveal any particular deconstructionist agenda. He does, though, wish to contend that Hopkins truly still fore- casts "twentieth-century poetry" - a view that we might all more readily share if we all were to question the "assumption" that he held a "naive 'Cratylian' belief in the immanence of meaning in the formal properties of language" (p. 11)- Sobolev, like Humphries, is admirably thorough, and his careful combing through Hopkins' still-extant writings seems correctly to locate "no real evidence" for Hopkins' ever having held a firm belief in onomatopoeic linguistic idealism (p. 11). As Sobolev stipulates, "Hopkins wrote [about onomatopoeia] at the age of nineteen; and except for a brief reference a bit later (J 7), never before and never after does Hopkins mention onomatopoeia; never does he try to give it a 'fair chance'" (p. 12). A reverence for plentiful textual evidence fortunately characterizes not only Humphries and Sobolev, but also Frederick Buechner, in the sensitive Hopkins chapter which leads off his book Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought To Say): Reflections on Literature and Faith (Harper San Francisco, 2001). It is true that Buechner apparently has an ultimate purpose not of pure literary criticism, but instead of testifying to the therapeutic power, for readers, of encounters with authors who dare to write from out of the tensions created by their deepest spiritual struggles. Yet Buechner demonstrates a very honest, a very multi-faceted interest in Hopkins. Thus he can admire the Jesuit's religious faith even as he also can calmly consider the priest's likely sexual tensions. Because Buechner seems both keenly insightful and extremely lucid, I found his book's other three chapters (on Twain, Chesterton, and Shakespeare) of equal power with his essay concerning Hopkins. Another recent critic, Christiane Lang-Graumann, delights one by providing, with much fact and tact, a very skilled and microscopically thorough reading of an often oversimply interpreted Hopkins lyric. Like the similar poem "Ribblesdale," which draws the brief attention of Neville Newman in Expl 57, no. 4 (Summer 1999): 214-215, Hopkins' "Binsey Poplars" has seemed merely to reveal Hopkins in the role of ecologist, and to show his ever-earnest poetic persona voicing an especially tender dis- position toward nature. Lang-Graumann, however, in "Gerard Manley Hopkins Revisiting Binsey" (Connotations 8, no. 1 [1998/99]: 48-62), care- fully delineates how the poem makes possible for Hopkins "two revisitings . . . simultaneously": "one real in an autobiographical sense, facing the mutilated landscape, and another one imaginary, returning to the scene in memory" (p. 51). She also deftly illustrates how such diverse intellec- tual influences as Duns Scotus, John Ruskin, Ovid, Shakespeare, and</page><page sequence="58">470 / VICTORIAN POETRY Coleridge contribute to the rich lacings of underthought in this poem - which proves, according to Lang-Graumann's analysis, rather richly mytho- logical While Lang-Graumann skillfully investigates substrata in a single Hopkins lyric, Raymond J. Ventre ably applies reader- response study to a Hopkins poem sequence- In "The Body Racked with Pain: Hopkins' Dark Sonnets" (ANQ 13, no. 4 [Fall 2000]: 3746), Ventre compares his own soundings and sightings, while facing a period of severe illness, with Hopkins' descriptions in the renowned 1885 cycle of "terror- inspired" sonnets. From what he knows about Hopkins' far-from-perfect bodily health during the era which produced these roughhewn works, Ventre surmises that the sonnets "might very well have emanated" from the reli- gious poet's struggles with personal "physical pain" (p. 39). Those sonnets also, of course, arose from Hopkins' meditative poetics and unique spiritual vision. He was much like Georges Seurat, his French painter contemporary, in having what Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, in Sunday in the Park with George (Applause Books, 1984), call a "mission" "to see," in ever- new ways (p. 85). Many recent studies of Hopkins focus upon the Jesuit scribe's obsession with seeing. Even a basically biographical record, like Tom Zaniello's "Alpine Art and Science: Hopkins' Swiss Adventure" (HQ 27, no. 1-2 [Winter- Spring 2000]: 3-15), demonstrates how Hopkins attempted fervently, along with his mentor John Ruskin, whom Zaniello is here quoting (p. 3), to "cultivate] . . . the instrument of sight." Paradoxically, though, the young Hopkins' sight, when he went vacationing to the Alps in 1868, began to question Ruskin's earlier sight and insight. Hopkins became convinced that glaciers were not "viscous," as Ruskin thought them. Instead, to Hopkins, they now appeared phenomena which, as scientist John Tyndall hypothesized, formed themselves through "regelation," "crack[ing] under pressure and then freezing] again" (p. 8). Examining Hopkins' special sight (and insight) from her perspec- tive as a theorist of poetry's ontological nature, Jane Hirshfield proclaims, in "Kingfishers Catching Fire: Seeing with Poetry's Eyes" (APR [January/ February 2000]: 9-12), that any poet's "eye must learn to abandon its long habit of useful serving and take up instead an active delight in its own ends" (p. 9). Yet a poet, especially one as rich as Hopkins, also practices, Hirshfield astutely declares, "seeing-through-language," "test[ed] and confirmed] in the realm of things" after "the moment of writing" causes "the eyes of ordinary seeing [to] close down . . . [while] the poem rushes into the world on a mysterious inner impulsion" (p. 9). Therefore, Hirshfield believes that "writing poems ... is fundamentally a contempla- tive practice," one which helps "the mind . . . [to] extend itself into the</page><page sequence="59">JEFFREY B. LOOM1S 1 471 realm of the other" - and, over time, to refine, like Hopkins, a "gaze of steady intention" (p. 10). Leo Truchlar, in one essay (pp. 51-70) of his book Uber Literatur und andere Kunste: 12 Versuche (Vienna: Bohlau, 2000), attributes (pp. 62-63) a quasi-mystical mode of seeing even to the nature journals that Hopkins wrote while in his twenties: "intensives Sehen, . . . nicht mehr eine bios abbildungsorientierte Wahrnehmungspraxis" but, instead, "[e]ine . . . visuelle Annaherung an das Sein, . . . ein der My stik nicht unahnliches synasthetisches Schauen" Even as he labels (p. 60) Hopkins' written responses to nature "detailfreudig" and "fast ekstatisch" Truchlar finds their near-ecstasy to sum- mon forth "eine Stimme" which stretches beyond passion and is suspi- cious of sentiment (p. 65). Hopkins he judges (at least in general) to have been "nicht narzisstisch"(p. 69) - especially as he strove to demonstrate sci- entific precision, in "detail- intensive, fast wissenschaftlich anmutende Inventarisieren der Aussenwelt, mitunter auch der Innerwelt" (pp. 58-59). However, neither as quasi-mysticism nor as quasi-science does Hopkins' nature description, at least in Truchlar's opinion, escape vulnerability to our general human tremors over mortality - as it surely does not in the example with which Truchlar ends his study (p. 69): Hopkins' April 8, 1873 observation of an ash tree slaughtered for its timber. Truchlar, be- sides, does at one point skeptically ask (p. 66), "1st es fur den Journal- und Tagebuchschreiber uberhaupt moglich, die Vielfalt der Wirklichkeit durch eine Kunstform zu bandigenl" R. J. C. Watt does not focus at all on any sort of mystical gaze in Hopkins' modes of seeing. Instead, he applies (albeit gently) some Lacanian theories of the psychosexual "gaze" to examining such matters as Hopkins' perhaps-sometimes-almost-fetishistic fascination with human feet and shoes. Watt's treatment of "Hopkins and the Gothic Body," in Victorian Gothic: Literary and Cultural Manifestations in the Nineteenth Century, ed. Ruth Robbins and Julian Wolfreys (New York: Palgrave, 2000): 60-89, asserts that "as the gothic novel ceased to be a genre in itself, many of its elements came to pervade other genres" (p. 63). This ideational spillage may affect Hopkins' somewhat "gothicized" quaintness of language (p. 66) and his fascination with scenes of "dismemberment" (p. 69). It also af- fects, speculates Watt, Hopkins' concern about "the body-language of shame or despair" (p. 74) and his attention to separated "part[s] of the body" - as manifested, especially, in the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus which he shared with other late nineteenth-century Roman Catholics (pp. 70-71). Watt somewhat shares Jenny Holt's, Simon Humphries', Julia Saville's, even Frederick Buechner's recent zeal for discussing Hopkins' reputed homoeroticism. Thus Watt spends a great deal of his essay argu-</page><page sequence="60">472 I VICTORIAN POETRY ing that Hopkins "overcomes the difficulty he feels in encountering the working-class male body by a double strategy: an employment of stereo- type, and a focus on feet" (p. 76). However, whether or not Watt's psychobiographical approach appeals to one, he still appears original in his choice of examples, fairly persuasive as he marshals his evidence, and a generally wise and effective writer: one neither vituperatively polemical nor jargonistic. Harsher examiners than I might find even Hopkins himself some- times too jargonistic. In any case, his writing style is eccentric, and new commentaries on his style thus continue to emerge regularly. In Etudes 391, no. 1 (juillet-aout 1999): 124-126, Claude Dandrea evaluates Jean Mambrino's recently expanded French translation of Hopkins. We also hear from R.J.C. Watt on stylistic matters, as he writes of "Editorial Mumpsimus in the Poems of Gerard Hopkins" (Library 21, no. 4 [Decem- ber 1999]: 361-368). Watt trenchantly queries what he finds often-cen- surable editors' choices concerning variants they have printed of standard Hopkins texts. Musician Christopher R. Wilson, in "Nineteenth-Century Musical Agogics as an Element in Gerard Manley Hopkins's Prosody" (CL 52, no. 1 [Winter 2000]: 72-86), quotes (p. 83) John Hollander, with whom he agrees that Hopkins' "new type of metrical contract" yields its "commit- ment . . . not to convention, but to the poetic self." While conscious about not driving analogies too resolutely (p. 84), Wilson contends that "nineteenth-century musical agogics - that is, ... the widespread use of rubato, rhythmic flexibility, pauses, and accents that is characteristic of [usually quite expressive] Romantic music" (p. 13), does bear affinity with Hopkins' metrical innovations - so that, for instance, what Hopkins called metrical "outrides" are like "rubato, followed by an expressive hesitation, a distinctive mannerism of Romantic interpretation, equivalent to the Luftpause or 'breath-pause'" (p. 83). As both an avocational singer and a vocational literary scholar, I must say that Wilson's comparisons between musical practice and Hopkins' metrics give at least me a helpful added reference point for understanding Hopkins' sprung rhythm. As a reader simultaneously in love with song, I was at first drawn to Hopkins because I enjoyed solving such aesthetic puzzles as those his sprung-rhythmed poems provide. I cannot help but concur, therefore, with the recent judgments of Donald Justice, inscribed in "Benign Obscu- rity," one essay featured in Sewanee Writers on Writing, ed. Wyatt Prunty (Louisiana State Univ. Press, 2000), pp. 105-116. While acknowledging that "obscurity in itself can hardly guarantee importance and seriousness to a poem," Justice maintains that "poetry that is difficult," like Hopkins', "engages more of the whole being" than does other verse (p. 107). He adds</page><page sequence="61">JEFFREY B. LOOMIS I 473 (p. 108) that, with Hopkins' work, "the beauty of the text" delays one's desire for explication, as one enjoys the "rich helping of language" and discovers (p. Ill) "the excitement of being in beyond one's depth/' "[S]tyle," Justice further contends, "can slide over into content and nudge it out of the way" - thus producing a temporarily acceptable slowdown in the herme- neutic process (p. 108). However, Justice, as a poet who is also a critic, does not reject deeper exegetical analysis - although he concludes (p. 110) that Hopkins' "Spelt with Sybil's Leaves" may have "as much theology in it as ... human feeling, but what comes across is the human feeling." Some worthy topics for Hopkins research do not involve particular attention to either "theology" or "human feeling." For instance, the key Hopkinsian journal HQ devoted one full recent issue (27, nos. 3-4 [Sum- mer-Fall 2000]) to the scholarship of Fredric W. Schlatter, S.J., which capably discussed Hopkins' textual notes and professorial methodologies, employed while the Jesuit poet-professor taught works by Cicero and Lucan. On the other hand, in the other most recent issue (27, nos. 1-2 [Winter- Spring 2000]) of their quarterly, the HQ editors have combined (along with the already cited Tom Zaniello essay on Hopkins and Switzer- land) one article focused on theology ("'World-Mothering Air': The Vir- gin Mary as Poetic Image," by Leo M. Manglaviti, S.J., pp. 44-53) and John J. Stinson's article (pp. 18-43) on Hopkins' human feeling - espe- cially as that feeling made a historically much-later and much-different writer, Anthony Burgess, nonetheless feel affinity with the nineteenth- century Jesuit. Both articles, albeit not very similar in their evident origi- nating motivations or conclusions, offer cogent and enlightening infor- mation. Back in 1994, when I reviewed in this column Guiseppe Serpillo's 1993 HA article on Hopkins' quest for poetic silence, I found that Serpillo "meaningfully humanize[d] our understanding" of Hopkins (VP 32 [1994]: 482). I still believe that Serpillo achieves such an admirably humanistic goal, as he includes one new and several previously published discussions of Hopkins in the handsomely bound book Kingfishers: Essays on Irish and English Poetry (Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland: Goldsmith Press, 2001). Still, although I did not voice such reservations in 1994, 1 would today, by contrast, question Serpillo's tendency to overstate Hopkins' doubts about the value of poetry writing. For instance, the Sardinian critic claims (p. 33) that "the struggle to mould and master [language] becomes by analogy a struggle [for Hopkins] against the First Creator of the matter itself." The words which Serpillo earlier quoted from Alberto Moravia (p. 15) to me seem much better to define what happened when Hopkins composed poetic artifacts (and, indeed, Moravia's words also seem to echo Jane Hirshfield's earlier-cited recent APR credoes about the poetic task):</page><page sequence="62">474 I VICTORIAN POETRY '"writing' ... is not 'transcribing our own ideas', but 'allowing the written text to tell us the truth about them.'" Hopkins' Ignatian- inspired medi- tative writing did tell him "the truth" about his "ideas," as well as the truths about his imagings (compositions of place) and also about his prayer- ful colloquies with God. So I do not think that he ever very completely deemed his artistic work inimical to his faith - even though I concur with Serpillo (p. 15) that Hopkins, no complete mystic, did experience only "intermittent perception" of the Divine, however much "intensity" dwelt within that "intermittent perception." In the one new essay placed within Serpillo's Kingfishers tome ("In Parenthesis: Hints of Truth from behind the Curtains" [pp. 63-76]), Serpillo chiefly highlights, as in his earlier writings, his sensings of who the man Hopkins was. He judges Hopkins (p. 74) to have been "a liminal figure all his life," a man who "had frequent glimpses of truth but . . . [whose] soul was charged to the end with some weight (intellectual, social, psychologi- cal) which kept dragging him away from permanent bliss." However, Serpillo once again also becomes, in this fourteen-page discussion of pa- rentheses, as intrigued with Hopkins' style as he was in his earlier, and now-here-republished, Hopkinsian pieces. One of these concerns Hopkins' poetic techniques of "ellipsis" and "aposiopesis" (pp. 23-27), a second treats the Jesuit bard's vital use of similes (pp. 49-62), and the third essay re- counts struggles translators have when they try to transmit, into different languages, the nuances of Hopkins' verbal palette (pp. 37-48). The new "In Parenthesis" essay examines keenly Hopkins' use of parentheses to voice the recurrent ontological doubts Hopkins felt, despite his generally affirmed faith (p. 65). In the midst of this newly composed essay, Serpillo does make one notable error of fact. He claims, wrongly (p. 73), that "Carrion Comfort" was not one of Hopkins' 1885 "terrible sonnets." He and/or his editors could also have used more blue-pencilling tact, in order to have avoided some markedly weak proofreading of the text. However, Serpillo often eloquently examines the profoundly human Hopkins. That priest and poet - despite his strong "will to believe in God' s promises and to accept his gifts" (p. 65) - did sometimes fear "that human life m[ight] have no sense at all" (p. 65). Therefore, Serpillo (like so many others of us) believes that Hopkins can "show ... us our horror of void" (p. 75) - even as he can also "allow . . . [us] frequent glimpses into" what he still judged "the certitude of permanence" (p. 75).</page><page sequence="63">BENJAMIN F. FISHER / 475 The Poets of the Nineties BENJAMIN E FISHER In the present gathering of materials we confront heterogeneous quality, to say the least. A book that will doubtless draw many readers is Jerusha Hull McCormack's The Man Who Was Dorian Gray (St. Martin's, 2001), a biography of John Gray (1866-1934)- A longtime writer on Gray, McCormack previously published John Gray: Poet, Dandy and Priest ( 1991 ), a far more worthwhile book than the present rewrite, as well as several shorter studies of Gray, plus a selective edition of his prose (1992). Why McCormack chose to rework her original biography into a somewhat ex- panded book wherein documentable events in Gray's life are linked with "fictive" passages is a question that I can not answer, but a suspect produc- tion is the result. Anyone acquainted with Gray biography knows that he deliberately chose to suppress his early identity, as the most decadent of decadent poets during the 1890s, as one who converted from strong Low Church roots to Roman Catholicism, then launched into a season of lapses from that Catholicism, and as the model for Wilde's Dorian Gray. One is not certain whether his entering the priesthood is egg or chicken in such contexts, but once he undertook clerical duties he grew more and more austere as a religious figure. Father, much later Canon, Gray wished to eradicate knowledge about all of his early ventures, attempting to buy up and destroy copies of Silverpoints, that volume of arch-decadent verse which exemplified 1890s bookmaking as an art. Fittingly, this slender volume with ample page margins was published by the Bodley Head, the publish- ing firm so emphatically associated with books that were deemed avant garde in content and form. Gray soon became extremely reticent con- cerning his initial ventures into authorship and his associations with Wilde. Rather curiously in this light, since she "embroiders" repeatedly in creating dramatic scenes from his life, we find McCormack citing or re- peating information about Gray's guardedness concerning any attempts to produce a biography of him, that guardedness being long carried on by surviving members of his family. Moreover, McCormack herself admits her own and, implicitly, oth- ers' limits when Gray biography is in question, and some of the sources she cites repeatedly have long since lost credibility among serious schol- ars. Setting aside any hints of apology in the prefatory comments, one might well go to p. 263, for example, where we read words - which speak volumes - by a longtime friend of Gray, Peter Anson: "Did anyone ever understand John Gray?" I believe that we must respond with a decided</page><page sequence="64">476 / VICTORIAN POETRY "No." At least, we must give a "No" because of several noticeable blanks for which McCormack provides no amplifications or clarifications, and which make the limits of her book the more striking. There is, for ex- ample, only the scantiest of scant documentation extant from the Wilde- Gray, the Sherard-Gray, or the Louys-Gray correspondence (p. 183) - which might prove interesting to 90s specialists. There is the vagueness concerning Gray's travel to Edinburgh in December 1893 (p. 149). There is a miscontextualizing of Ricketts' remark (p. 118), which was not made directly to Gray, as McCormack's presentation implies, and which was made in print years after the event McCormack presents had occurred. There are lacunae in other potentially revelatory bodies of documents (many of them probably destroyed by Gray himself). As to citations from unreliable sources, one may well ask why in the year 2000 we find McCormack drawing upon Frances Winwar's long superseded Oscar Wilde and the Yellow Nineties (1940)? Truth to tell, John Gray's poems, fiction, and essays are far more interesting, or they probably should be, than the selected remains of bio- graphical nature may permit us to know. McCormack's supposed details can exasperate a serious reader. Did Gray really call Raffalovich "Raffy"? Did Gray and Arthur Symons have the verbal interchanges McCormack offers as scenarios? Did some of the other events and conversations take place as we find them "recorded" here? Finally, to stay closer to docu- mented fact, was John Lane, of all publishers, so "hopelessly conserva- tive," in matters of Silverpoints and other Bodley Head publications, as McCormack claims (p. 117)? This is switching the long known roles of Lane and Elkin Mathews, his partner at that time. We certainly have no solid foundations in documentable proof for any of these assertions. And did one of Raffalovich's books actually write itself (see p. 33)? The Man Who Was Dorian Gray reads as if it were a combination of Marie Corelli and below-par George Meredith, with its alternations from sensation- fiction to psychologizing substance. McCormack's own earlier biography and the antecedent books by Brocard Sewell and G. A. Cevasco are far more important contributions to John Gray studies than this latest, even if Sewell's at times veers toward a pedestrian style. Whether Gray's cre- ative writings are so strongly autobiographical as McCormack suggests may also be debated, pace her greater attention to several of his late works than others have paid. Given increasing tendencies in academic circles to depend substantially on what's new, and only that, along with the recent studies of Gray, McCormack's book may be given attention and kudos that it really does not merit, and thus my negativity should be read as a caution. Much more terse, but far more reliable, is Ian Fletcher's "John Henry Gray: His Life, His Poetry," pp. 1-19 in his edition, The Poems of</page><page sequence="65">BENJAMIN F. FISHER 1477 John Gray (1988). With relief one turns to other types of work. Scholarship on A. E. Housman has not been abundant, but HSJ 26 (2000) contains some ex- cellent articles. Of strong biographical scope, Stuart Hopkins' "A. E. Housman's 'De Amicitia'" (pp. 31-42) indicates how this essay, written after AEH's death by his brother, treats AEH's homosexuality. Laurence Housman, also homosexual, was alerted to the great trouble that beset his brother's adult life by a conversation with AEH two years preceding the latter's death and by his reading of AEH's manuscript poems after that decease. Along with Clarence Lindsay, whose commendable essay on AEH's anti-romantic stance I reviewed last year, and Paul Naiditch, Carol Efrati ranks as one of our current foremost AEH scholars. Her three latest HSJ pieces address her subject's gravity, which tended toward an exquisite sense of death's nearness to human life, often as such life may be experienced dynamically. "Housman's Alms of Evening" (pp. 48-54) explicates this theme in several poems, notably ASL XLII, XLVIII, and LX, revealing his minglings of Christian, classical, and nihilist viewpoints on eternity. In "Housman's Guides" (pp. 110-116) she centers on "The Merry Guide" (ASL LXII) and "Hell Gate" (LP XXXI), in which AEH again rejected traditional Christian conceptions of an afterlife, with the second poem possibly hinting that homosexual love frees the pair of escapees from the prison of a Christian hell. Finally, "Housman's Ambiguous Tree" (pp. 89- 96) deftly reviews diverse interpretations of ASL II, the warhorse an- thology poem on the cherry tree, concluding that far more of death may lurk in its theme than has often been discerned. This last article clears away much of the rubbish that has dogged the footsteps of AEH the poet and those of this particular poem. Paul Naiditch's "Max Beerbohm and A. E. Housman" (pp. 97-98) and "Thomas Hardy and A. E. Housman" (pp. 106-109) are packed with important information on these relation- ships. Albeit terse, Naiditch's painstaking scholarship rewards attention, and the second ought especially to serve as a much consulted reference work. Laurence Housman, author (in several genres) and book illustrator who has long remained overshadowed by his better known brother, was, to many, a far more familiar figure in 1890s literary and visual arts circles. Now his important "Pre-Raphaelitism in Art and Poetry," originally a lecture to the Royal Society of Literature, November 13, 1929, published in Essays by Divers Hands, n.s. 12 (1933), is reprinted in JPRS (n.s. 10 [2001]: 9-26). Laurence concludes by emphasizing that although Pre- Raphaelitism, as espoused by its original practitioners, was a passing phase in western culture, its influence lives on in the "evolution both of poetry and of painting" (p. 26). This presentation, coming as it does from a</page><page sequence="66">478 I VICTORIAN POETRY person who was very much involved in 1890s arts movements, which were renowned for their cross-disciplinariness, is a document not to be ignored by those interested in the 90s - which did not end on New Year's Eve 1899 by any means - and having it available in a form more conve- nient than an Essays by Divers Hands series often is should renew interest in its creator and his work. The Eighteen Nineties Society's long history of fostering good work in the era bears fruit once again in its annual Journal for 2000. All four articles have a biographical slant, although biography per se is not the focus in Peter Frost's "A. H. Macmurdo" (pp. 1-7), in which the subject's ventures into publishing, which created books that were artistic in con- tent and format, and which, possibly of greater importance, established the renowned periodical of the era, the Century Guild Hobby Horse, are detailed with admirable concision and precision. A foremost contributor to Macmurdo's periodical occupies Despina Charalambidou-Solomi, whose "Sexual Personae in Ernest Dowson's Love Lyrics" (pp. 27-40) sheds light on that poet's perspective of the beloved female shifting from the asexual innocence in young girls to more somber images of the taint that, for Dowson, inevitably arrives with adult womanhood. Dowson's poems and short stories are read in connection with classical and earlier English lore about femininity, and this article will doubtless occasion responses and call greater attention to his work. The Pre-Raphaelites FLORENCE S. BOOS The past three years have witnessed a resurgence of critical atten- tion to Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Jan Marsh published her fine critical bi- ography Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Painter and Poet in 1999; Jerome McGann and others offered a first installment of their electronic Rossetti archive in 2000 (http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu:1828); and St. John's Col- lege, Cambridge hosted a comprehensive conference on "The Rossettis: Victorian Cosmopolitans in London" in July 2001. McGann has now published Dante Gabriel Rossetti: The Game That Must Be Lost, the most extensive study of Rossetti's poetry since David Riede's Dante Gabriel Rossetti Revisited appeared in 1992. In its introduc-</page><page sequence="67">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 479 tion, he defends Rossetti's poems and paintings as heritors of a late ro- mantic tradition which "began and ended ... as the quest for an art and a literature that was no longer possible" ("that must be lost") (p. xiv), noble efforts to "demonstrate the sensuous operations of intelligence" (p. xv), and quasi-philosophical exemplars of "forms of truth unfounded by any myth of enlightenment" (p. xvii). In subsequent chapters he develops these assertions through a variety of reprises into an extended meditation on the somber tonalities of Rossetti's art and poetry. In "A Dynamic of Reflection," the book's first chapter, McGann responds to modernist critiques that Rossetti was "in one perspective . . . too romantic and idiosyncratic, [and] in another . . . mired in inherited conventions" (p. 3), with a defense of his recurrent preoccupations with the "cognitive nature of immediated sensual perception" (p. 7), his desires to preserve an "inner standing point," his awareness of the recessive and reflective questions of "images [which] call out to images" (p. 23), and his deeply un-Morrisian cztadzn-sensibilities ("uninterested and unimpressed with the country God made, he wanted the Man-made town" [p. 5]). In the second and third chapters ("Intelligence in Love: Medieval v. Victorian v. Modern" and "Dante and Rossetti: Translation, Pastiche, Ritual, Fate"), McGann considers Rossetti's theories of translation, sacral views of art, and reception of Dante and other medieval sources. In "In- telligence in Love," framed as an argument against T. S. Eliot's hostile view of Rossetti's art, he argues that "apparent excess of detail" in Rossetti's early painting The Girlhood of Mary Virgin and his poems on paintings guided the viewer toward aesthetic reformulations of the painting's osten- sible subject, manifested the painting's "fundamental brain work," and cre- ated a "hyperrealism that anticipate^] certain Post-modern styles" (p. 32). As he interprets Rossetti's translations of the Vita Nuova, moreover, Rossetti conceived the Beatrice-ideal in terms that were "religious in tone but skeptical in ... understanding" (p. 43), for "Dante's ideological hori- zon translated Beatrice into elaborate conceptual equivalents [, but] Rossetti took all the equivalents at face value. They [were] for him decorative additions to the central (artistic) event: not truths but forms of truth" (p. 36). He also reviews Pater's views that Rossetti's poetry manifested origi- nality of vocabulary, "genuine intellectual structure," forms of (de facto proto-modernist) self-consciousness, and "mythopoeic" evocations of the past which manifested "the ideal aspects of common things." In chapter 3, "Dante and Rossetti," McGann identifies certain debts to the Italian stilnovista, among them Rossetti's "screen"-like use of dis- placements and personifications, cultivation of artifice and "impersonal rhetoric" (p. 48), and ambiguities of reference which expressed "magical</page><page sequence="68">480 / VICTORIAN POETRY ideas of art and language" (p. 59)- As an instance of the latter, he traces out a pointed biographical application of bleak lines inscribed in a manu- script begun in 1848 and buried with Elizabeth Siddal in 1862, which William Michael Rossetti published as "Another Love" and "Praise and Prayer" in 1898 and 1911- "I could not thank / God for the cup of evil that I drank: / . . . And so I sank / Into the furnished phrases smooth and blank / Which we all learn in childhood." McGann views these as un- canny anticipations of "a sudden death [which] turned these poetic exer- cises of 1848 [into] prophetic poems about his wife, whom he had not even met" (p. 64). In "The Iconic Page," his fourth chapter, McGann examines "the continued stress Rossetti place [d] on the idea of the total book, and (cor- relatively) on the relation between iconic and verbal expression" (p. 70), and considers as examples of this holist paradigm his book designs, frames for pictures, illustrations for translations, and assorted correlations be- tween his translations and their respective originals. He also comments on Rossetti's rearrangements of his works in "The Kelmscott Love Son- nets," a selection of "House of Life" poems he copied out for Jane Morris in 1874, and a sequence of "Three Songs" associated with three of his paintings. McGann praises Rossetti for his oft-remarked ability to "see his texts as visible things" (p. 75), in the sonnets on pictures, for example, whose diction and verbal patterning resisted "the sublimities of conceptualization, by an adventure among pure physical forms" (p. 82). In "Ars Negativa," his fifth chapter, McGann characterizes Rossetti's search for an iconography of ideal presences and conceptual Aufhebung, in the prose tale "Hand and Soul," in the painting The Girlhood of Mary Virgin" and in assorted verbal and material canvasses of hieratically sen- sualized women, as forms of "literal" self- reference and mystical ars negativa in service to a "transnatural idea" (p. 89). In McGann's view, Rossetti's search for such an ars prompted him to adopt "an inner standing point" of images, illusions, and "self- ironies," which were "not critical moves [but] blocking devices that serve[d] to maintain the illusion of objectivity" (the specific reference here is to "Jenny," p. 192). McGann also contrasts Rossetti's "fetishized women" with the stylized nude figure in Manet's "Olympia," praises Rossetti for a "skeptical view of Impressionism" which "might be usefully recovered" (p. 103), and remarks, somewhat more ob- scurely, that "[c]oming as fetish forms [Rossetti's women] come in judge- ment. ... If we turn from them, imagining an escape through a new and different language, we will find that they possess the power to return, like Mailer's armies of the night. For they are us, male and female alike. And their fetishism defines their truth" (p. 104)- In "Venus Surrounded by Mirrors, Reflecting Her in Different Views,"</page><page sequence="69">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 481 the book's sixth chapter, McGann considers Rossetti's many lifelong at- tempts to realize the elusively narcissistic subject of "Venus surrounded by mirrors, reflecting her in different views" (a description he jotted down in a notebook in 1870), and construes favorably the absence of geometrical perspective in his work as a prismatic attempt to draw the viewer "into the painting at different angles" (p. 114)- Along similar lines, he suggests, the sonnets "complicate [d] the text's system of first-person address by turning its lyrical focus into a theater of different voices and points of view" (p. 138), aspectual shifts which were "poised within some ordering and significant patterns that we can see and hear but that escape concep- tual formulation" (p. 141). In "The Sinking Star," his seventh chapter, McGann reviews the grim decline in Rossetti's last years and thereafter of his artistic powers and posthumous reputation, vigorously defends Rossetti against Ford Madox Hueffer's charge that he was "an amateur who failed in two arts" and undertook to play an illusive "game that must be lost" (p. 144), af- firms once again his "startling wordplays, [which] focus [ed] the operation at an atomic level, torquing the poems for odd associations, unexpected meanings, bizarre or seemingly random suggestions," and concludes with a gnomic paradox that the "truth" of "The House of Life" was "so much better than it trie[d] to be because so much worse than it seem[ed]." Toward the work's end, McGann also contrasts Rossetti's paintings with the work of Marcel Duchamp, remarks that "the later dream of Intel- ligence in Love was perhaps most completely realized in the astonishing Astarte Syriaca, a dream of knowledge that would be open, shameless, and - consquently - forbidden" (p. 157), and avers that some of Rossetti's later paintings were "repellent," for they went "too far and [knew] too much. . . . They . . . engage [d] in acts of self-exposure at a time and in a vantage that many artists would find too terrible to put on display" (p. 153). The last remark, in my view, almost cries out for forms of feminist analysis and psychological insight that eluded Rossetti's horizon, and may lie outside this work- Be that as it may, McGann develops a strong case in The Game That Must Be Lost for the aesthetic virtues of certain forms of Victorian roman- tic sensibility, forms that were shared by other "great" poets and artists of the period, such as Tennyson, Robert or Elizabeth Barrett Browning, whose works might be interpreted in analogous ways as embodiments of anti- "modernist" views avant la lettre. He is also at his most original when he applies his strikingly extensive knowledge of Rossetti's manuscripts to specific correlations between verbal and visual texts. On balance, however, Rossetti's intentions and achievements do not seem to bear the full weight of the extensive critical, theoretic, and</page><page sequence="70">482 / VICTORIAN POETRY idea-historical claims that Dante Gabriel Rossetti: The Game That Must Be Lost makes on their behalf, and there seems to be little place for reformist critiques or feminist responses to Rossettian "fetishization" of das ewig Weibliche in the work's studies of "fundamental brainwork." Rossetti him- self, on the other hand - a man who believed "Imitation is Criticism" - would surely have been pleased to be gathered into the company of "great" thinkers and artists with whom McGann has compared him (William James, Charles Sanders Pierce, Plato, Blake, Manet, Duchamp). Two of the three articles on Dante Rossetti which appeared during the year focused on his aims for translation. In "The Translation Strate- gies of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ezra Pound and Paul Blackburn" (Ezra Pound and Poetic Influence, ed. Helen Dennis, Rodopi), Helen Dennis re- examines Rossetti's sonnet-translations and theory of translation, argues that he sought to "domesticate" a translated text, "rather than enact its foreignness" or translate it "into a contemporary discourse," and con- cludes that he made of such texts in consequence "beautiful possession[s] to be treasured by the bourgeois household in the capitalist nation." Pound and his disciple Blackburn, by contrast, transformed the medieval canzone's erotic focus on the "Lady" into a "mask through which to perform dis- tinctly modernist and masculinist concerns, which focus on performance of masculine personality in poetic discourse." In "A Commentary on Some of Rossetti's Translations from Dante" (]PRS 9, Spring), Jerome McGann has also provided a commentary on fourteen poems from Rossetti's translation of the Vita Nuova in his Early Italian Poets. Rossetti himself had argued that literal translation is ped- antry, and claimed that "the only true motive for putting poetry into a fresh language must be to endow a fresh nation, as far as possible, with one more possession of beauty," and McGann affirms that "Rossetti's trans- lations of these poems function within a 'performative' aesthetic whereby the act of translational rendering resurrects, as it were, the vital life of the original poetry." In his detailed glosses of particular poems, McGann ex- amines some of Rossetti's extensive departures from his originals, and the complex attempts he undertook (critiqued, in effect, by Dennis) to find contemporary English counterparts for medieval locutions. In "Rossetti's 'Jenny': Aestheticising the Whore" (PLL 36, no. 3), Lawrence J. Starzyk argues that the poem's narrative ambiguities reflected the mental confusions of its speaker; that Rossetti's uses of imagery subli- mated complex and contradictory patterns of desire, frustration, financial insecurity, and threatened self-esteem ("the aureoled countenance of the woman framed in holy light reflects not the honor or dishonor of a vessel but the emptiness of the artist projecting himself within the framing light"); and that "the profligate throwing away of money [in the poem's</page><page sequence="71">FLORENCE S. BOOS 1 483 final scene] belies the psychological bankruptcy resulting from the speaker's recognition of how expensive or dear the dawning of emptiness is-" Starzyk's views echo early reviewers' responses to some of the gentleman-narrator's evasions, and he would also find them confirmed in more recent feminist studies of Victorian masculinity, among them Susan Brown's "Economical Representations" (VRev 17, 1991), in which she pointedly contrasted "Jenny" with Augusta Webster's feminist portrayal of a prostitute in "The Castaway." Relatively few studies of Christina Rossetti seem to have appeared this year, but two essays proposed new sources for her poems- In "A Pos- sible Pictorial Inspiration for Christina Rossetti's 'The Prince's Progress,'" (JPRS 9, Fall), D.M.R. Bentley comments on several parallels between William Windus' painting Too Late (exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1859), and Rossetti's "The Prince's Progress," about a man who comes "[t]oo late for love, too late for joy" to his lover's deathbed. Windus's betrayed woman, as Bentley remarks, apparently died of consumption, and Rossetti's heroine suffered from a form of "wasting," whose exact symp- toms she left undefined. In "Another Note on 'Goblin Market'" (JPRS 9, Spring), Jan Marsh traces parallels with Goblin Market in two of Dante Rossetti's translations in Early Italian Poets, Especially striking are resemblances Marsh has found between Goblin Market's uneven meter and the two sisters' precipitous escape, and a passage from Franco Sacchetti's "On a Wet Day" in which girls run from a frightening object in the undergrowth: "And flying, stum- bling, tumbling, wrong or right; / One sets her knee / There where her foot should be; / One has her hands and dress / All smother'd up with mud in a fine mess; / And one gets trampled on by two or three." In "'O Wanton Eyes Run Over': Repetitition and Fantasy in Chris- tina Rossetti" (VP 38, no. 4), Suzy Waldman argues that "psychoanalytic criticism . . . has higher hopes for making sense of a heterogeneous poetic subject like Rossetti than do interpretative strategies which read litera- ture entirely as surfaces of contending discourses" (p. 550). She therefore applies Lacanian paradigms to the poems' "supremely charged expressions of a person desperately trying to keep her desire without losing herself (p. 550), and finds continuing tension between "symbolic" and "imaginary" orders in Rossetti's work - the former manifested in repetitive compul- sions and searches for self-mortification, and the latter in paradoxical views of death as "attempt[s] to free desire from restricted forms" (p. 536). She also asserts that "it was only through gendered Christian dis- courses that Rossetti saw a means to escape the bounds of gender" (p. 543), an apparent partial return to discourse- theory, and seeks to recuper- ate "Rossetti's famous morbidity" not "as an internalization of Victorian</page><page sequence="72">484 / VICTORIAN POETRY patriarchy's misogyny, but as a revolt against its restrictions on her desire" (p. 537). Waldman's rhetorical identification of death-fantasies with pres- ervation of "the free play of desire beyond sexual roles and social limits" seems dubious, but her variant forms of "recuperation" may offer new insights into several of Rossetti's poems. In "Remembering and Recovering 'Goblin Market' in Rosario Ferre's Tico Rico, Mandorico'" (Critique 41, no- 4), Ronald D. Morrison exam- ines Ferre's self-conscious reworking of the plot of Rossetti's poem, ob- serves that feminist elements latent in Rossetti's original emerged more explicitly in the work of her successor, a well-known Puerto Rican writer, and argues that "Rossetti use[d] the power of sisterhood as a way to pre- serve feminine strength and self-sufficiency, whereas Ferre's story con- tinually points to the social significance of the sisters' relationship and its challenge to the patriarchal culture." In "A Stop Press Correction in Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market" (PBSA 94, no. 1), Maura Ives studies Rossetti's corrections in the proofs of her best-known volume, and observes that her detailed revisions of a proof-copy now at the Humanities Research Center further delayed the volume's appearance, already set back by her brother's tardy provision of agreed-upon illustrations. Ives weighs the liabilities and advantages of Dante's involvement in the volume's publication, and concludes that the complex interchanges of the collaboration "served [in the end] to strengthen Christina's . . . influence over [her first two] books' biblio- graphic and linguistic codes." Ruth Kinna's William Morris: The Art of Socialism (Univ. of Wales), a strong successor to Bradley Macdonald's William Morris and the Aesthetic Constitution of Politics (1999), offered the year's most substantial contribu- tion to Morris criticism. Kinna begins her study of Morris' life, beliefs, and social and artistic thought with a reassessment of the continuity of his "romantic" and socialist views. In her chapter on "Slavery and the Ancient Constitution," she then subjects Morris' ideas about women, men, "manliness," and the family to one of the more searching feminist analyses in print, and concludes that "whether women were lesser beings or simply different, the essence of Morris's claim was that the conditions for women's well-being and freedom were not the same as they were for men" (p. 136). In her study of "Dreams and Reality of Change," Kinna examines views of literary value, historical progression, and "paradise" expressed in The Life and Death of Jason and The Earthly Paradise, and remarks of the latter that "Morris's stories explored the difference between paradise and earth through the eyes of human visitors to the divine realm. . . . The gods take vengeance on their creations, but by threatening to lay waste to</page><page sequence="73">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 485 the earth, they give humans the opportunity to restore it to its original beauty" (p. 70). In her penultimate chapter on "Literature and Revolu- tion," she also reexamines representations of "economy," "civility," "fam- ily," "politics," "fellowship," and "the character of Utopia" in the late prose romances as well as News from Nowhere, and concludes, correctly if a bit paradoxically, that Morris' heroes were more reluctant to "fall victim to dreams" (p. 192) in his great Utopian romances, and that in them he finally resolved "the tragic conflicts that plagued the lovers in his early literature" (p. 197). Kinna concludes her attempt to reconcile the inde- terminacies and divergences of Morris' complex life and work with the cogent observation that "Morris's aim [in News] was not to show how the good society should be organized, but to show how good society could be if the barriers to freedom and fellowship were removed" (p. 216). Several articles and a book-chapter revisited Morris' early poetry this year. In "William Morris's 'The Mosque Rising in the Place of the Temple of Solomon': A Critical Text" (JPRS 9, Spring), William Whitla provides a full scholarly apparatus for Morris's unsuccessful entry in the 1855 Newdigate Prize competition at Oxford. He places this 300-line poem in the context of British interest in the history of contested Mus- lim and Christian "holy places" during the Crimean War, and contrasts it with the entries of Morris' more succcessful competitors Edward Haydon Osborn and Robert William Henderson, whose contributions "raise [d] the proper nationalist sentiments in the climate of war, trace [d] the roots of sectarian conflict to religious retribution, heap[ed] scorn on Jews and Muslims, and look[ed] forward to a more . . . Christian . . . future fore- shadowed in the present political alliances of the Crimean War." Morris' poem, by contrast, "remain[ed] true to the old chroniclers, but avoid[ed] conventional racialist positions and the nationalistic partisanship of con- temporary politics." Whitla, who is the first clear advocate and close stu- dent of this "juvenile" work (Morris was twenty-one), finds real merits in its anticipation of the Defence-poems and its "range of reference, . . . precise observation and . . . refusal to take a narrowly nationalist, racial- ist, or archaeological side." In "Medieval Drama and Courtly Romance in William Morris' 'Sir Galahad, A Christmas Mystery'" (VP 38, no. 3), Catherine Stevenson and Virginia Hale interpret Morris' Arthurian poems in The Defence as a recreated medieval and Malorian mystery-cycle. Their supplement to tra- ditional interpretations of the Malorian aspects of Morris' early work seems consistent with its dramatic quality, as well as the loose complementarity of the cycle's poems representing different moods and the four seasons. They develop detailed comparisons of "Sir Galahad" with a number of mystery-plays' dreams, visions, opening monologues (usually complaints),</page><page sequence="74">486 / VICTORIAN POETRY allusions to the liturgical seasons, comments on inner protagonists' di- lemmas, and resolutions in the form of quasi-numinous revelatory experi- ences- In their conclusion, Hale and Stevenson draw on their evidence to argue that Morris' drama did indeed "conflat[e], in a most original way, medieval religious drama and courtly romance." In "Binding Men: William Morris's The Defence ofGuenevere and the Circulation of Masculine Desire" (Private and Public Voices in Victorian Po- etry, ed. Sabine Coelsch-Foisner and Holger Klein, Stauffenburg Verlag), Rosie Miles examines motifs of male rivalry in Morris' drawings and po- ems, and examines male interactions in several Defence poems for expres- sions of the "anxiety about prevailing bourgeois models of masculinity and male sexuality," In marked contrast to Stevenson and Hale, for ex- ample, Miles interprets Christ in "Sir Galahad, A Christmas Mystery" as "a human possessive lover who does not wish the men he loves to relate sexually to women," and reads the death and anticipated execution in "Riding Together" as a manifestation of Morris' anxieties about male bond- ing and violence. She also comments on erotic relationships mediated by male Morrisian rivals, reads "King Arthur's Tomb" as a poetic emblem of Morris' troubled relationship with Rossetti, and concludes that "Arthurian legend appears to have offered Morris a means of representing relation- ships between men, [but 'Sir Galahad'] suggests a questioning of the mas- culinity on offer, and at times a deep disturbance with the possibility of expressing a masculine sexuality." Miles also extends her interpretation to contemporary reception of Morris' work, reading reviewers' well-known attacks on The Defence as veiled expressions of homophobic fears of "the passion of which the out- lets are sealed" which Pater praised, and as implicit recognition of "a secretive masculinity, not easily recognizable to others." All these inter- pretations are compatible with the anxious intensity, outbursts of vio- lence and sublimations of conflict-ridden male loyalty in Morris' early writing, but accord less well with the equally intense, anxious, and ideal- ized heterosexual attractions set out in, for example, "Sir Peter Harpdon's End" and "Concerning Geoffray Teste Noire." Morris was a model of "nega- tive capability," and he sought to reconcile fierce oppositions in politi- cally restless but personally complementary ways. Miles's interpretations help explain some otherwise puzzling features of these early poems, and she might extend her analysis further to the conflicts of comparable in- tensity in the arche typically tragic plots of "The Lovers of Gudrun" and Sigurd the Volsung. In "'Love for the Sake of Love,' William Morris's Debt to Robert Browning in 'Riding Together'" (ELN 37, no. 3), A. A. Markley contrasts one of Morris' poems with Browning's "The Last Ride Together" along</page><page sequence="75">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 487 roughly comparable homosocial lines. Morris had praised "The Last Ride" in the Oxford and Cambridge Review of Men and Women as an expression of "love for love's sake, the only true love, I must say," and Markley finds a Browningesque "fixed, frozen moment in which one realizes life's best" in the speaker's memory of his dead friend's last moments ("His eager face in the clear fresh weather, / Shone out that last time by my side")- Amor- phously pansexual nightmares in Morris' early prose romance "Lindenborg Pool" lend collateral credibility to Markley's discernment of "homoerotic overtones" in Morris' "extension of] the conventional boundaries of gen- der roles in order to allow his speaker to express an honest feeling of 'intense, unmixed love' for his lost friend." One would, however, have to reconcile such readings with the apparent heterosexuality of other early poems such as "Spell-Bound," "Golden Wings," or "The Haystack in the Floods." In Camelot in the Nineteenth Century: Arthurian Characters in the Po- ems of Tennyson, Arnold, Morris, and Swinburne (Greenwood), Laura and Robert Lambdin devote a chapter to a review of the nature and sources of all Morris' Malorian poems, including fragments such as "The Maying of Guenevere," and offer detailed reintepretations of the four poems in The Defence's Malorian cycle. Other critics have anticipated the chapter's ob- servation of the contrasts between the Guenevere-Lancelot poems and those devoted to Galahad and the Grail legend, and endorsed Galahad's cautious doubts whether "the heavenly rewards for this chaste, loveless life will be worth the loneliness and anguish he has experienced on earth" (p. 74)- But the authors' overview provides a helpful summary of Morris' use of sources for first readers of Morris' Arthurian poems and fragments. In "Ruskin and Morris," one of several essays in a Ruskin centenary issue of The Journal of the William Morris Society (14, no. 1), Peter Faulkner provides a thoughtful account of Morris' cordial interrelations with his troubled but receptive older colleague. Morris had chanted passages from Modern Painters to Oxford friends in his youth, defended Ruskin against the criticism of an unknown 1882 correspondent with the remark that "to say one does not always agree with him is to say that he and I are of mankind" (CL, 2:126), paid tribute to him as "a teacher of morals and politics" who "has done serious and solid work towards that new-birth of Society, without which genuine art ... must inevitably cease altogether" in his Kelmscott edition of "The Nature of Gothic" (1892), and remarked that "it was through him that I learned to give form to my discontent" two years before his death in 1896. Less well known is Ruskin's reciprocal respect for Morris, not only as the author of The Defence poems ("most noble - very, very great in- deed - in their own peculiar way," 1869, LJR 36:280), but also of The</page><page sequence="76">488 / VICTORIAN POETRY Earthly Paradise, whose evocations of Greek myth he considered more powerful than those of Keats (Queen of the Air, 1869). Ruskin also com- missioned some of the Firm's stained glass; wrote to Burne-Jones about Morris' anti-imperialist politics in 1876 that "I hope neither Morris nor you will retire wholly again out of such spheres of effort- It seems to me especially a time when the quietest of mankind should be disquieted, and the meekest self-assertive"; and characterized Morris in 1892 as "the ablest man of his time." In "John Ruskin, William Morris, and the Illuminated Manuscript" (JWMS 14, no. 1), Evelyn J. Phimister argues that Morris' familiar views of "the illuminated manuscript [as] a source of inspiration and design, and perhaps most important of all a link with the medieval craftsman" have Ruskinian origins, and draws a parallel between Ruskin's declaration (in 1854 lectures on the principles of manuscript- illumination reported in The Builder) , that "white lines or dots [in thirteenth-century illumina- tion] were most judiciously and effectively introduced for the purpose of gradating colours," and Morris' much later remark (in "Some Notes on the Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages," 1894), that "the colour ... is founded on the juxtaposition of pure red and blue modified by delicate but clear bright lines and 'pearlings' of white." In "The 'Sympathetic Translation' of Patterns: William Morris as Singer, Scribe and Painter" (JWMS 13, no. 4), Isolde Karen Herbert finds a number of parallels between Morris' manuscript- and book-designs and the narrative structures of The Earthly Paradise, She discerns, for ex- ample, a persistent "design of threshold motifs [which] marks moments of change" in "The Lovers of Gudrun," and sees reflections and expressions of motifs of "the period of Morris's most prolific work in calligraphy and manuscript decoration [in] his saga translations (1868-75)." She argues that "the return to the scene of the communal storytelling . . . retains . . . the reader's memory of the work's frame in much the same manner as an observer's eyes move . . . from designs on a carpet to the border," and concludes that "Morris's artistic, social, and political objective involve [d] a method akin to that of the indigo discharge process: the erasure of any unwanted background followed by the application of the lines and colours of a repeating pattern with narrative potential." In "Water in William Morris's Late Prose Romances" (JWMS 13, no. 4), Hilary Newman develops an ambivalent iconography for the water- images in Morris' last three romances (The Water of the Wondrous Isles, The Well at the World's End, and The Sundering Flood), in which the medium of birth becomes a "life-saver as well as a life-taker." It would be interesting to establish whether a duality of water- images flowed equably throughout Morris' work - as it did in the early "Blue Closet," for example - or emerged</page><page sequence="77">FLORENCE S. BOOS / 489 more prominently in the literary archetypes of his final years. In "From Pastoral Arcadia to Stable-State Mini-Cities: Morris's News from Nowhere and Callenbach's Ecotopia" (JWMS 14, no- 1), Martin Delveaux contrasts News from Nowhere with Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia (1975) to the latter's detriment. Despite Morris' and Callenbach's appar- ent common interests in "green" cities, balanced interrelations with na- ture and pre- as well as post- industrial technologies, Delveaux finds "an ecofascist dystopia" in Ecotopia's central-committee- imposed price con- trols, limits to contact with the outside world, and programmatically ag- gressive military responses to potential invasions, and concludes that in- terpretations of Ecotopia as a sequel to News from Nowhere are "dubious to say the least." In "William Morris: 'Back to the Land,' Pessimism and Utopia" (JWMS 13, no. 4 ), John Payne (author of Journey up the Thames: William Morris and Modern England [Five Leaves Press, 2000]), sketches several of the many parallels that might be traced between Morris' views and those of Peter Kropotkin, comments on Morris' responses to the ideas of Ed- ward Carpenter, and considers some of the implications of Nowhere 's well- known reconfiguration of the Houses of Parliament as a capacious and socially useful manure-shed. After canvassing other aspects of Morris' Utopian thought, he considers which attributes of News from Nowhere are relevant in the aftermath of twentieth-century events which "[have ren- dered] the theory of violent socialist revolution . . . implausible," and finds answers in the ideals of "self-management, unalienated labour, eco- logical responsibility, distributive justice, [and] sexual equality" which Ruth Levitas has described in her study of The Concept of Utopia, In "William Morris, the Socialist Reviewer" (JWMS 13, no. 4), Nicho- las Salmon examines a number of passages from Morris' reviews of George Bernard Shaw's realist novel Cashel Byron s Profession, Emile Zola's Germi- nal, and Henrik Ibsen's The Doll's House for Commonweal and justice, and argues that Morris responded more sympathetically to the conventions of the modern realist novel and drama than many critics have supposed. Morris defended Germinal, for example, in his characteristically "plain" first-person style: "I hold that 'What is not too bad to be done, is not too bad to be told about,' though I find no difficulty in imagining that our rulers and masters take a very different view of the subject. ... I hold that there are dozens of most respectable works which the Vigilance Society wouldn't think of attacking, which are far more demoralising and cor- rupting than Zola. Henry James's novels for instance [possibly a reference to the anti-anarchist Princess Casamassima, published in 1886]; or even in [its] feeble way, Mr. Besant's imitation of Charles Reade." He defended Ibsen along similar ideological lines: "I note that the critics say that Ibsen's</page><page sequence="78">490 / VICTORIAN POETRY plays are pessimistic; so they are - to pessimists; and all intelligent people who are not Socialists are pessimists. But the representation of the cor- ruption of society carries with it in Ibsen's work aspirations for a better state of things." A wave of renewed attention to Dante Rossetti's poetry has given a somewhat different direction to this year's outline of recent work on Pre- Raphaelitism. But unawareness or disregard of prior work and feminist insights in a few of the studies I have reviewed may recapitulate Santayana's dictum (in slight paraphrase), that those who ignore the past are con- demned to repeat it- Many central preoccupations of Pre-Raphaelite po- ets, artists, craft- workers, and social critics have engaged commentators for almost a century and a half now, but recurrent cycles of academic attention and inattention seem to bear miniature witness to the revenant's stoic insight in A Dream of John Ball, that descendents of apparent win- ners of struggles for "fellowship" will "have to fight for what they meant, under another name." Swinburne MARGOT K. LOUIS This has been a good year for Swinburne studies, particularly for analyses which situate the poet within the broader cultural context. Three pieces deserve special mention at the start: Stephanie Kuduk's explora- tion of the radical literary tradition informing Songs before Sunrise; Catherine Maxwell's erudite discussion of how Swinburne transforms the very differ- ent literary tradition of the female sublime; and Thais Morgan's precise mapping of the versions of masculinity presented by Swinburne and other Victorian poets. In these pages last year I covered Kenneth Haynes's fine new edition, Poems and Ballads &amp; Atalanta in Calydon, as well as John Hollander's "Algernon Charles Swinburne's 'At Eleusis'" (Paris Review 154 [2000]: 246-251), so I will say no more of them here. One of the most innovative studies of the year is Stephanie Kuduk's "'A Sword of a Song': Swinburne's Republican Aesthetics in Songs before Sunrise" (VS 43 [2001]: 253-278). Kuduk places Swinburne within the radical literary tradition in "a world in which poetry provided a central way of experiencing radical politics" and poets used prophecy to recreate "a democratic human mythos" (pp. 255, 258). The "Hymn of Man," "Hertha," and "Christmas Antiphones" are discussed in detail, and Kuduk shows brilliantly how Swinburne's formal innovations (e.g., the elaborate antimetaboles in "Hertha") convey and enrich the poet's republican vi- sion. Finally, Kuduk shows how reviewers and readers of Swinburne's work within "the vibrant culture of republicanism in the 1860s and 1870s"</page><page sequence="79">MARGOT K. LOUIS 1491 embraced the poetry and recognized it as a part of the radical literary tradition. This article should be read by all students of Swinburne. Kuduk is unusual among Swinburneans nowadays in that she ex- plores an area outside the study of gender and sexuality, which remain the chief issues engrossing students of the poet. Catherine Maxwell's thought- ful and finely nuanced book, The Female Sublime from Milton to Swinburne: Bearing Blindness (Manchester Univ. Press, 2001), challenges "modern cultural criticism's view of literary feminisation as a response to social change" and argues that the feminization of the male poet is "the inevi- table outcome of a poetic tradition which has always . . . identified lyrical song with femininity"; "male poets' adoption of feminine identities and images is less a matter of appropriation than of compulsion as they are driven towards feminisation in order to attain vision" (pp. 3, 4, 2; emphasis Maxwell's). Experience of the sublime figuratively blinds and castrates the poet so that he sees in a new way but also understands himself in a radi- cally new way which is painful; the "female sublime" is "frequently envis- aged by male poet[s] as a penetrating and often aggressive energy which overwhelms or pierces a man's body and soul" (p. 7). Maxwell discusses Milton, Shelley, Tennyson, and Browning, concluding with a chapter on Swinburne, who "emerges as a timely flowering of the English poetic tra- dition and an important precursor for literary Modernism"; "the book thus offers a new assessment of his important poetic contribution to En- glish letters" (p. 3). Swinburneans should pay special attention not only to the separate chapter on Swinburne but also to "Swinburne and the Sapphic Nightin- gale" (pp. 37-46), a subsection of chapter 1. Here Maxwell's discussion of Swinburne's complex identification with Sappho finely illuminates "The Nightingale," "Anactoria," and especially "On the Cliffs." It is regrettable that Maxwell's book was in press too early for her to engage in this text with Yopie Prins's Victorian Sappho (1999), but anyone interested in this topic should certainly read both works; for me, Maxwell provides a more balanced and convincing account of the Sapphic sublime. In chapter 5, "Beneath the woman's and the water's kiss: Swinburne's metamorphosis" (pp. 178-221), a discussion of Swinburne in relation to Sappho, Milton, Shelley, Tennyson, and Browning modulates into thoughtful analyses of the emasculated masculinity so frequently explored in Swinburne's poems and criticism, and of the "poetics of masochism" and its relation to Swinburne's notoriously non-visual poetic style; his famous "haziness" shows that he has less interest "in fixed meanings and finite perceptions than in the imaginative process by which thoughts and ideas evolve into images which are themselves already mutating into other images" (pp. 187, 196). Maxwell's discussion of synaesthesia and chiasmus does more</page><page sequence="80">492 / VICTORIAN POETRY to enrich our understanding of Swinburne's style than any criticism since John Rosenberg's. A sensitive reading of "August," with its "sexual twi- light ... in which senses, bodies, natural objects merge and mingle al- most imperceptibly" (p. 199), introduces a richly informed and delicate analysis of "Hermaphroditus" which moves far beyond Richard Dellamora's relatively crude interpretation of that lyric- From this Maxwell moves on to the images of alchemical marriage and renewal within "the watery womb of the sea" (p. 215), discussing "Les Noyades," the conclusion to Tristram ofLyonesse, and "The Lake of Gaube," and ending with "A Nympholept," where the speaker is in a different way incorporated into the body of the female sublime. Thais E. Morgan's "The Poetry of Victorian Masculinities," in The Cambridge Companion to Victorian Poetry, ed. Joseph Bristow (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000), pp. 203-227, which focuses particularly on Tennyson, Arnold, and Swinburne, provides a more diverse if necessarily sketchier analysis of the various versions of masculinity explored in Swinburne's poetry. She considers the eponymous hero of Tristram of Lyonesse as "Swinburne's version of heroic masculinity in the medievalizing mode," while Iseult's "powerful and non-conformist selfhood flouts the Victorian ideal of womanliness" (pp. 214-216); Morgan also examines the "oscilla- tions of gender identity" explored in "On the Cliffs" and "Hermaphroditus" (pp. 219-220, 224), the critique of various previous norms of gender in "Faustine," "Les Noyades," and "Before a Crucifix" (pp. 210, 218-219), and the construction of a Hellenic principle of "poetic manhood" in "The Last Oracle," "In the Bay," and "Thalassius" (p. 219). In the same volume, Karen Alkalay-Gut's essay "Aesthetic and Deca- dent poetry" (pp. 228-254) features Swinburne prominently. Alkalay-Gut discusses Swinburne's Aestheticist self- justification and its perils (pp. 228-230), and explores his representation of perverse sexuality in "Dolores," "The Leper," and "Laus Veneris" particularly (pp. 232-234); she demon- strates that these works analyze the assumptions underlying Victorian moral attitudes, and that Swinburne is not merely transgressive. Other essays in this book discuss Swinburne in part. Joseph Bristow in "Reform- ing Victorian Poetry: Poetics after 1832" ends his discussion with Swinburne's insistence on the "anti-Utilitarian, unprophetic, and amoral condition of poetry" which rejects the Carlylean ideal of poet as socially beneficent vates (pp. 20-22); and John Lucas in "Voices of Authority, Voices of Subversion: Poetry in the Late Nineteenth Century" presents Swinburne's eager plunges into controversy (both in the quarrel with Buchanan and in Songs before Sunrise, with its atheism and political radi- calism) as representative of a powerful strain in Victorian poetry (pp. 290-292). Overall, this volume shows more recognition of Swinburne's</page><page sequence="81">MARGOT K. LOUIS / 493 diverse contributions to Victorian culture than is common in such gen- eral studies; and for the student of Swinburne it performs the very helpful function of placing the poet within the context (I should say, "contexts") of his time. A context not too often discussed emerges in Allison Pease's Mod- ernism, Mass Culture, and the Aesthetics of Obscenity (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000), which includes a chapter on Swinburne (pp. 37-71) as "an intriguing transitional figure whose 1866 Poems and Ballads began to de- stabilize the previously established boundaries between what could be con- sidered aesthetic and what pornographic" (p. xiii). This chapter is less concerned with analyzing the poetry than Pease's earlier article, "Ques- tionable Figures: Swinburne's Poems and Balhds" (VP 35 [1997]: 43-56), although some passages from the article reappear in altered form. Pease's focus now, however, is on the cultural context for the controversy pro- voked by Poems and Ballads: the widening of literacy, the class anxieties created by the appearance of a new reading public, the mass production of pornography, the aristocratic libertine tradition, and the lower class in- version of that tradition. When "writers and artists identified with high culture" began to include "the sexual body" in their works as a part of "the realm of legitimate culture," they were in effect "making sex and the sexu- alized body safe for the middle class and the realm of high art" (pp. 63-64)- Yet this was a thankless endeavor, as the panic greeting Poems and Ballads showed all too clearly. Complementing Pease's chapter, Simon Eliot's article "Hotten: Rot- ten: Forgotten? An Apologia for a General Publisher" (Book History 3 [2000]: 61-93) provides useful background on the publisher who took up Poems and Ballads when Moxon had abandoned it. Hotten also received some of Swinburne's pornographic works, which caused considerable anxi- ety for Swinburne later on, although this is not an issue which Eliot or Pease discuss. But the publisher "seems to have had a genius for alien- ation," and the virulence of Hotten and Swinburne's later relationship mirrored that of many other connections between Hotten and his writers (p. 77). Nicholas Freeman's "Tailing into Philistine Hands': Swinburne's Transgressive Correspondence," in Jennifer A. Wagner-Lawlor, ed., The Victorian Comic Spirit: New Perspectives (Ashgate, 2000), predominantly explores the sexual comedy created in Swinburne's letters through parody and allusion. Specificially, Freeman shows how in The Swinburne Letters the parodies of the Brownings' work and the "Bogshire Banner" fantasies reveal the poet's "aggressively aristocratic" stance both as a well-born man and as member of "another aristocracy - a loose assemblage of artists and writers who flouted bourgeois convention" (pp. 182, 183).</page><page sequence="82">494 / VICTORIAN POETRY While sexuality in Swinburne's work remains an ever-fruitful topic, very little attention has been paid to his presentation of sexual violence. My own "Swinburne on Rape" (JPRS n.s. 9 [Fall 2000]: 55-68) tries to rectify this omission, and shows how the concept of rape "constituted a complex challenge to Swinburne's peculiar combination of male hedo- nism, masochism, identification with the female, and passionate devo- tion to the cause of personal and political freedom" (p. 55). Swinburne presents rapes and near rapes throughout his lyrical work, in "The Night- ingale," "At Eleusis," "Les Noyades," "The Leper," "Itylus," Atalanta, Erechtheus, "The Garden of Cymodoce," and "A Nympholept." Sometimes he blurs the reality of the violation, sometimes he stresses the anguish and silencing of the victim, but most often he shows how "rape creates binary, incompatible realities: the experience of the person raped . . . and the experience of the rapist," two individuals "in a relationship which is utterly devoid of relation, of personal connection" (pp. 55-56). This "tor- turing binary" embodies the violence and division which at times seem to Swinburne "the one pervasive and essential reality in the universe," and so offers us the hauntingly horrific vision of a deity who "inspires (or even enacts) rape" (pp. 56, 66); in the late lyric "A Nympholept" Swinburne strongly rejects a mysticism based on the model of rape. This article fo- cuses on the "economics of pain and pleasure, and . . . the metaphysical dimension of rape's binary reality" (p. 66). This year has seen few studies focused exclusively on one or two lyrics by Swinburne. A comparison of Whistler's The Little White Girl and Swinburne's "Before the Mirror" appears in Jette Kjeldsen's "What Can the Aesthetic Movement Tell us about Aesthetic Education?" (Journal of Aesthetic Education 35, no.l [Spring 2001]: 85-97). The analysis of Swinburne's poem and its correspondences with Whistler's painting com- pares very favorably with J. Hillis Miller's "Whistler/Swinburne: 'Before the Mirror'" (JPRS 9 [Spring 2000]: 12-24), discussed in these pages last year; Kjeldsen provides a closer reading of the lyric's formal effects and reversal of conventional metaphors, and connects Swinburne's techniques and effects with Pater's version of Aestheticism, which Kjeldsen sees as democratizing aesthetic experience rather than as conducive to elitism. Nathan Cervo's "A Note on 'Swallow' in Swinburne's 'Itylus'" (VN 99 [Spring 2001]: 15-16) insists that the word "swallow," repeated sixteen times in the poem, should be read as a punning reference to "what amounts to the devouring of his own children by Chronos (Time) and to Mother Nature's complicity in the perennial 'feast of Daulis'" (p. 15). The pun, says Cervo, is used "as a sort of chomping counterpoint to the poem's otherwise delicately emotional tonalities and deep harmonies" (p. 15). Such an effect would be characteristically Swinburnean, though I am not</page><page sequence="83">UARGOT K. LOUIS / 495 entirely persuaded that it exists in this particular poem. A few other works should be mentioned which return us to the challenge of situating Swinburne within his diverse contexts. Laura Cooner Lambdin and Robert Thomas Lambdin's Camelot in the Nineteenth Cen- tury: Arthurian Characters in the Poems of Tennyson, Arnold, Morris, and Swinburne (Greenwood Press, 2000) includes a straightforward, compe- tent, and unsubtle chapter on Swinburne's Arthuriana (pp. 107-141). Despite the subtitle, this book focuses not on the characters but on "the poets' ways of approaching . . . love and death," but the Lambdins' survey of Swinburne's Arthuriana does not go as deeply into Swinburne's vision of love as Antony Harrison does in Swinburne s Medievalism (1988). The Lambdins do, however, paraphrase the poems fully, quote lavishly if not always accurately, notice Swinburne's divagations from earlier sources, and provide for the novice a helpful introduction to these poems. In "Literary Dialogues: Rock and Victorian Poetry" (Poetics Today 21, no. 1 [Spring 2000]: 33-60), Karen Alkalay-Gut takes the unusual approach of comparing Victorian lyrics with those of rock songs, and points out that both often explore sadomasochistic passion and, particu- larly, "the silence of the other, usually a generative silence that evokes and intensifies extreme emotions, often love - with, frequently, a dimen- sion of anger" which may produce the murder of the other, or at least a murderous fantasy about her death (p. 49). Alkalay-Gut discusses Swinburne among other Victorian poets fascinated by these issues, and specifically considers his "Rondel" and "Laus Veneris" in connection with two songs by The Cure; she also touches lightly on the social develop- ments which make these themes so attractive in the Victorian age and in our own. Catherine Maxwell's note "Swinburne and Sappho" (N&amp;Q 246 [N.S. 48], no. 2 [June 2001]: 155-158) points out some hitherto unnoticed references to and echoes of Sappho in Swinburne's lyrics. Maxwell also points out that "a significant number of classically educated . . . men would have encountered an uncensored version" of Sappho's work in Poetae Graeci (p. 156). Finally, a section of Swinburne's study of Pericles has been reprinted in Pericles: Critical Essay s, ed. David Skeele (Garland Publishing, 2000), pp. 75-77. I should not close without thanking my research assistant, Julie Brennan, for helping me to find the various critical works here dis- cussed.</page><page sequence="84">496 / VICTORIAN POETRY Tennyson LINDA K. HUGHES Following a hiatus the year once again saw publication of a full- length monograph devoted to Tennyson- James W. Hood's Divining De- sire: Tennyson and the Poetics of Transcendence (Ashgate) explores Tennyson's preoccupation with art and eroticism as complementary means of tran- scending human limits, interests derived from Arthur Henry Hallam and through him Dante. Hood acknowledges Gerhard Joseph's Tennysonian Love as an important precursor of his project, but Hood's particular inter- est is what he terms "divined desire," desire fulfilled cognitively, spiritu- ally, or physically yet never sated. Tennyson's poems as such typically succeed in divined desire better than his characters or speakers, for only the poem satisfies readers aesthetically yet never exhausts their desire to know meaning better. Hood's study thus discloses the fundamental con- nection of two elements long noted in Tennyson's poetry, infinite evoca- tiveness and the themes of love and desire. Hood's study, cogently and freshly (if also repetitiously) argued, makes an especially strong case for the centrality of Tennyson's 1830 female por- traits. Not only do these portraits enact unceasing desire as an ideal, he argues, but Tennyson's frequent recourse to the Renaissance pun on "dy- ing" also demonstrates their underlying carnality, particularly in "Eleanore": "I would be dying evermore." As art these poems perpetuate (without fulfilling) male desire, yet poetic form also acts to contain coquettes who lure men to them, art thus frustrating and furthering the act of (carnal, epistemological) knowing. Hood shows how consistent the preoccupa- tions of major poems like "Mariana" and "The Lady of Shalott" are with "Isabel," "Adeline," or "Lisette," though "Mariana" is an antiphonal voice stressing the crippling imprisonment desire can bring rather than tran- scendence. Hood's Mariana, intriguingly, is an active agent rather than passive sufferer, an artist figure who may fail to imagine alternatives to erotic frustration but who may also be refusing the consolation of spuri- ous hope (and facile epistemology). "The Lady of Shalott" gestures to- ward the possibility of transcending human limits (signified by the lady's imprisonment) through the mirror that is a medium both of artistic in- spiration and erotic desire, though like most readers of the poem Hood ultimately emphasizes its enactment of art's ability to elicit and baffle the desire to know. Hood's chapters on In Memoriam and Idylls of the King are also fresh and illuminating. In Memoriam, he argues, is atypical rather than repre- sentative in the sheer hubris of its claim to have created through language</page><page sequence="85">LINDA K. HUGHES 1 497 a presence - Hallam - with whom divined desire is achievable (and end- lessly consummated). Rather than resuscitating the question of physical love between Tennyson and Hallam, Hood takes for granted the homo- sexual overtones of "descend, touch, and enter" but links the passage to the Dantean framework he sees operative throughout Tennyson's career, so that homosexual union is another trope of and means to union with the divine- Given the pervasive interrelation of sexual, epistemological, and spiritual knowing in the Idylls, Hood argues that "The Lady of Shalott" rather than "Morte d' Arthur" must be seen as the epic's germ. Camelot as symbol of the quest for transcendence is Arthur's artistic creation, not Merlin's; Camelot fails when it is literalized into a mere place by Arthur's followers, failures common to the artistry of Elaine's shield cover and the Lady of Shalott's mirror. I have perforce simplified, in summing, Hood's treatment of a per- vasive theme. Hood's own study satisfies least when it seems to subordi- nate poetry to thematic analysis. Hood's discussion of The Princess is ex- cellent in tracing the genealogy of Lilia (in the prologue and frame) to the coquettes of the female portraits and in clarifying the medley form's en- actment of the difficulties of knowing while inciting interpretive desire. But his remarks on spiritual transcendence in The Princess tell us more about his framework than the poem. Even when Hood's argument seems forced, however, his sensitive engagement with the poetry recuperates the merits of his study, and Divining Desire demonstrates that there is still room for new thematic studies of the poet. Taking this cue from Hood, I will group remaining scholarship ac- cording to subject rather than method. One cluster of essays focuses on the Idylls, mostly in terms of masculinity. Clinton Machann's "Tennyson's King Arthur and the Violence of Manliness" (VP 38 [2000]: 199-226) re- envisions the Idylls in terms of the conflicting masculine models of Christ's gentleness and the imperial warrior's aggression. Though Tennyson sanc- tioned aggression as a cultural and even moral good in service to empire, he saw violence as always threatening to slip free of self-discipline and become anarchic and destructive, as with Pelleas after he becomes the Red Knight. That the earliest and last idylls Tennyson wrote both ex- plored male aggression and inadequate self-discipline (in the figures of Geraint and Balin) indicates how thoroughly issues of masculinity are woven into the poem and the cogent force of Machann's analysis. I would have liked Machann to do more to tease out the full implications of his initial claim that "Tennyson's representation of male violence ... is com- plicated by tensions and contradictions that subvert the idealized code of chivalry and imply that the foundations of Western civilization are much less stable than commonly assumed" (p. 202). Is Tennyson ahead of his</page><page sequence="86">498 / VICTORIAN POETRY time in perceiving masculinity as an unstable social construct, or is he duped by his own flawed masculine ideal? Machann swerves instead to the point that the dreamlike framework of myth allowed Tennyson to have his contradictions and a unified poem too. Similarly, when Machann remarks that "femininity is blameworthy in the Idylls" insofar as "it fails to control the innate, irrational, and destructive forces of the male" (p. 215), he tacitly aligns Tennyson's poem with Ruskin's "Of Queens' Gardens" but does not pursue the connection. I would have preferred to hear more about masculinity instead, including the problem of male sexuality in the good warrior as exemplified by Lancelot, who is curiously absent from this essay. But that Machann's essay leaves one asking for more is a sign of its interest and use. Richard D. Mallen's "The 'Crowned Republic' of Tennyson's Idylls of the King" (VP 37 [1999]: 275-289), inadvertently omitted last year, exam- ines shifting notions of the monarchy after the Second Reform Bill and their effect on representations of Arthur's body. Early in the Idylls Tennyson follows the medieval legal fiction of the king's two bodies, whereby the king is both an individual mortal and an immortal, transcendent "head" of the nation joined in mystical bond with knights and subjects who are his active "limbs." This, Mallen argues, helps account for Arthur's am- biguously sexed and gendered body, a crux of critical discussion in recent decades. As the realm unravels Arthur increasingly becomes a figure- head, just as the British monarch after 1867 lost political power but re- mained a public icon potentially able to quell violence and appropriate power from the masses. Thus in "To the Queen" Tennyson seems to ratify the crown's continuing agency yet also invokes hope for a monarch and people united in common sense ("crowned Republic's crowning common- sense"), which seems to imply a figurehead acknowledged as such by the people. My own "Scandals of Faith and Gender in Tennyson's Grail Poems," in Dhira B. Mahoney's The Grail: A Casebook (Garland), likewise inter- weaves historical developments and politics, in this case the politics of gender and the Oxford Movement, which began the same year Tennyson composed "Sir Galahad." The scandals of the Oxford Movement, espe- cially Newman's conversion, were revived four years before Tennyson com- posed "The Holy Grail" because of the Kingsley-Newman debate in 1864- "Balin and Balan," the last idyll to touch on the grail quest, was composed in the early 1870s against the backdrop of Victorian anthropology and the (Protestant) association of Roman Catholicism with primitivism, and of primitivism with superstition and wanton women. I argue that Tennyson's swerve from the reverential tone of "Sir Galahad" and from Arthurian tradition in representing the grail quest in the Idylls derived from the</page><page sequence="87">LINDA K. HUGHES / 499 dilemma he faced as laureate of a monarch energetically opposed to "Puseyites" and in addressing readers for whom religious ritual, medieval relics, and celibate monks and nuns were inseparable from recent theo- logical scandals and unease about gender and sexuality. If not program- matically, Tennyson's Arthurian poems after "Sir Galahad" tacitly en- dorse conjugal heterosexuality as the via media between hysterical celi- bacy and superstition on one hand and wanton carnality on the other, often making subtle use of blatant language and imagery in documents contemporary with the poems' composition. '"Pure Hearts and Clean Hands': The Victorians and the Grail," by art historian Debra N. Mancoff, also appears in Mahoney's casebook. Though most of Mancoff 's analysis is devoted to painting, especially Burne- Jones's work, she argues that Tennyson's "Sir Galahad" established the dominant image of Galahad as one of boyhood imbued with earnestness, energy, and a deep call to service: "In the Victorian mind, the Grail rep- resented Galahad's code rather than spiritual fulfillment" (p. 450). When "The Holy Grail" forced Tennyson to confront the meaning of the quest itself, he created a vision of failure for the many and success for the singu- larly blessed Galahad, whose preeminent virtue and spirituality were as elusive as the grail, and "dangerous and hubristic to emulate or pursue" (p. 455). Myth and National Identity in Nineteenth-Century Britain: The Legends of King Arthur and Robin Hood (Oxford), by historian Stephanie L. Barczewski, situates the Idylls and its ilk in relation to a competing, in- separable myth of national identity. Whereas Arthur appealed to cultural elites and was often used to promote racialist, imperialist, and masculinist ideologies, Robin Hood provided a vision of Englishness grounded in fierce independence, disdain for authority, and retreat from imperialism (as seen in Richard the Lion-Hearted's abandonment of England for the Cru- sades) into the forest of Sherwood. Barczewski's account of these compet- ing myths reminds us how complex and conflicted, how rarely mono- lithic, a cultural discourse of national identity is. Her study also makes an important contribution to popular culture by recovering a wide array of plays, verse, and fiction dealing with these two figures. But Barczewski deals with literature only in the broadest of terms. For example, she ignores the Pre-Raphaelite subordination of Arthur and the celebration of inward-turning, lawless passion between Lancelot and Guinevere or Tristram and Iseult; and she reads the recurrent reference to the sea in Swinburne's Tristram of Lyonnesse only as a symptom of imperialism (p. 205) despite Swinburne's republican credentials. Nor does she tend to allow a role for prior texts in shaping Victorian plots, as with Galahad's failure to return from his quest (a key detail in Malory if also, as she</page><page sequence="88">500 / VICTORIAN POETRY indicates, likely to suggest the high cost of imperialism for individual soldiers questing abroad). One issue left open for Tennyson scholars is how Tennyson came to write both Idylls of the King and The Foresters, an investigation that might fill in some of the nuances Barczewski omits. Three additional essays address politics in Tennsyon's poetry. "Tennyson's Poetics of Melancholy and the Imperial Imagination," by David Riede (SEL 40 [2000]: 4: 659-678), argues that imperialism, especially as inflected by Orientalism, was crucial to Tennyson's self-creation as a poet and thus to his career as a whole. Riede returns to William Paden's Tennyson in Egypt (1942), merging Paden's documentation of Tennyson's early read- ing with later approaches suggested by Edward Said, Herbert Tucker, and Isobel Armstrong. In basing his early poetry of sensation on narratives of exotic travel and exploration, Tennyson turned his back on utilitarian progress and honed his poetic receptivity to exotic and erotic detail, but at the price of assuming the Orient's inherent otherness and femininity. Typically Tennyson's poems spurn both the Orient and femininity after initially indulging desire for them, acting to reinstate British masculine control. Riede 's larger point is unimpeachable, but I wish he had had the space to develop the constituent parts of his argument more fully. He notes early on that Tennyson's poetic authority relies on melancholy that in turn relies on Orientalism. But the issue of melancholy tends to re- cede. I would also have liked to hear more about how the outward-driv- ing, masculinist imperial energy that carries the poem's (and reader's) perspective to the margin of empire is related to Tennyson's construction of poetic self in terms of - not merely by conquering - the feminine. Might we perhaps conceptualize Tennyson as a poet of bisexual imagination? And how are melancholy poems centered in English, faux-Shakespearean feminine subjectivity, like "Mariana," to be viewed in relation to the ac- tively desiring, Sapphic, Oriental "Fatima"? Riede emphasizes that the Orient in Tennyson's early poems is both center and margin - marginal precisely because the Orient is not imperial center but also central to the very definition of Englishness. More remains to be said in terms of how this point works itself out in individual poems, either in subsequent es- says by Riede or others. Like Riede, John Coyle and Richard Cronin in "Tennyson and the Apostles" {Rethinking Victorian Culture, ed. Julie John and Alice Jenkins [Macmillan] ) seek the crux of Tennyson's career and poetic authority in the poet's formative years. But Coyle and Cronin (as might be expected from Cronin's earlier work) focus not on the global macropolitics of Vic- torian imperialism but on the local, on Tennyson's relationship to the radical political agenda of the Cambridge Apostles prior to their disas- trous Spanish expedition. Coyle and Cronin's conclusion is not new, for</page><page sequence="89">LINDA K. HUGHES / 501 it echoes J. S. Mill's contention that the poet speaks to himself but is overheard by others (a compromise position that frees the poet from hav- ing to choose between private and public); their means to this end, how- ever, is fresh and spirited. Tennyson's move from Somersby to Cam- bridge, from an enclosed poetic world to a public arena, and from this public space to a mediate borderland, becomes something of a master narrative. Whereas "Lines on Cambridge of 1830," like Arthur Hallam's contemporaneous (Apostolic) critique of imperial ambition in "Timbuctoo," attacked the status quo for its elitist power and exclusion of others (such as Catholics and dissenters), "The Palace of Art" abandoned any direct call for reform in favor of an aesthetically distanced revisiting of the is- sues. As Coyle and Cronin observe, the palace's architecture and depopu- lated, art-filled rooms recall the Great Court and halls of Trinity College; the poem implies hope that in future the soul might return in company with the many rather than the elite few; and the soul's duration in the palace is coincident with that of Trinity undergraduates. But the poem's defining moment remains the soul's suspension between stagnant, inward isolation and a hostile world without, suggesting by analogy a poet who occupies a mobile periphery rather than locating himself in a fixed (po- litical) terrain. In such work, Coyle and Cronin argue, Tennyson helped shape the assumption that poets could speak to the age on condition that they "maintain[ed] themselves at a remove both from their audience and from their times" (p. 123). Placing oneself in a local terrain is also at issue in Irene B. Beesemyer's "'Black with the void from which God himself has disappeared': Spatial Displacement in Tennyson's Maud" (TRB 7, no. 4: 174-192). Beesemyer demonstrates the implacable homelessness confronting the speaker, his inability to find identity (or repose) because all sites in the poem are already filled with menacing presences, whether malicious owners and citizens or merely dire semiotic portents. Only the meadow is a safe, nearly paradisal site, yet it is a passageway rather than a place. The speaker's putative solution is to declare himself "one with my kind" on the deck of a ship, a small, transitory site that offers no rooted place but only pas- sage - to the Crimea, itself a site of repellent horror and homelessness for British soldiers. Beesemyer places her exploration of homelessness in the context of unstable class identity when land ownership was being over- taken by commodification (though she does not specify the relevance to Tennyson himself, a middle-class man of letters, albeit one who had just invested in property at Farringford). Domestic relations within homes are the focus of two essays by Alisa Clapp-Itnyre and Marion Shaw. In "Marginalized Musical Inter- ludes: Tennyson's Critique of Conventionality in The Princess" (VP 38</page><page sequence="90">502 I VICTORIAN POETRY [2000]: 227-248), Clapp-Itnyre reads Tennyson's gender politics in pro- gressive terms by taking seriously both Tennyson's dramatic apparatus and his stated rationale for interpolating lyrics. Rather than attaining am- biguous status within the narrative, according to Clapp-Itnyre, Ida is per- sistently parodied by masculine narrators who assign silly rhetoric to this tyro female rhetor. The undergraduate narrators also reductively align women with children, implying that the attempt to integrate children with advanced studies (as with Psyche's child) subverts women's futile attempt at higher education and produces childish spats between women. In contrast, the interpolated lyrics sung by women, which Tennyson said were added to clarify the poem's point, offer a more complex, socially engaged, and realistic portrayal of women's condition and hopes. The first lyric ("As through the land at eve we went") shows a quarrelling couple rather than idealized husband and spouse; and when they are rec- onciled by coming upon the grave of their dead child the man expresses grief commensurate with the woman's, registering masculine participa- tion in domesticity. The problem of working-class poverty also surfaces in this lyric, which Clapp-Itnyre reads as a more sensitive response to the workers attending the Mechanics Institute at Sir Walter's than the uni- versity men's indifference to them. Clapp-Itnyre's analysis of other lyrics is similarly illuminating, as is her observation that the issues they raise (women's need for agency apart from men, men's sharing in domestic roles, women's alignment with the unempowered poor, and their hope to effect lasting influence through their art) were central to early nineteenth- century feminist thought - with which the lyrics are consistent. Only at the aesthetic level do I hesitate at Clapp-Itnyre's argument: sexist though the masculine narrators be, their "Tears, Idle Tears" has an aesthetic power missing in "Sweet and Low," and I find narrative hostility to Ida less absolute than Clapp-Itnyre does. Still, her engaging, original consider- ation of the poem merits wide attention. Marion Shaw's essay on "Tennyson's Marriages" (CrSurv 11, no. 3 [1999]: 21-29) opens - deceptively - as a chat about Tennyson's relation- ship with Emily Sellwood and the marriage that brought fulfillment to his life. The article is in fact a probing meditation on a text's relation to biographical experience and an era's dominant discourses. In Tennyson's early career, a period of sometimes anguishing loneliness, poems such as "The Miller's Daughter" suggest that marriage can overcome class differ- ences to create a lifelong loving bond; if marriage fails in these works, it results from blocking agents who use marriage to secure financial or social advantage. After Tennyson's marriage, apparently a successful if hardly ideal union, his depiction of marriage darkens: Guinevere is unfaithful and destroys a kingdom, while thwarted marriage in "Aylmer's Field" de-</page><page sequence="91">LINDA K. HUGHES I 503 stroys lovers and a dynastic line. Struck by the inverse relation between Tennyson's personal life and his representations of marriage, Shaw sug- gests that surrounding discourses on marriage have more to do with the poems than Tennyson's personal history- At mid-century marriage was being idealized by novelists (Charlotte Bronte, Gaskell) and poets (Patmore, Clough) as a means of healing social rifts, but after the Divorce Act of 1857, which acknowledged that marriage could go drastically wrong, and Darwin's 1859 Origin of Species, marriage was very differently imagined in Gaskell's Sylvia s Lovers, Eliot's hliddlemarch, and Meredith's Modern Love, with Tennyson following suit. Another cluster of essays in 2000 focuses on Tennyson's classical poems. In "Tennyson and Ulysses Becoming a Name" (TRB 7, no. 4: 165- 173), Erik Gray revises revisionism, as it were. Noting the persistent tendency among even postmodernist critics to link the poems to the poet, Gray sets out (pace Marion Shaw) to seek evidence of a centered self in Tennyson's work. Whereas in the notoriously complex work of Browning adjectives tend to modulate into verbs - entirely appropriate for a poet to whom to utter a self is to create a self - in Tennyson adjectives often modulate into nouns, "attributes" into "essences." Ulysses' farewell to Ithaca is Gray's case in point: The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep Moans round with many voices. The adjective-noun- verb patterns of the first two clauses seem to require that "deep" be read as an adjective. The line break - the margin - colludes with Tennyson's poetic patterning to create a moment of doubt and then transformation as an apparent adjective (an attribute) becomes the object (or essence) it at first seemed to modify. Similarly, process (in life and poetry) can also become a completed achievement (a self, a poem). While "I am become a name" might suggest fame or alienation from a prior identity, the third possibility, according to Gray, is Ulysses' assertion that by appropriate action and valor one may earn the name one has been given, becoming that self. While the brevity of Gray's essay means that such a far-reaching assertion is provisional, his intriguing analysis opens up possible avenues for further study. Richard Marggraf Turley takes a historicist approach to language in "'Knowledge of their own supremacy': 'Oenone' and the Standardization of Tennyson's Diction" (VP 37 [1999]: 291-308). Though the inspiration of his investigation - minor changes in the text of Tennyson's 1832 "Oenone" by other writers in 1841 and 1842 - limits Turley 's scope, his essay follows Donald Hair's work in demonstrating that concern over Tennyson's unhyphenated compounds intersected with nineteenth-cen-</page><page sequence="92">504 I VICTORIAN POETRY tury linguistics, particularly the German contention that linguistic de- cline signals (or even leads to) cultural and national decline. Two essays address Tennyson's classical sources. In a brief note ("Tennyson's 'Ulysses' and 'Lotos-Eaters': Sources in Virgil's Aeneid V," N&amp;Q n.s. 46 [March 1999]: 60-62) Adam Roberts argues that Virgil's Book 5, in which Iris appears to Trojan women and incites them to rebel against the need of going forward on the quest to Italy, is a key passage for Tennyson. While his evidence linking Book 5 to "Ulysses" seems tenu- ous, Roberts is excellent on "The Lotos Eaters." Here, in addition to the general logic that Virgil's revision of Homer would have come to mind as Tennyson composed his own Homeric supplement, there is strong con- gruence of details between Tennyson's exhausted mariners and the Trojan women exiles who speak in one voice, gaze on the sea, and express their profound weariness at having to move forward. Two Virgilian details Roberts does not mention amplify his case. In the same episode Aeneas' son springs into energetic action when the women exiles set fire to Trojan ships, his will, energy, and leadership forming a compelling contrast to the women's desire to cease from wandering, just as Ulysses' masculine "'Forward!'" at the head of Tennyson's poem contrasts with the passive, feminized sailors who follow. That the voyages of the Trojans and Ulysses converge in the Aeneid when the Trojans land on the same isle of Cyclops recently visited by Ulysses strengthens the credibility that Tennyson would draw on the Virgilian epic to augment an episode from the Odyssey. In "Tennyson's Classical Dramatic Monologues and the Approxima- tion of Greek and Latin Poetry" (VRev 25, no.l [Summer 1999]: 35-49), A. A. Markley asserts that, beyond adopting tropes, selected details, even sound effects and rhythms in classical precedents, Tennyson recreated the experience of reading classical poems by reviving classical allusion. Rather than ad hoc reference to underscore a particular theme or image, classical allusion often worked to create a complex web of interrelated citations that telescoped entire mythic histories into compressed space. The allu- sions Markley identifies in "Tiresias" to Euripides, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Callimachus work collectively to glance backward to Ares' perennial rage against Thebes because of its founder, to Tiresias' past blinding, and to the immediate cause of war against Thebes in Oedipus' sin against the gods and his sons' battle for power. A similar network of allusion operates in "Oenone." As Markley observes, "Oenone" and "Tiresias" have gar- nered less critical esteem than other classical monologues, but it was in these two that Tennyson most fully recreated the effect of reading classi- cal literature. Markley's analysis revisits the degree to which Tennyson designed some poems for an elite audience whose insider knowledge en- abled them to see patterns veiled to ordinary readers, just as Andrew</page><page sequence="93">LINDA K. HUGHES I 505 Elfenbein has argued that only Apostles could fully register the personal significance of "The Lady of Shalott." In identifying allusions embedded in these two classical poems, Markley also gives scholars tools to consider anew whether, once the allusions are visible, "Oenone" and "Tiresias" emerge as shimmering, resonant poems rather than labored verse. Markley 's "Finding the Modern Frames in Tennyson's Final Classical Poems" (PQ 78, no. 4 [Fall 1999]: 453476) persuasively suggests that the three dedicatory poems of "Tiresias," "Demeter and Persephone," and "The Death of Oenone" model the stances readers should adopt in order most richly to understand the accompanying poems. The dedication to FitzGerald, for example, suggests Tennyson's address of "Tiresias" to those readers who know something of translating past literary works into a con- temporary idiom. Markley also makes a strong case for the modernity of treatment in "The Death of Oenone"; in contrast to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Tennyson features an Oenone thinking back to past happy union with Paris, so that her jumping onto the pyre may not be self-punishing suicide so much as longed-for reunion. Yet neither, Markley cautions, should we read her self-destruction uncritically, since irony may be as germane here as in "Ulysses." If we connect Markley's analysis to Marion Shaw's, "The Death of Oenone" might seem more modern still, since the title poem of his posthumous volume appeared in the wake of the marriage debates sparked by Mona Caird and the Daily Telegraph's "Is Marriage a Failure?" campaign in 1888. Tennyson's relation to modernity also surfaces in a final cluster of essays that link Tennyson to later writers. Michael Slater's Tennyson Society monograph, Tennyson in the Theatre, notes the appropriation of Tennyson's The Cup by fin-de-siecle aestheticism through the starring roles taken by actresses Ellen Terry and Ada Rehan, lavish costumes, and the staging's spectacular ritual and archaeologically correct classical set- tings - with Terry's performance inspiring Oscar Wilde's poem "Camma." "The Lady and Gentleman of Shalott: The Early Poems of Elizabeth Bishop" (CrSurv 11, no. 3 [1999]: 85-91), by Anne Stevenson, is focused on Bishop but notes the resource as well as target Tennyson offered to Bishop in "The Gentleman of Shalott." If Bishop's poem critiqued the implied limits imposed on female imagination in Tennyson, "The Lady of Shalott" provided a metaphor by which Bishop could think through her reluctance to face or admit personal elements into her poems of the 1930s. In Bishop's poem, the gentleman's division is between the conscious and unconscious, with a spinal mirror bisecting his double self: as long as the two sides are perfectly aligned all is well, but he rests with the uneasy notion that one half of himself is merely a reflecting surface. Kathleen Coyne Kelly's analysis of Thomas Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49 and Roger</page><page sequence="94">506 / VICTORIAN POETRY Zelazny 's "He Who Shapes" from Dream Shaper is also relevant here ("The Lady of Shalott: Malory, Tennyson, Zelazny and Pynchon," Modern Retellings ofChivalric Texts, ed. Gloria Allaire [Ashgate, 1999]). In Zelazny, the blind Eileen Shallot comes to Charles Render for assistance in visual dreaming but ends up taking control when their subjectivities blend, so that at the end of the novella Render is lost in a permanent dream world and Eileen is the only one able to speak. A. S. Byatt, in "Ice, Snow, Glass" (On Histories and Stories: Selected Essays [Chatto &amp; Windus]), in- cludes "The Lady of Shalott" among Northern European variants of "The Glass Coffin," "Snow White," and "The Snow Queen" and remarks on the poem's importance to her as an aspiring writer: "I must have known it by heart as a small girl, since we had a colouring book with the poem and pages of pre-Raphaelite images to colour in. ... [The Lady] is 'half- sick of shadows,' which as a girl I always took to be a reflection of the sense that the life of books was more real and brighter than the everyday, but ought not to be" (p. 157). The year 2000 was a productive one in Tennyson studies. The clus- ters of work I have surveyed establish Tennyson's connection back to the classical era, forward to modern and postmodern writers, with a rich field of inquiry in between.</page></plain_text>
