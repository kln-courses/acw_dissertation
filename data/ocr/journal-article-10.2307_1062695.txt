<plain_text><page sequence="1">Whalen Lai UNMASKING THE FILIAL SAGE-KING SHUN: OEDIPUS AT ANYANG The official history of China as told in the Confucian classic, the Book of History, begins its account with the legendary reigns of sage-kings Yao, Shun, and Yii.1 In recognition of the principle that virtue should reign, Yao voluntarily abdicated to Shun, Shun voluntarily abdicated to Yii, and Yti intended to do the same by passing the throne on to Yi. But as it happened, Ch'i, the son of Yti, succeeded his father. Thus the era of voluntary abdication gave way to the first of the three dynasties: Hsia, Shang, and Chou. Despite the hereditary rules and the privatization of the realm (ssu t'ien-hsia), the prior ideal that virtue reigns did not entirely end. A num- ber of righteous men were appointed to high office, usually at the begin- ning of these dynasties. The last of these who held high office in Chou, and also the best remembered, was the duke of Chou, brother of the founding ruler, who assumed the reign as regent when the heir was too young to rule. The duke's regency marked the high point of Chou achievement: he instituted the rule of Rites and Music, to which Con- fucius would later look as a model answer to the problem of chaos.2 The three dynasties are official history. Archaeology confirmed the Shang by unearthing Anyang, its capital. But the Hsia and the reigns of Yao, Shun, and Yii are probably mythical. The three sage-kings are ideal philosopher-kings, probably the creations of the classical philosophers 1 James Legge, trans., The Shoo King of Historical Documents, vol. 3 of The Book of Chinese Classics (Taipei: Southern Materials Center, 1985). 2 Confucius: The Analects, trans.

It is not clear how this idyllic prehistory came to be compiled. Mo-tzu or the Mohists may have started it by idealizing Yti of Hsia, placing his dynasty before the one that Confucians prized (i.e., the Chou) and the one the Chou had maligned (i.e., the Shang). Yu was the Mohist hero who worked for the good of the people so much that he neglected to enter his own home, although he passed by its door three times during his Herculean labor to stem the Great Flood.3 To counteract the Mohists, Confucians idealized Yii's predecessor Shun and made him the paragon of filial piety. He was so devoted to his family that he changed the heart of his once evil stepfather, the Blind Man, and his half brother, Hsiang, when the two together had twice plotted his death. By restoring harmony to the family, Shun went on, as the Great Learning put it, to "order the state and pacify all under heaven." Shun's filial piety was probably first valorized by Mencius, since the Analects of Confucius does not seem to know of it.4 The present article analyzes the myths of Shun's legendary filial piety and is based on the early records and a rich account of tensions pre- served in Mencius. Shun is the Chinese counterpoint to Oedipus who, by killing his father Laius, bequeathed to the West the pattern of Oedipal rebellion. Shun never raised a finger against the Blind Man, thus be- queathing to China the pattern of canonized filial piety and compliance with patriarchy. Or is that so? That question will lead us through the many-layered myths and history of early China. I. THE OFFICIAL STORY OF SHUN We will begin with the official story of Shun and then consider a very different, unofficial story. We will trace Shun's origin, career, and move- ment; the two attempts on his life by his father and his brother; and his reactions to their treachery.5 3 See Whalen Lai, "A Brief Note: Who Used the Term 'Sage-King' First?" Ching Feng 27, no. 4 (1985): 204-8. Technically, Mo-tzu did. 4 Analects, 12.22, is the most informative, for it mentions Shun's appointment of Kao Yao. Details found in the last chapter (21.1) may not be original. This could be a chapter added later by the Mencian editor. 5 See Sarah Allan, The Heir and the Sage (San Francisco: Chinese Material Center, 1981), pp. 27-54. The Mencian discussion on Shun is mostly in Mencius, trans. D. C. Lau (Middlesex: Penquin, 1970), 5A.1-7. Ann Birrell's Chinese Mythology: An Introduction (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1993)-which I just came across-will be an important reference work, although its coverage on Shun is minimal. Yuan K'o (Yuan Ke), the Chinese authority on these myths, now has a book in English (Dragons and Dy- nasties: An Introduction to Chinese Mythology [London: Penguin, 1993]) that covers Shun (pp. 68-73). These retellings, first published in Peking by the Foreign Languages Press for popular consumption, are poor substitutes for Yuan K'o's better researched and anno- tated works. 164</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions Shun's origin and movement. Like the sage-kings Yao and Yii before and after him, Shun had (or was given by his authors) very humble ori- gins. The sage-king legends are antiaristocratic and paint a utopian picture of open access to the throne for the good and the lowly. (Mo- tzu favored this especially.) The myth of Shun's background seems less contrived than those of Yao and yi.6 Shun is said to be a farmer, a fisherman, or a potter. He is also said to be a eastern barbarian, a Tung I. These attributes are not accidental. China regarded itself to be the central kingdom with two ranges of barbarians on four sides. The outer range, or set, is the truly barbaric; the inner range came under the Chinese family of nations. I belongs to the inner set and has special affinity with the later Chinese culture, which is regarded as a syntheses of the I tribes to the east, who were called "bar- barians," and the Hsia to the west, who are the source of central Chinese culture. Hsia, associated with Anyang and the river culture, is basically agrarian, while I, near the coastal area, is tied to a nomadic and fishing culture (see fig. 1). Sage-king Yu, or Hsia Yti, is a dragon, a fish (yii), perhaps the totem of tribes to the east, near the delta, or further south.7 That Shun was both fisherman and farmer fits the structuralist correlation of east and west with agriculture and herding, the two livelihoods and ma- jor components of Chinese culture. It also matches Shun's biography, for he was born in the east at Chu Feng, moved west to Fu Hsia, and died while on an imperial tour in the south, where he was buried at Ming T'iao (see fig. 1). A number of rulers, sages, and ministers in early Chinese his- tory (from Yao, Shun, and Yii to Hsia, Shang, and Chou) retired (or were exiled) to the south. This is more than a natural, geopolitical choice: the one direction Shun was not associated with, the rather bleak north, was not the direction of Chinese culture's outreach and was virtually tabooed, for reasons that we will consider later. The story is that Shun moved from east to west after Yao had discov- ered Shun in the fields and recognized him as the next sage to be king. There is a reference to Shun weeping in the fields. Weeping is a sign of mourning,8 but the standard (Mencian) explanation is that Shun grieved at not being able to find a way to please his parents. Nothing Shun did could please the Blind Man, his father. Even the favor that Yao showered 6 Allan, Heir and the Sage, pp. 27-54. On Mo-tzu's view, See pp. 125-29. 7 On the connection between Yu and fish, see Whalen Lai, "Symbolism of Evil in China: The K'ung-chia Myth Analyzed," History of Religions 23, no. 4 (1984): 316- 43. I drew on the scholarship of Mori Yasutaro, Chung-kuo ku-tai shen-hua yen-chiu, trans. Wang Hsiao-lien (Taipei: Ti-p'ing-hsien, 1974). Allan associates fish, snakes, and tortoises with Hsia emblems demoted by Shang to the subterranean waters (see Sarah Allan, The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China [Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991]). 8 Normally, one would associate mourning with autumn, but later in this article I will place the incident in spring. See Mencius, 5A.1, where the tears are accompanied by Shun's alleged plea to heaven. I take that to be a later accretion. 165</page><page sequence="4">Oedipus at Anyang North Archer Farmer Fisherman of West ---_---_-_-- - East of land water South FIG. 1.-The movement of Shun on Shun-even beyond high office-meant nothing to the stubborn old man. But Yao was so pleased with Shun that he sent nine of his sons to attend him and gave his two daughters to Shun in a double marriage. Mencius was asked why Shun did not inform the Blind Man of his marriage, since it was highly improper for a son to contract a marriage by himself without informing his parents. Mencius had to explain it away by arguing that Shun knew how the Blind Man would object.9 Confucius in the Analects showed no knowledge of any of this, but he did remember that Shun sat facing south and the country just fell into place. A lot has been made of this line in the Analects, such as the belief that the king was immovable like the North Star.10 But there is no mys- tery involved. Basically, it has to do with the power of rites. In the Chinese court, the Son of Heaven sits facing south while the ministers bow to him facing north. So, too, when a Chinese family is in harmony, 9 Mencius, 5A.2. Shun married in secret because marriage is seen as part of his first filial duty, which is to secure an offspring for the family line. 10 On Shun's facing south, see Analects, 15.5. This image of his nonaction has been compared to the motionless constancy of the North Star, also said to be the court of the ancestors. 166</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions the father takes his seat at the head of the table every night facing south, and the rank and file of his offspring fall into place in perfect harmony. Both ruler and father sit in the center, facing the sunny south with their backs to the north, the direction of death. There is in the Shun material a curious reference to both Yao and the Blind Man facing north as Shun faced south. This is a problem for Shun apologists, since it means that Shun somehow took over the reign (the throne) during the lifetime of Yao. The ordeals of Shun. As a family drama, Shun's ordeal is that of a son born into the worst type of family relationship possible but some- how able to triumph and to change it for the better. After harmonizing his family, Shun extended his "graded love" bit by bit, Mencian style, to pacifying the whole realm."'l Shun had to deal with an uncaring father, the Blind Man; a foolish mother (not a central figure); and fierce sibling rivalry from his brother Hsiang (whose name means literally "elephant"). To make the conflict seem more plausible, the Blind Man is sometimes said to be Shun's step- father and Hsiang his younger half-brother.12 This pair tried to kill Shun: Shun's parent sent him to repair the barn. Then they removed the ladder and the Blind Man set fire to the barn. They sent Shun to dredge the well, and then set out after him and blocked up the well over him.13 Shun escaped the fire by using two bamboo hats as wings and flying to safety. He got out of the well by discovering a secret passageway. Hsiang was unaware that Shun had not been killed. He gloated over his dastardly deed: "The credit of plotting against the life of Shun goes to me. The cattle and sheep go to you, father and mother, and the gran- aries as well. But the bow goes to me and the lute and the ti bow as well. His two wives should also be made to look after my quarters."14 This passage from Mencius is composed in an archaic (some say a mock archaic) style. The cattle and sheep and the bow (and arrow) recall the legacy of the nomadic I, the grain in the granaries the legacy of the ag- rarian Hsia. Hsiang was after the properties of Shun, who ruled these two regions. We will later note the southern association of the two wives and the lute. 1 "Once the Blind Man was pleased, the pattern of relationship between father and son in the Empire was set" (Mencius, 4A.28). On graded love see my reading of Mencius' debate with Yi Chih in Whalen Lai, "In Defense of Graded Love: Three Parables from Mencius," Asian Philosophy 1, no. 1 (1991): 51-60. 12 In accordance with the popular perception of the evil stepmother, the Blind Man is alleged to be a stepfather instead of simply father. That is not in Mencius, and the emen- dation is not necessary; see my later discussion on matrilocal marriage. 13 Mencius, 5A.2. The summary is abridged from Lau's app. 4, "Ancient History as Understood by Mencius" (p. 226). 14 Mencius, 5A.2. 167</page><page sequence="6">Oedipus at Anyang Shun's magnanimity. Hsiang was unprepared for what he would see when he went to Shun's residence. Far from being dead, Shun was alive and well, calmly playing on his lute as if nothing had happened. In the official account, Shun demonstrated his legendary filial love and broth- erly concern. He bore no grudge against his father but served the Blind Man with devotion (observed Mencius) until the old man became more amiable. He also forgave his younger brother. (As the son, Shun could not chastise his father, but as the elder brother, he could take some ac- tion against Hsiang.) This is the exchange reported in Mencius when Hsiang found Shun to be alive: Hsiang: "I was just now thinking of you." Shun: "I too was just thinking about my subject."15 With that, Shun delegated his brother Hsiang (Elephant) to rule over the district of Yu Pi (literally, "have nose") in the south. The reference to a kingdom of beings known for having distinctive noses (elephant trunks) points to the fact that the name Elephant was no accident. Hsiang was the totem or the totemic head of an elephant clan in the south, the direction that Shun faced and the direction where Shun died while on tour. Before coming back to a structuralist analysis of the Shun legends as a tale of two cities (Hsia and I) and a circular movement (east to west and back), we will have to take a detour through, of all things, Oedipus Rex. II. THE UNOFFICIAL STORY Every culture has its national myth. Greece has a patricidal Oedipus; Confucian China celebrates a filially pious Shun instead. But before we go too far in drawing that either/or contrast, we have to look at an unofficial account of China's early history. The official account has Yao, Shun, and Yi voluntarily passing the reign not to the crown prince and heir but to a sage. But there is a rather different unofficial account, told in the Bamboo Annals, an ancient text that was once lost.16 There, Shun is said to have imprisoned Yao in the hills. In turn, Shun was imprisoned by Yi. Neither waits for the volun- tary abdication of the preceding sage-king; both of them usurp the rule 15 Mencius, 5A.2. 16 The Bamboo Annals was once thought to have been lost in the burning of books under the First Emperor but was retrieved when one copy, buried in the third century B.C., was found. Some see it as providing the more authentic, earlier account (see the discus- sion in Legge [n. 1 above], pp. 105-83; Allan, Heir and the Sage [n. 5 above], pp. 136- 39; Lau, trans., Mencius, p. 224). Allan ties the Bamboo Annals to the Han-fei-tzu, com- piled at the end of the same century that this work was buried. She sees it as being influenced by legalist realism and thus dates it as a third-century B.C. text (see Allan, Heir and the Sage, p. 138n). See my disagreement below. 168</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions before their time. This corresponds to the indirect reference, among Mencius' contemporaries, to Shun facing south while Yao faced north as if he were a subject. There are other discrepancies. According to the official account in the Book of History, Yu intended Yi to succeed him, but his own son Ch'i assumed rule instead. Mo-tzu did not challenge that right of succession. Mencius even offered this justification: the feudal princes went for coun- sel to Ch'i instead of to Yi, and heaven approved the people's choice as its mandate.17 But according to the Bamboo Annals, Ch'i took over the reign and put Yi to death. That might appear unnecessarily cruel until we notice a recurrent pattern in these early successions. For example, the Book of History recounts how the founding emperor of the Shang, T'ang, had an able minister named Yi Yin, who acted as an advisor to the young heir, T'ai Chia. Because T'ai Chia went against the law of T'ang, Yi Yin exiled him until he reformed his ways and then restored him to the throne. But the Bamboo Annals tells it differently: Yi Yin usurped the throne and banished the crown prince, who returned secretly to the capital to kill Yi Yin and regain the throne. This account of T'ai Chia's killing Yi Yin during the Shang replicates Ch'i's earlier kill- ing of Yi during the Hsia. Thus history-or, rather, myth-repeats itself.18 Both incidents point to the historical problematic of the regency of the duke of Chou. Although the duke never usurped the throne from his young protege, King Wu, even the Han Confucian allowed that the man- date of heaven-the right to rule-was actually passed to the duke. From him, the mandate is said to have been passed to Confucius, the un- crowned king of the spring and autumn era.19 Behind all these legends of sage and heir is a perceived crisis of succes- sion. Should kingship be based on blood or on virtue? Should the throne be passed to the heir or the sage? Those who prefer sages to be kings often remember the heir apparent as evil. Those who prefer to have one royal bloodline on the throne consider powerful advisors, ministers, regents to be potential regicides-and best removed. On this dialectic laid out for China's early reigns, both structurally and case by case, we have Sarah Allan's (University of London) book titled The Heir and the Sage.20 Allan regards this ancient tension to be ancient and real, to have institutional 17 For Mencius' view on succession, see Mencius, 5A.5, 6. For Mo-tzu, see Allan, Heir and the Sage, pp. 125-28; for Mencius, see pp. 131-33. 18 For detailed structural comparisons of this and other parallels, see Allan, Heir and the Sage, where they are too detailed to cite and far too many to even summarize. 19 This Han view of Confucius as an uncrowned king is basic to the New Yext school of Tung Chung-shu. Sung Neoconfucians went one step further and had the Tao (instead of the mandate) going from the duke to Confucian and on to the Sung masters. 20 The full dialectical drama involves the existing ruler on the throne, his son (good or bad), a prime minister (advisory or usurping, ready to serve or refusing, i.e., a recluse), 169</page><page sequence="8">Oedipus at Anyang base, and to be destined to inform the political culture of the Han when Confucian scholars gave advice and consent at the emperor's court. Our focus in this study is, in one sense, narrower, limited to the filial tale of Shun, which Allan does not include in her survey of crisis in suc- cession. But a simple structuralist correlation shows how the family drama is a variant of the political drama or how both are variants of a still larger myth. To see that, we will first collapse Yao and the Blind Man-Shun's political patron and his biological father-into a single person. This is not an arbitrary move, because these fragments suggest that we are dealing with one person: Shun imprisoned Yao in the hills for three years; Shun sat in judgment of the Blind Man; Shun faced south as Yao faced north; and Shun faced south as the Blind Man faced north. The first two items show Shun asserting his authority over the pair, and the latter two depict Yao and the Blind Man both bowing to him. We will explain the imprisonment and the bowing presently. If Yao and the Blind Man are two faces of one reality, then we can understand why the appointment of Shun by Yao as his successor (sage to sage) would rub against the Blind Man's preference to make Hsiang his heir (father to son). Once moral authority and naked power (Yao/ Blind Man) were so divided among the two recipients, a widening gulf divided the two ends.21 The growing tension is represented in figure 2 by the widening gap between the left, which represents moral authority (Sage), and the right, which represents political power (Heir). Reading down the columns of the figure, we find at first increasing antagonism between the left and the right sides. At the third tier down, the Blind Man plotted the death of Shun on one end, and Shun imprisoned Yao on the other. Matters got worse at the next level, with Hsiang throwing stones after sending Shun down the well (nowadays, a Chinese proverb for dou- ble malice). Shun would take his revenge by exiling Hsiang to the south. But there is a concluding irony. The south is often the direction where sages retire as well as where criminals are exiled. But if Hsiang was exiled (from home) there, Shun himself also died on tour (away from home) there. So the diagram ends with a Levi-Straussian suggestion: that just as Yao and the Blind Man-authority and power-were a single Janus, Shun and Hsiang may have been another such ambiguous pair. and modes of appointment (from above or below, with or without heaven's consent, natu- rally or supernaturally). 21 All political rule requires both power and legitimacy: power is the first step in the founding of rule and the final resort in holding on to it, but legitimacy, or an appeal to a right to rule (here, moral authority), is essential to its everyday sustenance. Allan's study focuses on the politics of succession and does not deal with Shun's family conflict (see Allan, Heir and the Sage, pp. 37-39). She missed seeing the political parallels. The Bam- boo Annals also skirted this seemingly nonpolitical part of Shun's life. 170</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions North Yao alias Blind Man Shun as sage Hsiang as heir Shun against Yao Blind Man against Shun Shun against Hsiang Hsiang against Shun Shun died on tour Hsiang in exile Shun alias Hsiang South FIG. 2.-Crisis of succession: sage versus heir III. WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH? The presence of a political conflict between heir and sage that lurks behind the sibling rivalry between Hsiang and Shun raises a question. Which of the two versions of the sage-kings or of Shun himself is the true one? Was Shun always filial, as the official version has it now, or was he not a potential Oedipus at Anyang? The answer turns out to be much more complicated than a simple yes or no. Even in the Book of History, the various sages and founding kings did not reign simply by virtue, nor was the actual succession of reign ever bloodless. Might and right were not mutually exclusive. Beginning with Yao and continuing all the way down to the duke of Chou, all the men of virtue dealt with unrepenting enemies with a strong hand. First came the sword; only then came the pen, or, rather, the brush-namely, culture's art of peace. Allan sides with the official rather than the unofficial history of early China. She judges the variant in the Bamboo Annals to be so akin to Han Fei-tzu's view of history that it should be better regarded as a later, legalist redaction. The legalists were Machiavellians who banked on the use of political might, while the Confucians trusted in the right due to virtue. But there is a problem in placing the Confucian memory ahead of the legalist one. As we will see with the Shun material, two different images of Shun existed and are preserved in the single record of the Mencius. The realist account is not visibly any earlier or more original that the idealist account. A critic of tradition can just as well argue that the Bamboo Annals contained the original story, which the Confucians rewrote, and that the Book of History was canonized in Han while the Bamboo Annals was 171</page><page sequence="10">Oedipus at Anyang supplanted. The textual evidence of the pros and the cons in this debate is as yet not hard and fast. To debunk tradition and put the Bamboo An- nals first is an academic iconoclasm that is not without its problems. It is better to accept the pluralistic alternative-namely, that both versions existed side by side at the time of Mencius, who only de- fended (rather than innovated) one reading while his opponents recalled another. Which came first, the chicken or the egg, may be a futile ques- tion. Before the Chou enlightenment acknowledged the discrepancy between the moral mandate of heaven and the immoral heir on the throne, the memory of things past was probably "pre-moral."22 Virtue (te) was then power, and power presumes authority (from heaven). It is unlikely that any early historiography would sing only a realist tale or an idealist one. If we push that argument further, we will have to admit that the proto- Confucian and the protolegalist options were not alone, in nuce, in the early narratives. The proto-Taoist option must also have existed in some seminal form. The Confucian glorifies the sages (virtue), the legalist the heirs (power), and the Taoist would have neither, instead idealizing the hermit, who preferred to be left alone and who refused high office when it was offered to him. This trio of options-to actualize virtue, to max- imize power, or to withdraw from all entanglement-remain real, human options in China to this day, and there is no reason not to believe they were not real options long ago, that only became codified into a code of philosophical behavior later. Accepting that pluralism of readings, let us consider the two options that are now preserved in Mencius. Mencius himself defended the Confucian option: Shun the sage and king brought peace simply by being filially pious and, even when he was in high office, never put his family second. Hsien-ch'iu Meng disagreed, quoting this saying: A man of abundant virtue Cannot be treated as subject by his prince Nor can he be treated as a son by his father. He held that since Shun was already promoted to high office on ac- count of his virtue, the Blind Man should defer to him, as Yao would. Did not Yao and the Blind Man face north while Shun faced south? Is there not this other reference to Shun looking at the Blind Man with a look of distress?23 In the first instance, Shun apparently received hom- 22 Arthur Waley, trans., The Way and Its Power, by Lao-tzu (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1934), pp. 31-32. In the introduction, Waley writes about te as a premoral category like mana. Although a bit dated, the category of the premoral is still viable. When the leap of being (into moral society) is supposed to have occurred in China is debatable: Was it with Chou? Or with Confucius? 23 For a taste of the hermeneutics used in reading The Chinese Classics to support an argument, see Mencius, 5A.4. It is not our kind of neutral logicohistorical method. Some 172</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions age from both Yao and the Blind Man. In the second, Shun as a magis- trate was either displeased with the Blind Man or suffered under the dilemma of having to pass judgment on his evil father. Lacking context for these cryptic remarks, both Mencius and Hsien- ch'iu Meng were trying to make sense of some fragmented myth. I believe that Shun's looking with distress at the Blind Man is the coun- terweight to Yao's finding Shun crying in the field. The first had to do with Yao electing (elevating) Shun, and the second had to do with Shun judging (putting down) the Blind Man. Neither originally had anything to do with offering or carrying out political office. Hsien-ch'iu Meng took the latter to mean that Shun was carrying out his office, while Mencius argued that Shun never upstaged Yao and would never presume to judge his father. "Shun would rather resign from office and carry his father on his back to some distant shore (site of retirement)."24 The idea that Shun would even summon the Blind Man to court, that is, to his presence, is abhorrent to Mencius. (A magistrate could summon an under- ling, but sons are supposed to pay their respects to their parents by going to the latter's residence.) Mencius only remembered Shun's serving the Blind Man with utmost respect until, touched by his piety, the Blind Man became amendable. Mencius's assertions may have been reasonable enough to satisfy Meng, but another contemporary, Wan Chang, apparently would not ac- cept Mencius's account. He cited verbatim the archaic oration of Hsiang in which he boasted of his crime and proceeded to divide Shun's prop- erty. Wan Chang included in his citation the following exchange: Hsiang: "I was just now thinking of you." Shun: "I too was just thinking about my subject." He interpreted Hsiang's words to be false piety and Shun's words to be a master stroke of irony. By referring to his brother as "my subject," Shun was putting Hsiang in his place. Seeing through Hsiang's feigned concern, Shun exiled Hsiang to the south.25 As the fragments stand, it is hard to see how Wan Chang could be wrong. passages Mencius cited from the Book of History may be from chapters now lost. Or it could be that the texts, available only in terse entries, were then still being compiled and creatively interpreted. 24 On how Shun would react if the Blind Man had killed a man, see Mencius, 7A.35. To carry one's father on one's back-to toil like an animal-is a symbolic act of filial pi- ety. That son and father should retire "to the edge of the sea" and live ever happily after puts Shun again in the east, the area of Ch'i. In a defense of the right view of the gentle- men, Mencius 5A.4, associates the improper reading with the "rustic [barbarian] from eastern Ch'i, also the home of Taoists. The eastern rustic took Yao's facing north and Shun's looking with distress at his father to mean that Shun judged his elders. 25 Mencius, 5A.3. The passage, presumably from the Book of History and cited by Men- cius to support his contention, is ambiguous. It identities Yu Pi (the place) with Hsiang (the person), which just goes to show the totemic nature of both. 173</page><page sequence="12">Oedipus at Anyang Predictably, Mencius disagreed. He chided Wan Chang for reading the text so literally. Mencius contended that Hsiang was indeed sincere and came to Shun as a loving brother. Shun saw that and was pleased, so pleased that, wanting Hsiang to enjoy rank and wealth, Shun indeed gave Hsiang the domain of Yu Pi in the south. Wan Chang, however, was not about to back down that easily. He pointed out that he had never read anywhere about Hsiang being an ad- ministrator of Yu Pi. To that, Mencius answered that that appeared so only because Shun saw to it that Hsiang did not actually have to rule the district; somebody else had been deputized by Shun to run the office to spare Hsiang the work. One must admire the Mencian rhetoric; Men- cius gave him the last word, and no one since then seems to have doubted his word or given Wan Chang any credit. Wan Chang, however, had a point. The records, although inconclusive, could be read his way. If we assume for the moment that Wan Chang was right and that Shun did have this other face, does that mean that he was not always so filial? Is there not the possibility that he was an Oedipus in Anyang? Here are some preliminary suggestions. (1) The Blind Man did plot the death of Shun, but Shun, in filial deference to the Blind Man, retaliated only against Hsiang, his younger brother. (2) Perhaps, in an extended household, sibling rivalry (over property) overshadows any father-son rivalry (over a woman). The absence of primogeniture in China vis-a-vis her Japanese neighbor may (or may not) aggravate this infighting among heirs. (3) The major incest taboo is not mother and son (a recent Western phenomenon, according to Philippe Aries)26 but bro- ther and sister-in-law. These social anthropological speculations may be off base. Incest may never have been an issue in the Shun material; Hsiang may have claimed Shun's wives as just a piece of property. Indeed, the Shun and the Oedi- pus legends might originally have had nothing to do with the family. IV. BEYOND SUNRISE TO THE RISE OF THE TUNG I Allan has worked toward a Han Confucian ideology and institution of ruler and advisor-ancient heir and sage reborn-to keep naked power and moral legitimacy in their proper balance. I will leave that later de- velopment to Allan's capable hands in order to go behind her data and locate the earlier, the simpler, story. Yao's invitation to Shun to come west from the east marked the confluence of the two basic halves of early Chinese culture: Shun was the eastern barbarian invited to oversee the domain of the Hsia to the west. Shun's move as a Tung I into the west is modeled on a better-known and 26 See Philippe Aries, Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life, trans. Robert Baldick (New York: Knopf, 1962). Recent studies in the history of private life have thrown Freud's theory-predicated on warm, nuclear, introvert family life-out of sync. 174</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions better-recorded movement on the part of Archer I, the Archer of the eastern I people. Unlike the legend of Shun, which is fragmented and has no strong cultic base, the story of the Archer has near epic proportions, and temples dedicated to his memory flourished into historic times. The many stories of the Archer-China's Prometheus, Hercules, and Gilgamesh all rolled into one, and more-is too complex for us to retell and unravel here. We are only interested in one aspect: the Archer's rule over Hsia. The records, however, are divided. Some said that the Archer was appointed by heaven to assume the rule. This is somewhat anachronistic, since the idea of mandate of heaven would not have been current at the time of the Archer's legendary appointment (in the early Hsia dynasty). Being a eastern barbarian, the Archer could not have been well received by the Hsia people, and that may be why the record on him is divided. Some remember the Archer fondly as a hero who labored for the good of the people; others remember him as a tyrant. The difference is not likely due to whether the I or the Hsia were telling the story. Perhaps when he was leading his own people, the I, he was so good that he was appointed by heaven to assume rule over the Hsia (who had momentarily lost their mandate) and then turned into a tyrant and was removed (killed) by his own people. The Book of History depicts the Archer as the external threat that in- terrupted the Hsia reign of Great Prosperity and its recovery afterward, the reign of Lesser Prosperity. The expression Hsiao-k'ang chung-hsing, a lesser prosperity in the middynastic cycle, has since passed into Chi- nese proverbs to describe any middynastic restoration. Here is a precis of those events: The Hsia dynasty began with Ch'i, the son of Yii, but his son, T'ai K'ang, lost the virtue to rule, and Hsia fell to the eastern bar- barian Archer I. Hsiang, the son of Chung K'ang, brother of T'ai K'ang, struck up an alliance with the clan of Kun Wu to oppose the new rulers. In the meanwhile, Archer I had died at the hand of a trusted aid, Han Chu. Han Chu killed his lord and took possession of both his wife and his properties. In turn, he was killed by the aforesaid alliance. The Hsia dynasty regained its prosperity under the son of Chung K'ang, Hsiao K'ang. From that we have the expression in Chinese, "the middynastic prosperity of Hsiao K'ang."27 This tale of changing political fortunes is somewhat confusing. But if we look closely, we will find that its complexity is due to two lines of succession of rule, one I and one Hsia, that are pulled together and apart by the dialectics of the sage and the heir (see fig. 3). 27 This episode, which fits Allan's paradigm of the heir and the sage, is not included in her book Heir and the Sage. Once the structure of conflict consequent to Archer I's trip west is laid out, it is apparent that the story of Shun's trip west and his family conflict yields the same pattern in miniature. 175</page><page sequence="14">Oedipus at Anyang Hsia I Yu and Ch'i I (sage and heir) T'ai K'ang Chung K'ang (heir) (sage) Lost Fathered virtue Hsiang I l I I I Hsiang 4 (sage and heir) Ousted Han Chu Archer I Invited to rule Hsia Turned from hero to tyrant r-- I I (no Han Chu heir) Killed I and ruled (no sage) I Hsiao K'ang restoration Ended the rule by I FIG. 3.-A succession of Hsia rule as interrupted by I On the left (west) half of the figure, we see Yu and Ch'i still retained in one person both sagehood and heirship, but the son of Ch'i as heir failed in virtue.

Meanwhile, on the I side, Han Chu had killed the tyrant Archer and taken possession of the Archer's wife and properties, much as the Elephant (Hsiang), brother of Shun, had taken Shun's wife and properties. A ministerial appointee who killed his tyrannical lord, Han Chu could fill the role of a sage. He fell short, perhaps because that role had gone to Hsiang of the revitalized Hsia, who ousted Han Chu. If we put the lives of Shun and the Archer side by side, we may see how they describe the same career. (1) Both Shun and I are eastern bar- barians, (2) both were invited to rule in the west, (3) both were remem- bered for having a bow, (4) both supposedly married the same moon goddess, (5) both also married a nymph in a second marriage, and (6) the Archer shot down nine of the ten Sun-Birds, while Shun was attended by nine sons of Yao. In fact, Shun's family story is a compact version of the Archer's political career (see fig. 4). But Shun includes in his person what would be three persons in the Archer's narrative. Shun B is the sage who was a filial son to the Blind Man. Shun A was sought out by Yao as his heir. Yao had ten sons but somehow bypassed his own nine sons and picked Shun, an outsider, to be his successor. Shun B may be his tenth and adopted son, for it is as Shun C that Shun, combining the sage (Shun B) and heir (Shun A) aspects, would become the lasting ruler, unchallenged. In the figure, Hsiang stands in relation to Shun as Han Chu would to Archer I. The Archer trusted Han Chu; Shun trusted his brother. The Archer intended to make Han Chu his (adopted) heir: Shun gave a king- dom to Hsiang. Han Chu usurped the Archer's rule; Hsiang almost did the same. Their moves are not unprecedented among the sages them- selves: Shun is said to have imprisoned Yao as Yu is said to have im- prisoned Shun. Mencius saw only love between Shun and Hsiang: Wan 177</page><page sequence="16">Oedipus at Anyang Chang saw only animosity. But there may be a very real love-hate rela- tionship involved, that may have had a sociopolitical basis, namely, the survival of a matrilocal practice in a patriarchal society.28 There is a curious pattern in the Shang records of the throne's being passed laterally to a brother, the uncle of the king's son and heir, before it was formally passed to the crown prince. (This is said to be due to a pattern of maternal cross-cousin marriage.) The custom was so in- grained that even when Chou adopted a pure patriarchal succession, the duke of Chou, the brother of the Chou founder King Wen, still assumed regency before King Wu took rein. Stories of a brother's becoming a temporary regent (good) or of a sibling's becoming a deadly rival (bad) may be in part due to the survival of a norm of an earlier matrilocal so- ciety. At the time, when a person knew his mother but not his father, the maternal uncle was both a protector and a threat to his nephew. Although Yi Yin was no kin of the royal house, he played that double role. The Book of History remembers him as a sage who chastised and tutored the heir apparent. The Bamboo Annals remembers him as a potential threat whose death the exiled young king secretly plotted. The same matrilocal factor might explain both the ambivalence felt toward Archer I and the relationship between Yao and the Blind Man. The Archer was a hero turned tyrant, a Caligula syndrome rare in Chi- nese historiography. He is said to have no descendants, perhaps because in matrilineal societies, mothers rather than fathers had claim to the off- spring. If the Archer had married into the Hsia from the east to assume rule, then it is easy to see why the Hsia people disliked him and looked to the uncle of the displaced young (impotent, te-less) king for eventual deliverance. It is even possible that Han Chu on the I side was chosen as potential heir because he was the Archer's brother or brother-in-law. Things are made clearer by this hypothesis in the case of Yao and the Blind Man. The Blind Man was the father of Shun, but he is often per- ceived as the (evil) stepfather. The hidden genealogical truth may well 28 The view that the sibling rivalry between Shun and Hsiang and the conflict between sage (uncle regent) and heir (son) may be traced to a matrilocal social structure should be read with care. The existence of a matriarchal society in ancient China is a controverted issue for which we do not have good data. A number of articles in vol. 1 of the journal Chung-kuo shen-hua (ed. Yuan K'o [Peking, 1987]; I have not seen a second volume) deal with the subject. The People's Republic of China has Marxian-feminist scholars supporting the theory. Myths telling of matriarchy include stories of man-only or gentleman-only kingdoms in both east and west, Archer I's having no son, the impregnation of Hsia and Shang (not Chou) ancestresses by the divine Sun Bird, the lines of succession in early Shang, and the power of the relatives of the queen in Chinese court down through the Han. I speak of matrilocal customs surviving into the patriarchal to avoid the matriarchy hypothesis. In purely matrilocal practice, however, power over the woman's offspring would go to her brother, i.e., the uncle on the queen's side-not the uncle on the father's side, as with the duke of Chou being the younger brother of King Wu. 178</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions be that the Blind Man, too, married into the family and was therefore perceived as an outsider. Hsiang was Shun's younger brother, but he was perceived as an evil half-brother because of his family role. As the uncle trusted to guide Shun's son, he could have designs on being more than just mentor and regent. Finally, if both Yao and the Blind Man faced north as Shun faced south, they could be rival in-laws. It could be that the Hsia in the west was more patriarchal than the I in the east so that Yao in arranging for Shun to be married into his side of the fam- ily had the intention of passing his throne and fortune to him. The Blind Man and Hsiang might be opposing that more patrilineal custom. We have only the mythic structure; we do not have all the hard data to verify it. But if the legends of Archer I and of Shun indeed recall, in however badly mutilated a form, an early matrilocal custom's coming into conflict with an emerging patriarchy, then this whole tension be- tween sage and heir may not have arisen only with the differentiation of power and authority during the Chou enlightenment. If it were a conse- quence of a conflict between the uncle (originally on the mother's side) and nephew, then it may not have been the Chou revolt against the Shang that set the right of heaven's mandate against the might of a royal blood line but an earlier invasion of the eastern I into western Hsia. The issue was then not between sage and heir but between two types of heirs. V. GEOPOLITICS: A DEATH IN THE SUN But one final episode in the Shun material is amiss: his death on tour in the south. One can give a reasonable explanation for why Shun should die in a place called Desolate Pine in the south: the south is the home of the sun; the pine is a kin of the divine mulberry (the world tree); and the prefix "desolate" locates it at the ultimate end of the southern hori- zon.29 This is another geopolitical drama, this time involving the dalli- ance of Shun with a shamanic south and with its rivers and its nymphs. Shun had built an alliance with the south by marrying the goddess of the River Hsiang there; his lute is evidence of this, since music (and, therefore, musical instruments) played a large role in the shamanic cult of the south. Shun apparently controlled the south; he deputized his brother Hsiang (or someone else) to rule over the Yu Pi (Elephantine) domain. The alliance, it seems, did not work out perfectly, and Shun died on tour there. The same is said of the Archer, his fellow countryman, who also married a nymph of a river there, but his people's rule over the 29 On the possibility that Desolate Pine may have something to do with the solar mulberry in the south, see Whalen Lai, "The Shang Cosmos," review of The Shape of the Turtle by Sarah Allan, Taoist Resources 3, no. 1 (1991): 73-82. However, my preference for a single mulberry over the southeastern sea (in place of two mulberries, one east and one west) may be controverted. 179</page><page sequence="18">Oedipus at Anyang Hsia was ended when the Hsia allied themselves with the Wu Kun people of the south and together ousted the I control. In ancient China, south meant Ch'u, home of a shamanic land celebra- ted in Chii Yuan's Songs of the South, whose southern edge was Kwan- tung. In ancient China, elephants roamed from Annam to as far north as Kwantung. Very naturalistic depictions of elephants in bronzes have been unearthed in the Shang capital of Anyang. Shang culture, therefore, did reach as far south as this elephant area.30 Oracle bones, the earliest recorded writings of China, were also found at Anyang. And among those bones is one that Kuo Mo-jo had worked on and that Shirakawa Shizuka suspects to be a description of a performance of the imperial rite (called ti) performed by emperors for the Lord on High while facing south. The line reads, "Conducting the regal rite for the K'uei (dragon) in the south."31 I will not go into the mystery of the identity of this one- legged K'uei, which could be of a land, water, or air species. Shirakawa Shizuka favors the monkey, but on this occasion I would opt for the bird, since the Shang rulers considered themselves descendants of the Sun- Bird, and the script for the name Shun may show, in the oracle writing, the profile of a monkey or bird.32 I prefer to keep the animal totem of the monkey (or another land animal, such as the tiger) to the west and re- serve for the south the totem of the aquatic fish, tortoise, or snake (see fig. 5; nowadays, the placement of bird and fish is given in reverse). Sage-king Yii is traditionally said to be of Hsia (i.e., Hsia Yii), which would normally put him in the west. But Yii was himself a fish (yii); his father Kun was a tortoise; and their clan is known as Kun Wu, named after a giant fish, a Leviathan. (One record tells of these southern fishermen tat- 30 One such naturalistic Shang elephant bronze is in the Palace Museum in Taipei, but I have not been able to locate other evidence pointing to the existence of a southern elephant totem. The Yao and the Man had a dog totem (on the Dog Jung myths, see David Gordon White, Myths of the Dog-Man [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991], pp. 140-61.) The only connection I can make is that the word for elephant is "Hsiang" which is homophonic with "Hsiang," the river. It is also the word for the em- blems in the I Ching, a synonym of hsiang for form. The Dog myth in China has to do with formless chaos. Chaos emerges into outlines, shadows, and then into form. And Wang Pi in commenting on the principle at work in the Book of Changes has said, "When you grasp the meaning (behind the I Ching), you can forget the emblems." 31 For the oracle bone passages, see Shirakawa Shizuka, Chung-kuo shen-hua, trans. Wang Hsiao-lien (Taipei: Changran, 1983), pp. 127-28; for Shun as the one-legged monkey- like K'uei (in the southern reading), see p. 118; for Shun as the phoenix (in a eastern read- ing), see p. 120. I have picked the latter. 32 My full treatment on the identity of the one-legged K'uei is in a manuscript still being revised. But as I show in Lai, "Symbolism of Evil" (n. 7 above), the dragon is not a mythical animal; it is just the sum of all animals. Most studies on the Chinese dragon concentrate on its classic form, which crystallized in Han and often obscures more than it reveals. A book such as Lung Chin, Lung te Ch'i-su (Customs about the dragon; Taipei: 1989), is indeed just custom and folklore. These broken myths, when badly pieced together, tell us little about the real meaning and structure of this being. 180</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions West East Tiger Bird Fish South FIG. 5.-Possible totemic associations tooing themselves with fish scales before diving into the waters, immune to bites by the fish who were their totemic kin.) "Kun Wu" reversed is ho- mophonic with the Wu Kun clan with which Hsia aligned itself in opposing the Archer of the East-an alliance of water and land against air (birds). The Shang culture of the Sun Bird totem was apparently once headed by an eastern I (Archer, Shun) who ruled over the people of Hsia in the west. This Shang group once deputized an elephant man, Hsiang of the land animal totem, to rule over the south. But this moist land of totemic fishes and tortoises posed a further challenge to the Shang and the ten- sion that erupted is still preserved in the Shun and Archer I materials. This study has looked into the traditional legends about the sage-king's utter filial piety. The material is shown to be polysemic. Like Chinese magical boxes, the legend is about more than filial piety: it is also a poli- tical drama of sages and heirs, a record of cultural migrations and geo- political alliances and misalliances. It is about morality, might and right, power and authority. But there is one more box of boxes: it is about human beings and their place in the universe. VI. POSTSCRIPT ON THE LARGER PICTURE Let us return to the theme of Oedipus in Anyang. In the end, Shun is no Oedipus, and Chinese culture is no Greek culture. The difference is not because China is filial and the west is Oedipal-characterized by a na- tional myth of great significance, but a myth nonetheless. What is miss- ing in China is the material that lies behind the Laius-Oedipus conflict. 181</page><page sequence="20">Oedipus at Anyang Father-son conflict in Greece is isomorphic with the conflict of Olympi- ans and Titans, which in turn is isomorphic with the Indo-Aryan conquest of the native population and their gods, all told in an epic of war that celebrates conflict. The stable of Homeric heroes is finally set in the larger picture of a vertical, three-tiered universe that Dumezil has decoded for us. Little of that is found behind the myth of Shun and the Blind Man. China has its share of familial, social, cultural, and geographical conflict. In the texts under consideration here, there is the rise of the Sun Bird (sky deity) and the demotion of the snakes and tortoises (to the subter- ranean waters) and the parallel march of the eastern I into the western Hsia. But all indications are that there was not the kind of subjugation of a native population by a foreign one as there was in the west. Local cultures (to borrow from Eberhard) in China blended with one another, perhaps even were superimposed on one another, with farmers and herds- men living side by side in the same landscape with different land atti- tudes. Chinese culture is a synthesis of I and Hsia, and then Ch'u, and so forth in the expanding incorporation of such local people into one. War, conflict, and bloodshed existed in the founding days of the dy- nasties, but the architects of peace and culture in China were not the warriors or their bards, the heroes or their adorers. In China, it is the upright weaklings, the literati of wen, who created the art of peace and compromise. The Greeks could not do without their myth about the vir- tue required by conflict; the Chinese could not do without their myth of the good required for harmony. Both are myths and not the whole truth, but they colored truth to give us different ways of looking at the same world. The myth of harmony rewrote the Chinese tales of conflicts and gave them a distinctive flavor and ending not typical of the West. Conflicts were not lacking. Yao imprisoned Shun. Shun imprisoned Yii. The Blind Man plotted the death of Shun. Shun exiled his brother Hsiang to the south. Kun in the time of Yao, according to the Han-fei-tzu, opposed the appointment of Shun. Kun was subsequently executed as a great criminal for that offense, and so on. Such tales are not found just in the unofficial records. The conflicts might pit the good sage against the bad heir or the good heir against a scheming regent, but China lacks any backdrop of irreconcilable differences. Behind Yao, Shun, and Yii, in that larger picture, is a cycle of seasons. The Blind Man and Shun turned out to be night and day, not the Persian type, but yin and yang. Hsiang, the elephant brother of Shun, turned out to be redeemable after all. The Blind Man, in the end, was no less amendable, or so the Mencian account insists. The root metaphor of China may therefore be the circle, whereas that of the West may be the tiered pyramid. Humans in the West are hampered and hounded from all 182</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions three sides, from above, from below, and from the environment. Humans in China are supposed to unite heaven and earth into a whole. The anthropogenic myth of the West, that of Oedipus, turns out to be a tale of such limitations. Oedipus, the "swollen-legged" or the one- legged, was originally mothered by the four-legged sphinx, the Great Mother to whose womb Oedipus should hobble on three legs and crawl joyfully back on four.33 Oedipus rejected the Earth Mother, declared himself man, and killed her (turned her into stone) in the process. That key breakthrough, however, cost him his immortality. Now Oedipus, mankind itself, is mortal, slave to the new gods, the Olympians, to be punished for a crime he did not know he committed. The Sky Gods handed down a final verdict: It does not matter if you did not know. You are guilty by virtue of the fact that you desired to know. That desire for knowledge is hubris enough, for man should not overstep the bounds of his mortal limits set by the gods. Transgression invites retaliation. None of this is in the Shun material. This potential Oedipus at Anyang was himself the K'uei dragon, the One-Legged Earth-Born, a Sphinx. He had no need to slay dragons, as he was himself the Dragon. He was the Bird-Man as his brother Hsiang was the Elephant-Man and his succes- sor, the sage-king Yii was the Fish-Man. Like Oedipus, Shun rose from four-legged (animal) earth in the morning; climbed to the apex of the sky, perched on the roof of the barn, flew down in the afternoon as the sun sets toward the west, and made his way back east swimming like a fish in the underworld. Shun was no mortal; he was immortal. Even after he died, he came back every morning anew. His life is recycled in other lives as Yao, as Yii, and the Blind Man, as Archer I, as Hsiang, in an end- less masquerade. All Chinese are potential Shun, filial sons whose piety can move heaven. But Chinese culture was not stagnant. Shun tested his share of limits: he rose from peasant to king; he waged wars; he even took on Yao, judged the Blind Man, and rivaled his brother's shrewd ways. As ruler, he executed his share of evil men, but in the end, he pacified by his virtue. That is to say, he also pleased Yao, served the Blind Man well, and duly rewarded Hsiang. From the story of Shun came not the Greek heroic tragedy but the Chinese filial opera. It is a story in the round, tire- lessly repetitive and with no clear boundaries on time or place, more a tearjerker tugging at the heart than a calculated, rational catharsis meant 33 This is my reading of the original intention of the riddle of the Sphinx; see Lai, "Symbolism of Evil" (n. 7 above). The larger picture I hope to reconstruct is that of the world of the Shang as a world of hybrid man-beasts in the myths and of animal masks in the rites. See Whalen Lai, "Looking for Mr. Ho Po: Unmasking the River God of Ancient China," History of Religions 29, no. 4 (1990): 335-50, and "From Protean Ape to Beautiful Saint: The Monkey King," Asian Folklore Studies 53 (1994): 29-65. 183</page><page sequence="22">Oedipus at Anyang for a soul torn between daring and guilt. Where tragedy celebrates fear and pity, the Chinese prefer a mix of rejoicing and anger, sadness and happiness. For Chinese filial operas, there is always a happy ending, however delayed and however baroque (double and triple happiness) it must appear. And despite all the unofficial records, there is in the end only Shun the pious son. There is no Oedipus at Anyang.34 University of California, Davis 34 This article, which seeks to unmask Shun, is in part meant as a critique of the re- versed euhemerism thesis begun by Dirk Bodde and continued by others, e.g., William G. Boltz ("Kung Kung: Reversed Euhemerism in the Yao Tien," T'oung Pao 67 [1981]: 141- 53). Euhemerism, reversed or straight, is based on a yet-unproven anthropomorphic premise: that man and god look alike. Before man looked like god or vice versa, they looked like animals. China has her myths and her age of gods preserved fairly intact in the oracle bones and the ritual bronzes. The Shang gods are all there in the Shang bronzes, Beast and Beauty, and are readily apparent to us if only the viewers can be less anthro- pocentric and allow their horizons of self and world to be disrupted and then put back to- gether (Gadamer-style) by these metaphors of the divine in their endless zoomorphic metamorphosis. 184</page></plain_text>
