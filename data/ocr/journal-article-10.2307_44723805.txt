Patrick Wayne State University SEVERAL INVESTIGATORS (1,2)* HAVE REPORTED higher force levels for dummy subjects than for cadaver subjects when impacted in the knee with unpadded or lightly padded impactors. King et al. (3) have also suggested knee impact response differences between dummy and human subjects. Their results raise the following questions about the use of dummies for assessinq the protection provided by the lower instrument panels of automobile interiors: i. Are the forces sensed by the axial femoral force transducers comparable to the forces experienced by its human counterpart? ii. Should a one-to-one comparison be made between the dummy's femoral force transducer loads and the tolerance level of 1700 lb speci- fied in MVSS 208, which was based on knee loads and not femoral shaft loads? The intent of the investigation presented in this report was to determine if the heavy * Numbers in () refer to references rigid metal skeleton of the Part 572 dummy (4), which comprises a majority of its body weight, could cause differences in knee impact response compared to the human whose weight is primarily contained in less rigid materials, such as flesh and fluids. Nóndeformable impac- tors were used to provide a fast rise time of the knee impact force. It was thought that mass differences would be most sensitive to high rates of knee loading. This paper discusses 1) the impact force response found for unembalmed male cadaver subjects when the knee is struck with nondeform- able pendulum impactors; 2) the reasons why a different impact force response was found for the Part 572 dummy when impacted in a similar fashion; and 3) the difference found between the dummy femur transducer force and the dummy knee impact force for these impacts. The knee impact tests were made to determine impact force response, not fracture response. Consequently, forces for cadaver subjects were limited to 6000 N. The force level is ABSTRACT Knee impacts along the femoral axis of unembalmed male cadavers and Part 572 dummies were made with rigid pendulum impactors at Wayne State University. The dummy exhibited significantly higher knee impact forces than the cadaver subjects. This difference of response is shown to be due to differences of effective leq mass and knee padding. The dummy with its heavy rigid metal skeleton is not like its human counterpart, where the majority of the leg weight is composed of loosely coupled flesh. The knee impacts of the dummy subjects showed that the dummy femur transducer force was consistently less than the corresponding dummy knee impact force by a constant ratio of 0.8. We recommend that the "skeletal" weight of the Part 572 dummy leg should be substantial- ly reduced, with the weight difference being added to a properly simulated leg flesh. Also, the simulated flesh covering of the knee should be modified to reduce the peak force resulting from rigid body impacts. 2524</page><page sequence="2">generally less than reported (1,2,5,6,7) knee impact forces, which have resulted in skeletal fractures. No fractures were produced during our test program. TEST METHOD IMPACTORS - A series of flat faced, nonde- formable pendulum impactors were used to deter- mine the knee response to impact with rigid objects. The initial cadaver and dummy tests used a range of pendulum weights from 0.24 to 25 kg. This range of pendulum weight was modified to 0.5 to 12 kg for later dummy and cadaver testing. The pendulum weights and impact face diameters are given in Table 1. All but the 25 kg pendulum were suspended on three strands of 4.8 mm bead chain with a swing radius of approximately 2 m. Two strands of chain were at the front of the pendulum and one at the rear. These pendulums were hand-held and released, the desired drop height measured with a height gaqe. The 25 kg pendulum was suspended on four wire cables and released by a solenoid actuated device. Droo heights up to 0.8 m were used. ALIGNMENT OF THE KNEE AND IMPACTOR - The subject was placed in front of the pendulum such that the pendulum just contacted the knee when hanging free. The upper leg of the subject was subjectively positioned such that the direction of impact was nominally along the femoral axis. The lower leg was positioned such that the angle between the upper and lower leg was 1.1 to 1.2 rad. This lower leg position was chosen so that the cadaver's patella would be directly in front of the femur. The direction of the pendulum travel was subjectively aligned with the fore- most projection of the patella. Final align- ment adjustments were made to assure a "souare" rebound of the pendulum from the knee. TEST CONFIGURATIONS - Three impact configur- ations were used: 1) whole body; 2) leg only; and 3) leg rigidly mounted. In the whole body tests, the subject was seated in a chair as shown in Fig. 1. The pelvis was spaced away from the chair back so that the pelvis would not load against the back support when impacted. For the second configuration, the leg was removed from the subject at the hip joint, leaving the femur and surrounding material intact. The leg was placed on the chair such that the leg would not load against the chair back when impacted (Fig. 2). For the third configuration, the leg was mounted to a rigid structure, greatly increasing the effective mass of the femur. In the case of the dummy's leg, the femur was disassembled at the rear of the femoral load cell and then mounted to a rigid structure (Fig. 3). For the cadaver, the thigh was severed at an equivalent distance behind the knee.

The sleeve was then attached to the rigid structure. SUBJECTS - Two Part 572 dummies were tested. One dummy, referred to as Part 572 dummy (A), was manufactured by Alderson Research Laboratories. The other dummy, referred to as Part 572 dummy (S), was manufactured by Sierra Engineering. Six unembalmed male cadavers were tested. These tests were conducted at Wayne State Univer- sity. The cadavers were stored at 1 to 4°C and taken from the cooler for no more than three hours at a time. Table 2 lists basic data for the cadaver subjects. INSTRUMENTATION - An accelerometer (+ 5% to 2000 Hz) was mounted on the rear of each pendulum such that the accelerometer' s axis passed through the pendulum's center of gravity in the direction of impact. For the Part 572 dummy (S) and cadaver 3150 and 3281 subjects, an accelerometer (+ 5% to 5000 Hz) was attached to the femur about 2/3 of the femur length from the distal end. The accelerometer' s sensitive axis was nominally aligned with the femoral axis. Since the cadaver femur is curved and offset, the placement of the accelerometer axis was subjective. No attempt was made to define a femoral axis. Since the acceleration errors involved would be modified by the cosine of the angular misa- lignment, not greater than 0.1 rad, it was felt that these errors would be of negligible importance for this test series. The cadaver femur accelerometer was mounted on an aluminum bone plate which was screwed to the femur. The dummy's femur accelerometer was bolted directly to the femur near the back side of the lead ballast. An accelerometer (+ 5% to 5000 Hz) was also placed on the tibia of the Part 572 dummy (S) and cadaver 3281 subjects, such that the 2525</page><page sequence="3">2526 J. D. HORSCH AND L. M.

For the cadaver the accelerometer was mounted on the end of a screw which was extended com- pletely through the tibia. The accelerometer was attached at a point located about 40% of the length of the tibia from the proximal end. The alignments of the tibia accelerometers for cadaver 3281 were about 0.15 rad out of the femur-tibia plane primarily due to the shape of the tibia. Transducer signals were recorded by a light beam oscillograph (+5% to 1000 Hz) and wideband (+_ 5% at 20 kHz) on an FM analog tape recorder. The analog tape data was digitized at 10,000 points per second, the analog playback being filtered to be nearly compatible with SAE Channel Class 1000 frequency response definition, which is equivalent to the frequepcy response of the galvanometers. COMPARISON OF MEASURED RESPONSES The impact force acting between the pendulum and knee was determined by multiplying the pendulum acceleration by the pendulum mass. This external knee impact force, as a function of time, was determined for ąll impacts. Figure 4 shows a comparative time history of the knee impact force for VISU cadaver 3150 and Part 572 dummy (A), this test condition of a 0.225 m drop (2.1 m/s impact velocity) and a 25 kg pendulum mass is nearly the same condition prescribed by the Part 572.10 knee impact test (4) (23.4 kg pendulum weight and 2.1 m/s impact velocity). Typical comparative time histories between the WSU cadaver 3281 and the Part 572 dummy (S) are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. These are whole body test results for a 0.225 m drop with a 5 kg pendulum mass. Pendulum acceleration and force and femur acceleration are plotted versus time.

The peak knee impact force for whole body impacts of the left knee of WSU cadaver 3281 are tabulated in Appendix A.l and plotted on a log-log scale as a function of drop height 1n Fig. 7, and as a function of pendulum mass in Fig. 8. From this data, the peak force levels for a 0.225 m drop height for the various pendulum masses were chosen as measures of the subject's knee impact peak force responses. The knee impact peak forces at a 0.225 m drop height for various pendulum masses are tabulated in Appendix B for all subjects. Also listed in Appendix B are the mean values and standard deviations for both dummies and for six cadaver subjects for each pendulum mass. The mean values and the standard deviations were computed by considering the data obtained from the right and left legs of each subject as independent response measurements. The data from Appendix B are plotted in Fig. 9 on log-log scales as the mean peak force produced by a 0.225 m drop height for both the dummy and cadaver subjects versus pendulum mass.

The mean peak external knee forces produced by impacts with nondeformable objects are significantly higher for the Part 572 dummy subjects than for the cadaver subjects as shown in Fig. 9. The difference is greater with heavier impactors. PEAK FEMUR ACCELERATION RESPONSE - Accel erometers were mounted on the femurs of the Part 572 dummy (S) and two cadaver subjects (WSU 3150 and 3281) such that the sensitive axis was nominally parallel to the femoral axis. Typical time histories of the femoral accelerations for comparable whole body dummy and cadaver knee impacts are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The peak femur acceleration is plotted in Fig. 10 against the peak knee impact force for the Part 572 dummy (S) and two cadaver subjects over the range of pendulum masses and drop heights used. These data are tabulated in Appendices A.l , A. 2, and A. 3. Knee impacts were made for the leg only test mode of the Part 572 dummy (S) and WSU cadaver 3150 with the femur accel erome- ters in place. The peak femur acceleration and the peak knee impact force for these tests are listed in Appendix A. 3. These data are also plotted in Fig. 10, along with the whole body impact test peak values. There is a significant difference of the peak femur acceleration between the dummy and cadaver subjects for the same peak knee impact force, the cadaver's femur having approximately six times greater peak acceleration. There also appears to be a greater peak femur acceleration for the same peak knee impact force between the whole body and leg free test modes, approximat- ely 1.3 times higher for the Part 572 dummy and 1.8 times higher for the cadaver subject. LEG RIGIDLY MOUNTED IMPACT FORCE RESPONSE - Both legs of WSU cadavers 3281 and 3373 and the right leg of WSU cadaver 3150 were severed at a point corresponding to the location of the proximal end of the dummy femur force transducer. The ends of the severed femurs were molded into metal cylinders which could be attached to a rigid structure for testing. This was done to provide a very large subject mass for the cadaver knee. The legs of both Part 572 dummies were separated at the proximal ends of their femur force transdu- cers so that they also could be attached to the rigid structure and, thus, have a very large knee mass similar to the rigidly mounted cadaver knees. Knee impact tests were conducted using the same pendulum masses and impact velocity used for the whole body tests described previously. The purpose of these tests was to identify what effect knee "padding" (compliance of the skin, patella, and femur) had on the measured responses. Figure 11 shows a typical knee impact force time history comparison for the Part 572 dummy (S) and cadaver 3281. The peak knee impact forces for the various pendulum masses at the 0.225 m drop height are tabulated in Appendix C for the subjects tested in the leg rigidly mounted test mode. Mean peak force levels for both dummies and for the cadaver subjects at each pendulum mass are plotted logarithmically in Fig. 12. Also shown are curves approximating + 1 standard deviation from the mean curves.

EFFECTIVE SUBJECT MASS TWO-MASS MODEL - Several methods were used to estimate the effective subject mass which inertially resisted the impact pendulum and to determine the influence of this effective subject mass on the peak impact force level. A simple two-mass model was used as a guide to estimate these factors. The two-mass model, shown in Fig. 13, consists of two rigid bodies-the pendulum impactor, mp, and that part of the subject which is inertially loaded by the impactor, m$. The mass of the padding interface between the two masses is assumed negligible. For the dummy the subject mass is separated into two parts by the femur load cell, the effective mass of the knee, pi|&lt;, and the effective body mass proximal to the transducer, mg. These two parts are assumed rigidly coupled and, thus, act inertially as one mass in resisting the impact. Thus, ms = mK + mß, and a$ = aß = aK, and Vs - VB - VK. For this simple model several statements of its response to impact can be made based on force, momentum, and energy considerations of the masses. Force: Fp»FK (1) Ep = Np3p (2) F., = nua«.

These re- sponses were pendulum and femur acceleration and, for the dummy, femur transducer force. The re- sponses of these subjects are analyzed by using the equations derived for the response of the two-mass model . ESTIMATION OF SUBJECT MASS - Estimations of the effective subject mass inertially resisting the pendulum impactor were made by assuming that the subjects behaved as the two-mass model. Two methods of computing an effective subject mass were used. Using the measured pendulum and femur accelerations and the pendulum mass, the effec- tive subject mass was calculated by equation (6). The second method utilized the momentum analysis. The pendulum and subject vélocités were obtained by integration of the respective measured accel- erations, and the effective subject mass was com- puted using equation (9). These computations, as a function of time, were applied to a similar im- pact (a 5 kg pendulum with a 0.225 m drop height) for both the Part 572 dummy (S) and cadaver 3281 subjects. These are the same response data which are plotted in Figs. 5 and 6. The computed effective subject masses based on these two methods of analysis are plotted versus time in Fig. 14. Also shown on a separate graph in Fig. 14 is the knee force as a function of time for each subject. During the initial part of the impact, both methods predict the same effective mass for a given subject. However, the effective subject mass of the dummy (about 11 kg) is significantly greater than that of the cadaver subject (nearly 2 kg). At or slightly before peak force, the mass calculated by the acceleration method starts to rise rapidly. This is due to the femur accel- eration starting to drop rapidly and becoming as l' 25 F Dummy (S) « I - Momentum Method as Dummy (S) « ... ,. 1A. S 20- 'A ! ms"mp(Vo"Vp,/Vs ... ,. 1A.

As expected, the momentum method, which is based on the integration of the pendulum and femur acceleration, indicates a gradual in- crease of subject mass with time. It is con- cluded that the computed mass is a good estimate of the effective subject mass for times up to peak force for the dummy and to nearly peak force for the cadaver subject. Neither subject behaves as the two-mass model after the peak force ; additional mass or resisting forces are applied to the femur mass as it is displaced rearward. To obtain estimates of the effective subject mass resisting the impacts to the knee for a range of impactor masses and striking velocities the peak femur acceleration was plotted as a function of the corresponding peak knee impact force for WSU cadavers 3150 and 3281 and the Part 572 dummy (S) (Fig. 10). According to equation (6), the slope of any straight line passing through the origin of this graph will be inversely proportional to the effective subject mass resisting the knee impact. Straight lines were fitted to the dummy and cadaver data. This demonstrates that there are large differ- ences in the effective subject mass resisting the knee impact- 11.5 kg for the Part 572 dummy (S) and 1.5 kg for the cadaver subjects. There is a slight phase difference between the peak pendulum force and femur acceleration (see Figs. 5 and 6). This will cause a small error in the estimate of the effective subject mass. However, these estimates agree well with</page><page sequence="9">2532 J. D. HORSCH AND L. M. PATRICK the previous discussion of Fig. 14, computed as a function of time for a single test. The leg free test mode data are also plotted in Fig. 10. These data show lower effective subject masses than the whole body test mode. The leg free test mode gives estimated effective subject masses of 0.9 kg for WSU cadaver 3150 and 9.0 kg for the Part 572 dummy (S). The 0.9 kg effective subject mass determined for the cadaver leg free test mode is approximately the mass of the femur itself. This indicates that the tibia and flesh covering the femur do not add significant resistance to the impactor at the time of peak force for the cadaver subjects. This could be seen from high-speed movies. The femur "jumped" rearward at impact, but the flesh did not start to move until later, well after the peak force. The additional estimated sub- ject mass for the whole body versus the leg free test mode is assumed to be due to the inter- action of the femoral head with the pelvis of the subject. EFFECT OF SUBJECT MASS ON PEAK IMPACT FORCE- Assuming that at or near peak force the velocity of the femur equals the velocity of the pendu- lum, then the energy stored in the interface Eļ should be a function of the peak force Fp. Consequently, the logarithm of the peak knee impact force was plotted versus the logarithm of the expression: hmpms/(mp + m$) , which is proportional to Eļ as indicated by equation (14). This graph of the data from WSU cadaver 3281 is plotted in Fig. 15. The subject mass m$ was assumed to be 2.0 kg--the estimated subject mass at the time of peak force - for the whole body tests and infinite for the knee rigidly mounted tests. The fit of the plotted points to a single line is quite good. The logarithm of peak knee impact force for the Part 572 dummy (S) was also plotted versus the logarithm of: hmpms/(mp + m$) , in Fig. 16. A subject mass of 11.5 kg- the estimated subject mass- -was used for the whole body impacts, 9.0 kg for the leg only impacts, and infinite for the leg rigidly mounted im- pacts. Again, a reasonable fit to a single line through the data was achieved. The expression: hmpms/(mp + m$) , provides a means of explaining the effects which subject and pendulum masses have on the peak knee impact force, Fp. Empirically, Fp = f[hmpms/(mp + m$)] . (15) This function contains the drop height (h). It also contains a mass term referred to as the equivalent system mass. For the case where the pendulum mass, mp, is much larger than the effective subject mass, ms, the peak knee force becomes: ir mS 1 ^Vmp»ms ~ limmp»ms f " mp+ms J (16] = f Lhms] . It can be shown in similar fashion that: " f[hmpl • &lt;") Equation (16) implies that for a given subject mass and pendulum impact velocity, the peak knee force will approach an asymptote as the pendulum mass is increased. Also, for a given pendulum mass and impact velocity for subjects having similar responses of the knee padding interface, the subject with the greater mass resisting the impact will experience the higher peak knee force. The difference between subjects will be greatest for large pendulum masses. These points are clearly demonstrated in Fig. 9. It should be noted that the response of the knee padding interface has not been described by our simple two-mass model. It would be possible to reduce the peak knee force of the dummy to that of the cadaver subjects for a given impact by modifying the knee padding response. However, it is unlikely that the response of the dummy could be made compatible with the cadaver subjects over the range of impactor masses and velocities which were used _ 10000 1- . ■§ WSU Cadaver 3281 ^ ^ Left Knee I 3 000 - m/; I -Jť «5 • Rigid Mount 2L IT)#» ® oo f 2L 1000 - V* IT)#» S $ / A Whole Body 5. yC m$ - 2.0 kg I 300 1 1 1 1 1 .03 0.1 0.3 1.0 3.0 Drop Height ° Equivalent System Mass (kg-m) (Log Scale) ("Ä) Fig. 15 - Peak knee impact force of WSU cadaver 3281 versus drop height multiplied by equivalent system mass - 0.5 to 5.0 kg pendulum mass - 0.1 to 0.8 m drop height</page><page sequence="10">CADAVER AND DUMMY KNEE IMPACT RESPONSE 2533 30000 - Part 372 Dummy (S) _ Left Knee - ^ 3 X ^ 10 000 - JC S M' 2 ° 3000 - n. ââ , tj jfè • n.

ESTIMATE OF PEAK FORCE RESPONSE TO THE PART 572.10 KNEE IMPACT (4)--The expression for peak knee impact force given in equation (15) allows estimation of peak force for test conditions not run. For a given subject, all impacts having the same value of the function expressed in equation (15) will have the same peak force, even though test conditions were different. Computation of this function, hmpms/(mp + m$) , for a specified test condition will allow reading of an estimated value of the peak force from Figs. 15 or 16 for either cadaver 3281 or Part 572 dummy (S), respectively. This technique was applied to the Part 572.10 knee impact test condition of a 23.4 kg pendulum mass and a 2.1 m/s impact velocity (0.225 m drop height). The estimated peak knee impact force response of WSU cadaver 3281 to the Part 572.10 knee impact condition is 2750 N. This value was found from Fig. 15 using a coordinate value of 0.414 kg-m [0.225 X 23.4 x 2.0/(23.4 + 2.0)] for the abscissa. This estimated peak force of 2750 N for cadaver 3281 compares well with the measured peak force of 3091 N for cadaver 3150, which was measured using a slightly greater pendulum mass (25 kg instead of 23.4 kg) dropped from the same height of 0.225 m. The estimated and measured cadaver peak knee impact forces of 2750 N and 3091 N, respectively, are significant- ly less than the Part 572.10 knee impact test specification of 8451 M to 11120 N peak force. If the knee flesh padding response of the Part 572 dummy was modified to give the same peak force response as the patella/flesh response of cadaver 3281 (they would then have the same rigid mounted response), this modified Part 572 dummy would give an estimated peak knee impact force of 6800 N. This value was found from Fig. 15 using a coordinate value of 1.73 kg-m [0.225 x 23.4 x 11.5/(23.4 + 11.5)] for the abscissa. Use of the equivalent system mass allows the knee flesh padding response to be determined from a whole body test provided the effective subject mass is known. DUMMY FEMUR TRANSDUCER FORCE The force measured by the dummy femur force transducer is not necessarily the same as the dummy knee impacting force. Figure 6 shows a typical time history of the Part 572 dummy (S) femur transducer force and dummy knee impact force for an impact with a 5 kg pendulum at a 0.225 m drop height. The femur transducer force is less than the knee impact force at all times during the high force portions of the impact. Several relationships were derived using the two-mass model to show response of the dummy femur transducer force as a function of knee impact force. Equation (7) states that the ratio of the dummy femur transducer force to the impact force should be a constant for a particular subject, independent of pendu- lum weight or impact velocity, and remain con- stant throughout the impact. Equation (7) also states that this ratio of forces is determined by the ratio of that portion of the subject mass proximal to the femur force transducer iner- tially resisting the impact, mg, to the total subject mass inertially resisting the impact, ms. The peak dummy femur transducer force is compared to the peak knee impact force for the Part 572 dummy (S) in Fig. 17 over the range of pendulum weights and drop heights. All three test modes are presented: whole body, leg free, and rigid mounted. Each test mode has a good fit to a straight line--a straight line being the response of the two-mass model for a partic- ular subject mass ratio. Note that the peak knee impact force is greater than the peak femur transducer force for the leg free and whole body configurations. Of particular significance is the fact that for the whole body tests the peak femur transducer force is 0.8 of the peak pendu- lum knee force. For the rigid mounted case the forces are equal. Additional tests were conducted to determine the dummy's response for impacts with various amounts of mass attached to the dummy femur, proximal to the force transducer. Figure 18 is a plot of the ratio of peak femur transducer force to peak knee impact force versus the ratio of the effective subject mass proximal to the femur transducer to the effective subject mass. The fit of a straight line through the points in Fig. 18 shows that the dummy femur transducer</page><page sequence="11">2534 J. D. HORSCH AND L. M.

Although it might appear that a constant ratio between external knee force and femur transducer force might exist for the Part 572 dummy (S), this is probably not the case. If the external knee force is not in line with the femur axis, and/or the lower leg is loaded, or if the pelvis is restrained by a belt, the ratio of 0.8 will not necessarily be observed. Each of these examples will change the test conditions used for the impacts and the assumptions made for the analysis. FEMUR-TIBIA COUPLING The knee joint of the cadaver does not re- spond as a pin joint. Impacts were made on the patella in line with the end of the femur (the standard pendulum impact configuration) and on the proximal end of the tibia parallel to the axis of the femur, such that the impactor only contacted either the patella or tibia but not both. Figures 19 and 20 are time histories of the pendulum, femur and tibia accelerations, and of the femur and tibia displacements derived from double integration of the respective accel- erations. For the impact on the patella (Fig. 19), the femur is displaced during the loading pulse, but the tibia starts its displacement near the end of the loading pulse. For the impact on the tibia (Fig. 20), the tibia shows considerable displacement before the femur moves significantly (about 3 mm relative movement by this impact). One significance of this relative motion between the femur and tibia is that the mass of the tibia is not tightly coupled to that of the femur for short duration force pulses. Conse- quently, the mass of the tibia does not add significantly to the effective subject mass resisting the impactor during the majority of the loading. A second implication is that the tibia can sustain very high peak forces without transmit- ting forces directly to the femur. Thus, a short duration impact, which loaded both the femur and tibia would show a greater peak knee force than that actually being transmitted to the femur. Under certain alignment conditions with lightly padded or unpadded impactors im- pacting the knee, the femur force could be sig- nificantly less than the measured impact force. CONCLUSIONS The impact force response of the Part 572 dummy to knee impacts with nondeformable objects is different than the response of unembalmed male cadaver subjects-the dummy exhibiting significantly higher forces. This response difference is due primarily to the much greater dummy effective mass inertia! ly loaded by the impact and, in part, to an improper response of 1.0 1- J Fp - Femur Transducer u.^ / Force / F„ - Knee Impact Force 2 /* 13 / mR -Effective Subject / Mass Proximal to g / Femur Transducer 2 / m -Total Effective i I Subject Mass 0 0.5 1.0 Mass Ratio - Fig. 18 - Comparison of dummy peak force ratio to dummy effective mass ratio for Part 572 dummy (S)</page><page sequence="12">CADAVER AND DUMMY KNEE IMPACT RESPONSE 2535 200 r- Pendulum 150 - Acceleration (Polarity Reversed) f'y -,4.0 § ^»100 I ' TO g I ' Femur Acceleration °ļ 1 I '/ Tibia " 3 0 IX Displacement &lt; 50 - I /I Femur " 20 E # /1 Displacement ^ J ' : ' ' 10 § M ft ' : V - § " M --r-i. /"'-Hy.. - n I I ' .... - •' Tibia Acceleration -50 1 1 1 1 0 2 4 6 8 Time (ms) Fig. 19 - Patella impact response - WSU cadaver 3281 left knee - whole body test mode - 0.5 kg pendulum mass - 0.225 m drop height i ^-Pendulum Acceleration 2QQ _ (Polarity Reversed) ř 150 - I1 I i ^ Tibia Acceleration c V ^ ■Ķ ļ00 _ J Tibia Displacement^ -|4.0 I - - ^ Oí I ^ CD - Oí I I ^ ■ 30 T CD I s Femur J S Displacement "I J '/ S A Displacement L ' % J a V Q Femur y *' ' ' ' '** Acceleration -A y / * / N- ' v/ V -50 I 1 1 1 0 2 4 6 8 Time (ms) Fig. 20 - Tibia impact response - WSU cadaver 3281 left knee - whole body test mode - 0.5 kg pendulum mass - 0.225 m drop height the dummy's knee padding, as compared to the cadaver's skin, patella, and less rigid femur. The effective mass difference is due pri- marily to differences of the rigidity of the materials which comprise the dummy and cadaver subjects, not a difference of total subject mass. The flesh of the cadaver subjects does not respond the same as the heavy rigid metal femur of the Part 572 dummy whose excessive mass replaces the soft flesh of the cadaver subjects. The cadaver upper leg flesh does not appear to be highly coupled to the femur for high rates of loading. The use of a one-to-one comparison of Part 572 dummy femur transducer peak force with ca- daver knee impact forces (for which skeletal fractures have been found) to specify a femur axial loading tolerance does not appear justi- fied, if the structure struck by the knee is rigid or contains significant mass. Not only were the knee impact peak forces of the Part 572 dummy from 1.5 to 3.7 times greater than the mean of the cadaver subjects tested, but also the dummy femur transducer peak force was less than the dummy knee impact peak force by a constant ratio of 0.8. This femur transducer force/knee impact force ratio was shown to be equal to the ratio of the effective subject mass proximal to the femur transducer to the total effective subject mass. It appears unlikely that a correction factor could be applied to the measured dummy femur transducer force, since-among other reasons-it was shown that the difference between dummy and cadaver peak knee impact forces increased with increasing impactor mass. RECOMMENDATIONS The knee impact force response for cadaver subjects for a large range of rigid impactor masses should be used as a necessary, but not sufficient, biomechanical dummy knee response evaluation guide. An estimate of this response is provided by the mean peak knee impact force response of the six WSU cadaver subjects shown in Fig. 9 for a range of pendulum mass of 0.5 to 12 kg at a 0.225 m drop height. To achieve the proper response to nondeform- able impactors, the skeletal weight of the Part 572 dummy must be substantially reduced; not only the femur, but also the knee, tibia, and pelvic structure. The weight removed should then be added to a properly simulated flesh. Although the impacts with nondeformable pen- dulums demonstrated an impact condition for which the cadaver flesh is not highly coupled to the skeleton, it does not define how the flesh should be coupled to the skeleton. The Part 572 dummy knee flesh also requires modification to achieve a biomechani- cally improved response to knee impacts with rigid objects in order to lower the impact forces. This would appear to be the easier part of the necessary modifications of the Part 572 dummy to improve its knee response. The knee flesh impact response measurements should be made with the knee mounted against a rigid structure, as described</page><page sequence="13">2536 J. D. HORSCH AND L. M.
