After  considering past research into political strategies in  western Mexico, I discuss recent analyses that associ- ate different types of formal built space in the Tequila  valleys with conflicting political strategies by virtue of  their spatial characteristics as well as iconographic and  archaeological evidence. Despite their strategic asso- ciations, the architectural forms share close proximity,  even physical integration, that suggest that the same  elites were practicing both strategies at different times.  I follow this with a consideration of ethnographic data  that help to elucidate how the balance between these  conflicting strategies may have changed over time. I  round this out with a discussion of the major foci for  conflict and how both elites and nonelites could have  navigated these issues.

PaSt reSearch into the Political organization  oF the late Formative/early claSSic Western highland Mexico (the modern states of Jalisco, Colima, and  Nayarit) is one of the regions of Mesoamerica that has been most negatively  affected by the shamanism model discussed in Kurnick’s introductory chapter.  Peter Furst (1966) introduced the model in the mid-1960s as an alternative to  what he stated was the strongly secular approach used at the time to interpret  the ceramic figures looted from the shaft tombs of the western states (ca. 300  bce–500 ce). According to Furst, the hollow figures that populate museum  and private collections worldwide depict an all-pervading shamanism enacted  through peyote-induced animal transformations (e.g., Furst 1972, 1974, 1975).  The academic and nonacademic influences on this model have been dissected  elsewhere (Fikes 1993; Klein et al. 2002), but these critiques have made dis- appointingly limited headway among academics or museum exhibitors. Yet  empirically speaking, the shamanism model always broke upon the shoals of  local data. Interpretations of the shaft tomb figures in terms of Mesoamerican  98 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="3"> beliefs and practices had been made since at least the 1940s (Bernal 1949;  Corona Nuñez 1955; Toscano 1946). Furthermore, other interpretations of the  proposed shamanic features are more in accordance with what we know of  Mesoamerican ethnography, archaeology, and belief systems that avoid the  imprecision of the shaman concept (Beekman in preparation). Alternate explanations for the emergence of complex societies in western  highland Mexico emerged in the 1980s, stemming primarily from archaeo- logical fieldwork that found substantial public architecture associated with the  shaft tombs. Phil C. Weigand’s archaeological research in central Jalisco took  a decidedly political economic perspective and associated the emergence of  complex society there with the availability of obsidian and other less prominent  minerals (e.g., Weigand 1985a). He became particularly interested in obsidian  as a potentially strategic resource whose access, production, or exchange may  have been under political control (Spence et al. 2002). Weigand and other  researchers however have recorded the presence of several dozen easily acces- sible quality obsidian sources within the Tequila valleys alone (Esparza López  2004, 2008; Esparza López and Ponce Ordaz 2005; Weigand et al. 2002);  direct control over sources would have been impossible. The highly expedient  nature of lithic technology in the region (e.g., prismatic blade technology was  not adopted until the Postclassic Period [900–1600 ce]) also argues against  any special production techniques that might have been monopolized. Mark Miller Graham (1998) was the first art historian to incorporate the  updated archaeology into his interpretations, and he brought more current  approaches to iconographic analysis to bear on the hollow figures. He argued  that political elites may have associated themselves with agricultural fertil- ity and success, drawing upon a familiar Mesoamerican political formula in  which political elites claimed the position of exclusive mediator between  humans and the supernatural (Houston and Stuart 1996; Joyce 2000). I initially drew upon this perspective in my studies of the symbolism of  the public architecture of central Jalisco (Beekman 2003a, 2003b). The guachi- montón temple groups are distinctive circular arrangements of usually eight  rectangular platforms facing a circular patio with a central round altar or pyra- mid. As in many areas of Mesoamerica (e.g., Joyce 2000; Sugiyama 1993), the  architecture represents the Mesoamerican cosmos. The patio symbolizes the  current world, the shaft tombs occasionally beneath the surrounding platforms  vividly represent the underworld, and the central pyramid (sometimes the base  for a vertical pole) was a link to the heavens (Kelley 1974; Beekman 2003a). I  further interpreted the guachimontones as representations of a form of maize  known to have emerged in western Mexico around the Late Formative Period  CONFLICTING POLITICAL STRATEGIES IN CENTRAL JALISCO 99 </page> <page sequence="4"> (300 bce–200 ce) (Beekman 2003b, 2009). In accord with these interpreta- tions, ceramic dioramas looted from the shaft tombs depict the architecture  of the site as places of public performance, particularly feasting and a maize  ceremony associated with the central pole (Beekman 2000, 2003a, 2003b;  Butterwick 1998). In sum, there is good reason to see the guachimontón form  as a highly sacred space appropriate for public ritual. As the argument goes  elsewhere in Mesoamerica, those elites who controlled such spaces through  the possession of sacred knowledge could claim to be the mediators between  humans and the supernatural. A Classic Lowland Maya ruler could reason- ably make this claim, as only a single royal dynast held power at any one  time. The situation in the Tequila valleys was considerably more complex and  should lead archaeologists in other areas to reassess current assumptions about  a royal monopoly on sacred authority on the one hand, and the room for resis- tance possessed by commoners on the other. the tequila valleyS oF central jaliSco During the Late Formative and Classic Periods (300 bce–500 ce), social  complexity in the Tequila valleys accelerated in a manner not seen in neigh- boring areas of western highland Mexico. The local environment is distinctive  for its concentration of both extensive farmland and lakes or wetlands around  the Tequila Volcano. The region experiences a strongly dichotomized rainy  season and a dry season that focused most agricultural activity into the period  from June through November (Beekman and Baden 2011). Fish and fowl  associated with the Laguna Magdalena and wetlands provided other subsis- tence opportunities throughout the year. Out of a hazily understood Middle  Formative base of family tombs and burial mounds, the Teuchitlán culture  emerged (see figure 4.1). The ceremonial centers known from the Tequila val- leys include residential architecture, ballcourts, circular temple groups known  as guachimontones, and deep shaft and chamber family tombs occurring as  isolates or in cemeteries (figure 4.2). In a companion piece to this chapter (Beekman in press), I analyzed the  spatial characteristics and performance activities associated with each type of  formal architecture in terms of the exclusionary and corporate political strate- gies defined by Blanton et al. (1996). In their original model, the former strat- egy seeks to aggrandize a family, dynasty, ruler, etc. through the expression of  difference, using myth, material culture, social rules, group endogamy, etc. The  corporate strategy stresses inclusiveness and ideologies that promote commu- nity well-being through reference to cosmic values, though not necessarily by  100 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="5"> Figure 4.2. Examples of each of the forms of built space proposed to be associated with  specific social institutions and strategies: (a) shaft tomb; (b) guachimontón; (c) ballcourt; (d)  elite residential group (images taken from Beekman 2005a:figures 4.2, 4.4, courtesy of the  Tequila Valley Regional Archaeological Project).  eschewing social hierarchy. The authors of the original study stress the incom- patibility of the two strategies and their concomitant temporal or spatial sepa- ration (Blanton et al. 1996:7). Maurice Bloch (1975) examined a similar contradiction; he questioned how  traditional political oratory that drew upon the formalized rules of speech  could propose novel plans that required divergence from those same rules.  Bloch found that the contradictions between them required some kind of  separation between the two speech events. The separation could be temporal,  CONFLICTING POLITICAL STRATEGIES IN CENTRAL JALISCO 101 </page> <page sequence="6"> with both formal and informal parts to a speech. The two roles could be sepa- rated into two individuals, as between priests and rulers or between presidents  and prime ministers. The first option is inaccessible to archaeologists and the  second might potentially be addressed through studies of burials or imagery.  But a third option is the separation of traditional and novel political oratory  into entirely separate speech events (Bloch 1975:26–28). Bloch’s focus is on  language and oratory, of course, and not necessarily on the material and spatial  component that draws the attention of archaeologists. But, we can consider  the possibility that traditional and more innovative speech events took place  in different dedicated spaces. This possibility is available to us archaeologically,  and my analysis of built space in terms of distinct strategies can be summa- rized briefly. Those forms of architectural space that I (Beekman in press) associated  with an exclusionary strategy were places in which lineages were celebrated  in dramatic fashion. Mortuary ritual was a public event depicted in ceramic  models from the region (figure 4.3). The family tombs were often reused and  could include offerings quantitatively and qualitatively superior to anything  known from other excavated contexts (Galván Villegas 1991; Ramos de la  Vega and López Mestas 1996). Burial furniture included fine vessels such as  the Oconahua Red on Cream type, objects made of imported jade or marine  shell, and the hollow ceramic figures that were used for decades to define  the archaeology of western highland Mexico (e.g., Kan et al. 1989). Descent  group ritual thus incorporated rare materialized cultural capital that exhib- ited the wealth and social connections of the family associated with the tomb  (Beekman 2000). Habitation areas are known from the rural hinterland and within the  immediate environs of the ceremonial centers and provide another possible  line of evidence for the aggrandizement of particular families. Drawing upon  those published in the site maps for Llano Grande and Navajas (Beekman  2003a:figure 7, 2005b:figure 8), residential groups can be defined by the pres- ence of those structures arranged around rectilinear patios and their immedi- ate ancillary buildings (cf. Smith 2009, who focuses solely on those with four  structures around a patio). These groups can have from two to eight structures  and display a wide size range. Although one would hesitate to call them pal- aces, a handful of very large and more symmetrical residential groups exist  within major ceremonial centers and, while unexcavated, suggest the efforts of  particular lineages to express their power and access to labor. In contrast, the ballcourts and guachimontones (which are typically  attached to one another) are separate architectural spaces better associated  102 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="7"> Figure 4.3. Ceramic model depicting a burial procession, with pallbearers carrying the  dead (drawing by Kathy Beekman, after von Winning and Hammer 1972:figure 89).  with community rituals and interests. Ballcourts across Mesoamerica were  arenas of controlled competition, in which conflicts could be resolved or com- partmentalized in a socially acceptable manner (Blanco 2009; Gillespie 1991;  Weigand 1991). Secular games could easily be played in open fields, but con- structed ballcourts within the ceremonial centers imply a more public func- tion—indeed, the ballgame across Mesoamerica had cosmic overtones in  which the myths of the gods or the cycles of the cosmos were enacted through  play (Scarborough and Wilcox 1991; Whittington 2001). Far from being asso- ciated with ancestors and the aggrandizement of a family, the ballgame was a  material manifestation of community ritual oriented toward the higher goal  of social and cosmic balance. Even impressive athletic prowess in the game  would have been reinterpreted in cosmic terms, and excavations within the  ballcourts have found modestly decorated ceramics focused on unelaborated  food consumption and human remains associated with sacrifice (Blanco  2009:119–57). As discussed above, the guachimontón architecture was also the  seat of community ritual. Ceramic models depict known agricultural ceremo- nies, and our excavations within the circles have recovered a considerably less  elaborate assemblage than found in the shaft tombs (Beekman 2000, 2008).  The contrast in associated artifacts is all the more striking when one con- siders that some of the lineage tombs are found beneath the guachimontón  CONFLICTING POLITICAL STRATEGIES IN CENTRAL JALISCO 103 </page> <page sequence="8"> architecture (Beekman 1996:159–64, figure 4.4; Long 1966:248–78, figures 8–10;  Ramos de la Vega and López Mestas 1996:126–29, figures 3, 4, 12; Weigand and  Beekman 1998:40, figures 8, 9), underlining how particular forms of built space  were used very differently, even when one was literally on top of the other.  Each formal architectural space was a field in the sense of Pierre Bourdieu  (1990), in which competition over power was bounded by social rules. The circular guachimontón architecture presents an especially illustrative  case. As noted, the architecture was used for agricultural ritual and replicated  the Mesoamerican cosmos. But the elites who could claim a connection to  the architecture and its symbolism were composed of multiple (usually eight)  lineages who each constructed and maintained one of those structures that  formed the outermost concentric circle of the guachimontón (Beekman 2008).  In other words, the individual lineages that aggrandized themselves in ances- tral ritual tied to the shaft tombs also participated in broader community  ritual with distinct and even contradictory goals. Furthermore, since lineages  shared privileged access to this sacred space, no one of them was in a position  to monopolize the tie to the supernatural (for specific potential exceptions, see  Beekman in press). Whether this was truly unique to this region or whether  non-reigning elites in other areas of Mesoamerica may have held more clout  than we usually assume is obscured by elite monopolization of writing, sculp- ture, and other forms of social mass media in those areas. The social institutions present in the Late Formative to Early Classic  Tequila valleys included both those oriented toward the aggrandizement of  individual lineages and others that stressed the needs of the entire commu- nity, and they show intriguing patterns when one examines their distribution  across the landscape (Beekman in press). While these contrasts were partly  smoothed over through the separation of the opposing strategies into differ- ent forms of built space (cf. Fogelin 2011), this was not completely successful  in the case of the shaft tombs and the guachimontones. Indeed, the presence  of family tombs beneath the satellite structures of the guachimontones makes  it very likely that the same families participated in both ritual series and thus  had to represent lineage and community interests at different times. One may  have even been dependent upon the other. For example, lineage elites may  have been forced to link themselves to the community in some way to fully  legitimize themselves as descent groups. The contradictions are evident, and  the resulting cognitive dissonance (Festinger et al. 1955) would have impacted  not only elites but also followers attempting to navigate these conflicting  messages. While the archaeological record documents these opposing descent  group and community strategies, ethnohistoric and ethnographic data from  104 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="9"> the region help explain how the tensions between them could produce their  own internal dynamic over time, and how some of those contradictions might  have been mitigated. Social contradictionS among the  náyari oF weStern mexico Ethnographic research in western highland Mexico has diversified in  recent years to consider more broadly the Náyari (Cora), Wixarika (Huichol),  Tepecano, and others from northern Jalisco and Nayarit and to place them  more effectively within a historic context (Coyle 2001; Fikes 1985; Jáuregui  and Neurath 2003; Magriña 2002; Neurath 2005, 2008). Older sources have  been rediscovered, republished, and incorporated into a more dynamic under- standing of the social and ceremonial systems of these groups (Diguet 1992;  Lumholtz 1902; Preuss 1998; Seler 1993; Zingg 1988). The indigenous peoples of this mountainous region are the most plausible  known descendants and heirs of the Teuchitlán culture to the south. A num- ber of studies have compared archaeological and ethnographic evidence for  specific rituals, religious symbolism, temple architecture, and sociopolitical  organization (Beekman 2003a, 2003b, 2005b; Neurath 2000; Weigand 1985b,  1996). Among the better substantiated parallels is the practice of communal  rituals in sacred spaces, subdivided into areas built by and/or associated with  different lineages. Past comparisons focused heavily on the Wixarika to the  exclusion of other groups (e.g., Furst 1966, 1972, 1974, 1977), but here I draw  upon ethnographic work among the Náyari. This is not the place to delve into  the specifics of past-present analogies, and my aim is merely to use a similar  case of internal social conflict to illustrate the contradictions likely to have  been present in the archaeological case described above. Anthropologists warn  against using traditional societies in uncritical comparisons with the past. I  strive to respect those issues here while simultaneously recognizing the value  of understanding the descendants of those cultures being studied. The Náyari occupy an isolated and dissected upland landscape in Nayarit  known as the Gran Nayar. They live in scattered farmsteads and in the few  communities of Mesa del Nayar, Santa Teresa, and Jesús María. Similar to  their Maya counterparts at the opposite end of Mesoamerica (though receiv- ing, sadly, much less scholarly attention), the Náyari were not conquered  by the Spanish until 1722. Their temple to the Sun (Tonatí) was destroyed  and the mummified remains of past rulers were taken from a nearby cave  and burned (Malvido Miranda 2000). The temple to the sun may suggest  CONFLICTING POLITICAL STRATEGIES IN CENTRAL JALISCO 105 </page> <page sequence="10"> a community-oriented role, while the physical separation of the remains of  the ruling dynasty into a cave points to special treatment of a family and  ancestral rituals, perhaps symbolically related to the burials in the much ear- lier artificial caves of the shaft tombs. In the following centuries, the Náyari  continued to practice an annual ritual cycle very similar to that followed  by descent groups today (Coyle 2001:76–86). By the end of the nineteenth  century, however, descent group rituals existed in dynamic opposition with  community-oriented ceremonies that closely interwove both traditional and  Catholic elements. Philip E. Coyle suggests that similar community ceremo- nialism existed in the past but had been centered on the capital at Mesa del  Tonatí, whereas today each town has its own complement of community ritual. Coyle describes the tension between descent group and community-level  authorities among the late twentieth-century Náyari of Santa Teresa and  how external interference further fanned the flame. His (Coyle 2001:26–73)  description of descent group ceremonialism invites comparison to the Late  Formative to Early Classic ceremonies associated with lineages and their shaft  tombs. Individual Náyari participate in the ceremonial cycle of one or more  descent groups to which they can claim kinship. Members receive bundles  of maize specific to their descent group(s) and participate in a series of three  major annual ceremonies, or mitotes, that celebrate the planting and harvest  of maize. Descent group rites of passage are nested within these maize cer- emonies, and children, male and female adults, and group ancestors all play a  role at different points of the year. Ancestors become equated with the rains  that support maize farming, but specifically for the lands held by that descent  group. Indeed, individuals obtain access to land through their attachment to  one or more groups. Membership in a group and the concomitant partici- pation in its descent group ceremonialism are therefore critical to the social  identity and physical survival of people relying on subsistence agriculture. Community rituals, on the other hand, are the primary route by which  lineage elders can extend their authority to wider segments of the community.  Community rituals incorporated two authority structures: one that “scales up”  the metaphors of descent group ritual to the community level and another  based on the well-known cargo system of Mesoamerica (Coyle 2001:96–176).  The senior community elder is in charge of the first of these ritual series,  which draws upon many of the same metaphors found in descent group ritual  to bind individuals to their community rather than to their descent groups.  For example, while the ritual actions of ceremonial elders of each of the lin- eages are responsible for bringing rain to their descent group territory, the  ceremonial elders active in the community mitotes are considered responsible  106 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="11"> for ensuring the entire dry season-rainy season cycle. They are thus of another  order with greater authority and responsibilities that are a closer match to the  Late Formative and Early Classic temple rituals of central Jalisco. The cargo  system rituals fuse Christian myths about Jesus with Náyari culture hero  twins Xuráve and Sáutari (Coyle 2001:115–24). Descent group elders together  form a council that runs the cargo system, and therefore hold leading roles  in the ceremonies for their own descent groups and simultaneously for the  larger community. Both lineage and community rituals are associated with a complement of  material objects, symbols, and sacred spaces with notable similarities to the  archaeological record. Descent group rituals are performed in prepared plazas  close to the home of the group’s ceremonial elder. Decorated gourd bowls  are used as containers for maize or sacred waters collected from throughout  the group’s territory and used in ritual. Much like the pre-Columbian vessels  found in tombs or ritual centers, the gourd bowls are decorated with quad- ripartite motifs that are explicitly described by Náyari informants as nested  representations simultaneously of the cosmos and of the circular mitote pla- zas (figure 4.4). The bowl becomes a means of communication with the ances- tors during ritual by moving it up a series of steps over the course of a mitote,  and one can easily see how something similar might have been done on the  stepped guachimontón pyramids. Prayer arrows, maguey liquor, tobacco,  quartz crystals, and beads all play a role in the ceremonies, and potential  correlates exist for all of them either in the excavation record from Llano  Grande or Navajas or in contemporary ceramic figures that depict individuals  smoking or drinking (Beekman 2005b; Butterwick 2004; Cabrero García and  López Cruz 1997). The community-level mitotes are scaled up from the descent group rituals,  in an attempt to stress their more universal claims. Mitotes are practiced in a  sacred locale close to the town of Santa Teresa and separate from the homes  of descent group elders (perhaps the plaza depicted in Lumholtz 1902, 2: 519).  The water collected for the rites comes from different parts of the community  territory rather than descent group lands. Descent group maize bundles are  substituted with bundles of maize grown in the town’s communal garden and  greater use is made of the more cosmic symbol of the cross representing the  four directions. Chánaka poles are raised in the center of sacred grounds as an  explicit representation of the cosmos, in a clear parallel to the poles erected  in the pre-Columbian guachimontones. Few of these materialized symbols  are exclusive to either descent group or community ritual, and the expanded  meanings attributed to them are most important to Coyle’s analysis. CONFLICTING POLITICAL STRATEGIES IN CENTRAL JALISCO 107 </page> <page sequence="12"> Figure 4.4. A design within a votive bowl used in Náyari temples and the explicit  symbolism embodied in the design (after the reprint of Preuss 1998:408–9, figure 3a).  This summary only covers the essentials of Coyle’s analysis but serves to  demonstrate two major points: the notable parallels between the modern  Náyari and the Teuchitlán culture of Jalisco and the origins in deep time of  the conflict between descent group and community interests being acted out  108 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="13"> among the modern Náyari. Prior to the 1722 conquest of the Cora, descent  group interests appear to have been paramount and focused on the central fig- ure of the ruler at Mesa del Tonatí. Spanish authorities dismantled this layer  of political organization and that of individual communities without replac- ing them with effective religious or political authority, allowing local descent  group ceremonialism to dominate until a resurgence of community organiza- tion and ritual took place over the course of the nineteenth century. Coyle’s  (2001:177–240) research addresses how sharp but intermittent interference by  federal agencies with U.S. backing during the twentieth century has increased  the presence of the distant Mexican state and eroded the legitimacy of com- munity authority structures, all while feeding local violence. The oscillations  between different political interests have occurred on a historic or archaeo- logical timescale and resemble the temporal cycling between strategies recog- nized earlier by Richard E. Blanton and his colleagues (Blanton et al. 1996).  The twentieth century was marked by the addition of an entirely new scale of  political activity, as the centuries-old field of conflict has been disrupted by the  external demands of distant political authorities. diScuSSion and concluSionS The ethnographic example explored here provides a more dynamic view of  the archaeological case study but without insisting that the modern Náyari  are necessarily the direct descendants of the Teuchitlán culture. Rather, the  community of Santa Teresa presents a similar field of power (Bourdieu 1990)  to that from pre-Columbian central Jalisco, with sacred spaces dedicated to  different forms of performative ritual that competed for followers’ attention  and support of different political authorities. Descent group elders carried  out ceremonies that highlighted membership in the group, while commu- nity elders (who were, in turn, lineage elders as well) performed rituals that  stressed broader unifying interests. Community support of one or the other  could enable or deny ritual specialists’ efforts to extend their authority over  groups other than their own lineages. It is the clash between different political  strategies that is held in common between the present and the past, and Coyle  documents how the dominance of community or lineage interests may tip one  way or the other over time due to both internal dynamics and external impacts. In considering the relevance of this material to the goals of this volume,  I will focus on three intertwined themes present in the archaeological and  ethnographic cases presented here: access to property through group mem- bership, appeals to symbolic meanings as the basis for legitimacy, and the  CONFLICTING POLITICAL STRATEGIES IN CENTRAL JALISCO 109 </page> <page sequence="14"> affective qualities of performance. Outside of private ownership, individuals  commonly obtain access to capital such as land, titles, sacred knowledge, hunt- ing grounds, etc. through their membership in corporate groups (Beekman  2005a). Their primary mechanisms of recruitment (such as descent or alliance)  have traditionally been used in anthropology to distinguish them as lineages  (Evans-Pritchard 1940), houses (Lévi-Strauss 1982), etc., but the group’s role  in enabling access to corporate property (Carsten and Hugh-Jones 1995;  Watanabe 2004) deserves more attention. Individuals could probably claim  membership in the lineages described in my prehistoric case in much the  same way that they could to the descent groups among the Náyari—by tracing  ties of genealogy or fictive kinship to one or more groups. Some families held  access to land while others held title to sacred knowledge; or perhaps it was  a subset of a descent group that held myths and rituals in secret. But descent  group rituals such as rite of passage ceremonies or mortuary ritual would have  constantly reaffirmed the boundaries of that group and identified those who  could continue to access corporate property by their active participation in  group events and perhaps physical proximity to other members. The motiva- tion for “followers” (or members) of the descent group was comparatively clear,  as their continuing presence at events was necessary to ensure their access  to capital, thereby reproducing the authority of group leaders. It is notewor- thy that in the Náyari case, individuals traced descent via multiple pathways,  allowing them some flexibility as to which groups they would continue to  support. Therefore, the decision of these followers is not so much to follow as  it is whether to maintain social ties to one group or another. The inducements to identify with broader community interests and support  community authorities are distinct. Coyle (personal communication 2014)  notes that the Jesuits established a communal garden and cattle herd in the  center of Santa Teresa, and these supplied maize and meat for the communal  authorities. But this only establishes the source for financing the community  ritual series rather than a form of capital that becomes accessible to partici- pants. More important to my mind is Coyle’s subsequent observation that  participation in ritual at this scale is tied to one’s very existence as a Náyari of  Santa Teresa. Failure to participate marginalizes one as a member, though the  ability of the authorities to enforce this in some concrete manner would seem  to be a critical variable. For these reasons, I would argue that more durable  community authority would require leaders to offer something more concrete  for those who support community ritual (such as burial within the community  gave access to formal citizenship in classical Athens [Morris 1991:157–58]). The  useful part of this discussion is that it prompts us to ask what community  110 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="15"> leaders in the Late Formative/Early Classic provided that drew in follow- ers who already had access to land through their lineage membership. Did  community leaders obtain independent rights to conquered lands, convinc- ingly establish exclusive links to higher ranks of the supernatural, as described  by Joanne Baron (this volume), or provide other inducements to community  members? We do not know, but these are worthy topics of research. The value  of community affiliation, and hence the importance of civic leaders, can also  be destabilized from above if a higher level of political organization were to  abrogate community powers or resources to itself. In the case of the Náyari,  distant governments with pretensions to authority in the area have frequently  played a role in delegitimizing community leaders, actions that should result  in a decline in participation in community ritual. The second issue is the cross-legitimization of community and descent  group interests. Coyle’s Náyari example assumes that descent groups and their  rituals are the more primal form of social organization and predate commu- nity authorities. Hence, community leaders draw upon prior descent group  symbolism to legitimize their more expansive yet historically ephemeral posi- tions. But archaeologists typically assume the opposite in their treatment of  the rise of Mesoamerican elites. If a community already existed as a meaning- ful social entity, emerging descent group elites may have sought to legitimize  their own positions through reference to the established suite of meanings  associated with the community. We may or may not be able to identify the  arrow of causality in this chicken-and-egg problem, but the close proximity of  opposed forms of built space associated with distinct strategies suggests that  some form of cross-legitimization was at work. Lineage-based shaft tombs  have been found beneath some guachimontones, despite the very different  interests represented—elites associated with one may have sought to draw  upon the legitimacy of the other in order to achieve social acceptance as lin- eage elites sought to bootstrap their authority upward over the community as  a whole. The same might be said for the very largest elite residential groups,  which are prominently located within the central areas of ceremonial centers.  Were these built only after one or more descent groups succeeded in making  inroads toward acceptance, or did community leaders purporting to control  wider aspects of the supernatural through ritual borrow from the authority  previously associated with the elders of each descent group? The final issue is the cultivation of affective ties between elites and follow- ers through performance (Inomata, this volume; Inomata and Coben 2006;  Smith 2000). Access to land or other capital is an important consideration in  determining whether someone will associate with a group, but the fact that  CONFLICTING POLITICAL STRATEGIES IN CENTRAL JALISCO 111 </page> <page sequence="16"> the Náyari of Santa Teresa are free to choose between different descent groups  suggests that other factors play a role in their decision to select one or another.  The aesthetic aspects of public performance may be one of these factors, and  exclusionary or communal rituals could generate ties of affect through an  appeal to small and familiar or large and inclusive audiences, respectively.  Thus, the very limited space associated with shaft tombs in comparison to gua- chimontones or ballcourts implies that only a small subset of the community  could ever have participated fully in ancestral rituals (Beekman 2000), and  they, in fact, derived their power from that greater intimacy. Georg Simmel  (1971[1908]) once suggested that the desires for imitation and differentiation  are present in all individuals, and people could have been attracted equally to  exclusive and inclusive rituals. Whatever the size of the audience, ritual must be carried out in reference  to tradition in order to be recognized by the supernatural powers to which  it is addressed (Coyle 2001:14). But in order to meet with the approval of its  human audience, ritual must be performed in ways that are novel, aesthetically  interesting, and engaging. In the case of the Náyari, much the same symbolism  exists in both descent group and community ritual, with the difference being  primarily one of scale. Both sets of rituals propitiated rain, but the first does  so through requests to the ancestors of the descent group while the second  claims responsibility for the dry-rainy season cycle. This raises the question  “When is ritual sufficiently different in its claims of efficacy to attract the par- ticipation of members?” Compliance can lead to further participation in ritual,  reproducing the authority of the lineage or community leaders. But a failure  to engage can lead to a decline in follower participation and legitimacy, just  as is currently taking place in Santa Teresa. The most extreme result may be a  catastrophic loss of support and physical relocation (Houston et al. 2003), and  it is the perpetuation or cessation of performance that is our best archaeologi- cal evidence for the success or failure to engage the emotions of the audience. The three themes considered here thus isolate potential areas of conflict  between descent group and communal authorities and interests: socially  defined access to resources, the concepts and meanings that legitimize the  holders of these resources, and the theatrical attempts to create emotional  bonds between leaders and supporters. Lineage and community leaders each  likely sought to associate their groups with material or spiritual resources  that were either different in scale or in kind. Newer groups likely borrowed  from existing concepts of legitimacy in their attempts to establish them- selves and achieve acceptance, whether by attempting to co-opt meanings or  through associating themselves with acknowledged sacred spaces. Their use  112 BEEKMAN </page> <page sequence="17"> of performance and theater to create emotional bonds with audiences was  a further area of potential conflict in the contrasting appeals that might be  made toward exclusiveness or inclusiveness. Supporters were in the position  of selecting among the options presented to them and thereby reproducing  one form of authority or another, but they may have found it far more difficult  to opt out of the system altogether if they wished to maintain access to land  and social relationships. Theoretical arguments that emphasize the power held  by commoners in social negotiation may be assuming independent access to  lands and hence a degree of autonomy from the distant wranglings among  political elites, but individuals may actually have been very dependent upon  membership in communal groups for their social and physical survival. Strategies that appear to contradict one another can be massaged through  the efforts of both elites and members/followers so that those contradictions  become less apparent even as they remain unresolved. They may be spatially  separated into different forms of built space. Innovations in ritual can gradu- ally fuse Christianity and native religion or appropriate and alter the claims  of lineage elders to control aspects of the environment. Those elites seeking  to establish competing claims to community leadership may need to offer  something different from lineage elders in order to stabilize their authority.  Conflicts do not need to be resolved, but neither are they left unaddressed. acknowledgmentS Thanks go to the National Science Foundation and the University of  Colorado Denver for their support of field research in central Jalisco. I would  like to thank Philip (Ted) Coyle for discussions of the Náyari and for his  interest in bridging archaeology and cultural anthropology. I would also like  to express my appreciation to the editors for presenting us with a stimulating  framework for thinking about our data. reFerenceS Beekman, Christopher S. 1996. “The Long-Term Evolution of a Political Boundary:  Archaeological Research in Jalisco, México.” PhD diss., Vanderbilt University.
