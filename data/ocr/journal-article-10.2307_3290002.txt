Dunn, University of Oregon, Eugene, Ore. This department will present everything that is properly news of general appeal, but considerations of space compel the editors to ask that items be made as brief as possible. Whenever feasible, it is preferable to print programs of meetings which would draw an attendance from a large area as live news in advance of the date rather than as dead news after the event. In this connection it should be remembered that the November issue, e.g., appears on October fifteenth and that items must be in hand five or six weeks in advance of this date.] Association Guillaume Bud6 The Association Guillaume Bud6, whose activities in other parts of the classical field are well known, has issued invitations for a Congress to be held at Nimes, France, March 28-April 2, 1932.

Magazine Readers Must Know the Classics In "The Classics and the Modern Magazine," School and Society xxxIv (1931), 599-605 Muriel L. Guberlet of the University of Washing- ton analyzed the contents of certain high-grade magazine articles pub- lished in the year just before the World War and also in a more recent year. In the field of the ancient classics the author presented the follow- ing conclusions (p. 604): "The reader cannot be content with knowing something of mediaeval and modern European and American literature, but he must have pigeonholed in his mind a generous knowledge of Greek and Roman writings, for 225 references were made to the classical</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT EVENTS 557 period. Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were mentioned many times in each issue of the magazine, as were Aristotle's Ethics and Politics; but the contributors also demand that the readers be familiar with Theocritus, the Greek Anthology, . . . Ovid's Tristia, Aeschylus' Oresteia, Apuleius' Ass of Gold, Aristophanes' Lysistrata, and the works of thirty-five other authors. Likewise more than one hundred allusions were made to Greek and Roman mythological characters. A number of studies have shown that it is futile to use a dictionary or encyclopedia in trying to under- stand allusions to mythology; they must be learned in context to have any real meaning. The classical mythology is lovely and symbolic and should be so well learned in childhood that references to it open up a whole treasure gallery of stirring and dramatic pictures." Classical Association of Virginia The Classical Association of Virginia met at Richmond on November 27, 1931, under the presidency of Mrs. P. W. Hiden of Newport News. The following program of papers was presented: "The Cash Value of the Classics" by Miles S. Masters of Roanoke College; "Why Latin?" by D. C. Wilson of Hampden-Sydney College; a round table entitled "Latin Composition in the Fourth Year" by R. W. House of Salem, Sister M. Rose of Richmond, Thelma Runyon of Fredericksburg, and Elizabeth Hudson of Syringa; "Classical Organizations" by Sallie Lovelace of Roanoke; "The Functional Approach to the Teaching of Latin Vocabulary, Forms, and Syntax" by W. L. Carr of Columbia University; and tournament papers by Elizabeth Saunders of Newport News, D. C. Wilson of Hampden-Sydney College, W. A. Montgomery of the University of Virginia, and H. C. Lipscomb of Randolph-Macon Woman's College. Elizabeth A. Saunders of Newport News was elected secretary for 1932. A loan fund of one hundred dollars for any Virginia teacher of classics in a secondary school for the 1932 summer session at the American Academy in Rome or the American School in Athens was inaugurated. The Association likewise began plans for the third state-wide Latin tournament. The growth of the tournament has been phenomenal in its two years; in 1931 over ninety schools participated, almost twice the number of those that took part in 1930.</page></plain_text>
