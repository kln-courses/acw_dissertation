<plain_text><page sequence="1">IOLENCE AND REPRESENTATION IN THE MYTHICAL TEXT m RENE GIRARD Many myths pretend to account for the birth of the cultural order to which they belong. According to Levi-Strauss this claim is necessarily spurious since even modern anthropology must give up the search for origins. As a result, the dramatic elements of mythology do not interest Levi-Strauss as such. He has little patience for the students of mythology who focus their attention on those aspects. He is aware, however, of the obvious similarities between myths even very dis- tant from each other. In order to fulfill his project of a scientific theory of myth, he must somehow account for these. In his famous article on the Oedipus myth, he developed a view of the hero as a mediator between contradictory propositions. This view has be- come extremely popular even though or perhaps because it is only a Hegelianized version of the XIXth century conception of mythol- ogy as philosophie sauvage. Obviously less satisfied with this theory than his followers, Levi- Strauss, in Totemism, attempts a second synthesis which in my opin- ion is no more successful than the first but is much more interesting even though, to my knowledge at least, it has received almost no critical attention. This second treatment rests primarily on two examples. One is the Ojibwa myth from which modern anthropology has borrowed the word "totemism." The second comes from Tikopia, in Poly- nesia, and it also deals with the alleged origin of a so-called totemic system. In The Raw and the Cooked, the whole interpretation is reworked and completed apropos of a Bororo myth. Here is the summary of the Ojibwa myth in the English transla- tion of Rodney Needham: A myth explains that the five "original" clans are descended from six anthropomorphic supernatural beings who emerged from the ocean to mingle with human beings. One of them had his eyes covered and dared not look at the Indians, though he showed the MLN 92 (1977) 922-944 Copyright ? 1977 by The Johns Hopkins University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.</page><page sequence="2">M L N 923 greatest anxiety to do so. At last he could no longer restrain his curiosity, and on one occasion he partially lifted his veil, and his eye fell on the form of a human being, who instantly fell dead "as if struck by one of the thunderers." Though the intentions of this dread being were friendly to men, yet the glance of his eye was too strong, and it inflicted certain death. His fellows therefore caused him to return to the bosom of the great water. The five others remained among the Indians, and "became a blessing to them." From them originate the five great clans or totems. .. I Here is now the summary of the second myth, the one from Tikopia: A long time ago the gods were no different from mortals, and the gods were the direct representatives of the clans in the land. It came about that a god from foreign parts, Tikarau, paid a visit to Tikopia, and the gods of the land prepared a splendid feast for him, but first they organized trials of strength or speed, to see whether their guest or they would win. During a race, the stranger slipped and declared that he was injured. Suddenly, however, while he was pretending to limp, he made a dash for the provisions of the feast, grabbed up the heap, and fled for the hills. The family of gods set off in pursuit; Tikarau slipped and fell again, so that the clan gods were able to retrieve some of the provisions, one a coconut, another a taro, another a breadfruit, and others a yam. Tikarau succeeded in reaching the sky with most of the foodstuff for the feast, but these four vegetable foods had been saved for men.2 The two myths have several points in common and the essential one is defined as follows: In both cases, totemism as a system is introduced as what remains of a diminished totality, a fact which may be a way of expressing that the terms of the system are significant only if they are separated from each other, since they alone remain to equip a semantic field which was previously better supplied and into which a discontinuity has been introduced.3 In The Raw and the Cooked, this logical or, more precisely, topological interpretation becomes more explicit. Differentiation, the essential process of human thought, can only be represented as a spacing-out of the entities that must be differentiated. All these myths, Levi-Strauss speculates, posit a totalite originaire so compact, 1 Claude Uvi-Strauss, Totemism (Boston: Beacon Press, 1963), p. 19. 2 Ibid., p. 25. 3 Ibid., p. 26.</page><page sequence="3">924 RENE GIRARD a mass so crowded with elements, at the beginning, that human thought cannot penetrate. So many entities are packed so tightly in a space so small that differentiation cannot take place. In these circumstances, the removal of a few elements, even a single frag- ment, will provide enough free space for differentiation to take place. Continuity will give way to the discontinuity of "human thought": In each case, discontinuity had to be achieved by the radical elimina- tion of certain fractions of the continuum. Once the latter has been reduced, a smaller number of elements are free to spread out in the same space, while the distance between them is now sufficient to prevent them from overlapping or merging into one another.4 Thus, to Levi-Strauss, the mythical drama really boils down to an allegorical dramatization of the thinking process itself, the pro- duction of differences. Myths are not merely structured; they are already structuralist. Unlike Levi-Strauss, however, they can con- ceive of intellectual operations only as real events that take place "at the beginning" and which they regard as the "origin" of the cultural system. The observations of Levi-Strauss are correct. Something like a "radical elimination" does really constitute the high point in the mythical drama and it is supposed to play a crucial role in the establishment of the cultural order. The common denominator is real and it belongs not only to the two myths analysed in Totemism but to many others. But the topological model invented by Levi- Strauss does not account for that common denominator; it does not even always agree with the mythical data. The eliminated fragment must belong to the so-called totalite originaire, otherwise its elimination will not provide more space than was available at the beginning. If the fragment is extraneous, if it enters the totality after it is constituted, its elimination will cure, perhaps, whatever disturbances the presence of that foreign body may have caused but it will not modify the situation that prevailed originally as far as space is concerned; it will merely restore that original situation. In order to find out if the eliminated fragment truly belongs to the totalit6 originaire, we must know, of course, what this fragment 4 Claude Uvi-Strauss, The Raw and the Cooked (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), p. 52.</page><page sequence="4">M L N 925 or fragments consist of. In his analysis of the Tikopia myth, Levi-Strauss seems to refer to those unspecified totemic goods which Tikarau manages to steal away. But what about Tikarau himself? He, too, is radically eliminated. The general make-up and vocabulary of the so-called structural analysis suggest a world of inanimate objects but this is somewhat deceptive since, in the case of the Ojibwa myth, the only possible candidate for the role of eliminated fragment is the god sent back into the deep as a punishment for lifting his veil and killing one member of the community. Levi-Strauss himself underlines the similarities be- tween the two gods; in both myths, a greedy and indiscreet action by one of these gods triggers the elimination which, in turn, triggers the totemic differentiation. In each myth, the god himself is eliminated. If we assume, as we must, that the totalite originaire signifies whatever ensemble or community comes first in the mythical sequence it is evident that neither one of our divine malefactors belongs to it. In the Ojibwa myth, the human community comes first. The six supernatural beings may well form ltnother totality but they are defined as outsiders; they come into the human community as visitors from another world. In the myth from Tikopia there is only one totality and we are told quite explicitly that Tikarau does not belong to it. Levi-Strauss himself describes Tikarau as "un dieu etranger." Rodney Needham translates this as "a god from foreign parts." The phrase reminds one of Levi-Strauss's own source, Raymond Firth, in Tikopia Ritual and Belief: "Tikarau came to the land of Tikopia from foreign parts."5 It is not my purpose to prove that the "eliminated fragment," as a rule, does not belong to the original totality. In some cases it does, in other cases it does not; other cases still are ambiguous or handled in such a way as to make the spatial reduction of the mythical drama unlikely at best. Oedipus, for instance, can be defined as an "eliminated," even twice eliminated fragment; he really does belong to the totalite originaire; he was born, in other words, in the city of Thebes, but it would be absurd, obviously, to reduce his comings and goings in and out of that city to their spatial consequences. In many myths, ambiguity prevails and 5 Raymond Firth, Tikopia Ritual and Belief (Boston: Beacon Press, 1967), p. 230.</page><page sequence="5">926 RENE GIRARD makes it impossible to equate the real message of the myth to the neat space-producing device imagined by Levi-Strauss. Even if all textual data agreed with it, the space-producing device would still be unsatisfactory. The problem is not that it does away with all the moral, existential or psychoanalytical values or intuitions which many people attach to mythology and which Levi-Strauss regards with great contempt. The problem is that it does not even account for all the features which Levi-Strauss himself recognizes as common to the two myths he analyzes. Here is one of these features: The same opposition will be noted between individual and collective conduct, the former being negatively regarded and the latter posi- tively in relation to totemism.6 Why should the god-who happens to coincide in both myths with the eliminated fragment-appear as a threat to the com- munity if the only problem is to provide a little more elbow room by unloading some excess baggage? According to Levi-Strauss, the topological scheme which is the real message of the mythical drama is imaginary; it can only be a representation therefore. Why should a representation so bland and so harmless be obscured behind a bizarre indictment of the "eliminated fragment" who also happens to be a god? The paradox of divine misbehavior and "radical elimination" affects not only the two supernatural heroes in the two myths of Totemism but countless other heroes in countless myths all over the world. It is this paradox, really, which reappears even in Aristotle's Poetics under the famous label of hamartia, the tragic flaw which justifies the demise of the hero in the eyes of the crowd and of Aristotle himself, thereby providing us with an exact literary equiv- alent of the "structure" isolated by Levi-Strauss, a collective action that is positively qualified because it radically eliminates the individual responsible for an action that is "negatively qualified." Levi-Strauss himself seems to acknowledge the scope of the problem in the passage immediately following the last one I quoted: "In the two myths," he writes, "the individual and malefi- cent conduct is that of a greedy and inconsiderate god (a point on which there are resemblances with Loki of Scandinavia, of whom a masterly study has been made by Georges Dumezil)." 6 Claude LMvi-Strauss, Totemism, p. 26.</page><page sequence="6">M L N 927 The paradox of divine transgression is still with us. The central enigma of mythology is no less relevant and mysterious than ever for being dressed up in the titillating novelty of a "topological model." This does not mean there are no sound observations in the anal- ysis of Levi-Strauss: even though it is not really scientific, the topological model touches upon a representation which is almost invariably neglected and which is truly central not only to the two myths analysed by Levi-Strauss but to mythology as such. And it is, of course, that "collective action" which is also a "radical elimi- nation" of a threat to the collectivity. If we give up the topological model and retain the observations for which it cannot account, we will realize that the radical elimination truly amounts to collective violence against the delinquent divinity, a kind of lynching. In the Ojibwa myth, we have five individuals acting together in order to get rid of a sixth one, presumably by drowning. In the Tikopia myth, a furious mob hunts down a presumed thief. Why and how should Tikarau fall since he also flies up into the sky? Levi-Strauss towers over such undignified and illogical detail but the question may be answered if we turn to Raymond Firth's Tikopia Ritual and Belief, a book published too late to be used in Totemism.7 According to Firth, Tikarau fell on the crest of a hill, over- hanging a cliff. This can mean, I suppose, that, from the perspec- tive of the myth itself his pursuers caught up with him and made him fall. Still, he "bolted to the edge of the cliff, and being an atua launched himself into the sky and set off for the far lands with his ill-gotten gains." In many societies with no judicial system, the favorite mode of ritual execution is identical with an action which is not really repre- sented in our myth but suggested, or alluded to. The Tarpeian rock in Rome is only one particularly famous example of this action. The plunge over the cliff has important features in com- mon with other widespread modes of ritual execution such as collective stoning, abandonment of the victim in the middle of a desert, or in a bark at sea . . . etc. All these methods permit a community to get rid of an anathe- matized individual with little or none of the direct physical contact that might be dangerous in view of the contagiousness of violence. 7Raymond Firth, Tikopia Ritual and Belief, p. 230.</page><page sequence="7">928 RENE GIRARD Participation is minimal and at the same time it is collective. The responsibility for the death of the victim rests upon no one in particular and this is an added advantage: the chances of further division in the community are diminished. In the case of the cliff, the community's role can be almost entirely passive. It consists in blocking all avenues of escape except over the cliff. Quite frequently the victim will become so panicked that he will not have to be pushed. Like Tikarau, he will appear to hurl himself into the sky of his own volition. In the case of Tikarau, we do not know what happened but we may assume that the victim, were he not an atua, meaning spirit or a god, would meet his death rather than fly away. Even if the first fall were not fatal, the second one inevitably would be. This point is crucial, I believe, and it does not really matter if the myth blurs it; the blurring itself fits very well with the ominous context which the whole scene cannot fail to evoke. Like the sacred interpretation of mythology by mythology itself -Tikarau flying into the sky-the space-producing device of Levi- Strauss is another transfiguration of the collective violence at the heart of the myth, half visible and half hidden, it seems, in all major interpretations. Levi-Strauss is much closer than he thinks with his "radical elimination" to a text he thinks completely alien to his thought, the fourth essay of Totem and Taboo, closer no doubt than any of the current psychoanalytical reading of mythol- ogy, but not close enough to acknowledge his kinship with the best Freud. Levi-Strauss thinks he is "scientific" because he reifies the repre- sentation of a human process: he reduces men to inanimate objects, mere elements and fragments in a purely spatial field. This dehu- manized language of which he is so proud makes it impossible for him fully to perceive the representation that must be revealed, at the center of mythology, in order to make a truly scientific theory possible. If we test the "topological" model on a still mythical but more explicit representation of lynching than the two examples analyzed in Totemism, we will immediately perceive the perfect homology between the two. The Pentheus episode of the Dionysiac cycle, in the dramatic adaptation of The Bacchae, constitutes one such ex- plicit representation of lynching. King Pentheus commits all kinds of impious actions; he spies on the bacchantes. As a result of this</page><page sequence="8">M L N 929 "negatively qualified" action he becomes the wretched "fragment" that is unceremoniously but quite "radically" and efficiently "elimi- nated" by the united bacchantes. This elimination is "positively qualified" in the sense that it fulfills the will of the god and brings order back to the city of Thebes. I do not say that the so-called structural analysis of Totemism must be applied to The Bacchae. I say that The Bacchae must be applied to structuralism. The superior intuition of Euripides may finally force the structuralist to understand what he is talking about. Thanks to Euripides and The Bacchae, we can relate to each other the two very pertinent observations which we have utilized and which remain unrelated in Levi-Strauss. We can understand why the eliminated fragment must commit some action negatively qualified; the elimination is really murder and even the most hysterical murderers do not kill without a motive. The "nega- tively qualified action" really consists of an alleged threat or crime which the collective murder is intended to ward off or punish. Levi-Strauss correctly observes isolated features of the repre- sentation central to mythology but he cannot integrate these fea- tures because he cannot arrive at the lynching process itself. Only through this lynching process will all the isolated features so aptly observed by him crystallize into a single coherent picture. We must not believe that a solution is scientific simply because it presents itself as a "model," or better still as a "topological model." To be scientific is to choose the path that will account for the greatest number of mythical features in the most simple and obvious way. In order to be scientific, therefore, we must first of all acknowledge the representation of lynching which lurks behind the topological model. My purpose is the same as the purpose of Levi-Strauss. It has nothing to do with a "mystique of violence" or other such nonsense. It is certainly impossible to elaborate a scientific theory of myth unless we acknowledge the true nature of the mythical representations. We must now find out if this acknowledgment can help fulfill the goal of Levi-Strauss. First we will turn toward the murder and its motivation. Tikarau is accused of stealing the totemic goods, the whole cultural system in other words. His action threatens the community as a whole and justifies, as a result, or seems to justify the collective nature of the retaliation, the apparently unanimous participation in mur- der. The same is true of the Ojibwa god, really. Thanks only to the rapid intervention of all the other gods, the murderous glance</page><page sequence="9">930 RENE GIRARD of their indiscreet companion kills no more than one member of the community. Potentially at least the whole community is threat- ened, as in the case of Tikarau. It is impossible to steal the cultural order; it is impossible to kill people simply by looking at them. These accusations are fantas- tic and they reappear constantly in mythology. Students treat them from a rationalistic viewpoint as products of religious superstition, from a literary and esthetic viewpoint as products of a gratuitous imagination, from a psychoanalytical viewpoint as symbols of an individual or collective unconscious. No one, to my knowledge, has ever investigated the sociological implications of these same accusations. It is probably felt that they are too fantastic to appear in a real sociological context. This assumption is erroneous. Even today, in communities or milieux which sociologists do not hesitate to call "backward," especially if they belong to the Western world, there exists an equivalent of the mythological power to kill at a glance or to inflict disease and other kinds of misfortune, and it is called the "evil eye." In certain regions of Italy, for instance, belief in the "malocchio" of certain individuals is still common.8 Once it has been suggested that someone has the evil eye, every misfortune which befalls the community as a whole or any of its members can be read as added evidence that the accusation is justified. The tremendous scope and overwhelming vagueness of the "evil eye" make it a formidable charge indeed, which no ra- tional refutation can counter. The exercise of this power does not even have to be voluntary. The good intentions of the Ojibwa god do not save the Indian upon whom his glance happens to fall. The good will of King Oedipus toward the city of Thebes and the involuntary nature of his crimes do not prevent him from spread- ing the plague among his citizens. The discovery of the victim's evil power always comes from the crowd and never from the victim. 8 Please note the similarity between the "evil spying" attributed by the bacchantes to Pentheus, which is the proximate cause of his death, of course, according to the story, and the "evil eye" of the Ojibwa divinity, the "negative action" which triggers his "radical elimination." Evil spying is really the same thing as the evil eye: it is an evil eye emptied in part of its supernatural power, "desacralized" in The Bacchae to the same extent that other mythical themes are desacralized. We should also note the similarity between this "evil spying" and the "peeping Tom" complex always widespread in those cultural areas where collective violence is still simmering beneath the surface.</page><page sequence="10">M L N 931 Why and in what circumstances should such monstrous accusa- tions appear and take hold among human beings who are no more monstrous, presumably, than others? With the advent of the new primitivism it is now fashionable to assume, at least implicitly, that in primitive societies, disruptions of the social order do not occur or that these societies are somehow better able to deal with them than we are. This belief is probably wrong unless we agree that accusations like the evil eye and whatever consequences follow from them constitute the most satisfactory means to solve certain social problems. If a community is deprived of political and legal means to deal with internal divisions and agitations, there will be an irresistible tendency to pin the responsibility for whatever ails it on some individual or individuals close at hand. The specific type of the fantastic that characterizes the accusations against Oedipus, or against the two central characters in the two myths discussed in Totemism, corresponds perfectly to what may be expected when an unmanageable and even undefinable social malaise or crisis is turned into the responsibility of a single individual. Do we have reasons to believe that the preceding considerations could be relevant to mythology? Do we have mythical represen- tations that suggest the social circumstances in which accusations like the evil eye are likely to arise? According to structuralism, of course, we do not. Levi-Strauss describes as a primordial absence of order the state of affairs which prevails at the beginning of many myths. According to him, this state of affairs is characterized by an "undifferentiation" which constitutes a purely logical if not a his- torical starting point for the deployment of human thought. Although it is non-historical, this view remains obviously influ- enced by the creation myth in Genesis and its theological interpre- tations in the Judaeo-Christian world. It takes no account of the conflictual aspects in the narrative elements at the beginning of many primitive myths. These elements suggest violent disorder rather than a mere absence of order, primordial or otherwise. We often have a confused struggle between indistinguishable antago- nists frequently defined as identical twins. If there is enough space for these antagonists to exchange blows, there should be enough too for the differentiation process of human thought. In La Violence et le sacre, I have tried to show that this lack of differenti- ation is no mere logical starting point, but reflects the vicious and undecidable nature of the revenge process; the world of reciprocal</page><page sequence="11">932 RENE GIRARD violence is one of constant mirror effects in which the antagonists become each other's doubles and lose their individual identities. It is true, of course, that at the beginning of myth the whole classification system and, as a result, the whole natural as well as the whole social order appear to be inexistent or in shambles. All I say is that if the emphasis is placed on the conflictual and therefore social aspects of these representations they will provide the type of context in which accusations like the "evil eye" or the "theft" of the entire cultural order by one individual are likely to occur. The theme of conflictual undifferentiation or intense competi- tion is not too explicit in the two myths of Totemism; Levi-Strauss, understandably, does not choose his examples from among those myths which emphasize the aspects I have in mind. In the myth from Tikopia, nevertheless, these aspects are recognizable in those "ordeals of speed and strength" to which Tikarau is supposedly "invited" and which result in his lynching. The festival that turns into a lynching party is another theme common to the myth from Tikopia and The Bacchae. It constitutes, I believe, a partial ritualistic re-framing of the type of social crisis which leads backward communities to seek relief through a polar- ization against a single individual, the very polarization which is represented in the myth as an objective qualification of the victim. Since the crisis is social, it necessarily transcends all individual responsibility and can only be expressed in that form we find in mythology. The victim is endowed with a truly fantastic and super- human power to harm the community. We have now three types of representation that dovetail per- fectly: 1) intimations of a social crisis, 2) the attribution of some- thing like the "evil eye" to some individual, 3) the collective murder of that individual. We have, in other words, the social circum- stances likely to induce collective violence juxtaposed with an accu- sation typical of those societies in which collective violence is en- demic, and all this is immediately followed by an act of collective violence against the victim of this accusation. When I define the "evil eye" or any other version of the victim's fantastic power for evil as an "accusation," I am not true, of course, to the explicit message of the myth. In the perspective of that message, the "evil eye" is not a simple accusation; there is nothing conjectural or hypothetical about it; it is presented as an unques- tionable fact, an unshakeable truth. I say "accusation" somewhat</page><page sequence="12">M L N 933 loosely because this alleged fact is surrounded by other represen- tations that suggest it is neither a fact nor the fruit of a gratuitous imagination, but the kind of collective delusion that appears in the circumstances to which our myths seem to allude, and which are likely to end up in the collective violence that is also represented by those same myths. Between the explicit message of our two myths, therefore, and the implicit or indirect clues we have gathered from an analysis of that message, we have a contradiction. The Ojibwa victim is presented as the only god in the myth who unleashes the terrible power of his "evil eye." Tikarau, in the myth from Tikopia, is presented as the only thief. In both myths, therefore, the malefactor and victim is presented as someone very special. He is the only individualized character in the myth; the only proper name in our two myths belongs to one of these victims, Tikarau. This is the message of the myth; it proclaims the extreme difference, even uniqueness of the victim. If, instead of that message, we listen to the indirect clues, the lynching of the victim will suggest a collective mechanism of projection which must be understood in reference not to the victim, of course, but to the unmanageable and incompletely formulated problems of that collectivity. This means that far from being uniquely differentiated, the victim must be regarded, if not necessarily as random, at least as arbitrary in regard to the real problems of the community. Since nobody, absolutely nobody can have the "evil eye" or steal the totemic system, there is no significant reason why one individual rather than another would become the target of this "accusation." This contradiction is not something which is limited to our two examples or even to a few other myths; it is a basic feature of primitive mythology and its resolution cannot fail to be crucial for the elaboration of the scientific theory of myth which is the unfulfilled ambition of structural ethnology. If we believe the explicit message of the myth, or even if we question that message in the manners now traditional, if we regard it as merely "superstitious" in the style of the rationalists, if we regard it as fantasmatic in the sense of the Freudian unconscious, or if we regard it as an allegory of human thought as Levi-Strauss does, we will always end up once more at the impasse to which these methodologies inevitably lead. Does it mean that our contra- diction will always remain unintelligible and that no scientific</page><page sequence="13">934 RENE GIRARD theory of myth can be formulated? It means nothing of the sort. The explicit message of the myth can still be questioned and criti- cized from a standpoint which has never been tried and which should be the first to be tried since it is suggested by the myth itself. We know very little about the spontaneous mechanisms of collective violence, but we know enough to realize that these mech- anisms do generate the type of collective delusion which our myths represent as an unquestionable fact. It is very easy therefore, to reconcile the thematic elements in mythology which suggest an arbitrary lynching with the thematic elements which assert that this same lynching is fully justified, that the victim is truly endowed with a supernatural power for evil. All we have to do to account for everything is to assume that the lynching is represented from the standpoint of the lynchers themselves. We can be absolutely sure that this perspective will produce all the so-called structures detected by Levi-Strauss, all the narrative common denominators between the two myths analyzed in To- temism. When the lynchers look back at their own lynching they will certainly present it as a positive action, and they will present the action or being of their victim as negative. Only the perspective of the lynchers will tie together the various observations of Levi- Strauss and account for the fact that the oppositions characteristic of the mythical drama, unlike so many others, are not really revers- ible when you shift from myth to myth. Even though the victim turns out in the end to be the divine benefactor of the community, he remains first of all a malefactor; he remains always guilty, in other words, and the lynching is always justified. The perspective of the lynchers recording their own lynching solves every problem, but this perspective cannot arise without real lynchers, of course, and without a real lynching. In order to account for the nature and organization of the mythical themes, we are led to suppose that the mythical text is rooted in an extra- textual event. Until now we have been very careful to treat the mythical representations as purely representations, but their anal- ysis has logically led us to the hypothesis that some of them at least must have a real referent, as the linguist would say. In order to arrive at a truly concrete and efficient theory of the myth we must face the possibility that some of its representations are trust- worthy, at least in principle; the ones that suggest the lynching itself, the ones taking place in the circumstances that are likely to trigger that kind of collective violence.</page><page sequence="14">M L N 935 If we go back and examine the steps which led us to postulate a real lynching, we will observe that all our arguments are textual; at no point did we transgress the most valid rule of modern criti- cism, the one which demands that the sign/fie of a text not be confused with a referent in the real world. Our conclusion that the lynching must be real is nothing of the sort; it is a hypothetical conclusion forced upon us by the results of the purely immanent analysis. This hypothesis is powerful because it and it alone can solve the textual enigma which structuralism and the other theories cannot solve. This hypothesis, I repeat, does not merely consist in saying that since lynching is represented in an enormous number of myths it must somehow take place in the real world. This hypothesis is no illegitimate assimilation or confusion of the signifie with the real world. It is prompted by the constant juxtaposition in mythology of representations that strongly suggest and of representations that explicitly deny a mimetic polarization of violence on an arbitrary victim. It is the text itself, therefore, which demands that hypothe- sis. Only through that hypothesis does the contradiction which is weaved into the very texture of mythology become not only intelli- gible but necessary. Only through that hypothesis do the contents and organization of the mythical themes become understandable and coherent. In the present climate of opinion, however, it is almost impos- sible that the arguments I advance can be heard. A valid methodo- logical principle has been espoused with such fervor that it has turned into a metaphysical dogma. As attempts to elaborate a scientific theory of the sign have given way to a more and more radical critiques of such attempts, the principle of a textuality entirely closed upon itself and for which no extra textual referent and origin can be reached, has become an unchallengeable abso- lute. Like all true believers, the devouts of this absolute are deaf to anything that views their assumptions merely as assumptions. Whatever disturbs their negative faith in the ultimate self-referen- tial nature of all texts will automatically be perceived as a regres- sion toward the old empirical confusion between a sign and its ref- erent. Can I avoid a direct clash with this metaphysical prejudice? Could I not retain the gist of my hypothesis and yet accommodate myself to the current dogma, perhaps by defining the perspective of the myth as one of approval and endorsement vis-a-vis a mere</page><page sequence="15">936 RENE GIRARD representation of lynching rather than the perspective of the lynchers themselves? It cannot be done. A perspective of mere approval would inevi- tably entail that the opposite attitude is also possible, that implicitly at least, it is already part of the mythical perspective. If the myth merely approved, it might also disapprove of the lynching it repre- sents. This is the perspective of a detached spectator or of a reader confronted by a text that is already written; it implies a distance from the scene which is obviously absent in the case of the mythical elaboration. The striking thing about primitive mythology is the constant juxtaposition of thematic elements that suggest entirely different interpretations. Some of these, we found, firmly pin upon the victim the responsibility for whatever misfortunes or catastrophes beset the community; others suggest a vulgar episode of collective violence, a mindless crowd carried away by the mimetic power of its own hysterical paranoia. The only way to account for this constant juxtaposition is to suppose that the elaboration of the text takes place under the continued influence of this mimetic power. Only the lynchers themselves can believe enough in their own lynching to read it as the emergence, in supernaturally trou- bled circumstances, of an all-powerful demonic figure threatening to destroy the entire community and only prevented from doing so by this community's timely violence. The fact that this violence may be presented as the action not of a human but of a divine community which parallels the community of human ancestors, as in the Ojibwa myth, may correspond to the beginning of a distanci- ation, but it does not truly modify the perspective of the myth, the perspective of the lynchers themselves which was inherited by the community of believers. We cannot renounce the definition proposed above. The per- spective of the lynchers implies a real lynching, and it must be that real lynching which is represented not only in the two myths dis- cussed in Totemism but in countless other myths. We cannot accom- modate our hypothesis to current dogma. We will have to challenge that dogma, but we are not going to do it on purely theoretical grounds. A purely theoretical discussion is always a philosophical discussion in disguise, and it can be avoided by introducing into the debate another category of texts which is really very close to the myths we have discussed, but which is not acknowledged as such. The texts I have in mind could be defined as texts of mystified</page><page sequence="16">M L N 937 persecution. These texts range from the documents of medieval and modern anti-Semitism, including violent pogroms, to the rec- ords of the Spanish Inquisition and the trial of witches down to the primarily oral text of modern racism, the lynching of blacks, for instance, in the American South. Let us consider the accounts of medieval violence against Jews as they were recorded from the perspective of the Christian majority. We all know so well which thematic elements must be there and how they are organized that there is no need, really, to mention any specific examples. Let us briefly enumerate these elements: 1) Something is wrong with the community. Many people be- come ill and die mysteriously. The most sacred rules are trans- gressed; differences are erased; chaos reigns. 2) The Jews have the "evil eye." The Jews commit the most unnatural actions such as parricide, incest, etc. Hostile as they are to the true faith, the Jews must be responsible for whatever ails the community; a real plague, social agitation, etc. Rumor has it that some Jews have been seen tampering with the water supply. 3) Some Jews are killed or driven out. 4) Tranquility and order return to the community. We can easily see that these elements duplicate almost perfectly those in the mythical text. That is why the formulae of the structural analysis in Totemism will apply to them perfectly. We have a radical elimination of course and the eliminated fragment or fragments are guilty of a negatively qualified action. The elimination itself is positively qualified and it is collective rather than individual. We begin with undiffer- entiation and we end up with differentiation. The repre- sentations are the same in both categories of texts. No one would suggest, however, that the texts of mystified persecution should be read in the Levi-Straussian key of a topological mode; no one would suggest that these representations must be some kind of allegory for the virgin birth of "human thinking." The reason why we treat the two kinds of texts differently is that, in the case of mystified persecution, we immediately realize that we are dealing with real victims in a real episode of lynching. We understand that whenever lynching is reported from the perspec- tive of the lynchers themselves, the victims can and must befantasized without being unreal. The accusations against the Jews are no less fantastic than the nefarious properties attributed to mythological heroes. The two, in</page><page sequence="17">938 RENE GIRARD fact, are exactly the same: they include the evil eye, the plague, parricide, incest etc. The circumstances are the same, and the sequence of events is exactly the same. It is the same contradiction between the explicit message which singles out the victims as the only cause of the community's problems and the numerous indica- tions that suggest a sudden and brutal outburst of arbitrary violence. Even a superficial examination of the text will confirm what our common sense has already told us: the Jew's supernatural power for evil is imaginary, but it is not the fruit of an imagination purely gratuitous or determined solely by psychoanalytical drives. The delusion plays a social function and it is specific of that function. The evil powers of the Jews constitute permanent beliefs of the Christian community; these beliefs may remain dormant for a while in periods of relative social harmony but they will be quickly re-activated in times of crisis, when the problems of the community become unmanageable and even undefinable. Whenever the tensions become acute, the society will turn toward the Jews. We acknowledge the fact when we say that the Jews are the favorite scapegoats of Christian society. The word scapegoat is the English translation for the designation of the victim in the Old Testament ritual, the ritual described in XXIth chapter of Leviticus. In modern usage, this word has acquired a very special connotation which constitutes at least an implicit interpretation of the ritual itself. It refers to the process of really arbitrary victimage, un- perceived as such, which provides us with a key to the interpre- tation of the quasi-mythical texts I am now discussing, the texts of mystified persecution. We would not interpret these texts as we do, if we were not able to demystify them. And we demystify them when we realize they are structured on the scapegoat process itself: they reflect the delusion which inevitably accompanies that process. The best scapegoats, the only good scapegoats, really are the scapegoats who are not recognized as such. We cannot read the text of persecution correctly unless we become able to rehabilitate the victims, to realize that the accusations against them are groundless. It is very important to observe, at this point, that the desmystification of the quasi-mythical text, the text of mystified persecution, is inseparable from a certain ethical attitude. The only scientific reading of the text certainly coincides with the fulfillment of an ethical exigency. I do not claim that there are no objective differences between the text of medieval persecution and mythology proper. Differences</page><page sequence="18">M L N 939 are certainly there, but they may not be such as to preclude a similar referent and origin for the two types of text. This is really the gist of my hypothesis. Mythology is so similar in themes and structure to the texts of mystified persecution that it could also be rooted in a scapegoat process of which we would be the dupes like the believers themselves, a scapegoat process which we have not yet been able to decipher and encodify perhaps because it is culturally too distant from us, perhaps because it is better concealed, perhaps because of these two reasons combined, perhaps because of other reasons still, yet invisible to us. You can see now how useful it is to introduce into the debate those documents I call texts of mystified persecution, now demysti- fied by modern interpretation. These texts should make my hypothesis entirely clear. Their interpretation does not provide a metaphor or a model. It is the thing itself. What I really assert, in other words, is that the enigma of mythology can be solved and everything can become intelligible-even the divinization of the victim, almost completely absent from the texts of persecution-if we regard the process of mythical elaboration as a process similar, but not completely identical to the one we assume is really present behind such documents as the Christian account of a medieval pogrom, or accounts of their own lynching by lynching mobs them- selves, wherever they are and whoever their victims may be. Because the texts of mystified persecution have been demystified for a while now, because their interpretation has been settled once and for all along the lines which I propose to adopt in the case of mythology, these texts make my hypothesis very clear. They also have another advantage which cannot be spurned in the contem- porary climate of intellectual opinion. Even the most rabid expo- nents of a textuality detached from any reference and entirely closed upon itself will relent when confronted with the texts of persecution. They will not only confess that a referent is in order, but they will identify that referent if asked to do so; and it will be, if not exactly the same, at least analogous to the one I propose for mythology proper. The same people who will not even listen to my arguments when presented in a properly mythological context, will quite willingly surrender to them or rather they have already surrendered in the case of the quasimythical texts, the texts of mystified persecution. This fact reveals that the anti-referential dogma is as inconsistent</page><page sequence="19">940 RENE GIRARD really as it is vociferous, and it does not have to be taken too seriously. The only reason why this bizarre attitude can express itself with confidence comes from the exclusively mythical and literary context in which its exponents operate. They themselves, it appears, have not really considered the consequences of their own attitude. They do not think of what would happen if the dogma were seriously applied to all texts indiscriminately. The amazing thing is that these people can see themselves as "revolutionary"; even the most timid doubts regarding the legitimacy of their subjective nihilism is regarded as "reactionary." Let us see what would happen if the texts of mystified persecu- tion were treated in strict conformity with the dogma currently fashionable in our best intellectual circles. In the text of medieval antisemitism, many representations are clearly spurious and unbelievable. No historian worth his salt, however, will conclude from this fact that all representations are equally spurious and unbelievable, that it would be "naively empirical" to trust any of them. The truth is just the opposite. The representations that describe an episode of collective violence taking place at the height of a social crisis are made more rather than less trustworthy for being juxtaposed to the most fantastic accusations against the victims. If a historian well versed in structuralist and post-structuralist thought concluded that no real event, no extra-textual referent can be deduced from any repre- sentations, he would be considered either as an agent provocateur or as a fool, more probably still as both. Texts of mystified persecution are the primary source for the treatment of persecuted minorities. And no one would deny the certainty of these persecutions, even if it is of a very different nature from the mathematical certainty of the natural sciences. No one has yet suggested that this certainty must be another myth, the specific myth of a modern and humanistic era. What the current dogma really amounts to is really a blanket dismissal of all representations, or their blanket allegorization. This treatment seems poles apart from the blanket faith in all representations which characterizes religious faith, but it really is the closest thing to it, its modern equivalent, the greatest obstacle to a real penetration of the mythical text. What has prevented that penetration so far is precisely what religious faith and the current anti-referential skepticism have in</page><page sequence="20">M L N 941 common, the undifferentiated treatment of all representations. The same people who see very well the need not to treat all representations identically when they read a text of mystified persecution are blinded by their false radicalism to the possibility that a diversified treatment may also be needed in the case of mythology. We can see at what point exactly the valid method- ological principle gives way to the blind metaphysical faith. Between our two categories of text, the similarities are simply too striking for anyone to assert that the solution universally acknowl- edged for one category can be excluded out of hand for the other. Even if the parallel in the end turns out to be sterile, no one can say a priori that it must not be attempted, especially in view of the continued enigma presented by the mythical text. To assert a priori once more that this enigma will never be solved or that it does not really exist constitutes a surrender to the most oppressive dogma- ticism, perhaps to the one that wants to stifle not certain attitudes only, but the very spirit of research, the belief that significant re- sults can be achieved, that significant truths can be ascertained. This skeptical dogmaticism pretends to dominate the social sciences by legislating all their interesting questions out of existence. If we surveyed other texts of mystified persecution already acknowledged as such, we would find that most of them, if not all, come from the same historical world, ours. This fact is certainly related to our ability to demystify these texts. In each and every case, the victims of persecution are easily acknowledged because they bear some unmistakable sign of what we might call their "scapegoatability." These signs, of course, are just as arbitrary as any other signs; they are not transcultural; we are able to decipher them because they are signs of our society, because the code which provides the key to these signs is never really unfamiliar to us. In the case of mythology we know of no such clear cultural signs to help us understand the victims might be real. This can mean one of two things. Either the signs are present but we are unable to decipher them because we have not yet cracked the code, or the signs are really absent. The possibility that there are no cultural signs at all cannot be excluded. Most myth-producing societies are too small and too homogeneous to possess the religious or ethnic minorities which usually provide the large and heterogeneous "civilizations" with their reservoirs of scapegoat victims. We should not hurry to conclude, however, that the absence of cultural signs necessarily means the absence of all signs. Other</page><page sequence="21">942 RENE GIRARD signs of scapegoatability do exist. As a matter of fact, they are very easy to ascertain because they are really transcultural this time; everybody is aware of them and can verify for himself that they correspond to the constantly recurring feature of worldwide mythology. In order not to miss these signs, we must turn once more to the backward societies questioned earlier, the ones which are addicted to such things as the "evil eye," or to children in groups, perhaps to the type of communities children will form when they are left to their own devices in disintegrating societies. When there are no ethnic minorities, when there is no one in a community who can be defined as a "stranger," aggressive tensions tend to polarize those people who, for some reason or other, are still maladjusted to the ways of the community, notably the people who are physically crippled or deformed, or have some other kind of infirmity, like a speech impediment. When all the cultural signs are gone, in other words, or not yet available, very crude but highly visible physical signs tend to become the rallying point for the collective transference of anxiety and hostility. Tikarau walks with a limp. So do Oedipus, Hephaistos, the biblical Jacob, and countless others in the entire world. When the "evil eye" is not otherwise impaired, it may be a single eye and the missing eye is the equivalent of the limp. These facts have been observed long ago and no theory of mythology can dispense with their interpretation. The interpreta- tion of Levi-Strauss must be consistent, of course, with his interpretation of the mythical drama as a spatial allegory of the differentiation process: In all these instances, (the myths discussed in both Totemism and The Raw and the Cooked) a discrete system is produced by the destruc- tion of certain elements or their removal from the original whole. In all these cases, too, the originator of the reduction is himself in a sense reduced: the six Ojibwa gods were blind from choice and exiled their companion who had been guilty of removing the band- age over his eyes. Tikarau, the thieving Tikopia god, pretended to limp in order to be better able to get possession of the banquet. Akaruoio Bodokori also limped. Mythological figures who are blind or lame, one-eyed or one-armed, are familiar the world over; and we find them disturbing, because we believe their condition to be one of deficiency. But just as a system that has been made discrete through the removal of certain elements becomes logically richer, although numerically poorer, so myths often confer a positive signif- icance on the disabled and the sick, who embody modes of media-</page><page sequence="22">M L N 943 tion. We imagine infirmity and sickness to be deprivations of being and therefore evil. However,..." negativized being" is entitled to occupy a whole place within the system, since it is the only con- ceivable means of transition between two "full" states.9 Very much in the style of our literary criticism, Levi-Strauss reads the crippled victim as a mise en abyme of his topological allegory. The only difficulty with this ingenious interpretation is that the theme of the organ in excess or enlarged-the hunchback, for instance-is almost as frequent as the theme of the organ miss- ing or shrunken. When lameness itself is defined as a "swollen foot," it must belong to the first type of disablement rather than the second. The Freudians, of course, can deal with both sides of the coin. Wherever castration will not do, the good old phallic symbol will and vice versa. Psychoanalysis is no more satisfactory than structur- alism, however, because its theory of symbolization demands that the object symbolized be out of sight. We may still believe that such is the case with Pulcinello; in many myths, however, the object is simply too much in evidence to be comfortably defined as repressed. In many North American trickster myths, for instance, the object is so inordinately long and cumbersome that its possessor must carry it wrapped around his neck or shoulders, like a fireman does his hoses, until he can dispose of it more permanently by having it cut off; an operation that seems deplorably explicit from the standpoint of a castration complex. Contemporary Freudians are too wise, of course, to be put off by my objections. They have whole arsenals of distinctions specifically designed to counter them. At this point, for instance, they would probably reproach me for ignoring the formidable difference, the gaping abyss Jacques Lacan has discovered between the symbolic phallus and the human penis.... The last phase of great theories which have almost exhausted their creative power is usually marked by the proliferation of subtle and ultimately sterile readjustments. It is a phase of preiciosite, really, immediately followed by the absolute skepticism which is now gaining all around us. To those raised in such a climate, the truly revolutionary intuitions which are about to take over appear too direct and simple to be of any value. 9 Claude Levi-Strauss, The Raw and the Cooked, p. 53.</page><page sequence="23">944 RENE GIRARD The search for interpretations more and more refined can only mislead us, blunt our sensitivity to the crude forms of victimage which are really at work behind mythology. If we could learn common sense, once more, without forgetting what we know, we would realize that the infirmities and disabilities of so many myth- ical heroes can only designate them to the crowd as potential victims; they are signs even less ambiguous really, than the sign of "scapegoatability" in the texts we can already acknowledge as texts of mystified persecution, membership in an ethnic or reli- gious minority.10 In the page just quoted, the desire of Levi-Strauss to read the radical elimination of the crippled hero as a purely logical game brings him very close to the truth, too close for comfort, perhaps, judging from his curious recommendation to the reader that he should not find any of this "disturbing." Is mythology the still misunderstood record of countless Cains killing countless Abels? Can cultural differentiation be founded on murder? Can it be the same thing as the mark of Cain? The conse- quences of a positive answer would be "disturbing" indeed. We prefer to believe the question is not genuine. It must not be asked in good faith. It is obviously not "scientific" but "impressionistic," and even "mystical." There must be a vast ideological plot behind it, a "reactionary" plot, bien entendu. How could a question be ''scientific" and "disturbing" at the same time? In such a climate of opinion, it is interesting to show that even and especially the analyses of Levi-Strauss, when they are sub- mitted to the slightest scrutiny, immediately produce the problem- atic which seems most alien to them and compels us once more to ask the question that is most inimical: can we always avoid facing that disturbing question? The Johns Hopkins University 10 Another and even more essential difference between mythology and the texts already acknowledged by us as texts of persecution is the sacralization of the victim, of course, always present in the former, almost completely absent in the latter. In order to prove my point, I must show that the scapegoat process, in certain conditions, can also generate all sacred representations. This analysis is not possible within the limits of the present essay.
