<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NATURE OF DAEMONS: A THEOLOGICAL APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF GEOMETRICAL PROPORTION IN CALCIDIUS' COMMENTARY TO PLATO'S TIMAEUS (40D-41A) ANNA SOMFAI Calcidius' Middle Platonic Commentary , written during the second half of the fourth century AD, is the only extant ancient Latin exposition of Plato's Timaeus} It accompanies Calcidius' Latin rendering of Timaeus 17a-53c.2 The translation includes the introductory conversation and the mythological stories, left almost entirely uncommented by Calcidius, and the narrative of the creation and the structure of the cosmic and human body and soul. Calcidius' exegesis of Timaeus 40d-41a, a passage that has traditionally attracted comments on Plato's approach to the mythological genealogies and on the use of irony, centres on an exposition of the nature and function of daemons. Calcidius used Plato's mention of ãXXox ôocí|uoveç, 'other daemons' - the reference to the anthropomorphic divinities - for exploring the cosmological and theological place of daemons. The passages on daemons have been considered by modern scholars a separate treatise3 and were consequently studied as an isolated section and a specimen of Late Antique daemonology.4 I argue that far from being an isolated treatise, the section on daemons is an inherent part of the Commentary and it reveals Calcidius' methodological and conceptual approach. Calcidius' exposition on daemons presents a puzzle. Why did he, ignoring the content and immediate context of the brief mythological reference by Plato, inquire into the nature of daemons, and did so in great detail and at considerable length? I propose to answer this question by looking at Calcidius' exposition against the background of the Commentary' s general concept that, I suggest, is itself original and unique and that has not been noticed in modern scholarship. 1 Timaeus a Calcidio translates commentarioque instruētus , ed.

Den Boeft in his introduction and notes to his English translation of the section on daemons provided useful notes on some particular issues of daemonology, but limited his discussion to Calcidius' possible sources and to a comparison with some other texts on daemons. Ancient approaches to Plato's 'Timaeus' 129</page><page sequence="2">1 30 ANCIENT APPROACHES TO PLATO' S TIMAEUS 1. The Commentary 5 Calcidius considered the Timaeus ' reputation as a difficult read the result of the inappropriate approach of the ancients, and proposed a proper method of investigation. Each problem that arises in a text has to be studied through the discipline it belongs to: wounds have to be dealt with by medicine, the motion of the stars through astronomy. The problems related to the text of the Timaeus concern the sensible world and hence they have to be studied through arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.6 The mathematical sciences then provide the path through which the mind ascends to the realm of higher contemplation.7 Calcidius divided the translated portion of the Timaeus into two parts, 17a-39e and 39e-53c respectively, and followed the same division in his Commentary .8 The division, I suggest, corresponds to Calcidius' hermeneutic project. In the first part of the Commentary he explored the mathematical concepts used by Plato in his creation narrative.9 In accordance with his prefatory remarks on method, he proceeded within the framework of the four mathematical sciences, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. The strong mathematical character is underlined by his use of twenty-five diagrams, some of which are Calcidius' own inventions while others were borrowed from Greek mathematical sources. The lettered diagrams are described in detail following the Greek diagram tradition and serve as mathematical proofs and as tool for thought experiments. Calcidius used the diagrams for visualising complex concepts, such as the nature of the geometrical mean (arithmetical, geometrical, and musical diagrams) or the creation of the world soul and the concepts of astronomy (astronomical diagrams). Calcidius studied in particular the nature of the continuous geometrical proportion, the main principle of the orderly universe, chosen by the Demiurge as the best bond that assures the harmonious connection between the elements, the building blocks of the cosmic body. Fire is needed for visibility, earth for solidity and since in the case of three-dimensional bodies, such as the universe, two means are necessary, the Demiurge inserted air and water as means to join 5 The internal evidence of the place and date of composition and of Calcidius' Christianity provided by the Commentary is inconclusive and there is no independent external evidence concerning any detail of his life. The content, sources, and linguistic characteristics of the Commentary and the translation suggest a fourth-century origin. The date is supported by the introductory letter to the translation addressed to a certain Osius who was, from the eleventh century, identified with the bishop of Cordova, active in the middle of the fourth century. Calcidius was believed to have been his archdeacon and thus was given a Christian identity. Another Osius is known to have been an imperial officer in Italy at the end of the fourth century and the link could possibly suggest a pagan background for Calcidius with a slightly later date, still within the possibilities of the philosophical and philological evidence of the text. 6 Comment. 1-3; 57,1-58,17. 7 Comment. 355; 346,3-10. 8 In the prefatory letter to the translation Calcidius remarked that he would continue his work if his present achievement were to meet a favourable reception by his addressee. If he had ever carried on with his work, it disappeared without any trace. 9 The emphasis on the role of mathematics was a feature of the second-century Greek Timaeus commentators, Theon of Smyrna and Nicomachus of Gerasa, who served as Calcidius' main source. They produced mathematical textbooks by giving an introduction to elementary mathematics that was needed for the mastering of the concepts present in the Timaeus. See Theonis Smyrnei philosophi platonici Expositio rerum mathematicarum ad legendum Platonem utilium, ed. E. Hiller (Leipzig 1878) and Nicomachi Geraseni pythagorei Introductionis arithmeticae libri //, ed. R. Hoche (Leipzig 1866). Adhering to the dialogue's narrative, however, Calcidius addressed philosophical puzzles and did not include any discussion of basic mathematics, such as the definitions of the point or line.</page><page sequence="3">ANNA SOMFAI: THE NATURE OF DAEMONS 1 3 1 the two extreme elements. The chain created this way corresponds to the chain of numbers in continuous proportion, such as 2:4=4:8 etc. Calcidius also introduced within the chain of neighbouring elements the system of shared properties, such as acutus - obtunsus , subtilis - corpulentus , mobilis - immobilis. Each element shares two of its three properties with each of its neighbour progressing from earth through water and air to fire and backwards. The second part of the Commentary deals with the structure of the created universe and the forces that work therein. Calcidius examined the nature and function of each created being explaining their place in the universe and their relation to one another. He examined the definitions and relation of fate, necessity, providence, and matter. There is very little reference in the second part of the Commentary to mathematics, however, hence Calcidius' opening announcement that the mathematical sciences are of primary importance in the understanding of the Timaeus becomes a puzzling one. In what way and where in the second part of the Commentary does the concept of mathematics fulfil its crucial role? I suggest that Calcidius experimented with the scope of the mathematical notion of àvaXoyía that he considered the key concept of the Timaeus and made it the hermeneutic axis of his own Commentary. His study of the nature and cosmological place of daemons served as a paradigmatic case study through which he applied in a non-mathematical context the concept and terminology of the continuous geometrical proportion. In the idea of applying the concept of the geometrical mean outside the realm of mathematics Calcidius followed Plato10 and Aristotle.11 Drawing on the Timaeus as well as on some of the other dialogues, Calcidius developed Plato's cosmos beyond its original details. 2. The sources Calcidius' account of daemons relies for many of its components on Plato's dialogues.12 Daemons were in Pre-Socratic philosophy and literature believed to be mediators between the immortal gods and mortal human beings, sometimes equated with souls or gods. Plato in the Symposium considered Love to be a daemon13 and described daemons as messengers and interpreters who deliver men's prayers and offerings to the gods and convey the divine instructions in return.14 They fill in the space between men and gods causing the universe to be an interrelated whole.15 In the Statesman Plato attributed a caring function to the 10 See e. g. Tim. 29c, 32a-32b, also Rep. 6 508c, 509d-510b, 5 lie, 7 534a, 9 576c. 11 See esp. Nic. Eth. 5.3. 12 Calcidius left the word 'òaipcov' in its transliterated Latin form {daemon) preserving the connotations attached to daemons in the Greek tradition. In his rendering of the Timaeus Cicero, recoursing to the Roman liturgical context, translated 'ôaí|iOveç' with lares who were the good spirits of the dead and provided men, in exchange for their worship, with guidance. The fact that Cicero expressed his uncertainty as to whether or not he had found the suitable Latin equivalent indicates the problematic nature of the interpretation. 'Reliquorum autem, quos Graeci ôai'iuovaç appellant, nostri opinor Lares, si modo hoc recte conversum videri potest, et nosse et nuntiare ortum eorum maius est quam ut profiteri nos scire audeamus', TimCic. 11; 212,9-12. 13 Symp. 202d. 14 Symp. 202e-203a. 15 For a reference to this passage see Comment. 127; 170,13-14. Plato introduced this characterization of daemons as means by a passage on true belief. True belief is the middle between knowledge and ignorance just as Love holds a middle position between extremes such as being attractive or repulsive, good or bad, mortal or immortal.</page><page sequence="4">1 32 ANCIENT APPROACHES TO PLATO' S TIMAEUS daemons16 and in the Laws and the Republic they are often mentioned alongside the mythological gods and appear as guiding and protecting forces to be revered by man.17 In the Timaeus , in the passage that prompted Calcidius' account, Plato made only a passing reference to daemons, with the meaning of 'mythological gods'.18 In the second half of the dialogue, not translated and commented on by Calcidius, Plato equated the highest kind of human soul with a man's daemon.19 Apart from Plato's genuine dialogues the only source for Calcidius' section on daemons that can be identified with certainty is the Epinomis. The Epinomis, a work attributed by modern scholars to Philip of Opus, connects daemons to the five elements - ether, fire, air, water, and earth - as their abode20 and has been transmitted as an appendix to Plato's Laws. By 200 BC it was considered by the Alexandrian scholars to be an authentic work of Plato and was referred to as such by Theon of Smyrna21 and Nicomachus of Gerasa.22 In the section on daemons Calcidius made use of the Epinomis under the title ' Liber philosophus '23 and significantly, he regarded his source as a genuine work of Plato. He used it to clarify and expand on various points of the Timaeus , similarly to his use of the other dialogues, especially the Symposium and the Republic , and assumed that he did so on Plato's authority. Waszink and den Boeft acknowledged that the Epinomis is quoted and referred to by Calcidius when he discussed the parallel between the five elements and the five created beings, and the character of the daemons.24 1 suggest, however, that beyond the clear allusions to the text, it may have provided an inspiration for Calcidius in a more general sense in his interpretation of the place of the quadrivium in the study of philosophy. According to the author of the Epinomis , arithmetic and geometry are to be studied both for their own sake and as a basis for the astronomical theology that involves the contemplation of the soul and of the 16 Polit. 272e. 17 Laws 4 713d, 5 738b, 740b, 7 801e, 8 848d, 9 877a; Rep. 4 427b, 10 619c. 18 Tim. 40d-41a. 19 Tim. 90a. After the time of Plato daemons in Greek philosophy gradually acquired a negative image. They were believed to be subject to human emotions, some of them were assumed to be evil (Xenocrates) and their immortality was doubted (Plutarch). Xenocrates drew a parallel between the hierarchy of geometrical shapes and that of different entities. God's nature is paralleled by an equilateral triangle, man's by a scalene, and the daemons appear in the middle in the form of isosceles. This theory fits very well Calcidius' approach but he interrupted his commentary before the section in which Plato introduced the regular solids and their rendering to the elements. The Middle Platonic preoccupation with harmony and world order brought back the more positive image. Daemons were once more needed as a mean to ensure universal harmony. In order for them to function as such, they needed to share in both divine and human natures: they were immortal but subject to human passions. This new context changed the attitude toward daemons' being subject to passion and the characteristic lost its negative connotation. Instead, it became the positive means for the daemons' principal function: linking the world of immortals with that of mortals. Apuleius divided daemons into two kinds, one more divine, another more human. This approach was followed by Plotinus and Porphyry and was taken up by Christian theologians as well. Calcidius' Commentary belongs to this tradition. 20 Albinus took a similar approach in his Epitome and distinguished between visible and invisible daemons. 21 Theonis Smyrnei philosophi platonici Expo sitio, above n.9. 22 Nicomachi Geraseni pythagorei Introductions arithmeticae libri //, above n.9. 23 Comment. 133; 174,19. • 24 See the apparatus criticus of Waszink's edition, above n.l, and den Boeft, Demons, above n.4, passim.</page><page sequence="5">ANNA SOMFAI: THE NATURE OF DAEMONS 1 33 divine beings.25 Mathematics, including the use of diagrams, serves as a foundation for speculation of a higher kind, a theme that became the leitmotif in Calcidius' Commentary . 3. Plato's daemons and daemons in the Commentary There are two comments concerning the nature of daemons that Calcidius attributed to Plato and impressed upon us without delay as he embarked on the second part of his Commentary. Firstly, daemons were created in order to fill in the internal part of the universe, the middle space between the two beings that exist in the spatial extreme positions, as there must be no empty space left in the region populated by rational beings.26 Secondly, it is beyond us to speak about the nature of daemons with the authority of knowledge, hence we have to have recourse to belief and accept the stories our ancestors left for us.27 The first of these statements relies not on the Timaeus but on the Epinomis and the Symposium. Calcidius outlined the range of created beings structured in a spatial hierarchy and their nature established through sets of properties. The highest place in the hierarchy is filled in by the stars and planets defined as the visible and immortal gods.28 They have a fiery nature and their abode is the sky. Men and animals inhabit the earth and have a terrestrial nature.29 Between these two visible entities are the invisible gods of angelic nature whom Plato calls daemons.30 Daemons, equated by Calcidius with angels, consist of three groups.31 The first, purest group lives in the ether, the second inhabits the air, and the third's dwelling place is a region called humecta essentia , humid essence, defined by Calcidius as the denser air to be breathed by man.32 His daemons are thus not mere spiritual mediators but they also hold a spatial middle position within the three-dimensional cosmic topography. Calcidius, both in his translation (second column below) and in the lemma he used in his Commentary for his exegesis (third column below), departed from Plato's text in two significant points. Firstly, he left out the reference to the 'origin' of gods and shifted the emphasis to their nature.33 Secondly, by replacing the reference to 'other daemons' with a reference to 'daemons', Calcidius narrowed down the allusion to a single, defined group of divine entities, called daemons, and stripped the sentence of its mythological connotation. 25 Epinomis 991e-992ain Plato: Charmides, Alcibíades /, II, Hipparchus, The Lovers, Theages, Minos, Epinomis , trans.

Planets, the instruments in the creation of time, move in a 'consonant', musically harmonious way, associating the musical and astronomical passages in the first part of the Commentary. (Comment. 124; 167,10-1 1.) Earth assumes an anthropomorphic nature as the custos , guardian, of day and night, already pointing to the function of care and supervision that Calcidius attributed in the subsequent passages to daemons. 29 Comment. 119; 164,4-18. 30 Comment. 119; 164,19-165,1, s eeSymp. 202e. 31 For the three-fold division of daemons see Epinomis 981c. 32 Comment. 120; 165,2-4. 33 Calcidius considered Plato's reference to the divinities as a mere consequence of his wish not to leave the work of creation unfinished, and attributed the lack of persuasion and the role of belief in Plato's words to the insignificance of the matter.</page><page sequence="6">1 34 ANCIENT APPROACHES TO PLATO' S TIMAEUS Tucpi ôè TÔ)v aÀÀcov At vero invisibilium At vero naturae ôai|uóvG)v eÍ7teív koci divinarum potestatum quae daemonum prestare yvôvai TTļv yéveoiv daemones nuncupantur rationem maius esse jueîÇov Kaô' r|jj.ćcę.34 praestare rationem maius est opus dicit quam ferre opus quam ferre valeat valeat hominis hominis ingenium.35 ingenium.36 In his translation Calcidius replaced the word 'daemons' with a definition: 'invisible divine powers'.37 Vision occupies a central place in the Timaeus as it is through seeing and observing the visible universe, first of all the movement of the celestial bodies, that man can attain knowledge. The fundamental difference between daemons and the rest of the created universe lies in their invisibility. Visibility belongs to the realm of sense perception, the mundus sensilis , and hence invisibility does not fit in with the nature of the cosmos. Calcidius concluded that daemons present a puzzle as the study of their nature goes beyond the realm of physics38 and such matters have to be grasped by man through epoptica .39 The expression epoptica does not occur in other Latin sources and it was possibly Calcidius' idea to use the transliterated Greek word. Its Greek etymology connects the expression with the meaning 'insight' and denotes the initiation into mysteries. Plato used the term in this sense in the Phaedrus where it appears within the context of the soul's recollection of ideas.40 Epoptica refers to the 'mind's eye' as opposed to physical vision to fit knowledge rather than opinion (ôó^oc), the result of sense perception. The reference, though clearly meant to be applicable to daemons, may have been intended to refer to the approach of the entire second part of the Commentary. The causes within the realm of nature, in which the visible phenomena are observed through sense perception, have been studied in the first part of the Commentary with the aid of mathematics. The questions beyond nature, that is those related to metaphysics, are to be addressed now in the second part. Epoptica being the kind of contemplation that is beyond physica , Calcidius remarked, does not suit the issue that seems to be in hand in the Timaeus , that is, the investigation of nature.41 The nature of daemons, however, going beyond physica , can be properly explored by means of epoptica. 42 34 Tim. 40d. 'It is beyond us to speak or to know about the origin of the other daemons.' 35 TimCalc. 34,13-14. 'It is too great a task for man's talents to give an account of the invisible divine powers, called daemons.' 36 Comment. 127; 170,6-7. 'It is too great a task for man's talents to give an account of the nature of daemons.' 37 The definition takes its terminology from the passage that directly follows the mention of daemons in the Timaeus : the Demiurge's address to the gods. 38 'quod sit elatior et ultra naturae contemplationem', Comment. 120; 165,4-5. 39 'epoptica, altior aliquanto quam physica', Comment . 127; 170,6. 40 Plato, Phaedrus 250c (Plato also refers to daemons there). 41 '... inquisitio istius rei primariae supervectaeque contemplationis sit, quae appellator epoptica, altior aliquanto quam physica, proptereaque nobis, qui de rerum natura nunc disputamus, nequaquam conveniens esse videatur.' Comment. 127; 170,9-12. 42 Calcidius used the expression once more in the Commentary, again to contrast it with natural philosophy and pointing out its superiority. '... haec quippe naturalis, illa epoptica disputatio est, naturalis quidem, ut imago nutans aliquatenus et in veri simili quadam stabilitate contenta, epoptica vero, quae ex sincerissimae rerum scientiae fonte manat.' Comment. 272; 277,5-8.</page><page sequence="7">ANNA SOMFAI: THE NATURE OF DAEMONS 1 35 A new puzzle arises. What is epoptica in practice? After having established the difference in approach, Calcidius proceeded with his study of the nature of daemons and one has to assume that he followed his own guidance and did so through epoptica. The method that emerges is one that goes back to the quadrivial exagoge of the first part of the Commentary : the use of the mathematical concept of àvaÀoyía. 4. Daemons as a cosmological and theological mean Calcidius announced that he would provide the 'real account' of the nature of daemons after having presented Plato's view, thereby allowing himself a fresh start.43 He began by discussing the elements as pertaining to the five regions of the universe and hence contextualizing the place of daemons within the cosmological scheme. The outer region, the highest and largest, is that of fire, while the lowest and smallest is taken up by earth. Between the two are the three middle regions: ether (defined as a denser kind of fire), air, and humecta essentia or hygra usia (defined as a denser form of air). Calcidius' direct source for the incorporation of the fifth element, quinta essentia or ether, was probably the Epinomis.44 It postulates the existence of two visible kinds of being, one immortal and fiery (the stars) and the other mortal and earthly (man), and between them are located the three invisible kinds of being.45 Calcidius assumed that the cosmic regions are composed of specific elements and they form a mathematical sequence in which the middle regions connect the extreme ones according to continuous proportion, iuxta rationem continui competentis.46 It is not only the concept of continuous geometrical proportion, but also the strict mathematical terminology that provide a conceptual link with the mathematics of the first part of the Commentary : Utitur ergo nunc ratione ac remedio continui competentis propterea quod natura eius coniugabilis est et adunatrix distantium limitům similisque eius rationis, qua deus mundi sensilis fabricator usus est, cum extimis mundi limitibus, igni atque terrae, aeris et aquae insereret medietatem.47 43 'Haec ad praesens Plato quidem de daemonum genere disseruit, nos tarnen oportet, etsi non usque quaque, veram eorum breviter explicare rationem, quae est huius modi.' Comment. 128; 171,19-21. 44 The bodies, then, being five (tīčvtc ou v oûogjv tcùv 0(0|icîtg)v), we must name them as fire, water, and thirdly air, earth fourth, and ether fifth; and by predominance of these are each of the many varieties of creatures perfected.' Epinomis 981c. 45 'Well then, for the present let us attempt so much in treating of the gods, as to try - after observing the two living creatures visible to us (xà ôúo KairiôóvTeç £â&gt;a ópaxá), of which we call one immortal, and the other, all earthly, a mortal creation - to tell of the three middle things of the five (ià xpía là |iéoa i&lt;bv Ttevxe), which come most evidently, according to the probable opinion (icaià òó£av), between those two.' Epinomis 984b. 46 Comment. 129; 172,10-11. 47 Comment. 27; 68,18-22. 'Atque ita inter ignem et terram aer et aqua de extimoram concretione nascentur, ex quibus constat mundi continuado. Conservatur autem hoc pacto analogia quoque geometrica iuxta rationem continui competentis; ut enim ignis adversum aera, sic aer adversum aquam et demum aqua iuxta terram, retrorsumque ut terra adversum aquam, sic aqua adversum aera et aer adversus ignem.' ( Comment . 22; 72,28-73,4.)</page><page sequence="8">1 36 ANCIENT APPROACHES TO PLATO' S TIMAEUS In connection with daemons the proportion re-appears on the macro-scale of entire regions of the cosmic infrastructure.48 The continuous geometrical proportion is applied to the inhabited spheres of the universe, each sphere corresponding to a different level of the hierarchy of mortal and immortal created beings. By linking the different levels of elemental hierarchy to the different levels of celestial hierarchy, Calcidius drew a parallel between the natural philosophical and the theological systems. While in the Epinomis the discussion of elements and middle beings lacked context, Calcidius placed it within the cosmological system of the Timaeus. He built a parallel structure where elements and created beings were part of a scheme where extremes are joined through means. Both the concept and the terminology in the portrayal of daemons as a mean are an indication of Calcidius' deliberate application of the geometrical mean (and more generally the laws of mathematics) to an instance of theological enquiry. In the first part of the Commentary Calcidius described in great detail the joining of the elements through the continuous proportion and by means of the properties the neighbouring elements share.49 He now replaced the elements and their properties with the appropriate subjects and properties of the new context: created beings instead of the elements and mortalis - immortalis and patibilis - impatibilis as the properties instead of acutus - obtunsus , subtilis - corpulentos, mobilis - immobilis. Quare cum sit divinum quidem et immortale genus animalium caeleste sidereum, temporarium vero et occiduum passionique obnoxium terrenum, necesse est esse inter haec duo medietatem aliquam conectentem extimos limites, sicut in harmonia videmus et in ipso mundo. Ut enim sunt in ipsis materiis medietates, quae interpositae totius mundi corpus continuant iugiter, suntque inter ignem et terram duae medietates aeris et aquae, quae mediae tangunt conectuntque extimos limites, sic, cum sit immortale animal et impatibile idemque rationabile, quod caeleste dicitur, existente item alio mortali passionibusque obnoxio, genere nostro, necesse est aliquod genus medium fore, quod tam caelestis quam terrenae naturae sit particeps, idque et immortale esse et obnoxium passioni. Talis porro natura daemonum est, opinor, habens cum divinitate consortium propter immortalitatem, habens etiam cum occiduis cognationem, quia est patibile nec immune a passionibus, cuius affectus bonis quoque consulit.50 Following here the model he created for the description of the elements in the first part of the Commentary , Calcidius presents the properties of the two extreme beings and joins them 48 For Plato's concept of regions coming into existence as a result of motion see Tim. 53a. 49 Comment . 20-22; 71,10-73,4. 50 'As there is a divine and immortal genus of the heavenly stars and a temporal and perishing, earthly one that is bound by passions, it is necessary that there is a mean between these two, that connects the outermost limits, just as we see in the harmony and in the world itself. Since in the matters themselves there are means that, having been inserted, link the body of the whole world in a constant bond, and between fire and earth are the means of air and water, which middles touch and connect the outermost limits, similarly, while there is an immortal being, not bound by passion and in the meantime rational, that we call celestial, there also exists another one, a mortal, bound by passions, our genus, it is necessary that there is another, middle genus, that participates in the celestial nature as well as in the earthly one, which is both immortal and bound by passion. Such is the nature of daemons, I think, sharing with the divine because of its immortality, and sharing with the perishing since it is passible and is not immune to passions, whose goodness takes care of the good ones.' Comment. 131; 173,7-20.</page><page sequence="9">ANNA SOMFAI: THE NATURE OF DAEMONS 1 37 through a middle being that shares in the properties of both extremes. To allow for an even closer parallel Calcidius returned to the four elements that he used in the first part of the Commentary and left ether out of his account. The two extreme elements, fire and earth, are linked in the cosmic body through the two middle elements, air and water. Between the divine, immortal, impassible, rational stars and the mortal and passible men there must be, similarly to the cosmic body, a mean that participates in both the celestial and the terrestrial natures: daemons are immortal and subject to passions. They are located in the macro-regions of air and the watery substance, humecta essentia. The terminology - medietas , extimi limites , harmonia , totius mundi corpus - suggests a dependence on the mathematical description of the cosmos in the first part of the Commentary. The parallel between the middle elements, on the one hand, and daemons, on the other, is emphasized by the structure of the comparative sentence: 'Ut enim sunt in ipsis materiis medietates ... sic ... necesse est aliquod genus medium fore, quod tam caelestis quam terrenae naturae sit particeps.' 5. The nature of daemons and angels: means inside the mean Once having established the cosmic position of daemons, Calcidius, in order to inquire into their nature and function, further experimented with the application of the concept of extremes and means. He was oddly wavering between altogether equating angels and daemons or considering them as not quite the same creatures. He set up two systems. Firstly, drawing on the model of daemons being the mean between the stars and mankind, he introduced a new theological approach to accommodate and describe the nature and position of angels. Secondly, in order to look into the nature of what it is to be a mean, he studied the three kinds of daemon. Calcidius' description of angels runs through both parallel systems. They are the sole mean component of the theological system. In the second system there are three groups of daemon inhabiting the three middle regions of the universe51 and one of these, we are told now, the ethereal one, the Hebrews call holy angels ( sancii angeli).52 Angels or daemons were given to humans by god in order to guide them, Calcidius said, and the etymology of the words reflects their function. They are called by the Greeks daemons because they know everything,53 and angels, because they are messengers who ceaselessly carry communications between god and man.54 The existence of bad as well as good daemons should not frighten anyone, for the same dichotomy also applies to angels.55 Are they the same then? In his discussion of angels Calcidius returned to the terminology he used in the first part of the Commentary in the descriptions of the geometrical diagrams. The sentence structure of the mathematical description serves as the paradigm for setting up his definition of the position of angels: 'ut enim deus iuxta angelům, sic angelus iuxta hominem' ('as god to 51 Comment. 120; 165,2-3. 52 Comment. 132; 173,22. 53 Comment. 132; 174,2. 54 Comment. 132; 174,4-6. 55 Comment. 133; 174,14-17.</page><page sequence="10">1 38 ANCIENT APPROACHES TO PLATO' S TIMAEUS angels, angels to man').56 For instance, in the description of the second diagram, in which the geometrical mean is presented by the proof of squares, Calcidius said: Further where the angles are equal, the sides will be in proportion; for as the side Br is to the side TZ, so is the side Ar to the side TU. I say that a rational mean is found between these similar parallelograms.57 Similarly, in the explanation of the two kinds of proportion, the continuous and disjunct, Calcidius described the relation of numbers with the same terminology: ... and a continuous proportion is found in three terms, as a minimum: as the first is to the second, so the second is to the third, that is, as eight is to four, so four is to two; ... 58 The appearance of god and angels instead of celestial bodies and daemons recasts the ávodoyía within a Biblical setting. In that respect the section on daemons is unique within the Commentary whose basic tone avoids Christianity and Calcidius here probably reckoned with Christian readership. Angels are the highest kind of daemon and their character is closely related to the portrait of daemons found in the Epinomis : they possess an excellent memory and intelligence, and use their wisdom to aid mankind.59 The description of the good daemons is based again on the Epinomis with a reference to it as a work of Plato.60 The mention of Plato allows the readers to shift their frame of mind back to the context of the Timaeus. Among both daemons and angels there are sancii and 'the opposite'.61 Calcidius seems to have deliberately avoided the use of malus or any of its synonyms, instead he added that the Greeks called these daemons polluti et infecti.62 This medical vocabulary conjures up the image of illness and reflects the rhetoric of deprivation, implying a diversion from an originally good state. What these daemons are deprived of are the properties of the good daemons: admirable wisdom, memory, omniscience, and the delight in good men and hatred toward the wicked ones.63 The emphasis in the portrait of daemons or angels on memory and knowledge resonates with Plato's theory of knowledge. Knowledge for humans is remembering what the soul has already known in its previous existence. These qualities thus establish a link between the nature of daemons and that of human souls. Daemons are obedient to celestial power as well as concerned for terrestrial beings64 and are characterized in their function as mediators. Calcidius attributed invisibility to the 56 Comment. 132; 174,4. 57 'Porro ubi aequales anguli, latera pro competenti erunt; ut enim est B Y latus iuxta TZ latus, ita A T latus iuxta TH latus.

The explanation Calcidius gave for invisibility was inspired by Plato's discussion of the elements: everything needs fire and earth for visibility and tangibility.66 Calcidius now argued that daemons, having too little fire in their bodies to make them perspicuous and too little earth to make them solid, are invisible. Their entire structure (compago) consists of aetheris serenitate et aeris liquore.61 One cannot help but associate liquor with the more watery kind of air, the humecta essentia , which despite its watery nature is a type of air.68 Air is the only entirely invisible one among the elements and it corresponds to the one created being that itself is invisible: the daemon. The aerial nature of daemons thus underlines their invisibility. The choice of the word compago , an expression specifically used for ships seems strange in connection with ethereal beings. It conveys Calcidius' concern with the body of the daemons.69 Possessing a body that lacks fire and earth and hence is invisible and untouchable70 likens daemons to souls. In the first part of the Commentary Calcidius described the universal soul as an incorporeal 'body', whose structural 'bodiness' enables it to fit into the three-dimensional body of the universe.71 He linked there the visible harmony of geometry with the visible body of the universe, and the invisible musical harmony with the invisible soul. Through the squaring of numbers they both become mathematical bodies, yet the difference of visibility and invisibility remains in place. Now the elements, ether and air, of which the material component of daemons is formed, are made into an indissoluble surface ( indissolubilem coagmentavit superficiem).12 Surfaces in geometry are the planes out of which solids are made. Calcidius' emphasis on surfaces also points to the potential for the bodily nature of daemons.73 Ethereal daemons differ from the aerial daemons only in degree, the latter being closer to earth: they are rational, immortal, sensible beings who look after man.74 They inhabit the ether while the aerial ones inhabit the air, and, being closer to earth, the latter are more prone to emotions than the former. The explanation of these qualities, however brief, contains a new element: daemons, we are told, are souls and their being animae hinges on their use of bodies.75 The explanation for the immortality of daemons is that they do not change their bodies. This body, which daemons never cease using, is not described in detail but rather is left by Calcidius in its invisible state. Since the soul is described as consisting of the elements we 65 Comment . 134; 175,4-7. 66 Tim. 31b. 67 Comment. 134; 175,8-11. 68 Comment. 120; 165,2-4. 69 Compago is not used randomly; as is often the case in Calcidius' text, a word prefigures the concept expounded in the next paragraph. 70 Comment . 134; 175,8-9. 71 See Comment. 92; 144,12-145,9 on the creation of the soul and its relation to the elements and body. 12 Comment. 134; 175,10-11. 73 Calcidius briefly mentioned the opinion that this entire middle region inhabited by the daemons might be Hades (Comment. 134; 175,1 1-12) and referred to Hesiod in connection with the number of daemons, which he had reckoned to be three times ten thousand ( Comment . 134; 175,12-14). 74 'animal rationabile immortale patibile aethereum diligentiam hominibus impertiens.'

But it is unclear whether elements should be taken on the micro-level, being combined into a mixture from which the bodies are built, or on the macro-level as each region consisting of one single element. The five-element macro-model is unique to this section of the Commentary. Stars inhabit the region of fire and men live in the zone of earth; daemons fill the three elements between these extremes. Within the three middle elements yet another triad of extremes and mean emerges. The aerial daemons represent a mean between the ethereal and humid ones, since they are between the extremes of the most divine and most human daemons. Thus the transition between the divine and human is further softened by the introduction of yet one more mean. Daemons of the third, lowest kind are the closest to earth; hence they are more under the influence of human-like passions than those on the two other levels. They are not always invisible and may assume different shapes.76 This lowest kind of daemon, barely retaining daemon-like characteristics, is the tool of god in punishing human sin according to the sanction of divine justice.77 Thus the third kind of daemon, the wicked one, described by the Greeks as infected, is an important part of the divine scheme of keeping man on the right path. Daemons of this kind are capable of doing harm to man78 and are rightly called desertores angeli?9 They are in contact with matter, silva , which, said Calcidius, the ancients called 'bad sour (maligna anima)}0 Calcidius noted the opinion of some philosophers who, referring to Plato's authority, assumed that daemons are souls freed from corporeal exertion. Those who were formerly souls of good people become ethereal daemons, while those who were wicked become harmful daemons and resume their terrestrial bodies after one thousand years.81 He quoted Empedocles and Pythagoras as authorities82 and hastened to add that Plato disagreed with such opinions, giving a brief exposition of why daemons cannot be the same as the souls of the dead.83 First of all, he said, Plato in the Republic states that the soul of a tyrant was tortured by a daemon, and therefore the two must be different entities.84 Furthermore, god created daemons before he created human souls, since daemons were supposed to watch over man.85 While the concept of the mean involves the assumption that the mean binds together the two extremes, Calcidius, when arguing that daemons are rational beings, used the concept in a slightly different way. Since both extremes, the stars and men, are rational beings, it follows that daemons, who occupy a middle position, are rational too. In the course of presenting this argument, Calcidius described mankind using a negative rhetoric not to be found elsewhere in the Commentary. He argued that it is absurd to imagine that divine beings would be 76 Comment. 135; 176,5-9. 77 'scelerum et impietatis ultores iuxta iustitiae divinae sanctionem' Comment. 135; 176,9-10. 78 Comment. 135; 176,11-12. 79 Comment. 135; 176,13. 80 Calcidius refers to Numenius as the source for the equation of silva with bad souls, see Comment. 297 ; 299, 14-300,3. 81 Comment. 136; 176,15-177,1. 82 Comment. 136; 177, 1-4. 83 Comment. 136; 177,5-10. 84 Plato, Republic 10 615e. 85 Yet Calcidius thought that the most excellent souls could, after three re-incarnations, become free of the burden of becoming embodied again and could be elevated to the aerial or even ethereal region.

Or it could equally be consciously applied rhetoric. Calcidius adopted a Christian position and vocabulary in characterising mankind, the tone and the content of which were foreign to the rest of his text. He may have chosen to intensify his argument by using Christian rhetoric or the device of parody. This negative view of man was offered as a comparison with the positive Platonic image of mankind.87 Calcidius aimed his Commentary at a Latin-speaking audience, one that was familiar with the Latin, rather than Greek Platonic tradition. The most influential patristic author, Augustine, probably a near contemporary of Calcidius, in his De civitate Dei gave a critical summary of what he considered the Platonic teaching on daemons. He was also concerned with mediation between god and man and used properties in describing the mean but unlike Calcidius, he was not interested in the harmony of the created universe and the connection among its parts. For him man was miserable and mortal and the mediator he imagined had to act as the saviour who rescues man from misery. Calcidius' image of the created universe was based on the assumption that the Demiurge's goodness assures that it is the best possible universe and thus it needs no other world to make up for its shortcomings. While criticising Apuleius, the platonici , and Plotinus, Augustine rejected both angels and daemons as mediators.88 Angels, who are immortal and happy, possess divine qualities. Daemons, on the other hand, called by Augustine medii angeli mali ,89 are immortal and miserable. For Augustine, beatitudo in the next life was the goal for which daemons could not claim to act as mediators.90 Thus the real mediator for Augustine was Christ, whose mediation is manifest in that he facilitates man's participation in divinity.91 Calcidius' passages on daemons could be a criticism of the new developments in Christian theology in defence of the Greek Middle Platonic tradition of philosophy. 6. Conclusion Calcidius' Commentary to Plato's Timaeus sets out from the statement that mathematics provides the basis and key for the understanding of the dialogue. The first part of the Commentary accordingly gives an introduction to the concepts and mathematical methods 86 'Etenim est absurdum homines quidem imam mundi regionem inhabitantes fragili corpore, animo cum amentia et sine sinceritate pleno paenitudinis ob inconstantiam commotionum suarum, alias aliis atque aliis placentibus, rationabiles animantes putari.' Comment. 130; 172,16-20. 87 Calcidius' use of the expression 'our genus', instead of 'man', adds a personal flavour to the argument, and blends the terminology of logic with the human involvement it describes. He implicated himself in the conflicting world of desires and passions, and the objective argument assumed personal dimensions. Instead of denouncing human passions he elevated them by attributing them to divine creatures, daemons, announcing that they are a necessary property for daemons in their role as mediators. They need to be subject to passions, as it is emotions that make them capable of being attuned to human feelings. For Augustine's criticism see esp. De civitate Dei VIII, 13-16 and IX, 6-23. 89 De civ. Dei IX, 14. 90 De civ. Dei IX, 15. 9 1 De civ. Dei IX, 15. The mediator role of Christ, of course, could have been established through properties. His mortality and beatitude could serve as the properties creating a mean, as an alternative to daemons' immortality and misery.</page><page sequence="14">1 42 ANCIENT APPROACHES TO PLATO' S TIMAEUS involved in the exegesis. Calcidius singled out the concept of the continuous geometrical proportion as that around which the Platonic universe is built, and made it the methodological centre of his own Commentary . But in what way can a mathematical concept be used in non-mathematical contexts? Calcidius took the concept of the continuous geometrical proportion and applied it to topics barely touched upon by Plato. He used the mathematical formula and terminology in a thoroughly Platonic manner to expand inwardly the Platonic universe. He inserted daemons into the Platonic cosmos using other dialogues for filling in the details. He linked the parallel between the elemental properties and the properties of daemons to the spatial structure of the cosmos. By doing so, he incorporated daemons in the Platonic universe of the Timaeus and made them its organic part by applying the same laws that governed the Platonic world-soul and body. While the place of daemons is defined on the macro-level of cosmology, their function is described from an anthropocentric perspective, both relating to their being 'means' . Calcidius' passages on daemons are an ingenious construct whose creation was an exploration into the possibilities of applying mathematics in a non-mathematical context. With the use of mathematical concepts for what he proposed was the subject of epoptica , Calcidius offered mathematics as the method of thinking that transcends human senses and is capable of higher contemplation.
