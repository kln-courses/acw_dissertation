<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction Delimiting Psychopoetics In her opening to the 1977 issue of Yale French Studies devoted to "Lit- erature and Psychoanalysis," Shoshana Felman challenges the common view according to which literature, a body of language to be interpreted, is submitted to psychoanalysis, a body of knowledge whose competence is used to interpret. One of the alleged motives for this questioning of the common view of the relation between "discipline" and "object" is the feeling many critics have that literature is not recognized as such by psychoanalysis; that, therefore, it is misused, misread, unrecognized in its specificity. And why should psychoa- nalysis display such arrogance, being itself, among other things, a body of language, while literature is a body of knowledge in its own way? Felman pursues the argument stressing the mutual inclusion of the two fields: "in much the same way as literature falls within the realm of psychoanalysis (within its competence and its knowledge) psychoanalysis itself falls within the realm of literature, and its specific logic and rhetoric" (7). The mutuality between the two takes the form of a paradoxical subject-object relation: the work of literary analysis resembles the work of the psychoanalyst, while the status of the object, the text, is not that of a patient but that of a master. Conversely, the literary critic resembles the analyst in his work of interpreting the text, and the patient in the relation of transference. (Note that this confusing implication of both still does not fall under the taboo of an analogic argument. The relation may be complicated; it is not inextricable.) Compared to these concepts, the scope of the present issues is, however, more limited. If Felman's scornful metaphor applies, the issues do promote psychoanalysis, but at the same time relativize the metaphor. Although the mutuality between the two fields cannot be denied, and may indeed be one of the hidden motives for the taboo on the approach in some circles, the papers presented here are meant to examine the cognitive relation, not as absolutely one-sided, but yet as one in which the starting point is the question of how psychoanalysis can inform poetics, rather than the other way around. Indeed, the search for a "psychopoetics" is broad enough in itself and can only be touched upon here. It is not for a determined epistemological presupposition that the concept of the issue is narrowed down to the relevance of psychoa- nalysis to poetics. Rather, the sloppiness of the relation, as it is more often than not displayed in certain studies, has not been retained here; the question what a psychopoetics is/can be shall be the crucial one in the following dis- cussions. STYLE: Volume 18, No. 3, Summer 1984 241</page><page sequence="2">242 Mieke Bal The relation between psychoanalysis and literature presupposed by the term "psychopoetics" is the following. Psychoanalysis is considered as an un- stable, questionable, but as yet undeniably functioning body of language used as knowledge about the human mind and behavior, specifically its unconscious parts, related to the conscious ones. It is used as a "medium range theory" embedded in a more complex procedure (Wolfi). As such, it can both be chal- lenged by and related to literature in general and various literary phenomena in particular. It informs poetics from its own angle of vision. Psychopoetics is, then, a poetics- that is, a body of language about literature, used as knowl- edge, characterized by a relation of information with psychoanalysis. That relation is not one of master and slave, as Felman (6) suggests, for the infor- mation is not a priori acceptable nor is it a direct subject-object relation. Indeed, it is not literature itself but poetics- that is, the body of statements about literature- that is informed by psychoanalysis. Accordingly, poetics is not defenseless against the information which it can reject, adjust, or selectively use. Nor is psychoanalysis its only informant. Psychopoetics is one part of general poetics that will always interact with others. It is partial in its concern with traces of unconscious processes and the way these traces interact with other textual elements. It is hermeneutically oriented in its search for mean- ingful interpretations for which it tries to construct appropriate conditions, and it is critical in its striving for explanation within socio-historical contexts. It is not monolithic, but it consists of very divergent statements on various phenomena, from the literary process in general to the conditions of writing and reading, to specific genres, figures and structures, works of authors, singular texts. All those statements coherently hold together by their reductibility to statements drawn from psychoanalytic theory and practice. It is not as yet a full, coherent theory but it consists of elements of a possible theory, from which a method, a taxonomy, an axiology, a hermeneutics and, indeed, a critical method can be drawn. In a first attempt to delimit the specificity of psychopoetics as a field of study, Gallop presents, in the first paper of the Poetics section entitled "The Field," the problematic status of the age-old division between "humanities" and "science" from an original, that is, a "local" point of view. If the scission in the academic fields is that between humanities and sciences in some coun- tries, in others there is another split between "letters" and, what should be called to avoid misunderstanding, "the other humanities." The labels are, of course, far from innocent, displaying each a thorough insight into their own fields, if not a presupposition of what they are really concerned with. The change, within psychoanalysis, from humanistic inferences to scientific lin- guistics is in that sense a significant one. Gallop analyzes the reading process as the most basic part of psychopoetics, since it has a specific relation to interpretation as an exercise of power. The key concept of transference is perhaps the marked point where psychopoetics can be constructed as informed</page><page sequence="3">Introduction 243 by psychoanalysis. The process of transference being the structuration of the interpretative authority, the analysis of it in the reading process has a critical dimension from the start. Rogers seeks to inform a process model of a scientific hermeneutics which would conceive of understanding as the awareness of the organization of pat- terns of information. His is an informational model which would be holistic in purpose, hence, less exclusively focused on language. Analyzing the main assumptions of discourse analysis and post structuralism, both linguistically oriented, Rogers is able to formulate preconditions for such a model. Drawing upon both Habermas' concept of self-reflection, which includes not only the interpretation of the meaning of distorted texts but also of distortion itself, and upon Rabbinic thinking with its openness and dialectically critical attitude, combined with commitment to method, the author can integrate the contri- bution of psychoanalysis in the model. He does so only after first criticizing its limitations in relation to thematics and to a focus of inquiry. The holistic perspective does not necessarily include, however, the need for concrete com- pleteness, totality, but, rather, the assumption that one should not lose sight of the whole. If psychopoetics is, as a matter of course, narrowed down to its specific concerns, the holistic perspective will not exclude the approach but include it, while safeguarding the integration with other forms of poetics. Rog- ers' theoretic epistemology, indeed, promotes such attitudes. In an overview of the development theory as held in psychoanalytic theory, compared to Piage≈•s theory, Grimaud broadens the scope of psycho- poetics even more. He favors an extension of the approach to all psychologic theories which can in any way inform poetics. True, the closure of the concept to psychoanalysis may only wrongly suggest that there is no way to integrate other psychologies. His interesting attempt to open up, rather than delimit the field, has the advantage to link this issue with other special issues of Poetics, especially the one on cognitive psychology and literature. If his view of poetics as multidisciplinary and multi-methodical may seem to become unmanagea- ble, it rightly necessitates a rethinking of the relations to other disciplines and the choices we make, most of which have an arbitrary aspect. Only on that basis can one hope that a multidisciplinary approach will evolve toward gen- uine interdisciplinarity. Van Heusden, from outside the discipline, places the papers of this section in the framework of one semiotic theory, the one which is mainly related to Hayden White's metahistory. Van Heusden studies the different dimensions of poetics, which enables him to consider the field of psychopoetics in a similar fashion. Thus, he anticipates already the next section, where Orlando will consider the different approaches in Freud's writings as variously acceptable because their scopes differ, their procedures and aims vary, and their place in the different dimensions of poetics is divergent.</page><page sequence="4">244 Mieke Bal Psychopoetics and Method The relationship between psychoanalysis and literary texts, between read- ings and writings, has taken different routes, most of them not or hardly ac- companied by their own proponents' critique. I will first delineate a few models as they have been practiced by psychopoeticians, then sketch the awkward position the discipline has often taken- and been forced to take- in the meth- odology debate; the papers of the second section will come to stand in the light of the need for rational justification and recognition, a concern most familiar to the readers of Poetics. One widely practiced and questionable model is the analogical model of psychopoetics, mostly taking the form of psychocriticism. In her introduction to the Yale French Studies issue, Felman explains why literature and psycho- analysis have more in common than not. Even if, as she rightly shows, the relation is not purely analogical, since the different positions of analyst and patient are unevenly distributed among text and reader or critic, the basic assumption is clearly the strong analogy not only between the products of each practice, but also between the processes themselves. In the early days of what was then called psychocriticism, the analogy was based on one of two com- parisons. A first, most common one studies texts insofar as they display the "story" of the psychoanalytic development theory. Numerous "cases" of oed- ipal desires, incest taboos, and their transgressions were collected, and inter- pretations of classical masterpieces as oedipally motivated appeared. Jones's interpretation of Hamlet's hesitations is perhaps the most famous example. A methodological discussion of this type of criticism is hardly called for at this point. I wish to stress, however, risking to take an unfashionable position, that many objections against it simply do not hold. The argument that Jones did not take the structural composition of the play into account, for example, can easily be countered by the remarks he makes on the function of the play-in- the-play. On the other hand, it is a fact that the very question- why does Hamlet not kill his uncle right away?- falls under the "how many children had Lady Macbeth?" type of question. Reformulated as a typically readerly question- that is, taking as a starting point not the text but the response it provokes, using empirical methods for the collection of data concerning response (Groe- ben; Holland)- it is not a priori an unacceptable question, and Jones's answer to it can be differently situated as well. Nevertheless, the great majority of analyses of this type are not considered as "literary" enough, while their un- derlying assumptions are not accepted any longer. The second comparison is the one between text and psychoanalytic theory itself. Although it presents the same problems, this comparison can be illu- minating in several aspects. First, it illustrates psychoanalytic theory; hence, it can be used as a didactic tool. In fact, that is how Freud used it. From a critical point of view, those comparisons are even alleged as evidence that the</page><page sequence="5">Introduction 245 whole theory is mythically based. This is, however, an unjust critique. It mis- understands both myth and its relation to science, while it also misses the difference between the context of discovery and the context of justification. It is the same type of argument as the one alleged by the school of Greimas, whose analyses of scientific texts demonstrate narrative aspects in those texts, implying, then, that this undermines the scientific status of the texts. The relationship between narrativity and discursivity is not thoroughly argued to start with, while the model itself on which the analysis is based is not in itself examined and could very well presuppose the necessity of narrativity in any text. The problem with the second comparison drawn from the analogical model is a different one. It considers texts as staged theories, thus neglecting the different status of theories and their object. To demonstrate that a literary text displays features of the psychoanalytic process- that is, that it holds in- stances of condensation, transference, or repression- is not a revealing con- clusion as such. The relation must, in spite of Felman's preference for a more democratic mutuality, be reversed. The psychoanalytic process of condensa- tion, transference, and repression should not be seen as staged in the text, but as concepts which allow analysis of literary phenomena which manifest those features. But, then, the analogical model is not applied any longer; it is replaced by what I will call the "specification model." The example of the creation story in Genesis 2-3 may illustrate this. Using the first comparison of the analogical model, one could say that the creatures "man" and "woman" who, at the end of Chapter 2, are "naked but not ashamed," resemble the child who has not yet gained awareness of his/ her body. When they discover their nakedness later, and, indeed, become ashamed, they can be considered to have grown up. The comparison is more detailed. The shame is not caused by their sheer nakedness, but by the ap- pearance of YHWH, the third person who institutes difference, hence, law. Retrospectively, then, the undifferentiated earth-creature which was first formed, and which is not a man but a non-sexual being, represents the infant who cannot yet differentiate between itself and the other, taking the parts of the mother's body as parts of its own. The whole story becomes, then, an illus- tration, not only of the story of the development theory, with its specific char- acters-the infant and its motherly total environment, here the earth; the child who discovers difference when s/he becomes aware of the body at the ap- pearance of the third person, the father; and the grown children who test reality by transgressing the interdiction of the father, in order to become adults in their own right. It also dramatizes the theory itself: it shows how the desire to become like the father necessitates repression of older desires whose ar- cheology has been buried with the death/sleep of the pre-oedipal child who is reborn as sexually differentiated. (For an extensive analysis of this text, see Bal, "Sexuality, Sin and Sorrow.")</page><page sequence="6">246 Mieke Bal At its best, such an interpretation sheds a specific light on a story, which can be interpretated in many other ways. The case is interesting, because it has, indeed, been used, not only by psychoanalysis, but by other disciplines as well. Different currents in evolutionary anthropology each differently in- terpret the story (see Reed). The use of the two comparisons, however, does not protect the text against any arbitrary interpretation, nor have they given any insight in the text drawn from the theory. In fact, the theory and its interpretative schemes have been taken as a whole, as a story in themselves, which is superposed on the other story. Such doubling is a much-practiced procedure which presents the inconvenience not only of being basically non- falsifiable, but also of allowing no surplus knowledge to be gained. The analogical model in itself cannot, therefore, be considered as a method. It is not, however, completely pointless. The import of the analogic mode of thinking is, as both Rogers and Van Heusden argue, basic to our ways of dealing with the world as it is accessible in discursive practice. The procedure presented here should be seen as one instance of that mode. It helps in different ways to gain access to discursive items which do not by themselves deliver their meanings, that is, offer precisely the analogies we need to make meaning. Hence, those interpretations have didactic, semiotic, and communicative value; object rather than method, they offer interesting material for the study of the place and function of psychoanalytic concepts in everyday life. A variant of this model is what may be called the specification model. It uses psychoanalysis as a searchlight theory, allowing specific features of texts or readings to be illuminated, sometimes explained, by means of psychoan- alytic concepts. The goal of such interpretations is not to confirm the psy- choanalytic content of the material, but to make explicit in what ways the presumed subject exposes itself as existing through various psychoanalytically theorized problems. For instance, Verhoeff s analysis of Constant's Adolphe is not conceived to demonstrate that the title-character has symptoms of a pre- oedipal complexe d'abandon which pushes him to leave women in order not to be left by them. Quite to the contrary, specific textual elements like the famous phrase, "je veux √™tre aim√©, me dis-je, et je regardais autour de moi," (I want to be loved, I said to myself, and I looked about me), where the conjunction et has puzzled many critics, are interpreted in the light of the pre- oedipal trouble in order to analyze their interrelations which form a network of highly symptomatic, but at the same time literary, instances. The novel does not display the psychoanalytic concept, then, but a unique version of it, which turns the book into what it is: a great novel which irritated many of its readers. Hence, the text forms not only the object of the analysis, but the interaction between author and readers as well. True, thus analyzed the novel becomes in its turn an informant of psychoanalysis. It makes an interesting case, stimulating the use of literature as document for the social sciences. But such is not the goal of the hermeneutic project.</page><page sequence="7">Introduction 247 The study of Adolphe analyzes and interprets features recognized as lit- erary devices: metaphors and their distribution in the novel, in relation to the diegetic moment; the split of the narrative voice, and its unequal distribution, which enhances specific effects; the problem of identification; the status of diegetic truth and the protagonists' attitude towards it. The psychoanalytic theory informs that analysis, but it does not reduce it. There lies the difference between the two models discussed until now. The specification model protects hermeneusis against reduction, while, as we have seen, the analogical model rather encourages the latter. Analogy is a summarizing procedure, while spec- ification is an extending one. (For a detailed discussion, see Skura.) The two models are, however, not contradictory, and indeed, combi- nations of them are many. In case of combination, the second procedure pro- tects the text against the reduction yielded by the analogical model, for it allows specification of the features which may anchor the analogy but still remain textual phenomena which require explanation. The case of Genesis 2-3 may again illustrate this. The literary problem the text presents is that of the unity of the character. Indeed, most theories of character presuppose the stability of characters in the course of the text. They do admit evolution, change, reversal of being and appearance, elimination of characters, but the very possibility of change depends on the assumption of some sort of semiotic "existence" which remains unaltered. (See Rimmon-Kenan and Hamon.) One can change only what is constantly present. If, on the other hand, one assumes the applicability of the analogical model, one of the consequences it implies is the disruption of the character. For in that case, the creature formed in verset 2:7, and which remains the same until 2:20 only, is basically a different "character," an on- tologically separate one, from the new set of characters formed after the "pro- found sleep" of the first character. Similarly, the woman and the man before the so-called transgression are basically different beings, to be distinguished from the characters which present the rather realistic image of the human condition of the adult. The psychoanalytic theory of development informs the analogical interpretation, which cannot, however, validate itself as a procedure of literary analysis. But once the interpretation is established, it can draw further support from, and clarify at the same time, the literary problematics of the convention which presupposes the stability of character. Indeed, once the stages of the creation/development of the anthropomorphic characters are differentiated, it is easy to see the possibility of a general hypothesis about fictional characters. They can be assumed, then, to be "slices" of semiosis, where the relation between the different entities is at least as constitutive as the diachronic evolution of one entity and where no continuity can be pre- supposed. As a result, the concept of character becomes the means of its own deconstruction, and instead of serving the ideologically pernicious interpret- ations based on retrospective unification, like those which claim women in-</page><page sequence="8">248 Mieke Bal ferior because "Eve was informed after Adam," it will serve as a critique of those influential readings. The main point, here, is the possibility to use psychoanalytic theory to inform literary theory, by means of hermeneutic specification. It is not so much the contribution of psychoanalysis to the interpretation itself, as the possibility it offers to gain access to literary features, hence to inform concepts of literary theory without losing sight of the literary object itself. It is the spanning of the gap between the two disciplines, then, which protects from arbitrary and un- controllable interpretation. In the given example, the literary problem of char- acter, one of the conspicuous examples of the difficulty of literary theory to reach knowledge beyond na√Øve realism, is also used as a protective concept in that it sets the limits to psychoanalytic speculation. Without the intermediate position of the concept, there would be no way to yield privilege to this par- ticular interpretation, but the combination allows one to overcome the tau- tological aspect of the analogical model. In this particular case, supplementary check points can be built in: given the abundant material, evidence from an- thropological sources (Oosten and Moyer) and even from Talmudic practice (L√©vinas) confirms parts of the result, while in its turn is further informed by it. Hence, the combination of the searchlight theory with the one that needed information fulfills a new searchlight function in relation to other theories. This interaction between different disciplines certainly comes close to the in- terdisciplinarity required by Grimaud. Paradoxically, then, psychoanalysis does not close off or reduce, but on the contrary opens up and extends its scope to other disciplines. In this context, another variant of the analogical model must be viewed less positively. I am referring to what may be called the medical model. It is the procedure that comes closest to the reversal of the information relation. Psychoanalysis is, then, not so much the informant but the informed discipline. There is nothing inherently wrong with the use of literature as document for psychoanalysts, if they think they can overcome the problems of the difference between unconscious discourse and written, elaborated texts. But the medical model is also used by psychocritics whose aim, then, seems to be to demon- strate that a given author, character, or even text suffers certain troubles, has dreams which mean specific things and are symptomatic (Bellemin-No√´l). The result of the analysis, in those cases, is as clear as possible a picture of the disease. Of course, stated like this, no literary critic would openly adhere to such a position. The practice of this type of criticism is, however, far from extinguished. The problem is not so much that the text has no unconscious, or that the status of textual features is questionable in relation to symptomatics; rather, this is a psychoanalytic rather than a poetic problem. The main problem is, I think, one of information content. Indeed, such interpretations offer results that are coherent and complete in one sense, the medical one, but assemble disparate and detailed features of the literary corpus without justifying their</page><page sequence="9">Introduction 249 relative importance within the overall object of study. Contrary to the speci- fying model, and even to the simple analogical model, there is no check on the type of information drawn from the object. It is theoretically possible to build up a coherent picture of a neurosis on the basis of loose ends and ar- bitrarily picked words. What is lacking is the double check the specifying model offers. The required coherence of the depiction of the trouble is not balanced by a similar requirement on the literary side. The random character of the material as part of a literary object makes the procedure pointless for poetics. What I will indicate here as the hermeneutic model of psychopoetics is distinguishable from the previously exposed procedures in that it does not use the content of psychoanalysis to inform poetics, but, instead, draws on its basic assumptions and axioms, its theorizing of the unconscious, its ideas on lan- guage, the subject and the relations between both, as keys and as descriptive concepts for interpretation. This procedure is not so much interested in traces of the oedipal drama or the pre-oedipal confusions, but rather in traces of the unconscious and the forms it takes which disturb coherency: signs of censorship like condensation and displacement; contradictions and incoherencies and their status in relation to the coherent, "conscious" statements of the text; and their ability to disturb the common interpretations which seek coherency. If carefully used, it can yield surplus information, it can relate to traditionally acknowl- edged literary problems, and it can contribute to the rethinking of the subject in the socio-cultural sciences. Interpretation is now commonly recognized as both indispensable and inherent to any discursive practice, and methodologically problematic in that it cannot separate itself from its object/subject matter. The latter difficulty cannot be radically overcome; it does, however, allow relative differentiation. The use of the language of another hermeneutic theory can eventually create the indispensable if relative distance between the object-language and the her- meneutic metalanguage, or, as it is more appropriately called, paralanguage. Without allowing the critic to step out of the discursive event, it does, then, allow him/her to draw a new body of language into it, thus adding new elements which shed new light on it. The case of Genesis 37-39 can illustrate this possibility. In traditional, philologically informed hermeneutics, Genesis 38 is con- sidered problematic. It is the story of Judah who conceives twin sons/grandsons with his daughter-in-law Tamar, who tricked him into it because he had failed to keep his promise. The chapter poses the problem of continuity, a frequently thematized issue in biblical narrative. Indeed, in Chapters 37 and 39 we learn about the misadventures of Judah's younger brother Joseph, who is sold by his brothers as a slave in 37, and misused by his master's wife in 39. Between the three chapters, there is neither temporal nor thematic continuity, and many biblical scholars comment on this problem. One group (Speiser 299) assumes that 38 has been displaced by subsequent editing. Another (Alter) on the other</page><page sequence="10">250 Mieke Bal hand defends thematic similarity among the three chapters. Alter cannot, how- ever, analyze how the thematic structure would yield a certain continuity, nor can he explain why the rather loose thematic similarities between 37/39 and 38 can be assumed to have motivated the editorial policy. Indeed, both critics arrive at their conclusions without considering either the poetic or the possible psychoanalytic motivations, let alone the relations between the two. Therefore, their hermeneutic efforts cannot reach beyond reductive paraphrase. Now, the sequence of the three chapters displays a tension between sim- ilarity and difference which does yield a certain type of continuity, while look- ing very much like the half admitted, half censored signification of some un- conscious meaning. In the three, family relations are thematized. Each time, a subject is deceived with the help of an object. The object in question serves as evidence of the presence of a subject at the moment the crucial event takes place. The object is metonymically related to the identity of the subject. The m√©tonymie bond itself is questioned, or rather, differentiated from its variant: the object is part of the synecdochic subject's equipment not independent by itself, thus leaving space for mistakes or falsification. The object is, however, a significant or central part of the equipment; hence it is used as evidence of the victim's identity; it is mistaken as synecdoche. Since the object is ac- knowledged at the end as absolute evidence, it becomes a metaphor of the subject which can, by means of that reification, recover its subjective status which was in danger. Most of the thematic similarities are identified by the critics who defend continuity. They do not, however, interpret them further, so that the analysis remains paraphrastic: the text delivers these details, but they do not as such make sense within the biblical conception of continuity. If some editing policy would be inferable from these elements, it would be a rather sloppy, hasty action on the basis of thematic relations which are just obvious enough to assume that "the three chapters have something to do with each other." Psy- choanalytic theory with its insistence on the "letter" (Lacan) on one hand, on the textual detail that is, and with its stress on family and sexual relations on the other hand, can pursue the inquiry further. Indeed, the seducer in 37 is the misused victim's brothers. In 39, the seducer is a woman. In the proble- matic chapter, the seducer is also a woman, but, contrary to 39, she is justified since she was trapped in the first place. Here the victim is the initial seducer. In 38, the trap concerns a woman and a set of brothers, and as such, the chapter is a pivot between the two others. In 37, the brothers ill-use their innocent brother. In 39, the woman misuses the same young man. In 37, he suffers for his filial obedience. Separated from his father, facing woman in 39, he keeps his innocence, which now becomes sexual purity. In 37 and 38, the father is deceived. In 38, however, the father is also the deceiver. In both cases, the father overprotects his young son. In 39, the father is replaced by the social father-figure, the master. This father is deceived like the father in 37 and 38,</page><page sequence="11">Introduction 25 1 but he participates in the misuse of the son by letting himself be deceived. He thus resembles both the father in 37 who cannot protect his son any further and the father in 38 who deceives in his turn, if, this time, unaware. Two more displacements between the three tales censor the similarities. The object with the help of which the deception takes place consists of clothes in 37 and 39. Undressing the innocent victim obviously is the first step towards deception and ill-treatment. In 38, the object is threefold and consists of the signs of paternal dignity. The father being the deceived person, this symbolic undressing replaces the more concrete one, which would be highly inappro- priate. Secondly, the position of sexuality is different in each case. In 37, the whole topic seems irrelevant, except for three details: the undressing, the blood smeared onto the dress, and the separation from the family, which brings the young man into sexual danger. In 39, sexuality shifts from the side to the center. The undressing is here literally meant for sexual purposes. The dress is considered as evidence of sexual misbehavior, and rightly so: the young man is imprisoned for having undressed, officially for having committed, but in fact for having refused sex. The position of the brothers moves to the opposite direction. In 37, they are central and clearly guilty, as is the woman in 39. In 38 they are less central, not involved in the deception (except for the younger brother, who is indirectly involved) and their position in sexual matters is highly problematic. In 39, they have disappeared. The position of the character Tamar, on the one hand, and that of the set of brothers, fathers, and sons in the whole sequence, on the other, becomes clear in verset 28:24-26. The issue is Judah's readiness to condemn to death the woman guilty of his own act. In other words, he is confusing subjects, problematizing the distinction between subject and object. What exactly is Tamar's role? She is a focalizer (see Bai Narr otologie) in the first place. She sees what Judah does not see. In 14, she sees the injustice done to her. In 16- 17, she sees that Judah is not to be trusted. Judah, in his turn, sees a whore ( zonah ) where the narrator points to a cultural servant (wrongly referred to in philology as "cult prostitute"), indicated by the word gedeshah, and where the character is a relative. In 25, she forces him to see the truth. In fact, her wit, used to restore what was wrong, serves to make Judah see his own neurotic errors. His error was the illusion that the course of history can continue while protecting his son from the imaginary danger: the woman. Instead, historical chronology had to be restored: first man has to do away with his fear of woman; then the new generation can be conceived. To show him this, Tamar had to veil herself, seeing without being seen. The double camouflage is needed: man is so afraid that the woman has to cover herself in order to trick him into having sex; and for the truth, his own fear, to be revealed, because it is so shameful, it can only be uncovered by a strategem of covering. "Discern," says Tamar to Judah in 25, "whose these are." The children she bears are fathered by the owner of the patriarchal attributes she possesses. Discernment is what</page><page sequence="12">252 Mieke Bal she teaches him. Her action does not provide her the husband which was her goal. It does provide Judah with the offspring he was longing for. The course of history, interrupted by this episode, can be resumed. As an account of self-insight won by the help of the feared woman, the tale serves within the sequence as advice not to fear for Joseph excessively. The very dangers he is entangled in by his contact with the woman will be the source of his future power. In fact that is what happens: from the prison, he is called to reign. The weak position of Judah's sons is reflected in his own weakness: the powerful father is helpless without the Other. He is dependent on the place he occupies in the system, the Other. Narration is an expression of the system. The history of the formation of the subject is interrupted here only to show how unavoidable the course of chronology is. The paralepsis (Genette 195), the narrative figure which constitutes the problem in the se- quence, is, then, in the first place a sign that refers to its own limited possibility. Dependent as it is on the subject in relation to which chronology and its disruptions are to be interpreted, it can only expand on the very topic that, by its sheer centrality, promotes the development of the narrative. The apparent distortion in the sequence can be interpreted with its dis- torting aspects, and not in spite of them as in Alter's account. This is certainly not to say that philology is to be short-circuited. The text studied is the one that is, for some reason or another, canonized as it is. The object of study, then, is not some "original" version, but what is already a reading- the edition we have. Sensitivity to the unconscious problems as outlined above is assumed to have motivated the edition. Indeed, the assumption of text-corruption or displacement is another way of repressing the conflict, just as is the readiness to smooth the problem out by unproblematic thematics. Psychoanalysis serves as a heuristic tool, but unlike the specifying model, this procedure interprets problems rather than texts. The problem outlined here was a philological one, chosen purposely because the strongest resistances against psychopoetics come from the more traditional disciplines. At the same time, the problem was a reading difficulty, since, first, the edition can be considered as a reading, and, second, the subsequent readings by Speiser and Alter, each with their own specific solution to the problem, are taken as objects of explanation as well. Psychoanalysis supports the presented interpretation and provides the concept of displacement and its signifying capacities as well as the assumptions on the problematic formation of the subject and its relation to problems of family and sexuality. Neither philology nor literary criticism could accomplish this. The distortion was first to be assumed, as in philological questioning, then explained, but not explained away. These four procedures, operating in isolation or in combination, are op- timally verifiable when related to problems derived from alien disciplines. That is the motivation for my insistence on problems of linguistics, philology, or poetics. The contribution psychoanalysis can offer is always limited, and it</page><page sequence="13">Introduction 253 should be delimited clearly. Only then can it be protected from, on the one hand, reductionism and at the same time imperialism, which combine to claim too little meaning with too much pretension; and protected on the other hand from misunderstandings, resistance, and refusal altogether. The previous discussion leaves, however, the methodological status of psychoanalysis as such unargued. Although it seems to me that too much attention has been diverted from problems of poetics by the sheer unending methodological challenge put on the approach, it must be admitted that psy- chopoetics can only be acceptable if its basis can be considered reasonably sound. Like any approach to any object-domain which seeks rational acknowl- edgement, psychopoetics cannot withdraw from the methodology debate. This is, however, often the attitude of its proponents. On the other hand, its an- tagonists too easily project outdated requirements, which have not proven fruitful for a progressive theory of knowledge about this particular discipline which so outrageously defies the common rules of rationality. The following statement may illustrate the problematic point: "Far from being the avenue to truth, reason may serve as a powerful defense against the recognition of truth, masking anxiety by its quest for certainty, perpetuating illusion by elab- orate rationalization" (Kaplan 77). The statement was meant to defend psy- choanalysis, but at the same time it points exactly to the bias where proponents and antagonists of the approach cease to understand each other. Claiming, as Kaplan does here, that reason and rationalism are often used as defense against the recognition of unpleasant truths or, eventually, the unpleasant recognition of the impossibility to reach the truth, is the very argument that makes the opponent powerless. If its relative truth is undeniable, that makes it only the more irritating. The statement is significant, so much so that it can almost figure a mise en abyme of the discipline it is meant to defend: it is adequate, and therefore unacceptable; it defies rules, and forces the other to revise stan- dards, under the threat of becoming the object of the statement. Whoever refuses psychoanalysis represses it. The statement should not, however, be taken as an "anything goes" de- vice, nor is it necessarily an attack on rationality. First, it should be considered within the context of the already forgotten debates of the fifties, where even Hempel had to admit, and in fact did admit frankly, that "it is precisely the 'fictitious concepts rather than those fully definable by observables' that en- abled science to proceed to explanation and prediction" (Frenkel-Brunswick 107). Horwitz formulates this even more polemically when he writes: Most philosophers now recognize that rigid operationalism leads to an undue narrowness and sterility in science and that only through the use of "fictitious concepts" or "hypothetical constructs" which may have a tenuous tie with the level of observation can the creative scientist construct the theories which will ultimately clarify the unknowns in nature. (124) Scriven finds the operationalist-empiricist position untenable for that reason: "a term is fruitful only if it encourages changes in its own meaning; and, to</page><page sequence="14">254 Mieke Bal some considerable extent, this is incompatible with operational definition" (113). In other words, Kaplan's statements, like other, similar ones, should not be considered out of context and interpreted as a refusal to accept ration- ality as a standard for the evaluation of psychoanalysis as a scientific discipline. On the contrary, it is meant to encourage reflection about those standards, not with the idea of adopting them for the sake of opportunism but for the purpose of gaining deeper insight into rationality itself. According to Habermas' newest book, rationality should not be measured in its cognitive dimension only. Behaving in a rational way means having good reasons for cognitive, moral, practical, evaluative, expressive, and hermeneutic decisions. His extensive account of the rules that within a given social envi- ronment can decide whether the said reasons are good is not relevant here, but the main point, the broader view of rationality, that is, may serve not to protect psychopoetics against rational critique but on the contrary to practice that critique in a reasonable, subtle way. In different ways from different viewpoints and with different standards, three papers in the issue of Poetics consider the method of psychopoetics. Orlando examines the procedures Freud applied when he discussed literature. Distinguishing eleven different procedures, he demonstrates that already at its beginnings the approach was not unified, hence, should not be discussed as if it were. Orlando's attitude is, I would say, doubly hermeneutic in the first place. His concern is to interpret Freud's statements as procedures in order to display their eventual usefulness for a hermeneutic psychopoetics. Sullivan's is a different goal. She practices the reversible relationship between the two fields, as indicated by Felman, in such a way as to draw from one body of psychoanalytic language statements on what poetics can do with it. Westlund, who comments upon this section from his own point of view, finds the La- canian poetics not entirely satisfying, mainly because of its one-sidedness. He develops another direction that psychopoetics can also take, thus enriching the scope of the section. Groeben, on the other hand, examines claims on which psychoanalysis bases its procedures, before entering into the specific problems of psychopoetics as dependent on the former. His standards differ from those implied by the empiricist background of the two other contributors to this section. He thus allows the reader to have a clearly recognizable sample of each of the two attitudes toward the discipline, between which it would be so interesting to find a rationally based common understanding. The juxtaposition of these papers in their pointed difference is one step toward that understand- ing. Westlund places the discussion in its historical context, rightly arguing against the common strategy of sticking to Freud. Other work has been done, and more recent arguments have contributed to the debate which avoid Freud's sometimes na√Øve scientism while taking the problem of the discipline's sci- entific status seriously. Westlund points to the tendency, figuring in many</page><page sequence="15">Introduction 255 works of psychopoetics, to remain faithful to a defensive attitude no longer called for in that situation. Stressing the importance of narcissism for the literary process, he attempts to extend the method toward a more socially oriented direction. Drawing upon work by Melanie Klein and Winnicott, he opens up the scope of psychopoetics to an approach informed by readerly questions which address problems of response rather than of production. He is critical of the overdemanding, hence, reductive attitude of one contributor, as well as of the lack of historical awareness of the two others. In combination with the three papers of this section, Westlund's comment gives an idea of the actual position of the approach in the methodology debate. He concludes by addressing the question which arises from Kaplan's quoted statement: that is, why psychopoetics has more difficulty in justifying itself, than, say, structural criticism. Taking the question seriously, he suggests that the problem can be overcome. Criticism and Critique Psychopoetics is shown at work in the Style part of these twin issues. Although the concept of criticism has come to cover any approach to literature, be it a set of concepts ("critical theory"), a comment or even a paraphrase, psychopoetics has a critical vocation in the more specific, German sense. In the context of the debate between the proponents of the Frankfurt School and the positivist sociologists, a critical theory is not a theory of literary criticism but a theory which is itself critical in the pointed, programmatic sense. Without discussing literature at all, Habermas (1968) uses psychoanalysis as a paradigm of critical science because of its inherently self-critical structure. True, Ha- bermas' model of the use of critical theory to bring about social changes has been shown to be idealistic and transcendental. The concept itself, however, allows us to grasp the basic properties of one side of psychopoetics which is today widely discussed outside the domain of literary studies- critique of ide- ology. Critical theory is based on the idea that the limits of reality- that which resists symbolisation- are unstable. Therefore, a possible satisfaction of desires can change into an institutionally acknowledged gratification. Technical prog- ress enlarges objective possibilities to reduce the needed social repression under institutionalized systems. Utopian components of former illusion can then be freed from their embedding in ideological and estranged elements of culture. Such liberation allows a critique of the power structure because the latter has become expendable. A critical theory of culture is able to distinguish theoretical propositions which relate to invariable regularities from those which express ideologically fixed relations of dependence which could change. To the point at which ideas are used to justify actions, the rationalizations (on the individual level) or</page><page sequence="16">256 Mieke Bal ideologies (on the collective level) obliterate the uncritical relation between the subject's consciousness and the hidden interests that orient it, thus enabling the subject to create the illusion of autonomous judgments. Any critique of ideology is based on the premise that information about the pseudo-invariant relations between idea and action may trigger within the subject who is sub- jected to those pseudo laws a critical process of self-reflection. To the point that the reader is subjected to the literary text which presents such pseudo laws as "natural," a critical interpretation of literature can contribute to that process. Psychoanalysis, as Habermas argues, is doubly appropriate for this critical work. Its theory has the process in question as its object-domain, and its procedure is based on the self-reflective activity of the analysand. In much the same way, the psychopoetic critic is involved in self-reflective work while criticizing the text and the reading process. Hence the increasing attention paid to the concept of transference, stressed by Gallop and by Culler: in a sense, self-reflection is transference. The cognitive problems inherent in this view of self-reflection as a critical procedure are not easy to disentangle. The general interpretations which un- derlie the major part of psychopoetic criticism should be taken into consid- eration at this point. True, the well-known general interpretations like the Oedipus complex do allow conditioned predictions, but they do so on the basis of a methodologically neat separation between the object-domain and the the- oretical propositions they hold. The general interpretations are themselves narrative in that they explain events narratively. They show how subjects are engaged in a fabula which needs representation. Such a representation implies the claim of the fabula's uniqueness. The function of the general interpretation is precisely to undermine that claim without transgressing the limits set by narrativity. As a systematically generalized narrative, it provides us with a schema of many possible fabulas which are each unique while following pre- dictable lines. In that sense, the general interpretation functions as type. Analyst and analysand, literary text and critic, can orient themselves, not in relation to an example but to a schema. General interpretations are models in the sense that they do not use names of individuals but instead use roles, be they indicated by proper names (Oed- ipus), classes of individuals (children, parents) or by theoretical terms (subject, sender, object). They do not represent contingent situations but recurrent fig- urations, represented graphically by triangles, hexagons, lines. They do not use typical processes but they describe, by means of key concepts, the synopsis of some action with its variants. Since the terms of the model contribute to the structuration of the narrative, their formalization is not possible and even not desirable. The hermeneutic interpretation as a specific performance is not an operational application which leaves the theoretical deductions as is; it com- pletes the background the model constitutes. It defines one actualization of the general interpretation.</page><page sequence="17">Introduction 257 It is in this view that the papers by Verhoeff, Chaitin, Brooks, and Frap- pier-Mazur should be considered. They each show in a different way the critical capacities of general interpretations as mediators between both subjects in- volved in a critical work. VerhoefFs oedipal reading of Oedipus Rex insists on variation between myth, text, and model, analyzing the various modes that the analogical model allows him to uncover. Sophocles' tragedy is not the source but the product of oedipal transformation. Psychoanalysis provides the key terms in which the tragedy can be reformulated. The relation between general interpretation and specific text is illustrated by a discussion of the tensions between the Oedipus complex and the literary text, a tension which evolves from the status of characters and dramatic situation, events and the- matic structure. The conclusion, that Oedipus is surrounded by characters displaying oedipal complexes but does not have it himself, being engaged in pre-oedipal problems, is not only paradoxical; it is evidence against the charge of reductionism, and most convincingly so. The problems the character deals with in relation to the fatherly position, power, and the mother lead to an implicit critical dimension in that the latter's basically impossible position is the final work of this analysis. Starting from Freud's often discussed theory of jokes, Chaitin constructs a taxonomy of subjective modes in the beginnings of French novels. His pa- rameters relate the three persons in Freud's theory- the subject of desire, the object of love or aggression, and the addressee of the unconscious- to the three grammatical persons. The meeting ground of both systems allows the critic to elaborate three modes of narrative action as well as three types of narrative theories. He is thus able to interpret the concept of aveu, crucial to La Princesse de Cleves and typical of many subsequent novels, in its full disruptive force. Unlike Oedipus' case, the aveu is not meant to discover oneself but to disclose to others secrets, those of illegal desire. In his comment on both these essays, Sonne rightly raises the problem of knowledge in fiction, a question inherent in the texts of secrecy that the critics deal with. If knowledge is the issue of psychoanalysis itself, it is also an often evoked theme in fiction and specifically in the texts considered in this section. In Sonne's view, intertextuality is a key term which relates the problem of the unknown in fiction to the unconscious in psychoanalytic theory- informing, that is, the former by the latter. The two remaining papers of this section attempt to define narrative categories by means of psychoanalytic concepts, desire in one case, initiation in the other. Pavel expands the issue to the general one of anthropological generalizations. Brooks, unsatisfied by formalist narratology, sees the ambi- tious hero of nineteenth-century novels as the paradigm of the motoric force of Eros, which propels the narrative toward its end. His is an energetic con- ception of narrative, to be understood as a force from within. This view is exemplified by an analysis of Balzac's La Peau de chagrin, a choice challenged by Pavel. Brooks draws largely upon Beyond the Pleasure Principle when he</page><page sequence="18">258 Mieke Bal radicalizes the desire hypothesis and states that the ultimate goal of both mean- ing and narrative lies at the end, reaches for the end. In a related fashion, Frappier-Mazur starts her analysis of George Sand's La Comtesse de Rudolstadt with the identification of a lack, whose liquidation constitutes the narrative movement. The search for identity which is the force that lies behind initiation is related to the ideological problem of sexual identity. Drawing upon Kris- teva's notion of abjection as a precondition of narcissism, in fact as its primary version, the blurring of distinctions which characterizes it is related to the young woman's pains to distinguish herself from the mother. Pavel is not convinced by Frappier-Mazur's attempt at a definition of the feminine based on the novel, and he uses anthropological sources to argue so. It will be left to the reader to decide; both authors use the psychoanalytic general inter- pretation in much the same way. If called for, this provides, again, evidence for the interpretative freedom the psychoanalytic framework leaves us. Frappier-Mazur draws explicit conclusions whose critical import goes beyond criticism toward critique. The other papers suggest the potential for expansion in that direction without actually doing it themselves. In the field of sociology and mass media studies as it is practiced, among others, by the Birmingham group, psychoanalysis is much used for the construction of a theory of ideology (see Coward and Ellis, Camargo Heck, and Hall). In the line of Althusser and Lacan, these attempts struggle with the problem raised by the assumed analogy between the formation of the individual subject and the social processes which govern ideological influence- and literary com- munication. Jameson stays too close to Althusser to be able to overcome that problem, in spite of his fine work and subtle analysis; his is an overtly Marxist attempt to integrate Freudian concepts which too easily assumes the plurality of the subject as a solution. The formation of the subject is not necessarily defined in all its aspects by Lacan's somewhat fatalistic theory, as Silverman convincingly argues. But also, the social processes which constitute the object- domain of any critique of ideology cannot be accounted for without the key concept of the social in psychoanalysis- transference. Both final papers of the Style issue bring up these problems. Culler's and Abicht's reviews show what is currently being done in the United States in the field of psychopoetics. Should these two approaches be integrated in the empirical study of reading processes as practiced mainly in Germany, then there is a way to establish psychopoetics not only as a procedure for literary criticism and its theory, but also for a genuine critique of the social process of literary communication.
