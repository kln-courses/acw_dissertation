<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS LAW AND THE LAWS, being the Marginal Comments of a Theologian. By NATHANIEL MICKLEM, Principal of Mansfield College, Oxford. [Edinburgh: W. Green &amp; Son, Ltd. London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Ltd. 1952. viii and 122 pp. 15s. net.] IT is always interesting, and sometimes chastening, for lawyers to hear the views about law expressed by laymen, and here the jurist can find his familiar problems stated from the point of view of a theologian. The retiring Principal and Professor of Dogmatic Theology of Mansfield College has based his book on the Wilde Lectures which he delivered in 1949. His theme is the relation- ship between theology, moral philosophy and jurisprudence (which in medieval times would not need to be argued), his aim is directed towards a Christian philosophy of jurisprudence, and he modestly excuses himself for his temerity by asking "what theologian or what lawyer in this country has of recent years attempted seriously to relate theological and legal theory"? Although he disclaims a first-hand knowledge of many of the jurists whose theories he surveys, he has thought long and deeply about these matters, as befits the son of one of Queen Victoria's counsel now in his hundredth year. In the first two chapters Dr. Micklem discusses the relation between juris- prudence and ethics (the moral basis or aim of law) and between jurisprudence and theology ("The rejection of religion heralds the end of the reign of law," p. 16). The specialisation of the sciences has isolated law in modern times: how was it related in the past to these other and higher systems of norms? For the classical tradition of thought on this question Cicero is taken as the guide. Chapter 3 contains a good summary of Cicero's De Legibus, and it is assumed that this work represents the Graeco-Roman tradition. Medieval thought in this field is concerned with two questions, the eternal law and the law of nature (Chap. 4) and positive law and the law of nations (Chap. 5). These two chapters rely largely on Suarez, Treatise on Laws and God the Lau-giver, a choice which may be justified by the author's special interest in international law: otherwise St. Thomas Aquinas, to whom a few references are made, might be thought more representative of the medieval Christian tradition. The discussion of modern jurisprudence (Chaps. 6 and 7) is based mainly on the theories of Austin, Kelsen, Duguit, the sociological school of Roscoe Pound and the historical school of Savigny. An appeal is made for the inclusion of justice in the definition of law (pp. 50-53), and "social engineering" is reduced to "a process of tinkering" (p. 60). Chapter 8 is an eloquent plea for natural law whose aim is justice, and this idea Dr. Micklem reconciles with the findings of historical jurisprudence. He does not thihk much of natural rights, but half-heartedly admits "natural claims" (Chap. 9). The connection between theology, moral philosophy and juris- prudence is most evident in international law (Chap. 10). In the discussion of corporate personality (Chap. 11) we are asked to remember that all human associations are relations between men, not substantial essences. The conclusion of this sincere and thoughtful book is that " if the requirements of religion be overlooked . . . the requirements of the law will soon cease to be met, and, further, the law itself will insensibly change its requirements and soon turn to its own negation" (p. 113). The author has a tendency-perhaps due to his theological training-to use quotations from legal authors not as mere illustrations but as arguments or even proofs; but almost any of these quotations taken out of their context 389</page><page sequence="2">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW could form the subject of a critical question. It might appear from references to the Digest at p. 39 that the Romans used " jw gentium " to mean international law. Some allusion might have been made in Chapter 5 to the doctrine of the natural rights of States. It is said at p. 60 that "social engineering" is a phrase "not repudiated by Roscoe Pound himself." Surely Pound coined the phrase, and he likes it so much that he reiterates it in his latest book Justice according to Law. The references to legal textbooks given in the footnotes date mostly from the tinle when the lectures were delivered rather than when the book was prepared for publication. We need not be fastidious about that in a book of this kind, but two or three specific complaints may be made. References to Allen's Law in the Making are to the 1st ed. (pp. 2, 17), the 2nd ed. (pp. 7, 66), the 4th ed. (p. 67), or no edition at all (pp. 14, 20 and 91). It is strange to find Dicey's Law of the Constitution cited from the 3rd ed. (p. 17). A quotation from Sir Percy Winfield at p. 19 is said to come from the Harvard Law Review, but we must consult Paton's Jurisprudence (presum- ably the 1st ed.) to find the volume and page. The inconvenience of inconsistent or out-of-date references is increased where they are the sources of second-hand quotations. Whether "By me kings reign" comes from Chap. 7 or Chap. 8 of Proverbs must be left to theologians to decide (cf. pp. 42, 44). O. HoOD PHILLIPS. CASES ON CHURCH AND STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. By MARK DE WOLFE HOWE. Harvard University Press. [London: Geoffrey Cumberlege. 40s.] IT would be too harsh a judgment to say that the Founding Fathers shirked the issue of religion in constructing their new instrument of government, but it might be reasonable to assert that it was a subject upon which they felt less certainty than they did, for instance, on property or popular democracy. For purposes of political propaganda Jefferson could allow that men are endowed by a Creator with certain unalienable rights, but whether the Creator was an anthropomorphic God or a merely mathematical final cause did not greatly concern those wise and experienced gentlemen. The First Amendment to the Constitution mentions religion definitely and, in the context of State-building, negatively. There is to be no established religion and no obstructions to the free expression of religious ideas. Thus it has become possible to argue that the Federal Government, and, in its train, the State Governments are to be considered as definitely negative with regard to the pressures of the religiously inclined who would wish to influence government towards sympathy for their particular church or for religion in general. But the role of government as the impartial arbiter between the forces of religion and anti-religion has been difficult to maintain in an environ- nient where militant atheism has never proved as acceptable socially as moderate religion. Materialism and agnosticism have had their triumphs, notably in the Scopes trial, and their publicists of national renown in Ingersoll and Mencken; but the irreligious, it is confidently assumed, are temporary and light-hearted backsliders; they are not atheists. What have, in fact, been the practices of American communities become powerful arguments on the side of those who argue that religious sentiment is a natural and useful cement of the constitutional edifice, and that therefore this comfortable development of social values should bear more weight with the courts than formal constitutional principle. As Mr. Justice Reed put it in McColl/wm, dissenting: "Devotion to the great principle of religious liberty should not lead us into a rigid interpretation of the constitutional guarantee that conflicts with accepted habits of our people. This is an instance where, for me, the history of past practices is determinative of the meaning of a 890 VOL. 16</page></plain_text>
