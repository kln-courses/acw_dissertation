As the English version of the "Note of the Editor" states, "In the year-book studies on folk- culture in Hungary, Central and East- Europe, Asia and on theoretical problems are issued. The studies published in the year-book contain chiefly the results of the work carried out in the Institute but studies of other Hungarian and foreign scholars are issued in it, as well" [sic ]. This book demonstrates that despite the Russian influence penetrating Hungary since World War II, Hungarian folklore scholarship is still largely dependent on German studies and the German language. For example, in speaking of the spirits of the corn, the au- thor designates their various manifestations by the German terms Kornmutter, Korn- miidchen, and Alte-even when he refers to Frazer's treatment of them (p. 139). The book also contains a summary in German. The author, in addition to being one of the two contributing editors of the series, is one of the leading Hungarian folklorists; his studies on general and Hungarian folk belief and custom have been published since 1961 in various Hungarian and other European scholarly journals (the bibliography lists thirteen such contributions). The major part of this book is devoted to a survey of agricultural rites, and the works of various European scholars dealing with agricultural rites, customs, and beliefs. Wil- helm Mannhardt (to whose memory the book is dedicated) receives full treatment in the first two chapters. In the second of these chapters Mannhardt's critics come in for some sharp criticism. In the third chapter there is a brief discussion of the ideas of a number of students of the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean vegetation gods, myths, and rites (Jan de Vries, M. P. Nilsson, C. Clemen, J. G. Frazer, and others), and the author presents Frazer's well-known theories about the dying god and related concepts. Next follows a presentation of Gudmund Hatt's study of the corn mother in America and Indonesia; this leads into discussions of W. Liungman's theory of migration from the point of view of cultural botany, the theory of the transference of vegetative power of Liungman, C. W. von Sydow, D. Strinsk~i, M. P. Nilsson, V. J. Propp, and others, A. Esker6d's concept of the "dominant inter- ests" (which the author negates), the social and economic viewpoints of J. Diinninger, K. Vilkuna, I. Weber-Kellermann, the work- myth approach of L. Schmidt, the role of sacrifices in the agrarian cult, annual cus- toms as discussed by V. I. Csicserov, masked performances and plays as treated by a con- siderable number of researchers, the research on theriomorphic and anthropomorphic mythical beings, problems of diffusion, mi- gration, and change, etc. These chapters emphasize clarification of the theoretical issues by drawing upon Central and East European folk custom in general, with only occasional reference to Hungarian agricul- tural rites and beliefs. The most interesting and instructive parts of the book are the last five chapters. These contain mostly Hungarian material on such subjects as the questions of the migration, bor- rowing, and diffusion of Hungarian agrarian folk customs, and the foreign elements in them. The results of the investigation of foreign elements are summed up by the au- thor: "A certain layer of Hungarian folk belief and folk custom is of foreign origin; it became Hungarian together with the carriers of the tradition" (p. 199; my translation). The last chapter treats the relationship between Hungarian agrarian rites and the European agrarian cult in the context of the history of the Magyar people, their Central Asian origin, and the Slavic influence to which they were exposed once they settled in Hungary. Of special interest is "Conclusion and Tasks" in which the author rather too briefly considers the question of the changes that were brought about in the age-old Hungarian agrarian customs and beliefs by "the transition to a capitalization of agricul- ture and to large-scale, collective cultiva- tion" (p. 233). The author is well qualified to discuss this theme more intensively. While only those parts of the book that deal with Hungarian customs are of interest to students of agrarian folklore outside Hungary, a study by the author (in an English translation) of the traditional Hun- garian agricultural rites and beliefs and the changes they have undergone since the col- lectivization of agriculture as well as the contingent transformation of small land-</page><page sequence="3">398 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [73, 1971 owners into salaried workers, would be a valuable contribution to the English-reading community of folklorists and anthropol- ogists.</page></plain_text>
