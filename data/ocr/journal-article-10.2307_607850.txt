<plain_text><page sequence="1">BULLETIN OF THE SCHOOL OF ORIENTAL STUDIES LONDON INSTITUTION PAPERS CONTRIBUTED Kha and other Words denoting "Zero" in Connection with the Metaphysics of Space By ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY KHA, cf. Greek Xai0, is generally " cavity "; and in the Rg Veda, particularly, " the hole in the nave of a wheel through which the axle runs " (Monier-Williams). In Journ. U.P. Hist. Soc., vii, 44-5 and 62, Mr. A. N. Singh shows conclusively that in Indian mathe- matical usage, current during the earlier centuries of the Christian era, kha means " zero "; S-fryadeva, commenting on Aryabhata, says " the khas refer to voids (khani d snya upa laksitdni) . . . thus khad- vinake means the eighteen places denoted by zeros ". Amongst other words denoting zero are .Siinya, ksa"a, vyoma, antariksa, nabha, naanta, and pitrna.1 We are immediately struck by the fact that the words ffnya" void ", and pftrna " plenum" should have a common reference; the implication being that all numbers are virtually or potentially present in that which is without number; expressing this as an equation, 0 = x - x, it is apparent that zero is to number as possibility 1 It may as well be pointed out here that although " The decimal notation must have been in existence and in common use amongst the mathematicians long before the idea of applying the place-value principle to a system of word names could have been conceived " (Singh, loc. cit., p. 61), and although a decimal scale has actually been found at Mohenjodaro (Mackay, " Further Excavations at Mohenjodaro," Journ. Roy. Soc. Arts, No. 4233, 1934, p. 222), it is by no means the intention of the present article to present an argument for a _Rg Vedic knowledge of either the decimal system or the concept " zero " as such. Our purpose is merely to exhibit the meta- physical and ontological implications of the terms which were later on actually used by Aryabhata and Bhaskara, etc., to designate " zero ", " one ", and some higher numbers. VOL. VII. PART 3. 32</page><page sequence="2">488 ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY- to actuality. Again, employment of the term ananta with the same reference implies an identification of zero with infinity; the beginning of all series being thus the same as their end. This last idea, we may observe, is met with already in the earlier metaphysical literature, for example Rg Veda, iv, 1, 11, where Agni is described as " hiding both his ends " (guhamano anta); Aitareya Br., iii, 43, " the Agnistoma is like a chariot-wheel, endless" (ananta); Jaiminiya Up. Br., i, 35, " the Year is endless (ananta), its two ends (antS) are Winter and Spring . . so is the endless chant " (anantarn saman). These citations suggest that it may be possible to account for the later mathematicians' selec- tion of technical terms by reference to an earlier usage of the same or like terms in a purely metaphysical context. Our intention being to demonstrate the native connection of the mathematical terms kha, etc., with the same terms as employed in purely metaphysical contexts, it will be necessary to prepare the diagram of a circle or cosmic wheel (cakra, mandala) and to point out the significance of the relationships of the parts of such a diagram according to universal tradition and more particularly in accordance with the formulation of the #Rg Veda. Take a piece of blank paper of any dimensions, mark a point anywhere upon it, and with this point as centre draw two concentric circles of any radius, but one much less than the other; draw any radius from the centre to the outer circumference. With exception of the centre, which as point is necessarily without dimension, note that every part of our diagram is merely representative; that is, the number of circles may be indefinitely increased, and the number of radii likewise, each circle thus filled up becoming at last a plane continuum, the extended ground of any given world or state of being; for our purpose we are considering only two such worlds-mythologically speaking, Heaven and Earth, or psychologically, the worlds of subject and object- as forming together the world or cosmos, typical of any particularized world which may be thought of as partial within it. Finally, our diagram may be thought of either as consisting of two concentric circles with their common radii and one common centre, or as the diagram of a wheel, with its felly, nave, spokes, and axle-point. Now in the first place, as a geometrical symbol, that is to say with respect to measure or numeration, our diagram represents the logical relationships of the concepts naught or zero, inconnumerable unity, and indefinite multiplicity; the blank (iinya) surface having no numerical significance; the central point (indu, bindu) being an</page><page sequence="3">KHA AND OTHER WORDS DENOTING " ZERO " 489 inconnumerable unity (inconnumerable, advaita, because there cannot be conceived a second centre); and either circumference an endless (ananta) series of points, which may be thought of as numbers; the totality (sarvam) of the numbered, that is to say individual, points representing the sum of a mathematically infinite series extending from one to " infinity ", and conceivable as plus or minus according to the direction of procedure. The whole area ('arira) delimited corresponds to place (de'a), a revolution of the circles about their centre corresponds to time (kila). It will be observed further that any radius connects analogous or corresponding points or numbers on the two circumferences 1; if now we suppose the radius of one or both circles indefinitely reduced, which brings us to the central point as limiting concept (that is also " as it was in the beginning "), it is evident that even this point can only be thought of as a plenum of all the numbers represented on either circumference.2 On the other hand, this point, at the same time that it represents an inconnumerable unity, and as we have just seen, a plenum, must also be thought of as representing, that is as the symbol of, zero; for two reasons- (1) inasmuch as the concept to which it refers is by definition without place and without dimensions, and therefore non-existent, and (2) the mathematically infinite series, thought of as both plus and minus according to direction, cancel out where all directions meet in common focus. So far as I know, Indian literature does not provide a specific exegesis exactly corresponding to what is given in the preceding paragraph. What we do find in the metaphysical and religious traditions is a corresponding usage of the symbol of the Wheel (primarily the, or a wheel of the, solar chariot), and it is in this connection that we first meet with some of the most significant of those terms which are later on employed by the mathematicians. In Rg Veda i, 155, 6; i, 164, 2, 11, 13, 14, and 48; Atharva Veda, x, 8, 4-7; Kaus7taki Br., xx, 1 ; Jaiminiya Up. Br., i, 35; Brhaddranyaka Up., i, 5, 15 ; Svetdivatara Up., i, 4; Praina Up., vi, 5-6; and like texts, the Year as an ever- lasting sequence is thought of as an unwasting wheel of life, a revolving wheel of the Angels, in which all things have their being and are manifested in succession; " none of its spokes is last in order ", Rg Veda, v, 85, 5. The parts of the wheel are named as follows: amni, 1 The familiar principle " as above, so below " is illustrated here. 2 The notion of exemplarism is expressed here, with respect to number or mathe- matical individuality.</page><page sequence="4">490 ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY- the axle-point within the nave (note that the axle causes revolution, but does not itself revolve); kha, nabhi, the nave (usually as space within the hub, occasionally as the hub itself) ; ara, spoke, connecting hub and felly; nemi, pavi, the felly. It should be observed that ndbhi, from root nabh, to expand, is also " navel"; similarly in anthropomorphic formulation, " navel" corresponds to " space " (Maitri Up., vi, 6); in ?Rg Veda, the cosmos is constantly thought of as "expanded " (root pin) from this chthonic centre. Certain passages indicating the metaphysical significance of the terms 5ni, kha, and nabhi in the Rg Veda may now be cited. It should be premised that we find here in connection with the constant use of the wheel symbol, and absence of a purely geometrical formulation, the term ani employed to express ideas later on referred to by the words indu or bindu.1 Vedic dni, being the axle-point within the nave of the wheel, and on which the wheel revolves, corresponds exactly to Dante's il punto dello stelo al cui la prima rota va dintorno, Paradiso, xiii, 11-12. The metaphysical significance of the 5ni is fully brought out in Rg Veda, i, 35, 6 aniTh na rathyam amrta adhi tasthuh, " as on the axle-point of the chariot-wheel are actually-existent the undying (Angels or intellectual principles)"; which also supplies the answer to the well-known problem, " How many Angels can stand on the point of a needle ? " More often the nave of the wheel, rather than the axle-point specifically, is treated as its centre; nor need this confuse us if we reflect that just as under limiting conditions (indefinite reduc- tion of the radius, or when the central point has been identified but the circle not yet drawn) the centre represents the circle, so under similar conditions (metaphysically in principio) the axle-point implies the nave or even the whole wheel-the point without dimension, and a principal space not yet expanded (or as the Rg Veda would express it, "closed ") being the same in reference. The nave then, kha or nabhi of the world wheel is regarded as the receptable and fountain of all order, formative ideas, and goods : for example, ii, 28, 5, rdhydma te varuna kham rtasya " may we, 0 Varun.a, win thy nave of Law "; viii, 41, 6, where in Trita IAptya " all oracles (kivya) are set as is the nave within the wheel " (cakre nabhir iva); iv, 28, where Indra 1 Indu occurs in the BRg Veda as." drop " in connection with Soma; in Atharva Veda, vii, 109, 6, as " point on a die "; and grammatically as the designation of Anusvdra. PaficaviIiha Brahmatna, vi, 9, 19-20 is of interest; indava iva hi pitara4 mana iva, i.e. " the Patriarchs are as it were drops (indu in pl.), as it were the intellectual principle ". In Rg Veda, vi, 44, 22, Indu is evidently Soma ; in vii, 54, 2, Vistogpati.</page><page sequence="5">KHA AND OTHER WORDS DENOTING " ZERO " 491 opens the closed or hidden naves or rocks (apihiti ... khMni in verse 1, apihitdni asna in verse 5) and thus releases the Seven Rivers of Life.' In v, 32, 1, where Indra breaks open the Fountain of Life (utsam) this is again an emptying out of the hollows (khani), whereby the fettered floods are released. According to an alternative formulation, all things are thought of as ante principium shut up within, and in principio as proceeding from, a common ground, rock, or mountain (budhna, adri, parvata, etc.): this ground, thought of as resting island-like within the undifferentiated .sea of universal possibility (x, 89, 4, where the waters pour sagarasya budhnat), is merely another aspect of our axle-point (dni), regarded as the primary assumption toward which the whole potentiality of existence is focussed by the primary acts of intellection and will. This means that a priori undimensioned space (kha, Jkia'a, etc.) rather underlies and is the mother of the point, than that the latter has an independent origin; and this accords with the logical order of thought, which proceeds from potentiality to actuality, non-being to being. This ground or point is in fact the " rock of ages " (a~imany anante, i, 130, 3; adrim acyutam, vi, 17, 5). Here ante principium Agni lies occulted (guhJ santam, i, 141, 3, etc.) as Ahi Budhnya, "in the ground of space, concealing both his ends " (budhne rajaso . . . guhamino anta, iv, 1, 11, where it may be noted that guhamino anti is tantamount to ananta, literally " end-less ", " in-finite," " eternal "), and hence he is called " chthonic " (ndbhir agni prthivya, i, 59, 2, etc.), and first born in this ground (jaiyata prathamahl ... budhne, iv, 1, 11), he stands erect, Janus-like, at the parting of the ways (ayor ha skambha ... pathdai visarqe, x, 5, 6); hence he gets his chthonic steeds and other treasures (advabudhna, x, 8, 3; budhnyd vasTini, vii, 6, 7). It is only when this rock is cleft that the hidden kine are freed, the waters flow (i, 62, 3, where Brhaspati bhinad adrim and vidad gdh ; v, 41, 12, s.rnvantv ipah ... adreh). This is, moreover, a centre without place, and hence when the Waters have come forth, that is when the cosmos 1 The Rivers, of course, represent ensembles of possibility (hence they are often spoken of as " maternal ") with respect to a like number of " worlds ", or planes of being, as in i, 22, 16 prthivyd sapta dhamabhih. Our terms kha, a'na, etc., are necessarily employed in the plural when the " creation " is envisaged with respect to the cosmos not as a single " world ", but as composed of two, three, or seven originally unmani- fested but now to be conceptually distinguished " worlds "; the solar chariot having one, two, three, or seven wheels accordingly. It is perhaps because the chariot of, the Year is more often than not thought of as two-wheeled (Heaven and Earth) and therefore provided with two analogous axle-points that dni was not later employed as a verbal symbol of " one ".</page><page sequence="6">492 ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY- has come to be, one asks as in x, 111, 8, " where is their beginning (agram), where their ground (budhnah), where now, ye Waters, your innermost centre ? " (madhyam . . . antah).1 Thus metaphysically, in the symbolism of the Wheel, the surface -blank (gSnya) in the initial non-being (asat) of any formulation (saiih- kalpa)-represents the truly infinite (aditi) and maternal possibility of being; the axle-point or nave, exemplary being (virvam ekam, 4Rg Veda, iii, 54, 8 = integral omnipresence) ; the actual construction, a mentally accomplished partition of being into existences; each spoke, the integration of an individual as ndma-rilpa, that is as archetypal inwardly and phenomenal outwardly; the felly, the principle of multiplicity (visamatva). Or employing a more theological terminology: the undetermined surface represents the Godhead (aditi, parabrahman, tamas, apah); the axle-point or immovable rock, God (ditya, aparabrahman, vara, jyoti); the circle of the nave, Heaven (svarga); any point on the circumference of the nave, an intellectual principle (ndma, deva); the felly, Earth with its analogous (anuripa) phenomena (vi'vd ripdni); the construction of the wheel, the sacrificial act of creation (karma,2 srsti), its abstraction the act of dissolution (laya). Furthermore, the course (gati) of any individual upon the pathway of a spoke is in the beginning centrifugal (pravyrtta) and then again centripetal (nivrtta), until the centre (madhya) is found ; and when the centre of individual being coincides with the centre of the wheel, he is emancipate (mukta), the extension of the wheel no longer involving him in local motion, at the same time that its entire circuit now becomes for him one picture (jagaccitra) 3 seen in simul- taneity, who as " round-about-seer ", paridrast.r, now " overlooks everything ", vi'vam abhicaste, i, 164, 44. In order to understand the use of terms for " space " (kha, dksAa, antariksa, .snya, etc.) 4 as verbal symbols of zero (which represents privation of number, and is yet a matrix of number in the sense 1 Madhya is " middle " in all senses, and also algebraically " mean ". For the metaphysical values, cf. in the Rg Veda madhye samudre and utsasya madhye = sindh- u~nam upodaye as the place of Agni or Varunia and in Chandogya Up., iii, 11, 1 ekata madhye sthdne " single in the midmost station ". 2 For the construction of the wheel, cf. ?gT Veda, viii, 77, 3, akhidat khe ardai iva khedayd and discussion in my Angel and Titan, an essay in Vedic ontology, to appear in the JAOS. 1934. S3 afikaricarya, Svdtmaniriipan.a, 95. 4 iinya does not appear in the Rg Veda, though i~inam occurs in the sense of " privation ".</page><page sequence="7">KHA AND OTHER WORDS DENOTING "ZERO " 493 0 = x - x),' it must be realized that 5kdsa, etc., represent primarily a concept not of physical space, but of a purely principial space without dimension, though the matrix of dimension.2 For example, " all these beings arise out of the space (akaSid samapadyanta) and return into the space (akadam pratyastam yanti). For the space is older than they, and is their last resort (pardyanam)," Chdndogya Up.,.i, 9, 1; " space is the name of the permissive cause of individual-integration," akdso vai ndma namaraipayor nirvahitS, Chdndogya Up., viii, 14; and just as Indra " opens the closed spaces ", apihita khani, #Rg Veda, iv, 28, 1, so the Self " awakens this rational (cosmos) from that space ", akadat esa khalu ida4m cetamatram bodhayati, Maitri Up., vi, 17, in other words ex nihilo fit. Furthermore, the locus of this " space " is " within you ": " what is the intrinsic aspect of extension is the supernal fiery energy in the vacance of the inner man ", tat svarapamh nabhasah khe antarbhitasya yat pararh tejah, Maitri Up., vii, 11 3; and this same " space in the heart " (antarh.rdaya akada) is the locus (Syatana, vesma, nfSda, ko a, etc.) where are deposited in secret (guha nihitam) all that is ours already or may be ours on any plane (loka) of experience (Chandogya Up., viii, 1, 1-3). At the same time, Brhaddranyaka Up., v, 1, this " ancient space " (kha) is identified with Brahman and with the Spirit (kham brahma, kham purdnam, vdyuram kham iti), and this Brahman is at the same time a plenum or pleroma (ptrnpa) such that " when plenum is taken from plenum, plenum yet remains ".4 Here we get precisely that equivalence of kha and pilrna, void and plenum, which was remarked upon as noteworthy in the verbal notation of the mathematicians. The thought, moreover, is almost literally repeated when Bhaskara in the BMjaganita (ed. Calcutta, 1917, pp. 17-18) defines the term ananta thus, ayam ananto rJgih, khahara ity ucyate. Asmin vikdrah khahare na rasavapi pravistesvapi nihsrtesu bahusvapi syda layasrstikile 'nante 'cyute bhfttaganesu yadvat, that is " This fraction of which the denominator is zero, is called an infinite quantity.

COOMARASWAMY- no alteration, though many be added or subtracted; just as there is no alteration in the Infinite Immovable (anante acyute) 1 at the time of the emanation or resolution of worlds, though hosts of beings are emanated or withdrawn ". It may be observed further that while in the Rg Veda we " do not find the use of names of things to denote numbers, we do find instances of numbers denoting things" (Singh, loc. cit., p. 56). In vii, 103, 1, for example, the number " twelve " denotes the " year"; in x, 71, 3, " seven " stands for " rivers of life " or " states of being " It is thus merely a converse usage of words when the mathematicians make use of the names of things to denote numbers; to take the most obvious examples, it is just what should be expected, when we find that one is expressed by such words as ddi, indu, abja, prthv ; two by such as yama, a'vind; three by such as agni, vaisvanara, haranetra, bhuvana ; four by veda, dig, yuga, samudra, etc.; five by prdna; six by rtu; and so forth. It is not to be understood, of course, that the number-words are all of Vedic origin; many suggest rather an epic vocabulary, e.g. pandava for five, while others, such as netra for two have an obvious and secular source. In certain cases an ambiguity arises, for example loka as representing either three or fourteen, did as representing four or ten, but this can be readily under- stood; in the last-mentioned case for example, the quarters have been thought of in one and the same cosmology as either four, or if we count up eight quarters and half-quarters, adding the zenith and nadir, as ten. Taken in its entirety as cited by Singh, the numerical vocabulary can hardly antedate the beginning of the Christian era (we find that ten is represented amongst other words by avatara; six by riga). If we attempt to account for the forms of the ideograms of numbers in a similar fashion, we shall be on much less certain ground. A few suggestions may nevertheless be made. For example, a picture writing of the notion " axle-point " could only have been a " point ", and of the concept "nave " could only have been a "round 0 ", and both of these signs are employed at the present day to indicate zero. The upright line that represents " one " may be regarded as a pictogram of the axis that penetrates the naves of the dual wheels, and thus at once unites and separates Heaven and Earth. The Devanagari and Arabic signs for three correspond to the trident (trisiila) which 1 Cf. ahmany anante and adrim acyutam cited above with the meaning " rock of Ages ".</page><page sequence="9">KHA AND OTHER WORDS DENOTING " ZERO " 495 is known to have been from very ancient times an Agni or giva. A priori it might be expected that a sign for " four " should be cruci- form following the notion of extension in the directions of the four airts (di') ; and we find in fact in Saka script that " four " is represented by a sign X, and that the Devanhgari may well be thought of as a cursive form derived from a like prototype. Even if there be sufficient foundation for such suggestions, it is hardly likely that a detailed interpretation of ideograms of numbers above four could now be deduced. We can only say that the foregoing suggestions as to the nature of numerical ideograms rather support than counter the views of those who seek to derive the origins of symbolism, script, and speech from the concept of the circuit of the Year. It is, however, beyond question that many of the verbal symbols -the case of kha for " zero " is conspicuous-used by Indian mathe- maticians had an earlier currency, that is to say before a development of mathematical science as such, in a more universal, metaphysical context. That a scientific terminology should thus have been formu- lated on the basis of a metaphysical terminology, and by no means without a full consciousness of what was being done (as the citation from Bhaskara clearly shows), is not only in accordance with all that we know of the natural course of Indian thought, which takes the universal for granted and proceeds to the particular, but also admirably illustrates what from a traditionally orthodox point of view would be regarded as constituting a natural and right relationship of any special science to the metaphysical background of all sciences. One is reminded of words in the Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII, dated in 1879, on the Restoration of Christian Philosophy, as follows: "Hence, also, the physical sciences, which now are held in so much repute, and everywhere draw to themselves a singular admiration, because of the wonderful discoveries made in them, would not only take no harm from a restoration of the philosophy of the ancients, but would derive great protection from it. For the fruitful exercise and increase of these sciences it is not enough that we consider facts and contemplate Nature. When the facts are well known we must rise higher, and give our thoughts with great care to understanding the nature of corporeal things, as well as to the investigation of the laws which they obey, and of the principles from which spring their order, their unity in variety, and their common likeness in diversity. It is marvellous what power and light and help are given to these investigations by Scholastic philosophy, if it be wisely used . . . there</page><page sequence="10">496 ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY- is no contradiction, truly so called, between the certain and proved conclusions of recent physics, and the philosophical principles of the Schools." These words by no means represent a merely Christian apologetic, but rather enunciate a generally valid procedure, in which the theory of the universal acts at the same time with suggestive force and normatively with respect to more specific applications. We may reflect on the one hand that the decimal system, with which the concept of " zero " is inseparably connected, there in India was developed 1 by scholars who were very surely, as their own words prove, deeply versed in and dependent upon an older and traditional metaphysical interpretation of the meaning of the world; and on the other, that had it not been for its boasted and long-maintained independence of traditional metaphysics (in which the principles, if not the facts of relativity are explicit)2 modern scientific thought might have reached much sooner than has actually been the case a scientifically valid formulation and proof of such characteristic notions as those of an expanding universe and the finity of physical space. What has been outlined above with respect to the special science of mathematics represents a principle no less valid in the case of the arts, as could easily be demonstrated at very great length. For example, what is implied by the statement in Aitareya Brahmana, vi, 27, that " it is in imitation of the angelic works of art that any work of art such as a garment or chariot is made here " 3 is actually to be seen in the hieratic arts of every traditional culture, and in the characteristic motifs of the surviving folk-arts everywhere. Or in the case of literature: epic (Volsunga Saga, Beowulf, the Cuchullain and Arthurian cycles, Mahabharata, Buddhacarita, etc.) and fairy-tale (notably for example, Jack and the Beanstalk) repeat with infinitely varied local colouring the one story of jitavidyi, Genesis.4 The whole 1 " The place system of the Babylonians... fell on fertile soil only among the Hindus... algebra, which is distinctly Hindu... uses the principle of local value " (M. J. Babb, in JAOS., vol. 51, p. 52). That the " Arabic " numerals are ultimately of Indian origin is now generally admitted; what their adoption meant for the development of European science need not be emphasized. 2 Cf. Aryabhata, Aryabhatfiya, iv, 9, " As a man in a boat going forward sees a stationary object moving backward, just so at Lafikd a man sees the stationary asterisms moving backward." 3 See my Transformation of Nature in Art, 1934, p. 8 and note 8. 4 Cf.
