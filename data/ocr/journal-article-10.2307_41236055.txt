The M.I.T. Press: Cambridge, MA. 1985. Doren Recker Johns Hopkins University Just what is sociobiology? Most of us probably think of something like the following: "[Sociobiology is] ... a new and controversial theory of human behavior (which) . . . says that all human actions, even those that appear altruistic, are competitive and selfish, and are programmed into the human genes" {Business Week, 4/10/78, p. 100). That this would be controversial should hardly be surprising. The operative terms and phrases are, of course, 'human,' 'selfish,' and 'programmed into the genes.' These make sociobiology interesting to almost everyone, and have brought publicity to what otherwise would have been debated only by professionals. More official pronouncements by avowed sociobiologists, however, prove to be more slippery. Despite provocative titles such as Human Decency is Animal (Wilson, 1975a), or passages such as "Courtship is an elaborate exercise whereby men seek to deceive women and women subject men to subtle and multiple tests to detect deception. The object of the game is to form a reproductively successful pair-bond" (van den Berghe, 1979, p. 46), there is considerable waffling among the acknowledged leaders over just those issues which make the Business Week characterization explosive. That is: (1) sociobiology is not restricted by these authors to human behavior; (2) terms such as 'selfish' are often either used as technical terms (allegedly without their usual value connotations) or explained away as convenient shorthand expressions; and (3) the nature and degree of genetic programming to which they are committed is variable and fuzzy1. Worse, the bulk of sociobiological research does not concern (or at least does not stress) the behavior of Homo Sapiens.2 All of this illustrates how difficult it is to even characterize sociobiology properly, and leads to doubts concerning whether my original question ("What is sociobiology?") is well-formed.3 In fact, there is no such thing as sociobiology if this is (reasonably) taken to be a unified research program, or even to mark a shared allegiance to a small number of theoretical commitments and research goals. I will call this slipperiness of sociobiology the 'first problem'confronting attempts to analyze or criticize it. The 'second problem' is almost the direct complement of the first, since it also turns out to be problematical to handle the first problem by simply making enough distinctions within sociobiology to make the methodological debates more tractable. While it is necessary, for example, to separate research devoted to human and to (non-human) animal behavior in order to focus upon the scientific status of sociobiology, it can also be misleading. It is true that the explosive aspects mentioned earlier have been overplayed and applied indiscriminately to a wide range of research activities. On the other hand, part of the reason for this unbalanced concentration on moral issues4 is that there is a lot at stake. 69</page><page sequence="2">RECKER Many of us hope, for example, that more enlightened educational and social programs can gradually help to alleviate the plight of numerous groups who have been kept from fully participating in our social and political systems. If the explosive elements within the Business Week definition of sociobiology are well-founded, however, these hopes seem to be at least partly chimerical (since these elements imply biological constraints on human social behavior). Numerous authors have argued that the mantle of 'science' often plays a justificatory role for the dominant political ideology, and that there is a danger that 'biologizing' human social behavior is tantamount to baptizing existing social relations as 'natural' (and hence unchangeable - Bleier 1985; Reed 1975; Lewontin, Rose and Kamin 1984; pp. 236-239). There is, then, a possible tension between the dry analytic care and close methodological scrutiny demanded by the Tirst problem', and the sensitivity to (perhaps hidden) moral and political implications demanded by the second. A delicate balance is needed between assessing the scientific merits of various research programs within sociobiology and appreciating the reasons behind the common emphasis on controversies surrounding human behavior. The 'third problem' is that there are also controversies concerning methodological standards for assessing the scientific status of sociobiology. Worse, these arise at (for present purposes) two levels. First (at what I will call the 'narrow' level, roughly corresponding to the concerns in methodological texts within a field), there are differences between scientific disciplines in terms of the appropriate types of testing procedures available and the rigor of such tests. Second (at what I call the 'structural' level, corresponding to the usual concerns of philosophers of science), there are the familiar debates concerning models of the structure of scientific theories, scientific theory testing, scientific explanation, etc. Worse, investigations carried out at these two different levels need not produce the same verdict concerning the legitimacy of a particular research program. That is, a particular research program may turn out to be 'scientific' structurally (according to one's favorite model of the structure of scientific theories), but fail to measure up to the narrow methodological standards of appropriate neighboring fields, so that its particular claims are not as well supported as they should be (or as claims within research programs with similar narrow methodological machinery are). I have taken the time to outline these general problems with interpreting sociobiology for two reasons. First, I think that they are largely responsible for the apparent intractability of the sociobiology debates. Second, I intend to use these three general problems to structure the following critical review of Philip Kitcher's Vaulting Ambition (Kitcher, 1985b). The first section will address Kitcher's treatment of the 'first problem' (and part of the third), stressing his careful analysis of sociobiology, and his narrow methodological critique of various types of 'human' sociobiology. The second section will briefly consider his treatment of the 'second problem,' and then turn to his structural methodological position. It will be seen that I am largely sympathetic to Kitcher's approach and to his general conclusions. In fact, I think that Vaulting Ambition is the best contribution yet made to the sociobiology debates. What hesitations I do have are more indicative of the need for further elaboration within the general framework Kitcher provides, than of a need for a different framework. THE ROAD TO 'POP SOCIOBIOLOGY' As far as I'm concerned, the first four chapters of Vaulting Ambition solve the 'first problem.' The more familiar controversial claims in sociobiology are clearly separated from both research programs devoted to providing evolutionary explanations for animal 70</page><page sequence="3">A REVIEW OF KITCHER behavior, and from a possible future research program that will be able to legitimately extend such explanations to human behavior. What is left is called 'pop sociobiology, 'and is itself separated into three distinct 'brands:' (1) the 'early Wilsonian program;' (2) the 'later Wilsonian program;' and (3) [what I will call] the 'phenotype-environment' program (ch. I).5 Such distinctions help to lessen the slipperiness of sociobiology, and to focus on particular claims of different research programs within a general family of theoretical models and research goals. The first four chapters also help to focus on the methodological issues involved in assessing the scientific status of pop sociobiology. First, the structural and narrow methodological aspects of general evolutionary theory are outlined (ch. 2). Then, the most familiar models employed by all sociobiologists are introduced and explained (namely, "inclusive fitness," "game theoretical," "optimality," and "reciprocal altruism" models - ch. 3). Finally, the question "What is pop sociobiology?" is addressed within the context established by the preceding analysis (ch. 4). That is, the reader is prepared for the ensuing (narrow) methodological critique of pop sociobiology (chs. 5-10) because the proper distinctions have been made within sociobiology to distinguish different research programs, and because the proper context has been provided with which to compare the (narrow) methodological status of pop sociobiology. The culmination of Kitcher's clarification of pop sociobiology is his analysis of the argument structure of early Wilsonian program, which he calls 'Wilson's ladder' (pp. 126- 27).6 This is a particularly important contribution to the sociobiological debates because the arguments for pop sociobiology are even more slippery than the characterizations alluded to above. It looks like the main type of support for pop sociobiology is its alleged explanatory power, since the more controversial claims about human behavior are almost invariably surrounded by example after example from animal sociobiology (that is, a type of explanation is claimed to be consistent with numerous examples of animal behavior, and then the same type of explanation is given for human behavior).7 In fact, as Kitcher shows, a number of particular steps are necessary to get from evolutionary explanations of animal behavior (good or bad) to explanations of human behavior, and delineating these steps helps to focus the narrow methodological issues and to separate pop sociobiology from more promising animal research.8 There are four 'rungs' in Wilson's ladder: (1) the claim that a particular group of animals A would maximize their fitness by engaging in a particular type of behavior В within their natural environment; (2) the claim that if behavior В is common among the members of group A, it is common because it has been favored by natural selection; (3) the claim that, since natural selection operates on genetic differences, there must be some genetic basis for behavior B; and (4) since behavior В is both genetically based and has been formed by natural selection, it would be difficult to change this behavior without incurring (largely unknown) 'costs' (pp. 126-127). To get to humans, simply include them as one of the species in group A (for example, A might be the group of mammals, carnivores, primates, etc. depending on the particular behavior in question). One of the narrow methodological points made by Kitcher is that it is necessary to consider and attempt to eliminate rival explanations when trying to support a particular evolutionary explanation. The kinds of causal inferences involved are often such that the alleged independent variables cannot be directly manipulated and subjected to randomization via experimental design. Hence, the narrow methodological problems involved are more akin to those in the social sciences than to experimental physics (for example, Blalock (1964 [1961]), chs. 1 and 2), and confirmation for such explanations must 71</page><page sequence="4">RECKER include eliminating possible rivals.9 As Kitcher points out, failure to do so does not (by itself) eliminate the scientific merits of a proposed explanation (pp. 70-72), but it should certainly lead to caution, and should foster a less robust epistemic attitude than belief.10 The main strategy behind Kitcher's narrow methodological critque of pop socibiology, however, is to dismantle Wilson's ladder rung by rung (chs. 5-10). It is in this section that the fruits of having first focused the methodological issues and provided a basis for comparison are particularly obvious. Consider the first rung. What would be needed to support the claim that a certain type of behavior would be adaptive for a group of animals within a certain environment? For one thing, the behavior in question would need to be clearly defined, and (for another) at least some details concerning the cost/ benefit analysis which led to the conclusion that the behavior was adaptive need to be provided. Pop sociobiologists, on the contrary, consistently engage in 'casual' optimality calculations, which neither clearly demarcate the behavior nor provide sufficient details to accurately determine whether it even is adaptive (pp. 160, 163-165, 176-181). What about rung two? What is needed is a careful analysis of the behavior in question (to determine that it is common in the group, and that it can be reasonably considered to be one type of behavior), and evidence that it is common because it has been 'selected for.' Pop sociobiological generalizations are very loose (for example, 'aggressive behavior5) and/ or so anthropomorphic that it is no surprise that what has been (with or without scare quotes) ascribed to animals is then found to apply to humans too! (examples: 'adultery,' 'incest,' 'homosexuality/'rape'). [pp. 159, 184-190; Leacock, 1980, pp. 466-469,480; Rose, 1980, p. 165; Estepand Bruce, 1981, pp. 1272-1273] Further, pop sociobiologists tend to assume that if the behavior ('carved out' as above) is common, this is because it was selected for, ignoring (among other things) other evolutionary forces besides natural selection (pp. 218-226; Lewontin 1979, pp. 341-343, 346-347, Gould and Lewontin, 1979), and the important distinction between a trait's simply being selected and being selected because of some conferred advantage (selection of I selection for - pp. 233-237; Sober, 1984, pp. 97-102). Rung three is also rotten. It depends on at least two problematic assumptions: (l)that a genetic basis is necessary for a trait to be selected; and (2) that shared traits imply some shared genetic basis. The first assumption is thwarted when it is remembered that a behavior can also spread through a population via imitation or learning (and not only in humans - pp. 204-205; Etkin, 1981, pp. 60-67; Gould 1977a, p. 256; Breuer, 1982, pp. 229-230). The second is threatened when it is remembered that similar organs (or behaviors) within different groups of animals can be the result of common descent (homologous) or represent similar responses to similar environmental challenges (analogous). This means that, once again, one must be wary of assumptions that when a group of animals share a trait, it has arisen in all of them through the same evolutionary mechanisms, [pp. 157-158, 242; Gould 1977a, p. 254, Etkin 1981, pp. 68-70; Leacock, 1980, pp. 467-468- but, see Barash (1982, [1977]), pp. 149- 150, 156]. Finally, rung four cracks under the weight of the assumption that selection (plus a genetic basis) implies that changing the environment will not be sufficient to change the behavior in question. Even i/ the first three rungs were mended, how does one (at present) separate the effects of the environment and the genetic basis to determine their relative causal efficacy (pp. 206-212; Lewontin 1974, pp. 138-144; 1979 pp. 341-343)? Pop sociobioloigists typically try to do so by separating cross-cultural traits from those which are relatively unique to one or a few cultures (on the assumption that 'universal biologically based' - Wilson 1978, pp. 125-128, 132-142, 147-148; van den Berghe 1979, pp. 51-60, 70-74), orby 72</page><page sequence="5">A REVIEW OF KITCHER using results gleaned from twin-studies, etc., that are assumed to separate biological from environmental effects (Lumsden and Wilson 1981, pp. 16ff; Wilson 1978 pp.45-46; Barash (1982[1977]), pp. 158-60). Of course, both types of 'controls' assume that the cited cases represent sufficient environmental diversity so that the environment can be considered to have been randomized, leaving our biology as the apparent unchanging independent variable! (Barash, (1982[1977]), p. 150). Given the problems with classifying 'similar' behavior, and the general lack of concern in pop sociobiology with eliminating rival hypotheses (in this case that the environments are similar enough to contribute to the behavior in a unified way), this assumption is also quite problematical, [pp. 208-211, 246- 249; Defries 1980, pp. 288-290; Bleier 1985, pp. 27-30; Ortner 1974, pp. 69-73; Lewontin, Rose and Kamin 1984, pp. 106-118] This quick tour through some of Kitcher's narrow methodological critique of pop sociobiology is by no means exhaustive, and cannot replace the impression of thoroughness resulting from reading chapters five through ten. Part of the punch of these chapters is due, no doubt, to the Kitcheresque clarity and wit with which they are presented. It also helps to bring a number of different types of objections together in one place. I think, however, that their persuasiveness primarily comes from Kitcher's having first systematically and clearly delineated pop sociobiology as one type of sociobiology, laid down the proper methodological context in which to evaluate the scientific status, isolated Wilson's ladder as the characteristic argument structure implicit in most pop sociobiological treatises, and focused the methodological objections on assumption within this argument structure. That is, Kitcher's narrow methodological critique is exemplary (partially) because of the way he handles the 'first problem.' GETTING 'THERE' FROM 'HERE' There are two chapters in Vaulting Ambition which are predominantly devoted to the 'second problem', the introductory chapter and chapter eleven. The latter exposes the simplemindedness of pop sociobiology's quick treatment of questions surrounding altruism, freedom, and human nature when compared with the complexity of these issues within recent philosophical analyses. To give a quick example, sociobiologists typically do not appreciate the subtleties involved in even characterizing the free will/ determinism issue. One finds Wilson, for example, identifying freedom with unpredictability (Wilson, 1978, pp. 71- 77), which (clearly) does not address the complexities which have interested philosophers (pp. 406-417). In these value areas, however, pop sociobiologists have been particularly vulnerable, even for those who are more sympathetic than Kitcher to the potential of their program (examples: Rosenberg 1986, p. 608; Ruse 1981, pp. 215-217). The introductory chapter of Vaulting Ambition is particularly interesting and well written, and displays in a brief but poignant manner what bothers most critics of sociobiology (and perhaps why the moral issues have been over emphasized in the secondary literature). Kitcher uses an example of a well-intentioned intrusion of science into social and political policy: the effects of 'general intelligence tests't on the educational and career aspirations of untold numbers of lower and middle class children and their families. As is well known, the 'science' behind these policies turned out to be questionable in the best cases, and fraudulent in the worst (pp. 2-3; Lewontin, Kamin, and Rose 1984, pp. 90-106; Gould, 73</page><page sequence="6">RECKER 1981, pp. 234-320). For many critics the moral of this and similar cases is that we should suspect any intrusion of allegedly objective scientific perspectives into issues concerning human nature and human aspirations. Roughly, the legacy of social Darwinism, craniology, I.Q. tests, etc., exposes and helps to debunk the ideology behind pop sociobiology (taken as just another attempt to reify and control human behavior in the name of science). [Alper, Beckwith, and Miller 1978, pp. 485-486; Allen et al. 1975, pp. 259-260; Lewontin, Kamin and Rose 1984, pp. 265 ff., Bleier 1985, pp. 19-27; Shields 1980, pp. 490-499] Kitcher's moral, however, is (while sympathetic to such worries) more balanced. Because the stakes are so high when science intrudes on public policy, we need to be especially methodologically rigorous in determining whether we should accept the alleged evidence. "When scientific claims bear on matters of social policy, the standards of evidence and of self-criticisms must be extremely high" (p. 3). There are two dangers that need to be avoided in such cases. On the one hand (Charybdis), thoughtful social reformers need to be careful not to become obscurantists in their zeal to debunk 'objective' approaches to social policy ("One does not help the oppressed by indulging in fantasies about their capacities" - p. 7). On the other hand (Scylla), the critics may be right in emphasizing the (often hidden) ideological components within scientific practice that can be so costly precisely because of the prestige of 'objective science' (pp. 3-4). Hence, while the bulk of Vaulting Ambition is devoted to addressing the methodology behind the more controversial pop sociobiological claims (to avoid Charybdis), Kitcher does not forget the consequences in terms of human aspirations if these claims are accepted because of a superficial similarity to science (to avoid Scylla). "If the costs of being wrong are sufficiently high, then it is reasonable and responsible to ask for more evidence than is demanded in situations where mistakes are relatively innocuous" (p. 9). That is, Kitcher's stress on methodological issues serves both purposes, and, for my money, this approach provides just the sort of balance needed to navigate between the two dangers listed. So, I think that Kitcher also solves the 'second problem'. Let's briefly take stock. First, it was claimed that if the various types of sociobiology aren't delineated, one becomes lost in claims and counterclaims that prove to be peripheral to the real issues involved. If an attack is launched against the alleged lack of falsifiable predictions concerning human behavior, for example, careful studies of animal behavior can be cited that (while not conclusive) are at least suggestive of the possibility of applying evolutionary analyses to behavior (and, since human beings are animals, . . . - van den Berghe 1979, pp. 4-7; Barash(1982[1977]), pp. 1-6, 143-162). As shown in the first section of this paper, Kitcher's careful analyses in the first four chapters of Vaulting Ambition focus on the (narrow) methodological issues, and allow us to determine the differences between 'good' sociobiological research and pop sociobiology (which attempts to ride the coattails of more careful work). Second, it was claimed that having once separated animal from human sociobiology, it is still necessary to keep the human dimension particularly in mind, because of the importance of the issues involved. I have just shown how Kitcher handles this need for balance. What is left? Hasn't the scientific status of pop sociobiology been exposed as chimerical in the narrow methodological critique in chapters five through ten? If so, there are no reasons to believe the controversial claims of pop sociobiology, and there should no longer be any temptation to confuse Wilson's ladder with legitimate inferences made within more restricted domains. Doesn't this mean that the work is over, and that "premature speculations about human nature may ht jettisoned" (p. ix, emphasis added)? 74</page><page sequence="7">A REVIEW OF KITCHER Well, in so far as pop sociobiology just is a broken-backed (methodologically) attempt to ground premature speculations concerning human behavior, I suppose so. On the other hand, there may be more to the program of pop sociobiology than attempts to ascend Wilson's ladder. Indeed, it is largely because the pop sociobiological literature is filled with models of behavior that have proven successful in more restricted domains (ch. 3), and because it looks like a subdiscipline of general evolutionary theory, that pop sociobiology has proven to be so resilient. This is also why (I think) a number of philosophers of science, supporting different structural models of scientific theories, have been more sympathetic to the program of pop sociobiology, while often agreeing with at least some of Kitcher's (narrow) methodological critique.1 1 That is, when the scientific status of a research program is extended beyond the question of whether its particular claims are well confirmed to broader questions concerning it scientific promise (which is often explicitly appealed to by pop sociobiologists- for example, Barash (1982[1977]), pp. 57-59), it is no longer clear that a narrow methodological analysis is appropriate. Without trying to unpack here all that might be contained in the umbrella concept of 'scientific promise', surely part of the notion involves assessing whether a research program will prove fruitful, and this involves broader (structural) concerns about continuity and discontinuity within theory development. What type of structural model underlies Kitcher's critique of pop sociobiology? Kitcher's structural model for general evolutionary theory is outlined in chapter two of Vaulting Ambition (pp. 54-58; Kitcher 1982a, pp. 45-54; 1985a, pp. 132-148).12 Darwinian Evolution is here taken to be a "collection of problem solving patterns," consisting of (1) a collection of evolutionary questions; (2) strategies for addressing these questions ("Darwinian Histories"); and (3) some general views about the evolutionary process (which act largely as constraints on possible Darwinian histories- pp. 54 ff.). Darwinian histories consist of stories which trace (often only in outline form) successive modifications of groups of organisms. They are called 'minimal' (or 'cautious*) Darwinian histories if they eschew speculations concerning the causes of evolutionary change, and 'ambitious' Darwinian histories if they include such speculations (pp. 56-57). Again, particular ambitious Darwinian histories are confirmed by eliminating possible rivals. Obviously, all of sociobiology (since it attempts to provide evolutionary explanations of behavior) proceeds by means of postulating and attempting to confirm ambitious Darwinian histories. Hence, the structure of sociobiology (including pop sociobiology) is, for Kitcher (as it is for Ruse, Thompson, and Hull- see note 11), simply the structure of (ambitious) general evolutionary theory (pp. 117-119, 121). Further, as Kitcher claims, most of his methodological complaints are concerned with "local issues," or with whether pop sociobiologists "instantiate their preferred patterns of explanations" (p. 119, emphasis added). Thus, for Kitcher, the structure of pop sociobiology needs to be separated from the questions of whether particular claims are well confirmed, or whether particular inferences are sound. We already know where he stands concerning the latter (narrow) issues, what about the scientific promise of pop sociobiology? This question is more difficult to answer for three reasons. First, Kitcher (in the context of animal studies) insists that there is a large middle ground between complete scientific success and dismal failure (pp. 70-72, 156-157). This means that the being well confirmed or not being well confirmed dichotomy is too clumsy to handle the complex issue of scientific promise. Second, Kitcher's structural model does not identify a research program with a particular set of statements (Kitcher 1984a, pp. 351-354; 1985a, pp. 144 ff.). This implies that the issue of continuity within the development of a research program (or a "scientific 75</page><page sequence="8">RECKER practice") cannot be settled simply on the basis of the support (or lack thereof) offered at any given time for its particular claims. Third, while Kitcher distinguishes pop sociobiology from a (possible) future research program that would legitimately extend the explanatory scope of evolutionary theory to human social behavior (pp. ix, 1 5, 436), it is not so clear whether such a research program could develop out of current pop sociobiological research (clearly it cannot develop out of current pop sociobiological results). That is, it is not so clear whether Kitcher thinks that pop sociobiology can 'get better'.13 So what? Well, all of this seems to imply that there can be no simple answer to the question "Can we get there from here?" when we have pop sociobiology on the one hand and some (possible) future research program which provides good evolutionary explanations of (parts of) human social behavior on the other. Kitcher has admirably displayed some of what would be needed to formulate and confirm such a program, and how present pop sociobiological claims fall dismally short of the mark. The problem is in determining how far one can extrapolate from the current (narrow) methodological status of pop sociobiology to its (possible) future development. I tend to agree with David Hull when he claims "In advance there is no way of knowing what sociobiology is going to turn out to be" (Hull 1980, p. 89). He makes this claim because he thinks there is good historical evidence that theories (like species) evolve. That is, theories are "historical entities," without essences or "timeless sets of axioms," and are consequently much more amorphous and variable in their structure and content than most (structural) philosophical models allow (Hull 1978, pp. 142-144; 1980, pp. 83-87). The development of Darwinian Evolution, for example, cannot be traced via the continuity of anything like the central or essential propositions in Darwin's theory, since few (if any!) Darwinians accepted the claims that Darwin considered to be central to his theory (Hull 1978, pp. 143-144; 1980, p. 88). Kitcher's structural model is 'tighter' than Hull's, and he also pays more attention to the structure of theories than to the behavior of scientists (though his concept of a 'scientific practice' does involve some sociological components - Kitcher 1981, pp. 509-510. 1984a, p. 352; 1985a, note 54, p. 180). On the other hand, I think it shares with Hull's model a tendency to deny that there is a direct way of getting from a set of statements to the structure of a research program. This means that even though every rung of Wilson's ladder is rotten, and even though none of the controversial claims of pop sociobiologists concerning human behavior are well supported, there could be other components within the research program of pop sociobiology (some of the questions perhaps?, or some of the general strategies?) that may prove useful to future investigators, and may lead to a development of pop sociobiology on the order of Hull's analysis of the development of Darwinian Evolution. At least it would be very difficult to rule out this possibility in advance. We have seen that it is a great value of Kitcher's analysis that his methodological critique is set within the right context, so that pop sociobiology is compared with the right exemplars rather than with some unrealizable ideal. We have also seen that when pop sociobiology is compared with either standard research within general evolutionary theory or the best work within animal sociobiology, it comes up decidedly short. On the other hand, while I would not go so far as Alexander Rosenberg (Rosenberg 1980, chs. 6-8), even the narrow methodological verdict becomes a bit more cloudy if we compare pop sociobiological research with typical research standards within the social sciences (or, more accurately with social scientific practice within non-experimental domains). 76</page><page sequence="9">A REVIEW OF KITCHER Let's consider an example. After criticizing Barash' casual study of 'adultery' among mountain bluebirds (again, because Barash fails to consider a simple and obvious alternative explanation - see note 10), for example, Stephen Jay Gould concludes that at least Barash' conclusion is plausible (though not well supported), as opposed to, James Weinrich's explanation of why [as Gould puts it] "fellatio and cunnilingus are more common among the upper classes "(Gould 1980, p. 261; Barash 1976; Weinrich 1977). The question is, is Weinrich's study less plausible because the methodology is worse, or because his conclusion about human social behavior is on the face of it less plausible (or acceptable??) than Barash' conclusion about Bluebirds? Both studies are based on loose generalizations within the inclusive fitness model, and attempt to instantiate this general model with particular cases. Barash reasons that the inclusive fitness 'payoff for males who invest heavily in their offspring would be enhanced by a tendency to protect themselves from being 'cuckolded' (Barash 1976, p. 1097). Weinrich reasons that, given the known correlation between the security of an environment and parental investment being placed more on the side of 'quality 'of offspring than 'quantity' (K- selection/r-selection- for example, Pianka 1970), and the importance of income asan index of security for Homo sapiens under modern conditions, it should be expected that individual couples whose prospective "income stream" is more stable would be more likely to engage in sexual activity primarily to enhance their pair-bond (for larger long-term investments in fewer children- presumably an example of K-selection) than couples whose prospects are unstable or low (Weinrich 1977, pp. 91-95). When we turn to narrow methodological considerations, however, I think that Weinrich's study is better than Barash'. Weinrich does consider rival hypotheses (Weinrich 1977, pp. 112-1 15), and finds them wanting. Further, the methodological tools he employs are what one would find in studies within sociological journals, and he uses them with as much care and self consciousness as I have found to be typical in this field (Weinrich 1977, pp. 97-100). The proper conclusion is not (to be sure!!) that Weinrich is likely to be right (there are more and better alternative hypotheses than he considers, he shows the typical tendency to ascend Wilson's ladder- lack of details concerning the behavior in question, how it enhances fitness, what the evolutionary mechanisms are, etc.), but that when compared with a discipline that covers roughly the same subject matter, his study is (for the most part) not much worse! That is, if one of the major narrow methodological problems with pop sociobiology is that it doesn't take rival explanations seriously enough (particularly those involving 'culture'), sociologists typically do not take possible biological causes seriously enough either (and both, because of the nature of their causal inferences, need io seriously consider rival explanations - see note 9). The moral, I think, is that Kitcher is right in stressing caution and in criticizing pop sociobiology for leaping at quick explanations just where it is most important to proceed slowly and carefully. He is also right in pointing out the many short-comings of the support offered for the controversial claims within pop sociobiology. I am only trying to stress that our acknowledged ignorance in the area of human behavior can lead to two dangers. One is to engage in rash premature speculations, and Kitcher has shown that this tendency needs to be put to rest. The other is to close the door on a. program too quickly. "Has this particular human behavior come about (partially) because it enhances fitness?" is not a nonsensical question. What is nonsense is (as Kitcher has clearly shown) to think that we are anywhere close to a meaningful answer. If the best (admittedly bad) pop sociobiological research were as clearly inferior to the normal run of sociological research as it is to the best animal studies, 77</page><page sequence="10">RECKER I would be more pessimistic. As it stands, however, our ignorance concerning the causes of human social behavior is so pronounced that we need to keep all options open. This does not mean, of course, that we should accept any supposed limits on our ability to influence human behavior (at least-until the methodological problems are eliminated). Being open-minded, as Kitcher has clearly shown, does not mean being 'empty-headed.' REFERENCES Alexander, R. D. (1974). The evolution of social behavior.

(a) "A genetically determined trait is a trait that differs from other traits at least in part as a result of the presence of one or more distinctive genes" (Wilson 1978, p. 19, emphasis added). Would anyone deny that there are some traits that are "partially influenced" by genetic coding? (b) "Sociobiology has already provided enormous insights into the behavior of nonhuman animals [and there is]... reason for optimism concerning its value for human behavior" (Barash (1982[1977]), p. 6, emphasis added). (c) "I am not going to argue about whether people who behave altruistically are 'really' doing it for secret or subconscious selfish motives. . . .My definition is concerned only with whether the effect of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary" Dawkins (1978[1976J, pp. 4- 5. 2As quick and unsystematic support for this claim, consider the following: (a) the first two volumes (8 issues) of Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology (1976-1977) contain a total of 49 articles, only one of which is predominantly concerned with human behavior (namely, Weinrich 1977); (b) most of the articles in two recent collections dedicated to the works of sociobiologists (Alexander and Tinkle 1981; Clutton-Brock and Harvey 80</page><page sequence="13">A REVIEW OF KITCHER 1978) are primarily concerned with general theoretical models, or applications of these models to the behavior of nonhuman animals; (c) even the work which is generally considered to have begun the 'sociobiology debates* (Wilson 1975b) is overwhelmingly concerned with general theoretical issues and comparative studies of animal behavior. 3Perhaps this is true of any developing theory, as Hull has persuasively argued (Hull 1978; 1980). Still, I think that it is important to try to demarcate the various research programs within sociobiology as clearly as possible. I will return to Hull's argument later when addressing Kitcher's treatment of the 4hird problem.' 4As quick and unsystematic support for this claim, consider the following. In three oft-cited volumes devoted to the sociobiology debates (Caplan 1978; Gregory, Silvers and Sutch 1978; and Montagu 1980), for example, there are a total of 73 articles, 67 of which focus exclusively or predominantly on human sociobiology, and at least half of these deal predominantly with the explosive aspects within the Business Week definition of sociobiology. 5The 'early Wilsonian' program includes various early works by E.O. Wilson (Wilson 1975b; 1978) as well as a number of the most familiar pop sociobiological works that share the same general orientation (examples: Barash 1978; (1982 [1977]); van den Berghe, 1978; 1979; 1983; Dawkins (1978 [1976]); Trivers 1972; 1974; Daly and Wilson(1983 [1978]). The 'later Wilsonian' program includes works produced by the recent collaboration of Wilson with Charles Lumsden that (allegedly) attempted to provide a more adequate treatment of 'culture' (Lumsden and Wilson, 1981; 1983;Lumsden and Gurshwurst, 1985). The 'phenotype environment' program is less concerned with grounding sociobiology within population genetics, or 'mapping genes onto behavior' (Alexander 1981, pp. 512-513; Kurland 1979, pp. 145-147) than either of the other two programs, and is therefore much less susceptible to the charge of 'genetic determinism' (which is also probably why it seems more amenable to many social scientists - examples: Alexander 1974; 1979; 1981; Chagnon and Irons 1979). 6AU page citations that are not otherwise accompanied by a reference from the bibliography are from Vaulting Ambition (Kitcher 1985b). 7Examples: 'subtle forms' of sexual selection and intrasexual competition in lions, worms, damselflies; bedbugs, grouse, elephant seals, and humans (Barash [1982(1977)], pp. 224-230); the explanatory model of inclusive fitness, first argued to be consistent with the behavior of rats, dogs, cats, langurs, pelicans, sheep, rhesus monkeys, etc., and then used to show why the celibate monk, the maiden aunt, and homosexuals need not suffer fitness losses by their apparently reproductively worthless behavior (Wilson 1975b, pp. 341-344; 554-555). See also Barash (1982[1977]), pp. 74-95, compared with pp. 128-138). 8This focusing of the narrow methodological issues is particularly important, as we will see. 9Roughly, since the action of natural selection, random drift, migration, and other possible evolutionary forces have already produced their effects on existing animals and plants, and since introducing these animals or plants or their offspring into a more controlled environment may well complicate the causal analysis, the independent variables can only be manipulated 'statistically.' Further, the effectiveness of nonexperimental design depends on bringing in as many possible causes as possible explicitly into the analysis (since one cannot here rely on randomization to 'spread the unknown causes around1). This is roughly why rival hypotheses must be considered, and why the possibility of other causes must always be taken seriously (Blalock 1964, pp. 17-26, 47-50). 10This is particularly important when the failure to even consider rival hypotheses is blatant, as it is in Barash's oft- cited study of male response to apparent female adultery in mountain bluebirds (p. 228; Barash 1976; Gould 1980; pp. 260-261). "Michael Ruse, for example, maintaining a Covering Law model of scientific theory structure for general evolutionary theory (Ruse, 1973, pp. 9-68; 198 1 , pp. 4-26) also argues that sociobiology fits this model, and hence, is 'scientific, 'at least in its general program (Ruse, 1981, pp. 191-200, 207-214). David Hull, using a sociological model for assessing scientific 'success,' uses historical examples to argue that narrow methodological criticisms are not good indicators of the eventual success of a research program (Hull 1978, pp. 137-138; 147; 161-163; 1980, pp. 83-84, pp. 89ff.) Finally, Paul Thompson, using a 'semantic' model for scientific theories, argues that the alleged untestability of pop sociobiology is not due directly to the structure of the theory (Thompson 1985, pp. 200-212). 12This structural model for evolutionary theory is an instantiation of a more general model of scientific theories outlined in Kitcher 1981, and applied to other examples in Kitcher 1982b; 1984a, pp. 351-369; 1984b, pp. 330-331. 81</page><page sequence="14">82 RECKER l3One way in which pop sociobiology couldn't 'get better' is if it simply means something like "premature and incautious attempts to provide evolutionary explanations of human social behavior. "This may approach Kitcher's use, since he does use such a presentation to separate pop sociobiology from animal sociobiology and a possible future research program that would provide legitimate explanations of human behavior.</page></plain_text>
