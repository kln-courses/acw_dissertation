<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anti-Anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch. By Charles T. Fritsch. Princeton University: Humphrey Milford. 135. U. In considering the Jewish conception of God in the fight of Jewish literary records, we find the tendency from the earliest times to combat all anthropomorphic notions and to explain away</page><page sequence="2">100 reviews of books Biblical phrases and expressions describing God after the human pattern as mere figures of speech, designed to impress upon man His per*sonal character. This tendency is reflected in certain changes in the Biblical Hebrew text, known as Tihhune Soferim (" Corrections of the Scribes "), and becomes very pronounced in the Aramaic transla tions of the Bible in which all anthropomorphisms are avoided. This anti-anthropomorphic bias is also characteristic of the Greek translators of the Old Testament. They, too, sought to spiritualize the conception of God by removing or moderating many of the human qualities or motives attributed to Him in the Bible. This characteristic of the Greek Pentateuch has already been recognized long ago, but it was left to Dr. Fritsch to deal with the subject in a systematic and comprehensive manner and to attempt a theological evaluation of the various forms of anti-anthropo morphisms that are to be found in the Greek Pentateuch. As a result of his investigation and classification of all the available data, the author has been able to establish the definite system followed by the Greek translators in their treatment of the Biblical anthropomorphisms; and shows that whilst they felt the need of eschewing anthropomorphic expressions they did not carry through this " purge " with the same consistency as the Aramaic translators. He further argues in favour of the view, propounded by scholars like Dahne and Gforer, that the anti-anthropomorphisms in the Greek Pentateuch were due to Greek influence rather than expressive of a tendency inherent in Judaism itself. This is, however, by no means convincing. While Greek influence is no doubt perceptible in idioms and certain Graecisms, the very urge the Greek translators felt to deal with the problem had its roots in Judaism. This is especially the case since the author himself would not go so far as to maintain with Dahne that they had already become familiar with the principles of Philonic philosophy. They were thus merely translators, not philosophers; but they could not help being guided by the religious ideas which were already well-established in Jewry in their times. However that may be the work is a valuable contribution to the study of the Greek Old Testament, enabling us to appraise the place it occupies in the development of the anti-anthropomorphic reactions in Judaism which reached their climax in Philo.
