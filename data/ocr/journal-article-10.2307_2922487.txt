<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nature into Art: Thoreau's Use of His Journals in A WEEK CARL F. HOVDE Ohio State University T HOREAU THE MAN has been of such enduring fascination that most of the writing about him has understandably dealt with his life and ideas. One does not wish for less of this, for the investi- gation continues to be most productive, but Thoreau also deserves to be examined as an artist more often than has been the case, as F. 0. Matthiessen pointed out some time ago.' There are many ways in which this can be done, but for certain characteristics of Thoreau's art perhaps the most revealing is to study the use made of his Journal entries, the raw material of which he built the great bulk of his finished works. The Journal presented him with special problems, and the solutions he worked out throw not a little light on his literary craftsmanship. The work under consideration here is A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, published in I849. It is an apposite example since one can watch Thoreau working out his difficulties for the first time in a full length book, and the technique is to a large degree typical of his method at any later period. A Week has special characteristics of its own, of course, but it is used here only as the basis for a stylistic study.2 For A Week, as for most of his works, Thoreau began with his Journals, the daily record of his thoughts. One might say "life and thought," except that here the two approach being the same; his long Journal, larger than Emerson's, is remarkably lean in auto- biographical detail, and concentrates on the working out of the mind's relationship to the landscape it inhabits. Like all the Tran- scendentalists, Thoreau wished to be true to himself, and the isolated, 'American Renaissance (New York, I94I), p. 76. 2The history of the book's publication and the sources of Thoreau's borrowings have been carefully described, and the work has occasionally been given critical attention, most notably by Raymond Adams in "Thoreau's Mock-Heroics and the American Natural History Writers," Studies in Philology, LII, 86-97 (Jan., I955).</page><page sequence="2">i66 American Literature often fragmentary insights recorded in the Journal represent the freshest, most immediate connections between his mind and the truth it sought to discover. It was perhaps the freshness of those insights which most ap- pealed to him. It is this quality which lastingly delights the reader of the Journal, and it is this quality in A Week which has pleased all but the most caustic critics of the book. Lowell's review praised the work for its air of "having been found, with no name attached," and Thoreau probably liked this remark, for he wished to preserve his sense of himself expressed in the spontaneity of the notebooks. Yet Thoreau knew, of course, that the Journal presented serious problems as material for his finished works. The entries, however significant and appealing, were isolated perceptions and had to be fused to form coherent works of art. To compare his final achieve- ments with the original Journal entries is to see him as an artist, as a craftsman turning his often difficult materials into wholes pos- sessed of an informing purpose. By no means all of the evidence is available for such a study of A Week. The original notebooks for most of the years before I849 have not survived. The early Journals, now in the collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library, are co-pies of passages for which Thoreau had not found a use by the time he made the transcripts, as sug- gested by the title-page of the first volume: "Gleanings-Or What Time Has Not Reaped Of My Journal."3 There are nevertheless a great many passages in the transcripts which were incorporated into A Week and Walden. There is another manuscript volume in the Morgan Library particularly revealing in a study of the earlier book. It is a tall, substantial notebook containing revisions of Journal passages, labeled as having material from August 3I, I839, through March I3, I846.4 'MA I302 in the Morgan Library, Vol. I. I wish to thank the director and the curator of manuscripts of the Morgan Library for permission to examine and quote from manuscripts in the collection. References are to entries in the manuscript Journal and are usually by date alone as most reliable; where passages are not dated, the volume is briefly described. I have not examined an early volume of transcripts recently acquired by the library and at this writing in preparation for the press. 'The reworking of passages in the available transcripts shows that it contains material from as far back as I837. I refer to it as the "work-book," using the penciled page numbers it contains.</page><page sequence="3">Nature into Art I67 The earlier date is of course the first day of the actual trip on which A Week is based. It is clear that this volume is a literary work- book, in no sense meant as a chronological record of Thoreau's experience. Most of the material consists of Journal entries trans- cribed or revised with the writing of A Week in mind; a relatively small number of entries, concentrated towards the end of the volume, point to Walden in the same way. The notebook contains what are perhaps the earliest notes for A Week as an organized work, and most of the passages represent intermediate stages between the Journal and the final text of the book. The work-book is hence a central document for the examination of Thoreau's craftsmanship. In adapting the Journal material Thoreau had to make consistent arguments and descriptions out of elliptical sentences and isolated paragraphs. He was perfectly aware of his difficulties in this enter- prise. "From all points of the compass," he wrote, from the earth beneath, and the heavens above have come these inspira- tions and been entered duly in the order of their arrival in the Journal. Thereafter when the time arrived they were winnowed into Lectures- and again in due time from Lectures into Essays-And last they stand like the cubes of Pythagoras firmly on either basis-like statues on their pedes- tals-but statues rarely take hold of hands-There is only such connexion [sic] as is attainable in the galleries. and this affects their immediate practical &amp; popular influence.5 The problem was a double one. On the one hand it was necessary to consolidate his reflections on similar subjects, and on the other to fit his reflections into the pattern of the voyage. Certain characteristics of Thoreau's mind worked in his favor for this kind of task. The Journal transcripts return again and again to themes which were especially dear to him; there were a great many similar meditations in widely separated parts of the Journal, and the very recurrence of themes made it easier for him to achieve coherence when consolidating the reflections. In general, no temporal pattern is observable in the use Thoreau made of the Journal. Occasionally, of course, many comments on a given sub- ject cluster in a certain period of time when he was thinking most On pp. penciled 63 and 64 in a small, badly mutilated volume of the Walden period. It is chronologically the seventh volume of those now in the possession of the Morgan Library. Quoted with Thoreau's revisions.</page><page sequence="4">i68 American Literature about it, but very often a single passage of A Week will contain phrases, sentences, or entire paragraphs from widely spaced periods of time. On page 3836 of A Week, for example, there are sentences from a span of five years' writing. The first full paragraph on this page, a meditation on the infinite variety of the skies, begins with a rewriting of a passage from November I7, I837. The third para- graph begins with a sentence written April 3, i842, continues with one from April 30, I839, and the remainder of the paragraph, except for the last sentence, is from a Journal entry of March 22, I840. This kind of montage was possible for Thoreau because the unity of his meditative writing is created not so much by the development of single ideas carried out to their conclusions, as by the tone of the thought and language. His paragraphs often lack anything which could be called a "topic sentence." Reflections on similar subjects, when unified, are held together by the personality of the writer as much as by the argument. In the paragraphs referred to above, the sentences are only slightly altered from their original Journal form; their thought and mood were so similar that they fitted to- gether naturally. But problems remained, of course. The recurrence of Thoreau's interests did not prevent him from being interested in a great many things which seem to have little to do with one another. Too, his separate reflections on the same general subjects often had colors of their own which would not blend felicitously. Often the thoughts would not easily mesh into one another-would not achieve the fluidity which he so much prized. An example of such difficulty occurs at the end of "Saturday." Thoreau drew upon two separate Journal entries to complete his reflections upon the night sounds heard during the first evening of the trip. The first he revised, and there are hence three passages leading to the final version. And now I see the beauty and full meaning of that word sound. Na- ture always possesses a certain so- norousness, as in the hum of insects -the booming of ice-the crowing of cocks in the morning and the All these sounds-the hum of in- sects at noon-the crowing of cocks in the morning-the baying of dogs at night-are the evidence of na- tures [sic] health or soundness.

(Journal, March 3, I84I) A word is wiser than any man- than any series of words. In its present received sense it may be false, but in its inner sense by de- scent and analogy it approves itself. Language is the most perfect work of art in the world. The chisel of a thousand years retouches it. (Jour- nal, July 27, I840) The night is equally indebted to the clarion of the cock, with wake- ful hope, from the very setting of the sun, prematurely ushering in the dawn. All these sounds, the crowing of cocks, the baying of dogs, and the hum of insects at noon, are the evidence of nature's health or sound state. Such is the never-failing beauty and accuracy of language, the most perfect art in the world; the chisel of a thousand years retouches it. (A Week, pp. 40-4I) Some time after Thoreau had completed the work-book revision of the first entry, he felt that this thought had a connection with another idea, and wrote in pencil above the revision, "This reminds one of the truth [?] and beauty of language." Accordingly, in the final version he united the revised passage upon the "soundness" of nature and the Journal entry on the character of language. He was less successful than usual. From the Journal passage on language he wished to take only the pithy last sentence, and yet this sentence is made fully intelligible only by the preceding sen- tences in the entry. The play on the word "sound," italicized in A Week as it is not in the Journal or the work-book, does provide a measure of transition, but not enough to make the shift of atten- tion comfortable. The beginning of the sentence "Such is the never- failing beauty and accuracy of language . . ." points backward to the preceding sentence as an explanation of what is to come, but this earlier sentence does not, in fact, contain the reasons needed to understand the last clause. Usually Thoreau is much more careful about the logic of his transitions. On p. 56 of A Week he is in the midst of a discussion of the difference between the natural qualities of primitive life typified by the Indian, and the artificial ones of civilized man.</page><page sequence="6">170 American Literature There are again three passages relevant to the final text; a Journal entry, a revision of it, and a work-book passage presumably a re- working of another Journal entry. The best poets, after all, exhibit only a tame and civil side of nature -They have not seen the west side of any mountain. Day and night-mountain and wood are visible from the wilder- ness as well as the village. They have their primeval aspects-stern- er savager-than any poet has sung. It is only white man's poetry-we want the Indian's report. Words- worth is too tame for the Chippe- way. (Journal, August i8, I841) If the Indian is somewhat of a stranger in nature-the gardener is too much a familiar. There is something vulgar and foul in the latter's closeness to his mistress, something noble and cleanly in the formers [sic] distance. Yet the hunter seems to have a property in the moon which even the farmer has not. Ah!-The poet knows uses of plants which are not easily reported, though he cultivates no parterre; See how the sun smiles on him while he walks in the gar- dener's aisles, rather than on the gardener. (Work-book, p. I75) The poets exhibit but a tame and civil side of nature. They have not gone west of the mountains. There are sterner savager-and more pri- meval aspects than they have sung. It is only white man's poetry. If we could get a clear report from the Indian it would be different- for he is more conversant with pure waters. We should do him more justice and understand better why he will not exchange his savageness for civilization. I cannot think him wilful-for steel and blankets are strong temptations. (Work-book, p. 44, as revised) The Indian's intercourse with Na- ture is at least such as admits of the greatest independence of each. If he is somewhat of a stranger in her midst, the gardener is too much of a familiar. There is something vulgar and foul in the latter's close- ness to his mistress, something noble and cleanly in the former's distance. In Civilization, as in a southern latitude, man degenerates at length, and yields to the incur- sion of more northern tribes,- "Some nation yet shut in With hills of ice." There are other, savager and more primeval aspects of nature than our poets have sung. It is only white man's poetry. (A Week, p. 56)</page><page sequence="7">Nature into Art I7I Because Thoreau wished to criticize the tameness of "white man's poetry" by using the Journal entry, he omitted the favorable refer- ence to the poet in the second passage from the work-book. The introduction of the two lines of poetry, in a sentence dealing with the decay of civilization, leads the reader to the literary remark which follows. Apart from the skilful organization shown in the final version, one is struck by the greater economy of the language, a stylistic goal towards which Thoreau worked no matter what the materials under his hand. The most obvious change one notices when comparing the Journal passages with the final product is that a great amount of cutting and condensation has been done. With very few exceptions the passages in A Week are much shorter than their sources, be they in the Journals or the later manuscript drafts. Sometimes this is simply a matter of using only a part of a thought in the original entry, but more often it is a careful selection of the most pithy, weighted phrases from a longer passage, and a careful revision of these few phrases to bring them still farther towards the goal of a perfect style. To say that Thoreau was careful to harmonize dis- parate passages is not to say, of course, that he is at pains to develop long, sustained arguments; he often shifts attention very rapidly in the work, but there is abundant evidence that he recognized the shortcomings of a collection of pense'es, and that he showed much skill in combining his material into larger wholes. II In writing A Week Thoreau had not only to combine similar but separate meditations into larger units, but also to integrate these reflective passages, separate or collected, with the descriptions of the voyage itself. The later problem was perhaps an especially difficult one for him; it is at least less successfully solved as the book moves on, until in "Friday" we are left with little voyage material, and even the meditations follow one another with a lack of coherence often confusing and even careless. Part of the difficulty arises from Thoreau's respect for the sheer, hard fact. He loved the long, detailed reports of early travelers, and was probably as well read in this kind of literature as anyone else in his time. Yet in so far as he was original, he was a contempla- tive man; the remarkable thing about him is the fusion of intellect</page><page sequence="8">172 American Literature with power of observation. In A Week he tried to achieve a balance between the two kinds of voyages-that of body and that of mind. I do not imply that they were separated in his view; the world of nature was for him a symbol of spirit, and the actual voyage was a metaphor for the spiritual one. But he felt none the less obliged to be true to the facts as they appeared, and the actual trip had to be accurately described. He strove for a constant alternation between the physical world, which deserved all the attention it could be given, and the world of mind. His reflections are often, though not always, inspired by the things he notices about him. It has been usual to describe A Week as a patchwork of thoughts unsuccessfully threaded on a chronological journey, but the interplay between the physical and mental worlds is deliberate with Thoreau. It is not always well done, but when it is, it achieves just the qualities he so much prized-diversity, many- sidedness, and a fluidity of attention and thought which in the book is symbolized by the movement of water. Just as the quotations above show how carefully Thoreau ad- dressed himself to the problems inherent in his contemplative mate- rial, so there are many examples of his desire for directness and economy in the description of the trip itself. Fidelity to the physical fact was not, he thought, an easy thing to attain; while he had to make comprehensible the continual shifts from fact to reflection, he had to make quite certain that the physical detail itself was a true re-creation of his -impressions. In a paragraph most revealing for his artistic attitudes Thoreau observed: We can never safely exceed the actual facts in our narratives. Of pure invention, such as some suppose, there is no instance. To write a true work of fiction even is only to take leisure and liberty to describe some things more exactly as they are. A true account of the actual is the rarest poetry, for common sense always takes a hasty and superficial view. (A Week, p. 347) That he used uncommon sense when looking at the visible world is very clear in his revisions of descriptive material in the Journal; his changes are almost always towards a more simple, direct, and infor- mative sentence. This movement towards a "true account of the actual" is well illustrated in the revisions of Journal sources for the end of "Satur-</page><page sequence="9">Nature into Art '73 day." The entry for August 3I, I839, the first day of the voyage on which the book was based, now exists as a copy made in the entry for June 2I, I840; it was revised in the work-book. Selected parallel passages reveal a good deal about what Thoreau thought the "actual" to be. Journal Scrambling up the bank of our terra incognita we fall on huckleberries which have slowly rip- ened here, husbanding the juices which the months have distilled, for our peculiar use this night.

(p. 25, without revisions) we could detect only a ripple in the water ruf- fling the disk of a star. (P. 39) The most obvious change here is a movement towards the simple, immediately presented fact. With one exception, these pas- sages are quite theoretical in the Journal, less abstract in the work- book, and closely attentive to physical detail in the final version. This is not to say, of course, that the final versions contain less emotion or thought than the first two; the achievement is that the really significant details have been singled out and are permitted to operate at their full power. They no longer have to filter through less important material. And much of the original Journal material is not only less im- portant than the actual scene but is damaging to it. Of the four groups of passages above, three of the Journal entries contain much speculation about the relationship between the world of man and the world of nature. "Why," he writes, "should we not cultivate neighborly relations with the foxes? . . . Has not the time come when men and foxes shall lie down together?" Again, the "pre- sumption" of the muskrat kindles a "brotherly feeling." The trouble with these remarks is not that nature and man are brought into close relation, but that nature and man are confused. The difficulty is not that the point of view is anthropomorphic, for this is not nec- essarily a fault, but that the attitude is sentimental. The fact is that the time has not come for man, musquash, and fox to lie down together-at least without considerable detriment to all parties concerned. Man must protect himself against much of</page><page sequence="12">T76 American Literature the animal world, and has learned to use much of it for his own benefit. Thoreau's passion for the muskrat is quite properly extin- guished in a rush to save the potatoes, as the revision of the passage suggests. The animal and human worlds are related, to be sure, but it was the very "wildness" of the wild which most appealed to Thoreau; he loved it because it was other than human. The famous fox he chased across the Walden ice was a fox, not a brother, and this is the source of its power to move us. The wild suggests a psychological truth about man, it reminds him of the depth and richness of his own nature, but it is part of man's essence that he is a moral and rational creature, and part of the animal's that it is not. Thoreau was pri- marily a moralist, though he disliked the word, and it was his tough-mindedness that caused him to drop the passages above. He had an uncommonly sharp eye for this kind of flabbiness, and seldom fell into it except for an occasional passage when dealing with general ideas not sufficiently related to the particular facts of the world. Here he caught the mistake and brought his eye back to the object before him. The formal changes in these examples are less striking than those in point of view but are none the less revealing. The economy of the final versions is not simply the result of eliminated detail but of Thoreau's having "charged" the few words with which he ended. An idea or description given a sentence or a phrase in the Journal is usually suggested by a word or two in the last draft. In the discussion of huckleberries, he wished to retain the sense of sur- prise he and his brother felt at finding them. This is treated at considerable length in the Journal passage; in the work-book the purple patch has been cut in half. In the last version the "palatable" of the work-book is dropped, since this is obvious if the berries are ripe, and the sense of wonder at finding them does the work of the "devout feeling" of the two earlier drafts. In the passage on the boat, Thoreau retains from the Journal, with some revision, the de- scription of the craft as having just come to rest from the motion of the stream. The second historical reference in the work-book draft is dropped as unnecessary after the allusion to the Roman port, and the two sentences about the "straight geometrical line" are united. When dealing with the lack of human life in the night,</page><page sequence="13">NVature into Art I77 Thoreau reduced the three sentences of the Journal version to one, and expressed the relation between the two "lives," those of man and nature, by the metaphor of breathing, a rhythmical movement akin to that of the water. The paragraph cited earlier, dealing with the need for "actual facts," goes on with a comment about Goethe, and continues to be most revealing about Thoreau's sense of his enterprise. Though I am not much acquainted with the works of Goethe, I should say that it was one of his chief excellences as a writer, that he was satis- fied with giving an exact description of things as they appeared to him, and their effect upon him. Most travelers have not self-respect enough to do this simply, and make objects and events stand around them as the centre, but still imagine more favorable positions and relations than the actual ones, and so we get no valuable report from them at all. (A Week, p* 347) This is a double-edged statement for Thoreau. It is typical in that it expresses his love for fact-for sheer information of the kind which appears so much in the later Journals and in the Indian note- books. He loved to know things and to record what he had learned about both history and nature. But it seems strange for him to com- plain that most travelers "imagine more favorable positions than the actual ones." He himself improved upon "actual" positions. In a Journal entry for September 4, I84I, he sees from Pond Hill two men float- ing in a boat, and in A Week (p. 48) the scene of this observation is changed to Concord River, upon which he is voyaging. Sabbath bells, whose sound he disliked, resounded against "these cliffs" when he heard them on August I9, I838; because he wished to use his earlier reflection on their character in A Week they there resound from far away upon "these shores" (p. 78). A particularly sensitive change is seen in what Thoreau did with the imagery in a Journal description of an outing on the Concord River. The other day I rowed in my boat a free-even lovely young lady-and as I plied the oars she sat in the stern-and On this same river a young maiden once sailed in my boat-thus solitary and unattended but by invisible spirits- On this same stream a maiden once sailed in my boat, thus unattend- ed but by invisible guar- dians, and as she sat in</page><page sequence="14">178 American Literature there was nothing but she between me and the sky So might all our lives be picturesque if they were free enough -but mean relations and prejudices intervene to shut out the sky, and we never see a man as simple and distinct as the man-weathercock on a steeple. (Journal, June I9, I840) As she sat in the prow there was nothing but herself between me and the sky-So that her form and life itself was picturesque as rocks and trees-She was not child to any mortal, and had no protector she called no mortal father. Nc priest was keeper of her soul no guardian of her free thoughts. She dared ever to stand exposed on the side of heaven. (Work-book, p. 22) the prow there was nothing but herself be- tween the steersman and the sky. (A Week, p. 45) The most interesting changes occur between the Journal and the work-book. Thoreau first of all eliminates the immediate temporal reference, for obvious reasons, changing it to an indefinite "On this same stream . . . once. . . ." The reference to the "same stream" helps give a sense of the long association and familiarity with the countryside which he possessed and wished to communicate. But the really revealing change is that from the row-boat to the sail- boat. He wished to present visual images of the utmost calm and beauty, and hence changed the picture from one involving physical effort on his part to one in which activity has disappeared in the more beautiful motion of the sailing craft. The girl was moved from the stern of the boat to the prow, where she presents a more striking outline against the sky. Sometimes he introduced references and images beyond the "ac- tual ones" to remind the reader of the dominant images of the work -water, silence, time, and so on. In his Journal entry for March 30, i842, he discusses the apparent freedom nature permits those people who run to excess. The entire paragraph, carefully rewritten, is included in A Week, but with an added reference to a river. Men of vicious habits still "maintain life along the way, keeping this side the Styx, still hearty, still resolute, 'never better in their lives'..." (p. 34). This new detail, added after the revision of this passage in the work-book (pp. 79-80), is not only appropriate to the subject at hand, but also makes the meditation more at home in the book,</page><page sequence="15">Nature into Art I79 as it is surrounded by a discussion of the Concord River and its fish. Thoreau's indifference to fiction is perhaps the key to what he means by those who "imagine more favorable positions and rela- tions than the actual ones." That he disliked novels did not imply a denial of the artistic gift or of the reality of metaphor. He was a poet and never tired of trying to describe the poet's task, often using metaphor to do so. He ignored fiction not because it was imaginative, but because it presented fabrications of everyday life; myth and the epic, which he loved, worked with other materials. Flights of fancy about common life had always, for him, to be rooted in the particular people and places, sights and sounds of the daily life about the writer. The mind could work with this experience, and indeed any really sensitive mind would do so, but it must start with the specific materials known to it, observable to others as well. This is why a "true account of the actual is the rarest poetry." The rarest gift, for Thoreau, was the uncommon sense to see the real behind the apparent. In the transcendental theory of which there is so much in A Week, all natural objects are symbols of spirit, and Tho- reau saw little point in inventing new symbols and rearranging them when there was an infinite nature about him whose suggestions he could never exhaust. III There are other changes in Journal material which have a less impressive rationale than the desire for "purified fact," as in the re- vision of physical descriptions of the trip itself, or the interweaving of short reflective passages to form sustained meditations. These refinements are nevertheless impressive as evidence of Thoreau's close attention to his craft, and taken as a whole they go far towards creating the unity of the work. There are many changes of tone between the Journal and the finished text. The temper of Journal entries written under the pressure of the moment sometimes proved unsuitable. Often the private, occasionally hesitant mood of the Journal had to be changed into the necessarily public tone of a sustained performance. Altera- tions of this kind give authority to the subjects he writes about. Personal views are attributed to others or assumed as common knowledge, and phrases such as "I think," "I feel," and "it seems"</page><page sequence="16">I80 American Literature usually drop out in revision. The thoughts remain in character, of course, but lose their original setting. For example, in a Journal entry dated November i6, I837, Tho- reau wondered about the possible relationship between the move- ment of Concord River and the character of those living on its banks. "Who knows how much of the proverbial moderation of the inhabi- tants was caught from its dull circulation." In "Concord River" this thought is no longer a private speculation. "Concord River is remarkable for the gentleness of its current, which is scarcely perceptible, and some have referred to its influence the proverbial moderation of the inhabitants of Concord, as exhibited in the Revo- lution, and on later occasion" (p. 7). These same generalization of personal attitude and incident is seen in these two passages: Here at my elbow sit five notable, or at least noteworthy, representa- tives of this nineteenth century-of the gender feminine. One a sedate -indefatigable knitter, not spinster, of the old school-who had the supreme felicity to be born in days that tried men's souls.... (Journal, March 4, I838) I fancy that some indefatigable spinster of the old school, who had the supreme 'felicity to be born in "days that tried men's souls," hear- ing this, may say with Nestor, an- other of the old school, "But you are younger than I." (A Week, p. 66) The Journal entry must refer to an evening Thoreau actually spent, or perhaps to paintings or engravings on his desk. At some later time he revised the original passage in the Journal, using pencil, and approached almost exactly the wording of A Week, where the specific scene is eliminated. He has changed a particular description into a generalized speculation; there is no longer the sense of a special personality. There are other changes in tone which result not from the pres- sure of an audience but from the force of a new context. Journal passages which occur as quiet observations about nature, in no particular context at all, are occasionally placed in a setting of opin- ionated argument, so that they heighten the point by contrast. The development of a passage for "Monday" illustrates this.</page><page sequence="17">Nature into Art i8i Are setting hens trou- bled with ennui Nature is very kind-does she let them reflect?

Think you that sitting hens are troubled with ennui these long summer days * . .(A Week, p. I30) Thus the quiet tone of the original observation serves as a rhetorical tool in Thoreau's argument against the fuss and hurry of public agitation. Some Journal entries serve a persuasive purpose quite different from the one they possessed originally. In the Journal of I845, for example, there is a long passage on mythology in which Thoreau gives a theory of progress of the human race. This paragraph is followed by a quotation apparently intended to support this view of the development of man. "Aristeus 'found out honey and oil' 'He obtained of Jupiter and Neptune, that the pestilential heat of the dog days, wherein was great mortality, should be mitigated with wind."" In A Week this passage occurs in "Sunday," and Thoreau describes the story as "one of those dateless benefits conferred on man which have no record in our vulgar day. . ." (p. 58). The whole emphasis has been changed from progress to decay. A change in the context of a quotation from Virgil also shows a shift in meaning, if a less radical one. In the Journal for Novem- ber 20, I837, he reads Virgil "if only that I might be reminded of the identity of human nature in all ages. I take satisfaction in 'jam laeto turgent in palmite gemmae,' or 'Strata jacent passim sua quae- que sub arbore poma.' It was the same world, and the same men inhabited it." In the work-book the passage is rewritten in a form closer to that used in A Week. "I should read Virgil if only to be reminded of the identity of human nature in all ages. I am pleased with such lines as. ...8 In A Week, as in the work-book, it is 7Last paragraph before the entry for Friday, Dec. 12, 1845. 4P. 4. Just before this entry is a penciled note showing how Thoreau used the work- book: "Read our navigator Gazeteer-text of a book." In the finished work the Virgil passage is immediately preceded by Thoreau's remark that he and his brother read the</page><page sequence="18">i82 American Literature pleasant "to meet with such lines as. . . ," but the quotations are introduced by the reflection that "even Virgil's poetry serves a very different use to me to-day from what it did to his contemporaries. It has often an acquired and accidental value merely, proving that man is still man in the world" (p. 93). Thus the same center of attention could produce thoughts of varying or even opposite kinds in Thoreau when he dealt with it at another time. Finally, a few Journal entries are given a local habitation arising from an almost private form of humor. The launching of the "Musquitaquid," the boat he and his brother built for the voyage, is perhaps the best example. The boat took to the water-from of old there had been a tacit league struck between these two-and now it gladly availed itself of the old law that the heavier shall float the lighter. (Journal, June IYI, I840) In the present case our boat took readily to the wate[r], since from of old there had been a tacit league struck be- tween them, and now it gladly availed itself of the old law that the heavier shall float the lighter. (Work-book, p. '5) However, as art is all of a ship but the wood, and yet the wood alone will rudely serve the purpose of a ship, so our boat, being of wood, gladly availed itself of the old law that the heavier shall float the lighter, and though a dull water-fowl, proved a sufficient buoy for our purpose. (A Week, p. I3) The "old law" in the work-book version reminded Thoreau of a quotation he had copied three days after the Journal passage cited above. In an entry for June 14, I840, he had quoted, in Greek, Aristotle's definition of art without translation and without com- ment. In A Week (p. 386) this is quoted and translated as "The principle of the work without the wood." Earlier in A Week, how- ever, he saw an opportunity to combine the launching of the boat and the Aristotelian definition in a playful way. The final version quoted above uses the definition in passing, and without attribution, while the complicated logical structure of the sentence satirizes the Aristotelian syllogism. He thus "domesticates" a classical reference into the story of the voyage, this time in a humorous way. Gazeteer, and by a reflection that everything printed and bound in a book "contains some echo at least of the best that is in literature" (A Week, p. 93).</page><page sequence="19">Nature into Art I83 In matters of tone, such as this, and in considerations of struc- ture and description discussed earlier, Thoreau tried to make the best possible use of the materials available to him. The Journal presented him with difficult problems, for it contained largely reflections as "on pedestals," and these had to be integrated with one another, as well as harmonized with the voyage in such a way as not to bewilder the reader, while at the same time making large demands upon him. He was not always successful in his attempt to do this, but he achieved success more often than critics of the book have generally realized. While the Journal presented difficulties, it was at the same time the material he most prized. The keeping of a Journal was for Thoreau a kind of dedication; it was his way of discovering the truths that mattered to him, and this was in his eyes the highest task a man could set himself, and the most difficult. Thus his task in writing A Week was complicated by his enormous respect for the donnee; the book was his first full-scale effort, and in its compo- sition he faced for the first time the problem of using his "building blocks" for a large and solid structure. The work is technically experimental, and the restless revisions in all the extant manuscripts show to what extent he felt this himself. The fidelity with which he worked with the Journal arose not from simple infatuation with his own productions, but from a sense of its harmony with his view of the possibilities of knowledge. Similarly, his awareness of the comparative intractability of the en- tries was allied to what he felt to be the obstacles in the way of any search for ultimate meanings. Because the truth was hard to come by, the perceptions, the insights, the visions which he recorded he felt to be woefully inadequate expressions of the possible meanings behind the words. This sense of linguistic shortcoming was one of the major stimuli which drove him to the painstaking revision in some measure illustrated above. Thoreau's sense of his inadequacies-drawbacks which he felt not to be personal but perhaps typical of the finest minds-was created by his view of true perceptions as fleeting insights whose power could not be sustained. All ultimate truth, he felt, lay in the realm of the divine, of spirit. For his literary theory and practice, the important thing is that revelations are rare. They are the "flitting</page><page sequence="20">184 American Literature perspectives and demi-experiences of the life that is in nature. . (A Week, p. 7). They are outside of time because they show us the reality for which time is a symbol. It is because of the transience of our most vivid apprehensions of truth that Thoreau had such a hatred of dogma; one cannot inherit a sense of what the world means. And because of their transience they created problems for him as a writer. On one hand, his expression did not do justice to the original perception, for he felt that the poet can engage in artistic production only when he is no longer "possessed" by his insight. This feeling spurred him to the endless revision of small details within the separate thoughts. Moreover, the particular thoughts, developed into the most perfect form of which he was capable, were even then simply more beautiful building blocks than they had been before, and he was faced with the task of making them do service in a large work. This study began with a citation showing Tho- reau's awareness of the latter problem, his recognition that the Journal entries were "like statues on their pedestals-but statues rarely take hold of hands." As an artist he had to play Pygmalion to his own productions, and to watch him do this is to see high love create communal grace.</page></plain_text>
