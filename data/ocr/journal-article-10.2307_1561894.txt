<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY A POLITICS OF EATING: FEASTING IN EARLY GREEK SOCIETY In Euripides' Cyclops, Silenus and his satyr companions have been shipwrecked in the realm of Polyphemus and have become his slaves.1 Odysseus lands there, meets Silenus, and, conversing with him, asks who inhabits the land: Odysseus: Who occupies the area? A race of beasts? Silenus: Cyclopes. They live in caves, not roofed houses. Odysseus: Who is their leader? Or do they have a democracy? Silenus: They're herdsmen. No one has any power over anyone else. Odysseus: Do they sow Demeter's grain? Or what do they live on? Silenus: Milk and cheeses and meals [borai] of mutton. Odysseus: Do they have Dionysus' drink, the liquid of the vine? Silenus: Not at all. For that reason, they live in a land without choruses. Odysseus: Are they hospitable, and do they treat strangers with respect? Silenus: They claim that strangers have the most delicious flesh. *I must express gratitude to Robert Renehan, Mark Griffith, and Anthony Long for reading and commenting on this paper in its various incarnations. The comments of George Kennedy, former editor of AJP, and the anonymous reviewer have been of im- mense value as well. Of course, whatever inadequacies remain in it are my responsibility, not theirs. I also must express a debt of gratitude to several scholars whose writings, listed in the bibliography, have been particularly influential in its formation. Three scholars stand out in their attempts to make sense of the social dynamics that underlie Homeric poems. They are Walter Donlan, Moses Finley, and Bj0rn Quiller. Various writings on Greek com- mensality have also been important: Pauline Schmitt Pantel's monumental study, La cite au banquet; the collection of essays edited by William Slater, Dining in a Classical Context, Oswyn Murray's articles cited in the bibliography as well as the collection of essays edited by him under the title Sympotica; and Suzanne Sai'd's essay, "Les crimes des pretendants," which deals with commensality specifically in the Homeric poems.

They like meals [borai] of men they have killed? Silenus: Every one who comes here has been eaten up. (117-28) Silenus has rapidly made clear the beastly level of Cyclopean gastron- omy. The savagery of the Cyclopes' diet is underlined by his diction: the LSJ tells us that the word translated twice here as "meals," borai, is more appropriately used to describe food for animals than for people. Silenus also lets us know that the Cyclopes are herdsmen and, like atavistic throwbacks to a time before cereal culture, raise no grain.2 They are so backward that they do not have even wine. One dire consequence of this is spelled out by Silenus: they have no choruses. Polyphemus himself later illustrates another: they totally lack sympotic sophistication (483- 589). So great is their culinary degeneracy, that, in defiance of the ac- cepted norms of hospitality, they eat strangers who visit their realm. Not only, however, do the Cyclopes lack the elements of a cultured cuisine, they also lack basic political institutions. They have no ruler, nor do they have a democracy: as Silenus says, "no one has any power over anyone else." The lack of political institutions and of culinary development may at first seem like two independent elements of a culturally deprived life. This is not the case, however. We shall see that in early Greek culture there is a strong connection between eating and politics. Indeed, it will soon be apparent that the Cyclopes' culinary and political deficiencies are closely related. It is my hope to demonstrate this relationship. Emphasis will be placed on representations of eating in the Iliad and the Odyssey. It will then be shown how the patterns uncovered in Homeric texts lived on in later documents and institutions. It is impossible to know how accurately the life portrayed in the Homeric poems represents the historical condi- tions of any real society.3 It may be true that the analysis of institutions 2Shaw ("Eaters of Flesh") examines the ancient bias against pastoral ways of life. Interestingly, Dicaearchus indicated that pastoralism preceded grain agriculture in his scheme of human cultural development (Porph. Abst. 4.1.2). 3The debate over how accurately the Homeric representation of society portrays any existent society, whether contemporary with the composition of the Homeric corpus or earlier, has gone on for decades now. Treatments of the topic are found in Finley, World of Odysseus; Snodgrass, "An Historical Homeric Society?"; Posner, "The Homeric Version of the Minimal State" 44; Quiller, "Dynamics of Homeric Society" 113-14; Donlan, "Politics of Generosity," "Reciprocities," "Scale, Value, and Function," "Social Groups"; and Morris, "Use and Abuse."</page><page sequence="3">A POLITICS OF EATING 181 described in them is relevant only to an ideal world or to an aristocratic ideology. Such complex issues, however, may be avoided by merely ana- lyzing certain aspects of eating as presented by Homer without thought of how well those aspects match the practice of any actual people. In the endeavor, of course, caution must be exercised not to expect too much of the data. Even if Homer's narrative does represent some actual society, it is the nature of narrative to be selective, and it would therefore be in- appropriate to try to extract from the poems either a comprehensive pic- ture of foodways or any quantitative data about them. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to be struck by how consistent representations of eating in Homer are, and, moreover, not to acknowledge that patterns revealed in the Homeric representations had a long afterlife not only in later texts but even in social institutions. FEASTING AND THE HOMERIC POLITICAL ECONOMY On the shield of Achilles, a microcosm of the Iliadic world, is wrought a scene which reveals some political aspects of eating. And he put on it [the shield] the precinct of a king. There workmen were reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Some of the bunches of grain were falling thickly to the ground in the wake of the sickles; the sheaf- binders were binding others with ties of straw; three sheaf-binders stood by ready while in the rear children were picking up the bunches, bearing them away in their arms and constantly handing them over. In the middle, glad in heart, the king stood with his scepter next to the swath cut through the grain. At a distance heralds [kerukes] were preparing a feast [daita] un? der an oak, busying themselves around a large ox they had slaughtered. Meanwhile, the women prepared [palunon] white barley as a meal [deip- non] for the workmen. (Hom. //. 18.550-60) This image encodes something about the political and economic organi? zation of the Homeric world. The workmen gather in wealth?here, the harvest?for the king, the center of power. He in turn redistributes from his own wealth food for the workmen. Karl Polanyi,4 an economist of the mid-century, pointed out the significance of this centripetal movement of goods which then are redistributed. He claimed that market activity, 4I disagree with Polanyi's major thesis, that standard market analysis is irrelevant to economies where no obvious markets can be said to exist. Nevertheless, the taxonomy he advances is a useful qualitative description of various types of economic activity.</page><page sequence="4">182 JOHN RUNDIN which he calls exchange and whose study dominates the science we call formal economics, is only one of several major modes of goods transfer. Another is reciprocity, which "denotes movement between correlative points of symmetrical groupings." It typically involves what we might consider gift-giving.5 Alcinous, for instance, gives Odysseus gifts when Odysseus stays in Phaeacia. In this gift-giving, "movement between cor? relative points of symmetrical groupings" has occurred: from Alcinous, the head of a household and a guest-friend to Odysseus, the head of a household and another guest-friend. Another mode of goods transfer is redistribution, which "designates appropriational movements toward a center and out of it again" (Polanyi, "Instituted Process" 250). In redis- tributive economic activity, goods are gathered to a center, from which they are then dispersed. It is clear that, in the passage from the shield, when we see the workmen gather in grain from the fields and in turn be given grain as a meal, we are witnessing a redistributive mechanism at work. Moreover, we are witnessing how food?here, grain and meat?is channeled by the mechanism's working. In itself, that fact might seem interesting but irrelevant to politics. However, there is a strong connection between possessing political power and being the central figure in a redistributive scheme, particu? larly in a society like that portrayed by Homer. Richard Seaford writes: Homeric society has been classified, from the perspective of comparative anthropology, as the kind of pre-state society called 'chiefdom', or more specifically 'low level' or 'immature' chiefdom, in which there is unstable centralized direction, with the power of the political leader (basileus) based not on centralized institutions, stratification, or a formal apparatus of repression, but on wealth, prestige, military prowess, an informal au? thority over the other like-named chiefs (basileis), and on his ability to act as redistibutor.6 (Reciprocity and Ritual 22) 5Gift-giving and its importance to non-industrial societies has been the subject of vast literature in anthropology. Marcel Mauss opened up the topic in 1925 with his "Essai sur le don," translated into English as The Gift. More recent major treatments of the topic include Gregory, Gifts and Commodities, and Weiner, Inalienable Possessions. Moses Fin- ley is most to be credited with bringing it to the attention of classicists with his World of Odysseus. Since Finley, numerous classicists have worked on gift-giving in the ancient Greek world. Among them are Walter Donlan in "Scale, Value, and Function," "The Politics of Generosity," "Reciprocities in Homer," and "Unequal Exchange"; Ian Morris in "Gift and Commodity"; and Richard Seaford in Reciprocity and Ritual. 6Compare Bj0rn Quiller's conclusions ("Dynamics" 120).</page><page sequence="5">A POLITICS OF EATING 183 Marshall D. Sahlins has stated that "much of primitive economy is 'household economy' " ("Political Power" 408). Thus there is a natural tendency to limit production to meet only the household's needs.7 If pro? duction is to be intensified, some agent, whose principal action, the col- lecting and redistribution of goods, is political in nature, must be the moving force, and he occupies a position of prestigious political power.8 In a much quoted line, he has written, "Redistribution is chieftainship said in economics" (Tribesmen 95). The connection between redistribution and political power is re- peatedly demonstrated in the Homeric poems.9 Often redistributive ac- tivity is marked by words related to the word daiomai, which goes back to a root that means "to divide" (Chantraine, Dictionnaire s.v. daiomai), and it is most evident when the dividing up of booty is described. Thus, Achilles in his quarrel with Agamemnon, when he protests that Aga? memnon cannot be compensated for Chryseis with a gift, makes ref? erence to a distribution of booty among the Achaeans using the word dedastai (II 1.125) from dateomai, a relative of daiomai. Again, when Odysseus and his men raid the Cicones, we see a redistributive mecha? nism at work. For, having killed the men and seized their wives and trea- sure, the Achaeans divided [dassameth': again from dateomai] the booty 7In Sahlins' words: "Primitive society does not inherently produce a surplus; the sys- tem of ownership and production moves to inhibit the generation of a surplus.... [This] centripetal tendency stands directly in the way of a tribal-wide economy. It is only over- come by the attribution of prestige to those who administer the tribal economy, thus giving them the ability to stimulate the production upon which, in turn, their economic functions rest" ("Political Power" 409). 8Sahlins writes: "The principal administrative operation in a tribal economy, there? fore, is pooling and redistribution of goods by a central agent. Everywhere, this central agent occupies a political, chiefly status and his redistributive activities subsidize the divi? sion of labor and tribal enterprise. Prestige is attributed to the chief so long as he manages goods in the general welfare. This prestige not only permits the chief to influence persons, it sanctions his call on goods. Prestige, therefore, operates to overcome an inherent ten? dency to limit productivity in a system of production for use (as opposed to production for exchange). Prestige is the action of a social system operating to widen the economy at the same time, and by means of increasing the powers of the administrating chief. It follows that the growth of political power and the development of a tribal economy are in direct and reciprocal relation, and both are similarly related to economic productivity" ("Political Power" 410). 9Borivoj Borecky has surveyed the importance of distribution in early Greek soci? ety in two works, "Primitive Origin" and Survivals ofSome Tribal Ideas. Peter Rose briefly discusses the thematic importance of distribution in the Iliad in Sons ofthe Gods 78-82.</page><page sequence="6">184 JOHN RUNDIN among themselves in such a way that no man, Odysseus claims, was cheated out of a fair share because of him (Od. 9.42). Here is apparent not only a redistribution but also the fact that the political leader takes charge of it. This perception of the importance of redistribution is re- inforced by the complex maneuverings around the division of booty in a story that Nestor relates of a Pylian raid on the Epeians.The Pylian lead- ers come together and divide [daitreuon: from daitreuo, a relative of dai? omai] the booty; the king takes a special portion and arranges that the rest be fairly divided [daitreuein] among the people (//. 11.671-705). Again we see an association of the politically powerful with redistribu? tion. Rights to land usage may also undergo a redistributive process. When Nausithous founds his polis after fleeing the Cyclopes, he oversees the division [edassaf: from dateomai] of the new territory among his fol- lowers (Od. 6.10). Once again, it is the politically powerful king, Nausi? thous, who oversees redistribution. In passing it should be noted that redistribution was so important to the early Greeks that the complex of ideas associated with it was mapped even onto the divine world. We see this in the words daimon and moira. It is most likely that the word daimon is etymologically related to the word daiomai (Chantraine, Dictionnaire s.v. daimon); a daimon is then a partitioner. The concept of moira, often translated as fate, pat- ently has its origin in the distribution of shares, moirai (Chantraine, Dic? tionnaire s.v. meiromai). One of Zeus' major roles, for that matter, is dis- tributor. He is portrayed in the Iliad distributing to men different mixtures of good and evil from two urns that lie on his floor (24.525-33). In Hesiod's Theogony a central act of Zeus in his establishment of the Olympian order is his distribution of powers, for, when the Titanomachy was over, Zeus divided [diedassato] prerogatives among his followers (885). In the Iliad, the distribution [dedastai] by lot of the three parts of the world?the sea, underworld, and sky?among Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades is related (15.189).10 The wording of the scene reminds us of the Greek custom of dividing inheritances by lot (Borecky, "Primitive Ori? gin" 46). Even in the divine paradigm of political action, then, distribu? tion has a central role.u The passage quoted above from the description of Achilles' shield 10Cf. Pind. O. 7.55. nF. M. Cornford (Religion to Philosophy 1-72) presents a fascinating discussion? somewhat tainted by dated anthropological theories?of distribution in the divine realm.</page><page sequence="7">A POLITICS OF EATING 185 uses two words associated with the consumption of food, dais and deip- non. The workmen, we note, are going to have a deipnon. Deipnon oc- curs twelve times in the Iliad and twenty times in the Odyssey. Various derivatives also appear: in the Odyssey, deipneo occurs ten times, deip- nestos once, deipnizo once, and deipnistes once; deipneo occurs once in the Iliad. It describes a meal early (//. 8.53; Od. 9.311,15.397), in the mid- day (Od. 6.97), or late (Od. 4.61) that is taken for alimentary purposes.12 Frequently, as in the case of the workmen on the shield of Achilles who receive a deipnon, it designates the meal of those engaged in hard labor (//. 11.86,23.158, Od. 9.311). Men consume a deipnon before they engage in military activity (//. 2.381,8.53). For that matter, in the scene in which Odysseus advises that the Achaeans eat before going to battle, he wants Achilles to tell them to prepare a deipnon for themselves because of the strengthening powers of food and drink (//. 19.171). Even horses, inas- much as they eat food for alimentation, can have a deipnon (II. 2.383). In contrast to this, the word only once finds itself in the context of the gods' meals: in a concession to anthropomorphism, just as humans who are in- volved in long journeys refresh themselves with a deipnon (Od. 15.77, 500) (e.g., Hermes, after his long flight to Calypso's island, has one [deip- nese] [Od. 5.95]). Deipnon, ariston, and dorpon are the three nounsB in Homer used to designate meals whose principal purpose is nourishment.14 The word u Deipnon is used for an early meal primarily before activities which require much labor (cf. Snell, Lexikon s.v. deipnon). It should be noted that a scholion at Odyssey 4.61 ap- parently displays discomfort at the use of this word for a meal past sunset (Od. 3.497) (Din- dorf, Scholia ad 4.61), a discomfort equally felt by Buchholz in the last century (Das Pri- vatleben 191-93) and S. West today, who suggests the text may be corrupt ("Books I-IV" ad loc). The word is normally used for meals during the day. 13 Buchholz advocates a rather tidy scheme for Homeric meals, with the ariston be? ing an early meal, the deipnon being a midday meal, and the dorpon being a late meal, al? though he allows that at times, when, before a major labor, it is necessary to have a large early meal, the deipnon may supplant the ariston (Das Privatleben 186-94). The scholia present us with contradictory information about the number of meals in the day of a Homeric hero, on one occasion indicating that there were three meals in a day, ariston, deipnon, and dorpon, on another implying there were only two, apparently accepting aris? ton as a synonym for deipnon; the number of meals in Homeric epics was apparently a mat? ter of learned debate, for Athenaeus l.llb-f presents us with conflicting schemes. The is? sues as documented in Athenaeus and the scholia are discussed by Martin Schmidt, Erklarungen 191-96. 14Suzanne Said points out that formulae at Od. 5.95 and 14.111 make it clear that a deipnon "provides a heart with nourishment" ("Les crimes des pretendants" 14).</page><page sequence="8">186 JOHN RUNDIN dorpon15 is used for a late meal (Snell, Lexikon s.v. dorpon).16 It occurs fifteen times in the Iliad and twenty-four times in the Odyssey. The ver? bal derivative dorpeo appears once in the Iliad and four times in the Odyssey; the words metadorpios and potidorpion occur in the Odyssey once and twice respectively. The word ariston, which occurs twice in Ho? mer, describes an early meal whose main point seems to be nourishment (Od. 16.2; //. 24.124; see Snell, Lexikon s.v. ariston). The other word in the passage from the shield, dais, hereafter translated as feast, occurs thirty times17 in the Iliad and fifty-five times in the Odyssey. Its variant daite is used once in the Iliad and three times in the Odyssey, while its variant daitus is used once in the Iliad. The cognate verb, dainumi, "to give a feast," shows up in the active voice three times in the Iliad and twice in the Odyssey. Its middle voice, dainumai, "to par- ticipate in a feast," occurs fifteen times in the Iliad and thirty-seven times in the Odyssey, and the compound metadainumai occurs twice in the Iliad and once in the Odyssey. The word daitumon is employed nine times in the Iliad to denote the participant at a dais. All these words go back to the same root (Chantraine, s. v. daiomai), which denotes division or distribution, as does the previously mentioned daiomai. Accordingly, the word dais in Homer betrays the feast's rootedness in notions of re- distribution (Cf. Said, "Les crimes des pretendants" 14-23). Because re- distribution is a primary expression of political power in the Homeric world and dais clearly signals its connection with distribution, the dais will be the focus of our attention as we explore the politics of eating.18 ^Buchholz, expressing an exceptional view, supplies some evidence that the nomi- native of this word was the masculine *dorpos, which had a neuter plural (Das Privatleben 189-90). 16The same meal is referred to by the words dorpon and deipnon on one occasion (Od. 4.61,4.213), though, as pointed out in note 12 above, commentators express discomfort at this fact. 17Twenty-nine times if we do not accept Zenodotus' reading of daita ioxpasi at Iliad 1.5. See Pfeiffer, History of Classical Scholarship 111-14. 18There are two other rare words that denote what we would call a feast. Eilapine (three occurrences in the Iliad, two in the Odyssey), with its relatives eilapinazo (once in the Iliad, three times in the Odyssey) and eilapinastes (once in the Iliad), is the more com? mon. At //. 10.217, Nestor mentions the dais and the eilapine together in a way that implies some equivalency between the two. Furthermore, at Od. 11.415, the eilapine is described by the word tethaluia, an equivalent of thaleia, which modifies dais on several occasions, and eilapine, like dais, supplies the internal object of the middle voice of dainumi (II 23.201). When Athena asks, "What is the feast [dais], what is the crowd here? Why are you doing this? Is it an eilapine or a wedding?" (Od. 1.225-26), the context implies that an eilapine is</page><page sequence="9">A POLITICS OF EATING 187 In Homer, a feast is a division of consumables, in particular, of meat. The centrality of meat-division to the dais is amply demonstrated by such lines as Od. 17.331-32, "The carver [daitros, also from the same root as daiomai (Chantraine, s. v. daiomai)] used to sit when dividing up [daiomenos] many meats for the suitors feasting [dainumenois] in the hall"; Od. 20.280, "dividing [dassamenoi] the portions [of meat], they feasted [dainunf] a glorious feast [daita]"; and Od. 3.65-66, "When they had roasted the outer flesh and removed it from the fire, dividing it into portions, they had a glorious feast." When Achilles hosts Odysseus, Ajax, and Phoenix as well as when he hosts Priam, the importance of meat di? vision is made clear when the poet tells us that Achilles, not his servants, distributes the meat (//. 9.217,24.626). The humble but honest swineherd Eumaeus supplies us with good confirmation of the ideology of distribu? tion that surrounds the feast. When Eumaeus entertains Odysseus at his hut, after he has slaughtered a pig for a meal, his and his companions' ac? tions are described as follows: The swineherd made a first offering with meat from all the limbs, wrapping it in rich fat. This he threw into the fire, sprinkling it with barley grains. The rest they [the swineherd's associates] cut up and skewered with spits. They carefully roasted it, pulled it off the skewers and threw it all together onto platters. Then the swineherd stood up to carve [daitreuson]: for he had extraordinary knowledge of things which are in due measure [peri... phresin aisima eide]. And carving [da'izon], he divided [diemoirato] it all into seven portions: he put out one for the nymphs and Hermes, son of Maia, praying over it; the rest of the portions he distributed [neimen], one to each man. He honored [gerairen] Odysseus with the long back of the white-tusked pig, and made his master's heart glad. Clever Odysseus ad- dressed him in speech: "I hope that you prove to be as dear to Father Zeus, Eumaeus, as you have become to me since, though I am in such a state, you honored me with favors." (Od. 14.427-41) a particularly large or boisterous dais. Eilapine here, as at //. 18.491 and Od. 11.415, is asso- ciated with a wedding, probably an occasion of special revelry. Telemachus and Penelope, describing the drunken activities of the suitors with the verb eilapinazo (Od. 2.57,17.536), may confirm this impression. Twice (//. 14.241, Od. 17.410) mention is made of a luxury item, a threnus, a footstool for use at the eilapine (Buchholz, Das Privatleben 140-42,146-47). Eranos, which appears twice in the Odyssey is generally accepted to be a feast to which the participants brought contributions (Snell, Lexikon s.v. eranos; Gernet, Anthropology of An? cient Greece 155-59). Athena's questions at Od. 1.225-26 imply that it was of a compara- tively humble nature. (Buchholz, Das Privatleben 194-98, is the source of some of these ar? guments.)</page><page sequence="10">188 JOHN RUNDIN The theme of division and distribution is revealed in this passage by sev? eral words. Two come from the complex of terms associated with daio? mai: daitreuson and daizon. Three come from other roots: diemoirato, neimen, aisima. We are told in this passage that Eumaeus had extraordi- nary knowledge of things which are in accordance with due measure [peri... phresin aisima eide]\ thus he is fit to divide up the carcass of the pig. And he is punctilious in filling this office, carefully dividing the car? cass up to satisfy not only the human participants of the feast but also the invisible divine ones. Beyond its connection with distribution, there are three additional facts about the dais that might encourage us in an exploration of the con? nection between it and politics. The dais involves the division and distri? bution of meat, a substance charged with meaning (Fiddes, Meat). This is just the sort of activity that one might expect to be enmeshed in politics. The Irish Feast of Tara, which was held periodically at the castle of Tara in Medieval Ireland, illustrates this principle. Bruce Lincoln has ana- lyzed a diagram that describes the seating and portions of meat assigned to various guests at the feast and has found that it echoes the social hier- archy. Moreover, he has shown how challenges to the hierarchy were ex- pressed in several Medieval tales as challenges to the seating plan and prescribed distribution of meats at the feast (Discourse 75-88). In an earlier work, Lincoln developed a theory of Indo-European sacrifice. According to his theory, in a ritual that was thought to enact the genesis of the cosmos and society, animals were sacrificed by the Indo-Euro- peans and divided into portions, which, varying in prestige, were distrib- uted to the participants in accordance with social status. Thus the divi? sion of meat mapped out the socio-political structure of society (Myth, Cosmos, and Society). Significantly, the distribution of meat at Greek sacrifices was a matter of much importance in Greek culture, and it re- flected social hierarchies as well (Puttkammer, Quo modo). The second fact is that dais is not generally used in Homer to de- scribe the eating activity of animals (Cf. Ath. 1.12f-13a); rather it is ap- plied to meals eaten by people and gods.19 In fact, the dais is one aspect of a culinary divide that separates humans from the animals, who, as l9Dais is once applied to the activity of animals in a simile wherein Achilles, who persists in desecrating Hector's body, is compared by Apollo to a lion who attacks sheep in order to get a feast (//. 24.43), and probably once again in //. 1.5, where Zenodotus read "and a feast for birds" rather than the more usually printed "and for all the birds" (See Pfeiffer, History of Classical Scholarship 111-14).</page><page sequence="11">A POLITICS OF EATING 189 Hesiod tells us, not being beholden to human law and dike given by Zeus, "eat one another because there is no dike among them" (Op. 276- 79); dike and the dais are things which associate humans with the gods and as such they specify the human animal. In connection with this, it should be noted that at Theogony 535-52 an apparent20 dais between Zeus and men plays an important role in the Prometheus story, a story which has been read as defining the human condition (Vidal-Naquet, "Land and Sacrifice"; Vernant, "At Man's Table" 24). Accordingly, the dais is involved in what it means to be human, and Aristotle's famous po? litical animal is in early epic, to some degree, a feasting animal. Feasting and politics are therefore equivalent terms in defining humanity. A third fact about the dais also encourages the exploration of its connection with politics?women usually have a marginal role in the dais. Although goddesses do take part in feasts,21 mortal women, except as servants, generally do not. In the scene from the shield of Achilles mentioned above, there is no sign that the women will share in the dais. An earlier scene in the shield reinforces this conclusion: at festive gath- erings in the city at peace, women watch the festivities from their thresh- olds (//. 18.496). At one point in the Iliad, Hector mocks Diomedes in battle, saying, "Son of Tydeus, the Danaans of the swift horses used to honor you beyond others with a seat and meats and full cups. Now they will take away that honor. You turned out to be like a woman." (8.161-63) In his mockery, Hector is associating the loss of high position at the feast with the status of being a woman. It is true that two women do make themselves present at feasts in the Odyssey: Helen (4.120-305) and Arete (7.140-347). Arete, though, is certainly anomalous: so untypically gendered is she that, among other things, Odysseus is instructed to sup- plicate her rather than her husband when he arrives at their palace (7.48-77). Moreover, the magical Phaeacians are some what closer to gods than normal humans?the gods actually come to their sacrificial feasts and sit down to dine with them (Od. 7.201-3), so one might expect goddess-Iike behavior from Arete. Helen, too, is anomalous. She is the 20I write "apparent" because it appears as if a dais were being represented here even though the term is not used. Certainly stress is laid on the division of meat, as is evi- denced by the words dassamenos (537) and diedassao (544). 21Goddesses, for instance, are present when the gods gather at the end of Iliad 1 for an event that is twice called a feast (575,602).</page><page sequence="12">190 JOHN RUNDIN daughter of Zeus and, therefore, like Arete, perhaps more answerable to divine than human standards of behavior. Moreover, she has more than a little in common with the hetaira of the later Greek world. Both share a liberated sexuality and the patronage of Aphrodite. And both attend banquets, something which was considered improper for a legitimate wife in the classical period (Keuls, Reign ofthe Phallus 210-15; Murray, "Greek Symposion" 264). The chaste Penelope, in contrast, avoids the suitors feasting in her home. Perhaps, if Penelope had the chance to sit by her husband at a feast as do Helen and Arete, she would. Even so, however, the role of figures like Helen and Arete at the feast is not clear: neither Helen nor Arete reportedly eats or drinks. Moreover, the dais prominently features meat, and, in line with a tendency in many parts of the world to exclude women from access to meat (Adams, Sexual Poli? tics', Fiddes, Meat), meat preparation and consumption is a male activity in Homer. Servant women at the feast are several times shown distribut- ing cereal products (Od. 1.147, 4.55, 7.175, 15.138) but never specifically meat. By and large, then, the feast is an occasion for men in the realm of men. This is significant, for it is now generally accepted that Mediter- ranean communities tend to divide their world into a public and a pri? vate sphere, the private sphere being associated with women, the public one with men (Cohen, Law, Sexuality, and Society 35-51, 70-97). The sphere of men, moreover, is associated with politics, and, accordingly, so is the sphere of the feast. But who will get to eat at the feast whose preparation is described on the shield of Achilles? There are two views on this matter. At first reading, it appears that the deipnon being prepared for the workmen is different from the dais being prepared by the heralds. There is a prob? lem with the word palunon, however. Many modern authorities want palunon to mean "they were strewing" or "they were sprinkling"; ac? cordingly, the women are said to have been strewing (or sprinkling) [palunon] barley as a meal for the workmen. This is a some what puzzling image. Two parallel passages, Od. \A.11 and 14.429, in which Eumaeus palune barley, have been cited as supporting the notion that the barley is being sprinkled on the meat of the ox being prepared by the heralds for the dais,22 the result is that the workmen's deipnon and the dais consti- 22Thalia P. Howe believed that the adduced parallels do not support the belief that the barley is being sprinkled on the meat. She, in contrast, interprets palunon to mean "spread out" or "doled out" and, apparently, maintains a separation between the dais and the deipnon ("Linear B" 47).</page><page sequence="13">A POLITICS OF EATING 191 tute a single event,23 perhaps a community harvest festival (Bruns, Kuch- wesen 56-57). Geoffrey S. Kirk (Homer 12), Malcolm Willcock (Iliad, XIII-XXTV ad toc), Paul Stengel (Opferbrauche 66), and the Ameis- Hentze commentary (Ameis, Ilias ad loc.) offer interpretations in line with the tradition recorded in the scholia, wherein palunon has been glossed with emasson and ephuron (Erbse, Scholia ad loc), and, accord- ingly, the action denoted is the preparation of barley porridge or cakes for the workmen. This interpretation offers, in my opinion, the best solu- tion to the problems that surround this passage, and returns us to the first impression of the passage, whereby the workmen's deipnon, which consists of cereal, is separate from the dais, which is a division of meat. So, if, as conjectured, the workmen are excluded from the dais, and the women are too, who will be hosted at it? One clue might be the pres? ence of the heralds (kerukes) who prepare the ox for consumption after slaughtering it (//. 18.558-59). Heralds in Homer fill a number of official roles within the political sphere (cf. Snell, Lexikon s.v. kerux). It is there? fore quite likely that the feast is being prepared for the entertainment of men who engage in public and political activities. A passage from the Odyssey suggests this interpretation. When Odysseus talks to his mother while consulting with the dead, he inquires whether his office still re- mains in the keeping of Telemachus and Laertes or whether it is in the possession of another on the assumption that he will not return (Od. 11.174-76). Odysseus' mother's response in regard to Telemachus runs: " 'No one yet possesses your exalted office, but Telemachus is in undis- turbed possession of your precincts [temenea] and takes part in the equal feasts which a man who dispenses justice customarily participates in: for he is always being invited to them.' " (Od. 11.184-87) That Odysseus' office has not been lost to another is witnessed by his son's retention of two honors: he has use of Odysseus' precincts [teme? nea], and he participates in feasts. Interestingly, these same two emblems of power occur in the shield scene. The king there is overseeing his precincts, his temenea. He also engages in feasts. The parallel interests of 23Edwards, Iliad ad loc; Leaf and Bayfield, Iliad ad loc; Bruns, Kuchwesen 57. It should be noted in this connection that there are several instances in the Odyssey where the same event is called a deipnon and a dais, three of the most clear examples being the meal mentioned at 17.175 and 17.176; the one at 19.419 and 19.425; and the one at 24.360, 24.384, and 24.386.</page><page sequence="14">192 JOHN RUNDIN these two passages imply that the dais on the shield is being prepared for feasts such as a "man who dispenses justice" attends. An image comes to mind: the men of power in an area invite one another to feasts at which decisions are reached about local issues. The image of the king on the shield, therefore, encodes much important information on Homeric life. The king supervises the collection of wealth in his estate. Some of this wealth is redistributed to those who labor for him. Some of the wealth is siphoned off, however, and used to hold feasts for others of elevated po? litical status. Such an interpretation of the scene recorded on the shield accords with models modern scholars have developed of the society portrayed by Homer.24 According to such models, Homeric society is a weak chief? dom, wherein a man, using his talents at fostering political and economic alliances through gifts and generosity, solidifies his position at the top of a hierarchy. He is then able to tap surplus production of his community to participate in a "prestige economy." A prestige economy is a network of exchange somewhat separate from the subsistence economy that sup? plies the needs of daily life; members of an elite in many societies trans? fer among themselves prestige items, "products which are not necessary for material subsistence, but which are absolutely indispensable for the maintenance of social relations" (Ekholm, "External Exchange" 119), having mobilized the other members of their community to engage in in- tensive production to supply them with such goods.25 The common wis- dom is that, in the Homeric poems, aristocrats give each other items that qualify as prestige items, and take part in a prestige economy.26 The gift-exchange this entails requires the mobilization of the gift-giver's community; we might note how Alcinous mobilizes the people of Phae- acia to support the giving of prestige items to Odysseus (Od. 13.13-15). 24Such models are presented in Quiller, "Dynamics"; Donlan, "Scale, Value, and Function," "The Politics of Generosity," and "Reciprocities in Homer"; and Seaford Reci? procity 1-29. All these scholars owe a great deal to Finley's World of Odysseus. 25Melville J. Herskovits assembles evidence concerning prestige economies in his Economic Anthropology (461-83). His ideas have their roots in the work of Thorstein Veb- len, most famous for his ground-breaking Theory ofthe Leisure Class. H. W. Pearson ("No Surplus" 336-39) touches on the topic. Friedman and Rowlands use the notion of prestige goods in developing a model of the rise of civilization in a very interesting essay, "Notes." 26Finley made this observation, World of Odysseus 120-23. Compare Quiller, "Dy? namics" 127, and Donlan, "Scale, Value and Function" 106-7. In fact, if we examine the evi? dence gathered by Herskovits, Economic Anthropology 461-83, it is remarkable how simi? lar patterns in some of the societies he treats are to Homeric patterns.</page><page sequence="15">A POLITICS OF EATING 193 And while Alcinous is exceptional in the degree to which he can bend the activities of an entire polis to serve his needs, such mobilization of re- sources must occur in any Homeric social unit if its leader is to engage in gift-giving. Nestor surely did not on his own produce the gifts he pre- sents to Telemachus. The process of prestige gift-giving has two political concomitants. One is that a political hierarchy is articulated, with political power accru- ing to a central person who coordinates the gathering of resources to be used as material for the exchanges of prestige items; this is merely a re- statement of the principle discussed earlier, that political power concen- trates at the center of redistributive structures. The other is that alliances and political unions form through the exchange of items between differ? ent agents who are the central coordinators for the gathering of re? sources within their own groups. That this is the case in the Homeric world is proven by the fact that, long after the Homeric poems were transcribed, alliances were still being sealed with xenia, gifts between guest-friends.27 According to Oswyn Murray, the feast is a dominant ele? ment in the network of exchange linking the separate units of Homeric society.28 He has written, "the attracting of support from outside the fam? ily was achieved through displays of generosity, and in particular through the use of surplus agricultural produce for the feasting and entertain- ment of male companions" ("Symposion as Social Organization" 196). It is only to be expected that an individual unit of Homeric society avoids being dominated by another such unit. Such a dominance would express itself in feasting if one unit hosted feasts for the other dispropor- tionately often. Accordingly, there is an emphasis on a balanced reci? procity between those feasting one another; guests at a feast were ex? pected in turn to reciprocate in some fashion. Such notions underlie Telemachus' words to the suitors before the assembly in Odyssey 2: "Leave my house and prepare yourselves other feasts rotating from house to house and eating up your own possessions. But if it seems preferable 27The Spartans and Croesus, for instance, seal an alliance, with oaths "concerning guest-friendship and alliance," with exchange of gifts (Hdt. 1.69-70). This is an extension of what Marshall Sahlins has called "economic diplomacy" (Tribesmen 9-10). Herman (Ritu- alized Friendship) deals with this topic as it affects the ancient Greek world. 28Feasting and gift-giving are primary modes of the prestige economy in the evi? dence assembled by Herskovits, Economic Anthropology 461-83, just as is apparently the case in Homer. Moreover, in Herskovits' examples, honored people are also given honor- ific portions at feasts, just as in Homer.</page><page sequence="16">194 JOHN RUNDIN and better to you that the livelihood of one man be wasted without com- pensation [nepoinon], use it up. I will call on the immortal gods in the hope that Zeus will somehow grant that vengeance [palintita erga] come to pass. Without compensation [nepoinoi] you would then be destroyed in my house!" (139-46) Telemachus' protests here are filled with references to reciprocity con- nected with feasting. He tells the suitors to rotate from house to house and reciprocally feast one another rather than consume the livelihood of one man. His diction also relies on ideas of reciprocity. The word ne- poinos, twice used, carries within it the concept of reciprocal vengeance as do the words palintita erga even more clearly. We might also note that at times the privilege of participation in a feast is used as payment for services; in other words, the feast reciprocates for the gift of a favor.29 Athena's reaction to the suitors' feasting at Odysseus' house may imply that a certain reciprocity is expected in feasting. She comments that their behavior is shameful and it is certainly no eranos that is going on in Telemachus' home (Od. 1.226-29), the eranos being a sort of feast where all bring contributions to the meal (Snell, Lexikon s.v. eranos). This im? plies that the constant consumption of Telemachus' goods with no con? tributions?let alone return?violates standard norms. The balanced reciprocity that ideally characterizes the giving of feasts is no doubt connected with the egalitarian sensibility that under- lies a feast described as a dais eise, an equal feast. In the passage quoted above wherein Odysseus' mother tells him that Telemachus still retains his station, she calls the feasts he attends daites eisas, equal feasts. The ex? pression "equal feast," dais eise occurs eight times in the Iliad and four times in the Odyssey. Modern scholars have reached consensus that the interpretation of eise given by Athenaeus (1.12c), namely, that the word is a by-form of isos, is correct (Chantraine, Dictionnnaire s.v. isos; Frisk, Worterbuch s.v. isos; Snell, Lexikon s.v. isos). Since, among humans in Homer, the dais involves the distribution, in particular, of meat, it is not a great leap of thought to the interpretation offered by Athenaeus, accord- 29Odysseus, pretending to be a Cretan freebooter, tells a fictitious story (Od. 14.244-56) in which, when gathering his comrades for a raiding expedition, he supplies the materials for several days of revelry and feasting; this appears to be recompense for their service. Similarly, Telemachus gives a feast as recompense to those who assist him on his lu- crative trip to the Peloponnesus (Od. 15.506-7).</page><page sequence="17">A POLITICS OF EATING 195 ing to which the phrase dais eise refers to a feast at which the meat is equally distributed (1.12c).30 The feasts explicitly described as equal feasts in Homer are at- tended by high-status people and gods.31 It is therefore probable that the equal feast denotes a feast that involves peers of elevated rank. Sig- nificant support for this point comes from the fact that Homer uses isos in contexts where a lower ranking individual tries to attain equal status to that of a higher individual. Thus, Agamemnon says he will take Briseis from Achilles so that others will not try to speak on equal terms with him (//. 1.187); Zeus claims that Poseidon will not dare to speak on equal terms with him (//. 15.167 [cf. 15.183]); and Apollo warns Diomedes not to have a spirit equal to the gods (//. 5.440-41 [cf. 5.438]). As a neuter sin- gular internal accusative, isos is frequently used with the word tio or a similar expression to mean "honor x in the same degree as y," where "y is of higher status than x" (Snell, Lexikon s.v. isos Blf). Significantly, the words isazo and isopharizo also tend to be used when a lower status in? dividual affects to higher status (Snell, Lexikon s.vv. isazo, isopharizo). Accordingly, there is a tendency to use the word isos to indicate high sta? tus. In this, Greek usage is reminiscent of the English word peer, which on the one hand denotes an equal, but can, in the case of nobility, also be used specifically to denote high ranking individuals who nominally enjoy an equal status. Accordingly, the equal feast instantiates the relations of equal and balanced reciprocity that characterize exchange among those of high status who are, in some sense, not subordinate to one another. There is a problem, however. On one occasion in the Iliad, the Achaeans hold an equal feast, at which Ajax, however, receives a better portion than the rest: "But when they had finished their preparations and had the feast ready, they feasted, and no pleasure was absent from 30 Athenaeus, however, does report the contrary viewpoint of Zenodotus, who inter- preted dais eise as agathe dais. Unfortunately, the reasoning behind his interpretation is quite incomprehensible as transmitted by Athenaeus (12c-13a). 3iSo at //.1.468,1.602, 2.431, 4.48, 7.320, 9.225,15.95, 23.56, and at Od. 8.98,11.185, 19.425. The one possible exception is a meal prepared by Eumaeus the swineherd for Telemachus and the disguised Odysseus (Od. 16.479). Eumaeus, however, is an exceptional person of lower status. Though a swineherd, he was born a prince (15.412-14). He is called a "leader of men" [orchamos andron] (Od. 14.22,121), a title generally reserved for heroes. He also has hetairoi (Od. 14.413,16.84), a term often applied to the companions of men of high rank, and his own servant who serves at meals (Od. 14.449-51). Indeed, the meal he hosts at Od. 14.409-56 is carried out with virtually regal etiquette.</page><page sequence="18">196 JOHN RUNDIN the equal feast: and the heroic son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, honored Ajax with the long back of the ox" (7.319-22). There is a dis- crepancy here between the supposed equality of the feast and this spe- cial portion. One explanation invokes the principle of a "proportional" or "virtual" equality of a "geometric" type (Said, "Pretendants" 18-19; cf. Schmitt Pantel, La cite 477-78, and Nagy, "Theognis" 23, n. 7). This is a sort of equality whereby some are more equal than others; that is, a pro- portionally or virtually equal distribution is a distribution of shares that are not equal in the strict sense we are accustomed to, but rather weighted according to their recipients' varied social statuses.32 This is tantamount to saying that the word isos covers not only the word equal within its semantic field, but also the words equitable and fair (cf. Snell, Lexikon s.v. isos). In any case, this inequality at the equal feast is inter? esting because it reflects some of the major thematic tensions in the Il? iad. The leaders of the Achaeans are all peers?basileis or anaktes. Yet the central conflict in the Iliad between Achilles and Agamemnon in- volves the right of Agamemnon to assert authority over the other lead? ers, particularly Achilles. Thus, there is a destabilizing tension between the equal status of the peers and the elevated status of Agamemnon. There is an analogous tension in the paradox of an equal feast wherein Ajax is unequally honored with a better portion. Moreover, if we do ac- cept that isos can shift between meaning equal and meaning fair, we can see this tension inscribed in the very semantics of epic diction. On two other occasions, heroes are allotted honorific portions at feasts that are not explicitly described as equal feasts. The first case is the passage mentioned above in which Eumaeus takes great care with his carving. In a line virtually identical to those used to describe Agamem- non's honoring of Ajax?only the name of Odysseus has been substi- tuted for that of Ajax?Eumaeus honored [gerairen] Odysseus with a special portion of meat (Od. 14.437). The word gerairen has a relative, the word geras [plural: gera], which is used to denote a portion of honor at a feast. The second example occurs when, at Mycenae, Menelaus gives slices of beef, described as gera, to his guests Telemachus and Peisistratus (Od. 4.66). Originally, this word may have meant privilege of old age. In 32The term "geometric" is being used here anachronistically. While the concept of geometric equality is often loosely applied to pre-Classical phenomena, it specifically refers to theories of proportion that were developed by mathematicians in the Classical pe? riod and perversely applied to political phenomena (See Hardey, "Kinds of Equality").</page><page sequence="19">A POLITICS OF EATING 197 the Homeric poems, however, its applications are many (Snell, Lexikon s.v. geras). It can mean a special portion of spoil given to a king or a chief in a distribution of booty. By extension it came to mean the dignity or honors of a king. His geras, in other words, can serve as a synonym for his office. Accordingly, Odysseus, in a passage we have already looked at, asks his mother whether his son and father are still in possession of his geras. Thus, the feast is clearly pulled into the realm of the political; the geras a participant receives at the feast is a concrete expression of his geras in the political sphere.33 There is apparently an etiquette to the assigning of a portion of meat that serves as a geras: the man who supplies the sacriiicial victim determines who shall receive it. That is true when Menelaus honors Telemachus and Peisistratus, when Eumaeus honors Odysseus, and when Agamemnon honors Ajax. Significantly, when Odysseus, a guest in Phaeacia and not the supplier of the meal, takes it upon himself to give the bard Demodocus a portion of meat to reward him for his song, nei? ther the noun geras nor the verb gerairo is used. It is also made quite clear that the portion Odysseus gives Demodocus comes from the left-overs of the meal (Od. 8.474). A guest, it appears, neither assigns the geras nor determines the initial apportioning of meat. One passage in the Odyssey turns on the notions of the equal feast and the geras. In Odyssey 20, after the slaughter and butchering of a hecatomb, the actions of the suitors and the servants at Odysseus' house are described: And when they had roasted the outer flesh and taken it off the fire, divid- ing the portions, they had a fine feast. The servants put a portion in front of Odysseus, equal to what they themselves received. For that was what Telemachus, the divine Odysseus' dear son, had told them to do. (20.279-83) 33 Said, after examining various ways in which people are honored at the Homeric feast, whether by special wine, portions of meat, or seating, writes in "Les crimes des pre- tendants" 22: Le festin permet, par les exclusions qu'il suppose, de definir une communaute. En meme temps il enonce par toute une serie de signes convergents la hierarchie qui existe entre les membres de cette communaute, car toutes les activites qui se de- roulent dans le cadre du banquet, que ce soit s'asseoir, manger ou boire, finissent par devenir significatives et par temoigner du degre de consideration dont jouit cha- cun.</page><page sequence="20">198 JOHN RUNDIN In the lines that follow the above passage, Ctesippus, a particularly ob- noxious suitor, reacts to the fact that Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, has been given a portion equal to that of the servants. He addresses the rest of the suitors: "Listen to me, brave suitors, so I can get a word in. For some time the stranger has had an equal portion, as he ought. For it is neither good nor just for any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house to go without. Well, let me give him a gift of guest-friendship too, so that he in turn may give the bathman or one of the other servants around Odysseus' house portion of honor [geras]r (20.292-98) With that, Ctesippus throws a hoof, as a gift of guest-friendship, at Odysseus, just missing his head. This mockery of Odysseus turns on no- tions of the equal feast, for it is evoked by the fact that Odysseus has been given an equal portion. Even though the feasting of the suitors in the Odyssey is never described as an equal feast, Telemachus' assign- ment to Odysseus of a portion equal to that given the servants reminds Ctesippus of the equal feast, part of the exchange system of the elite's prestige economy. In his mockery of the disguised Odysseus, he exploits the incongruity involved in the notion that a beggar might engage in such a prestige activity: he sarcastically parodies prestige gift-exchange by giving Odysseus a gift of guest-friendship?in this case, however, the gift is a hoof thrown at his head. Ctesippus has drawn out his joke further by saying that he will give Odysseus the gift so that Odysseus will have a geras to give to one of the servants. The geras, of course, should be as- signed by the host of a feast; in addition, it should be a fine cut of meat, not a hoof. This entire exchange between Ctesippus and Odysseus makes most sense if the equal feast does particularly refer to feasts held among high-ranking peers, for the joke is most biting if it involves a sneering at- tack at the disguised Odysseus' low status. Ctesippus mocks a low-status person, a beggar, by mapping onto him actions appropriate to a high- status person. The equal feast, then, defines a community of high-ranking peers, who are involved in a network of reciprocal exchange, and its partici? pants are bound in a definite social relationship. Thus, when Odysseus entreats Achilles on Agamemnon's behalf to fight once more for the Achaeans, in the very beginning of his speech to Achilles, he states: "Greetings, Achilles. We are not left out of the equal feast either in the shelter of Agamemnon or here now" (//. 9.225-27). To a modern reader</page><page sequence="21">A POLITICS OF EATING 199 it seems a strange way to begin a speech. What Odysseus is saying here, however, is that he and his two companions are peers of both Agamem? non and Achilles, and this is proven by egalitarian commensality with them. Accordingly, they are fit to be neutral mediators in the dispute be? tween the two. The dynamics of feasting in the Homeric poems are now evident. It is apparent that the separate communities of the Homeric world are tied together in a network of exchange, of which a dominant element is feast? ing. Moreover, it is clear that the network relies on the ability of people of high status to appropriate the products of those who are subordinate to them. Why would subordinates tolerate the appropriation of the prod? ucts of their labor? The simplest answer is that in exchange for their spe- cial honors, those of high status offered military services (cf. Finley, World of Odysseus 101; Murray, "Greek Symposion" 260-61). The most succinct statement of this is revealed in Sarpedon's famous speech to Glaucus: "Glaucus, why are we especially honored with a seat and meats and full cups in Lycia? Why does everyone look at us like gods? And why do we own a large precinct [temenos], rich with crops and fertile grain land, by the banks of the River Xanthus? That is why we must take a stand among the first of the Lycians and confront the raging battle, so that one of the thick-armored Lycians can say: 'Truly not without glory are our kings who reign in Lycia, eating fat sheep and choice sweet wine. Equally noble is their valor, for they fight among the first ranks of the Lycians'." (//. 12.310-21) The phrase "a seat and meats and full cups" probably refers here to hon- orific seating and portions at feasts.34 It is probable, then, that some ranking of participants occurs in the feasts to which Sarpedon here refers. The feasts, therefore, are either like the equal feast, mentioned 34It is possible that the phrase does not mean honorific seating and portions, but rather just participation in the feast. As early as the scholia, however, there has been a ten- dency to compare these passages to passages in which honorific portions are mentioned, particularly //. 7.321, where Ajax gets his special portion of meat from Agamemnon, and 4.261-63, where Idomeneus has a perpetually full cup in contrast to the other Achaeans (Erbse, Scholia ad 12.311; cf. Hainsworth, Iliad ad 12.311). The word hedre, which is trans? lated here as seat, is listed in lexicons as also meaning honorific seat (LSJs.v. hedre; Snell, Lexikon s.v. hedre). Said discusses the notion of the seat of honor at a Homeric feast ("Les crimes de pretendants" 21-22).</page><page sequence="22">200 JOHN RUNDIN above, in which Ajax is presented with an honoriflc portion and some al- lowance is made for differences in status, or they are not equal feasts, but rather merely feasts. In any case, we do see here once more the signs of kingly authority which we saw on the shield. Sarpedon mentions both a precinct and feasts, and he connects his and Glaucus' enjoyment of them to their military valor. In Homer, participation in feasts is repeatedly as? sociated with martial effort. Thus, Agamemnon spurs Idomeneus on to valor by mentioning that he receives special privileges at the feasts of the Achaeans (//. 4.257-64). When he sees Odysseus and Menestheus appar? ently holding back from battle, he chides them because they are never slow to answer an invitation to the feast, yet now are slow to join battle (//. 4.327-48). The view expressed in the poems is that warriors deserve special privileges because their military services are so valued by the community.35 Granted that feasting is so involved with politics in the Homeric world, it might be expected that a connection could be demonstrated be? tween feasting and the political institutions represented in the Iliad and the Odyssey. Three of the institutions in question are those that domi- nate much of Greek discussion on politics from early on?the kingship, the council, and the assembly. These three are evident in classical Ath? ens, where there existed a council, an assembly, and a number of magis- trates who stood in place of the king. For that matter, the three are evi? dent in classical Lacedaemon, where there also existed a council, an assembly, and two kings. The universality of this scheme for Greeks is proven by the fact that much Greek political theory is based on it. What might be considered the earliest extant, explicit Greek political theoriz- ing certainly is: namely, the Persian nobles' debate in Herodotus about the best form of government. In this debate are discussed the advantages and disadvantages of monarchic, oligarchic and democratic constitutions (Hdt. 3.80-83). Each of these three constitutions corresponds to the dominance of one of the three elements identified above as typically Greek: the monarchic to the kingship, the oligarchic to the council and the democratic to the assembly. This tradition of political analysis in- 35 So the Homeric poems explain the privileges of high-status men. I am more con- vinced by what might be called the Mafia theory of the emergence of social stratification, according to which stratification emerges when "an industrious but downtrodden peas- antry [is] unable to refuse protection money to a mob of flashily dressed racketeers for fear of having their plough oxen kneecapped, pirogues pirated, and olive trees set in cement overshoes" (paraphrase of Antonio Gilman in Lewthwaite 1981).</page><page sequence="23">A POLITICS OF EATING 201 volving a threefold division of the state into monarchic, oligarchic, and democratic elements continues on in the work of Plato,36 Aristotle (Pol 1279a-b), Polybius (6.3), and others. The three elements are clearly present in the Homeric world (Sealey, History 23). Ithaca clearly has an assembly (Od, 2). It also has a sovereign, although absent, in Odysseus. Troy has a sovereign in Priam; there are signs of a council in the Teichoscopia where Priam is accom- panied by capable "elders of the Trojan people" [demogerontes], who are characterized as the "leaders of the Trojans" [Troon hegetores] (3.146-53). At Phaeacia, there is a monarch Alcinous. There is also a council, which he summons and informs about Odysseus (Od. 8.1-12). We see the three at work in the second book of the Iliad, in which a sov? ereign,37 Agamemnon, called at one point the "most kingly" [basileu- tatos] (9.69), summons a council of advisors [boulen geronton] (2.53) to discuss a plan. The people?in this, as in most cases, synonymous with the army [laoi] (2.86)?are summoned to an assembly [agorende] (2.51), where the plan is presented to them.38 Both in Phaeacia and in the Achaean camp at Troy there is a close connection between the monarch and the elements that make up a coun? cil on the one hand and feasting on the other. This is demonstrated in Il? iad 9, in which, when the siege of Troy is going badly and Agamemnon is in despair and ready to give up, Nestor makes a speech advising Agamemnon to hold a feast for the elders of the Achaeans so they may take counsel about the situation: "Son of Atreus, take charge, for you are the most kingly. Make a feast [dainu daita] for the elders. It is fitting and not out of order. Your shelters are full of wine, which the ships of the Achaeans bring from Thrace daily across the broad sea. You have all the means to offer hospitality, and you rule over many. And of the many men who gather, you will listen to who- ever suggests the best plan." (69-75) 36In Republic 8, Plato identifies five types of constitution: the aristocratic, timocratic, oligarchic, democratic, and tyrannic. Of these five, the first three all involve rule of the few, that is, oligarchy, and therefore it is justifiable to claim that Plato is really just varying the theme of three types of constitutions. 37Of course Agamemnon is not the sovereign in the sense that he rules over the other Achaean leaders as a king; rather, he is the leader of the Achaean expedition. 38Even the gods' government somewhat follows this pattern: Zeus, the sovereign, determines policy with the input of the other gods acting as a council (e.g., //. 4.1-72, 24.22-76).</page><page sequence="24">202 JOHN RUNDIN Nestor's advice is followed: a feast is held, and the decision is reached to supplicate Achilles. In this passage, it is apparent, the councilors of the Achaeans dine together with the sovereign Agamemnon, and the dining society they form acts as the council. This passage is significant, more? over, in that it presents one of five occasions in Homer where the active voice of dainumi is used.39 The active voice of this verb means to give a feast, as opposed to its middle, which means to participate in a feast. Agamemnon's sovereign status among the Greeks at Troy is mapped onto the feast when he is given the responsibility for giving it (as the active voice indicates); he is the redistributor and therefore the leader. Events at Phaeacia confirm the connection between feasting and the king and his council, for at a dais given at his palace, Alcinous states: "Pay attention, leaders and councilors of the Phaeacians, so that I may say what the spirit in my breast bids me. Now that you have feasted, go home to bed. At dawn after summoning the elders in greater numbers we will give hospitality to the stranger in our halls and make fine sacrifices to the gods. Then we will give thought to sending him off so that without toil and discomfort in our escort he will swiftly arrive in good condition in his fa- therland, even though it is quite far away." (Od. 7.186-95) Clearly, the implication is that there is a strong relationship between the members of the council and those who feast with Alcinous, for he states that in the morning he will summon the elders together in greater num? bers than are presently attending the feast. The idea that the aristocratic governing body of a Greek political entity is in some sense a dining soci? ety is further confirmed by the already mentioned statement of Odys? seus' mother that Telemachus "takes part in the equal banquets which a man who dispenses justice customarily participates in." Such banquets probably have the characteristics of a council. Thus, we see a relation between the feast and familiar Greek polit? ical forms like the council and the monarchy. These patterns are clearly present in the Phaeacian episode of the Odyssey. The Phaeacians may not box or wrestle well, but they feast all the time (so Alcinous tells us at 8.248). And they feast so expertly that even the gods attend (7.201-3). This expertise in the feast is supported by the smoothly operating politi? cal and economic system their city enjoys. The Phaeacians, it seems, due 39The other four are at //. 19.299,23.29, Od. 3.309, and 4.3.</page><page sequence="25">A POLITICS OF EATING 203 to their thriving economy,40 are able to live their lives almost totally on the level of the prestige economy. This blessed economy is matched by the blessed politics of Phaeacia. We note how easily the sovereign Alci- nous on one occasion gets his fellow noble Phaeacians to give Odysseus gifts (8.389-95); on another he is able to requisition from each of those who drinks and listens to singers with him a cauldron and a tripod for presentation to Odysseus. Each of those who gives such costly gifts of metal, Alcinous says, should recover the cost from the people (13.13-15). Supported by the rich economy and smoothly-functioning political ap- paratus of Phaeacia, he is easily able to strengthen ties of guest-friend- ship with Odysseus, in effect making an alliance with Ithaca, where Odysseus is sovereign. This is a good occasion to return briefly to consideration of the Cy- clopes, the Phaeacians' relatives?both groups are descended from Po- seidon?who stand in obvious contrast to them. In the Odyssey, Odys? seus describes his arrival to the Cyclopes' land: "And we arrived in the land of the lawless [athemiston] and arrogant Cy? clopes. Putting their faith in the gods they neither labor to grow plants nor plow since without sowing or plowing everything grows: wheat, barley, and vines, which produce wine from their thick bunches of grapes, for Zeus' rain makes them grow for the Cyclopes. They have neither political assem- blies [agorai boulephoroi] nor laws [themistes], and they inhabit the peaks of tail mountains in spacious caves. Each makes the law for his children and wives, and they do not care for one another [allelon alegousiri]." (9.106-15) The word lawless [athemiston] and the fact that they neither have politi? cal assemblies [agorai boulephoroi] and laws [themistes] nor care for one ^Some advantages in trade no doubt lie in having ships that are so fast as to make the journey from Scheria to Ithaca in a night (Od. 13.70-95) and through some bizarre autopilot mechanism do not require pilots and steersmen (Od. 8.557-63). Other sectors of the Phaeacian economy prosper equally. The women Odysseus sees as he enters Alcinous' house, who are reported to be no less talented in domestic matters than the men are in nau- tical ones, are engaged in a veritable frenzy of production: grinding grain, weaving, spin- ning (Od. 7.103-11). The agricultural plants on Alcinous' state are equally over-achievers. Not content with a single harvest season, they yield produce year round (Od. 7.115-28). The net result of this is summed up in the observation that, because they have unfailing sup? plies, the Phaeacians like to sit around on expensive coverlets eating and drinking (Od. 7.95-99).</page><page sequence="26">204 JOHN RUNDIN another [allelon alegousin] clearly suggest a lack of political order, which is connected with equal incompetence in matters of eating and guest- friendship. Polyphemus is so clumsy in these matters that his idea of a gift of guest-friendship for Odysseus is to eat him last (9.369-70). Finally, in our examination of the political aspects of the feast, we should note that it is a major setting for the propagation of the dominant ideology. In accordance with the views of Sahlins, political power in the Homeric world is associated with the ability to mobilize production. There are two major causes for which production is mobilized in it: war and the giving of gifts in the context of guest-friendship. The political elite of the Homeric world therefore relies on the perpetuation of these two institutions. We have already seen one way in which the feast en- courages military activity: namely, the assigning of honorific portions to warriors of valor. But there was another way as well: through the musical performances that typically accompany feasting. Homeric epic on one occasion declares the phorminx to be the companion of the feast (Od. 17.271). Poetry like the Iliad and the Odyssey is perf ormed in the Home? ric world: we need only note the performances of Demodocus and Phe- mius and the songs being sung by Achilles in Iliad 9. If we are allowed to assume that the poetry of the Homeric world is thematically similar to the Iliad and the Odyssey, we must grant that it encouraged both ex? change and war. The Iliad is obviously a poem that supports war as an appropriate activity for a man of honor.41 The Odyssey, which has been 41 To quote Seth Schein, "In the world of the poem, war is the medium of human ex? istence and achievement; bravery and excellence in battle win honor and glory and thus en- dow life with meaning. Heroes affirm their greatness by the brilliance and efficiency with which they kill. The flashing action of a warrior's triumph represents the fullest realization of human potential, despite the pain and loss for the victim, his family, and his community. And even for the victim, death that 'yields glory to another' (12.328,13.327) can be more than simply pain and loss. Some glory can be won, too, by dying bravely, in an act that sums up and puts a seal on a life lived in accordance with the generally acknowledged standards of heroic 'excellence' (arete). Thus when Hector realizes that Athena has tricked him and that he is about to die at Achilles' hands, he says, 'At least let me not perish without a strug? gle, ingloriously, / but after having done something great, for future generations to learn of (22.304-5)" (Mortal Hero 68). Hector's last plea mentioned by Schein here is a wish to be commemorated in the epic poetry that was recited at feasts. He wishes not to die without kleos, glory. Gregory Nagy has pointed out that the word kleos etymologically should mean simply "that which is heard." But since it is the poet who gives a hearing to the deeds of men, the poet is in a privileged position to bestow the reward of kleos, being heard of. "Po? etry confers glory. The conceit of Homeric poetry is that even a Trojan warrior will fight and die in pursuit of kleos... Achaion 'the kleos of the Achaeans' (XI227). If you perform heroic deeds, you have a chance of getting into Achaean epic" (Best of the Achaeans 16-17). Poetry, accordingly, encourages martial efforts.</page><page sequence="27">A POLITICS OF EATING 205 demonstrated to be complementary to the Iliad in theme,42 picks up the other of the two activities mentioned above: exchange, for it has as a cen? tral and obsessive theme guest-friendship. Accordingly, the musical per? formances that are part of the feast again form part of the political appa- ratus of the Homeric world. To sum up, we can trace a connection between Homeric politics and the Homeric feast. For one thing, the politically powerful of the Ho? meric world are marked out by their relationship to the feast. For they, being the centers of a redistributive economic order, control feasting inasmuch as it is a redistributive activity. In addition, relations between different members of the politically powerful class are articulated by the feast, for in the notion of the equal feast, and in the reciprocity implicit in general in feasting activity, an egalitarian political order is established linking together those who are themselves the centers of redistributive activity. Moreover, a strong relationship unites feasting with the council and the king. COMMON MEALS AFTER HOMER The modes of thought in Homer concerning feasting did not die out after his period. Rather, we find them reflected in both political insti? tutions and theory in later Greek culture. There are numerous inter- related43 commensal institutions from later Greece that also relate to the dais in one way or another. A continuity, for instance, between the dais and the symposium has been detected (Murray, "Greek Symposion"). One might also choose to examine the connection between the dais, which involves the eating of a sacrificed animal, and the sacrificial ban- quet of later Greek society. The focus of our attention, however, as we trace the notions that surround the dais will be the sussition, the com- 42It has long been noted that the two poems do not both contain a description of the same action, even though they both deal with the Trojan War. They appear to steer clear of each other's material (Nagy, Best of the Achaeans 20-21). We might also note how the two heroes of the epics contrast with and complement each other. Achilles, who hates like the gates of hell the man who hides one thing in his heart and says another (//. 9.312-13) is a suitable foil to the ever-lying Odysseus. 43 In regard to Archaic Greece, it has been traditional to oppose the notion of a sac- rificial banquet, where meat is the focus of the occasion, and the symposium, where wine is. Schmitt Pantel has shown that such a schematic opposition is not the only way to interpret the actual evidence from the archaic city. She likes to speak of "rituals of conviviality" that include symposia, sacrificial meals and other such occasions ("Sacrificial Meal"; cf. La cite 4,17-52,484).</page><page sequence="28">206 JOHN RUNDIN mon mess as known from Sparta and Crete, for it most obviously con- nects the political order with eating, and, in fact, the sussition can be said to be part of the constitution of those states that maintained them (Schmitt Pantel, La cite 484). Moreover, the sussitia of Sparta and Crete are claimed to have enforced an equality among participants that is rem- iniscent of the equal feast. Sparta supplies us with the most well-known example, but it was not, it should be noted, unique in the Greek world. The Spartan state or, at least, its image had a strong influence on later Greek political thought (Ollier, Mirage). This being true, it is not surpris- ing that common messes appear as part of the plan for an ideal state in Plato's Republic and his Laws, thus finding a place in Greek political the? ory. The Spartan common messes are the best known sussitia. The Spar? tans were the elite of a social system that arose after a long period of strife (Hdt. 1.65). In many places in the Greek world, the social convul- sions of the archaic period resulted in the rise of tyrannies. The Spartans' solution was not tyranny but rather their peculiar government. Calling themselves homoioi, peers, and thereby emphasizing their desire to maintain at least nominal equality within their ranks, they developed in? stitutions which were directed towards fostering solidarity, warding off tyranny, and alleviating tensions between haves and have-nots. Each Spartan, for instance, was allotted a portion of land (Plut. Lyc. 8,16),44 and there was a ban on the possession of precious metals (Plut. Lyc. 9; Xen. Resp. Lac. 7.6). Educational institutions also encouraged solidarity. At a certain age, Spartan boys joined groups, in which they lived under the same conditions (Plut. Lyc. 16.4).45 There they were under the direc- tion of a state official (Plut. Lyc. 17; Xen. Resp. Lac. 2.2). There can be no doubt that the purpose of such an institution was to foster ties between the Spartans by encouraging state-sanctioned relationships.46 The com- 44This is not to say, however, that all Spartans had equal land-holdings. Polybius be- lieved so (Poly. 6.45-46), citing many authorities, yet there is too much evidence of land- rich and land-poor Spartans to accept this contention. See Michell (Sparta 207). 45The details of this system are much debated. K. M.T Chrimes surveys discussions of it (Ancient Sparta 84-136). 46As Finley puts it while discussing Sparta, "any device which cuts across a 'natural' grouping, whether family or age-class, can be seen as one more way of strengthening the structure of the whole against the part" (Use andAbuse 166).</page><page sequence="29">A POLITICS OF EATING 207 mon mess was another such institution.47 Every adult male citizen joined one at maturity and had to eat a common meal with his messmates every day (Plut. Lyc. 12). He also had to contribute a certain amount to his mess's common store. If he could not contribute his share, he lost his place in it, which was tantamount to losing full citizenship (Arist. Pol. 1271a). The connections between the Spartan messes and the Homeric dais are immediately evident. The equal feast of Homer, which defined an upper social stratum, is very close in effect to the Spartan common meals. The Spartans formed an elite, and membership in that elite was dependent on membership in a mess. The strong emphasis on equality in the equal feast is paralleled in the Spartan institution. We have already noted the Spartan emphasis on equality, reflected in their appellation, the peers. Plutarch thought that the common messes were meant to maintain an equality of consumption among the peers (Lyc. 10). Long before Plutarch, Xenophon subscribed to the same view (Resp. Lac. 1). Aristotle, in criticizing the organization of the Spartan messes, says that they should be provisioned at public expense, rather than by the manda- tory contributions of members because that means that both rich and poor have to pay equally, and the poor become impoverished. This is contrary to the intentions of the law-giver who created them, Aristotle claims, since he wanted them to be democratic (Pol. 1271a). Obviously, Aristotle sees as one of their major purposes the fostering of social equality through the equal distribution of food. This enforced equality is obviously similar to the equality of the equal feast. 47 A. Bielschowsky has assembled the ancient evidence on the Spartan common messes (Syssitiis). They are often called sussitia, which is a word Greeks applied to such in? stitutions throughout the known world. The earliest term for the Spartan institution in par? ticular may be andreion (Alcman apud Strabonem 10.4.18; Arist. Pol 1272a). In later peri- ods, they are frequently referred to as pheiditia (or phiditia; some manuscript evidence indicates the proper reading is philitia), and Bielschowsky claims that, in general, this word was used by the ancients to refer to the Spartan messes and no others. Xenophon, however, consistently refers to them as suskenia, tent-fellowships (Resp. Lac). (Evidence for the names applied to the Spartan messes is gathered at Bielschowsky, Syssitiis 9-13.) Plutarch tells us that a sussition consisted of about 15 men (Lyc 12); Bielschowsky believes this is consistent with other evidence (Syssitiis 15). W. G. Forrest, while advancing a highly specu- lative model for Spartan social organization, has suggested that as many as three hundred men formed one mess (History 45-46). However, if we grant that Xenophon knew what he was saying when he called the messes tent-fellowships, and their participants suskenoi, tent-fellows, we would have to allow for extremely large tents to accommodate 300 men.</page><page sequence="30">208 JOHN RUNDIN There was not, however, total equality of contributions and por? tions at the messes. The standard fare might be supplemented by extra contributions from the rich (Xen. Resp. Lac. 5). And just as the assign- ment of honorific portions was an element of Homeric feasting etiquette, it is also found in the Spartan mess. The kings were given a double ration (Hdt. 6.57), so that they might give the extra portion to valorous individ? uals (Xen. Resp. Lac. 15). The parallel here with the behavior of Mene? laus in the Odyssey is striking; he, of course, presented his honored guests Telemachus and Peisistratus with portions of meat that he was given as honorific portions (4.66). In this connection we should not fail to mention the Spartan office of kreodaites, meat-divider or carver. The term is mysterious but could be the name of the person in charge of a mess (Nilsson, "Grundlagen" 317). If so, the -daites element in it demon- strates a connection between Spartan messes and the redistributive no- tions implicit in the words related to daiomai in the Homeric poems. There is a chance that this official is the same as the Spartan mageiros mentioned at Herodotus 6.60, whose office is said to be hereditary. If this is the case, the hereditary nature of his position underlines its impor? tance. It may have been his job to supervise the politically-charged dis? tribution of meat. In any case, it is clear that the politics of correct food distribution was alive and well in the Spartan tradition. The connection of music with feasting in the Homeric poems was pointed out above. Much music was associated in the Homeric poems with praise of notable deeds, in line with a general Indo-European tradi? tion (Nagy, Best of the Achaeans 222-52). Interestingly, if we are to trust Xenophon, the participants in the Spartan mess devoted much attention to the praise of noble accomplishments (Resp. Lac. 5.6). The continuity between Homeric attitudes towards eating and the ethos that underlay the Spartan messes is remarkable. The Spartan messes, however, were not unique in the world. Aristotle remarks that the sussition is an ancient institution, and his comments on its origins im- ply that it was a regular feature of Greek polities (Pol 1329b). We have record of such institutions from several parts of the Greek world. There is some evidence that they were known by the Megarian poet Theognis (Theog. 309). Michell has taken this as evidence that they existed at Megara (Sparta 286). We also have testimony that some such institution existed at Thebes.48 Diodorus Siculus tells us that Ionian refugees from 48Polyaenus 2.3.11, Plato Legg. 636, where Boeotian messes are mentioned.</page><page sequence="31">A POLITICS OF EATING 209 Asia, settling on Lipara and pressed by Etruscan piracy, set up a commu- nist state, apparently to facilitate defense, in which the people lived in arrangements based on messes (kata sussitia, 5.9.4). On Plato's authority we have it that there were common messes at Miletus and Thurii (Legg. 636). Even democratic Athens had institutions which appear to be re? lated (cf. Schmitt Pantel, La cite 485-87). We note that the standing members of fifth-century b.c. Athens' Council, which seems to have taken over the probouletic functions of the traditional aristocratic coun? cil, engage in common meals (Arist. Ath. Pol. 43.3).49 If we may venture out of the Greek world, Aristotle tells us that the Oenotrians from early times clear down to his day had messes (Pol. 1329b), and the Carthagini- ans as well (Pol. 1272b). The ones we know most about, however, are from Crete. A rela- tively detailed glimpse into the meals held in a system of public messes comes from a passage in Athenaeus, who cites as his sources Dosiadas and Pyrgion (4.143a-f). Dosiadas' account reveals several features of in- terest to us. He tells us that, at the Cretan Lyttians' public meals, which were provisioned through a tax on each man and an allocation of public funds, equal portions were given to participants,50 although the younger received only half a portion. Moreover, honorific portions went to those who had distinguished themselves in war or wisdom. Thus we see the same pattern we noted at Sparta and in Homer?an equal feast, which, however, allows for special treatment of honored participants. Dosiadas also tells us that after the meal there was talk about state matters, fol- lowed by recollection of deeds of war and praise of men who have shown bravery; again, then, we see praise at a common meal. Such messes as the Cretans and the Spartans maintained, in at least the idealized forms in which they became known, were quite influential in Greek political theory. We may see evidence of this influence in the es- tablishment of Thurii in the fifth century b.c. After the people of Croton destroyed Sybaris, the remaining Sybarites reestablished the city with 49Cf. Schmitt Pantel's comparison, La cite 485-87. 50 Aristotle praises the Cretan institution for making good some of the deficits of the Spartan one; the Cretan system, he maintains, is better because it is more communist; while each Spartan must pay a fixed tax to maintain his place in the messes and his citizenship, in Crete a public fund supported them. Thus, the problems that the Spartans experienced due to certain men's inability to pay their mess dues and, indeed, the injustice that the poor and the rich paid the same amount was obviated (Pol. 1272a). Strabo reports Ephorus' account of the Cretan messes, in which the equality fostered by them is emphasized (10.4.16-20).</page><page sequence="32">210 JOHN RUNDIN the help of the Athenians. The accounts we have are confused,51 but in- teresting traditions about the refounded city survive. Thurii, as it was called, was founded under the influence of contemporary political the? ory. The town's geometrically regular layout (Diod. Sie. 12.10.7) may re- flect the town-planning theories of Hippodamus (Arist. Pol. 1267b), who is said to have taken part in its settlement (Hesychius s.v. Hippodamos). Diogenes Laertius records that Protagoras participated in writing its laws (9.50). We are told that other thinkers of the time participated in the foundation as well: Herodotus is supposed to have settled there,52 as did the two Sophists Euthydemus and Dionysodorus (Pl. Euthd. 271b-c). Diodorus Siculus reports on certain aspects of the constitution established there, and among other features we find provisions for uni- versal education (12.12.4). In short, there is evidence that Thurii's foun? dation was influenced by the intellectual currents of the time. In particu? lar, the participation of Hippodamus?in Aristotle's words, the first man not actively engaged in politics to talk of the best sort of constitution (Arist. Pol. 1267b)?and Protagoras speaks to us of what might almost be called a sophistic social experiment. It is probably no coincidence that sussitia were established at Thurii, according to Plato, and it is likely that they were part of the experiment. Ironically, Thurii was constantly beset by strife from its very foundation, and Plato blames the messes (Legg. 636). This fondness for messes among intellectuals did not die out with the sophists. The tradition that we have of the Spartan messes, of course, largely stems from authors like Xenophon or Plutarch, who are setting up the Spartan state as a model of good government. Those who went beyond the description of existing states like Sparta and who chose to describe ideal states also were fascinated by messes. The ideal state con- structed in Plato's Republic, of course, has institutionalized messes; the guardians were to hold property in common and eat in messes (416e, 458c). Even the less extreme state Plato constructs in his Laws has them (780a-81d, 783b-c, 842b). Aristotle advocates the establishment of messes in his own version of the ideal state; he even says he will give his reasons for this (Pol. 1330a)?unfortunately, he never fulfills this prom- 51 See Erhrenberg, "Foundation" and Freeman, "Thourioi" for general accounts of its foundation. 52Ehrenberg ("Foundation" 170, n. 67) agrees with the earlier assessment of F. Ja- coby that the belief that Herodotus settled at Thurii stems from the alternate reading of the first line of his Histories, which states he is of Thurii, not Halicarnassus.</page><page sequence="33">A POLITICS OF EATING 211 ise. His concern for their proper institution is evidenced, however, by the way in which he dictates the proper positioning of mess-halls through- out his state (Pol. 1331 a-b). It is apparent, then, that patterns that we find in the Homeric world survive both in the thought of Greeks after the time the Homeric poems were written down and in their institutions. We see in particular a contin- uing obsession with equality in eating. This is not to argue for the belief that Greeks after Homer were irrationally emulating the institutions represented in Homer. One might indeed wonder whether the Spartan mess or, at least, the representation that has come down to us of it, was modeled on Homeric precedent. It is possible that the idea of common meals, particularly ones wherein the principle of equality is at least nom- inally respected, was a common cultural heritage that expressed itself in the Homeric poems as well as the Spartan messes. It would have sur- vived so well because it addressed the deep anxieties of many of the di- verse communities that made up the Greek world. Given the competi- tive, fractious and stasis-fSled record of Greek history from the archaic through the classical era, it is not unreasonable to imagine that common meals were thought to foster solidarity and prevent social strife among those with a claim on political power.
