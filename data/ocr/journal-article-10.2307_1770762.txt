<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS METAMORPHOSIS: THE MIND IN EXILE. By Harold Skulsky. Cambridge, Mass., and London: Harvard University Press, 1981. 244 p. Literary studies in recent years have been making an increasingly large and significant place for thematics. No other single theme could respond more richly to this approach than metamorphosis, Ovid's treatment of which must alone have provided more themes for future poets than any other single work. Science, with Darwinian evolution, has registered the changes leading up to the human condi- tion; philosophy, from Heraclitus to Bergson, has emphasized the flux of ever- changing phenomena. "Everything is in a state of metamorphosis," said Marcus Aurelius. The most persistent fact of life, for the Renaissance, was what it per- ceived as vicissitude or mutability. Harold Skulsky has therefore directed his attention and ours to a major subject, and he has chronologically chosen his ten examples well. Given its pervasiveness, he has had to be carefully selective. Addi- tional or alternate choices for study might have proved to be equally interesting: the Grimms' Household Tales, Alice in Wonderland, the Proteus episode of Ulysses, or-to range beyond western tradition-The Arabian Nights. But the present florilege can be accepted as central and representative beyond dispute. Since there have been only a few precursors, further researchers may now be expected to extend the inquiry and to fill it in. It is good to know that Henry Hatfield has been completing a monograph on the Walpurgisnacht, which should demonstrate how far even Goethe stood from exhausting that closely related conception. Given the wide-ranging nature of the available material, posing a continual temptation to digress, Professor Skulsky has also had to delimit his focus. The jacket of the book states that it has succeeded in "fusing the methods of compara- tive literature, intellectual history, and philosophical analysis." Comparatists may find that the last two interests have been accorded priority over the first. The notes refer to articles from The Australasian Journal of Philosophy but not to the Motif- Index of Folk-Literature, albeit Stith Thompson's monumental compilation offers literally hundreds of analogues for the matter at hand. Skulsky spells out his premises in an introduction, "The Problem and the Method," and heralds his definitions in his general subtitle. He seems to regard "the fantasy of transforma- tion" as a kind of test case for the mind-body problem. In describing particular selves who retain their identity throughout a transmutation of physical forms, his authors-as he interprets them-affirm "the autonomy of the mental." His most adoptable model in this respect is The Golden Ass, to which the longest chapter has been devoted. As a first-person narrative, it is identified with the subjective consciousness of its transformed protagonist. Lucius is one of those to whom mis- adventures happen; but, unlike his Ovidian counterparts, he learns something from his metamorphic experience; and along the way a picaresque novel turns into a Bildungsroman. Satire combines with mystery, in Skulsky's terms; a bawdy Milesian story culminates with an initiation into the rites of Isis. Indeed this fiction is extra- ordinary to the point of uniqueness, and thus can hardly serve as a paradigm for 171</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE all the others. When Bottom the Weaver goes through a similar transmogrifica- tion, it will be viewed from the outside. When a frog is revealed as a fairy-tale prince, we watch through the unchanging heroine's eyes. Sometimes, it is conceded, "the riddle of Mind ... shades into that of the Other"-as it does when the psyche of Poe's Ligeia takes possession of his Lady Rowena. In the first situation con- sidered here, wherein the crew of Odysseus gets metamorphosed into swine, he himself remains the unaffected observer and the objective narrator. We are reminded that the effects of Circe's enchantment can be most easily glossed as a moral allegory. The reduction of man to bestiality reverses the anthropomorphic transpositions of the beast fable. Humans are likened to animals for their swinish gluttony, asinine stupidity, wolfish ferocity, or serpentine malignity. One of these chapters, dealing with Marie de France's lai about a werewolf, presents lycan- thropy as a metaphor of alienation from humanity. Another deals with Keats's Lamia, where the belle dame sans merci is reduced to the lowest and subtlest of beasts. Most of the changelings turn out to be more like natural fauna than fabu- lous monsters. The passage from the Odyssey is the principal source of an important epic motif: the dalliance with the temptress and the escape from her sorcery. Con- sequently Homer's Circe could have furnished a basis of fruitful comparison with Ariosto's Alcina, Tasso's Armida, and Spenser's Acrasia. Moreover, though Plutarch is cited in another and more recondite connection, no mention is made of his highly pertinent monologue Gryllus. There an obstinate changeling refuses to be disenchanted from Circe's spell. During the sixteenth century his naturalistic argument for the superiority of the animal condition was augmented and elab- orated into ten dialogues by the Florentine academician, G. B. Gelli. "Grill" reappears to speak his "hoggish mind" when the Bower of Bliss is demolished at the end of Book II in The Faerie Queene. The chapter on Spenser is the shortest and slightest-six pages, one of them an extended quotation. It concentrates upon the uncharacteristic fabliau of Malbecco, Paridell, and Hellenore in Book III, without pausing to point out its implicit travesty of the Trojan myth. Spenser's final comment is that the resentful cuckold "has quight / Forgot he was a man, and Geolosie is hight." This does not say he ceased to be a man; it tells us that he has been dubbed "Jealousy." The personification constitutes little more than a rhetorical facon de parler. Yet, for Skulsky, the abstraction brings about an apotheosis, elevating a serio-comic figure to a plane of sublimity. Most of these studies center on specific passages. Ovid's Metamorphoses (entitled Transformatio in his day) is approached more broadly. So it should be, as the grand compendium of loci classici, touching upon some 250 myths. Skulsky follows Brooks Otis far enough at least to call it an epic, while recog- nizing in its sophistication a parody of the traditional genre. Though the example set by Jove's transformations might almost make him the hero, he is a deus absconditus in this discussion. That absence is underlined by a cross-reference to Plautine comedy, which instances the role of Mercury as Sosia but ignores the role of Jupiter as Amphitryon. A tense incongruity is discerned between the world order of imperial Rome and the cosmic absurdism of the Olympian pantheon. To justify the ways of Augustus Caesar by the unbridled behavior of the Roman gods might well lead to "metaphysical doubt." Skulsky is especially skeptical toward Ovid's philosophical spokesman, Pythagoras, whose doctrines are dismissed as mere harlequinades. Certainly he does not inform the poem with the cogency and coherence that Epicurus confers on De Rerum Naturae. The concept of permuta- tion, as Skulsky is well aware, does not readily lend itself to a "synoptic vision" 172</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS like that of Lucretius. It is more compatible with a sequence of stories than with a panorama of the universe. The polar opposite of the Metamorphoses will be the fixed framework of The Divine Comedy. Dante is represented by two delegations from the Inferno, where it could be expected that individuals would undergo serious alteration: the suicides in Canto XIII and the thieves in Cantos XXIV and XXV. Since they have already become shades in an afterworld, their physical embodiment raises some problematic theological questions. The suicide Piero delle Vigne has taken the form of a branch, which bleeds and speaks when it is broken off. It is Virgil himself who recalls the uncredited precedent of Polydorus, dead but still to be properly buried in the Aeneid. The thief Vanni Fucci, harassed by serpents that burn and revive like the Phoenix, condemns himself as a beast for his "vita bestial... e non humana." When some of his fellow sinners are transmuted, Dante himself invokes both Ovid and Lucan, and goes on to claim that his narration has surpassed the horror of its classical prototypes, inasmuch as his reptilian creatures have exchanged shapes with their victims. Dante claims to have witnessed what his forerunners have feigned, Skulsky adds; but, of course, such claims are equally fictitious. He consults patristic and Thomistic authorities on the nice points of eschatology. Yet, though he cites the text when it alludes-thematically and rather self-con- sciously-to other literary texts, he does not pursue those suggestive allusions. Consequently he does not convey that sense of Dante's intertextuality which Karl Vossler did so much to illustrate. The selection from Donne is his long satirical fragment Metempsychosis, that "sullen writ" whose teasing obscurities have fostered reciprocal qualities among its interpreters. With metempsychosis, death and rebirth become agents of meta- morphosis. This particular transmigration carries the spirit of heresy from Eve's original apple through a series of bestial incarnations to her daughter, the sister and wife of Cain. If the misogynistic satirist had wished to carry on the progression until it reached the soul of Queen Elizabeth, he was prudent to abort it there. The contemporary account of his intentions, Ben Jonson's Con- versations with William Drummond, testifies that his ultimate avatar would have been John Calvin. There is likewise a dialogue in Volpone, between the dwarf and the hermaphrodite, which burlesques Donne by transmigrating from Pythag- oras to a Puritan. But Jonson's first-hand testimony is not discussed, except for a marginal reference to the scatological "Famous Voyage." Instead, there are frequent appeals from the Pythagorean scheme of things to extraneous meta- physicians and theologians, whose orthodoxy has little in common with the ethical relativism of Donne's abrupt tag lines. Turning to Lamia, Skulsky convincingly suggests that there is no use explaining the inexplicable, that poetry is less con- cerned with pat solutions than with open-ended speculations, that his diverse metamorphoses are all compounded from the illusory stuff of dreams. Retrospect looks back from the twentieth century, with Virginia Woolf's Orlando. Skulsky seems warranted in conceiving its historical and transsexual shifts as "possible worlds": changed circumstances and projected responses to them. We know the aim was to paint a spiritual portrait of Victoria Sackville- West, who figures in both the dedication and the illustrations. Skulsky does not name her, and takes no advantage of all the current documentation from Blooms- bury. Rather, he reads the free biographical fantasia as if it were a rejoinder to the epistemological realism of G. E. Moore on behalf of what is called "phenom- enalism." Virginia Woolf did not think in such categories, and her writing can be more clearly explicated onthe stylistic level of impressionism. As for Kafka's 173</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Verwandlung, it must necessarily be a keystone for studies in this field-which increases the difficulty of contributing anything in the way of new insights into it. Skulsky's variation on the familiar theme is to take issue with the Freudianism of Walter Sokel's interpretation. But why does he assume that Gregor Samsa be- came a beetle ? Others have assumed that it was a cockroach. It is true that the vituperative charwoman addresses him as "dung-beetle" (Mistkdfer), an epithet which has an Aristophanic pedigree. Kafka has deliberately used the unspecific term "insect" (Ungeziefer), with a vagueness that adds to the uncertainty of Gregor's predicament. Generally speaking, Skulsky's translations are conscientious and readable. Perhaps his publisher should share the blame for the tantalizing inadequacy of the index. He himself deserves much credit for singling out and grappling with so extensive and many-sided a subject. To this undertaking he has obviously devoted a great deal of reading, thought, and labor; and those components have not always been smoothly assimilated into the style. However, he is less committed to aesthetics than to ideas, which he has pursued with zeal and entertained with ingenuity. His chapters tend to be philosophic commentaries rather than critical interpretations, taking the object at hand as a point of departure rather than moving toward an artistic core, tending to argue about it with other commentators in a tone which may verge at times upon the Scholastic, if not the Talmudic. Yet Ovid's myths have proved so enduring precisely because they have possessed an endless capacity for being, not simply retold, but moralises. Skulsky does not offer a formal conclusion, nor does he interlink the works he studies by tracing lines of continuity or development. These may not be clearly appreciable: "plus ?a change, plus c'est la meme chose." The weary epigram of Alphonse Karr is countered by the Pre-Socratic maxim: nothing is permanent save change. Whether we emphasize the universality or the particulars, the fascination lies in their con- tinual interplay: the metamorphoses of metamorphosis. HARRY LEVIN Harvard University</page></plain_text>
