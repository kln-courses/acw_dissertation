It has been reviewed in the Indo-Iranian Journal, volume X, no 1 (1967). The book which is under review now is a sequel to the other one, and it will probably be followed by some more volumes dealing with the same subject: religion of Bali. Sürya-Sevana, Sun Worship, is the name of the principal rite of the pëdandas, the (mostly) Shivaite brahmin priests of Bali. It is, in a simple form, performed daily in the priestly manses, called griyas (Sanskrit grha). More elaborate rites of the same character belong to the periodical festivals cele brated in the numerous Balinese temples. Dancing, music, theatricals and offerings are the most prominent features of the temple worship, however. Cremation ceremo nies occupy an important place in the social and religious life of the Balinese. Pëdandas performing rites of the Sürya-Sevana type are usually asked to grace these ceremonies with their presence, but the other features, such as gorgeous pageants and merry making, attract far more attention of the public attending a cremation than the mysterious rites of the lonely brahmin priest. The essence of the Sürya-Sevana rite is the making of Holy Water. The priest, sitting on a mat in a small open pavilion, says Sanskrit mantras, prayers and hymns, makes sacral gestures (mudräs) and handles some small brass implements. First he purifies himself, then he induces the God, Shiva-Sun, to enter through his head into his heart and further into the cup of water, which thereby is hallowed. Finally Shiva Sun is prayed to return to His divine abode, leaving the priest's body as it was before. At the end of the ceremony the priest sips a little of the Holy Water, which is further used to purify places, food and persons by sprinkling. The importance of this rite in Balinese Hinduism is apparent from the fact that the religion is commonly called Ägama Tirtha, Holy Water religion. Dr. Hooykaas has treated the subject very thoroughly and methodically. The philological study of the numerous palmleaf manuscripts containing notes on the Sürya-Sevana mantras and slokas occupies many pages. They contain tables and lists of variae lectiones of Sanskrit and Javanese-Balinese texts, provided with English translations. The second chapter (pp. 44-129) and the Appendices (p.p. 158-186) are mainly philological studies. The introduction (chapter I, pp. 9-42) contains notes on the principal elements of the rites: Sanskrit mantras, hymns and mudräs. The last paragraph of the Introduction (pp. 35-42) contains a "Summary of Sürya-Sevana" which is a description of the actions and words of the priest. Beside these descriptive chapters, which are divided into numerous paragraphs the book contains two chapters dealing with the religious significance of the rite Chapter III (pp. 131-140) contains "A Balinese Priest's Detailed Comment", with an English translation. It is, of course, interesting to learn what a Balinese scholar offers as explanation of the numerous actions, mantras and hymns of the rite. Viewing the subject from a broad standpoint, Dr. Hooykaas has offered in the fourth chapter (pp. 141-156) a "Comparison of Saiva Ritual in South India and Bali." He has found four books containing descriptions of Shivaitic rites performed by priests in South India: Instrument and Purpose, Studies on Rites and Ritual in South India by Carl Gustav Diehl (Lund, 1956), "Das Püjävidhinirüpana des Trimalla" by Fausta Nowotny (Indo-Iranian Journal, I, 1957), Rauravägama, Volume I by N. R. Bhatt (Publications de l'Institut Français d'Indologie, no 18, Pondichéry) (Paris, Maisonneuve, 1961) and Le Rituel quotidien sivaite de l'Inde du Sud selon Somasambhu by Hélène Brunner Lachaux (same Publications, no 25) (1963). These books have enabled him to com pare the Balinese rites with the Indian ones. Moreover Dr. Hooykaas's Sürya-Sevana contains, spread throughout the book, two valuable contributions towards the knowledge of Balinese religion. The first one is the collection of drawings of Balinese priests performing their rites which were made by the Swedish artist Tyra de Kleen in cooperation with Mr. P. de Kat Angelino, a</page><page sequence="3">42 REVIEWS Dutch magistrate residing in South Bali in the early twenties. The drawings were first published in a Dutch book, Moedras op Bali, Handhoudingen der Priesters (The Hague, 1922). German and English editions appeared in 1923 (Folkwang Verlag, Hagen) and 1924 (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., London, and E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York). Another, smaller collection of drawings of mudräs, made recently by a Balinese artist, has been added to the artistical work by Tyra de Kleen. The second contribution towards the study of religion in Bali, incorporated in Sürya-Sevana, is the complete English translation of all Sanskrit and Balinese texts and words. Moreover an "Index to Ägama Tirtha and Sürya-Sevana" has been appended (pp. 192-224). The Index contains a glossary of Javanese-Balinese, Balinese and Sanskrit words found in the texts, with references to the pages of the two books where explanations are provided. Dr. Hooykaas was able to supplement the "Glossary of Sanskrit from Indonesia" by J.Ensink and J.A.B.van Buitenen (in VAK, no 6, December 1964, Deccan College, Poona) by some newly found words. Old Javanese, Javanese-Balinese and Balinese lexicography is also enriched by the references to religious texts. The combination of the Index of Names (Balinese, Dutch and English) with the Glossary of Words (Balinese, Javanese, Sanskrit and English) is very practical. Two or more separate indexes would have meant time wasted for the interested reader looking for information. Compared with the book under review, Dr. Hooykaas's previous book, Ägama Tirtha, Five Studies in Hindu-Balinese Religion, may contain more varied reading matter on different subjects which are interesting for anthropologists in general. Surya-Sevana, however, is an exhaustive study of one subject, the most important rite of high-class Balinese priests. The thorough philological studies of the mantras and prayers in the Introduction, the second chapter and the Appendices are remark able scholarly achievements. They constitute a complete Balinese prayer book. Pub lished separately, these sections of Sürya-Sevana would form a useful textbook and manual for Balinese students of religion and aspirants for the priesthood. Such a book does not yet exist in Bali. In the Preface (p. 5) Dr. Hooykaas mentions the appearance, in 1966, of a Balinese edition of a part of Sylvain Lévi's "Sanskrit Texts from Bali" of 1933. Dr. Hooykaas's work contains much more material than the older book, and it is wholly based on the best Balinese information available. It would certainly appeal to religiously minded Balinese scholars. The appearance of a Balinese prayer book compiled by a Dutch orientalist would be a noteworthy instance of friendly coopera tion of scholars belonging to different cultures. However, the perusal of those sections of Sürya-Sevana which contain the Sanskrit mantras makes great demands upon the perseverance of non-Balinese readers. Dr. Hooykaas has been aware of this fact, and therefore he has inserted the "Summary of Sürya-Sevana" (pp. 35-42). This paragraph contains most of the material which is interesting for non-Balinese students of Balinese religion. The fourth chapter, "Comparison of Saiva Ritual in South India and Bali", is the most interesting one, seen from a general point of view. Dr. Hooykaas's conclusions, summarized in the paragraphs E and F, need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that in both countries the "unification of the worshipper's soul with the l§iva Soul" seems to be the essence of the ritual. In South India an anthropomorphic concept of the Deity is an important feature of religion. In Bali it seems to be mostly absent from the daily worship, whereas the Holy Water, which is so very important in Bali, is much less so in South India. Dr. Hooykaas's expectation (p. 156) "that more critical editions of South Indian ägama will shed light not only on the development of South Indian ritual but also on the period when the present-day Balinese ritual was borrowed" is likely. However, in the present reviewer's opinion, it seems possible that the Balinese ritual developed in its own way, diverging from its Indian prototype, during the four or five centuries</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 43 of isolation following the conversion of Java to Islam about 1500 A.D. The priestly rites as described in Sûrya-Sevana do not satisfy the Balinese people's need for reli gious accompaniment of the stages of life and death. Beside the Hindu-Javanese ritual there exists a popular religiosity of indigenous, pre-Hinduistic origin. It seems probable that its manifestations, such as ancestor worship and sumptuous disposal of the dead, have been influenced by Indian ideas in the course of the centuries. There is no reason to assume, however, that the Indian rites have forever remained the same since the time when they were introduced into the Archipelago. Some differences between South Indian and Balinese rites, as they are at present, might be the result of the influence exercised by autochthonous Balinese religious concepts on the develop ment of Hinduistic ritual in Bali. Surya-Sevana is an excellent exposé of a special Hinduistic aspect of Balinese religion, the Siva cult. The sub-title, The Way to God of a Balinese Siva Priest, has been added in order to place this fact into due relief. It is hoped that Dr. Hooykaas will continue his valuable series of publications on Bali. In some of his next books the autochthonous aspect of the Balinese religion might come to the foreground. Some features - exorcism, ancestor worship, trance, potlatch - have been mentioned already in the Conclusion of the present book (p. 155). The image of Balinese culture, presented so vividly in Dr. Hooykaas's publications, would be deceptive if Sûrya-Sevana is not counter balanced by descriptions of the other, popular and indigenous, aspects of the religion of the artistic inhabitants of the beautiful island.
