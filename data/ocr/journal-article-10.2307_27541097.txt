<plain_text><page sequence="1">138 ARTS AND LETTERS ONE FLEW EAST, ONE FLEW WEST, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST* By GEORGE SCARBROUGH When we were children, among the counting-out games we played was one that ended: One flew east, one flew west, One flew over the cuckoo's nest. Where the cuckoo's nest was I, for one, didn't know. It seemed to my childish imagination any direction at all or all directions at the same time. Every which way, or every whichaway, as we would have said then. Confessedly, the cuckoo's nest bothered me, particularly since I had been reading English child stories about storks that built their nests on chimneys (I hoped not in them), and rather supposed a cuck oo was something like a stork. Secretly, however, I knew the cuckoo was not a stork?I had heard that old story about the stork; any child has. I knew the cuckoo was a smaller bird, perhaps brown, perhaps gray, and certainly a little crazy. "You're cuckoo!" my friends shouted at me. But what the cuckoo was exactly, I still didn't know. The cuckoo was a feeling, a surmise, a gallimaufry of birds, a none-such, that lived high in the branches of a tree in a nest of sticks and peered vaguely down at the surrounding world, occasionally uttering a mad, bisyllabic cry that unsettled my brains. Anyway, that is how I think I felt about the cuckoo as we went round in a ring, chanting, "One flew east, one flew west. . . . Out goes he!" The last child put out was It. I was usually the last child put out. It was only my luck, nothing to be bitter about; though at times I did suspect that not only *James Dickey, Two Poems of the Air, Portland, Oregon (Centicore Press), 1964, 84 pages, $6.50.

Possibly my habit of always being put out or put off began early, right there in that yard in that ring with my brothers and sister and our (or their) friends. I got used to being put out. It came to be that if I was not put out, something was wrong. So I was not surprised, when handed this passel of books, to find myself put out, over nothing, really, more important than finding some thing which they all possessed in common. Covers, I found, would not do. There had to be some idea that might, by stretching and bend ing, tie them together into a recognizable continuity. My first thought was to use the autobiographical element, common to a greater or a smaller degree, to them all. But there was not enough of it to justify its use. Next, I tried journeys, and some were going journeys, mostly west in miles (until west became east) and leagues in mind. Others went in other directions. But some, I concluded, merely flew over the cuckoo's nest. So, after having discarded this gambit and that, I fi nally came to point with Louis Simpson, who says that American poetry contains everything, even poems: Whatever it is, it must have A stomach that can digest Rubber, coal, uranium, moons, poems. Like the shark, it contains a shoe. It must swim for miles through the desert Uttering cries that are almost human. At last I had found it. American poetry is the cuckoo's nest! Quali fying on every score, as I had imagined that fabulous place. Put to gether piecemeal of ends and oddments, of bricks and straws and bits of ocean foam. Diversity was all that I could find, and the unity that good poetry, if and when it occurs, achieves through the diversity that it makes is good. I found my passel of books to be diverse enough to furnish specific instances in support of Mr. Simpson's induction. On opening James Dickey's Two Poems of the Air, I was fur ther irritated to find the cursive script in which the book is set, hav ing had my feelings exacerbated earlier by the rather awkward, rec tangular shape of the book itself. Tricks of showmanship, I thought; more difficulty in handling and reading. I wondered where and how I would shelve the thing. I felt like Walt Whitman when he was told that one of his works should be bound in vellum. Walt was outraged.</page><page sequence="3">140 ARTS AND LETTERS "Pshaw," he snorted, "?hangings, curtains, finger bowls, chinaware, Matthew Arnold!" I'd like to ask the man, I thought on my own, what beautiful calligraphy and an unorthodox binding have to do with poetry. Then I began to read, resentfully I admit, only to find myself caught up in an impressive poem that, in afterthought, seems to demand the book's long, flying shape, the winged script, not only because the open ing poem deals with the fire-bombing of Japan, but because the book seemed somehow in flight in my hands as I read. What's a trick or two, I conceded, in the face of what the poem is? Admittedly, though, the poem does not need tricks. I do not know James Dickey. Whether he flies or not, for me re mains an Open question. I hope he does, if for no other reason than to support a theory I toy with that out of the so-called "sports" (and that is a horrible word to use in this context) man is physically ad dicted to, whether big-game hunting, boating, mountain-climbing, fight ing, or what not, only those men addicted to flying have been notably successful as writers, Hemingway, who was a flyer among many other things, notwithstanding. But whether Dickey flies or not is beside the point. He flies in his poem, from one man's home to another man's home, bringing a gift of fire that finds out the walls and (to paraphrase a bit) clings to them like a child. And in the process, finds out the world's conscience i,n the individual man's and smothers it with torment. This moving poem rakes the emotions like side fire. Skillfully playing on the things a man loves, his own four walls, his wife, children, even the monthly bills on everything never paid for (and here is a tender point to be extrapolated), using the word "pantry" and other kitchen terms over and over metonymically, Dickey fashions an atmosphere of love and terror that grips and holds and will not let go. Encountering the many references to the human arm as though it were an incipient wing, I thought of Prometheus and Icarus, and of their achievement and suf fering. Reversing the Icarus theme, I saw the flyer as Icarus coming too near his earth-built sun and plunging backward into a sea of guilt and torment formulated from his possession of perfect wings. There is always a sea waiting, I thought. With foresight, too, there are con sequences. Unfortunately, this poem forbids piecemeal quotation. But I offer you this invitation: Come in, my house is yours, come in If you can, if you Can pass this unfired door.</page><page sequence="4">ARTS AND LETTERS 141 Mr. Dickey's second poem is, for me, less moving, though the de scriptions of the flight south over the middle of the earth are, in them selves, more beautiful than those in the previous poem. I hear too audibly here the greater pulsations of Hart Crane's The Bridge, and most particularly of the "Southern Cross" section. Perhaps I allow the poem to suffer unjustly in consequence. I do not mean to. It is a fine poem. There is a wing-growing motion Half-alive in every creature sums up the general flight theme, and the great, buoyant motion of flight itself simply engulfs. For these two poems I feel grateful to Mr. Dickey. I wish I might omit from Louis Simpson's At the End of the Open Road the few tame, even timid poems which a lack of editorial care has allowed in. Then I might say, as I believe him to be saying, that too many modern poets are like people in apartment houses?or a "standing-room only" America, who have been silent too long at their living in the too closely populated day and night, for fear that someone in the next room will overhear; that, like these people, who become more silent as the next room becomes more crowded, the poets trim their fine agonies to even finer proportions, and climaxes disap pear; that poetry seems to become more and more an international competition in smooth lines and innocuous statements, mostly a matter of surfaces. That people, and poets, have stopped westering. But the handful of shy comments do not really vitiate Mr. Simpson's book, whose opening section is, I believe, one of the strongest groups of poems I have read in several years. As a theme for the four poems of which the introduction is composed, I quote the shortest, "In the Suburbs": There's no way out. You were born to waste your life. You were born to this middle class life As others before you Were born to walk in procession To the temple, singing. Mr. Simpson, too, is taking journeys, purposive journeys, consciously</page><page sequence="5">142 ARTS AND LETTERS looking for himself, and not as Mr. Dickey's pilot, who found himself serendipitously on an ordered mission. Because this is true, his ap peals to Walt Whitman, the great self-full, are just and right. All the more so, since the Self Whitman contemplated was not so much the personal self as an extrapolation of that personal self to a universal scale. I am glad Louis Simpson has the courage of his liking to make those appeals. He may have reached the end of the open road, and we with him, but he is helping to end the day when to be influenced by Whitman is a state critically worthy of scorn. At least we have broken through that cul de sac. Every night, at the end of America, We taste our wine, looking at the Pacific. How sad it is, the end of America! Perhaps it is the end of America, in more ways than one. I wish I might quote the whole of the final poem, "Lines Written near San Francisco," a poem that companions the initial poem, "In California," and binds the volume together strongly, beautifully, despite the few errant pieces. No other comment would be needed on this book of elegiac tone. But space forbids. Whitman was wrong about the People, But right about himself. The land is within. At the end of the open road, we come to ourselves. Though mad Columbus follows the sun Into the sea, we cannot follow. We must remain, to serve the returning sun, And to set the table for death. For we are the colonists of Death? Not, as some think, of the English. Like James Dickey, Louis Simpson is not afraid to think; more im portantly, neither man is afraid to feel, nor to say what he feels and to say it roughly, grippingly. There is hope here. William Dickey's title, The Interpreter's House, bothers me. I can't see how it applies to the house of the Interpreter in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, in which house "excellent things" were to be seen and known. Perhaps it doesn't and shouldn't apply. Perhaps I have a one-track, school-room mind and am myself</page><page sequence="6">ARTS AND LETTERS 143 over the cuckoo's nest. But remembering Bunyan, I prepared myself for excellent things, and found them not; at least, not many. William Dickey feels along the edges of things and events for mean ings, admitting his rejection of a great deal of the poet's usual para phernalia, and particularly of anything inclined in the romantic direc tion. He depends on commonplace descriptions of commonplaces to carry most of the burden of his intent. Somehow this just doesn't do it. He does, however, manage to get a hook in. Much of his work is as gritty and tasteless (and uncomfortable) as a mouthful of sand. Al most everywhere, whether he is writing of himself and wife, of islands or astronomers, there is a cold, almost impersonal definition of himself as interpreter. As though the word "interpreter" by its very nature does not mean negotiator, one who goes between, explainer, this poet never quite commits himself, is patently reluctant to be involved. (In passing, I might remark that Mr. Dickey might just be in the Inter preter's house, looking at and?like the rest of us?not quite under standing "excellent things." If so, I am not only over, I am on the cuckoo's nest.) Apparently the poet feels that the interpreter's job is merely to state dimensions and to allow the reader carte blanche in filling in whatever personal reaction he may have to be evoked at the naming of an event, the sounding of a word. Perhaps in his mind romanticism is still a nasty word. However that may be, there is a kind of romanticism in these lines from his "For an Astronomer": After the round red corporate sun has sunk With a glittering smile and smoking a big cigar, And the chimneys stinking like upright bits of punk Have lost their brick assurance of what they are. . . . The qualifiers here are hardly objective. The whole poem flays the mind with a vicious color that totals out achromatically and is a poem so successful it sickens. Here, it seems to me, is a falsified kind of ro mantic far-outness which the poet himself did not recognize. William Dickey's best poem, and a fine one indeed it seems to me, is the poem in which he offers his objections to, or fear of, romanti cism as such. "After the Romantics"?and he certainly is, both ways? details delightfully, even whimsically, the things which the poet will not do, beginning: I'll not go hunting In that kind of wood, Where the beasts are all but human, And the water not good. . . .</page><page sequence="7">144 ARTS AND LETTERS and ending with the assertion that, if asked to go to a wood of that kind, the poet would only praise the bravery of the asker And stay behind To shoot my own here Where the beasts are thin, But there's never an eye's flicker That calls me kin, To listen to the light patter Of my sole spring, That gives only water, plain water, Not some other thing. Obviously, Mr. Dickey is pulling his reader's leg or is afraid of things that go bump in the night. I do not trust him. I'd like to ask him really about the meaning of the line: "Where the beasts are all but human," but, of course, asking is not possible. In this business, you either do or don't. The double meaning embedded in that line, however, could throw his whole poem. I am aware that what I have said here could be made by him to seem marvelously stupid. I am merely sticking my finger in the dam. I resent, naturally, his distaste for anthropomorphism, as anyone brought up on Thornton Burgess will understand. But perhaps he merely summons his reader to clarity?which, in his estimation it seems, amounts to shearing away the emotional attachment to the world, which is fine if one is willing to shear away the world. But I am quibbling. William Dickey writes an occasional fine poem, in which the glitter in the ice promises the sometime warmth of a thaw. And if we go to the Celestial City, we go by various ways. After all, the Interpreter's house is inside the wicket gate and very near to Bunyan's town. The rest of us are possibly only en route, somewhere in the in-between or the out-back. It is a thought to balance the vitriol, any way. Despite some very chromatic statements (confessions) of experience and belief, or lack of belief but not of experience, The True Con fession of George Barker is, in color, gray. That a book so obviously intended to be prismatic should be, by some internal chemi cal change that makes or breaks books, reduced to the colorless state is, at first, incomprehensible. Or so it was to me. I felt only that here</page><page sequence="8">ARTS AND LETTERS 145 was something like old crepe paper that has been left out in the sun; and the rain: bleak, dreary, merely suggesting what the language strove so hard to infuse. All the dyes had run; one could not tell the original tints. Yet one can know and understand the original impulses behind the writing of this book. Western culture does not, perhaps, any more suffice. But violent language (the author calls himself a "sickening snot-engendered bastard") does not necessarily mean more than a limited communication with the reader, if, at times, any at all. In fact, communication is effected, though I doubt of the kind the poet wished for. The language is so bald and flat and terribly disgusted (and disgusting) at times that I, for one, am uproariously amused, especially when he says of birth Really We are excreted, like shit, though Shakespeare hardly said it any better. Not that I think the writer doesn't mean it. He does. O he does! Which makes it all the funnier for me, when, I am sure, he meant the essence of tragedy. It isn't fair to be laughing at a man's life story (though I suspect George Barker of being a little amused at himself), even if he is middle-aged and mad because he can't recharge a battery. Aren't we all? I think I should apologize. Had this book been less of a one-man show, it might have become at least a dramatic monologue. Technically, I think the flaw lies in the poet's refusal to introduce other characters as counterpoint or as sound ing-boards, a device which might have relieved both writer and reader. Where are those who participated in the mornings, the evenings, mid nights, dawns? I miss them. Life may be hell, comical as hell some times can be and hellish, at others, beyond the power of language to convey, but a self-conducted tour through hell has to fall flat because it is an itinerary whose points of interest fail to attract because there is no sense of sharing, of gazing doubly upon horrors. The poet actually knows this, evidencing his knowledge by the writing of his confessions. But the reader is a vicarious participant, at best a shadowy figure in limbo, whom the author hopes to get through to, but really never has any assurance of. Participation lies in the event. Here, I feel shut out, barred. What might have been a tour de force of name-dropping and name-calling becomes, for lack of other legs to the triangle an</page><page sequence="9">146 ARTS AND LETTERS onanistic trip out behind the barn. One face should never fill the pool, nor one navel become the omphalos of the universe. I quote nothing in toto because only the outraged things stuck in my mind. A question occurs at departure: Would not a change of pace in the stanza form of the poem have helped matters, as well perhaps as a variation in the tetrameter movement? The package is a little too neat for the content. In The Etruscan Princess and Other Poems, Celeste Turn er Wright manages occasionally to turn out a pleasant little lyric, whose syntax is not so wrenched nor whose wording so curious (and all for the sake of that prat-fall, rhyme) as to leave the reader aghast at such awkwardness. When this reviewer did come upon one of these rare (meaning scarce) pieces, he felt like a discoverer. For the most part, any real meaning has been siphoned away from these poems by the desperate striving to fit them into conventional patterns, where the musical scheme must be considered first and the meaning, if considered at all, later. I hate to be slapped in the face with a rhyme, obtrusive, cold, spongy as a dead fish; or brushed lightly with one painted as a peacock's wings and as effective as that wing would be in sweeping the garden path. When I find "prolix" made to rhyme with "chicks," or "stuck" with "asuck," I am dismayed. Such an expression as "fringy finger-jerk" leaves me slightly addled, wondering where the poetry is. A forced, inverted language stymies most of Miss Wright's verse. Karl Shapiro's The Bourgeois Poet, which reads at times like a middle-aged HOWL, must be read in, not through. As poetry, it is prose; as prose, it lacks continuity and characters, is more autobiogra phy than anything else, though it really isn't autobiography. It is more the heart of Mr. Shapiro's journals, dateless and selected, evidently, from the evening paragraphs only, these written after the fifth high ball or possibly a fifth, period. I do not mean to sound too flippant. I simply am not impressed, particularly so after Trial of A Poet, whose excellences make the present effort seem all the way downhill. I do not object to the form, since form is now anything the poet can manage. A man can do what he can do. I mean: Hymen's got a cold. Hymen, your nose is running. My love, you look like Beethoven, like you were hit by a truck. You look like a fucking skull. It's six o'clock, you're drunk, you speak Greek in your sleep, you snore like Henry the Ninth. Wake up and take the dimes off my eyes.</page><page sequence="10">ARTS AND LETTERS 147 That's what I mean. If you're looking for a smile, all right; though the smile suffers a change when you remember a grown-up wrote this. Babette Deutsch has always impressed me as being a fine painter in words, capable of arresting an image in the mind's eye. Not that she is devoid of ideas. On the contrary. But that, with minor excep tions (as in "Three Views of Mount Rainier," which is a bit nonsensical and childish with its image of the snowy mountain as a giant ice cream for God), she is able to confront the mind with a dimensional, chro matic picture that is an idea in itself, or better still, that evokes a series of ideas in pretty much the same way that a Japanese landscape un folds its possibilities. I rather think the Japanese and the Chinese painters and poets have meant a lot to Miss Deutsch. Her Collected Poems, i?i?-i?62, covers, from the standpoint of years, the better part of a lifetime, and extends to the reader who himself has survived those years the comfort of knowing that a sensi tive, lively intelligence found some grace in them. Her poetic forms are varied, the poetry only here and there obviously and painfully the writing of a woman. But her best verse (and I mean by "best": com petent, good, though certainly not great) evidences a perception, a liveli ness, that is sometimes Elizabethan, always wholly individual, belonging to no one else; also apparent, in her wide choice of verse forms, is a personal development that has owed little to movements or schools. I find myself moved by such pieces as "Reflections"?a poem about a man on the spot: Pontius Pilate?in which, as in a mirror, one sees the . . . womanish gesture Of one who has desired To be free of choices : a burden Too heavy for old men. Much of the poetry is like this, leaning hjeavily on traditional themes but treating them in a personal way, witjh a strong, controlled touch that argues much for Miss Deutsch's perception and originality. Read ing these explicit, sometimes subtly refined, experiences is to under stand how the years may be challenged with a wager on their mean ing and outqome. Reading James Schevill's The Stalingrad Elegies, as poign ant and reportorial as he manages to make them, I cannot quite es cape the feeling of reading secondhand. I do not need to be told that</page><page sequence="11">148 ARTS AND LETTERS these poems are based on something; I need only be told that they are based on the recently revealed documents of the German Nazi army trapped in Stalingrad. Not that a vicarious experience is useless to a poet; he is a reader like all the rest of us. But to be of much use that experience has to catch fire, to undergo a transmutation in the reader's mind that bridges the gap between actor and spectator, if the spectator is adequately to describe the action. Nothing, I grant, should take fire more quickly than experiences such as these must ?have been, even in the reading about them. Empathy should have been a matter of course. But, for me, the events and meanings in these poems seem remote, far away from actuality, watered down with the expected, horribly real but heavy clich?s of war. The fresh, ugly horrendous note of the first hand is lacking. Npt everyone can do wjhat Stephen Crane did with a few soldiers' tales and newspaper articles. Nonetheless, aside from the usual banalities of romance, which seem to grow more banal wjien the guns begin to pop (as banal herie as a "Dear John" letter), there is an occasional arresting moment in this account. For instance, in "The Astronomer," these lines begin to vi brate with something eerily authentic: I think in light-years, but live these days in seconds. Around us everything grows white in the snow, Even the blood from wounds is curiously pale, Grey, winter lilies shooting from the frozen steppe. Unfortunately, before its close, the poem becomes dissipated, mildly then wildly prosaic. It seems that Mr. Schevill, the moment he con siders women, becomes mawkish and long-winded. When he stays away from sex, obviously his b?te noir, and writes instead of other things, as in "He Is Not Here in Stalingrad," a poem to a minister father about the absence of God, he becomes a strongly controlled, forceful poet, and I can respect him. A first book may or may not signify more than the fact that a man has written and has published a first book. Time will tell whether Waking in a Tree by Daniel Hughes signifies more. I cannot rightly tell from this evidence. In the meantime, a handful of these poems can be read with real enjoyment. Lyrical, rough, bitter, even agonizing, such a poem as "Castrato to Audience" cries out to be spoken, to be declaimed:</page><page sequence="12">ARTS AND LETTERS 149 Dear father, master of all arts, when You brought me to the hot needle and the thumbs That burned music in my thighs, I hated you. But see where the sickly, mewling trumpet comes For challenge. Let the fat burgher blow and blow, My throat denies him! Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now melt the air! Maestro, attendez! With fugato sweet and cantilena chaste I fix your eyes on heaven. ... Below the waist The bats grind darkness, the snakes spit up their prey. To balance the evident excellences, there are as evident gaucheries. Occasionally lines, in or out of context, cannot be deciphered, become, for me at least, pure gibberish. This which is unfair both to Mr. Hughes and to me. It should be the duty of any writer, even of a poet who sports his license, to write clearly and unmistakably, if not literally, then by all means analogically. And, further, not to become involved in a figure too ludicrous to be believed. Consider this from "Leonardo's Notebooks," if the author will permit me my little beef: A roast chars itself behind the door, Cunning, quiescent, delirious to be done. ... Now, now, Mr. Hughes! Even if someone else did say it, you shouldn't. A sentient roast? Shades of darkest Africa! With It Takes Practice Not To Die, by Elizabeth Bardett, we have the curious situation of a volume whose title may very well be its best poem. This is not to disparage the proems proper, though some are worth disparagement; but to make a statement. The tide is a poem. It turns me cold with truth, with something I have often felt but never put into wtords. It does take practice not to die. The prac tice of all die early morning risings in the world, when one feels like everything else but rising. But it also takes practice to write a good poem, though some are, like this title I suspect, born full-blown into existence, happily erupting into a receptive air some moment and re maining as though they had always been. There are a few such here. "Jinxed," for example, which I wish I might quote entirely, with its riddle-song air, begins: 11</page><page sequence="13">150 ARTS AND LETTERS I went to the orchard where the trees were ripe and found a hard lemon. ... and concludes several stanzas on: I went to the city at last for the source, and there in the streets were men. Or "As You Make It," with its eerie witchery of repetition. The lady must have had a grandmother. Your bed they said so shall you lie on it But I found rocks were kinder than clocks and did not cry for it. . . . and so on for nine stanzas of incantation. But a handful of pieces, like "The Sacrament," are so inept as to make the reader wonder how the happy few got mixed in. These poems are too ambitious. They min gle far too many kinds of poetry, from Anglo-Saxon four-beats and caesuras down to Dylan Thomas and runaway rhetoric. A fistful fail because the author has nothing to say. I suspect that any writer has only one or two really good things in him; that once he makes his mark, whatever else he writes lives on the reputation. I know this is tirue of the English "greats," despite what the English professors say. Else I would have read and enjoyed Spenser's "The Faerie Queen" or the rest of Byron's "Don Juan." As I look back over a large percentage of the poems in these books, I find them like those palely beautiful moulds of gelatin brought in to decorate a plate: grand to look at but insipid to the taste. This is a figure far removed from the counting-out game, with which I began this review, and whose end I have finally reached. But anything goes in the cuckoo's nest. My only fear is that I have counted myself out again. But this time, at least, it was not the will of the gods.</page></plain_text>
