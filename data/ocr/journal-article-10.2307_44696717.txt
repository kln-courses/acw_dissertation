<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIRGIL'S METAMORPHOSES: MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas 490 atque metus omnis et inexorabile fatum subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis auari. fortunatus et ille deos qui nouit agrestis Panaque Siluanumque senem Nymphasque sorores. (Geo. 2.490-4) [Happy is he who has been able to learn the causes of things, and has trampled underfoot every fear, and unyielding Fate, and the din of greedy Acheron. Fortunate, too, is he who knows the rustic gods, Pan and old Silvanus and the sister Nymphs.] In these famous words, Virgil expresses his ambivalent relationship with his great didactic model, Lucretius.1 The double makarismos suggests a declaration of allegiance to two incompatible views of the world: the rationalist philosophy of Epicurus and a nostalgic longing for the simple rustic piety which the Romans of the late Republic and early Empire were so fond of attributing to the farmer and the countryman. How are we to explain this strange contradiction, which lies at the very heart of Virgil's poem, in one of its most overtly programmatic passages? The question is connected with two areas of debate which have dominated discussion of the poem over the last few decades. Is the Georgics an optimistic work, reflecting a belief in Providence and celebrating the end of the Civil Wars and the beginning of a new Golden Age; or is it a pessimistic work, painting a gloomy picture of a world dominated by conflict and failure and expressing a covert hostility towards the new regime?2 And how are we to evaluate Virgil's relationship with his models? Is the Georgics really an Ascraeum carmen , a De rerum natura , or a work of Alexandrian doctrina , superficially concerned with agriculture, but really more interested in learned allusion, scholarly debate and ultimately in poetry itself?3 Thomas, in particular, has argued that Hesiod and Lucretius are really far less important to Virgil than Callimachus and Homeric epic, which is transformed in characteris- tically Alexandrian fashion. This multiplicity of views may be significant in itself. The optimism/pessimism debate seems to me somewhat sterile, but I suggest that it has arisen in part from the nature of the poem itself, and in particular from the complex network of intertextual relations which underlies it. The enormous discrepancy between the various readings of the poem may be attributed to its polyphonic character.4 There is no single authorial</page><page sequence="2">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 37 voice guiding the reader through the text, but rather a multiplicity of voices which come to the fore one after another. Thus, one voice tells us that Jupiter is a benevolent father, another that he wilfully destroys the farmer's hard- won harvest. One voice tells us that the farmer's life is one of unremitting toil, another that the Earth pours forth food for him of her own accord. The 'optimistic' critic will say that the more positive voice predominates, while the 'pessimist' will say that it is undermined by the negative one. My own line of approach is rather different. It seems to me that Virgil is not concerned to give us a straightforward view of the world, either positive or negative. On the contrary, the contradictions express different possibilities, contributing to a picture of the world which is complex, uncertain and shifting: the same state of affairs can be explained in quite different ways, like the proverbial half-full (or half-empty) bottle. The polyphonic character of the poem is intimately connected with Virgil's use of his models. Leaving aside Callimachus and Homer (whose importance cannot be fully discussed here), each of the main intertexts views the world in a different way. For Lucretius, there is no Providence, and death and decay are inevitable; on the other hand, happiness is easy to attain, simply by accepting the world as it really is. Hesiod's picture is grimmer: though worshipping the gods will bring its rewards, endless toil is inevitable, and success can be attained only through hard work. For Aratus, on the other hand, Zeus is a kindly father, akin to the Stoic pronoia ,5 and the universe is systematic and orderly. Virgil's text allows each of these models to predominate in turn (particularly in book 1, where Hesiod and Aratus are most prominent), orches- trating their different voices in such a way as to emphasize the differences between them, rather than to produce a homogenous, unified whole. In contrast with most recent critics, I believe that Lucretius is the major model throughout the poem. But Virgil is concerned neither simply to imitate his model, nor to react negatively against it. The effect of his Lucretian allusions could be described rather as subversion or problema- tization. Lucretius' tidy and basically optimistic world-view is challenged either by juxtaposition with the conflicting views of the other models, or by bringing together passages of the De rerum natura which can be made to seem contradictory, or by using Lucretian language to frame very un-Lucretian ideas. These different strategies can be traced in Virgil' s treatment of myth and religion, which can be seen in part as a response to Lucretius' complex and subtle use of mythological language and imagery. I have argued elsewhere that Lucretius' use of myth is the product of an innovative and subtle theory of its nature and origins.6 In two important passages, the accounts of the origins of religion in 5.1 161-1240 and the phenomenon of echoes in 4.580-94, the poet hints at an explanation for the creation of myths. Early men (or ignorant rustics) observe the heavens or strange terrestrial phenomena which they are unable to explain. Either through fear or for the pleasure of tale-telling, they attribute these phenomena to the presence or influence of the gods: ergo perfugium sibi habe bant omnia diuis I trade re, as Lucretius puts it in 5.1 186-7. It is of course the duty of the Epicurean poet to rid mankind of superstitious fear by demythologizing these phenomena and</page><page sequence="3">38 MONICA GALE banishing the gods once and for all to the intermundia. But Lucretius also sees myth as having an inherently attractive psychagogic power, which is of potentially immense value to him in his enterprise of converting the non-Epicurean reader to a philosophy which is superficially unattractive.7 His solution to this problem is both to demythologize nature and, at the same time, to retain the use of mythological images. This is achieved in two ways: either by juxtaposing the mythological image with a blunt statement of its falsehood, and of the true, atomistic explanation; or by using mythological imagery without explicit reference to the myth, in the very process of providing the Epicurean account. So, for example, the myth of Phaethon is recounted to support the idea that the balance of the elements is precarious and will eventually bring about the destruction of the earth, but Lucretius immediately continues scilicet ut ueteres Graium cecinere poetae. quod procul a uera nimis est ratione repulsum. ignis enim superare potest ubi materiai ex infinita sunt corpora plura coorta . . . (5.405-8) [so, at least, the old Greek poets sang. But this is very far removed from true reason. For fire can prevail when more particles of its matter come together from infinite space . . .] In Lucretius' account of the origins of civilization at the end of book 5, there are numerous examples of implicit reference to myths. In explaining the discovery of fire, for example, he tells how a thunderbolt brought down the heavenly fire as a gift to mankind and distributed it amongst them. Later, the sun taught them the art of cooking. The choice of vocabulary here recalls the myths of divine benefactors, specifically Prometheus. The passage is almost an allegorical interpretation of the myth - but Lucretius never refers to it explicitly nor departs from the strictly rationalistic tone of his culture-history. This exploitation of mythological imagery allows Lucretius to have his cake and eat it. Myth is rationalized and thus disposed of as a serious account of natural phenomena, but mythological language is retained as an attractive and vivid way of speaking about the world. In addition, such passages implicitly suggest ways in which the myths might have originated: in attempts to account for droughts and floods, or to understand how cultural developments came about. The originality of Lucretius' theory lies above all in the suggestion that the myth-makers were the victims of error: other allegorists, such as the Stoics, were inclined to see myth as embodying some ultimate truth. For Lucretius, it is possible to explain myth via a scientific explanation of the natural world, but never vice versa. A special case is the hymn to Venus in the proem. Here, we have to wait some time before the poet undermines the beautiful but ultimately misleading picture of the goddess's power over the natural world which inaugurates the poem.8 Nevertheless, it is ultimately undermined, as the text carefully steers its reader away from a personal</page><page sequence="4">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 39 to an impersonal view of nature, and balances the images of nature's creative side with a grimmer view of natura creatrix et perfica ,9 growth balanced by inevitable decay, culminating in the mass destruction of humanity in the Athenian plague at the end of book 6. To return, then, to the Georgics. Virgil reacts to Lucretius' use of mythological imagery in three major ways, which may be termed conflation, remythologization and extension. Each of these has the effect of problematizing Lucretius' confident assurance that myth and the natural world can be explained simply. Virgil achieves this either by conflating Lucretian and non-Lucretian passages; or by remythologizing phenomena which Lucretius had demythologized; or by extending Lucretius' alle- gorizing method to myths which the earlier poet had treated in a rather different way. I now turn to some examples. 1. Conflation In the first part of Georgics 1, the most obvious model is Hesiod. Lines 43-203 (where there is a strong break) correspond roughly to Hesiod' s 'works', 204-351 to his 'days',10 at which point Aratus takes over. On the other hand, although the framework is Hesiodic, the vocabulary and detail are highly reminiscent of Lucretius, especially in the opening lines which lead up to the first excursus, the 'aetiology of labor ' (1 18-59). Virgil, like Lucretius and unlike Hesiod or the Roman agricultural writers, begins in spring, 'when the ice melts away from the white mountain-peaks and the crumbling clod is loosened by Zephyrus'. Similar imagery of loosening and opening occurs in Lucretius' proem, but Virgil's instructions for ploughing also recall the more negative pictures of the productive capacity of the earth which Lucretius paints when arguing that the world is too imperfect to be the work of the gods.11 Lucretius shows us different aspects of the natural world at different times, as it suits his argument: from one point of view the earth is fertile and productive, the source of all life; from another, it is worn out, like a woman past the age of child-bearing, since it can no longer produce crops and living beings spontaneously, as the first plants and animals were produced.12 Already in the first four lines after his proem, Virgil is juxtaposing these two perspectives: Zephyrus helps the farmer by loosening the clods, but the bull must still 'groan' as it toils with the heavy plough. Virgil then interrupts his instructions on ploughing, and advises the farmer first to find out what kind of crop his land is suitable for, since different areas and different regions of the world differ in their capacities. Once again, the language is highly Lucretian, recalling the theme of natural limits which runs through the DRN.13 But Virgil traces these limitations back to a mythological aetion, the repopulation of the world by Deucalion, after the flood. The myth is Hesiodic14 (although it does not occur in the Works and days ); but, once again, the vocabulary is Lucretian. In his account of early man, Lucretius attributes his toughness to the fact that he was born of earth:</page><page sequence="5">40 MONICA GALE at genus humanum fuit illud in aruis durius, ut decuit, tellus quod dura creasset (5.925-6) [But the human race living on the land was then much tougher, as was natural, since the hard earth had created it.] This amounts to a demythologized version of the Hesiodic and Pindaric pun on Axxóç ('race') and Xãaç ('stone').15 But Virgil reverses the process of demythologization by echoing Lucretius' durius/dura , while reintroducing the mythological figure Deucalion.16 This remythologization is effected by conflating the Hesiodic and Lucretian accounts of the birth of men from the earth. Virgil deals next with crop-rotation (including a pseudo-scientific/Lucretian account of the effects of stubble-burning17) and follows it up with another Hesiodic and very anti-Lucretian image, blonde Ceres looking down with favour from Olympus on the man who is assiduous in hoeing and cross-ploughing.18 This then leads up, after a paragraph on irrigation, to the famous passage describing the end of the Golden Age and Jupiter's imposition of labor on mankind. This is perhaps the most controversial section of the whole poem.19 Critics have argued endlessly over the tone of the passage: is Virgil lamenting or celebrating the end of the Golden Age and the introduction of labori Does the catalogue of discoveries in 136-45 constitute a celebration of human ingenuity and progress, or is it more ambivalent? And, perhaps most controversial of all, what is the precise significance of the phrase labor improbus (145-6)? Once again, intertextuality and the conflation of models offer some valuable hints as to how we might go about answering these questions. The Golden Age is a very common theme in both Greek and Latin literature, but once again the main models here are Hesiod and Lucretius. Hesiod offers two explanations for the necessity to work: the 'degeneration' of humanity expressed in the Myth of Ages, and Zeus' s punishment for Prometheus' theft of fire. Virgil combines the two: his account of the pre-Jovian age recalls Hesiod' s Golden Age,20 But the way the account is introduced (we might paraphrase, 'it is necessary to work hard because Jupiter brought the life of leisure to an end') corresponds to the beginning of the Prometheus story.21 This is reinforced by the phrase abstrusum ... ignem in 135, which recalls the hiding of fire by Hesiod's Zeus.22 But there are two crucial differences from the Hesiodic account. For Hesiod, a£QYÍT1 is ultimately a desirable state, as we see from the introduction to the Prometheus myth and the description of the Golden Age. But in the Iron Age, work is vital and àeçyír] is reprehensible, as Hesiod says explicitly in Op. 3 1 1 : eqyov ô5 oi&gt;ôèv oveiôoç, àeQYÍTl ôé ť ov£iôoç. Virgil collapses this distinction by having Jupiter end the Golden Age in order to bring an end to sloth, grauis ueternus , rather than to punish mankind. We are, then, left in some doubt whether work is a good thing or not. On the one hand, the picture of the pre-Jovian age is based on Hesiod's nostalgic primitivism. On the other, Jupiter is now apparently acting rather like the Stoic Zeus, to benefit mankind - it seems particularly significant that he is referred to as pater in 121. 23</page><page sequence="6">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 4 1 Something rather similar seems to be going on in 145-6. Initially, the epigram labor omnia uicit sounds positive and hopeful - until we come up against the adjective improbus at the beginning of the next line. The enjambment makes the word both startling and emphatic, qualifying the sense of the previous line. But what precisely does improbus mean? Judging from other occurrences in Virgil, the nearest English equivalent would be something like 'insatiable' : it is often used of predatory animals, with a shade of pity for the victim.24 An obvious Greek equivalent would be oxexXxq, which is of course used by Hesiod in distinguishing the two Erides in the opening lines of the Works and days.25 But Virgil has once again collapsed the Hesiodic opposition. There is no longer a good Eris which inspires competition and thus work, and a bad Eris which inspires hateful and unproductive strife. For Virgil, there is simply labor , with all the ambivalence the word entails. Agricultural work is labor improbus , carried on under the aegis of "Eqiç oxexkiq, and the neat oppositions of Hesiod' s world are no longer possible. The passage is further complicated by a series of allusions to Lucretius. The main model is Lucretius' culture-history at the end of book 5, which itself alludes extensively to Hesiod. In describing the first phase of human prehistory, Lucretius alternately demythologizes and debunks the Hesiodic Golden Age: early man lived off the spon- taneous fruits of the earth (acorns and arbutus), but enjoyed neither peace nor long life; there was no agriculture and no war, but people often starved to death or poisoned themselves through ignorance.26 This stage was followed by the gradual development of civilization, a highly ambiguous process in Lucretius' eyes. Beneficial devel- opments such as agriculture and language were inevitably accompanied by negative developments such as weapons and religion. Virgil echoes the gradual nature of the development (in highly Lucretian language27) and perhaps the ambiguity of some of the discoveries: fallere in 139 sounds a little dubious, and ferri rigor (143) may hint at the rigours of the iron age.28 But the real counterpoise to the hopeful tone of the catalogue is the Lucretian idea that some 'progress' is necessary just to maintain the status quo , because the earth itself is in decline. This idea is prominent at the end of book 2 and in the anti-teleological argument of book 5: in both places, Lucretius emphasizes the need for endless agricultural toil, and both passages are echoed by Virgil at the beginning and end of the 'aetiology of labor' : nec tarnen, haec cum sint hominumque boumque labores uersando terram experti, nihil improbus anser Strymoniaeque grues et amaris intiba fibris officiunt aut umbra nocet. (1.11 8-2 1 ) [Yet even when the labours of men and oxen have tried all these things in ploughing the earth, the insatiable goose and Strymonian cranes and chicory with its bitter roots do damage, and shade is harmful.]</page><page sequence="7">42 MONICA GALE mox et frumentis labor additus, ut mala culmos 150 esset robigo segnisque horreret in aruis Carduus; intereunt segetes, subit aspera silua, lappaeque tribollique, interque nitentia culta infelix lolium et steriles dominantur auenae (1.150-4)29 [Soon toil was imposed on the cultivation of grain too, so that evil mildew consumed the ears, and the idle thistle sprang up in the fields; the crops perish and a rough undergrowth of goose-grass and thorns grows up, and, amidst the shining plough-land, unfruitful darnel and sterile wild oats hold sway.] The Lucretian theory of natural decline thus frames the Hesiodic Golden Age and the Stoicizing reference to Jupiter's providential care, and we are presented with three possible views of the situation in a single passage. But it is, of course, important that Virgil attributes the whole sequence of development to the gods. Jupiter ends the Golden Age and inspires human beings to gradual development of the arts.30 These developments also coexist with divine benefaction, another very un-Lucretian touch. The whole of Lucretius' culture-history is an implicit denial of the rôle of divine heuretai in the growth of civilization. Natura creatrix 31 replaces Ceres as the motivating force behind the development of agriculture. But Virgil emphatically reinstates her: prima Ceres ferro mortales uertere terram I instituit. The reversal is pointed with further Lucretian echoes.32 To recapitulate: the 'aetiology of labor ' echoes the incompatible versions of Hesiod and Lucretius, adopting some elements from both accounts, and pointedly reversing others. The wonderful age of ease and leisure was ended by Zeus - but in order to benefit, not punish mankind. Work is a good thing (in view of graui ueterno) and a bad thing (in view of improbus ): the two Hesiodic Erides are one. The world is in decline - but that does not prove Lucretius' contention that the gods are not in control. The arts were gradually developed by human beings - but Zeus and Ceres were behind the process. The gods both give and take away. Work is a necessary evil and a sign of the providential organization of the world. What are we to make of this tangle? Virgil is perhaps suggesting that the Hesiodic, Lucretian and Stoic interpretations of history and civilization are all possible ways of viewing the world, none of which finally excludes the others, although they cannot be fully harmonized. A similarly ambivalent world- view is developed in two contrasting passages which span the end of the 'works' section of book 1 and the beginning of the 'days' section.33 The first (176-203) arises out of the poet's instructions for building a threshing-floor: once again, pests are a threat, and seeds must be hand-picked to counteract the tendency of everything in nature to go to the bad. The farmer is like an oarsman rowing against the current: it takes all the rowing he can do to stay in the same place. The train of thought here is familiar: Virgil is in fact following fairly closely the Lucretian argument</page><page sequence="8">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 43 that nature is in terminal decline, and once again, the allusion is 'flagged' with direct echoes of Lucretius' text.34 But this pro-Lucretian stance (so to speak) is balanced by the second passage (231-56), in which Virgil describes the five celestial zones. This time, the Virgilian passage reverses Lucretius, by conflating his account of the zones with other models. The description of the zones itself is quite a close imitation of a passage from Eratosthenes' Hermes ,35 but the Lucretian passage is bound to be in our minds, because Virgil has already referred to it several times: it is in fact part of the anti-teleological argument of DRN 5.195ff., and comes immediately before the lines in which Lucretius describes the problems caused by weeds and weather conditions, one of the major models for the 'aetiology of labor' and for the account of natural degeneration discussed above. In other words, our pair of passages, one 'pessimistic' and the other 'optimistic' both invoke the same Lucretian model. Virgil again points this allusion by dropping Lucretian phrases into his Eratosthenic framework. Most strikingly, the temperate zones are said to have been granted by the gods to mortalibus aegris , where Eratosthenes simply says that they are inhabited by âvÔQeç àvtíjioôeç.36 The same phrase is used by Lucretius in a context of 'divine' benefaction - the proem to book 6, where the godlike Epicurus is praised as the saviour of mankind. Once again, Virgil undoes Lucretius' displacement of the gods from their traditional rôle as benefactors. The zones were also described by Aratus, who is echoed a few lines later in 243-6.37 For Aratus, the celestial zones seem to constitute an example of Zeus' s providential concern for mankind, since he emphasizes their 'usefulness' (462) and the perfection of their design (529-33).38 In effect, Lucretius has appropriated the Stoic argument that the perfection of the world proves the existence of divine providence and stood it on its head, by using the zones as evidence against divine providence (only a fifth of the earth is habitable). Virgil turns this around again, emphasizing the gods' beneficence, to counterbalance the Lucretian tone of the earlier passage. Once again, Virgil offers both Lucretian rationalism and Aratean providentialism side by side as plausible ways of viewing the world. The passage continues with an almost explicit contradiction of Lucretius, as Virgil muses on the nature of the antipodes.39 Whatever the precise meaning of 242-3, it is fairly clear that the Underworld is said to be somewhere beneath our feet. One of the reasons for the odd phrasing is surely that Virgil is echoing Lucretius, who, in the proem to book 3, describes the effects of Epicurus' philosophy in terms of a vision: he can see beneath his feet everything that is going on in the whole universe, but the Underworld (which does not exist) is nowhere to be seen 40 Elsewhere, Lucretius ridicules the idea that anyone might live on the underside of the earth.41 Virgil offers alternatives: either they live in perpetual darkness (like Homer's Cimmerians42), or they have daylight while we have night, and vice versa. This idea is developed into a picturesque pageant: Aurora leading the day, the rising Sun with his snorting chariot- team, Vesper lighting his lamp in the evening. We might be tempted to dismiss the lines as a slight elaboration on the standard epic dawn-formula; but the procession may</page><page sequence="9">44 MONICA GALE be more than simply a decorative allusion to Homer and his successors. Once again, Virgil is repopulating the universe with the gods whom Lucretius had banished. The sun' s chariot and Aurora both figure implicitly in a passage in book 5 (650-9), in which Lucretius discusses the causes of day and night: at nox obruit ingenti caligine terras, 650 aut ubi e longo cursu sol ultima caeli impulit atque suos efflauit languidus ignis concussos itere et labefactos aere multo, aut quia sub terras cursum conuertere cogit uis eadem, supra quae terras pertulit orbem. 655 Tempore item certo roseam Matuta per oras aetheris auroram differt et lumina pandit, aut quia sol idem, sub terras ille reuertens, anticipât caelum radiis accendere temptans, aut quia conueniunt ignes . . . [But night overwhelms the earth with its huge darkness, either when after his long course the sun has reached the end of the sky and wearily breathed out his fires, exhausted by their journey and weakened by their long voyage through the air; or because he is compelled to turn back his course beneath the earth by the same force which carried his orb above it. Likewise, Matuta spreads the rosy dawn through the etherial regions and shows her light at a fixed time either because the same sun, returning beneath the earth, first seizes the heavens with his rays and tries to set them aflame, or because fires come together . . .] This is an example of Lucretius' usual demythologizing technique, described above: mythological imagery is used in a context in which the true, Epicurean explanation for the phenomena is being given, and the juxtaposition both enlivens the atomistic account and helps to suggest how the myth might have grown up (the dawn is like a lamp, the sun travels across the sky like a charioteer). But the Virgilian context seems to suggest that taking the images more literally may be as satisfactory a way of accounting for the phenomena: the gods, or Providence, may be behind it all after all.43 2. Remythologization The procession of day and night is thus an example of my second category of mytho- logical allusion, remythologization. The problem with Lucretius' use of mythological imagery is that the process can easily be reversed. If the sun behaves like the mytho- logical charioteer, might that not be because it is really controlled by the gods? Lucretius tries to avoid this problem by juxtaposing myth with reality and thus</page><page sequence="10">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 45 emphasizing the artificiality of his own images. But the effect of Virgil's remythol- ogizing is once again to blur and problematize the clear and certain contours of the Epicurean universe. We have already seen some examples of this. The myths of Deucalion and of the Golden Age are reintroduced by Virgil in conjunction with Lucretian language and ideas, presenting us with a problematic account of human pre-history. I shall now turn to two further examples, the autumn storm in 1.311-34 and the praise of spring in 2.323^45, which again form a contrasting pair. In the first passage, Virgil describes how autumn storms lay low the ripe corn and terrify man and beast. The language here is very reminiscent of Lucretius' atomistic accounts of bad weather in books 1 and 6 of the DRN.U The battle of winds is a metaphor going back to Homer,45 but the detailed working-out in this passage seems specifically reminiscent of Lucretius.46 But Virgil one again reverses the implications of the Lucretian passages. For Lucretius, the natural world is impersonal and indifferent to human life, and the violent forces of nature are often used to illustrate this indif- ference.47 The thunderbolt, in particular, is not the weapon of Jupiter, as Lucretius argues at some length in book 6. 48 But Lucretius retains the image of the thunderbolt as a weapon, hinting that the mythological explanation contains an element of truth. Thunderbolts are 'forged' in the clouds (6. 148-9, 278 and 365) and then 'hurled' down to earth (328-9); but the agencies involved are wind, moisture and fire, not gods. Virgil complicates the picture in several ways. Firstly, he reinstates Jupiter, as the Lucretian image of the battle of winds merges into the traditional idea that the thun- derbolt is wielded by Jupiter, rather than the impersonal tempestas : ipse pater media nimborum in nocte corusca fulmina molitur dextra, quo maxima motu terra tremit, fugere ferae et mortalia corda 330 per gentis humilis strauit pauor; ille flagranti aut Atho aut Rhodopen aut alta Ceraunia telo deicit; ingeminant Austri et densissimus imber (1.328-33) [The father himself, in the midst of the clouds' darkness, wields thunderbolts in his flashing right hand. The great earth trembles at the impact; wild beasts flee and grovelling terror lays low men's hearts throughout the world: he, with his blazing weapons, casts down Athos or Rhodope or tall Ceraunia; the winds and pouring rain redouble ...] By personalizing Lucretius' ambivalent view of nature, as both creative and destructive, Virgil leaves us with a deeply unsettling image of the workings of divine providence.49 Virgil's natura , like Lucretius', is often indifferent to man, but Virgil does not draw the Lucretian conclusion, that the gods therefore have no concern with human beings. Instead, Jupiter is himself made responsible for the violent as well as</page><page sequence="11">46 MONICA GALE the kindly aspect of the natural world. Furthermore, there is no suggestion that Jupiter is punishing mortal wrongdoing, as in the striking Homeric simile which forms a secondary model for the Virgilian storm.50 Virgil's farmers are apparently innocent victims of Jupiter's caprice.51 Secondly, the literal storm anticipates the storm of civil war at the end of the book, where Roman battle lines 'run together' (« concurrere ) like the winds of 318. Thus, Virgil hints that natural violence and human violence are connected by a kind of cosmic sympathy, calling into question the Lucretian view that, while violent conflict is inherent in nature, conflict on the human level arises directly from ambition and fear, and can thus be 'cured' by Epicurus' dicta.52 And thirdly, the Lucretian passage is immediately followed by the famous advice in primis uenerare deos , and a description of the Cerealia, which contains several reminiscences of Hesiodic passages.53 Thus, the Hesiodic view that hard work and piety will be rewarded is brought into conflict with the Lucretian view that the gods have no concern with human beings. Both views are problematized. Virgil accepts both the idea that the innocent suffer with the guilty and the idea that the gods demand and respond to worship, and thus leaves us with a complex and troubling picture of the gods' rela- tionship with man and the natural world. Jupiter's destructive rôle in the storm in book 1 is balanced by his rôle in the praise of spring, where he comes down in showers54 to fertilize Mother Earth and nourish all living things. Again, the passage is a tissue of Lucretian echoes. The hieros gamos of Earth and Sky is evoked and demythologized in DRN 1.250-1 and 2.991-7; the onset of spring is described in the Venus proem; and the spring-like conditions which prevailed at the time when animals and men were first born of earth are an important element in Lucretius' zoogony (5.780-820). All four passages are recalled here.55 But one again, Virgil makes the mildness of spring a gift of the gods: caeli indulgentia in 345 seems deliberately ambiguous, and Aether, Tellus and Venus are not explicitly rationalized as they are by Lucretius.56 Further ambiguities persist: even the praise of spring is not a straightforward acknowledgement of the existence of a kindly Providence. Here, both intertextuality and self-allusion are important. I have already mentioned the pairing of the passage with the more troubling view of Jupiter in 1 .3 1 1-34. The birth of animals and men also looks back to Deucalion's stones57 and the 'aetiology of labor'. The zoogony here differs from the earlier passages in three important ways. Firstly, it seems more 'scientific', with its strong reminiscences of Lucretius' zoogony. Secondly, the new- born animals are no longer a durum genus , but res tenerne, and could not survive without the kindly indulgence of heaven. And finally, the eůxQaoia of spring here seems explicitly to contradict the statement in 1.311 that violent storms occur in autumn and spring. In addition, the positive view of animal sexuality here conflicts with the violent attack on amor in book 3. 58 Do these contradictions make the praise of spring a 'lie' , as Ross and Thomas argue? Or do they invalidate the earlier passages? Once again, I prefer to see an example of polyphony or multiple points of view,</page><page sequence="12">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 47 particularly as precisely the same 'contradictions' occur in Lucretius. Spring is a mild and indulgent season in the proem and (less explicitly) in 1.803-1 1 and 5.737-40, but the time when thunderstorms are most prevalent in 6.357-78. Early man is durus , but enjoys a mild climate.59 Animal sexuality is harmless and necessary in the proem, but human sexuality is dangerous and problematic in book 4.60 Virgil simply draws attention to and exaggerates Lucretius' equivocation in order once again to prob- lematize his model.61 A final example of this kind of remythologization occurs in the finale to book 1, where Virgil describes the horrific portents which followed the murder of Caesar and presaged the battle of Philippl. The whole catalogue can be seen to a certain extent as alluding to the sixth book of the DRN , where Lucretius' main object is to demonstrate that frightening phenomena such as earthquakes, lightning, volcanoes and plagues are not manifestations of divine displeasure, but perfectly natural occurrences which are subject to a rational, mechanistic explanation.62 The idea that thunder and lightning may be used for divination is explicitly ridiculed in 6.379-86. Most of the portents in Virgil's list are discussed by Lucretius,63 but the most striking example is the eruption of Aetna in 471-3: quotiens Cyclopum efferuere in agros uidimus undantem ruptis fornacibus Aetnam, flammarumque globos liquefactaque uoluere saxa! [How many times we saw Aetna boil over and pour lava from cracked furnaces into fields of the Cyclopes, hurling up balls of flame and molten rocks!] This recalls Lucretius' two descriptions of Aetna, in books 1 and 6, 64 both of which contain implicit references to the mythical inhabitants of the mountain. In book 1, rumbling noises which come from the mountain threaten that it is once again working up its anger, and will soon hurl its fires up at the heavens. The language recalls the myth of Typhoeus, the giant imprisoned by Zeus beneath the mountain, as described, for example, in the Prometheus bound : evOev èxQayf|oovxaí jioxe jioxafxoi jtuqòç ôcurxovxeç àyQÍaiç yváOoiç 370 xr]ç xakkixáQJtou Zixekíaç keuQobç yóaç* xoióvôe Tuqpcbç è^avaÇéaei /okov OeQpoiç àjrkáxou ßekeai jtuqjtvóou Çákqç (PV 369-73) [Thence rivers of fire shall one day break out, devouring with savage jaws the level fields of fertile Sicily; so fiercely shall Typho's rage boil up, with hot darts of terrible, fiery rain.]</page><page sequence="13">48 MONICA GALE This allusion ties in with a whole complex of imagery which is applied to the figure of Epicurus throughout the DRN : he is represented as attacking heaven like the giants, with the purpose of overthrowing the gods of mythology.65 Lucretius reverses the traditional moral which was drawn from the myth throughout antiquity: rather than representing hybris , disorder and barbarity, the 'giants' have become heroic figures, challenging and overthrowing the tyranny of religio. The description of Aetna in book 1 is part of Lucretius' tribute to Empédocles, who is thus aligned with the Epicureans against religious tradition (though of course Lucretius goes on to emphasize that the whole basis of his physical theory was fundamentally flawed).66 In book 6, the reference is to another myth associated with Aetna, the home not only of Typhoeus but also of the Cyclopes, who labour here forging thunderbolts for Zeus.67 The idea is latent in Lucretius' account of volcanic eruption, just as the figure of Jupiter the Thunderer is latent in his account of thunder and lightning. In 6.68 1 , the poet speaks of 'the furnace of Aetna', and in fact the mountain turns out to behave rather like a forge or furnace, with the action of wind in underground caverns fanning its flames. In a word, the Cyclopes and their forge have been demythologized. Virgil seems to combine these two passages in his version and also to refer back through Lucretius to the prophecy of Aeschylus' Prometheus. Cyclopum ... agros and fornacibus recall the passage in DRN 6, while the bursting of the mountain and hurling of rocks suggest that Typhoeus has escaped his prison, just as Prometheus prophesied. Virgil, then, has both remythologized Lucretius and restored the conventional moral value to the myth. Typhoeus no longer stands for the heroic philosopher, but is now a symbol of cosmic disorder, his escape presaging the terrible punishment of the Laomedonteae periura Troiae which Virgil identifies as the ultimate cause of the Civil Wars in 502. 3. Extension The myths of Typhoeus and the Cyclopes, like most of those we have been considering so far, might be described as 'nature myths'. Whatever their origins, they were by Virgil's day firmly associated with volcanic eruptions and thunderbolts, just as Ceres is associated with the growth of crops and Prometheus with the discovery of fire. Thus Lucretius is able to demythologize them by explaining the phenomena in a different, 'scientific', way. There are two further classes of myths, however, which he treats rather differently: myths of metamorphosis and composite monsters (centaurs, scyllas, the Chimaera). Like many of his contemporaries,68 Lucretius is inclined simply to dismiss these stories as nonsensical. Throughout the DRN, the species are regarded as fixed and unchanging, with their own distinct characteristics.69 Although nature's laboratory must initially have produced some rejects, which died out because they were not fitted for survival (5.855-77), this does not amount to a process of natural selection in the Darwinian sense, in which the characteristics of species actually change to adapt</page><page sequence="14">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 49 to their environment. How, then, could a man and a horse possibly exist in the same body, when their physiological characteristics are so different (5.878-924)? Of course, such myths did not simply spring up out of nowhere, and Lucretius does offer in passing one or two suggestions as to their origins: explicitly in book 4.732^18, where he gives the usual Epicurean account of simulacra sticking together in flight, and, implicitly, earlier in the same book (129^10), where he describes how cloud pictures sometimes resemble giants and huge rocks blotting out the sun, and are transformed into one monstrous form after another. More often, though, giants, chimaerae and centaurs and myths of metamorphosis simply figure as adynata : if something could come of nothing, nature should be able to produce gigantic beings who could walk across the sea; if just any kind of atom could combine with any other, all kinds of portentous creatures and metamorphoses would be possible; if the atoms had colour as well as shape, every species should occur in every colour, and we would see white ravens and black swans.70 4 All of which' , remarks Lucretius drily (in 2.707), 'evidently does not happen.' It seems significant, then, that references to these two kinds of myths - monstrous creatures and metamorphoses - are relatively common in the Georgics. No doubt this is due in part to the Alexandrian fascination with the bizarre and monstrous, manifested, for example, in Nicander' s lost Heteroioumena. But the link with Lucretius also seems important, and Virgil himself points us in this direction by marking two of the relevant passages with clear verbal allusions. Both passages occur in Geo. 3, which is the most Lucretian part of the poem. It revolves around the themes of amor and death, recalling the finales of the two central books of the DRN, and the plague at the end of book 6. As numerous critics have noted,71 it is also remarkable for the extreme anthropomorphism of Virgil's treatment of the animals. These two issues are, I think, related: Lucretius, too, repeatedly emphasizes the fundamental kinship between animals and human beings.72 But where for Lucretius the relationship is physical - man and animals are similar in their make- up, and in their most basic drives and desires, indeed, before the dawn of civilization, early man behaves exactly like any other animal - for Virgil the relationship is more metaphorical. Man is akin to animals, in two slightly different senses. Firstly, he shares their vulnerability to age, disease, injury, death. From this point of view, Virgil's anthropomorphism evokes sympathy for the animals, even when their sufferings are the result of the advice which the poet himself is offering the farmer. But secondly, man is dangerously close to the beasts, in the sense that his civilization is merely a thin veneer, which easily cracks when subjected to the forces of passion or disease. In these circumstances, man becomes an animal - like the anonymous iuuenis and uirgo amongst the list of animals driven to extreme and unnatural behaviour by the power of amor, or the Norici reduced to pulling their wagons and ploughs because of the dire effects of the plague.73 Lucretius' optimism is once again challenged: if passion and violence are part of the fundamental nature which is common to men and animals, how can human beings hope to attain happiness by the sheer force of reason?</page><page sequence="15">50 MONICA GALE This blurring of the boundary between man and animal is symbolically reinforced by the two references to myths of metamorphosis which I mentioned a moment ago. Virgil's description of the ideal horse culminates in a short list of exemplary mytho- logical horses, the steeds of Pollux, Mars and Achilles, and the horse into which Saturn transformed himself to avoid Rhea's anger during his courtship of Phillyra. There is a touch of humour in the picture of the god's swift flight from his angry wife, but the passage also anticipates the central 'diatribe' on the power of amor. Sexual passion (symbolically) transforms men and even gods into animals.74 A little later, discussing the danger which gadflies represent to pregnant cows, Virgil introduces a second, rather similar myth, the transformation of Io and her persecution by Juno (152-3). Again, the metamorphosis is the result of sexual passion and sexual jealousy.75 In both cases, Virgil introduces clear echoes of Lucretian passages. He describes the horses of Mars and Achilles with the phrase quorum Grai meminere poetae (90), which recalls the 'distancing formula', Graium ut cecinere poetae (6.754; slightly varied in 2.600 and 5.405), used three times by Lucretius in rejecting the myths of Cybele, Phaethon and Minerva's hatred of the crow. The gadfly is described in the phrase asper , acerba sonans (149), taken from Lucretius' ironic account of the labours of Hercules in the proem to DRN 5, where the serpent of the Hesperides is asper , acerba tuens (5.33).76 Virgil is taking up the myths dismissed by Lucretius, and by implication, applying to them the kind of 'allegorical' explanation Lucretius had applied to the nature myths. The 'inner meaning' of the stories of Saturn and Io is to be deduced from the context: passion erases the narrow boundary between men and animals. It may not be literally possible for a man to turn into a beast, but on the symbolic level, it is all too easy. This interpretation can be reinforced by looking at two further examples from book 3. The catalogue of violent animal behaviour culminates in a mythological exemplum : the horses of Glaucus, which, maddened by Venus, devoured their owner (266-8).77 Not precisely a metamorphosis, but certainly an extreme example of unnatural behaviour, the very opposite of the stereotypical and predictable behaviour of animals in Lucretius.78 Again, the transformation of man into animal by the plague is pointed by mythological allusion. Echoing Lucretius' (and Thucydides') statement that the medical profession was helpless in the face of the epidemic, Virgil says that even the experts, Phillyrides Chiron and Amythaonius Melampus , gave up hope.79 Why these specific names? Of course both Chiron and Melampus were famous healers. But both are also connected with metamorphosis myths: Chiron was the offspring of Phillyra and horse-Saturn, as Virgil reminds us with the resounding patronymic. Melampus cured the Proetides of the madness that made them believe that they were cows, alluded to by Virgil in Eclogue 6.80 It is ironic that neither the man-horse nor the healer of the women-cows is able to cure the disease which reduces the Norici to the level of their animals. The failure of medicine in Lucretius is in its own way symbolic:81 the benefits of civilization are fragile and partial, compared with the true healing conferred by Epicurus' philosophy. Virgil has shifted the emphasis and integrated the line into the symbolism of his own poem.</page><page sequence="16">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 5 1 I have suggested that monsters and metamorphoses are most prominent in Georgics 3, because of its close engagement with Lucretius and its emphasis on the maddening, debasing effects of sex and disease. There are, however, several examples in the other three books. The significance of these references is not always as clear as in book 3, but they are generally associated with passion (especially sexual passion) and violence, and can thus be seen as building up towards the symbolic transformations of book 3. In any case, they serve to blur the boundary between man and the natural world, which is otherwise emphasized by the farmer's dominance and control over his crops and livestock. The most explicit examples are references to Nisus and Scylla in book 1, Procne in book 4, the giants, again in book 1, and the centauromachy in book 2. The first two (1.404-9 and 4.15-17) are relatively straightforward: the birds are given their human names,82 and in each case there is a brief, allusive reference to the reason for the meta- morphosis (Scylla' s betrayal of her father, Procne' s murder of her child). Once again, both stories connect metamorphosis with sexual passion and violence. The story of Procne and Philomela also has more extensive resonances: it is referred to again in the Aristaeus epyllion (4.511-18), where Orpheus' lamentations for Eurydice are compared to Philomela's lamentations. Here, however, Philomela is lamenting the loss of her nestlings, which have been taken from the nest by a dur us arator. This in turn looks back to the vignette in 2.207-1 1 of the iratus arator , who cuts down an old tree to clear plough land, thus depriving birds of their 'ancient homes', but putting the land to use which is attractive in itself. The three passages, taken together, hint at a cycle of violence in both nature and agriculture, which is cruel but necessary. Philomela (or Procne) murders her child to punish her husband. Transformed into a bird, she cruelly carries off bees to feed to her young (in expiation for her previous crime?), but in turn loses them at the hands of the farmer. The farmer deprives birds of their home - but the end result is 'shining' and useful plough land, which will ultimately 'learn'83 to produce new life. This may remind us of the cycle of birth and death which dominates Lucretius' poem; but Virgil's delicate personification of animals and plants tends always to evoke sympathy for the victims rather than calm acceptance of the inevitable equilibrium of creation and destruction. The centaurs are invoked at the end of book 2 (455-7) as an exemplum of the detrimental effects of wine. Again, they are associated with frenzy84 and violence, and perhaps suggest the precariousness of civilization, since Virgil is here contrasting the virtues of uncultivated trees with the cultivated vine. If so, Virgil is using an un- Lucretian symbol to convey a very Lucretian idea: Lucretius is also keen to emphasize the possibility of social collapse, especially in the plague at the end of book 6.85 The gigantomachy has already been mentioned above, as implicit in Virgil's description of the eruption of Aetna at the end of book 1. The giants, it was suggested, stand for the forces of chaos and disorder, as they so frequently do in classical literature. This allusion, and the reversal of Lucretius' symbolism which it entails, links with two further references earlier in the book. The first is implicit: the pests which destroy the</page><page sequence="17">52 MONICA GALE threshing-floor are 'earth-born monsters', quae plurima terrae I monstra ferunt (1.184-5). 'Earth-born monsters' would most naturally refer to the giants.86 Pace Thomas, there is some humour in equating mice and ants with huge monsters; but again humour is combined with thematic significance. The earth is full of destructive forces which undo the order which the farmer tries to impose, as the poet emphasizes in the image of the rower fighting against the current. The giants are referred to again (with perhaps a touch of humour87) in Virgil's brief adaptation of Hesiod's Days , 1.276-86. Here, they are conspirators united in a desire to tear down the heavens.88 Again they figure as opponents of civilization, born on an unlucky day, though this time they are defeated by Jupiter. Examples could be multiplied. Many latent references to myth are assiduously hunted out by Servius, and Frentz, in his monograph Mythologisches in Vergils Geórgica , discusses no fewer than twenty possible allusions to plant and animal meta- morphoses and catasterisms. Some of his examples are more convincing than others: when Virgil gives the spider the epithet inuisa Mineruae in 4.246-7, it seems reasonable to detect a reference to the metamorphosis of Arachne, and halcyons are perhaps 'dear to Thetis' (1.399) for a similar reason.89 But many will doubt that the simple phrase Parnasia laurus (2.18) can be expected to evoke the story of Daphne. The difficulty lies in deciding what is mythological allusion and what is simply person- ification: phrases like 'the tears of Narcissus' (4.160) or 'the Bears that are afraid to dip themselves in Ocean' (1.246) could be regarded as either. In the long run, the distinction may be unimportant: the cumulative effect of both personification and references to metamorphosis myths is to emphasize the interconnectedness of the natural world, the resemblances between plants, animals and man. As I have suggested, this 'interconnectedness' is also an important principle for Lucretius, but Virgil has transformed its significance. Lucretius' readily explicable, mechanistic and materi- alistic world of atoms and void has become something much more mysterious and threatening, where the violent forces of nature and emotion can transform man into beast, and where the farmer's struggle to maintain order brings suffering, as well as benefit, to animals, plants and the land itself. At the beginning of this paper, I raised three related problems: how should we interpret the apparent contradiction in the double makarismos at the end of book 2? Is Virgil's major model Hesiod, Lucretius or Callimachus and the Alexandrians? And is the work gloomy and anti- Augustan or celebratory and pro- Augustan? My discussion of Virgil's use of myth has, I hope, suggested that none of these questions has a simple answer. Although I see Lucretius as Virgil's main model, in the sense that the DRN is the text with which Virgil engages most consistently throughout the poem, allusions to the other models are also woven into the Georgics , particularly in book 1, in such a way that their conflicting world-views are emphasized, rather than glossed over. Virgil offers us fragmentary glimpses of an ambiguous world, seen through the mirror of one model after another. Their conflicting points of view cannot be fully reconciled, but each of them proves equally adequate (or inadequate) as an explanation for the</page><page sequence="18">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 53 phenomena. It is possible to see the natural world as fruitful or barren, the gods as kindly or cruel, the farmer's life as an ideal or as hopelessly compromised by violence and failure, simply by a change in perspective. The complex, shifting world-view of the Georgics is intimately bound up with its place in the didactic tradition, a tradition in which a succession of poets had each offered their own model of the nature of reality, of man's relationship with the world, the gods and other men. Rather than presenting yet another new interpretation of the phenomena - or rather, as a means of doing so - Virgil's poem offers a commentary on the tradition, and on the conflicting values of the poets who shaped it. Some critics have denied that the Georgics is really 'about' agriculture at all. That is, I think, a mistake; but it is also concerned with the rerum natura , with man's place in the world, and with the didactic tradition itself. ROYAL HOLLOWAY, LONDON MONICA GALE NOTES 1. Some critics have denied that the lines refer specifically to Lucretius (see e. g. Boyancé (1980), Novara (1982), Thomas (1988)). The concentration of Lucretian language in 475-92, however, makes the reference certain. Cf. Hardie (1986) 33-51. 2. The main representatives of the former view are Otis (1964), Wilkinson (1969) and (with some qualifi- cations) Mynors (1990). The latter view has been more popular in recent years: see especially Putnam (1979), Miles (1980), Ross (1987), Thomas (1988). 3. For Virgil and Hesiod, see especially Wilkinson (1969) 56-60; for Virgil and Lucretius, Farrington (1958) and (1963), Buchheit (1972) and Nethercut (1973); for Virgil, Callimachus and Homer, Thomas (1986) and (1988), and Farrell (1991). 4.

Cf. 1 .926-50 = 4. 1-25. The 'bitterness' of the philosophy consists both in its demand for asceticism and rejection of the 'worldly goods' described in the proem to book 2, and in its abstract, impersonal view of the cosmos (cf. De Lacy (1957), Wardy (1988), Gale (1994) 144-5). On the psychagogic power of poetry and myth, see also Schrijvers (1970) 27-60. 8. Exactly how long the reader will have to wait is determined in part by the textual problem at lines 44-9. Even if the lines are accepted as genuine, however, the process of enlightenment is still a gradual one. The reader is temporarily left either with a misleading image or with a blatant contradiction, which will be resolved only by a gradual process of substitution, as Venus' functions are taken over by Natura and Epicurus. For a more detailed account (and further bibliography) see Gale (1994) 208-23. 9. See especially 2.11 05-74, where Lucretius describes how the earth was created and brought to completion by nature ( donee ad extremum crescendi perfica finem I omnia perduxit rerum natura ere at rix, 1 1 16-17), and is now on the way to inevitable collapse and destruction ( sic igitur magni quoque circum moenia mundi I expugnata dabunt labem putris&lt;que&gt; ruinas , 1 144-5).</page><page sequence="19">54 MONICA GALE 10.

It is also worth noting that Lucretius demythologizes the flood in 5.41 1-15, and would of course reject the metamorphosis of stones into men as impossible. (See further below.) 17. Lines 86-93 in general recall the Lucretian/Epicurean principle of citing a plurality of explanations where certainty is impossible (cf. Epic. Ep. ad Pyth. 86-8, DRN 6.703-11). It is notable, however, that Lucretius generally appeals to this principle only when discussing phenomena which are distant in time or space. Virgil's world is much more mysterious and uncertain. More specifically, note that Lucretius generally introduces these multiple explanations with the formulae siue ... siue (e.g. 5.509-33, 575-6 and esp. 1244-9, where the context is similar) or aut quia ... aut quia (e.g. 5.656-65, 680-704). The expla- nations themselves are full of Lucretian language: note especially caeca (89; very common in this sense in Lucretius, e.g. 1.277, 3.316, 3.247, 5.611, 6.1016), ex coquerelpercoquere (88; DRN 6.858 and 962), spiramenta (90) ~ spiracula mundi {DRN 6.493), penetra(bi)le frigus (93 ~ DRN 1.494). More generally, the second explanation recalls Lucretius' accounts of the discovery of metals {DRN 5.1252-7) and the 'sweating out' of the sea from the earth (5.487-8, and cf. maris sudor, 2.465 and saxa ... sudent umore, 6.943), the third recalls his explanation for hot and cold wells (6.830-78) and the fourth recalls numerous references to the drying power of the sun (e.g. 5.215, 252, 389; 6.616-22, 962). 18.

Agriculture (5.1361-78), fire (1091-1104), sailing and astronomy (1435-42), hunting (1250-1) and tools ( 1 266-8) are all discussed by Lucretius. The parenthesis in 144 is strongly reminiscent of Lucretius' style (cf. esp. 1250ff.; and cf. 1283ff., 1297-9, 1350-3). 28. Cf. Thomas ad loc. 29. The salient Lucretian passages are 2. 1 160-3 (quae [sc. crops and livestock] nunc uix nostro grandescunt aucta labore, I conterimusque boues et uiris agricolarum, I conficimus ferrum uix aruis suppeditati: I usque adeo parcunt fetus augentque laborem ) and 5.206-17 (partially quoted at n. 11 above); cf. also 1.208-14.

Cf. also ipsaque tellus I omnia ...ferebat (127-8) and DRN 2.233-4: quando omnibus omnia large I tellus ipsa parit - but it is only animals, not human beings, who get food for nothing in Lucretius. It also seems significant that labor and egestas are paired in DRN 3.65 (a passage echoed by Virgil in Aen. 6.277) as things which are generally thought of as evils, and that one of the harmful discoveries, seafaring, is given the epithet improba in 5.1006. 30. The terms of Jupiter's 'benefaction' in 122-3 recall Lucretius' Epicurus: compare primusque perartem I mouit agros with quique per artem I fluctibus e tantis . . . (DRN 5.9-10; note also that Epicurus is princeps in the previous line, primus in 1.67, 1.71 and 3.2 and pater in 3.9). See further Farrell (1991) 181. Virgil has once again reversed Lucretius, who replaces the traditional divine heuretai with the saviour Epicurus (cf. Gale (1994) 196-9). But it is significant that Jupiter stirs up storms (130) where Epicurus rescues from (metaphorical) storms, and generally makes life harder where Epicurus makes it easy and pleasant. 31. DRN 5.1361-78. Cf. Gale (1994) 178-9. 32. Cf. esp. DRN 5.14-15: Ceres fertur fruges ... mortalibus instituísse (the distancing formula is important). Also 5.934, 1295 and references to glandes and arbuta in 939-42 and 965 (acorns are of course traditional primitive fare - see e.g. Dicaearchus ap. Porph. Abst. 4.1.2, Paus. 8.1.6, Juv. 13.54-5, Macrob. In Somn. Scip. 2.10.6 - but the pairing with arbutus is less common and seems to point specifically to Lucretius). Dodona negarei also seems a pointed reversal of Lucretius' claim that acorns simply went out of fashion (5.1416). 33. Cf. Farrell (1991) 172-80. 34. Cf. especially possum multa tibi ueterum praecepta referre, I ni refugis tenuisque piget cognoscere curas (176-7) with multaque praeterea tibi possum commemorando I argumenta fidem dictis corradere nostris I ...

The latter passage may have suggested the image of the oarsman, if the MS reading</page><page sequence="21">56 MONICA GALE ad scopulum is retained (as I think it should be) in 1 174: cf. Segura Ramos (1982) and Possanza (1990). Other examples of Lucretian vocabulary: uicta fatiscat (cf. fessa fatisci , DRN 3.458 and 5.308 - in both cases referring to degeneration and decay), contemplator item (cf. contemplator enim, DRN 2.114 and 6.189), magna cum magno (cf. esp. DRN 4.902, 5.644; this kind of polyptoton is generally very common in Lucretius, but rare in Virgil, according to Thomas ad loc.), uidi (cf. DRN A. 511 and 6. 1044 and the frequent appeals to common experience throughout the DRN). 35. Fr. 16 Powell. See Thomas ad loc. for details. 36. Note also dextra laeuaque ~ DRN A. 21 6 for èxáxEQÔe and uia secta ~ DRN 5.272 = 6.638 (though in a different sense). It is perhaps also significant that Virgil omits to describe the evxpaoia of the temperate zones (lines 15-19 in Eratosthenes), which are dealt with rather perfunctorily in 237-8 (cf. Thomas ad loc.). This brings his account more closely into line with Lucretius' , where the emphasis is of course on the climatic imbalance in the polar and equatorial zones. 37. Cf. Phaen. 45-8. 38. Phaen. 462-544. For the zones as evidence of the providential design of the cosmos, cf. Heraclit. Quaest. Horn. 48-51, Philo, Quis rer. div. her. 147. The zones were also described by Chrysippus ( SVF 2.649) and Posidonius (Strabo 2.2.1-2). 39. The language of 240-3 is somewhat obscure: Mynors {ad loc.) is more helpful than Thomas. 40. DRN 3.25-7.

Virgil, like Lucretius (cf. Gale (1994) 81-3) may have artistic representations in mind: see for example the chariots of Helios and Nyx/Selene on the East pediment and the North metopes of the Parthenon. 44.

More generally, the destruction of crops in 319-21 recalls the destruction of trees in DRN 1.273-5 (based in turn on a Homeric simile, II. 16.765-70) and 6.140-1, and the fleeing men and animals in 330-1 recall DRN 6.52-3 and 6.330-1 (again modelled on a Homeric passage, II. 4.275-81).

On the theodicy, see Janko (1992), ad loc. For Zeus thundering in autumn, cf. also Op. 415-16. 51. The terror of men and animals in 330-1 is particularly important, because Lucretius' object is to dispel fear of thunderstorms, which he equates with superstitious fear of the gods: see 5.1218-35 and 6.51-5. But in Virgil's version, fear is not confined to human beings (the shuddering beasts perhaps come from Hesiod's description of the month Lenaeon, Op. 516). For Virgil, both animals and human beings have good reason to be afraid of Zeus' s wrath (which cannot be distinguished from the physical effects of the storm). 52.

There is also a striking contrast between diluii in 1.326 and alit in 2.327; tremit in 1 .330 and nec metuit in 2.333. Jupiter is pater in both places (in view of omnipotens, pater Aether in 2.325 must be identified with Jupiter). 55.

There is a more detailed analysis in Klepl (1967) 1 Iff. 56. The personification (if such it is) is much stronger in 325-7 than in either of the Lucretian models; and Lucretius deliberately undermines the image by emphasizing in 2.652-4 and 5.1 10-43 that Tellus is not a goddess, or even alive. On the hieros gamos in Lucretius, see further Schiesaro (1990) 1 1 1-22, Gale (1994) 40-1. 57. Note especially the brief evocation of spring in 1 .43-4, and contrast durum genus ( 1 .63) with res tenerae (2.343). 58. Note especially uere magis in 3.272. 59. DRN 5.818-20. 60. Cf. Gale (1991) 419-21. 61. It should perhaps be emphasized that this equivocation on Lucretius' part need not be seen as inherently problematic. Unlike Virgil, Lucretius represents the world as fully explicable on rational principles, despite its complex and multi-faceted nature. Creation and destruction are two sides of the same coin (as is made explicit on several occasions, e.g. 2.569-80); and though the poet may sometimes emphasize one aspect over the other, in accordance with the immediate demands of his argument, he will almost always provide a complementary passage which rights the balance. The most striking example is the overarching contrast between proem and finale, but there are many others. Similarly, the shifts in perspective just discussed are complementary rather than contradictory: early man was physically tough compared with modern man, but did not have the technological skills which would have enabled him to survive a modern climate. But Virgil's reading of Lucretius, like that of certain modern critics, insists on finding (or creating) contradictions. By playing up and exaggerating Lucretius' shifts in perspective, and combining his rationalist stance with other ways of understanding the world, Virgil abolishes the certainty and clarity of the Lucretian universe. It should be noted, furthermore, that many of the apparent contradictions in the DRN contribute towards Lucretius' rhetorical strategy: the attractive images of the early books are gradually undermined or corrected as we progress through the poem and come nearer to an acceptance of the natural cycle of birth and death, growth and decay. Cf. Gale (1994) 204-5 and 211-15 for discussion of the similar 'discontinuity' in Lucretius' presentation of the sun and of Venus/Natura.

Eclipses: 5.751-70; volcanic eruptions: 6.639-702; the clash of weapons: cf. the demythologization of the thunderbolt-as- weapon discussed above, and Lucretius' frequent references to the terrifying sound of thunder (e.g. 6.129, 155, 218, 288); earthquakes: 6.535-607; mysterious voices (traditionally attributed to Faunus, e.g. Varro, LL 7.36, Cic. Div. 1.101, ND 2.6): 4.580-94; ghosts: 4.35-45 and 759-67 (the phrase simulacra modis pallentia miris is a direct quotation from DRN 1.123, though Lucretius himself may be quoting Ennius. See Skutsch (1955) 155); floods: cf. 1.280-94; comets: cf. 2.203-9 and 5.1191; stones dripping blood and lightning from a clear sky are both adynata in Lucretius (1.884 and 6.247-8).

Note also the comparison with the Delphic oracle in 1.736-9, which is repeated, with reference to the DRN itself, in 5 . 1 1 0-1 3 .

Cf. Putnam (1979) 132: 'Personification both distinguishes and equates man and his charges. Hierarchical distinction defends the actions of civilization. Equation arouses our sympathy for the resultant suffering.' Conte (1986) 168-72 also has some pertinent comments on the contrary effects of 'sympathy' and 'empathy'. 74. Cf. Thomas ad loc. 75 . It must be admitted that Io was the victim, rather than the subject, of both (Jupiter' s) passion and (Juno' s) jealousy. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that, in the subsequent discussion of amor, sexual attraction is seen very much as something inflicted on both man and beast, as the gadfly is inflicted on Io: Venus with her caeci stimuli amoris (210) also victimizes animals and man, and breaks down the boundaries between them. Note too that both the gadfly and amor are associated with heat (cf. especially the parentheses in 154 and 272). Similar symbolism may be operating in the description of Turnus' shield {Aen. 7.37 1 ), which bears a picture of Io. Commentators generally explain this as a reference to Turnus' Argive ancestry, but it may also refer to his psychological condition and his 'transformation' by Juno's agent Allecto. Tumus is</page><page sequence="24">MYTH AND ALLUSION IN THE GEORGICS 59 maddened by the fury as Io is by the gadfly, and transformed into an animal: as Pöschl ((1962) 98-9) notes, he is very often compared to an animal in the later books. Cf. Hardie (1986) 1 18-19 and (1992); and Reckford (1961), who discusses other metamorphosis myths in book 7. It also seems appropriate that the individu- alistic Turnus' shield should refer to his own character and situation, while pius Aeneas' refers to his destiny and the destiny of his descendants. 76. Note also that the gadfly is referred to as pestis (153) and monstrum (152). Both terms are used by Lucretius in anti-mythological contexts: the hydra is Lernaea pestis in 5.26, and the fauns and satyrs of 4.580-94 are monstra ac portento. 77. The myth is somewhat obscure: different versions are recorded by Servius and Probus. See Mynors ad loc. for details. 78. Contrast especially DRN 5.890-900, where Lucretius argues against the existence of centaurs and scyllas, on the grounds that each species has its own distinct characteristics - including diet - which could not be combined in a single body. The horse again behaves unnaturally as a result of the plague, this time tearing itself to pieces with its own teeth (3.512-14): this action, like the effects of amor , is attributed to furiae (cf. 511 and 244, 266). The potentially monstrous behaviour of horses is perhaps hinted at already in 3.85, where the ideal horse uoluit sub naribus ignem , echoing DRN 5.30, Diomedis equi spirantes naribus ignem. Again, Virgil hints that the monsters dismissed by Lucretius are in some sense real (and dangerous): the horse's fiery nature, cultivated by the farmer, is ready at any moment to break out into violence. (For reversal of the description of the healthy horse in 498-514, see Thomas ad loc.) 79. Thuc. 2.47.4, Lucr. 6.1179, Geo. 3.550. 80. See Apollod. 1.9.12, Vitruv. 8.3.21. 81. Note especially timore (1 179). Lucretius lays greater emphasis on mental than physical suffering in his account of the plague: it is this kind of suffering which Epicurean philosophy can cure, as the poet claims in the proem to book 6. 82. Indeed, it is unclear which species Scylla and Nisus are supposed to represent: see Mynors ad loc. Frentz (1969) 97 notes that Lucretius refers to the swallow by the normal Latin name hirundo (3.6). 83. rudis (211) hints at personification - cf. Mynors ad loc. 84. furentis, 455. 85 . Cf. Farrell ( 1 99 1 ) 202-4, who links the references to the Lapiths in 3 . 1 1 3-1 7 and Chiron and Melampus in 3.549-50 with the rise and fall of civilization, specifically the rise and fall of Athens in DRN 6.1-6 and the plague. He also notes (p. 203, n. 59) a contrast between the bestial centaurs in 2.455-7 and the 'civilized' Lapiths in book 3, and suggests that this is why Lapiths, rather than the more usual centaurs, are credited with the invention of riding. It is significant though, that Bacchus , not the Lapiths, is said to have 'subdued' the centaurs. This is no victory of civilization over brutality, but of the god's double-edged gift, which first makes the centaurs mad, and then destroys them. Like Jupiter in book 1, Bacchus is not unambigously benevolent. (This is particularly troubling in view of Bacchus' association with poetic inspiration, both in the Georgics (see esp. 2.7-8 and 380-96, with Thomas ad loc.) and, implicitly, Lucretius (in the Dionysiac imagery of 1 .922-5). Poetry is again associated with wild, uncontrolled frenzy in 3.284-94, where the poet's amor drags him over mountain heights, like the mares maddened by sexual passion in 269-70. Again, there are echoes of Lucretius: cf. esp. 291-3 and DRN 1.926-7.) 86. See e.g. [Horn.] Batr. 7, Aesch. PV 353, Hor. Carm. 3.4.73, Isid. Etym. 11.3.13, and cf. Thomas ad 184-5 and 278-9. 87. Cf. Klingner (1967) 211.</page><page sequence="25">60 MONICA GALE 88. Cf. DRN 5.120: caeli restinguere solem. Lucretius scornfully denies that the Epicurean 'giants' are committing any impiety by 'destroying' the sun (i.e. declaring it to be perishable and non-divine). Virgil again reverses Lucretius' unconventional use of the myth: in Geo. 1, the giants are once again represented as a threat to order and civilization. 89. Cf. Frentz (1967) 72-107. Amongst the more convincing examples identified by Frentz (in addition to those discussed here) are the raven ( 1 .388), halcyon ( 1 .399; cf. 3.338, with Mynors ad loc.), hyacinth (4. 1 37) and catasterisms in 1.222, 246 and 4.232-5. The raven is particularly significant because (as mentioned above) it is used as an adynaton by Lucretius. Virgil vividly describes the corni: c improba stalking alone on the shore, calling for rain (1.388-9). Why improbal Presumably the epithet is chosen in part to reinforce the idea that the raven is actually summoning the unwelcome rain, rather than benevolently giving warning; but it seems also to recall the myth in which the bird is punished for talking too much. There may, in fact, be a specific reference to Callimachus, who describes the crow as kaíÒQq in lamb. 4 (fr. 194.82; cf. garrula , Ov. Met. 2.547), and in the Hecale (fr. 260) has the bird both describe its own punishment by Athene and prophesy the similar fate of the raven, which will be changed from white to black by Apollo. (The argument for seeing a Callimachean allusion here may be strengthened by the fact that Virgil is apparently conflating Aratus and Callimachus in the following lines, 390-2: cf. Hec. fr. 269, and see Thomas ad loc.) Virgil may have had either or both elements of the story in mind: his comix is apparently a raven, but both crows and ravens were regarded as weather-prophets, and the two species were often not fully distinguished (cf. Mynors ad loc.). Both parts of the story are dismissed by Lucretius: white ravens are an adynaton in 2.817-25, and the crow's avoidance of the Acropolis is explained 'scientifically' in 6.749-55 (with an allusion to the Callimachean account: cf. 753 and Hec. fr. 260-41). There are also echoes of Lucretius in the preceding lines: 383-5 recalls DRN 5. 1078-82, where Lucretius is discussing bird cries. (Note especially the Lucretian formula uariae uolucres in 383. Virgil also refers back through Lucretius to his Homeric model, II. 2.459-63; cf. Mynors ad loc.) The idea that the raven is actually calling the rain is also Lucretian (DRN 5.1086; in the other examples cited by Mynors ad loc., the crow/raven prophesies rain rather than summoning it), and the phrase uoce uocare is used of the cock 'summoning' the dawn in DRN 4.1 Ì 1. The heavy alliteration in 389 also gives the line a Lucretian ring. Virgil thus brings together two quite separate passages of the DRN, in one of which (2.817-25) Lucretius implicitly rejects the metamorphosis myth by treating the white raven as an adynaton, while in the other he describes the bird' s behaviour without reference to the myth (5 . 1 084-6). Virgil's comix, like Scylla and Nisus, persists in the 'wicked' behaviour which was the cause of its meta- morphosis. But the picture is further complicated by the statement a few lines later (415-23) that the birds' behaviour is not divinely inspired, but is the result of changes in air pressure. The language is again very Lucretian, particularly the catch- word diuinitus (415), which occurs eight times in the DRN and only here in Virgil. BIBLIOGRAPHY H. Altevogt, Labor improbus.
