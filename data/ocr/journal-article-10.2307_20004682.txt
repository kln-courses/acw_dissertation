<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 419 A. J. D. Porteous, R. D. Maclennan and G. E. Davie (eds.). The Credibility of Divine Existence. Collected Papers of Norman Kemp Smith. Pp. viii + 446. (London. Macmillan and Co., I967.) 50s. Professor Kemp Smith was a wise man, one of a great generation in British philosophy, and the editors have done a service in making his collected papers available. These are mainly on the theory of knowledge, but also some are on ethics, in the sense of reflections on human life and conduct in its widest setting, rather than in the sense of the technical discussions of moral philosophers. The papers span some fifty years, and show a remarkable unity of outlook. Kemp Smith was the kind of philosopher who forms his main convictions at an early age, and he went on developing them steadily through a long life. He called himself an 'idealist', by which he meant that he believed that the ultimate creative factor in the world was spiritual and a source of values; inside this metaphysical outlook he held a realist theory of knowledge, and was a strong opponent not only of 'naive realism' (which he thought no one could hold seriously-he would probably have said the same about naive realism in its recent linguistic form), but also of any kind of subjectivism. His criticism of Avenarius' combination of materialism and subjective idealism attracted honourable mention from Lenin in Materialism and Empirio-Criticism; Lenin agreed with him that this mixture would not do. Kemp Smith was convinced that we had direct face to face knowledge of external realities, but of each as contrasted and compared with other items in our experience. Seeing is thus always 'seeing as'; hence experience is not to be analysed into data which are pure particulars. Universals are the types into which we distinguish and classify. As Dr Maclennan says in his Introduction, it is a pity that Kemp Smith's subtle view of universals was developed by criticism of idealist views of the 'concrete universal' which are now of little interest. Those who may be put off by this somewhat dated context from reading the three articles on 'The Nature of Universals' may be advised to start with the masterly paper on 'The Fruitfulness of the Abstract'. Kemp Smith's 'realism' included the suggestion that sense perception gives us 'telepathic' information about things at a distance. Presumably he did not mean what is nowadays called the a factor, but was claiming that the physiological effects of external things (our consciousness, he reminds us, is embodied consciousness) produce conditions in which we are not, as Russell thought, aware of the end product in our own heads, but are put into a state in which we are selectively aware of certain characters of external objects 'out there', which characters, he thought, included their being really coloured, and emitting real sounds and not only sound waves. The first two papers give Kemp Smith's early work on Hume; it is clear that as early as 1905 he had seen that T. H. Green's Hume was a man of</page><page sequence="2">420 REVIEWS straw and was forming the interpretation of Hume's epistemology as a theory of belief which he was to develop long after in his book on The Philosophy of David Hume. Indeed Kemp Smith's work shows how he con tinually returned at different periods of his life to the great philosophers, notably Descartes, Hume and Kant, and re-assessed his interpretations, while also working out his own theory of knowledge in continuing reflection on them. The editors have called the book by the first version of the title which Kemp Smith gave to his well-known British Academy Lecture (I93I) 'Is Divine Existence Credible?' This lecture contains a vigorous attack, on Humean and Kantian lines, on the 'Argument to Design', and then looks at the question why, in spite of sceptical attacks, Hume and Kant as well as many others can never quite let the argument go. He suggests this is because, behind theistic arguments, there is a direct awareness of 'divinity', coming to us particularly in the experience of creativity in ourselves and in nature. This he says is a 'theomorphic' and not an 'anthropomorphic' concept, such as he thought Purpose and Design to be. It is an instance of the kind of concept he called 'problematic' (the Self wras another such); these are concepts which are 'mysterious', not in the sense of being completely opaque to reason, but as ones into which we can see a certain way, yet which hold further depths beyond what we can see (which does not mean that there is a barrier in principle beyond which we shall never be able to see any further). Kemp Smith had great influence as a teacher, and was an exceptionally generous and shrewd critic of the work of any younger philosophers who came his way. I myself received much kindness from him in these respects. I hope that this volume of essays will convey some impression of a great man to those who did not know him; it will surely be a welcome memorial of him to those who did.
