<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROGER TARR Brunelleschi and Donatello: Placement and Meaning in Sculpture In memory of my parents. When Donatello was born around 1386, Brunelleschi was about ten years old. The relationship which developed be- tween them in the first two decades of the fifteenth century is fairly well attested. First of all, there is the aetiologizing testi- mony of Manetti in his description of Brunelleschi's life, which explains both men's interests in the remains of antiquity through a trip to Rome, when, like "treasure hunters" as Manetti says they were called, they excavated the ancient city in search of sculptures and buildings of the Roman past.1 Second, there is the anecdotal evidence of their acquaintance as witnessed in their mutual involvement in the unkind joke of the fat woodworker, recorded by Manetti,2 and in their rivalry, described by Vasari, in a story adapted from Pliny, of two crucifixes when Brunelleschi criticized Donatello's as being more like the figure of a peasant on the cross than that of the Son of Man.3 Third, there is the factual documentation of their collaboration on the aborted project for a gigantic fig- ure for one of the buttresses of Florence Cathedral, commis- sioned in 1415 and for which some kind of model encased in gilded lead was made.4 Fourth, there is the less secure record of their further collaboration on the statues of St. Peter and St. Mark for Or San Michele, found in the Libro di Antonio Billi, in the Anonimo Magliabecchiano and in Vasari.5 In spite of this somewhat loose and circumstantial evi- dence, its variety and persistence does encourage us to ask how far such a relationship might be reflected in the sculp- tural work each produced, and also how far it might be pos- sible to discern the effect one had on the other in their atti- tude to the production and purpose of sculpture. This question was posed as far back as 1864 by Crowe and Cavalcaselle when they wrote: The powerful and stern figures of Sts. Peter and Mark at Orsanmichele, of theZuccone or Baldpate and other Evan- gelists on the outside of the Campanile of Santa Maria del Fiore at Florence, are all examples of the qualities that were combined in Donatello. It is true that the statues of Campanile are not so cleverly adapted as they might be to the space which they were intended to fill. But the master was not often at fault in this respect; and Vasari gives a telling account of the manner in which, being en- trusted with the execution of St. Mark of Orsanmichele 101</page><page sequence="2">ROGER TARR 1) &lt;(Silver Altar of St. James) (L. side), H. 315 cm, Duomo, Pistoia. and having finished it in the form best suited to the posi- tion it was to occupy, he discontented the syndics of the Linaiuoli by showing them the statue on the ground, and, a few days after roused their admiration to the highest pitch, by discovering it unaltered in its niche. Whether Donatello owed this scientific application of the law of optics to statuary, to Brunelleschi, or to his own study of the antique, it was an eminent quality in him, and the art of treating form so as to appear natural when seen at cer- tain distances and heights, has seldom been better ap- plied than it is in the St. Mark of Orsanmichele.6 It seems to me that Crowe and Cavalcaselle direct our atten- tion to a central aspect of Donatello's work, which is his abil- ity to instill in his figures an individual force of personality. And further to indicate that the naturalness of their appear- ance has to do with the relationship of their setting to the environment of the onlooker. How far this depended on Brunelleschi's example and guidance is the question that they ask, and is the one I should like to address in this article. I should also like to broaden the question to ask how far, with the story of the crucifixes in mind, Brunelleschi, by his ex- ample, encouraged Donatello to find appropriate ways of con- veying new spiritual meanings in his figures. Finally, I will suggest how this achievement seemed to place him, in the eyes of his contemporaries, on a par with the sculptors of antiquity. One of the most important moments in recent Donatello scholarship has been the discovery by Lucia Gai of a docu- ment of 1401, showing that Donatello was in Pistoia at the age of fifteen.7 The document is of interest for the informa- tion it gives of Donatello's personality, but it is also of impor- tance with regard to his early contact with the work of Brunelleschi. Brunelleschi was in Pistoia in 1399 and 1400 as an apprentice working on the great silver altar of St. James in the Cathedral there, for which he produced several quite re- markable figures, which seem to display a new approach to expressive naturalism in sculpture.8 It seems hardly likely that Donatello would not have seen these figures and so compared their impact to the prevailing late fourteenth century manner developed by Ghiberti in whose studio he was later to enrol.9 What were these figures, and what effect might they have had on the young Donatello? According to the re-construc- tion made in 1953, the four figures made by Brunelleschi were placed on the left-hand side of the altar [Fig. 1]. Two are half-length busts of prophets which are mentioned in the documents [Fig. 2]. There is a standing figure with head turned upwards [Fig. 3] and a fourth figure who is seated, pen in hand, with an open book on his lap [Fig. 4].

One prophet seems to convey his message to the on- looker with vehemence and conviction, the other turns his head upward [Fig. 5]. The standing figure is also in action, turning to look upwards in a spontaneous movement which conveys the sense of a moment of inspiration, perhaps origi- nally signified by the presence of a dove which is now lost. As with the prophets, the onlooker is engaged with an inner life through the outward gesture of the figure. The topmost figure is perhaps the most interesting in our context for, as with the prophets, when observed from in front it is distorted, but when seen from below it displays a convincing and life- like naturalism which engages the attention [Fig. 6]. The available photograph is not taken from a low enough angle, but it serves to give the basic idea [Fig. 7].11 In fact, accord- ing to Gai's establishment of the altar's original site in a chapel adjacent to the nave of the Cathedral, the figure would never have been seen at its own level. Indeed, the proximity of the side of the altar to the wall would have meant that the figure would have been seen from a steep angle which is that which gives the most convincing view.12 Seen from the side, the figure is elongated and leans for- ward [Fig. 8]. It is not entirely in the round but rather in a kind of high relief which gave Brunelleschi the opportunity to work out the correct distortion more easily than in a fully-rounded 103</page><page sequence="4">ROGER TARR 4) Brunelleschi, (Seated figure,.

The technique he used to effect this is hard to recon- struct; there are several possible methods. He may have used a mirror to fix a single viewpoint from which the resolution of the distortion would work. He may well have understood the principles of reflection in a mirror for this was a subject famil- iar from medieval optical treatises known at the time and from the principles of surveying for the establishment of distance 104</page><page sequence="5">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE U,,)__ __ .; s = _ _ ~~~~ ~~ ~ ~~~~~~~~vwa i7* \ .^n A . g, . .......................................... . -~ ~ ~ h ;- 3. .i;. .

Another possibility is that he observed how a shadow cast by the light from a candle placed below the figure would describe an elongated outline.15 If the candle were placed in the position of the eye of the intended observer, this would have provided him with a means of find- ing the relationship between the actual form and that per- ceived. As with a mirror, as long as he understood the prin- ciple, he could have drawn the rays of light, as it were, to find 7) Brunelleschi, Seated figure reconstructed as seen from below. Drawing by the author. the outline, rather than drawing round a shadow actually cast. Yet another possibility is that he used a ground plan and el- evation to establish a perspectival view as though the figure, like any three-dimensional object in space, were painted on a flat surface.16 Whatsoever method Brunelleschi may have used, the writer of the Uomini Singholari of around 1480 is quite ex- plicit about this aspect of Brunelleschi's achievement when he says: He was a marvellous sculptor. He found or rediscovered how to realize with precisely measured foreshortenings 106</page><page sequence="7">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE . , f - . i r . * ' ^ J t .L . t i \ ; -.

Drawing by the author. the different planes that the painters show receding in three dimensional space, and this greatly helped the paint- ers to render things so that they appear true to life, and to sculptors he gave the same system of receding planes, a system not used by the ancients.17 The dynamic spacial presence of the figure, thus achieved, establishes a continuity between the onlooker and the figure which focuses attention on the way its attitude reveals a state of mind. In its original position, the seated figure seems to be looking up from his book to the body of the church, which as a symbol of Christ's presence on earth provides him with in- spiration. The onlooker, then, is able to identify the type and character of the man, here one would suppose an Evangelist, and engage in his train of thought. The book and pen be- come guides to his active personality rather than merely pas- sive attributes. It is possible to see in these early works of Brunelleschi seminal demonstrations of those aspects of imaginative natu- ralism which both he and Donatello developed more fully in their later monumental sculpture. For in them Brunelleschi shows how the onlooker's situation might be taken into ac- count to direct attention to the spiritual meaning the figures convey. We are shown how variously divine inspiration re- veals and transmits itself through outward action. It is seen in the vehement spoken rhetoric of the half length prophet, in the flash of momentary enlightment in the standing fig- ure, and in the quiet contemplation of the seated man of letters. The onlooker is made to find within himself an echo of their different inner voices. In order to achieve this conti- nuity of response the sculptor must predetermine an image of the spiritual character of whomsoever is to be represented in his mind and then decide the form by which it might be best actively expressed. In other words, he should not rely on an established formula, but in each new instance reas- sess the expressive potential of character, placement and gesture. Brunelleschi's success depends on the onlooker's un- questioning suspension of disbelief in order to enter into the imaginative argument of the figures. As suggested above, he may have used either an empirical or a geometrical means to achieve this, but he may also have been aware of earlier practice, for it can be shown that the steeply turning head of the standing figure recalls similar poses in Mosan metalwork figures, and the use of distortion in sculpture intended to be seen from below had a tradition going back to antiquity.18 A relevant case of an earlier use of such a method by an Italian sculptor is that of the Madonna and Child which Arnolfo di Cambio made around 1300 for the lunette over the central 107 "1 r, **? i? ?It I ' L ? ? ? I*--- r r i? '. " I</page><page sequence="8">ROGER TARR 9) Arnolfo di Cambio, ((Madonna and Child)). Marble, H. 174 cm, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence. door of Florence Cathedral [Fig. 9].19 This group was in place until the sixteenth century and, as we have Manetti's word that Brunelleschi held Arnolfo in some esteem, it would be likely that he paid this group some attention.20 He may well have noticed, for example, how much more spacially con- vincing this group was than the Madonna della Rosa done for Or San Michele just before his departure for Pistoia [Fig. 10].21 Indeed, Arnolfo's work shows many of the same con- cessions to optical compensation as Brunelleschi's seated figure at Pistoia. The figure of the Madonna is not fully in the round, the head is somewhat enlarged, and seen from in front the torso is elongated, while the legs to the knees are shortened [Fig. 11]. In its elevated position these discrepan- cies are resolved into a group of convincing monumentality. However, the impression remains somewhat equivocal for, unlike with Brunelleschi's figures, the viewer is not persuaded that there is a single point of view from which the sculptor's imaginative idea can be experienced with the greatest im- pact. It is this precision of impact which Brunelleschi added to the older, more imprecise, method, and Donatello's under- standing of his innovation can be seen in one of his first major independent works in Florence, that of the seated figure of St. John the Evangelist. Interestingly enough, this was designed to be placed adjacent to the main doorway of the Cathedral where Arnolfo's group then stood [Fig. 12].22 The figure is strikingly close in design to the seated Evangelist of the Pistoia altar, for it displays not only the distortions of proportion and the limited depth seen in Arnolfo's and Brunelleschi's figures [Fig. 13], but also that sense of active contemplation which distinguishes the latter. Charles Seymour Jr. seems to have been the first to demonstrate its impact when seen from below as the viewer stood outside the main door of the Cathedral [Fig. 14].23 As with Brunelleschi's figure there is one point of view which the onlooker must discover, or light upon by chance, where the spiritual and formal aspects of the sculp- ture come together unequivocally to give a sense of the domi- nating presence of a man of vision. This general impression, however, is given a more specific focus, for as the viewer ac- cepts the existence of the figure within his own experience of time and space, he is moved to attempt to find "a local habita- tion and a name," as it were, for the Evangelist's transcen- dent vision. To catch a glimpse of the Evangelist's inspiration in the world about him. So, as one might follow another's gaze towards some distant object to share an experience, the viewer is moved to follow that of the Evangelist to light on the Baptistery which stands opposite the Cathedral facade [Fig. 15]. It is important to transpose the figure in the mind's eye to its original position, for in turning toward the Baptistery 108</page><page sequence="9">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE I 10) Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti?

Pen on paper, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence. through the eyes of St. John we are forced to see anew the mystery of the Word of God made man revealed by the Bap- tist as expressed in the great opening verses of the Fourth Gospel. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe.24 It is as though an inner light emanates from the Evangelist to illuminate for a moment the darkness of the passing world to concentrate our attention on the promise of redemnption through baptism. The effectiveness of such an image depends on the sculptor's ability to make the experience seem real, as though it took place in the natural course of things, so that it might become lodged in the memory so as to delight and instruct the mind both as it happens and in recall. In- deed, as Brunelleschi must have done with his figures, Donatello must have taken thought beforehand how to reveal the constant image of St. John, caught in a particu- lar attitude, which would best transmit the quintessential message of his gospel. To demonstrate that Donatello may well have gained the idea for this balance of ethos and pathos25 in the human figure from Brunelleschi, we should consider Vasari's story of the two crucifixes. According to Vasari's account, Brunelleschi's criticism was this: That Donatello appeared to him to have placed a peasant on the cross, and not a figure resembling that of Jesus Christ, whose person was delicately beautiful, and in all parts the most perfect form of man that had ever been born.26 110</page><page sequence="11">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE 13) Donatello, ((St. John the Evangelist)) (front and side views).

If the the two figures are compared, it is not difficult to see that Brunelleschi made his point, for Donatello's figure with its exaggerated musculature does have a certain roughness about it [Fig. 16]. Brunelleschi's, on the other hand, is more delicate and refined [Fig. 17].27 However, it seems to me that Brunelleschi's figure has the more mov- ing emotional impact and I shall try to explain why. Whereas Donatello's figure in Santa Croce hangs on the cross as any other figure, it has been remarked to me that Brunelleschi's figure in Santa Maria Novella seems to impress the onlooker in two different ways.28 From a distance it seems a perfect figure of Christ crucified, while on approaching and looking up from below, a sense of the frailty of His suffering seems to bring that perfect image within the realms of human experi- ence. It is as though the ethos of the figure, its abiding qual- ity-its perfection, is seen through the pathos of its temporal condition-its frailty. It seems to me that this equivocation of the human and the divine expresses with utmost clarity the idea of God made man. The argument can be taken a little further for in the conception of the figure two systems of pro- portion are used, one ideal the other empirical. They both reflect the anthropomorphic basis which Vitruvius set down for the proportion of temples. Vitruvius identifies two differ- ent systems which should correspond in the ideal temple. The first is that: Proportion consists in taking a fixed module, in each case, both for the parts of a building and for the whole, by which the method of symmetry is put into practice.29 The second describes the way a circle and a square can be drawn from a man placed on his back with his hands and feet extended. These two methods of proportion de- rive from different points of view. In the case of that based on a certain measure as standard, it is the deduction of perfection from the experience of the imperfections of the material world. In the case of that based on the perfect forms of a circle and a square, it is the imposition of an abstract ideal on the imperfect form of man. In other words in both cases there is a balance between the conceptual and the experiential. In Brunelleschi's figure of Christ these two are brought together. For it has been shown that the basic three-dimensional measurements of the figure re- late to the length of the arm as a standard measure,30 and it has also been shown that the overall two-dimensional proportions can be circumscribed by a circle whose cen- tre is the navel.31 Whereas the former takes account of the mutable dimension of substance by using the arm's length or braccio (a unit of measurement familiar in con- temporary Florence) to establish the figure's pathos in a world of change, the latter seeks to establish an eternal, changeless, measure, the abiding ethos of the figure, which takes no account of the solidity of the material world. Christ therefore bears in His body in equal parts the all too fragile imperfection of mankind along with the unassail- able perfection of the divine. The viewer would bring to bear these two aspects of the form of the figure either con- sciously or unconsciously on his identification of the fig- ure and on his understanding of its meaning. In the case of Christ crucified there is no problem with the identifica- tion. However, if we return to Donatello's St. John the Evange- list, the issue is more crucial, for, strictly speaking, when ap- proaching the four seated figures on the Cathedral facade from afar, it would not have been immediately clear from attribute, gesture, or, indeed, physiognomy, which Evangelist was which. It is only on closer acquaintance, and by its presence, as I have described above, that the viewer identifies Donatello's figure as St. John. This sense of an inner life of revelation moving behind external forms seems to me to be the most profound lesson Brunelleschi's sculpture teaches, and it is in keeping with those aspects of his intellectual character which can be deduced from the scant written evidence that has come down to us. The clearest statement of this aspect of him, is made by Anto- nio Billi, when he says: Pippo [Brunelleschi] was learned in Holy Writ, and Mae- stro Paulo [Toscanelli], astrologer, used to say that when one listened to him speaking he seemed a veritable St. Paul. He was an arithmetician and geometrician and he rediscovered perspective which had been lost for many years. He was interested in the interpretation of the works of Dante and understood them very well indeed.32 Brunelleschi may well have met Toscanelli when Toscanelli was in Florence in 1424. There is one piece of literary evi- dence by Brunelleschi himself, written probably around 1425, which contains, as Parronchi has sensitively pointed out, a covert reference to a passage in St. Paul.33 This helps to give credence to Billi's statement. The reference occurs in a son- net Brunelleschi wrote in reply to the disparaging verses of Giovanni di Gherardo da Prato, who had accused him of "try- ing to present as a truth that which is uncertain"; that is with- out facts at hand as proof.34 Brunelleschi countered by say- 116</page><page sequence="17">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE ing that through inspiration (speranza) from above, man, freed from the limitations of the corruptible world, acquires the high- est power of judgement, not the false judgement which can be overcome by experience. The veiled echo from St. Paul follows this. "For the wise man." Brunelleschi says, "nothing is invisible except that which does not exist." St. Paul's words are: For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.35 Brunelleschi goes on to say that the fantasies of those not schooled in practical experience, which for Brunelleschi would have included geometry, do not see what art can do when it steals from nature. The sonnet concludes with the riposte that what to Giovanni da Prato seemed impossible, Brunelleschi is bringing into being. The meaning of the poem revolves round the antithesis of two distinct concepts, that of "speranza" or inspiration given from above (da/l alto), and that of "fantasie" or fantasies that, without the grounding in actual experience, which anchors the former, fail to penetrate the deep meaning of reality. As a scholar of Dante, Brunelleschi would have known the ambivalence of the concept of fantasia in the long tradition of classical and medieval thought. It could signify either vain imagining, or a more substantial and active faculty in man's intellectual recreation of his sensible existence, which leads, as in Dante's case, to a higher plane of understanding where the shadowy substance of the senses gives way to clearer unobstructed vision. Dante's phrase "I'alta fantasia" echoes in the first line, and the overall drift of the sonnet, as Parronchi has suggested, recalls the enigmatic lines of St. Paul which so haunted the medieval imagination: "For now we see as through a glass darkly, then face to face."36 Perhaps as early as 1413 in his panel of the Baptistery Brunelleschi had demonstrated his understanding of the ob- jective world, and shown how far the intellect can solve the illusion of actuality by recreating basic tenets of optical per- ception.37 By using a mirror in his experiment he created a metaphor for our experience for we see both within and through a glass. As described by Manetti, the illusion was that, while standing and viewing the painting in the position from which Brunelleschi had constructed the view, we see reflected in a mirror the same view as we see in fact when the mirror is removed. The mirror acts, as it were, as the equiva- lent of the eye itself, which exist as a veil between the inner world of the imagination, formed by memory and recall, and the fluctuating world of incidentals which fuel its activity. In the case of the painting of the Baptistery we see simultaneously the outward form of the building, its accidental form, and the interior rational structure, its substance, which gives it its par- ticular appearance. We seem to see through the object so the image penetrates the eye to stimulate the active intelligence of the mind. It seems to me that the same holds true for our understanding of figurative sculpture; that we see first the superficial features and then discern the fundamental struc- ture.38 In terms of expressive meaning, we respond first to the pathos then to the ethos of any figure. I have already suggested that this is the sequence of re- sponse which guides our reaction both to Brunelleschi's Cru- cifix and to Donatello's St. John. The St. John, interestingly enough, seems to have been under way mainly in 1412 and 1413, the time when Brunelleschi may have been making his demonstration. Perhaps in the Evangelist's concentrated gaze we can see an equivalent to that of Brunelleschi himself set in the central doorway of the Cathedral to paint the Baptistery. Concurrently with the St. John, Donatello was working on a large, white figure of Joshua, called in the documents the "homo magnus et albus," made in terracotta coated with gesso, which was to be placed on one of the buttresses or sprone of the tribune of the Cathedral.39 The documents show that this figure was complete by 1410 and set up by 1412 and that it was probably commissioned around 1409.40 Two ear- lier smaller figures for this setting had been made by Donatello and Nanni di Banco in response of a commission from the Operai in 1408.41 However, they seem to have proved unsat- isfactory; we know that one must have been erected, as a document records it being put back on the ground a year later. The three figures which have been associated with this com- mission, the Isaiah, the marble David and the unidentified Prophet standing on a pentagonal base, would all have been rather small for such a distant and elevated site.42 It is also the case that none of them shows any attempt to offset the sharp angle from which it would have been seen by the use of adjustments to its proportions. The new figure of Joshua, which may have been up to nine braccia (roughly 16ft.) high, was much larger than those earlier figures, but apparently still did not satisfy the commissioners, for a document of 1415 records a part-payment to Donatello and Brunelleschi for "a little figure of stone clad in lead gilt which had been made at the request of the Operai as a test and demonstration (pruova e mostra) for large figures which are to be made for placing on the buttresses of Santa Maria del Fiore."43 The implication is that this modello would solve the unresolved problems of site, scale and, possibly, weight. The sequence of events is instructive, for the document which is dated the 9th October shows that Donatello and 117</page><page sequence="18">ROGER TARR 19) Jacopo della Quercia, ((Apostle)), in situ on the north flank of San Martino, Lucca. 18) Jacopo della Quercia, (&lt;Apostle)).

Brunelleschi were asking for payment for this demonstration figure the day after Donatello's St. John the Evangelist had been placed in its niche on the Cathedral facade.44 We know that Donatello had been given money to lock the chapel in which he was working on the St. John in January 1415, as perhaps he wished to keep the innovation of his design a se- cret.45 Once it had been set up and the commissioners could see the impact it made, he and Brunelleschi may well have felt greater confidence in pressing for payment for a model which showed similar optical compensation for its intended site, and which on the ground may have looked distorted. Jacopo della Quercia's standing figure for a similar posi- tion on one of the buttresses of Lucca Cathedral provides some support for the idea that the proportions of the Joshua were 118</page><page sequence="19">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE / j 20) Donatello, ((St. Mark)).

Jacopo's figure exhibits quite markedly a disproportion in the relation of legs to torso when seen on the ground, which resolves itself convincingly when it is seen in situ [Fig. 19]. Furthermore, the drapery of the upper half of the figure and the ponderation mirrors that of the St. Mark for Or San Michele, for which we know Donatello was given the commission in 1411, and which was substan- tially finished, though not completed, by 1413 [Fig. 20].47 The St. Mark shows carefully judged alterations to the proportion of lower to upper half just as does Jacopo's Apostle [Fig. 21]. 21) Donatello, (&lt;St. Mark) seen in situ from below. 119</page><page sequence="20">ROGER TARR - ~ ~ "rL7 .~ ~?ILhZL ~~~~~- ~YC~ 22) Paolo Schiavo, ((Madonna and Child with Saints)), s. and d. 1436, San Miniato al Monte, Florence. It seems to me that there is a cumulative weight of evi- dence that Donatello's sculptural activity between 1412 and 1415 saw the incorporation of the lessons of illusionary natu- ralism. There is no sign of such thinking in his work of the first decade of the century, done under the influence of Ghiberti's studio. It seems, therefore, that he was bringing into play, on a monumental scale, the impact Brunelleschi's figures in Pistoia had made on him in his early formative years. Donatello's collaboration with Brunelleschi on the aborted project for the large figure for the buttress of the Cathedral suggests that at this time their conception of sculpture was very close. It is, therefore, of particular interest that sources from the Uomini Singholari in the late fifteenth century to Billi and theAnonimo Magliabecchiano in the early sixteenth, say that the St. Mark was also a collaboration between them.48 Vasari echoes this view and it was probably from him that Crowe and Cavalcaselle took their lead. He comments first on this innovatory nature of Donatello's art when describing the Cantoria, of which he says: It may be said of this master, that he effected as much by his judgement (giudizio) as by his skill of hand, seeing that many works are produced which appear very beauti- ful in the work-rooms where they are executed, but which, when taken thence and placed in another situation, in a different light or higher position, present a much changed 120</page><page sequence="21">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE aspect, and turn out to be the reverse of what they ap- peared. Donato, on the contrary, treated his figures in such a manner, that while in the rooms where they were executed they did not produce one-half the effect, which he had in fact secured for them, and which they exhibited when placed in the positions for which they had been calculated.49 Part of the point here is Donatello's so called "non-finito," ex- panded upon in the Life of Luca Della Robbia; but the fact that Vasari emphasizes not only "different light" (altro lume), but also a "higher position" (piu alto) suggests he may have had in mind compensation of proportion for height as well. We are told, therefore, that some sculptors produce work which may look very fine indeed in the studio, but which fails when placed in its intended situation. Vasari makes this point explicitly in relation to the St. Mark for Or San Michele, where he says: This figure was executed by Donatello with so much judge- ment (giudizio) that when it was on the ground its excel- lence was not recognised by unskilled persons (chi non aveva giudizio), and the consuls of this art were not dis- posed to accept it; but Donatello asked them to show it set up, as after he had retouched it the figure would ap- pear quite different. This was done, the figure was veiled for fifteen days, and then, without having done anything to it he uncovered it, and filled everyone with admiration.50 The key term again is "giudizio." Those without judge- ment, who might respond to mere skill of hand, only realized Donatello's success once they saw the figure in its intended site. They lacked the judgement to anticipate that success on the ground. Apart from Jacopo della Quercia, a contemporary re- sponse to this innovation can be seen in the figure of St. Mark by Paolo Schiavo in his fresco of the Madonna and Child and Saints, dated 1436, in the nave of San Miniato al Monte [Fig. 22].51 Here the figure is clearly shown as being-seen from below, and the proportions, though slightly elongated overall to counteract the effect of a painted image seen from a low angle, correspond to those of Donatello's St. Mark when seen in situ. This figure, compared to the other Saints in the same painting, also has a relaxed and natural pose; the quality that would have most impressed the contemporary viewer of the St. Mark at Or san Michele when compared to, say, Nanni di Banco's figures for the same building. Michelangelo is said to have commented that "he had never seen anyone who had the bearing of an honest man to a greater degree than this figure, and if St. Mark resembled 23) Brunelleschi? ((St. Peter)). Marble, H. 237 cm, Or San Michele, Florence. this statue his words certainly inspired belief."52 The lion on the base of the tabernacle does identify him, but it is the fig- ure itself that best reveals the inner man who casts his eye with such authority and compassion over the passing world. In its bearing is shown the writer who, with unadorned clarity, presented the gospel of Jesus by concentrating on His minis- try among the people, His personality as revealed in His pub- lic words and deeds, culminating in the final revelation of His 121</page><page sequence="22">ROGER TARR .. k ..

It is as though, in the midst of the everyday world, we should seek to find, as did St. Mark, the meaning of Christ's mission. Since the later fifteenth century, as with the St. Mark, the statue of St. Peter on Or San Michele has also been ascribed to Donatello [Fig. 23].53 However, during the sixteenth cen- tury, the tradition grew that both sculptures were done in col- laboration with Brunelleschi.54 There is no documentation to bear this out, and in fact it is by no means univerally accepted that Donatello had any thing to do with the St. Peter. But it is still worth asking whether it is the only surviving example of their collaboration. It has many qualities remarked upon in the St. Mark which seem consistent with the pre-occupations both men were bringing at the time to monumental statuary. First of all it shows a concern with the placement of a figure in a niche above eye level, as the proportions of the figure are adjusted in a similar way to those of the St. Mark to read off for optical foreshortening. Second, account is taken of its relationship to its environment in such a way as to subtlely portray the character of the person represented. The figure stands on the corner of Or San Michele at the junction of the via Or San Michele and the via de'Calzaiuoli, and engages the attention of the passer-by by the way it gazes fixedly outward from its niche towards a distant point above and behind him, 122</page><page sequence="23">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE much in the same way that the St. John the Evangelist looks forth towards the Baptistery. As with the St. John, the on- looker is encouraged by the St. Peter's attitude to follow his gaze to seek what it is that engages his attention, for it seems to offer a clue to his train of thought. If we project his line of sight, it falls on the dome of the Cathedral [Fig. 24]. Of course, the height of the buildings nowadays precludes such a view, but from a late fifteenth century view of Florence it is possible to see how, during its erection, the dome would have been seen quite clearly rising above the low houses which at that time stood between Or San Michele and the Cathedral com- plex [Fig. 25]. St. Peter would have presided like a capomae- stro over the final completion of the church of Sta. Maria del Fiore. This was entirely appropriate to his status as the apostle on whose faith the edifice of Christianity was to be founded, as witnessed by St. Matthew: And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.55 St. Peter carries the keys of the Kingdom and a book- perhaps his Epistles-in which he uses the image of the priest- hood as a spiritual house whose stones are the living testi- mony of the faithful. Again, as with the St. John and the St. Mark, the figure's message is alive within the contemporary experience of the onlooker, and in the early fifteenth century it would have been so apposite as the great dome "vast enough to cover the entire Tuscan population with its shadow," as Alberti described it later on, rose over the embattled city.56 If it is not a collaboration, is it possible that the St. Peter is by Brunelleschi alone? Unfortunately, except for the wooden Crucifix in Santa Maria Novella, there are no surviving large scale sculptures by his hand, and except for the later sources linking him with the Or San Michele figures, no evidence that he worked in marble.57 However, there are several specific observations which may support the attribution. First, the figure stands well within its niche and the direction of its gaze is aligned with the upright of the tabernacle. This is how Brunelleschi used the embrasures of the central door of the Cathedral in the preparation of his perspective panel of the Baptistery; taking up a position within the door in order to limit the angle of vision while looking outward across space to a distant building. Second, the marbleintarsia panels deco- rating the niche, which show geometric perspectives from a 25) &lt;(View of Florence,,, c. 1480-90. Detail of the 19th C. painted panel reproducing the so-called "Chain Map" woodcut now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, Museo di Firenze com'era, Florence. low angle, give the viewer a clue as to the optical adjustment of the figure. This links it with Brunelleschi's preoccupation with perspectival representation at the time. Third, the head of the figure derives from that of the bronze figure of St. Peter in Rome probably by Arnolfo di Cambio, whose work, as sug- gested above, may have inspired Brunelleschi. Finally, the sharpness of the draperies, the precision of beard and facial features, and the veining on the hands, taken overall, seem to be more the work of a goldsmith, which Brunelleschi was, 123</page><page sequence="24">ROGER TARR iC?? b *r i" r c' * 't r *rF .r r' ?r I-. *I?t..

The face shows a firm sense of structure in the way the eyes are set in their sockets and the nose and cheek bones are comparable to the Pistoia figures and the Abraham of the competition relief. The figure does not have Donatello's sense of monumentality and maybe we see in it evidence of a limitation in Brunelleschi's genius, or perhaps it was actually carved by someone else, but it seems to me that it could not have been conceived without Brunelleschi's active participation.58 The actual date of the St. Peter is not known, but if it can be accepted that the attitude of the figure is reflected in Donatello's St. George, then it was presumably completed before 1417.59 The sense of an emotive spiritual presence, inhabiting the ev- eryday world and responding as though a being sentient to its demands, is also found in the figure of St. George which looks forth from its niche much like the St. Peter [Fig. 26]. It stands at the opposite end of the northern flank of Or San Michele, and, being in a more shallow niche, the profile of the figure and the direction of its gaze are even more emphatic. This emphasis underlines its physical presence and enhances its spontaneity. The impression is of someone one might encounter, and this sense of vitality was recognized in Donatello's lifetime by Filarete.60 It became a topos of art criticism in the sixteenth century culminating in Francesco Bocchi's written eulogy of 1571.61 The term used to describe the figure is "pronto" or "prompto" signifying "readiness" or "alertness." By Bocchi's time, the St. George had been made exemplary of the way substantial character might be expressed through "costume" and physiognomic expression. It was seen to present an es- sential image of Fortitude. Unlike the St. Peter, however, its gaze has no specific object, but is rather towards a protagonist of the mind, an imagined dragon of tyranny and oppression (the figure faces north towards Milan at a time of Visconti op- pression), or perhaps, more exactly, faithlessness. For the fig- ure shows, as do the St. Mark and the St. John the Evangelist, how Donatello took thought as to the deeper, more reflective, meaning of his statues. But here, without the gospels to pro- vide the character, he allows an idea to give substance to the figure. Its impact depends on the viewer seeing in the firm stance and in the ready attitude in defiance of a faithless and uncertain world, a believable image of the inner resolution of the Christian soul. From a distance, coming down the via Or San Michele, the Shield of Faith first catches the eye for it seems both to protect and support the figure. On approaching nearer, "the whole armour of God,"- the breastplate of righteousness, the sword of the spirit and the helmet of salvation-is revealed, for originally the figure wore a bronze helmet and carried in his hand a sword or spear.62 If Toscanelli heard an echo of St. Paul in Brunelleschi's words, in the figure of St. George we see the t,1 I i i I II 28) Donatello, &lt;(St. Louis of Toulouse)).

And Donatello allowed this to enhance its spiritual meaning. St. Louis, born in Provence in 1274, after captivity in Barcelona where he suf- fered ill treatment, professed his vows as a Franciscan in Rome. As a follower of the true poverty of St. Francis, he reluctantly acceded to the archbishopric of Toulouse, though he did not live to govern the diocese for he died at the early age of twenty three in 1297. Donatello has represented him as a young man overburdened by the accoutrements of office as though they weighed too heavily on the frail body and the fragile spirit that they clothe.65 The technique of the figure is also innovatory, for, as it was to be fire-gilded, it is made up of plates bolted together, so that, in fact, the statue is a hollow shell of metal [Fig. 29].66 Such a method of casting had been used before for small scale works, but not on anything so large. Brunelleschi's figures for Pistoia, for example, are hollow, yet give a sense of solid- ity and weight, and it is as though in the St. Louis of Toulouse Donatello gave monumental scale to Brunelleschi's earlier achievement rather as he did in marble in the St. John the Evangelist. Although Donatello's exact method of making the separate pieces is not known, it is likely that he had an under- lying figure on which he could shape and model the pieces to be cast. In principle this would not be dissimilar to encasing a stone figure in gilded metal as Donatello and Brunelleschi did for the tribune figure of 1415. The fact that it was made to demonstrate how a figure, presumably in metal, might be made to a size not possible in the usual manner suggests that at this time they were working together on a similar method of piece-meal casting to provide lightness as well as size. Perhaps in the St. Louis Donatello saw the opportunity to put this method into practice. According to the documents the St. Louis was nearing completion by May 1423, and was certainly in place by No- vember 1425.67 Presumably, Donatello had been working on the figure from around 1420. From as early as December 1415, at the same time as he was most likely working on the St. George, Donatello had also been at work on the first of five marble figures of Old Testament prophets for the Campanile. The documentation shows that all five figures were eventu- ally completed by January 1436.68 These figures are securely identified as the Beardless and Bearded Prophets, the Abraham and Isaac, the Jeremiah and the Habbakuk. They were probably made in that order. The figures were commis- sioned to complete the series of Old Testament prophets for the niches mid-way up the Campanile soon after it had reached nearly its present height under the direction of Giotto. The eight figures which already existed had been made around 1340, most probably by Andrea Pisano. Of these, four can be identified quite confidently: the two Sybils-female figures with their scrolls-and Solomon and David likewise with scrolls and with appropriate dress. The other four figures seem to be prophets, but, except for Moses carrying the somewhat cumbersome Tablets of the Law, it is not possible to identify them with conviction, as their scrolls are not inscribed and their physical characterization is not distinct [Fig. 30].69 The scheme most probably depends on the similar place- ment and choice of figures which were made in the late thir- teenth century for Siena Cathedral facade. However the drap- ery and attitudes of the figures, which reveal the representational tradition in which Andrea Pisano worked, does not approach the grandiloquence of Giovanni Pisano's figures, where the prophets and sages of antiquity, dressed in believable garments, vigorously display the texts they carry on their scrolls.70 Andrea has attempted to individualize the figures but without Giovanni's firm sense of character. Fur- 126</page><page sequence="27">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE 30) Andrea Pisano, ((Three prophets)). Marble, H. 178-184 cm, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence. thermore, Andrea made little attempt to compensate for the height of the figures when viewed from a fair distance below, which is such a striking characteristic of Giovanni's work. Donatello's figures on the other hand, seem to be in the true tradition of the Pisan master, for it is quite clear that their bodily proportions are adapted to suit the height at which they were to be seen. To take the comparison with Giovanni a little fur- ther; in Giovanni's figures, it is possible to see a development in the representation of rhetorical gesture, proper to the sub- ject, from the "early" Sybil to the later figure of Mary Moise. A similar developing confidence in the portrayal of expres- sion can be seen in Donatello's figures from the Beardless Prophet to the Habbakuk. The documents cannot be specifically related to any of the existing statues except for the Abraham and Isaac group whose identity is clear [Fig. 31]. The known documentation merely shows that one figure was done between 1415 and 1418, a second between 1418 and 1420, and that the Abraham was completed by 1421. A further figure was made from 1423 to 1425 and a last, named "Habbakuk" in the later stages, was made between 1427 and 1435.71 Stylistically the four uniden- tified figures fall into two pairs on either side of the Abraham and Isaac. With that group there seems to-be a major change of emphasis. The extraordinary intensity of Abraham's atti- tude can be read from a distance, and the way of conveying outwardly an inner vision seems to be developed to the full in 127 . fY</page><page sequence="28">ROGER TARR 31) Donatello and Nanni di Bartolo, ((Abraham and Isaac).

However, with the exception of the Beardless Prophet, Donatello, unlike Andrea and Giovanni, has not used attributes or scrolls to make their identity imme- diately recognizable.

It may be that when they were made con- temporary viewers would grasp spontaneously who was whom; which prophet, for example, was the contemplative one, which one the bold speaker, and so on, in spite of their lack of traditional identification, but for the modern viewer such a response cannot be guaranteed. Is it possible to give a name to each of the statues; is it important to do so if what Donatello intended the viewer to respond to is rather more than the intrinsic gravitas of the figures, their high seriousness? There are reasons to think that Donatello did have in mind the specific characterization of each one. In the Abraham and Isaac, for example, the meaning depends upon the choice of a specific moment within a narrative to convey the deep inner significance of outward movement and gesture. Just as Brunelleschi had chosen in his competition panel of 1401 the physical moment of the angel's intervention to present the crucial psychological im- pact of the story, so Donatello has stopped the action, as it were, at a point where Abraham relaxes the pressure of the knife on Isaac's throat in response to a force apparently be- yond himself. However, unlike in Brunelleschi's depiction, no angel restrains his hand, and what we see in the turn of the head over the shoulder and the eyes cast upward is the inspi- ration of a higher presence which seems to speak to Abraham's inner ear from beyond the bounds of the temporal world. It seems, as Alberti might have said, a "movimento dell'animo," made known by the immediate movement of the body, a movement of the Patriarch's own inner spiritual existence. The drama is contained within the body of Abraham, for, as we are told, the angel of the Lord called to Abraham out of heaven "and Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold be- hind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns."72 The coin- cidence of the two moments states with wonderful clarity the equivocation of inward and outward experience. It is the cast- ing up of the eyes which links them, and Donatello has cho- sen such a quintessential movement of inspiration to fix in the memory an abiding image of the Patriarch, to lead the viewer to contemplate within his own experience of time and space the profound meaning of Abraham's tribulation. The impression of immediacy, heightened by Donatello's ability to utilize viewpoint also informs our encounter with the other individual figures for the Campanile, although they do not have the benefit of a narrative to explain them. However, they each convey a distinct personality, so that we seem to see in the outward disposition of their parts the visual manifestation of a profound inner conviction. Their 130</page><page sequence="31">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE individuality is enhanced by the portrait-like character of the heads, a point already remarked upon as early as the sixteenth century and it brings to mind the earlier use of seeming portraits in the work of the northern European sculptor Claus Sluter. Although there is some scant evidence for the knowledge of northern sculpture in Florence in Donatello's day,73 his source of inspiration amongst earlier sculptors must surely have been Giovanni Pisano. We know that Donatello was working on a "Habbakuk" for the Operai between 1434 and 1436, after he had returned from Rome where he had been with Michelozzo.74 The "Zuccone," besides its baldness, is characterized by its open mouth as if the figure is in the act of speaking similar to one of Brunelleschi's prophets at Pistoia, and also similar to the figures by Giovanni in Siena, which Donatello may well have seen on his journey to or from Rome. A comparison between the "Zuccone" and Giovanni's Habbakuk [Fig. 36] makes the connection even clearer, as it is a figure whose noble features might well be seen as those of a younger "Zuccone," exaggerated in old age. In particular, the already receding hair, the short closely cropped beard, the long diagonal sweep of the drapery across the body and the right shoulder and arm pushed back against the turn of the head to the right, bears out this comparison. It is the first figure in which Donatello attempted to invest the power of speech which in the sixteenth century gave rise to the legend of him cursing the statue for its obdurate silence.75 As the impression of speech is a salient characteristic of Giovanni's figures, the dependence of the "Zuccone" on them is even more likely, and it would sort well with Donatello searching for the most appropriate way Habbakuk's vehement complaint to the Lord of the iniquity of the land, might best be given its most poignant expression. O Lord, how long shall I cry and wilt thou not hear! Even cry out unto violence, and wilt thou not save.76 If the "Zuccone" can therefore be identified as Habbakuk, then the inscription on the scroll of the other figure may well be correct, and it should be identified as Jeremiah. Indeed, the stern set of the mouth, the brooding reproachful eyes, the unkempt clothing and the defiant attitude of this figure give the impression of a solitary, intense personality, strung be- tween conviction and despair, not unlike the prophet who, on the one hand, served an uncompromising God, and, on the other, was plagued by self doubt and who, in his own words, would deny Jerusalem "the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness."77 Unfortunately, the "Zuccone" is the only figure which bears 36) Giovanni Pisano, ((Habbakuk),. Marble, H. 188 cm, Museo del Duomo, Siena. 131</page><page sequence="32">ROGER TARR direct comparison with its counterpart by Giovanni at Siena, but, as with the Jeremiah, it seems to me that the strong char- acterization of the other figures invites identification. The pen- sive attitude of the Bearded Prophet could pick him out as Zechariah, the introverted mystic, whose visions were inter- preted by the angel of the Lord to signify the political turmoil of the Persian empire. If that be so, I would be inclined to see the Beardless Prophet as Haggai, who, with Zechariah, initi- ated the rebuilding of the destroyed Temple of Jerusalem, and prophesied a day of divine retribution which would liberate the Jews, making them an independent nation, rather as Flo- rence at the time might be liberated from Visconti oppres- sion, when the new Temple would be greater than Solomon's was before. The figure's emphatic indication of his scroll un- derlines the prophetic inevitability of his words. Indeed, if the suggestion that the head of the figure is a portrait of Brunelleschi be correct, such an identification of the figure with Haggai in the context of the completion of the new Cathedral of Flo- rence would be particularily apposite.78 In Donatello's conception of the Campanile prophets both separately and as a group there is an echo of Brunelleschi's early figures at Pistoia which must have so much affected his youthful imagination. For in them he has explored in pose and attitude the different temperaments through which the insight of vision is revealed. One indicates emphatically his written testimony, another is wrapt in contemplation, another looks up from the scroll he is reading, another responds to a voice he hears, another is in the act of speaking. They are each activities which are real to the viewer's own sensory world, as though the faculties of man's understanding are the true channels through which the word of God makes itself known if only mankind would stop to see and hear. These prophets presiding over the changing life of the city are in themselves vehicles for the authority of true knowledge and their message is unequivocal. Within the overall meaning of the sculptural programme on the Campanile, they stand like Plato's philosopher-statesmen, whose access to the higher truths of divine revelation sets them apart from but related to the day to day world represented by the mechanical and liberal arts on the lower registers of the building. Their theological and ethical meaning in Republican Florence would have been all the more poignant for they seemed to inhabit a world as tangible to the senses as it was accessible to the soul.79 The sculptural programme of the Campanile, however, served a further purpose, for the Old Testament prophets acted as did the bell of the tower itself to, summon the faithful in preparation, as it were, for the demonstration of the New Dis- pensation of Christ, whose incarnation was shown in the lu- nettes of the main portals of the Cathedral facade, witnessed by the Evangelists, who sit as intermediaries, both physically and symbolically, between each man's earthly life and his sal- vation. Between the 1390's and 1408 a change of iconography was envisaged for the facade. The seated Evangelists replaced earlier standing figures of the Fathers of the Church [Fig. 37].80 Donatello's St. John the Evangelist, as I have suggested, af- fords a clue to this change of meaning by the way the on- looker is encouraged to refer across the space of the so-called "Paradiso" to the Baptistery and so to his first commitment to the Christian faith and the promise of redemption. What is interesting in this change of emphasis is that the new com- mitment is not so much to the authority of the Church, as interpreted by the Fathers, but to a more direct experience of Christ through the first witnesses to his life and teaching, who were baptised with the Holy Ghost. By being drawn to the true meaning of Christian baptism, the onlooker becomes conscious of the true penitence which had been the Baptist's own uncompromising demand. It is impossible to say, of course, whether or not Brunelleschi or Donatello were consulted on the overall meaning of such schemes as the iconography of the facade of the Cathedral or the Campanile. The most likely answer is that they were not, but were commissioned to produce individual figures within those arrangements. But what I have tried to show, particularly in Donatello's sculpture for major Florence sites, is the way in which he saw the imaginative potential of such commissions, to develop, under the early guidance of Brunelleschi, a sense of immediacy and relevance in the contemporary viewer. It seems that Crowe and Cavalcaselle were right to see Brunelleschi's hand in the prerequisite of optical compensation as part of this achievement. But, I believe the influence went far deeper and provided Donatello with a basic grounding for the way each individual figure or group of figures should relate to the viewer's own experience and chal- lenge the deeper springs of his understanding. Leonardo Bruni, writing in 1425, when the full impact of Donatello's sculpture could be seen in Florence, for the St. Mark, the St. George, the St. Louis of Toulouse, the St. John the Evangelist, and probably three of the Campanile figures were in situ, and Brunelleschi's statues of St. Peter, theMagdalen81 and most likely the wooden Crucifix in Santa Maria Novella were in place, makes the point succinctly when he says the scenes for the new doors of the Baptistery required two things: one, that they should be brilliant (illustri), the other, that the should be meaningful (significanti). "Brilliant" I call those that can feast the eye well by their variety of de- sign. "Meaningful" I call those that have importance (importanza) worthy of remembrance.82 132</page><page sequence="33">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE 37) Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti, (&lt;Father of the Church). Marble, H. 238 cm, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence. Certainly, these qualities of "brilliance" and "meaningful- ness" as defined by Bruni would seem to me to describe Donatello's achievement. But he also goes on to say that he "would like very much to get together with the one who is to design it, to get him to pick up every little meaning that the story carries."83 Such an interaction between the sculptor and an advisor is precisely what Alberti recommends to the painter in de Pictura when he is composing his "historia." It seems to me that the intention is exactly the same for the "historia," as it were, of a sculpted figure. Alberti's passage sums up Donatello and Brunelleschi's way of working and the interaction between them. When we are about to paint a "historia," Alberti says, we will always ponder at some length on the order and the means by which the composition might best be done. We will work out the whole historia and each of its parts by working sketch models on paper, and take advice on it with all our friends. We will endeavour to have every- thing so well worked out beforehand that there will be nothing in the picture whose exact collocation we do not know perfectly. In order that we may know this with greater certainty, it will help to divide our models into parallels, so that everything can be then transferred, as it were, from our private papers and put into position in the work for public exhibition.84 From the early figures at Pistoia this seems to have been Brunelleschi's method, for the innovatory nature of these fig- ures suggests that he took thought as to how best they might be done, that he made drawings to establish the collocation of their parts so that when put in place they would achieve the memorable impact he intended. Whether he took advice on this in his early years is, of course, open to question, but in the case of Donatello, I would suggest that he not only took advice from his friend Brunelleschi on such practical matters as how to effect his figures in their eventual locations, but that he also sought Brunelleschi's advice on how best to real- ize, in their conception, the full significance of their meaning. I have tried to show how the sculptures Brunelleschi and Donatello produced in Florence in the early part of the fif- teenth century were so designed in relationship to their envi- ronment as to interact with the world of the contemporary viewer and to make an immediate impact by their presence, in order to elicit an imaginative recreation on the viewer's part of the deeper meanings they were intended to convey. Unlike earlier statuary they do not rely on traditional identifi- 133</page><page sequence="34">ROGER TARR cations, but demand an awareness on the part of the viewer whose active participation is sought to find a new sense of the numinous in the experience of everyday life. In de Pictura, Alberti wrote: We should consider it a great gift to man that painting has represented the Gods they worship, for painting has con- tributed considerably to the piety which binds us to the Gods, and to filling our minds with sound religious be- liefs. It is said that Phidias made a statue of Jove in Elis, whose beauty added not a little to received religion.85 It seems clear that by using a sculpture to make his point, Alberti saw a correlation in the purpose and effectiveness of both arts in not only enhancing but also expanding religious awareness. He may well have had in mind Brunelleschi's method as it was demonstrated in the sculpture of Donatello, for he dedicated the Italian text of his book on painting to Brunelleschi in 1436 in the very year that the "Zuccone," which might be seen as exemplifying the epitome of Donatello's "giudizio" and "fantasia" was finished for the Campanile. He was aware in de Statua of how sculptors should seek indi- viduality in their figures through the careful balance of form or ethos and attitude or pathos, so that, as he says: If I am not mistaken, the sculptor's art of achieving like- ness is directed to two ends: one is that the image he makes should resemble this particular creature, say a man. They are not concerned to represent the portrait of I should like to thank my colleague Michael Bury for reading an early draft of this article and making some very valuable suggestions. 1 See A. Manetti, The Life of Brunelleschi (intro. and annotated by H. Saalman), Pennsylvania, 1970, pp. 50-55. For this trip and a discussion of some aspects of the contact between Brunelleschi and Donatello, see G. Castelfranco, "Sui rapporti tra Brunelleschi e Donatello," Arte Antica e Moderna, 34/5 (1966), pp. 109-22, and J.

Socrates or Plato or some known person, believing they have done enough if they have succeeded in making their work like a man, albeit an unknown one. The other end is the one pursued by those who strive to imitate not simply a man, but the face and entire appearance of the body of one particular man, say Caesar or Cato in this attitude and this dress, either seated or speaking in court, or some other known person.86 The criterion is that each individual figure should possess a believable quality of active experience which informs its movement and its demeanour; a quality called "praxis" by Aristotle and the true end of poetic imitation.87 Alberti then goes on to explain his two complimentary systems of mea- surement to be used to achieve this appearance of immediacy and vitality. His overall method should be seen as conceptual as much as practical; an attempt perhaps to rationalize Donatello's achievement. Donatello, as we know, would have had no time for such laborious procedures. Nor, from what we know of him, would Phidias, who is, for Alberti, both the yardstick and the epitome of excellence in sculpture.88 It is not Alberti's practice to speak of contemporary artists in his treatises, but I would suggest that, as the spirit of Masaccio seems to lie beneath the surface of the de Pictura, so the spirit of Donatello seems to lie beneath that of the de Statua. Per- haps Alberti saw in Donatello's work visible proof that an- cient sculpture was alive again, and that in Donatello there was, in the Florence of his time, a true Phidias reborn. 3 See G. Vasari, "Vita di Filippo Brunelleschi," Le Vite, ed. G. Milanese, vol. II, Firenze, 1906, pp. 333-34, and, "Vita di Donato," Le Vite, vol. II, pp. 398-99. 4 See G. Poggi, II Duomo di Firenze, Berlin, 1909, doc. 423, p. 77. Here Brunelleschi is called "orafo" (goldsmith), and Donatello "intagliatore" (sculptor). Perhaps these descriptions suggest their different responsibilities. 5 See, II Libro di Antonio Billi, a cura di Annamaria Ficarra, Naples, n.d., p. 41, and C.

Beck, "Ghiberti giovane e Donatello giovanissimo," in Lorenzo Ghiberti nel suo tempo, Florence, 1980, pp. 111-34 suggests that Donatello may have been an apprentice to Brunelleschi in Pistoia and that he executed a half-length figure iden- tified as either David or Daniel for the silver altar. Pope-Hennessy agrees with the former proposal, but rejects the attribution. (See Pope- Hennessy, Donatello, p. 14 and p. 319, note 11,) 8 See L. Gai, L'Altare argenteo di San Jacopo nel Duomo di Pistoia, Turin, 1984, pp. 152-55, and n. 10, p. 200. For an excellent discussion of the documents and attribution of the figures, see L. Gai, "I primissimi anni dell'attivita brunelleschiana: le opere di oreficeria," in E. Battisti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Milan, 1976, pp. 22-30. 9 Donatello's name appears in a list of workers relating to the period 1404-07 (see R. Krautheimer, Lorenzo Ghiberti, Princeton, 1970, vol. II, doc. 28, p. 369), and in a list of workers on the first bronze doors which, according to Krautheimer, refers to the period 1407-15. Donatello, who is being paid at fl. 75 per year (the highest rate), has only received a fraction of that, so presumably he had only been working a month or so when the list was compiled (see Krautheimer, Lorenzo Ghiberti, doc. 31, pp. 369-70). 10 See Gai, LAltare argenteo di San Jacopo nel Duomo di Pistoia, pp. 15-29. Castelfranco identifies a new spirit in these figures which is related neither to Gothic sculpture nor to late trecento classicism. He calls this a sense of "physical energy" (energia fisica) showing a "visible concentration of will and thought" (concentrazione visibile della volonta e delpensiero) which is different from the preconceived methodism of the Gothic style (see Castelfranco, "Sui rapporti tra Brunelleschi e Donatello," p. 111). 11 The altar is now encased in glass. In its present position I have been unable to photograph the figure for the glass presents a reflective surface to the camera and it is not possible to light the figure adequately. I have been unable to obtain permission to remove the glass. A drawing made by me suggests how the figure looks from the best view. The lower part of the drawing of the legs up to the book is taken from a photograph made from the low angle ap- proximating to the intended viewing-angle suggested here.

Da Costa Kaufmann, "The Perspective of Shadows: the History of the theory of Shadow Projection," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes XXXVIII (1975), pp. 258-87. For the early fifteenth century and the possibility of this method being used by artists of the time, see G. Bauer, "Experimental Shadow Casting and the early History of Perspective," The Art Bulletin LXIX (1987), pp. 211-19. Bauer cites an often overlooked passage at the end of Alberti's de Statua, which uses the example of a cast shadow to demonstrate how the section of a three-dimensional figure can be found as equivalent to the intersection of the visual pyramid. The passage reads in Grayson's translation: It is also very important to understand how we observe the out- lines of the body by sections. For, if someone cuts an upright cylinder so that the part you can see is divided from the part you cannot see from the same position, two bodies are made out of this cylinder, though their base remains equal and the same, and they are still contained in four lines and circles. The same is true of our observation by sections of the body. There is an outline at which the surface we see from a particular viewpoint ends and is separated from the other we cannot see by virtue of the part which stands between; and this outline, if it were drawn properly on a wall, would produce a figure exactly like the one a shadow would make by interception of light, if the source of light were placed at the same point in space where the eye of the observer had been before. Although Alberti says that this is, "more a matter for the painter than the sculptor," he goes on to say that it is of primary importance for the sculptor, "to know how from a fixed position of the perpendicu- lars lies the maximum and minimum projection of each limb." (see L. B. Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, [trans. and intro. C. Grayson], London, 1972, pp. 138-39]). In the phrase, "prominentiave retractriove ab certa linearum positione," and in the sense of this sentence, I think there is an echo of a passage in Vitruvius where he is speaking about scene-painting and, "how what is figured upon vertical and plane surfaces can seem to recede in one part and project in another," (...quae in directis planisque frontibus sint figurata, alia abscedentia, alia prominentia esse videantur), see Vitruvius, de Architectura, Bk. VII, Pref. 11. (ed. F Granger), London, 1970, vol. II, pp. 70-71. 16 The use of some kind of perspective projection from a ground- plan and elevation has sometimes been put forward as one way of explaining how Brunelleschi made his perspective panel. A simple statement of the method is found in E. Panofsky, Early Netherlandish Painting, Cambridge, Mass., 1964, vol. I, pp. 3-5, and in Krautheimer, Lorenzo Ghiberti, vol. I, pp. 238-40. The system of using the co- ordinates of plan, elevation and perspective is implied by Vitruvius in the de Architectura. (See Vitruvius, de Architectura, Bk. I, ch. 2, vol. I, pp. 24-27.) Matthaus Roriczer's diagrams give some idea that such a method was practiced during the middle ages (see M. Roriczer, I/ Libro delle proporzioni delle guglie, Regensberg, 1486, printed in, F Borsi, Per una storia della teoria delle proporzioni, Firenze, 1967, Appendix 2). In relation to sculpture, Alberti's use of a horizontal and vertical scale for the measurement of figures suggests a conception similar to this kind of architectural construction at least in envisaging how a figure might look in space (see Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, pp. 117-39). 17 For the Uomini Singholari, see Creighton E. Gilbert, Italian Art 1400-1500, Englewood Cliffs, 1980, p. 195, and P Murray, "XIV Uomini Singholari in Firenze dal MCCCC innanzi," The Burlington Magazine 99 (1957), pp. 330-36. 18 See Plato, The Sophist, 235-36 (ed. and trans. H. N. Fowler), London, 1977, pp. 334-35. Vitruvius recognized that modifications to 135</page><page sequence="36">ROGER TARR the symmetries of buildings might be made to achieve what he calls, eurythmy. (See Vitruvius, de Architectura, Bk. VI, ch. 2, pp. 20-23.) But, as he explains, this is achieved by, "native skill" (ingeniorum acuminibus), rather than by rule. This may also be the additional skill necessary for the sculptor in making figures in poses where the basic proportions are modified as Alberti recognizes at the end of de Statua (see Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, para. 13, pp. 138-39). Knowledge of such methods outside immediate artistic circles is given by an entry in the notebooks of the Florentine merchant, Giovanni Rucellai, who was in Rome in 1450 and wrote of one of the columns he saw there as, "a column, like to a Campanile, 50 braccia high or thereabouts which was made for the Emperor Hadrian in place of a triumphal arch. It is of marble and decorated with scenes of the vic- tories he won. And it was made with such skill that the figures above and in the middle seem to be as big as those below and in truth they are much bigger" (see G. Rucellai, l Zibaldone, London, 1960, vol. I, p. 75). On the general issue, see R. Stagg, On the Question of Optical Compensation in Italian Renaissance Sculpture, Ann Arbor, 1976. On Donatello in particular, see R. Munman, Optical Corrections in the sculpture of Donatello, Philadelphia, 1985. The distortion of lower to upper parts of figures especially those seated can be seen in both classical and medieval sculpture. A classical example might be the Demeter from Knidos now in the British Museum. An immediate medieval example might be the thirteenth century figures on the fa- cade of Wells Cathedral. 19 This group is discussed by A. M. Romanini,Arno/fo di Cambio, Milan, 1969, pp. 108-16. 20 Manetti says of Arnolfo's model for the dome: "Although Filippo later vaulted it in a different manner, he used to say that if it could have been done with centering nothing would have been bet- ter than that model" (See Manetti, The Life of Brunelleschi, pp. 68- 69.) 21 This group is inscribed 1399. Its attribution is uncertain. See G. R. Goldner, Niccolo and Piero Lamberti, Ann Arbor, 1978, pp. 19- 25, who, following Venturi, Pope-Hennessy and others, gives it to Niccolb di Pietro Lamberti. 22 The Anonimo Magliabecchiano (see Frey, II Codice Maglia- becchiano, p. 75) says that, "it is in the first tabernacle next to the central door" (e in 1 tabernaculo a canto alla porta del mezo). Ac- cording to R. Munman, "The Evangelists for the Cathedral in Flo- rence," The Art Bulletin (June, 1980), pp. 207 ff., the St. John was directly to the right of the main door when the viewer is facing the Cathedral. 23 See C. Seymour Jnr., Sculpture in Italy 1400-1500, Harmond- sworth, 1966, pp. 54-58, pi. 13. His view is taken from a position in front of the central door supposing the figure to be immediately to the right as Munman suggests. For reasons which seem to me to be unconvincing, M. Greenhalgh rejects any suggestion that the figure is adapted to be seen from below. (See M. Greenhalgh, Donatello and his Sources, London, 1982, pp. 41-42.) Pope-Hennessy, Donatello, p. 25 and note 28, p. 321, accepts the adaption of proportions of the figure to suit its intended site and also points out that the carving of the pupils gives the figure an appropriately focused gaze. 24 John 1. 6-7. 25 The distinction of ethos (character) from pathos (emotion) made by Plato, was given new emphasis by Aristotle for whom the former signified the constant intrinsic moral quality of character, the latter the changeable aspect of character when moved fron without. (for ethos, see Aristotle, Poetics, 1448a 1-6 and 1450a 17-28. In both passages Aristotle refers to painters by way of comparison [see S. H. Butcher, Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, London, 1951, pp. 10-11 and pp. 26-7]). For pathos in relation to the emotions, see Aristotle, Poetics, 1453b 15-22 (as 'suffering' in general), 1455a 29- 32 (here as sympathetic emotion through gesture) and 1456 a 37- 1456 b 1 (for pathos as part of rhetoric in the excitation of feeling) (see Butcher, Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, pp. 48-51, pp. 60-3 and pp. 68-71). On ethos and pathos in oratory, which would seem relevant to sculpture since Quintilian later made the connection between the two arts, see the Art of Rhetoric, 1877b 42 ff., where Aristotle shows how the former is the essential quality of the speaker, the latter the emotion which moves his discourse displayed in voice, gesture and attitude. The listener's response depends on a sympathy with the emotion conveyed and a belief in its appropriateness to the speaker's character. (See Aristotle, The Art of Rhetoric, trans. and intro. J. H. Freese, London, 1975, pp. 168 ff.). Alberti's two practical tools described in de Statua for establishing basic proportions and their movement and change in action may be seen to correspond to Aristotle's idea of the inter-balance of ethos and pathos in the active human figure. (See Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, pp. 123 ff.) 26 Vasari, Le Vite, vol. II, p. 398. 27 Both figures are made of wood and polychromed. For the attribution and date of the Sta. Maria Novella Crucifix, see Battisti, Filippo Brunelleschi, p. 344. I have accepted the usual identification of Donatello's figure with the Crucifix in Santa Croce (see H. W. Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, Princeton, 1963, pp. 7-12). A. Parronchi, in my view erroneously, has attributed this figure to Nanni di Banco (see A. Parronchi, "Su tre crocifissi," Donatello e il potere, Florence, 1980, pp. 51-85) 28 I owe this observation to my friend Dr. James Lawson. 29 See Vitruvius, de Architectura, Bk. III, ch. I, vol. I, pp. 158-59. 30 See Brunelleschi Scultore, a cura di E. Micheletti e A. Paolucci, Florence, 1977, pp. 33-38. 31 The overall figure, which may depend on the Giottesque cru- cifix now in the sacristy in Sta. Maria Novella, measures 170 cm. x 170 cm., giving a square format. This corresponds to Cennino Cennini's advice in Ch. XX of hisLibro dell'Arte (see Cennino Cennini, II Libro dell'Arte, a cura di F. Tempesti, Milan, p. 74). A circle can be inscribed from the navel, its perimeter touching the extremities of hands and feet, corresponding basically to Vitruvius' description. (See Vitruvius, de Architectura, Bk. III, ch. I, vol. I, pp. 160-61.) For a dis- cussion of these proportions, see C. Ragghianti, Filippo Brunelleschi, un uomo, un universo, Firenze 1977, pp. 362-65. On the use of the homo quadratus, as described by Vitruvius, see J. Brink, "Carpentry and Symmetry in Cimabue's Santa Croce Crucifix," The Burlington Magazine (1978), pp. 645-53. 32 See II Libro di Antonio Billi, p. 31. 33 See A. Parronchi, "Brunelleschi, 'un nuovo S. Paolo,"' Paragone (1961). (also in, A Parronchi, Studi sulla Dolce Prospettiva, Milan, 1966, pp. 415-28). For Brunelleschi and Dante, see A.

Whether this means that the perspective demonstration panels were done by then is a moot point, but it does suggest that as early as 1413 he had a reputation for his interest in perspective. The term "prespettivo" 136</page><page sequence="37">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE should be taken in the medieval sense of the natural science of optics rather than as "perspective" in the modern sense of the term.

Tanturli, "Rapporti del Brunelleschi con gli ambienti litterari fiorentini," Convegno Internazionale di Studi Brunelleschiani, Florence, 16-22 Ott., 1977, p. 1 ff.. 38 See Manetti, The Life of Brunelleschi, pp. 50-51. Manetti links Brunelleschi's intellectual understanding of sculpture with that of buildings, when he says, in Rome, "...nelghuardare le scolture come quello che aveva buono occhio mentale e aveduto in tutte le chose vide el modo del murare degli antichi e le loro simetrie...." On this point see also C. del Bravo, "II Brunelleschi e la speranza," Artibus et Historiae (1981), pp. 57-72. 39 See Poggi, II Duomo di Firenze, docs. 411-21, pp. 76-7, and Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, pp. 14-15, and H. W. Janson, "The Meaning of the Giganti," II Duomo di Milano (Congresso Internazionale, Milan, 1968), Milan, 1969, pp. 77-103 (reprinted in, H. W. Janson, 16 Studies, New York, n.d. pp. 303-31). B. A. Bennett and D. G. Wilkins, Donatello, Oxford, 1984, pp. 193-94, discuss the statue and reproduce a view of Florence Cathedral in 1684 showing a colossal figure, probably the Joshua, in situ on the tribune. 40 Poggi, // Duomo di Firenze, docs. 405-12, pp. 75-76. 41 Poggi, i/ Duomo di Firenze, doc. 413, p. 76. 42 The identification of the two figures called, "Isaiah" and "David" in the documents is not entirely clear. The usual identification of the "Isaiah" with the figure now in the Cathedral and the "David" with the marble figure in the Bargello, given to Nanni di Banco and Donatello respectively, has been challenged by Manfred Wundram who argues that the "Isaiah" should be identified with a "bearded prophet," now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, and the figure in the Cathedral should be seen as the "David," the former being by Nanni di Banco, the latter by Donatello. (see M. Wundram, "Donatello und Nanni di Banco negli anni 1408-09," Donatello e il suo tempo, Florence, 1968, pp. 69-71, and M. Wundram, Donatello und Nanni di Banco, Berlin, 1969, pp. 62-69 and 150-52. See also Bennett and Wilkins, Donatello, p. 228, note 18 for a review of opinions up until 1984). Pope-Hennessy has recently persuasively proposed that the "bearded prophet," "its lips parted, as though in song" is the "David" of the documents and, therefore by Donatello and that the "Isaiah" by Nanni di Banco is, as was previously thought, the marble statue in the Duomo. (See Pope- Hennessy, Donatello, pp. 17-18.) 43 Poggi, I Duomo di Firenze, doc. 423, p. 77. It should be noted that the document refers to "figure," so it must be assumed that the modello was to serve as a general demonstration of how all the fig- ures intended for the tribune might be done rather than for a single figure. Of course, the idea of having figures at this height around the Cathedral is registered in the painting of the Cathedral as envisaged in the 1360's by Andrea da Firenze in the Chapter House of S. Maria Novella. 44 Poggi, /I Duomo di Firenze, doc. 220, pp. 36-37. Donatello's St. John the Evangelist was placed on the facade on October 8th. 1415, on the same day as Ciuffagni's St. Matthew. The fact that Donatello was paid more may reflect the acknowledgement of the success of his figure as against that of Ciuffagni which is very similar to it in pose, but lacks the subtlety of its adjusted proportions. 45 Poggi, II Duomo di Firenze, doc. 210, p. 35. The four sculp- tures were boarded into the chapels in which they were being worked on were in 1410 in order that they should not be seen ("...ita quod non videantur") (see Poggi, II Duomo di Firenze, doc. 186, p. 31). However, Donatello was not given money for a key to close his chapel until Jan. 24th 1415, only nine months before the St. John was set up. The similarity of Ciuffagni's St. Matthew to the St. John suggests that he had seen Donatello's figure, but had not understood the subtlety of the adjusted proportions. Ciuffagni himself was given money for a key to his chapel after his St. Matthew was set up, so presumably this was to keep other work he had undertaken for the Operai safe. (See Poggi, II Duomo di Firenze, doc. 223, p. 37.) 46 The "Apostle" may have been done as part of a scheme for twelve figures for the buttresses of the Cathedral which had been drawn up in 1409. However work was not begun until 1411 at the earliest. (See C. Seymour Jnr., Jacopo della Quercia, New Haven and London, 1973, pp. 36-37, and J. Beck, Jacopo della Quercia, New York, 1991, vol I, pp. 156-57, who recognizes the compensation in the figure for "natural distortion when viewed from below".) Jacopo was in Lucca in 1413, but was forced to flee the city in December of that year. It is not known whether he had begun work on the "Apostle" by then, though Seymour dates it to 1412 on grounds of style. He was not back in Lucca until 1416. He seems to have gone to Siena where he had the unfinished Fonte Gaia still in hand. In documents relating to the period from May to August 1415, a Florentine, Jacopo di Corso, called Papi, joined Jacopo in Siena, perhaps suggesting a visit by Jacopo to Florence in the early part of 1415. (See O. Morisani, Jacopo della Quercia, Milano, 1962, pp. 47-49.) Morisani, Jacopo della Quercia, p. 66 dates the 'Apostle" to 1417-22 on the grounds of the similarity he sees in its overall liveliness and in the individual features such as the head to Donatello's St. George. 47 See Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, pp. 16-17. The doc. of April 29, 1413, provides for the figure and tabernacle being fin- ished "to the extent necessary" (di quanto vi mancha). Does this mean that it was at this point that Donatello was asked to finish it and did not do so according to Vasari's story? I cannot agree with Wundram who argues that the St. Mark post-dates the St. George and was not begun substantially until 1415 and was probably not finished until nearer 1420 (see Wundram, Donatello und Nanni di Banco, Berlin, 1969, pp. 49-55). 48 See I/ Libro diAntonio Billi, pp. 32 and 41; Gilbert, Italian Art 1400-1500, p. 195; Frey, II Codice Magliabecchiano, pp. 66 and 75. 49 See Vasari, Le Vite, vol. II, pp. 401-02. 50 See Vasari, Le Vite, vol. II, p. 403. The quality of giudizio emphasised by Vasari in the context of the appearance of the figure can be related to the "ingeniorum acuminibus" recognized by Vitruvius as essential in the eurythmy of buildings (see above note 18). Donatello's disdain for the over-elaborate complexities of applied perspective is reflected in his chiding of Uccello on that account (see Vasari, "Vita di Paolo Uccello," Le Vite, vol. II, pp. 205-06) It is also shown in the well-known story, recorded by Pomponius Gauricus, of Donatello's reply to the nobleman who asked to see his abacus, that he had no other abacus than that which he always carried with him, namely his skill of hand and eye (see P Gauricus, de Sculptura, ed. A. Chastel et R. Klein, Paris, 1969, pp. 64-65). 51 This painting demonstrates the different problems of visual foreshortening encountered by the painter and the sculptor. In the figure of St. Mark the distortion of the image in the vertical plane is possible in both painting and sculpture. In the seated figure of the Virgin, Paolo Schiavo has clearly used Donatello's St. John the Evan- gelist as his model as is shown by the disposition of the drapery over the lower torso and legs. However, as the distortion of the St. John needs to be resolved vertically as well as in three dimensions the painted Madonna cannot resolve itself in depth in the same way at least so far as a photograph can show. This is mainly because the 137</page><page sequence="38">ROGER TARR viewing point is to one side rather than straight in front. Gentile da Fabriano's Madonna and Child in Orvieto, however, which also seems to refer to the St. John is to be seen more or less from straight in front and so resolves its distortion more like a standing figure when seen from below. 52 According to G. B. Gelli in his Vite d'artisti (see G. Mancini [ed.] Archivio storico italiano, 5, serie, XVII, 1896, p. 59) 53 See Gilbert, Italian Art 1440-1500, p. 195, "in the tabernacle on the exterior of Or san Michele [Donatello made] the St. George, the St. Peter and the St. Mark, marvelous works....." See also F Albertini, Memoriale di molte statue... di Florentia..., Firenze 1510 (ed. Letchworth, 1909) p. 15. 54 See / Libro diAntonio Billi, pp. 32 and 41, and Frey, II Codice Magliabecchiano, pp. 66 and 75. Vasari, who admired the figure, calling it, "savissime e mirabile," says it was a collaboration in his Life of Brunelleschi, but that it was by Donatello alone in his Life of Donatello. (See Vasari, Le Vite, Vol. II, pp. 334 and 402). Castelfranco maintains the view that the St. Peter is a collaboration between Donatello and Brunelleschi (see Castelfranco, "Sui rapporti tra Brunelleschi e Donatello," pp. 115-16.) 55 Matt. 16. 18-19. 56 See L. B. Alberti, della Pittura, preface, dedicated to Brunelleschi in 1436. (see Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, pp. 32-33). Brunelleschi first provided a model for the dome in 1417 but no doubt he envisaged its construction before then. (See Battisti, Brunelleschi, p. 114.) Perhaps the St. Peter, possibly made in the years just prior to 1417, bears witness to that vision. 57 Manetti does say that Brunelleschi worked in other materials besides bronze, and, of course, the Crucifix and the lost Magdalen he describes were in wood. He does not specify marble, but perhaps Brunelleschi's contemporaries, from whom he says he got his infor- mation, knew of things in this material. (See Manetti, Life of Brunelleschi, pp. 40-41.) Brunelleschi's assistant and disciple, il Buggiano, certainly worked in marble. (See II Libro di Antonio Billi, p. 35.) 58 Pope-Hennessy has recently also suggested that the design of the St. Peter is "strongly Brunelleschan" although he agrees with the prevailing view that its actual execution was by Ciuffagni. (See Pope-Hennessy, Donatello, p. 322.) 59 The marble for the base of the St. George tabernacle was sold to the Armourers and Swordsmiths Guild in 1417 by the Cathedral workshop (see Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, pp. 23-24). Janson argues that the main figure was done by then (see Janson The Sculp- ture of Donatello, p. 26). This dating is generally agreed. 60 Filarete, Trattato dell'architettura, Bk. XXIII, written between c. 1451 and c. 1464 (see Antonio Averlino detto Filarete, Trattato di Architettura, testo a cura di A. M. Finoli e L. Grassi, Milan, 1972, vol. II, p. 658). 61 F. Bocchi, Eccellenza della statua di San Giorgio di Donatello, first printed in Florence in 1584. (See Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, p. 25.) 62 Vasari describes St. George as "armed" (armato) (see Vasari, Le Vite, vol. II, p. 403). Drill holes in the head and the grip of the right hand suggest a helmet and a sword, appropriate to the Armourer's Guild, which were probably made of bronze. This is discussed by Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, p. 26. However, Janson in the note to this discussion points out that when Raphael drew the figure early in the sixteenth century, he shows neither helmet nor sword. 63 See Ephesians 6. 10-20. In the now lostDovizia, made around 1430 for the Mercato Vecchio, Donatello also gave form to the ab- stract idea of "abundance" or "civic wealth" (see D. G. Wilkins, "Donatello's Lost Dovizia for the Mercato Vecchio: Wealth and Char- ity as Florentine Civic Virtues," The Art Bulletin 65 (1983), pp. 401-23, and, S. B. Wilk, "Donatello's Dovizia as an Image of Florentine Politi- cal Propaganda," Artibus et Historiae XIV [1986]). This statue stood on a column in the Mercato until the eighteenth century (see Bennett, Wilkins, Donatello, pp. 71-73). 64 See D. F. Zervas, The Parte Guelfa, Brunelleschi and Donatello, New York, 1987, pp. 101-61. Zervas argues that the all'antica features of the architecture of the St. Louis tabernacle suggest Donatello's design. However, the syntax of the underlying architectural structure shows such strong similarities to Brunelleschi's style, say, on the con- temporary Innocenti Loggia, to further suggest the close interaction between him and Donatello at this time. 65 See J. White, "Paragone: Aspects of the Relationship between Sculpture and Painting," Art, Science and History in the Renaissance, Baltimore, 1967, pp. 43-108. This positive interpretation of the statue should be compared with the stories in circulation in the 16th C. that Donatello made his statue clumsy on purpose for who but a fool would renounce a kingdom (see Gelli, Vite d'artisti, p. 59, and Vasari, Le Vite, vol. II, p. 416). 66 See Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, pp. 48-50. 67 See Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, p. 46. 68 See Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, pp. 33-35. 69 See J. Pope-Hennessy, Italian Gothic Sculpture, London, 1955, pp. 193-94. 70 The sequence of execution of Giovanni Pisano's sculptures is not documented, but on grounds of style and expression there seems to be a progression from a passive to an active representation of the figures' interaction with each other and with the spectator. 71 See above note 68. 72 Genesis 22.13. 73 Ghiberti, in his "Commentaries" written probably in the 1450s, says he saw casts or copies ("le cose formate delle sue") of the work of a northern goldsmith (called, Gusmin, according to an early 16th C. source), sometime early in the century probably around 1430. (See Lorenzo Ghiberti, I Commentari, a cura di O. Morisani, Naples, 1947, pp. 40-41.) Michelozzo, Donatello's co-worker on several projects in the 1420s was of Burgundian stock, although his father had settled in Florence well before he was born. (See M. Ferrara e F Quinterio, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo, Florence, 1984, p. 11, and, J. Pope- Hennessy, Italian Renaissance Sculpture, London, 1958, p. 288.) For the relationship between Donatello and Michelozzo at this period, see R. Lightbown, Donatello and Michelozzo, an Artistic Partnership and its Patrons in the Early Renaissance, 2 vols. London, 1980. 74 For the trip to Rome, see Bennett and Wilkins, Donatello, pp. 56-57, and Lightbown, Donatello and Michelozzo, vol. I, p. 235. For the Habakkuk, see Poggi, II Duomo di Firenze, docs. 316 and 322-24, pp. 57-58. 75 See Gelli, Vite d'artisti, p. 58 and Vasari, Le Vite, vol. II, pp. 404-05. 76 Habakkuk 1.2. 77 Jeremiah 7.34. The debate as to the identity of these two figures in the light of the documentation still continues, as can be seen from the fact that in two recent books on Donatello, the authors differ (see Pope-Hennessy, Donatello, pp. 326-27, who accepts the identification given here, and J. Poeschke, Donatello and his World, New York, 1993, pp. 381-83, who identifies the "Habbakuk" of the documents as the figure here called "Jeremiah"). I cannot agree with Patricia Rose's interesting suggestion that the Zuccone represents 138</page><page sequence="39">BRUNELLESCHI AND DONATELLO: PLACEMENT AND MEANING IN SCULPTURE Elisha on grounds of its baldness and the emphasis on the cloak representing the double spirit of Elijah he inherited, as this entails accepting the Zuccone as the earlier of the two statues (see P Rose, "Bears, Baldness, and the Double Spirit: The Identity of Donatello's Zuccone," The Art Bulletin LXIII (1981), pp. 31-41). 78 For this suggestion, see G. Brunetti, "Un aggiunta all'iconografia Brunelleschiana: ipotesi sul 'profeta imberbe' di Donatello," Filippo Brunelleschi: la sua opera e il suo tempo, Florence, 1977, vol. I, pp. 273-77. J. Paoletti, "Donatello and Brunelleschi: An Early Renaissance Portrait," Commentari XXI (1970), pp. 55-60, sees a portrait of Brunelleschi in one of the figures in Donatello's Feast of Herod relief in Siena. The idea that artists might include a portrait of a mentor or friend in their work is given some credence by Alberti's request in de Pictura that he might be included as a mark of respect for his written labours. (See Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, Bk. III, para. 63, pp. 104-07.) Alberti also suggests that artists should include a well-known person to attract the viewer's attention (see Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, Bk. III, para. 56, pp. 100-01). In the sixteenth century, Donatello's Habakkuk and Jeremiah were seen as portraits of people known to him, one of whom was drawn from the life ("ritratta al naturale") according to Antonio Billi (see / Libro di Antonio Billi, p. 41; for other refs., see Janson, The Sculpture of Donatello, p. 35). 79 In theRepublic, the corporate harmony of the state is founded on Plato's conception of the tripartite individual soul in which the same forces of appetite, action and understanding register the balance of achievement. By such an analogy, the viewer is asked to equate his responsibility for the good of the community with his responsibility for himself. The programme allows the viewer the opportunity to fix in his mind a world picture, related to his own life by both theology and philosophy, within which the transcendent ideals of faith and justice find their proper place. Although Manuel Chrysoloras did not make his translation of the Republic until he moved to Pavia in 1402 (see G. Voigt, II risorgimento dell'antichita classica, Florence, 1968, vol. I, p. 229). He had been in Florence since the end of 1396 and may well have conveyed a knowledge of it to his pupils there. However, the response to Plato's republican ideas in Florence was not uncriti- cal. Leonardo Bruni, for example, one of Chrisoloras's best pupils did not make a translation of the Republic quite specifically because of doubts over the propriety of some of the views expressed in it. (See G. Holmes, The Florentine Enlightenment 1400-50, London, 1969, pp. 114ff.) Carlo del Bravo, "II Brunelleschi e la speranza," (see note 38 above) suggests that Plato's emphasis on abstract understanding as the first stage in the process of thought, as expressed in the Republic (vii. 533-34, 511), influenced Brunelleschi, who may have come across Chrysoloras at a formative period in his life, when Chrysoloras was perhaps translating Plato's text. 80 The four Fathers of the Church were made in white marble between 1395 and 1401. (See Poggi, II Duomo di Firenze, docs. 111-15, 121-25, 127-46, pp. 19-25.) They were made to drawings supplied by the painter Agnolo Gaddi (doc. 112). According to the documents, Jerome and Ambrose were by Piero di Giovanni Tedesco and Augustine and Gregory were by Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti. Four standing figures (which seem to fall stylistically into two pairs) are now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo. It is possible to relate each of these pairs to the known style of the two sculptors cited in the documents. However, as the figures carry no specific attributes or identifications (the poets' laurel crowns worn by three of them are later additions, probably of the seventeenth century, see Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, a cura di L. Becherucci e G. Brunetti, Venice, n.d., vol. I, p. 254), it is not exactly clear which Doctor is which. Although the documents are clear as to the progress of the work, they are less so regarding the exact location of the figures on the facade. Two documents are significant here. The first, dated Aug. 29th 1396 (doc. 122), says that when finished they should be placed in four existing large tabernacles, two on either side, near the ground, next to the main door of the church of Sta. Reparata (ie. the Cathe- dral), on the front facade of the said church (postea ponantur et poni debeant in quattuor tabernaculis mangnis existentibus duobus ex utraque parte, prope terram et iuxta ianuam maiorum ecclesie S. Reparata, in facie anteriori dicte ecclesie). The second, dated Mar. 14th 1400 (1401 n.s., doc. 140), says they should be placed above ("supra") the doors which face the piazza San Giovanni. (...mictantur supra portas que sunt ante plateam S. Johannis). The specific nature of the earlier document suggests to me that the "supra" in the second is used vaguely to denote their intended position and that we can deduce, therefore, that the Fathers of the Church were originally to go in tabernacles on either side of the main door which were subsequently occupied by the four Evangelists. The famous late 16th C. drawing of the facade with the latter in situ shows that they could well be described as "prope terram" in relation to the rest of the building. It is hard to see from this drawing where any tabernacles "above" the doors as such would have been. Also, there are only three doors for four statues. The other piece of surviving pictorial evidence is the damaged fragment of a fresco of the Baptistery and the facade now in the Museo di Santa Croce. This shows standing figures in tabernacles in similar positions in relation to the ground as those later occupied by the Evangelists. However, they are spaced out across the facade, one between each door, rather than being two on either side of the main portal as doc. 122 provides. The date of this fresco is unknown, so it is impossible to say whether it represents a misreading of the conjunction of the figures on the facade or perhaps some other earlier scheme which was proposed and then modified. Goldner, Niccolo and Piero Lamberti, pp. 26-28, discusses the placement of the Fathers of the Church, but fails to take into account doc. 122, so assumes the figures were always intended to be above the doors. G. Brunetti agrees that the Fathers of the Church were for the taber- nacles later occupied by the Evangelists (see / Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, vol. I, pp. 254-55). The balance of evidence is that the Evangelists were done to replace rather than to compliment the earlier figures of the four Fathers. The height of the standing fig- ures, 2.27 m. and 2.34 m. roughly matches the height of the seated figures, 2.10 m. for the St. John, so the same tabernacles would have been adequate for both sets of figures (for the measurements, see I Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, vol. I, pp. 254-55 and pp. 261- 64). 81 The painted wooden Magdalen, described by Manetti as, "life- size-or a little less than life-size-...in the round.... which was de- stroyed when the church of Santo Spirito burned in 1471," (see Manetti, The Life of Brunelleschi, pp. 40-41) is not dated, but a termi- nus ante quem for its completion is provided by a will of Feb. 22nd 1420 (1421 n.s.) in which it is said to be in the chapel of St. Matthew and an endowment is made for masses to be said continually for the soul of the testator, Matteo di Jacopo Corbinelli. (See Battisti, Brunelleschi, p. 344, and, C. Botto, "L'edificazione della Chiesa di Santo Spirito in Firenze,"RivistaArte, ser. 2, III[XII], 1931, p. 482.) Billi, who is the earliest known source for the story of the competition of the two crucifixes, also says that the Magdalen was done in competition with Donatello's which was then in the Baptistery. (See II Libro di Antonio Billi, p. 32.) 139</page><page sequence="40">ROGER TARR 82 See Gilbert, Italian Art 1400-1500, p. 164. (Italian text in Creighton E. Gilbert, L'Arte del Quattrocento nelle testimonianze coeve, Florence, 1988, p. 187). 83 See Gilbert, Italian Art 1400-1500, p. 164. That Bruni did, in fact, "get together" with Donatello in the interpretation and signifi- cance of his figures, has been suggested by Patricia Leach in her Images of Political Triumph: Donatello's Iconography of Heroes, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1986. She suggests that Bruni supplied the exhor- tatory inscription appended to Donatello's marble David when it was moved to the Palazzo Vecchio in 1416 (pp. 101-03). She also sug- gests that Bruni's "civic humanism" lies behind the complex image of the bronze David now in the Bargello, although, in the end, she says, "Donatello, with a little help from his humanist friends, probably contrived the iconography of the David himself" (p. 135). She argues that the bronze David combines aspects of classical Mercury figures with those of the Old Testament David, and she dates the work, plau- sibly, to 1428-30. She also points to connections, similar to those I have suggested, to Alberti's de Statua. 84 See Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, Bk. III, para. 61, pp. 102-05. 85 See Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, Bk. II, para. 25, pp. 60-61. Here Alberti is quoting from Quintilian's, Institutio Oratoria (Bk. X1I.10.9.). (See H. E. Butler, The 'Institutio Oratoria'of Quintilian, London, 1961, vol. IV, pp. 152-55, and H. S. Jones, Select Passages from Ancient Writers illustrative of the History of Greek Sculpture, London, 1895, p. 93. Here the reference is given incorrectly as Bk. X.) Alberti has added a weight of certainty to Quintilian's more tentative remark. Phidias's reputation for being able to portray the gods is underlined in Quintilian's next sentence, "So much did the majesty of the work give an equivalent of the god" (adeo maiestas operis deum aequavit). 86 See Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, para. 5, pp. 122-23. For Alberti's choice of Caesar and Cato to make his point, see Brunetto Latini, Li Livres dou Tresor, ed. F Carmody, Berkeley, 1948, pp. 344 ff., where they are cited as exemplars of rhetoric in action. 87 The term, "praxis", which can be roughly translated, "action," is used by Aristotle in the Poetics in conjunction with the terms ethos and pathos to denote what happens as a result of play of these two, either as plot in a narrative or as energy on the part of an individual. (See Butcher, Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, 1447a 26-28 and 1449b 24-1450b 4, pp. 8-9 and pp. 22-29.) 88 Besides citing Phidias as an exemplar in de Pictura (see above note 85), Alberti also cites him exclusively in de Statua. His sources for this are varied, but he views him as the sculptor who was able to achieve the balance of ethos and pathos in his figures that true mi- mesis demanded. According to Alberti, Phidias's sculptures could be tested for the efficacy of his own technical method either in the way their basic dimensions conformed to the exempeda and "mov- able squares," to give the ethos of the figure (Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, para. 5, pp. 122-25 and para. 11, pp. 132-33), or in the dimensions of movement exemplified in the use of the finitorium, to give the pathos (Alberti, On Painting and Sculpture, para. 9, pp. 130- 31). For the latter, Alberti chose one of the "Horse Tamers" on the Quirinal which he saw in Rome. These two statues, which are Roman copies of Greek originals, bore inscriptions in Alberti's day, probably dating from the 4th C., identifying them as being by Phidias and Praxiteles. There is a difference between them in the treatment of anatomy and movement, so that the one said to be by Phidias shows a more fluid and natural treatment of the musculature and the pose, making the action more vital (see P P Bober and R. O. Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists and Antique Sculpture, Oxford, 1986, pp. 159- 61, and plates 125 etc.). Alberti may well have observed this and have linked it to what he knew of Phidias's reputation from written sources. 140</page></plain_text>
