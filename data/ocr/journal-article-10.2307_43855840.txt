Frangipane* Abstract: The paper presents the main results obtained in the recent excavation of the early 3rd millennium levels at Arslantepe- Malatya , which reveal substantial changes following the collapse of the Late Chalcolithic centralised system in connection with the establishment of new groups linked to the Kura-Araxes culture. The new data show that these early 3rd millennium settlements , besides marking a break with respect to the earlier Chalcolithic period and a radically new organisation, interestingly also show more elements of continuity than previously thought in the maintenance of a central role for Arslantepe in the Malatya region and in the continuation of some traditions such as those related to metallurgy. Rather than a momentary intrusion of pastoral communities of Transcaucasian origin , the new picture suggests the temporary appropriation of the site by mobile, probably transhumant groups moving in a wide area around the plain and already well-rooted in the region; after the destruction of the 4th millennium palace, they used Arslantepe as their power centre and landmark , probably competing with the local rural population for the control of the site and the region. Résumé : Cet article présente les principaux résultats obtenus lors de la fouille menée récemment sur des niveaux du début du 3e millénaire à Arslantepe-Malatya, niveaux qui ont révélé de profonds changements après l'effondrement du système centralisé du Chalcolithique récent, en connexion avec l'installation sur le site de nouveaux groupes de population liés à la culture Kura-Araxe. Outre le fait qu'elles marquent une rupture par rapport au Chalcolithique et témoignent d'une organisation radicalement nouvelle, les données récentes montrent que ces occupations du début du 3e millénaire présentent aussi plus d'éléments de continuité qu'on ne le pensait auparavant dans le maintien du rôle central d' Arslantepe dans la région de Malatya et dans la poursuite de certaines traditions comme celles liées à la métallurgie. L'image qui se dessine maintenant suggère l'appropriation temporaire du site par des groupes mobiles, probablement transhumants, se déplaçant sur un large territoire autour de la plaine [ de Malatya ] et déjà bien implantés dans cette région, plus qu'une intrusion passagère de communautés pastorales venues de Transcaucasie. Après la destruction du palais du 4e millénaire, ces groupes mobiles ont utilisé Arslantepe comme le centre et le marqueur territorial de leur pouvoir, probablement en conflit avec la population rurale locale pour le contrôle du site et de la région.

Frangipane ARSLANTEPE AS A FRONTIER CENTRE: THE COMPLEX NETWORK OF INTER-ANATOLIAN CONNECTIONS IN THE 4th - EARLY 3RD MILLENNIA BC. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS It is now an established fact that in the 4th millennium Arslantepe became a very powerful political and economic centre with the ability to control the Malatya plain and almost certainly to interact from a dominant position with the neighbouring regions and populations. Like the other north- ern 'early state' centres on the periphery of Mesopotamia, Arslantepe had a system for centralising power and controlling the primary economy, for the administrative management of centralised activities, for the ideological/religious mediation, as well as formal and symbolic choices, that were certainly linked to the Mesopotamian world and Uruk culture-bearing communities. The relations of Arslantepe - and the northern centres in general - with the southern societies have always been considered prominent, and the debate has always focused on the nature of these relations, on the degree of influence the southern societies exercised over the development of the local communities, on the identity of the southern 'counterparty': whether they were southern communities pushing northwards in search of raw materials, or 'groups of settlers' which had settled in the north for a variety of reasons, or the same societ- ies of Upper Mesopotamia who had been hybridised by this contact (Rothman 2001). There is no doubt that during the second half of the 4th millen- nium there was a great deal of interaction between Arslantepe and the Uruk environment, and that this led to changes in the tastes and customs of the population, or at least of their rul- ing classes, and quite probably led to a further development of the economic centralisation system and an enhancement in the power of the local elites. It is, however, quite evident that this contact never really interfered in the system of governance of the Arslantepe elites, in the management of their central activi- ties and in the specific features of their internal and external relations. In period VIA (Late Chalcolithic 5), even though Arslantepe participated in the growth of the centralised and redistribution systems that were typical of the Mesopotamian world in the broad sense of the term, it nevertheless exhibited many features of its own which are evidence of the peculiarity of its autonomous development. This is also confirmed by the fact that the origins of this process can be found in the previous period VII (LC3-4), when there was no indication of any direct contacts with the southern communities (Frangipane 2003 and 2012a; D'Anna, Guarino 2010). As I have stated on many occasions, the most important feature that distinguished Arslantepe from the Mesopotamian world was the absence of urbanisation in the full sense of the term, since Arslantepe did not attract populations to settle on the site but, at the height of its power, it actually shrank in size, becoming a kind of political/administrative/ceremonial centre serving a population that was probably scattered throughout the plain (Frangipane, Di Nocera 2012). The second distinc- tive feature of this site was the early secularisation of its power system, which, as in Mesopotamia, had originally been based on ideological/religious mediation (period VII), and, at the end of the 4th millennium (period VIA), was exercised in a huge unitary architectural complex with specific areas set aside for a variety of different functions, from storage to food redistri- bution, to administrative activities, to ceremonial and recep- tion practices, and perhaps to the 'chiefs' residence. The new finding, in 2012-2013, of a monumental building with a main hall (A1358) communicating with both the public area and the assumed elite residences, on the top of the mound, does sug- gest the possibility that the entire VIA architectural complex was a unitary large assemblage including a residential sector. Therefore, such a complex could be defined, in my opinion, as, at least, a 'proto -palace' (Frangipane 1997 and 2012a; Frangipane ed. 2010). 1 One of the elements pointing to the high degree of auton- omy enjoyed by Arslantepe society and its rulers in the 4th millennium is their ability to establish various and differently oriented relations, reaching, beside their 'Mesopotamian' neighbours, the northern Anatolian groups in the mountains overlooking the Upper Euphrates Valley to the north, and, in this particular phase, looking towards the north west. A clear indication of the relations established with central-northern Anatolian communities comes from the fact that the pottery repertoire of the Late Uruk period in Arslantepe VIA includes a number of classes of Red-Black Ware, very closely resem- bling those found at Alitar, Alaca, Çadir Höyük and other Central Anatolian sites (Palmieri 1973: 165-171; Palumbi 2008a; Çaliçkan Akgíil 2012 and 2013). Interestingly, simi- lar evidence has also been found at the neighbouring site of Tepecik, in the Altinova valley, where Red-Black Ware found 1. The definition of a 'palace' as a residence of a royal personage is based on the observation of the well-known Early Dynastic examples, which were however also places for performing political and economic transactions. The findings at Arslantepe show, in my opinion, a greater complexity and variety of forms and functions in the 'seats of power' in the formative era, which reflect different types and nature of hierarchical relationships and various modes of institutionalising authority, before a mature and effective State system was established. This stresses the necessity of reconsidering concepts and definitions in order to better understand formative societies.

New data 171 in the Late Uruk levels shows even more numerous and pre- cise similarities with Central Anatolian materials (Esin 1982; Çaliçkan Akgiil 2013). We have no clear knowledge of the nature, reasons for or precise dynamics of these relations, but we may assume that the populations involved were pastoralists, nomadic or transhumant herders who took their flocks along these mountain chains, prob- ably attracted towards the Euphrates Valley by the new potential for disposing of their products, precisely because of the increased demand from such centres as Arslantepe (Palumbi 2010 and 2012). These populations must have comprised a mosaic of dif- ferent groups sharing similar lifestyles and frequenting the same areas, such as the Euphrates Valley or some of the mountain regions rich in metal ores surrounding the southern and south- eastern shores of the Black Sea. Even though the data we have today are not sufficient to prove these assumptions, it is only by suggesting a mosaic of various differing mobile groups of this kind, moving out in different directions through the same ter- ritories and interacting each other and with the sedentary popu- lations they met, probably having the northernmost part of the Euphrates Valley as one of their meeting places, that we may account for what took place at Arslantepe and throughout its region between the 4th and the 3rd millennia. It was here, indeed, that, on the one hand, the evident influence of central Anatolian cultures dominating in the Late Chalcolithic gave way to the prevalence of eastern Anatolian/Transcaucasian components at the beginning of the 3rd millennium; and on the other hand, as Giulio Palumbi has clearly shown, the material culture of these new pastoralist groups that settled at Arslantepe following the destruction of the 4th millennium palace and the collapse of the Mesopotamian-type centralised system retained elements exhibiting strong hybridisation with the earlier Central Anatolian traditions (Palumbi 2008b; 2010 and 2012). The main features of, and production technologies used for Red-Black Ware significantly spread throughout the vast area ranging from North-Central Anatolia to the areas south of the Caucasus in the course of the second half of the 4th millen- nium, differing in terms of repertoires, profiles and specific traits from one area to another, while it was precisely in the northernmost part of the Upper Euphrates Valley that tech- niques and aesthetic features of Central Anatolian origin melded with shapes and repertoires from the Kura-Araxes tradition (Palumbi 2008b and 2012). Interactions between the different pastoral components moving in different directions along the northern mountainous range may also have involved the eastern groups belonging to the early Kura-Araxes culture already in the 4th millennium, even though the latter were not yet the political players in the Upper Euphrates Valley that would subsequently become, with the result that they were not yet archaeologically visible there. The procurement of metal may well have been one of the rea- sons for the relations created between the nomadic groups and the emerging power centres, because it was precisely in the sec- ond half of the 4th millennium that metal production developed enormously both at Arslantepe and in many of these northern areas. All the mountain regions along the southern and south- eastern shores of the Black Sea and as far as the Caucasian and Transcaucasian zones were in fact rich in poly-metallic deposits containing copper, arsenic and such elements as nickel and anti- mony which are frequently present in the metal objects from this period in several areas with Red-Black ware cultures, and beyond: from the northern coast of Central Anatolia (Özbal et al. 2002; Yalçin 2008), to the Transcaucasian areas (Kushnareva, Chubinishvili 1970: 130-133; Courcier 2010; Hansen et al. 2010), to the Upper and Middle Euphrates Valley, where links with the northern mountainous regions in metal composition are well shown at Arslantepe (Palmieri et al. 1999; Hauptmann et al. 2002), Hassek Höyük (Schmidt-Strecker et al. 1992), and Hacinebi (Özbal et al. 2000). This comparatively uniform composition of the metals, pre- sumably due to the fact that similar materials as well as similar technologies were used to produce them, is also matched by the widespread use of similar types of artefacts, particularly orna- mental objects and certain classes of weaponry. All this sug- gests that the itinerant pastoralists groups bearing Red-Black Ware probably supplied the sedentary populations and their main centres, together with by-products of pastoralism, with metals and/or technologies for producing them. At all events, there would not be anything anomalous and strange about such a correlation between pastoralism, nomadism and metallurgy, well attested in various archaeological and ethnographical examples. Evidence for this reconstruction can, in my opinion, be found in the data recently unearthed at Arslantepe. ABRUPT CHANGES AT ARSLANTEPE AT THE DAWN OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM: THE NEW SHORT-LIVED OCCUPATIONS IN PERIOD VIB1 By the early 1980s it had become clear that the col- lapse and destruction of the period VIA (LC5) monumen- tal public complex had been followed by a period of radical changes when the site was occupied by itinerant groups with Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 169-182 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="4">172 M. FRANGIPANE links to Transcaucasian cultures, who, ca 3000 BC, settled in their wooden wattle and daub huts on the ruins of the palace (Frangipane, Palmieri 1983). These groups used a new kind of handmade red-black burnished pottery that was quite different from the region's traditional Chalcolithic ware. Gone forever seemed to be the mud brick architecture, the wheel-made pot- tery, cretulae and mass-produced bowls, any evidence of cen- tralised power and of relations with the Mesopotamian world. There were several successive levels of occupation of this kind, all fairly similar in terms of the scattered distribution of the huts, the presence of large open areas covered with a thin layers of dark organic matter, and numerous postholes, placed either haphazardly or laid out in long rows, probably the remains of fences for stabling purposes (Frangipane 2012b; Palumbi 2012). It was only in the most recent of these levels that mud brick reappeared, with one particular building made of long rectan- gular rooms arranged lengthwise and the walls reinforced by small external buttresses (Frangipane, Palmieri 1983: Fig. 2; Palumbi 2012: Fig. 2a). This building was isolated from the rest, and had been built towards the south, near the edge of the settlement, almost as if to act as a kind of border. In this last phase there seems to have been fewer huts, and a large open space in which a large vaulted oven was found, probably for collective cooking purposes. In more recent years, as the excavations have expanded, the materials more closely studied and the stratigraphie settlement phases in this period analysed in details, it has become possible to offer a more focused definition of the features of this occupa- tion and its internal sequence, made up of periodic successive short-lived settlements, perhaps seasonal in character,2 and to establish a specific cultural identity for these groups. Palumbi has highlighted interesting links in the material culture of these communities with the local Malatya plain traditions in terms of some of their domestic equipment (the continuing use of the traditional omphalos- shaped Chalcolithic fireplaces (figs. 1 and 5a) instead of the portable hearths widely used by the north- eastern Anatolian and Transcaucasian communities), and some of the technological and aesthetic features of their red-black ware referring to the central Anatolian tradition that was evi- denced in the site in the Late Chalcolithic3 (Palumbi 2008b; 2010 and 2012). As already suggested, this tradition was per- haps also introduced by other itinerant pastoralist components 2. This work is currently being prepared for its final publication. 3. The red-black wares of both periods were almost identical in terms of sur- face treatment, the general two-colour aspect, the deliberate use of black for the inside of the open vessels and the outside of the closed shapes respectively (Palumbi 2008b), which was also a typical feature of central Anatolian productions (Çali§kan Akglil 2013). who must have frequented the Malatya plain in the 4th millen- nium, and, although less visible, may have played quite a con- siderable part in the life and the economic system of Arslantepe in period VIA, as could be indicated, among other things, by the extraordinary rise in sheep-raising in comparison with the pre- vious period VII (Bökönyi 1983; Bartosiewicz 2010). This not only points to specialised pastoralist activities, but might also indicate the possible involvement of transhumant or nomadic pastoralists in the political economy of the central institutions (Frangipane 2010; Palumbi 2010 and 2012). The persistence of local features already present in the Malatya plain in Late Chalcolithic and the links with the ceramic tradition of central Anatolian origin, together with the overall differences between the Arslantepe VIB1 huts and the typical Transcaucasian and north-eastern Anatolian models, as Palumbi has stated, suggest that the groups who settled in the site at the dawn of the 3rd millennium had a more local identity, rather than belonging fully to the Kura- Araxes world, as initially thought. Nevertheless, the striking overall similarity between the VIB1 ceramic assemblage and the Kura- Araxes pottery, the use of timber and the wattle-and-daub technique for the con- struction of their huts, their transhumant way of life and the general behaviour of these groups, constitute indisputable proof of their close linkage and relationship with the groups belong- ing to that culture. What is moreover interesting, in this regard, is the fact that the Kura-Araxes groups appear, in this period, to have been expanding towards the western and southern regions where the 'Late Uruk' centres had previously flourished and where they would be making their presence increasingly felt throughout the 3rd millennium. The Upper Euphrates Valley must, once again, have become a crossroads and a place where different communities would meet and clash, driven to inten- sify their relations and then compete, due perhaps precisely to the development of those political and economic centres that were a focus of attraction in the Late Chalcolithic and subse- quently became the object of destructive appetites. The evidence at Arslantepe clearly documents the alternat- ing dominance of different communities - nomadic pastoral- ists or sedentary farmers - and the high level of conflict and instability, which characterised the early centuries of the 3rd millennium in the Malatya plain and probably throughout the whole of the Upper Euphrates Valley. This certainly had a great deal to do with both the 'expansion' of the Kura-Araxes communities and related groups, and the internal crisis which lead to the disintegration of the powerful centralised system of governance of the Late Chalcolithic 5 (LC5). This collapse indeed created both a power vacuum and an extremely attrac- tive legacy just waiting to be seized.

New data 173 Recent discoveries on the site provide extraordinary doc- umentation of this phase of instability and the radical trans- formation through which the new pastoralist communities became the leading players in the new scenery. NEW FINDINGS AND A NEW PICTURE OF THE EARLY THIRD MILLENNIUM COMMUNITIES IN THE MALATYA PLAIN Excavations carried out during the last three campaigns at Arslantepe have brought to light new and wholly unexpected structures on the top of the mound revealing the existence, in period VIB1, of a settlement which, while certainly occupied on a seasonal and non-permanent basis, was much more substantial and important than had previously been thought. At the begin- ning of the 3rd millennium, following the destruction of the pal- ace and the final collapse of the powerful system of political and economic centralisation characteristic of the 4th millennium, Arslantepe was not an abandoned site that was only occasionally frequented by transhumant communities, but, on the contrary, the evidence shows that it retained, or rather re-acquired, a cen- tral role in the region, perhaps becoming the seat for the chiefs of these itinerant groups, where they performed activities of common interest and exercised political coordination functions. The first novelty unearthed in 2011 was the finding of a single hut much larger than all the others standing on the highest part of the mound, in the middle of a broad mud-plas- tered area boarded to the south by a robust palisade, which had been rebuilt and reinforced several times (Frangipane 2012b) (figs. 1 and 4). The hut had been also rebuilt or modi- fied at least three times and always on the same spot, with changes in the floor plan, and seems to have continued in use throughout all, or almost the whole of period VIB1.4 The pal- isade, whose posts had been sunk into the ground to a depth of nearly one metre, differed from the other rows of posts uncovered in the VIB1 settlement for its solidity and long duration: it consisted of more than one rows of posts with double-buttressed reinforcements, on the inside and outside, at regular 2-3 metre intervals (fig. 2), and appears to have been in use for a very long time. In its first phase, the hut consisted of three rooms in a row and was bordered to the east by another small room, or an 4. At least five building levels relating to this period have been identified so far. Fig. 1 - Arslantepe , Period VIB1 (3000-2900 BC).

In the later phases, the hut took on a quadrangular shape, but remained large and isolated (fig. 4). In the open area between the hut and the palisade, in all of the phases (figs. 2 and 4: A1364 and A1327), there were hundreds of animal bones, mostly of sheep and goats, all of them choicest parts of the animal, which seem to have been the remains of collective meals that had been dumped in front of the large hut (Siracusano, Bartosiewicz 2012). The archaeo- zoologists, noting the difference in this bone assemblage from the usual pattern observed in the remains of meals in the rest of the settlement, as well as the strange dispersion of the bones in the environment rather than their discarding in pits or other places set aside for waste disposal, have correctly suggested that these remains were probably the leftovers of feasting or Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 169-182 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="6">174 M.

New data 175 Fig. 5 - Arslantepe, Period VIBL Building 36 and the large room Al 000 ( photo Roberto Cecacci). But the most important discovery, which was totally unex- pected in this settlement and cultural environment, was an imposing mud brick building (Building 36) with walls at least 1 m thick resting on stone foundations, built against the south- ern side of the palisade (figs. 1, 4, 5b).5 The most representa- tive part of the building was a long rectangular room (A 1000) with a large central circular hearth in the middle, whose only difference from the traditional hearth types commonly used at Arslantepe was its much larger size. Room A 1000 opened out southwards, namely towards the peripheral part of the settlement, with two entrances on either side of a small cen- tral protruding room, flanked by buttresses on the other sides, as if to create a kind of invitation to enter and emphasise the 'sumptuous' character of the building.

It is not clear whether Building 36 was built at the same time as the pali- sade (although I believe this to be the most likely explanation) or immedi- ately before it. more similar to the other rows of posts found in the rest of the settlement, also bordered the eastern side of the building, per- haps from the time of its original construction, creating around it a sort of distinct area. In front of the building, to the south, there were no huts, but a vast open area marked by post holes, which were more clearly visible in the later phases, perhaps because of the repeated reconstruction of roofs or fencing or other minor structures. Building 36, which was certainly not a house, had also been used for a very long time and had been rebuilt several times, particularly as for the entrances and the external areas in its immediate proximity. The most significant change however took place between the earliest phase of its construction (VTB1- Phase 2), in which only room A1000 had been built (fig. 1), and the later phases (VIBl-Phases 3 and 4), when another room had been added to the east (A1369), also using mud brick and stone foundations, albeit less sturdy than in the long room walls. This room communicated with A1000 through a door and was used as a store-room (figs. 4 and 5b). It is interesting to note that in the first phase, in the area that would subse- quently become storeroom A 1369, there was a concentration of small pits, all the same size, which may have been used for storing food (fig. 1). If this interpretation is correct,6 it could show that there was a certain continuity in the use of spaces and in the function of the building, albeit with considerable architectural modifications. In addition to the little pits, two buried rectangular struc- tures also belonging to the earliest phase (A1350 and A1391) have been brought to light to the north of the building and the palisade, in the area of the large hut. These two structures, which are identical, had been sunk to a considerable depth, disturbing the underlying period VIA levels, and had been isolated by covering their walls with mud bricks, while the unplastered floors were covered with thin straw mats. Nothing was found inside these structures and it is possible that they were underground storage cellars for keeping perishable food- stuffs (not in pots and not grains) in a cool and dark place, dairy products (?). In the later phase of Building 36, room A1369 and the small room A 1374, which opened directly into the large hall, both contained huge quantities of broken vessels and other materials on the floor in addition to numerous charred wooden beams that had fallen from the roof (fig. 6); collapsed beams were also present in considerable quantities and in an excellent 6. The pits were no longer in their original state because of the disturbance caused by the later construction of room A 1369 and the related grading work.

The very numerous jars found in situ on the floors of these two storerooms were of various sizes and the vast majority of them belonged to the classical repertoire of the Kura-Araxes- like hand-made Red-Black Ware of Arslantepe period VIB1 (fig. 7e). We do not yet know what these vases contained, but in a corner of room A1369, a group of small charred fruits, which have been preliminarily identified as sorb-apples,7 were found close to some of these broken jars.

Laura Sadori and Alessia Masi, personal comm. from the materials found in ordinary huts. Within the category of handmade dark pottery, two unusual narrow-necked bottles were found in the large store room A1369 (fig. 7c), whereas a very peculiar double spouted and interiorly bipartite small jar (fig. 7b) comes from the smaller store A1374, together with two decorated pots (fig. 7a and d), hitherto all unique examples in the Arslantepe VIB1 repertoire. These latter items were a large jar of brown ware with an engraved decoration at the joint between the neck and the shoulder, and a very well bur- nished small jar of red-black ware bearing two elegant relief decorations, probably stylised zoomorphic motifs (a snake and frontal depiction of horns), on either side of the body. The general reference to the Kura-Araxes world is also evident in these special pottery examples, but once again that cultural environment only seems to have been a source of inspi- ration, here adapted to the characteristics and the taste of the local ware. Decorated pottery, both engraved and in relief, would become more frequent in later times in Transcaucasia, but one can already find this kind of ware from the Early Bronze Age, particularly in North East Anatolia and Georgia: Karaz, Pulur, Güzelova (Içikli 2011), Khizanaant Gora, Kiketi, Shamshvilde, Amiranis Gora, Baba Dervish (Kushnareva, Chubinishvili 1970: Fig. 44: 11, 37; Kushnareva 1993; Kiguradze, Sagona 2003). Alongside these particular vessels, which however belon- ged, in general terms, to the most common pottery classes in period VIB1, there was also a significant presence (albeit with only few examples) of wheel-made light-coloured vessels in the Uruk tradition, which was almost totally absent elsewhere in the settlement (fig. 8). Two wheel-made necked jars with reserved slip decoration were standing out among the small amounts of pottery found in the main room A1000, while a single wheel-made bowl with triangular protruding rim was found in storeroom A 1369 (fig. 8b-c). Of particular interest is the fact that a wheel-made small jar with a pronounced cari- nated shoulder had also been found in the small room adjacent to the large hut (A 1348) in its first building phase (fig. 8a). The presence of wheel-made pottery in the prominent structures on the top of the mound is probably evidence of an interesting relationship established by the VIB1 pastoral groups with the post-Uruk sedentary population in the same Malatya plain and in the Euphrates Valley as a whole, which must have taken shape in activities or meetings held in the 'public' building (Building 36) and in the area of the 'chief's huť. Here, two seals were also found, one terracotta cylinder seal and one stone stamp-seal, which are unique findings in period VIB1 (Frangipane 2012b) (fig. 9). Building 36 stands apart not only because of the evidence it provides of contacts with the post-Uruk communities Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 169-182 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="9">After collapse: Continuity and Disruption in the settlement by Kura-Araxes-linked pastoral groups at Arslantepe-Malatya (Turkey).

Cecacci). present in the region, for the large storage areas and the peculiar features of some ceramic materials, but also for the presence of various beautiful metal objects reveal- ing the sophisticated metallurgy practised by these groups (fig. 10). Among these objects, there were two superb copper butted spearheads found in room A1369 (fig. lOd), which are practically identical, albeit smaller, to both the spears found in the period VIA palace (fig. lOf) and those from the so- called "Royal Tomb" (fig. 10e). A group of copper rings made of metal sheet with one, two or three rivets were found in the other storeroom A1374 (fig. 10a); they must have originally been attached to some wooden object and may have been used to fasten the handle of tools or perhaps even the shafts of the spears on their butt. In addition to the more usual awls and chisels, the other interesting copper artefact in terms of its comparisons with similar objects found in the Arslantepe "Royal Tomb" and in the Southern Caucasus metallurgical assemblages is a frag- mentary double spiral pin, also found, as the spearheads, in storeroom A1369 (fig. 10c). Another particular metal object, which, as far as I know, is unique of its kind, is a sort of lead medallion, with one side decorated with a chiselled engraving and a hole for hanging it, found in the final construction phase of Building 36 (fig. 10b). Another noteworthy discovery in the adjacent area south- east of Building 36 was an open area containing a shallow basin with a wood-clad bottom, and two run-off inlets, at the side of which was a hut (A789) containing six unusual and very peculiar spouted small jars with two pedestals in the shape of a human foot (fig. 11) (Frangipane 2012b: Fig. 3b-c). It is pos- sible that this area had been used for performing ceremonial practices of some kind (perhaps ritual animal slaughter8 and libations?). We cannot say with any certainty that the large hut on the top of the mound had been built at the very beginning of VIB1 occupation, even though in the earliest phase it lay directly on the ruins of a large hall (also recently found) belonging to the 4th millennium palace complex. Being built on the top of the tell, the surface grading work for the construction of the hut may have indeed removed any unsubstantial traces of an ear- lier occupation. But we have the proof that Building 36 was built some time after the beginning of VIB1 occupation, evi- denced by the fact that it stood on earlier levels of this period comprising only wide open areas paved with mud and covered with thin layers of dark organic matter. This sequence shows that it took some time before the nomadic pastoralist commu- nities were able to re-appropriate the site as their own power centre. 8. The wooden cladding on the bottom of the basin resembles similar clad- ding found on a run-off channel adjacent to a slaughter area in the later period VIB2 village. This suggests that there may have been a possible linkage between this type of wooden cladding and blood disposal.

THE "ROYAL TOMB" AND THE EARLY THIRD MILLENNIUM PASTORALIST OCCUPATIONS AT ARSLANTEPE The upper area of the settlement on the whole, and in par- ticular Building 36, are marked out by the presence of special structures and objects, some of which have never been found anywhere else in the settlement and are also without compari- son in any other regions of the Kura-Araxes world. The major- ity of the materials found there nevertheless continue to exhibit links with traditional artefacts typical of the Transcaucasian region, and of Georgia in particular. More specifically, the metals found in Building 36 belong to a well-known Kura-Araxes repertoire (Kushnareva, Chu- binishvili 1970: Figs. 42-43; Kushnareva 1993: 81-82; Sagona 2004: Figs. 14-15; Courcier 2010: Fig. 9; Hauptmann et al. 2010) and, as far as the spears are concerned, also reveal links ranging beyond the Caucasus (Courcier 2010: Fig. 5). The most interesting aspect, however, is that these metals are very close to the other metallurgical findings of the end of the 4th and beginning of the 3rd millennia at Arslantepe, found both in the period VIA palace (Frangipane, Palmieri 1983) and, to an even greater extent, in the "Royal Tomb" (Frangipane et al. 2001; Di Nocera 2010). The spears are identical in type to those found in both contexts, while the double-spiral pin is identical to one of the copper pins associated with the individ- uals sacrificed on the slab of the cist grave in the Tomb. Even though these period VIB1 metals have not yet been analysed, the fact that the composition of the metals found in the palace is very similar to that of the more recent objects found in the burial (Hauptmann et al. 2002) suggests that the technology Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 169-182 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="12">180 M. FRANGIPANE and the raw materials used throughout these periods were not dissimilar. The close connection between the metallurgy of the pal- ace and the one following its collapse at Arslantepe, together with the similarities already mentioned with the metallurgy of the southern/south-eastern Pontus belt and South Caucasus regions, suggest that it may have been the transhumant pasto- ralist groups, who, moving around in the area and establishing relations with the sedentary populations in the Upper Euphrates valleys and their elites as early as the mid-4th millennium, brought with them the metal which was so plentiful in the regions they frequented. And together with these supplies, they must also have helped to disseminate a sophisticated metallur- gical technology, which they had probably developed precisely as a result of the increased demand for metal from the early proto-state centres and societies in the northern Euphrates region. There is in fact clear evidence that the development of metallurgy in Anatolia was a local process both in terms of its production and use (Lehner and Yener 2014). These itin- erant groups, settled at Arslantepe on the ruins of the palace at the beginning of the 3rd millennium, may have contended the domination of the site and the territory to the rural popu- lations in the plain, as evidenced from the alternation, in the stratigraphie sequence of Arslantepe, of Kura-Araxes linked groups (period VIB1) and post-Uruk cultures (period VIB2) characterizing the EBI developments in the Upper and Middle Euphrates Valley (Frangipane 2012b). There are close links between the materials found in Building 36 and those in the "Royal Tomb", in terms not only of the metal objects but also the pottery - in both cases exhibiting a number of archaic features, particularly as for the large wheel- made jars which very closely resemble the profile of those found in the palace, and in both cases combining Red-Black Ware linked to Kura-Araxes environment and wheel-made pottery in the Late Uruk tradition. These comparisons raise a number of questions regarding the dating of the tomb. For its original stratigraphie relationship was uncertain because the mouth of the burial pit had been removed from the construction of Early Bronze III settlements, though we can state that the structure certainly post-dated the earliest levels of the period VIB1 occu- pation into which it had been hewn (Frangipane et al. 2001). In the light of the recent findings, the "Royal Tomb" may perhaps be dated either to the same period as Building 36, or the transition to period VIB2, when an enormous defence wall had been built over the ruins of Building 36 and over the palisade, following its contours, and surrounding the topmost part of the mound. This wall was only linked on both the out- side and the inside with wide-open areas paved with mud and showing numerous post-holes (Frangipane 2012b: Fig. 6). In case the tomb belonged to this phase, it would therefore have been an extra moenia burial. The monumental character, the importance and the uniqueness of this special burial would indeed certainly not have been consistent with the existence of the later period VIB2 village adjacent to, or only a short distance from it. The burial must have been built to stand out, clearly visible and in isolation, on the edge of the settlement and at a certain distance away from every building. If this chronological interpretation is correct (and the 14C date obtained for the tomb is well in keeping with this hypothesis)9, the high status person buried in the tomb may have had links to the pastoralist elites of period VIB1 or the transition to period VIB2. SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS The data obtained from the latest excavation campaigns at Arslantepe have revealed a far longer continuity than had previously been thought in the development of the events that characterised the end of the 4th and first quarter of the 3rd millennia on the site. This, in my opinion, was also due to the consolidation of relations that had previously been estab- lished by the 4th millennium elites with the itinerant pastoral- ist communities from the mountains north of the Euphrates Valley. The settlement of the Kura-Araxes-linked pastoral- ists following the collapse of the palace system would not have been a sporadic episode but would certainly have fol- lowed a period in which they had previously frequented the region and had already established mutual relations with the sedentary populations in the valley, and perhaps with other (more western?) pastoralist groups which also frequented the region. I believe that it was precisely this consolidation of their rela- tions with the local communities that made these mobile groups an active component perhaps contributing to the same collapse of the 4th millennium centralised system and certainly influenc- ing the subsequent history of the region: while their role and their previous relations paved the way for them to 'expand' once the central control exercised by the palace elites had collapsed, this new leadership role over the area also imposed new lifestyles and a new social organisation, causing serious disruption to the previous political, social and economic system and leading to 9. The AMS dating obtained in the Uppsala Laboratory, when calibrated, ranges between 3080 and 2900 BCE (Frangipane et al. 2001: 135).

New data 181 the establishment of a new type of society. It is also possible that the takeover by these groups of the domination of the site and the surrounding territory from highly structured and powerful elites fostered the consolidation of their own hierarchies. The presence of a large communal or public building (Building 36) and an extremely richly-endowed elite burial are signs of the hierarchical structures that these pastoralists communities had now assumed and show their appropriation of Arslantepe as a political centre, perhaps a landmark for the nomadic populations in the zone. On the other hand, the con- struction of the large fortification wall on the top of the mound at the end of this period emphasises the high degree of insta- bility at the time, and, in the absence of any powerful central control, the complexity of the relations established between differing social, cultural and probably also ethnic, groups that, at least partially, coexisted in the Malatya plain and more gen- erally in the Upper Euphrates Valley. The continuing and suc- cessive destructions of the various Early Bronze I settlements at Arslantepe and the final break in the traditional cultural and political relations of the Malatya plain at the beginning of Early Bronze II stand as evidence of this instability and highlight the devastating effects of the hypothesised struggles characterising the first two centuries of the 3rd millennium. The influence from north-east Anatolian and Transcaucasian regions however continued to be felt, though in a different way, along the entire 3rd millennium.
