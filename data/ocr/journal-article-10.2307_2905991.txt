<plain_text><page sequence="1">Franz Borkenau, End and Beginning: On the Generations of Cultures and the Origins of the West, ed. Richard Lowenthal New York: Columbia U.P. 1981. 493 pages By any standards Franz Borkenau was an unusual character. The part- Jewish scion of Viennese bourgeoisie had received a strict Jesuitic up- bringing, he engaged in Communist activities during his doctoral studies at the University of Leipzig, and soon became a leader of the Communist students in Germany and (secretly) a senior researcher for the Communist International. Equally soon he became disenchanted; by 1929 when Stalin started the offensive against the Social Democrats, the campaign for ag- ricultural collectivization and the harrassment of Bukharin, Borkenau left the Party. For a while he was associated with the Frankfurt Institut fur Sozialforschung, and he also wrote a book on the Spanish Civil War. By the end of the 30's he was through with Marxism also and he became one of the founders of the "Communist studies" branch of political science. He taught briefly at the University of Marburg and edited the jouranl Ost- Probleme, He was one of the first to develop (in a book published in 1938) the concept of "totalitarianism" as one embracing both left and right polit- ical stances, though with the unusual twist of considering that Hitlerite rule was having a "revolutionary" impact on the traditional structures of Ger-</page><page sequence="2">1236 REVIEWS man society. (A concept taken up 40 years later by a number of East European scholars.) But his chief interests in the post-war years (he died in 1957) was speculation on the philosophy of history. Richard Lowenthal, a distinguished political scientist and long-standing personal friend, col- lected the scattered writings and edited them to the extent that he may be considered a co-author. Thus at least 5 of the 20 chapters appear to be condensations of other texts or combined unfinished manuscripts. The plan and the structure belong to Lowenthal entirely, but there is no question that he remained quite faithful to Borkenau's general ideas, as far as they can be now deciphered. These are relatively simple, but courageous. Borkenau thinks that although Spengler is wrong both philosophically and in many details, his work remains a tremendous challenge, a "cyclopean structure" standing like "an unhewn, wildly fissured rock in a flat dessert" (pp. 33-5); his revolutionary basic ideas need only development and further technical correction. Spengler's most valuable concept (one he shared with Toynbee) is that the minimal intelligible units for historical investigation are not nations, or states, or classes, or individuals, but cultures which have their own dynamics, span of life, and internal mechanics. Borkenau was intent on refining and qualifying considerably these ideas, thus becoming to Spengler what Marx had been to Hegel, as it were. He rejected first of all Spengler's view of cultures as monads without windows. (In Spengler's opinion the categories of space and time shape perception so exclusively as to eliminate cultural intercommunication.) Borkenau went farther than even Toynbee who had developed the con- cept of affiliation: he thinks that at its inception a culture may have multi- ple affiliations (p. 507, p. 393) and also that it may be influenced during its development. The second important modification proposed by Borkenau is to regard "high cultures" as a genus the members of which have certain common features and are arranged in a kind of generational succession. The third important qualification is the way in which Borkenau conceives the central bundle of definitions of a culture. He rejects "Spengler's primal symbol, at once mystical and empty" (p. 45) and thinks that the driving force of cultural creation is the need for social coherence; what this means in effect is that Freudian (pp. 409-411) and sociological (Marxist) elements are made good use of as auxiliaries. Also, whereas Spengler thought the deepest and most basic reason for any symbolic creation is fear, Borkenau claims that it is the attempt to come to terms with death. Social coherence is the attempt by society to come to terms with its own conception of death and with the paranoia and guilt feelings prevalent in a pre-cultural stage. Borkenau's most specific concern is, the title shows, the end and the begin- ning of cultures. He frowns upon Spengler's sweeping dismissal of any- thing outside the periods of cultural flowering, and does not accept that the regression into barbarity or into an ahistoric biological existence is ever complete. "Dark Ages" are indeed regressions; they do express ossifica- tion, disintegration and withdrawal, but they also maintain a history of their own and they are important receptacles for creative combination.</page><page sequence="3">M L N 1237 Accordingly, most essays in Borkenau's book deal with intermediate and "dark" ages. One or two are devoted to the beginnings of Greek and Egyptian culture, and a few to the concluding phase of western civilization (that is, to the twentieth century). But the bulk of the book (pp. 141-434) deals with the period A.D. 400-1100, and includes topics such as the be- ginnings of Western Monasticism, the Chanson de Roland and the Nibelungenlied, Pelagius and S. Boniface, the Assunta of San Clemente in Rome and other paintings of the ninth century, or the rise of the I-form of Speech in Scandinavian languages. The range of topics is breathtaking and the dialectic speculation is dazzling, but the scholarly information often recondite and antiquated and the hypotheses are sometimes so eccentric as to seem crackpot. In the end, the results are daring and innovative. Typical examples of Borkenau's procedure are to be found in his treat- ment of Germanic saga. His central thesis is arbitrary and irrelevant: it is that the historical prototype for Siegfried was none other than Arminius. From this point on he seeks to demonstrate that each successive version of the epic was a distortion or hiding of a fresh layer of historical facts- assimilated into the text. The final result was a combination of successive distortions and shifts of guilt (Hagen's prototype was the Meroviangian Clovis, the merger of the Salic and Ripuarian Franks is portrayed in the different marriages, etc.). This is all much too speculative to be ever con- clusively proved or disproved. Yet Borkenau's conclusions are illuminating and full of promise. "Each of the crises in the poem are linked with the crucial guilt of murder among close relatives," yet, "the manifest content of the saga amounted to the ever repeated, all-round denial of the guilt of those involved" (p. 386). This emphasis on primal crime and on the result- ing psychological consequences antedates Girard's theory (to which it is related) by a good 15 or even 20 years. A similar unverifiable hypothesis is advanced about the Chanson de Ro- land. It was allegedly written by a dwarfish knight called Thuroldus (who appears in the Bayeux tapestry) and who first recited it to the Norman knights on the eve of the battle of Hastings to drive home to them the value of discipline. And yet the conclusions are again shrewd and fruitful. The poem, Borkenau contends, should be read as a kind of Cervantine piece, in all its irony towards lonely prowess, but also as an adroit and culturally crucial transfer of values from physical courage to moral integrity (the worth of the individual soul.) Borkenau's felicities are legion. I cannot abstain from mentioning the detailed demonstration of a connection between the emergence of the first-person singular in European languages and the breakdown of the clan system during migratory periods. Or the "rehabilitation" of Paschasius Rodbertus who, in formulating the dogma of eucharistic Transsubstantia- tion, offered a solution to the social and psychological crisis of the emerg- ing Carolingian elites (pp. 406-416). And finally the witty comments on Egyptian religious change: "Ever since mankind began to make this- worldly other-worldly provision against death, absolute death was never</page><page sequence="4">1238 REVIEWS accepted . . . Now immortality becomes a class privilege, and the struggle for the right to a life after death the first demand of the lower strata ... democratic insurgence against the class privileges of immortality occurs a good deal earlier than any corresponding movement for social levelling in the material sphere; the class struggle manifests itself first on the plane of religion" (p. 78). It is obvious that Borkenau is not merely in the tradition of Spengler and Toynbee. He chooses a time-honored mode of intellectual discourse that hails from Vico, Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Herder, but knew its apogee in the age of Guizot and Burckhardt, Michelet and Palacky. It did not disap- pear in the following century, as the names of philosophers of culture such as Huizinga, Ortega, Friedell, Blaga, and Elias indicate. It is philosophy of culture, the discourse that distinguishes Tocqueville from Ranke, for in- stance. Do we need it? For whom is it meant? Scholars may not need it in their specialized examinations, and the general reader will prefer the journalistic essayism of haute vulgarisation. But between these two more remote provinces there is an area of intelligent discussion in which one of the highest forms of intertextuality can unfold. On this territory the knowledge of history, of the arts and of the social sciences can interact. More importantly they can interact in a manner that leaves room for subjectivity. The philosophy of culture is in a sense an anthropomorphic exercise: it imagines that ideas or cultures or styles have an identity and a subconscious, head, legs, muscles, smiles, and tears. This is, I submit, a legitimate critical metaphor-an irrational and artificial device introduced in order to help our computations. Perhaps it will be reduced and elimi- nated leaving us with some rational, harmonious solutions. The philosopher of culture is in another sense the playful poet: he uses aes- thetic devices on brute historical or sociological material, and thus transfig- ures it. The cognitive value of such a procedure must not be underesti- mated. The aphoristic and magical manner of Walter Benjamin and Ernst Junger, the sentimental sociology of John Lukacs, the bold intellectual raids of George Steiner, the fragmentary philosophy of Lichtenberg, Nietzsche, and Cioran is part of this wider class of cultural symp- tomatology. In the end the philosophy of culture and its relatives come forth because they are needed. In the absence of a strong ideology (liberal, or classicist, or Catholic, or Enlightenment, or socialist) pluralism provides its own cures. One of them is a kind of field unification in ever changing shapes, according to playful-rationalist rules, called the philosophy of cul- ture.
