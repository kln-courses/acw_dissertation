The whole chapter is permeated with the expectation of a clash with Russia for the possession of India. In succeed- ing chapters, the past invasions of India and the progress of Russia in Central Asia are rehearsed. Following this review of events, the author attempts to explain the Russian point of view concerning an advance into India, and while he tries to present both sides fairly, the bogy of the advancing enemy is always present. The author describes the theater of operations which includes the lowland of Turan, the Central Asian mountain region and the plain of the Indus; and he describes the paths, railroads and trails intersecting the area, the condition and high water time of the streams and lists the passes into India. Following are chapters on the countries and peoples of this area and a state- ment of the present distribution of the Russian army in Central Asia. The book contains much valuable information. R. M. BROWN. Aspects of Religious Belief in Babylonia and Assyria. By Morris Jastrow, Jr. xxv and 47I pp. Map, 54 ills., chronological lists of the rulers of Babylonia and Assyria, and index. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, I9II. 8x5s. The prime appeal of Dr. Jastrow's book is to the students of comparative religion. Yet it is interesting to see how much of the work bears upon the geography of the Euphrates Valley, an unexpected yet on second thought wholly natural result of the fact that any work of such ripe scholarship must be broad and not narrow, fecund and never jejune. At base, the story of the great gods must be the story of the greater men who believe in them, who, in a broader view, have created them anthropomorphic. Dr. Jastrow has addressed his conclusions to those students who are interested in the study of the growth of the divine idea out of a congeries of village, municipal and racial gods keeping even pace with the growth of the earliest civilization of which we have record. To the furth,erance of his object he draws extensively, always brilliantly, upon the store of literary material which fresh exploration is bringing to light in the Assyrian-Babylonian region and which is daily becoming better interpreted and better comprehended. Equally with divinity is geography revealed in the course of such study, the geography of folk movement and folk settlement. Out of this rich store we have space to note but one instance of this contribu- tion of theology to civic geography. Associated with the temples of the alluvial plain are found tower structures in courses, to which has been assigned the name zikkurats. These towers, the author points out, are the machinery of the worship of the mountain gods, the "high places" of Old Testament heresies, the Jacob's ladder of an earlier myth. Their presence in the plain and in the double delta argue a movement thereunto of settlement of a race of moun- taineers. We need not pursue the intricate yet convincing ingenuity of his argument in the establishment of the home land of this remote migration; it is enough to point out the method whereby the gods are made to trace out the archaic highways long ages after the wind has swept away even the dust by themselves contributed in which these ancient wanderers left their footprints. We note, however, that having served their end in this line of proof the zik- kurats, of which the Babel tower was a type, have survived without meaning in the religious architecture which gives to the mosque its minaret and to the cathedral its twin spires. It is as much pleasure as surprise to find that the cuneiform slabs of the temple records can be read to set forth the geography of Sumer and Akkad. The gods themselves have preserved the ancient land- marks of the time when the world was young. WILLIAM CHURCHILL. 216</page></plain_text>
