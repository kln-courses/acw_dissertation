<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Flamingo Is Born. Max Alfred Zoll. 38pp. $5.95. G.P. Putnam's Sons, 200 Madison Ave., New York 10016. 1978. (Grades P-3) This book is a photographic essay on the fla- mingo, from conception through maturity. The pictures show fertilization and incubation of the egg, hourly development of the newborn chick and, then daily and weekly growth. An easily read, simply worded text accompan- ies the black-and-white photographs. Generally, anthropomorphism does not enter the text. Pre- school and primary grade teachers can use the book to begin discussion of the birth process, family life among birds, or similarities between life experiences of living things. The text empha- sizes the growth of the young bird into an adult with vivid pink feathers. Since the photographs are not in color, it may be hard for young chil- dren to understand this major difference between the young and adults. Cynthia 5. Sunal</page></plain_text>
