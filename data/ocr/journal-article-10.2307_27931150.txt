<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anatolian Elements in the EB III Culture of Palestine By Haya Ritter Kaplan In a recent article I pointed to the possibility that there might be a gap at Arad between Strata IV and III because the beginning of EB II in Palestine was preceded by an EB IC phase contemporary with Queen Meryet-nit; this phase is missing at Arad. This gap may even be extended over the entire Palestinian EB II period on the strength of two sets of parallels : The close similarity between the types of jars from Phases G and H in the 'Arn?q and the Arad pottery; and analogies between the decorative patterns of the " Abydos ware" from Arad and the decorations of the 'Am?q Phase H pottery1. The parallels with the eAmuq pottery and the gap during the EB IC period release Arad from its ties with the First and Second Dynasties of Egypt and open up the possibility of assigning Strata III-I to a period subsequent to these Dynasties, i.e. to the EB III, the period characterized by the Ijxrbet el-Kerak pottery2. I 1 Haya Ritter Kaplan, The Problem of the Dynastic position of Meryet-nit, JNES 38 (1979), 23-27; Ruth Amiran et al., Early Arad I [hereafter Early Arad] (Judean Desert Studies; Jerusalem 1978), PI. 57. According to Amiran, the occupation at Arad was continuous, with the EB II Phase immediately following that of EB IB ; consequently she does not recognize any EB IC occupation at the site; see Ruth Amiran, BASOR 195 (1969), 50-52. De Vaux denied the existence of an EB IC phase in Palestine; Palestine in the Early Bronze Age (R. de Vaux, Palestine in the Early Bronze Age, in: The Cambridge Ancient History, I 2, Third Edition [Cambridge 1971], 212.234). Since a jar similar in type to vessels from cAmuq Phases G and H (R. T. V. Braidwood - Linda S. Braidwood, Excavations in the Plain of Antioch, Vol. I [OIP 61; Chicago 1960], Figs. 207:1; 279:3.4) was found by Amelineau at Abydos (E. Amelineau, Les Nouvelles Fouilles a Abydos, 1895-1896 [Paris 1879], Pl. 13, lower row, pot 4 [no find spot]), the hitherto accepted view that the Abydos ware is found in Egypt only in First Dynasty contexts should be reconsidered. Now that Amiran's latest chronological revision extends the occupation at Arad into the time of the Second Dynasty (Ruth Amiran, The Date of the End of the EB II City of Arad: A Complementary Note to Early Arad I, IEJ 28 [1978], 182-184), the "Abydos vessels" clearly do not belong exclusively to the First Dynasty. See also, Ruth Amiran, The Painted Pottery Style of the Early Bronze II Period in Palestine, Levant 6 (1974), 65-68. Also see: Ruth Amiran et al, The Early Canaanite City of Arad, Qadmoniot 13 (1980), 2-19 (Hebrew). 2 An important consideration in Amiran's original dating of Strata III and II to the First Dynasty was the finding of Egyptian pottery in these levels. For Stratum III this consisted of a single sherd from the lower part of a vessel, while in Stratum II a jar with neck and rim missing was found (in Temple 1894). This jar, which Amiran thinks to be Egyptian in origin, has unusual combing over its surface and plastic decoration in the form of three semicircles (as restored by the excavator) which are described as a degenerate ledge handle. Amiran furthermore assumed that the jar bore the sereh sign typically found on many such jars from Egypt and Southern Israel (Early Arad5 51, Pis. 55:6; 114). She thinks that the jar belongs to the large and varied group represented by Nos. 74 and 75 in Petrie's Corpus of Protodynastic Pottery (Ruth Amiran, New Acquisition: First Dynasty Egyptian Jar from Rafiah [Israel Museum News; Jerusalem 1970], 81 f.). If this jar is Egyptian, it belongs to a type found in almost every royal tomb of the First and Second Dynasties, including the tomb of Khasekhemui. Generally speaking, the bulbous types are earlier than the narrow ones; but</page><page sequence="2">Anatolian Elements in the EB III Culture of Palestine 19 made this suggestion before the publication of the first volume of Arad excavation report. Drawing on the material presented in that report (Early Arad I), I will attempt to establish further links between artifacts from Arad and ceramic and non-ceramic Syro-Palestinian and Anatolian assemblages postdating the First and Second Dynasties. Additional comparisons between the material of Arad III-I, and that of Palestinian EB III and Central Anatolian EB II3 strengthen the assumption of the parallelism between cAm?q Phase H and Arad III-I as well as helping to indicate that Anatolian elements exist in the Palestinian EB III beside the fjfirbet el-Kerak material. Arad Parallels with Palestinian and non-Palestinian Sites 1. One-Handled Cup This type of vessel is common in Strata III?I at Arad, where it is called a "cup bowl". Drawing mainly on comparisons from Anatolia, we shall try to show that all the types of this cup in Palestine occur within the EB III period. The Arad cups are generally covered with red burnished slip4. Palestinian parallels are found in late Jericho tombs, apparently including the late EB III assemblage of mixed Tomb D125. These examples are covered with red burnished slip and sometimes with black; one cup has both6. Kenyon called this type of vessel a "one-handled cup"7. They are common in Central Anatolia, where they are generally burnished both red and black (or brown), compared to the generally red Arad vessels and the red and black Jericho examples. Seton Lloyd observed that vessels from Polatli were red burnished while their counterparts from Ahlatlibel were black burnished8. The colour of the burnished slip is apparently not significant. there are some narrow jars in First Dynasty contexts while some slightly broader jars Hike the Arad jar) are datable to the Second and Third Dynasties (G. A. Reisner, Mycerinus [Cambridge, Mass. 1931], 208 f.). While Emery also considered the narrow jars to be late, he noted that the First Dynasty bulbous jars of Group 3 were occasionally found in later assemblages. He assumed that such jars were re-used (W. B. Emery, Archaic Egypt [Harmondsworth 1961], 210). It should also be borne in mind that no sereh sign was in fact, found and that the fragment of plastic decoration was not necessarily the vestige of a degenerate ledge handle, as restored. All this leads to the conclusion that the Arad jar could date later than the First or even Second Dynasties. 3 The nomenclature adopted in this paper is the one Mellaart employed until 1979, when he subsumed Central Anatolian EB II into EB III A Q. Mellaart, Egyptian and Near Eastern Chronology: a Dilemma?, Antiquity 53 [1979], 6-18). Most of the parallels cited below are of the Copper Age (EB II) of Central - ana occasionally Western Anatolia. According to Mellaart's old chronology, Anatolian EB II ended c. 2300 B.C., followed by a transitional phase of one hundred years before the beginning of EB III. To the EB II period belong Ali?ar Id, Troy II and Alaca H?y?k Levels 8-5 and the Royal Tombs. He regarded the EB II-III transition, including the end of Troy II as contemporary witn the Sixth Dynasty; see J. Mellaart, Anatolia, c. 4000 - 2300 B.C., in: The Cambridge Ancient History, I 2, Third Edition (Cambridge 1971), 363-405. Using radiocarbon dates corrected by dendrochronological calibrations and high chronology Mellaart has recently dated the end of the Sixth Dynasty to 2387 B.C., a date would therefore also indicate the end of Palestinian EB HIB and its parallel phase (I) in the 'Arn?q. 4 Early Arad, 45, Pis. 14:1-9; 24:32. 5 See Appendix I. 6 . .

At Ali?ar in Anatolia parallels came from the Copper Age assemblages (Fig. l:e)13 found in Levels 7-11M (mound) and Levels 13-14T (terrace)14. At Alaca H?y?k, this group is paralleled by Cup Al-c-530 (Fig. 1 :f)15; the "cup bowl" type is common at this site in Phase III (the Copper Age; Levels 8-5) and in the Royal Tombs, i.e. it is contemporary with those from Ali?ar and other Central Anatolian sites16. The shoulder of the cup from Alaca is nail impressed, a common form of decoration there. Nail impression is common at Alaca on completely or partly red burnished one-handled cups17. At Jericho this decoration appears for the first time on an unstratified vessel from Tomb A12718, and is common on vessels from the late EB III tombs. At Arad, nail impression is found on vessels from Stratum III onward19. One handled cup with a flat base, found in Stratum II at Arad (Fig. 2:2)20 recalls the shape of an Ali?ar cup (Fig. 2:b)21, with fluting, an element of ffirbet el-Kerak vessels. A vessel differing slightly from the others in this group, from Stratum I at Arad (Fig. 3:a)22, resembles an Alaca H?y?k cup (Fig. 3:b)23 even in the way its handle is joined to the rim. Orthmann assigned this vessel to EB II-EB III, while a similar vessel from Tarsus is dated to EB III24. Amiran regards it as parallel to Type 128 (Fig. 3:c) from Tombs 1501 and 1535 at Lachish, where the vessel is "unclassified" and the date suggested is EB II-EB III25. 9 Early Arad, Pl. 24:31.32. 10 J.

According to Mellink these Ali?ar strata parallel Phases H and the beginning of Phase I in the eAm?q; M. J. Mellink, Anatolian Chronology, in: R. W. Ehrich (ed.), Chronologies in Old World Archaeology [hereafter COW A] (Chicago 1965), 126. Orthmann has Ali?ar Levels 7-11M overlap EB II and the beginning of EB III, paralleling Levels 8-5 at Alaca H?y?k (W. Orthmann, Die Keramik der Fr?hen Bronzezeit aus Inneranatolien [Istanbuler Forschungen, 24; Berlin 1963], 14-16, Taf. 9). Note that the parallel he offers (p. 86) between the Copper Age and the Akkadian period is based on items from a tomb which may have been dug from above and would thus be later in date; see also Mellink, op. cit., 112. 15 As determined in the excavations its place is between Stratum 5 and 6 (Copper Age) (7.20-7.40 m. depth), see: H. Z. Ko?ay, Les Fouilles d'Alaca H?y?k, Rapport Pr?liminaire sur les Travaux en 1937-1939 (Ankara 1951), 145.156, Pl. 102:6; Orthmann, op. cit., Pl. 46:11/78. 16 See: S. Lloyd, (below, . 81), Table XX; According to Mellink, Level 8 at Alaca H?y?k coincided with Phase H in the eAm?q, and the Royal Tombs were contemporary with the Akkadian Period and Phase I (partially overlapping H and J) in the eAm?q: Mellink, op. cit. (above, n. 14), chart, pp. 126.127. It may be noted that the Hirbet el-Kerak pottery, which is found alongside these cup types, in the late Jericho tombs, also occurs in the Alaca Royal Tombs, and in Levels 8-5, see: H. Kaplan, The Tomb at Kinneret and the Date of the Alaca Royal Tombs (Museum Haaretz Yearbook 1974/ 75; Tel Aviv 1975), 16-22. 17 Orthmann, op. cit.

Von der Osten noted that this type of small cup with raised loop handle is typical of the latter part of the Copper Age (Fig. 3 :d)26. Thus, the one-handled cups of Arad point to a date of Palestinian EB III and a connection with Central Anatolian EB II. 2. Bowls with Distinct Bases A bowl with raised disc base (Fig. 4:a), which functioned as a lamp was found in Stratum III at Arad27. At Jericho this bowl belongs to Type L and also served as a lamp28. No type L bowls were found in Tomb A12729, but they were common in mixed Tomb D12. Moreover, all the Type L bowls from this tomb30 were also found in the late Jericho tombs: F4 (upper and lower layers), F2 (Fig. 4:b)31 and F3. Therefore, it may be assumed that the Type L bowls from Tomb D12 belonged to the late assemblage from this tomb, i.e., to EB III. At Ai this bowl type appeared for the first time in Stratum VI, dated to EB III A32. According to de Vaux, bowls of this type belong to the phase characterized by the ffirhet el-Kerak pottery, i.e. to EB III33. 3. Shallow Rounded Small Bowls This type of bowl is dominant in Strata III-1 at Arad. The bowls are generally covered with red slip inside and out, and are sometimes also burnished34. Most examples show traces of soot, indicating that the bowls served as lamps. Thus, the excavator called this type "lamp bowl". These bowls belong to Type F at Jericho, slipped or burnished red on the interior, and sometimes also on the exterior, they also served as lamps35. These bowls were common in the late tombs but missing from Tomb A12736. This type of bowl first appeared in Tomb D12, and many of its subtypes are as common in Tomb D12, F2, F3, and F4 as the Type-L bowls37. Both Stratum II at Arad and Tomb F 3 at Jericho yielded bowls of this type made from light grey clay38. One of the bowls from Arad Stratum II (Fig. 5:a)39 parallels a burnished black and brown bowl found at Etiyoku?u (Fig. 5 :b)40. At Ahlatlibel, bowls of this type are burnished inside 26 Von der Osten, op. cit. (above, . 13), 164.170, Pl.

The Anatolian bowls are considered contempo rary with Levels 5-8 at Alaca H?y?k42. The type of small bowl common in Anatolia also has a loop handle rising above the rim, e.g., the bowl from Etiyoku?u or that from Level 11 at Polatli (Fig. 5:c)43. A similar small bowl, found in Stratum II at Arad, is also called "lamp bowl" (Fig. 5:d)44. Examples of this bowl in especially coarse ware were found in Stratum II at Arad (Fig. 6:a)45 as well as in Tomb D12 and the upper level of Tomb F 4 at Jericho (Fig. 6:b)46. The context of a bowl of this type from Ai is not mentioned47. A similarly coarse bowl was found at Alaca H?y?k, apparently in the upper strata of the Copper Age (Fig. 6:c)48. 4. Pendants A number of mother of pearl pendants with two perforations were found at Arad in Stratum III and one came from Stratum I (unconnected with the Chalcolithic material) (Fig. 7:a)49. One of the Stratum III pendants50 is paralleled by a pendant from Jericho, also of mother of pearl, found in the lowest stratum (E2) in Tomb F 4 (Fig. 7:b)51. A square pendant with two perforations at opposite corners, was found in Stratum III at Arad (Fig. 8:a)52, similar pendants are common at Ali?ar in assemblages of the Copper Age (Fig. 8:b)53. A small polished celt of greenish stone, with two unperforated bores in its upper part (Fig. 9:a), was found in Stratum II at Arad54. The excavator compared it to a similar object from the 'Am?q, Phase G, floor 14 (also with unperforated bores; Fig. 9:b), which Braidwood thought to be a pendant55. A comparable object was found in the Copper Age assemblage at Ali?ar56. 41 Ibid., Pis. 21:5/04; 23:5/32. 42 Ibid., Pis. 5.9. 43 Ibid., Pl. 29:6/20.6/21; S. Lloyd, op. cit. (above, . 8), Fig. libili.

One of these, from Stratum II, was incised with cruciform linear decoration (Fig. 10 :a)57. The incised cross is a common decoration on many of the whorls from Ali?ar and other Anatolian Copper Age sites (Alaca H?y?k, Tarsus, etc.). The Anatolian whorls are of various sizes, some of them comparable to the Arad example (Fig. 10:b.c)58. Cruciform patterns are found on a variety of objects from Alaca H?y?k and the Royal Tombs (see below note 97). 6. Grooved Beads Beads of ivory and bone, with spiral or straight grooves (Fig. 11 :a), were found in Arad Stratum II. The excavator suggested that these were made to imitate shell beads59 and compared them to the small faience beads (diam. c. 4 mm.) with straight grooves found in the tomb of Hernit (wife of Zer) at Sakkara (Tomb 3507)60. Apparently, no grooved faience beads were found at Arad. Some grooved bone beads were found at Jericho in Tomb F 3 (Fig. ll:b)61. At Alaca, in assemblages paralleling Palestinian EB III grooved beads of gold and frit were found. They were common in Royal Tomb (Fig. ll:c)62. 7. Potter's Mark An incised cross appears on the bottom of a cup-bowl from Arad Stratum II63. Incised crosses are found on Palestinian vessels earlier than EB III. They also appear on two fjfirbet el-Kerak bowls from the lowest stratum of Tomb F4 at Jericho64. Another potter's mark appears on a platter from Temple 1894, Stratum II, at Arad (Fig. 12:a). According to Amiran, this mark resembles the sign accompanying the serek symbol found at Turah in Egypt65. However, this mark may also belong to a later period, as the same potter's mark appears on a jar from the Giza necropolis (Fig. 12:b)66 from the end of the Fourth beginning of the Fifth Dynasties. Incised cross marks also appear on the bottoms of some vessels from the Kinneret tomb67, elements of which can be paralleled to finds from the Royal Tombs at Alaca H?y?k.

Another cruciform potter's mark from the Kinneret tomb is a multiple cross (Fig. 13 :a)69 incised on the bottom of a juglet that is comparable to a juglet from Tomb F4 at Jericho (Fig. 13:b)70. 8. One Handled Jug with Two Loop Handles or Degenerate Handles on the Body Unlike the foregoing parallels, this vessel is not found in Central Anatolia. It is cited here in order to strengthen the assumption of an EB III date for Strata III-I at Arad. The jug has one loop handle and two loop handles on the body. In Israel this type of jug belongs to EB III assemblages; at Arad it appears along with jugs that have two degenerate handles on the body. Sometimes such handles are associated with two knobs (Fig. 14:a)71. A similar jug was found at Jericho in Tomb F 5, which is one of the late EB III tombs (Fig. 14 :b)72. Degenerate handles are also frequent in Tomb A at Jericho where they are associated with knobs which Garstang thought simulated anthropomorphic features (Fig. 14:c)73. At Troy this type of jug is a new shape at the end of Troy II, but is not found in Troy III; it sometimes has knobs. Blegen assumed that the type originated in the Cyclades or the Greek mainland (Fig. 14:d)74. However, about the same time "face-unis'5 and "face-lids" appeared at Troy and in the Konya Plain; human features also occur on ffirbet el-Kerak ware75. 9. The Arad House The typical Arad dwelling consisted of one large room with an attached small room. The large room had interior benches all around its walls (Fig. 15 :a)76. Two-room houses are also known. Among the parallels to this house type cited by Amiran77 is one from Phase H in the eAm?q (Fig. 15:b)78. Another apparently two-room house was also found at Tell el-?ud?de Phase H79. The Arad house is a broad-room type, while those at Tell el-?ud?de appear to be long-room houses. However, the long room houses are also found at Arad in Strata III and II80. 68 Some of the pottery from the Kinneret tomb may also date (from) EB III; see: Kaplan, op. cit.

According to Lloyd, the EB II period (Copper Age) of Central Anatolia lasted from c. 2600 to c. 2300 B.C., and, as stated earlier, paralleled the EB III period in Palestine81. On the other hand, Mellaart, in his original determination of the span of the Anatolian EB II, raised the possibility that the period could have begun 200 years earlier and ended perhaps a century later. This span of one hundred years, he thought, might represent the transition between the catastrophe that affected most of the Anatolian sites c. 2300 B.C. at the end of the EB II period, and the beginning of EB III; c. 2200 B.C. would mark the beginning of the Anatolian EB III proper. Mellaart's chronology was based on a number of synchronisms between Anatolian EB II and the later Old Kingdom in Egypt82. To Mellaart's synchronisms may now be added elements from Polatli and Alaca H?y?k paralleled in Egypt in the Fourth - Sixth Dynasties. Comparisons Between EB II Central Anatolia Pottery (Polatli and Alaca H?y?k) with that of Palestine, Syria and Egypt The deep bowl with two knobs found in Level 11 at Polatli (Fig. 16:a)83 is a fjfirbet el Kerak type, similar in shape and features to bowls from Stratum XI at Beth Shean (Fig. 16:b.c), Beth Yerah (ffirbet el-Kerakf4 and Am?q Phase H (Fig. 16:d)85. Two bowls, from Levels 11 and 8 at Polatli (Fig. 17:a.b)86, parallel specimens from the upper layer of Tomb F 4 at Jericho (Fig. 17:c.d)87. A parallel to the bowl from Polatli Level 8 was also found in the Am?q, Phase H88. All these bowls are characterized by a cyma recta profile which, according to Braidwood, is typical of the ' red black burnished ware" (i.e. tjlirbet el-Kerak ware)89. A Type F bowl with a red cross painted inside and a red band around its rim was found in Tomb F2 at Jericho (Fig. 18:a)90. Another with a red-brown multiple cross painted inside 81 Initially S. Lloyd divided the Copper Age into two phases. The early one began c. 2600 B.C. and ended c. 2100 B.C., while later extended from c. 2100 to c. 1900 B.C. (op. cit. [above, n. 8], 33, Fig. 5). Later, he considerably reduced the span of the Copper Age to c. 2600-2300 B.C. only (S. Lloyd, Early Anatolia [A Pelican Book; Harmondsworth 1956], Table XX). 82 Mellaart, Anatolia, op. cit.

The "multiple cross" is found at Polatli both on rounded bowls similar to the Jericho bowls and on bowls with indented base92. The latter shape is also found in the 'Am?q93. At Polatli it appears in Level 11, along with red-black burnished ware94. "Red-cross" (Fig. 18:c) and "multiple-cross" (Fig. 18:d) decoration occur together at Polatli in the period of transition between Phases I and II95, but only the "red cross" continued into Phase II, i.e. into Anatolian EB III96 when it became a hallmark of the period97. The crescent handle with central knob appeared in all four phases at Polatli (Fig. 19:a)98. In North Syria, this handle occurred on JJirbet el-Kerak ware (Fig. 19:b)99. At Arad the handle appeared in Stratum II (Fig. 19:c)100. A squat, miniature red burnished bowl (or cup) with a flat bottom of the "local ware" group (Fig. 20 :a)101 has parallels in Egypt from the Sixth Dynasty, i.e. a red-black burnished pottery cup (Fig. 20:b)102 and a stone cup from Giza (Fig. 20:c)103. A small, globular necked jar, red burnished inside and black burnished outside, also belongs to the "local ware" group at Polatli Level 8 (Fig. 21 :a)104.

Worth noting that only the "red cross" inside a bowl is also found in Palestine later, in a MB II context, see for instance, J. Ory, Excavations at Ras el eAin II, QDAP 6 (1938), 107, Fig. 2B. 97 S. Lloyd, op. cit. (above, n. 8), 46. The cruciform decoration found on Anatolian pottery in late EB II suggests that this decoration might be linked to the cross motif on contemporary non-ceramic Anatolian objects. a. The cross motif is especially common on beads and on the gold plaques with raised dots from the Royal Tombs at Alaca H?y?k (Kosay, op. cit. [above, n. 15], Pis. CLV. CLXIX:2. CXCVIII. CC VI. CCVII). The cross motif picked out in dots on the gold pin from the Kinneret tomb (above, n. 67, Pl. XXXV), allows the dating of the late phase of this tomb to the end of the Palestinian EB III; see Kaplan, op. cit. (above, n. 68), 16-22. b. Various intertwined cruciform designs, including multiple crosses, appear on the standards from Alaca H?y?k; Kosay, op. cit. (above, n. 15), Pis. CXXX.CLIILCLIV.CLXIV:D.6, (Fig. 18:e). c. A multiple cross decorates the gold overlay of a greenish jade pendant from Tomb H at Alaca H?y?k: Kosay, op. cit., Pis. CXXXIV, CXL j^f. d.

This jar may also be compared to one of the "globular small jars" from Stratum II at Arad; the jar is red burnished (Fig. 21 :c)106. All three examples have the same rim. A copper bowl from Tomb A at Alaca Hiiyiik (Fig. 22 :a)107 is comparable to stone and pottery bowls in Egypt dated to the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties (Fig. 22 :b)108; note also a small bowl from Tomb F 4 at Jericho (Fig. 22 :c)109. Miniature cups with straight walls and flat bases found at Alaca Hiiyiik in the Copper Age assemblages (Fig. 23:a.b)110 belonged in Egypt to the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties (Fig. 23:c.d)m. Summary The conclusions arising from the parallels and comparisons cited above may be summarized as follows: 1. A synchronism exists between Palestinian EB III and Central Anatolian EB II (including the transition of EB II to III). Central Anatolian EB II also parallels the Egyptian Old Kingdom, although Central Anatolian EB II terminates before the end of the Palestinian EB III and at the end of the Egyptian Fifth Dynasty112. (The Sixth Dynasty parallels the transition period from EB II to EB III, see below.) 2. On the basis of parallels between the "local ware" at Polatli and artifacts of the Egyptian Sixth Dynasty, it may be assumed that the transition between Phase I and Phase II at Polatli when the "local ware" ended, falls within the limits of the Sixth Dynasty. The same applies to the hundred-year gap which, according to Mellaart, intervenes between EB II and EB III in Central Anatolia (Phase I at Polatli is contemporary with Central Anatolian EB 3. The initial appearance of the "red cross" and "multiple cross" motifs at Polatli during the transition between Phases I and II, also fell within the limits of the Sixth Dynasty. In Palestine this occurred in the late Jericho tombs towards the end of EB III which also must be placed within the Sixth Dynasty. 4. Strata III-1 at Arad existed during Palestinian EB III rather than EB II. Even if the Arad dates are viewed in the light of Mellaart's higher corrected chronology, Stratum II 105 G. A.

V,VI). 112 This is approximately what Mellaart has lately posited. According to him, Anatolian EB II ended within the reign of Neferirkare, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty, whose name is recorded in the Dorak tombs: Antiquity, op. cit. (above, n. 3), Fig. 1. The transition of the Anatolian EB II to III and the end of Troy II all fell within the Egyptian Sixth Dynasty, see, Anatolia, op. cit. (above, n. 3), 405.</page><page sequence="11">28 Haya Ritter Kaplan could still fall within the limits of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties. Additional support for this dating comes from two radiocarbon samples (P-1742 and P-2109) from Stratum II at Arad113. 5. The cultural links of Arad during the EB III period are to Syria and Anatolia rather than to Egypt. 6. fjfirbet el-Kerak assemblages are not the only link with Anatolia during Palestinian EB III. Arad assemblages, for instance, lack fjirbet el-Kerak ware but represent links to Anatolia along earlier pottery traditions which continued to exist114. Appendix I In Tomb D12 at Jericho EB II vessels were found together with EB III pottery and fjfirbet el-Kerak ware. I would like to raise the possibility that the "cup bowl" types in this tomb belong to the late assemblage. Cup bowl, Type A. 1. a (Fig. 24 :a)115, also occurs in Tomb F 2 together with fjfirbet el-Kerak ware (Fig. 241b)116 ; on the other hand, no cup bowls were found in Tomb A127, dated to EB II. Kenyon considered Tomb A127 to be later than Tomb A108, which marks the end of her Proto-Urban period, but earlier than the late F tombs, which contain fjfirbet el-Kerak ware of EB III117. Therefore, Tomb A127 falls within the EB II period118. The Anatolian parallels to the cup bowl types from Tomb D12 also make it possible to date these vessels to the Palestinian EB III: The large cup (Fig. 25:a)119 has a parallel at Ali?ar in the Copper Age assemblage (Fig. 25 :b)120, the high cup121 is also paralleled at Ali?ar122; and the squat shallow cup (Fig. 26 :a)123 is comparable to a cup from Ahlatlibel (Fig. 26:b)124. One-handled cups' (Fig. 27:a)125 were found in Tomb D12 and in Anatolia during the late Copper Age (Fig. 27:b)126. 113 J. A. Callaway-J. M. Weinstein, Radiocarbon Dating of Palestine in the Early Bronze Age, BASOR 225 (1977), 4.7.10. 114 Braidwood mentions early traditions of pottery in the 'Amuq which continued side by side with the Hirbet el-Kerak ware into Phase H, see: R.

Note also that de Vaux assigned this tomb to Phase II of his subdivision of the EB period, op. cit. (above, n. 1), 213. But it seems that the vessels from the upper layer of Tomb A 127, layer 1, belong to the EB III era. 119 Jericho, Fig. 36:21. 120 Von der Osten, op. cit. (above, . 13), 176, Pl.
