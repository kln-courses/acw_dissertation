<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph H. Gardner A HUXLEY ESSAY AS "POEM" OF ALL THE ACKNOWLEDGED NINETEENTH-CENTURY MASTERS OF NON- fictional prose, Thomas Henry Huxley raises in its most acute form the critical problem of justifying non-fiction as "literature" and "art." As scientist, educator, and agnostic, Huxley more than makes good a claim to significance as "background" and grist for the mills of intellectual and social history. Nor would many deny that his writings - whether they be treatises addressed to the Royal Society or essays published in the Fortnightly - are remarkable for their clarity, forcefulness, and grace of style. But on what grounds can any of them be termed "literature" and in what sense can their author be called an "artist?" The very people who conscientiously include him in their syllabuses may very well be those who most enjoy the joke of Dickens's including The Collected Poems of T. H. Huxley among the false book-backs with which he decorated his study at Gadshill. Even the very texts out of which Huxley is taught in literature courses prejudice his right to be considered by English de- partments at all. One, for example, compares him to Mill, concluding that both "enter only a little way into the 'domain of art proper.' They were both scientific rationalists and as such devoted first of all to 'the literature of fact,' not to 'the literature of the imaginative sense of fact.' . . .So far as their prose styles go, therefore, Mill and Huxley were 'journeymen' of a high order, but journeymen nonetheless."1 Even laying 'William E.

Gardner aside the fact that these remarks ignore what Huxley himself held to be the close relationship between (or even identity of) scientific rationalism and "the imaginative sense of fact," they can be refuted, in the case of at least one of his essays, by a close analysis of the writing itself, an analysis that will reveal a solid basis for a claim for Huxley as "poet." Such an analysis need rest only on two widely held assumptions. One assumption is that in practical criticism the traditional distinction between "rhetoric" and "poetry" is most easily made by examining the way in which a given author uses metaphor in any given work. In rhetoric metaphor plays a secondary, subservient role, either 1) illustrat- ing or clarifying a meaning pre-established by discursive modes; or 2) by its appeal to the emotions predisposing the audience toward a desired action; or both. But in poetry its role is primary; the metaphor is the message. It is at once the mode of cognition by which meaning is dis- covered, the linguistic form in which it is embodied, and the vehicle by which it is conveyed.2 The other assumption is that poetry and rhetoric can be further distinguished by a difference between the relationship, in each, of meaning to action. In rhetoric meaning is prior to action; the one adheres to the writer and the other to the audience. In poetry mean- ing and action are fused; both adhere to the writer, being expressed in and by the composition, which the audience merely contemplates 2 The distinction goes back at least as far as Aristotle and is still very much alive, form- ing, for example the ultimate basis for Levine and Madden's distinction between "prac- tical prose" and "aesthetic prose" - The Art of Victorian Prose (Oxford, 1968), pp. vii-xxi. Moreover, both the distinction itself and the method for applying it were readily available to Huxley and his contemporaries. For example it can be found in two theo- retical works highly influential in nineteenth-century aesthetic thought. In his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres Hugh Blair clearly relegates metaphor to a secondary role; it is simply "a great branch of the ornament of Style." The discursive meaning, or idea, is always primary: "the figure is only the dress" (Facsimile Edition, ed. H. F. Harding, 2 vols. [Carbondale, 1965], I, pp. 272, 277). In the Biographia Literaria, on the other hand, Coleridge asserts that true poetry need not display the superficial form of verse; it need only maintain an organic relationship between its parts and its whole and result from the operation of the "esemplastic power" of the poetic imagination, which "blends and ... fuses, each into each, . . . the idea with the image." While poetry "sub- ordinates . . . the manner to the matter," it does so, paradoxically, by fusing the idea with the image so that the idea is the image, the image the idea. (Ed. J. Shawcross, 2 vols. [Oxford, 1907], II, pp. 9-12.) But despite the currency and general acceptance of these notions they seem curiously hard to hold on to when it is Huxley who is under the critical microscope. Even his most knowledgeable, perceptive, and sympathetic critics are capable of such juxtapositions as that contained in these two sentences: "Huxley strove after the forcible as well as the clear expression of ideas and it is in this striving that he exploited the poetic potentialities of language. There is in Huxley's writing . . . the ex- istence of the rhetorical statement, which sacrifices 'clarity' to 'effectiveness.' " The same essay goes on to quote Huxley himself on rhetoric: "gilding refined gold would, to my mind, be less objectionable than varnishing the fair face of truth with that pestilant cos- metic, rhetoric." (C. S. Blinderman, "Semantic Aspects of T. H. Huxley's Literary Style," Journal of Communication, XII [ 1962], 174-75. )It does not seem to me too much to say that in his metaphors of refined gold and pestilant cosmetics Huxley himself both implies and illustrates the distinction between poetry and rhetoric I am invoking. VICTORIAN STUDIES 178</page><page sequence="3">HUXLEY ESSAY formally. Elder Olsen has reminded us that in dramatic poetry a char- acter's speech is both lexis and praxis, meaning and action: "What the poetic character says in the mimetic poem is speech and has meaning; his saying it is action, an act of persuading, confessing, commanding, informing, torturing, or what not." Hence metaphor as action leads us through itself to the speaker as acting. "For metaphor is not simply a figure of diction in poetry; it is also someone's thinking, significantly, that something resembles something; it is the thought, that is, of a certain character in a certain situation, and it is significant of these things."3 Clearly Huxley does frequently use metaphor rhetorically, either to illustrate and clarify4 or to incite to action.5 But with equal frequency - as, for example, in one of his most celebrated paragraphs - his use of metaphor involves complexities that rhetorical principles cannot unravel. In his inaugural address as principal of the South London Workingman's College Huxley observes that, were our lives to depend upon our ability to play chess, no father would allow his children nor any state its citizens to grow up without at least knowing a pawn from a knight: Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth, that the life, the fortune, and the hap- piness of every one of us . .. do depend upon our knowing something of the rules of a game infinitely more difficult and complicated than chess. It is a game which has been played for untold ages, every man and woman of us being one of the two players in a game of his or her own. The chessboard is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always fair, just, and patient. But we also know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance. To the man who plays well, the highest stakes are paid, with that sort of overflowing generosity with which the strong shows delight in strength. And one who plays ill is checkmated - without haste, but without remorse.6 To a certain degree the metaphor does function rhetorically, but as rhetoric it is ultimately unsuccessful because it, in itself, raises difficult problems of meaning. What, or more accurately, Who, is the hidden chess player? How literally are we to take him either allegorically or 3 "William Empson, Contemporary Criticism, and Poetic Diction," Critics and Criticism, ed. R. S.

DECEMBER 1970 179</page><page sequence="4">Joseph H. Gardner anthropomorphically? And which? Huxley's own attempt to explicate does not help us very much: My metaphor will remind some of you of the famous picture in which Retzsch has depicted Satan playing at chess with man for his soul. Substitute for the mocking fiend in that picture, a calm, strong angel who is playing for love, as we say, and would rather lose than win - and I should accept it as an image of human life.7 The introduction of the "calm, strong angel" expands the anthropomor- phism into definite suggestions of theism. And if the angel is playing for love, how then are we to account for the ruthlessness of his play and the remorselessness of his victories? I do not offer to answer these questions. The point is simply that the passage does raise problems of meaning that puzzle precisely because the available answers seem to run counter to the discursive argument of the essay in which the metaphor appears and to the major patterns of thought in Huxley's work as a whole. Put in dif- ferent terms, the chess metaphor disturbs because Huxley has shifted from a rhetorical mode to a poetical mode without, perhaps, being him- self aware of the shift, and certainly without providing his auditors clues that they must make an appropriate shift in response. Nor are the two modes integrated into any unified vision. Neither in the chess metaphor do we see illustrated a meaning that will serve as a prior cause to a posterior effect: our being moved to revamp curricula to include large doses of scientific instruction. We are not so moved because the metaphor does not invite our attention to focus upon its "objective" accuracy as an analogy descriptive of an ex- ternal reality, "nature," so much as it lures us into attempting a specif- ically "literary" explication to grasp Huxley's "subjective" understanding of a symbolic force or entity called "nature." (Accordingly, we do not overlook the capital "N" that graces the word throughout the essay.) The metaphor does not tell us as much about "nature" as it does about Huxley. It is mimetic, not dialectic, since it imitates a state of a human mind just as Hamlet's celebrated "ulcer" metaphor is not an objective description of the political state of Denmark at a given point in history: it is an imitation of a response of a human spirit to the human condition. Unlike Hamlet's, Huxley's metaphor is unsatisfying because it betrays deep- seated and unacknowledged contradictions in the state of mind it imi- tates, contradictions that are not to be interpreted organically as char- acteristics of that which it attempts to reproduce. We cannot balance or reconcile the discords struck when the anthropomorphic theism implied 7 Pp. 82-83. VICTORIAN STUDIES 180</page><page sequence="5">HUXLEY ESSAY by the hidden chess player is juxtaposed to the agnostic skepticism dramatized in other Huxley essays.8 Arguing that his highest ideals in writing were accuracy and veracity, Aldous Huxley observes that his grandfather used metaphors "seldom and only with the greatest caution" since while "ideas can be vividly expressed in terms of metaphor and simile... analogies are rarely complete [and their] vividness is too often achieved at the cost of pre- cision."9 Ironically, Aldous presents Thomas Henry not "as a literary man" but only as a rhetorician; he becomes a "poet" when metaphor displaces discursive logic as mode of cognition and structural principle in his writings, as it does take in at least one of his most significant, most characteristic, and best known essays, the lay sermon delivered in Edin- burgh, 8 November 1868, and later published, with great sensation, in the Fortnightly as "On the Physical Basis of Life." Like much "poetry" Huxley's essay is devoted to the examination of a paradox, what he calls the "union of materialistic terminology with the repudiation of materialistic philosophy."10 And like most "poetry" it can be submitted to "prose" explication, i.e., a discursive "meaning" can be extracted from it in the form of a paraphrased "argument": The ulti- mate nature of both matter and spirit is unknowable; as Hume has demonstrated, both "materialism" and "spiritualism" lie outside the limits of philosophical inquiry (162). However, "the order of Nature is ascer- tainable by our faculties to an extent which is practically unlimited" (163), but we must remember that order does not, logically, imply neces- sity. Order is ascertained by manipulating symbolic systems or termi- nologies, and "if we find that the ascertainment of the order of nature is facilitated by using one terminology, or one set of symbols, rather than another, it is our clear duty to use the former; and no harm can accrue, so long as we bear in mind that we are dealing merely with terms and symbols" (164). Thus we may exploit the usefulness of materialistic terminology without becoming materialists. The paraphrase, of course, is based upon explicit, rhetorical statements Huxley makes in his con- cluding paragraphs, just as a satisfactory paraphrase of Shakespeare's 8 Again Huxley himself indicated that he was at least preconsciously aware of the kind of distinction I make. One of his students reports him as saying "Here in my teaching lec- tures, I have time to put the facts fully before a trained audience. In my public lectures I am obliged to pass rapidly over the facts, and I put forward my personal convic- tions. And it is for this that people come to hear me."

DECEMBER 1970 181</page><page sequence="6">Joseph H. Gardner "Sonnet 73" could be based upon the explicit rhetoric of its concluding couplet. Accordingly, it bears the same relationship to the total essay as the statement "the older you see me grow, the more you love me" bears to all fourteen lines of the sonnet. To grasp some sense of the totality of Shakespeare's poem we usually begin by examining its metaphors, their meanings, their structural relationships and functions, and their sig- nificance as verbal actions. The same method applied to Huxley's essay will reveal that the total essay is built upon a complex cluster of meta- phors that i) emphasizes the symbolic nature of all knowledge; 2) equates all symbolic systems with religious myths and evaluates their validity; while, 3) chastising man's eternal penchant for philosophical error. Huxley leads his audience into the cluster of metaphors that is both the discovery of the essay and the determinant of its structure by dramatizing a suppositional situation: "Let us suppose that knowledge is absolute, and not relative, and therefore, that our conception of matter represents that which it really is" (158). The materialistic assumption will then bring with it as its necessary correlate determinism, and "as surely as every future grows out of past and present, so will the physiol- ogy of the future gradually extend the realm of matter and law until it is coextensive with knowledge, with feeling, and with action": The consciousness of this great truth weighs like a nightmare, I believe, upon many of the best minds of these days. They watch what they conceive to be the progress of materialism, in such fear and powerless anger as a savage feels, when, during an eclipse, the great shadow creeps over the face of the sun. The advancing tide of matter threatens to drown their souls; the tightening grasp of law impedes their freedom; they are alarmed lest man's moral nature be debased by the increase of his wisdom. (159-160 ) The elaborate rhythmical pattern of Huxley's celebrated "caesura sen- tences,"1 their muted hints of alliteration and assonance, and their intricate manipulation of parallelism, balance, and antithesis all serve to fuse into one complex whole a series of three closely related images, related in that all involve acts of oppression and obliteration which carry with them intense emotional responses, since each is totally beyond the power of conscious control of those they affect. It is through this meta- phor-cluster that Huxley discovers the paradox that is the essay's "mean- ing." Nightmares, eclipses, and tides are "real"; they are "facts" of experience just as the statements of physiologists about protoplasm are 11 So-called by Aldous Huxley, The Olive Tree, pp. 74-77. VICTORIAN STUDIES 182</page><page sequence="7">HUXLEY ESSAY demonstrably "real" and "factual." But they are not "great truths." For, after all, one does, eventually, awaken from a nightmare. No eclipse lasts forever, and tides ebb as well as flow. The impotent fear and frus- trated anger of dreamer, savage, and drowning man result from the false supposition that a temporary state represents permanent and necessary reality.12 Materialistic philosophy, correspondingly, depends upon the equally false supposition that "our conception of matter represents that which it really is." By bringing us to realize this, Huxley has shown us how the light of truth can be eclipsed by the shadow of error and how it can be brought out again on the other side. But, paradoxically, the truth is that there is no truth; we are enlightened by discovering that the ultimate nature of matter and spirit is eternally shrouded in darkness. Huxley's thinking on this point, his idea, is fused throughout the essay with his image, the eclipse metaphor and its correlate figures. (In addition to being tied to the "nightmare" and "tide" metaphors, the "eclipse" metaphor itself contains two more or less distinct, though obviously related patterns of imagery- light and darkness images on the one hand and images of reduction, engulfing, and swallowing up on the other. I stress the "eclipse" as overriding because it involves all these image patterns at once.) Acknowledging that he derives his philosophical skepticism from Hume, he questions the appropriateness of the term skepticism: "If a man asks me what the politics of the inhabitants of the moon are, and I reply that I do not know; that neither I, nor any one else, has any means of knowing; and that, under these circumstances, I de- cline to trouble myself about the subject at all, I do not think he has any right to call me a skeptic" (162). Huxley's choice of lunar politics as an example of the unknowable is not accidental; it is determined by the eclipse metaphor. In a solar eclipse the moon interposes itself between the earth and the sun. The physical darkness of the savage results when in the place of the sun he sees only the moon. Correspondingly, mental darkness results when we turn our eyes from those things which can illuminate us and look toward that which is forever in obscurity. Hence our "fear and powerless anger" at lunar darkness is just as irrational as that of the savage witnessing an eclipse - and just as fruitless, just as spiritually and morally misguided. For in Huxley's imaginative vision, the state of Victorian man is metaphorically equated with that of the savage. "We live," he says with quiet force, "in a world which is full of 12 Notice that Huxley underlines the savage's philosophical error by making him guilty of a scientific one: it is the earth, not the sun, that is enshadowed by an eclipse.

The illumination brings with it a corresponding moral imperative: "the plain duty of each and all of us is to try to make the little corner he can influence somewhat less miserable and somewhat less ignorant than it was before he entered it" (163). But how can we brighten the comer where we are if we interpose the moon and its pol- itic-s between ourselves and our source of light? We will see the light only when we accept the usefulness of materialistic terminology in clari- fying the order of nature; "the alternative, or spiritualistic terminology, is utterly barren [like the moon?] and leads to nothing but obscurity" (164; italics mine). But we should never equate "usefulness" with "truth." The religious implications of the eclipse metaphor hinted at in the preceding paragraph are explored throughout the essay. The "fear and powerless anger" of the savage are to be considered the response of a man who sees his god being destroyed. Recognizing the sun as his pri- mary source of light, warmth, and ultimately life itself, the savage im- putes to it supernatural powers and worships it as a mighty god. An eclipse can only mean that his god has either forsaken him or has been swallowed up by another god whose characteristics and powers must be antithetical to those of the sun: darkness replaces light, evil triumphs over good, death usurps life, the light of the world falls before the imp of darkness. The keystone of his whole sense of order and meaning in nature crumbles away. Huxley has carefully prepared us to recognize these implications in the metaphor. In the paragraph immediately pre- ceding that in which it is introduced, he writes: "what is the difference between the conception of life as the product of a certain disposition of material molecules, and the old notion of an Archaeus governing and directing blind matter within each living body, except this - that here, as elsewhere, matter and law have devoured spirit and spontaneity?" ( 159). The reference to Archaeus serves to reduce spiritualistic interpre- tations of nature to the level of primitive superstition, preparing us for the even greater primitivism of the savage, while at the same time clear- ing the way for the ultimate point that all our conceptions of nature are - and can be - only symbols and myth. Moreover, Huxley's phrasing encourages us to transfer the epithet "blind" from "matter" to "the old notion of Archaeus" and to glimpse, however faintly, a hint of the light and darkness, illumination and obscurity images that control the essay. The operative word in the remaining portion of the sentence is the verb "devoured," which anticipates the eclipse swallowing the sun and the tide eating away at the land. But to conceive of matter and law devour- VICTORIAN STUDIES 184</page><page sequence="9">HUXLEY ESSAY ing spirit and spontaneity is, ironically, to duplicate the mental processes of the savage, to interpret nature by the anthropomorphizing mechan- isms of myth. Hence the irony of the sentence undercuts not only the spiritualistic notion of an Archaeus, but also the materialistic notion that life is "the product of a certain disposition of material molecules." It too is only superstition, myth, false religion, the mental state of a savage, since it depends upon the fallacy of assuming that "our conception of matter represents that which it really is." The exposure, through metaphor, of both spiritualism and ma- terialism as false religions constitutes the essay's most elaborate motif. If the patterns of irony in the Archaeus metaphor prepare us for the nightmare-eclipse-tide paragraph, a subsequent passage makes its im- plications even more explicit: For, after all, what do we know of this terrible "matter," except as a name for the unknown and hypothetical cause of states of our own consciousness? And what do we know of that "spirit" over whose threatened extinction by matter a great lamenta- tion is arising, like that which was heard at the death of Pan, except that it is also a name for an unknown and hypothetical cause, or condition, of states of conscious- ness? In other words, matter and spirit are but names for the imaginary substrata of groups of natural phaenomena. (16o) The reference to Pan not only parallels the earlier reference to Archaeus but also ties eclipse (matter "extinguishes" spirit) to nightmare just as the word "devoured" in the Archaeus sentences emphasizes the link be- tween eclipse and tide. In Roman myth Pan and his cohorts, the Panisci, cause bad dreams. Nor would it be too far-fetched to see another set of associations being exploited in the references to Pan. Huxley's essay was published in 1868, less that two years after the succes-de-scandale of Swinburne's Poems and Ballads, a volume which included a poem de- voted, precisely, to recording the lamentations heard at the death of Pan. One of the effects of the "Hymn to Proserpine" - perhaps the effect as far as outraged Victorians were concerned - was to reduce Christianity to the same status (in degree as well as kind) as heathen myth and to assert that of the two superstitions, the pagan is in many ways superior. Huxley's essay is just as blasphemous, and it makes a similar point. The pale Galilean killed Pan; materialistic science is killing Christ, and to lament the death of the one is as irrational an expression of savage superstition as to mourn the passing of the other. Moreover, we are again reminded of Huxley's over-arching meaning: if Christ is equated with Pan, materialism itself is also a form of superstitious myth. The reduction of the figures of Judeo-Christian tradition to the equivalents of such DECEMBER 1970 185</page><page sequence="10">Joseph H. Gardner heathen gods as Archaeus and Pan lends additional force to the labelling elsewhere in the essay of Auguste Comte as "a modem Agag." Samuel hewed Agag into pieces because he worshipped false gods; Huxley's metaphors have established materialistic positivism as a false religion. Hence there is more than merely a clever rhetorical joke in his celebrated assertion that "in fact, M. Comte's philosophy. . . might be compendi- ously described as Catholicism minus Christianity" (156). Similar functionings of the eclipse metaphor to equate material- ism with savage superstition, pagan myth, and Christianity as false re- ligions can be found elsewhere in the essay. When Huxley says that in accepting the most elementary conclusions of materialistic physiology "you are placing your feet on the first rung of a ladder which, in most people's estimation, is the reverse of Jacob's and leads to the antipodes of heaven" (153-154), he is using Jacob in much the same way that he later uses Archaeus, Agag, and Pan, while at the same time reinforcing the links between his controlling metaphors. Like the eclipse, the new Jacob's ladder leads from the light of heaven into the darkness of hell; in other words, the prophet's dream becomes a nightmare. Additionally, the metaphorical concept of materialism as superstition and false religion controls much of the diction in which he describes the structure of the materialistic myth. "Protoplasm, simple or nucleated," he says, "is the formal basis of all life. It is the clay of the potter: which, bake it and paint it as he will, remains clay, separated by artifice, and not by nature, from the commonest brick or sun-dried clod" (142). The strategem here is transparent; Huxley takes the one metaphor of Judeo-Christian tradi- tion most popularly used in the literature of his day and appropriates it to explicate the scientific myth. But given the paradox embodied in most of the metaphors of "On the Physical Basis of Life," we are not bothered by the potter as we are by the hidden chess player in "A Liberal Educa- tion." In Isaiah the identity of the potter is established explicitly: "But now, 0 Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay and thou our potter; we are all the work of thy hand." The ramifications of the eclipse meta- phor have shown Isaiah's Lord to be a creature of myth, the equivalent of Archaeus, Pan, and the sun-gods of savages; accordingly, the ma- terialist's potter is also the mythological god of a false religion. Else- where Huxley speaks of single-celled organisms, "multitudes of which could in fact dance upon the point of a needle" (132); he describes the "thaumaturgy" of plants (149), and explains digestion as the process by which we "transubstantiate sheep into man"; the lobster we sup upon, he says, undergoes "the same wonderful metamorphosis into VICTORIAN STUDIES 186</page><page sequence="11">HUXLEY ESSAY humanity" (147). Apparently the religion of materialism has its own panoply of angels, its own doctrine of incarnation, its own eucharistic sacraments. More complex is a passage in which Huxley explains that scien- tists must believe that the properties of water in all its forms result from the properties of its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen: We do not assume that a something called "aquosity" entered into and took posses- sion of the oxidated hydrogen as soon as it was formed, and then guided the aqueous particles to their places in the facets of the crystal, or amongst the leaflets of the hoarfrost. On the contrary, we live in the hope and in the faith that, by the advance of molecular physics, we shall by and by be able to see our way as clearly from the constituents of water to the properties of water, as we are now able to deduce the operations of a watch from the form of its parts and the manner in which they are put together. Is the case in any way changed when carbonic acid, water and nitrogenous salts disappear, and in their place, under the influence of pre-existing living protoplasm, an equivalent weight of the matter of life makes its appearance? (152) Certainty is always impossible in matters of religion: like the spiritual- ists, the devotes of materialism live only by "hope" and "faith," fed by the same deductive processes as those of many Victorian Christians. Huxley is speaking to an audience suckled on Paley's Evidences and the argument from design: by the analogy of the watch Victorian Christians were invited to deduce the existence of God. Huxley uses the analogy to deduce matter as the ultimate reality and prime mover of the universe. But he is not simply turning the devices of the spiritualists against them- selves, transforming their concept of a watchmaker God into the petard by which they can be hoist for ridicule. Rather, by equating the hopes and faiths of the materialists with those of their spiritualistic contempo- raries and implying that both are sustained by identical logical processes, he is once more illustrating that both are false religions. Hence there is little strain in seeing the watch analogy give way to yet another version of the essay's controlling metaphor. The component elements of proto- plasm "disappear" and "an equivalent weight of the matter of life makes its appearance." Ironically, this "eclipse" may clarify rather than ob- fuscate the "order of nature" - but only in terms of the materialistic myth. If we say on the one hand that the eclipse metaphor exposes both spiritualism and materialism as false religions - and, on the other, main- tain that the kind of "poetry" Huxley is writing has as its final end truth, clarification, or vision, metaphor serving as the cognitive mode by which truth is discovered - then we can properly ask of the essay: what is true DECEMBER 1970 187</page><page sequence="12">Joseph H. Gardner religion? To label something false is to imply that something else is true; the sun does not remain obscured forever but reappears on the other side of the eclipse with new clarity. The metaphors in "On the Physical Basis of Life" imply that at this stage in his development Huxley elevated Agnosticism to the status of True Religion with the Unknowable as its god. Nowhere in the essay is this made explicit, but the eclipse meta- phor practically demands it. In his after years he himself seems to have become aware of where his metaphors had taken him. Twenty years later he observes in "Agnosticism and Christianity" that "the extent of the region of the uncertain, the number of the problems the investigation of which ends in a verdict of not proven, will vary according to the knowledge and the intellectual habits of the individual Agnostic. I do not very much care to speak of anything as 'unknowable.'" On incor- porating the essay into the collected edition, he added a footnote: "I confess that, long ago, I once or twice made this mistake; even to the waste of a capital 'U.' "13 Poetry fuses idea with image; if Huxley's metaphors control his thinking, his thinking also controls his metaphors. His lay sermon is in- tended to bring comforting words to those of his contemporaries who felt themselves gripped by the nightmare of despair as materialism eclipsed those spiritual lights that had given order and meaning to their lives. In other words, it was the very eclipse Huxley describes that had contributed to the "darkling" of the Victorian plain. "On the Physical Basis of Life" was written within a year of both the appearance of "Dover Beach" in the New Poems of 1867 and the blossoming of Huxley's friendship with its author. Arnold had despaired at the ebbing of the sea of faith; Huxley's drowning man founders in the rising tide of ma- terialism. But Huxley himself knows that his founderer is only "threat- ened," only thinks he is going to drown. Inspired by the light of his true religion, he knows that no tide stands still; knows that materialism itself may ebb, leaving the possibility open for the Sea of Faith to flow - a possibility that Arnold has notoriously overlooked. Moreover, he is him- self indifferent to the tides because he realizes that they do not represent ultimate reality. Spiritualistic faith he denigrates to the status of a savage superstition that is useless as a symbolic system; materialism and its sister-god, determinism, he deals with as the High Priest of Agnosticism who has seen the light on the other side of darkness: "For my part, I utterly repudiate and anathematize the intruder.

But the High Priest is not always the agent of a wrathful god; in his kinder moments he has his own saints in his own heaven whom he can invoke to intercede for those who follow strange gods in the temple of materialism: ". . . could David Hume be consulted, I think he would chide them for doing even as the heathen, and falling down in terror before the hideous idols their own hands have raised" (16o). In discussing Huxley's use of metaphor as mode of cognition and vehicle for embodying and conveying meaning, I have necessarily implied much about how metaphor also operates as structural principle. Only a few further remarks need to be made. Huxley begins the essay by de- scribing the "nightmare" world created by the notion that there is such a thing as "the physical basis or matter of life" (131). The notion itself is nightmarish enough to besieged Victorian idealists; Huxley is merciless in depicting the kind of bad dream in which everything tums into some- thing else, in which images of beauty corrode into visions of horror and loathsomeness. Since they are all composed of protoplasm, giant Se- quoyahs dissolve into the microscopic fungi multiplying "into countless millions in the body of a living fly" (131); great Finner whales fade into phosphorescent plankton ( 132); the golden hair of a young girl is trans- muted into a jellyfish (132), and the ceaseless whirling of cellular matter transforms "the wonderful noonday silence of a tropical forest" into "the roar of a great city" (136-137). Even the principle governing the actions of protoplasm is itself nightmarish. Physiology, Huxley tells us, "writes over the portals of life- 'Debemur morti nos nostraque.'" Granted that rare visionaries like Lucretius or Whitman could elevate such a principle into the basis of an optimistic faith; Huxley makes no attempt to do so. Protoplasm is for him merely the physiological equivalent of Balzac's peau de chagrin (145-47). But he does not intend that we remain para- lyzed by bad dreams forever; hence he shifts from the nightmare to the eclipse as his governing metaphor. I propose, he says, "to lead you through the territory of vital phaenomena to the materialistic slough in which you find yourselves now plunged, and then to point out to you the sole path by which, in my judgment, extrication is possible" (155). On the surface it would seem that Huxley has introduced a new metaphor. But upon consideration we note that the pattern of action embodied in the slough metaphor is identical with that of the eclipse: in one side and out on the other. This pattern governs the remainder of DECESIBER 1970 189</page><page sequence="14">Joseph H. Gardner the essay both as a whole and in its individual parts. One example can stand for many. In a passage referred to earlier, Huxley says: If scientific language is to possess a definite and constant signification ... it seems to me that we are logically bound to apply to protoplasm . .. the same conceptions as those which are held to be legitimate elsewhere. If the phaenomena exhibited by water are its properties, so are those represented by protoplasm, living or dead, its properties. If the properties of water may be properly said to result from the nature and disposition of its component molecules, I can find no intelligible reason for refusing to say that the properties of protoplasm result from the nature and disposition of its molecules. But I bid you beware that, in accepting these conclusions, you are placing your feet on the first rung of a ladder which ... is the reverse of Jacob's and leads to the antipodes of heaven. It may seem a small thing to admit that the dull vital actions of a fungus, or a foraminifer, are the properties of their protoplasm and are the direct results of the nature of the matter of which they are composed. But if . . . their protoplasm is essentially identical with, and most readily converted into, that of any animal, I can discover no logical halting-place between the admission that such is the case, and the further concession that all vital action may ... be said to be the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it. And if so, it must be true ... that the thoughts to which I am now giving utterance, and your thoughts regarding them, are the expression of molecular changes in that matter of life which is the source of our other vital phaenomena. ( 153-4; italics mine) In a sense the passage is highly rhetorical, but the rhetoric is governed and controlled by the eclipse metaphor. The relentless progression of "ifs" duplicates the action of the eclipse, each conditional sentence swal- lowing up more and more of the spiritualistic light until it is blotted out altogether. The remorseless logic proceeding from an axiom we cannot possibly deny - and would not choose to since we do not know where it is leading us - leaves us as impotent in our fear and anger as the savage watching the extinction of the sun. Moreover, our frustrated emo- tions blind us to the fact that the steps in the logical process are, pre- cisely, conditionals, no more necessarily representing ultimate reality than the darkness of the eclipse. When, one page later, Huxley explains that the obscurity of materialism involves "grave philosophical error," the true light begins to emerge from the other side. The pattern exhibited in these paragraphs is the pattern of the essay as a whole. If this explication of "On the Physical Basis of Life" seems some- what long and detailed, hopefully it will also suggest the kind of riches with which Huxley can repay us if we approach him not as a rhetorician but as a poet. The particular Huxley essay is not unique in the canon; while it is beyond the scope of the present essay to treat any of his other writings, many could be analyzed by the same method here applied to VICTORIAN STUDIES 190</page><page sequence="15">HUXLEY ESSAY only one and could equally be shown to be "poetry," lacking only the superficial form of verse.14 However, even on the basis of only one essay it is possible to make generalizations above and beyond the statement that Huxley at his best is indeed a "poet" and not merely a journeyman of letters. Earlier I cited Elder Olsen's observation that metaphor is not solely a statement that something resembles something else but that it is also someone's thinking, significantly, a similarity between two things exists. I return to it now a propos a remark by a man who knew Huxley as well as anyone of our time, William Irvine: For Huxley, writing was always an instrument .... Literature in the narrow sense could hardly have claimed him, partly because he was too practical and utilitarian to care for mere art and partly because he was not sufficiently interested in its characteristic subject matter, which is man as such. He could become absorbed in man as a physical mechanism, as an anthropoid ape, as a citizen and social animal, as a delicate machine for the discovery of scientific truth; but not in man as a per- sonality and a human being. With all his splendid talents for friendship and affec- tion, he remained, from the deeper psychological point of view, indifferent to people. In fact... he was not even interested in himself. Seldom has so vivid and articulate a writer had so little of importance to say, even in his most intimate letters, about himself.15 If by "literature in the narrow sense" Irvine means "poetry" as I have attempted to define it, then I cannot agree less. Few writers of the nine- teenth century have given us a more fruitful or insightful glimpse of the state of mind of Victorian man as such than Huxley does in the cluster of metaphors that lie at the heart of "On the Physical Basis of Life." And by working out the meanings inherent in those metaphors he dramatizes the responses of one human spirit to the human condition more fully than any volume of intimate correspondence ever could. If he himself may never have claimed to be a man of letters, literature can surely claim him. University of Kentucky 14 Again I am echoing Coleridge's distinction between "poetry" and "poem," a distinction that allows Coleridge to label as poetry the prose of Taylor, Burnet and the unknown author of Isaiah. I have felt it much better to try to make my point here by treating only one essay in detail than by attempting a survey of metaphoric patterns in the Collected Essays as a whole. But such a survey cries out to be done. Oma Stanley has remarked upon Huxley's tendency in his early work to "romantically" personify "nature." ("T. H. Huxley's Treatment of Nature," JHI, XVIII [1957], 120-27.) As my remarks on the chess metaphor in "A Liberal Education" indicate, this seems a logical place to begin. 15 "Carlyle and T. H.
