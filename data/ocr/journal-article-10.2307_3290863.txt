<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE TEACHING OF GREEK LITERATURE IN ENGLISH' By KATHRYN BOWEN The Hockaday Junior College, Dallas, Texas In most of our universities where courses in Greek literature in English are taught, this work is under the direction of our lead- ing Greek scholars-a class to which I make no claim to belong, and it may seem on the face of it that my attempt to discuss this subject is sheer presumption. But let me say that I am not trying to tell any Greek scholar how to teach his advanced courses, nor am I recommending a "jazzing up" of any senior college course which is necessarily concerned with more specialized problems or with advanced research. I am recommending, first, that the high schools, instead of teaching mythology incidentally or through books on the subject, present it rather in the story setting of the Iliad and the Odyssey, putting these on the required English read- ing list instead of leaving them merely to be suggested or recom- mended for supplementary reading as is now the case; second, that we college teachers of Latin and Greek introduce into our curricula another, a more simplified survey course of Greek literature, open to sophomores, that they may early get the benefit of essential back- ground material for English and American literature as well as for that of other languages. It used to be customary for all our classical meetings to include papers on the teaching of Latin, with various suggestions for en- livening the courses-"sales" talk, if you please. The presentation of papers on this subject, even the offering of courses in some of the colleges, at least in my state, seems to have waned. I think we shall feel the loss. From the start, let me warn you, this paper is going to be concerned to a large degree with "selling" the course in Greek literature in translation to the non-Latin student and to the Latin 1 Read before the Southern Section of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, at New Orleans, La., November 26, 1937. 20</page><page sequence="2">GREEK LITERATURE IN ENGLISH 21 student himself, to the curriculum builders and the college ad- ministrators-yes, even to our god-like classicists, teachers of Greek in the original, on whose lap lies the very life of all classical study. We have often experienced the charm of finding ourselves in the past; yet our "modern" pedagogy places its main emphasis on edu- cating for the present, and we, the teachers of "ancient" languages come in for the most acrimonious attacks because of the very names of our subjects. How can we meet these arguments? How can we relate ourselves to the present? Of course you and I know we are dealing with the immortal, the universal, and the few stu- dents of Latin and Greek in the original know it; but these few are not enough to keep us and the classics alive. Yes, I know that "for the sake of staying alive, we ruin the reasons that make living worth-while,"2 but the fact remains we have to be alive to enjoy living. The phrase, "our debt to Greece and Rome," could be re- stated for the sake of variety in some such terms as "the debt of the past to the present," thus giving due credit to many of our con- temporary writers of modern literature, who may be doing more than some of us to preserve the Greek spirit. Many of our con- temporary writers, artists, and thinkers are calling upon us to re- new our acquaintance with Greek, perpetuating Greek philosophi- cal ideas and aesthetics, if not in the original, at least in transla- tion. So Greek literature in English is going to be taught. If we re- fuse to teach it, it will be taught by others less competent, less alive to the Greek spirit, less imbued with a feeling for it. Its message to the present, too vital to be disregarded, is directly in line with the aims of modern education. To the extent that we show our cog- nizance of its use in the present, to that degree we sell it to the modern student. An ancient work [says Gilbert Murray] may, or indeed must, gather about itself new special environments and points of relevance. Thucydides and Aristophanes' Knights and even Jane Austen are different things now from what they were in 1915. I can imagine a translation of the Knights which would sound like a brand new topical satire. I think it clear that in any great work of literature there is a soul which lives and a body which perishes; and further, since the soul cannot ever be found naked without any body at all, it is making for itself all the time new bodies, changing with the times.3 2 Juvenal, Satires viii, 84. 3 Gilbert Murray, Religio Grammatici: Boston, Houghton, Miffin and Co. (1918), 14.</page><page sequence="3">22 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL In like manner let us realize that the reason for the faith that is in us must be continually reaffirmed and restated in the latest peda- gogical terms. Relaxation is as disastrous in teaching today as it is in driving on our highways. Death and destruction follow. Because a former student, who recently visited our college, en- thusiastically reported to me that her course in Greek literature had been very valuable to her in teaching in the high school of Port Arthur, Texas, a course called "Our Heritage from the Past," I de- cided to write to a number of Texas schools to inquire if they had similar courses. I stated in the letter that in case I found this type of study was given in a number of public schools, I could the more effectively advocate the teaching of Greek literature in translation in colleges for the more adequate preparation of teachers for public school work.4 Most of the schools answered that they had no course so named but that the English and Latin departments taught mythology. One letter, however, from the San Angelo Junior High School, significantly says, "We cover some of this material in our seventh- and eighth-grade social science classes." Notate bene those magic words, "social science!" Can we use them in connection with things ancient? Social science, the sine qua non of the ultra modern- ists in education! That this was not merely a lapsus pennae of this superintendent is shown by the following extract from a letter, in answer to my inquiry, from Mr. Carr, whom we all know as a for- mer President of the American Classical League and as one who is in close touch with the various tendencies and developments in education. He says: Such a college course as yours would be immensely helpful to a prospective teacher of history or social studies in the elementary schools. Such a course would be of value also to a prospective teacher of a coordinated or integrated program, the core of which is usually a glorified course in social studies. Hor- ace Mann School for Girls has such a course running through the junior and senior high schools under some such title as "Man's Progress Through the Ages." Professor Carr also states that there is a growing demand for courses on the high-school level in "Classical Civilization" and that some experiments in this field are going on in New York City. 4 Port Arthur, I may add, has been rated among the highest 10 per cent of public schools in the United States by Columbia University.</page><page sequence="4">GREEK LITERATURE IN ENGLISH 23 Then why may we not be able to get a semester of Greek literature required as a preparation for teaching in lieu of just one of the pedagogy courses? Many high-school English teachers are also Latin teachers or former Latin teachers, for even superintendents often realize that Latin teachers can teach English more efficiently than some of those who majored in English itself. So I would suggest that these teachers use their influence to see that the Iliad and Odyssey are put on the required reading lists and taught in class rather than used as supplementary reading only. There is an Odyssey with notes published by Harper Brothers-and using Harper books gives us a chance to call attention to the XaMr&amp;&amp;ta ~Xovr7s babc'baovaov &amp;' Xoits of Plato, used with the torch-race emblem in the front-but I know of no similar Iliad. High-school editions of the Iliad and the Odyssey should have notes with references and quotations from contemporary poets. Do you know Arthur Guiter- man's Hymn to Mercury, which he composed when Fifth Avenue, New York, was decorated with figures of Hermes on the traffic lights? Here is your chance to read Horace's Hymn to Mercury also and advertise college Latin. In connection with stories of Apollo read Miss Millay's Daphne: Why do you follow me? Any moment I can be Nothing but a laurel tree. Any moment of the chase I can leave you in my place A pink bough for your embrace. Yet if over hill and hollow Still it is your will to follow I am off;-to heel, Apollo! Of course there are many earlier famous English writers to whom you may refer; but which is more effectual with modern students, to tell them to compare a given passage with Browning or Tenny- son or with Millay, whom they perhaps have seen and heard read- ing her own poems? To enliven your study of the Iliad and the Odyssey, or of mythology, if you insist on teaching it separately, may I recommend the Dialogues of Lucian, which of course may be used in the college classical club as well as by the lively high-school boys in your Latin clubs. I use the translations in the Howe and</page><page sequence="5">24 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Harrer Greek Literature in Translation, another Harper book. High- school teachers do not need to be reminded of the Glorious Adven- ture of Richard Halliburton-anathema to some literal-minded persons, I know-to be used in connection with the study of the Odyssey. Would not the use of his book be called in modern peda- gogical terms "functional approach"? Would not the student be feeling a need of knowing these stories if everyone were talking of Halliburton and his following the trail of Odysseus? What boy or girl would fail to be interested in the chapter on Crete and the Minoan Age in his Seven League Boots? At least the Texas boy will be excited by the challenge he throws out to the rodeo experts and the bull fighters. Because of the emphasis Latin teachers of today put on deriva- tive study, the student is already word-conscious. Will not the high-school boy and girl be as interested as the college student in the coming into our language through the Iliad and the Odyssey of such words as chimerical, thersitical5 and stentorian?6 They are in- terested too in the fact that the newspapers refer to an aged jurist as "the Nestor at the bar," and to the football coach as a "Men- tor," not to speak of one editor's calling "an Achilles' heel" a twelve-letter word meaning "that's my weakness." Then if you wish to point a moral as well as "adorn a tale" or, that which is more important, justify to your superintendent the study of the Iliad and Odyssey, make use of the modern pedagogical emphasis on "character building" by such expressions as these from the Odyssey: Lay this truth to heart: Aye, and tell others: he who does Good deeds will find far better fortune Than he whose deeds are evil.7 or Let your heart rejoice, Old woman, but refrain, nor cry 6 They never forget Homer's picture of the loud-mouthed Thersites: "Only Thersites still chattered on, the uncontrolled of speech, whose mind was full of words, many and disorderly.... " S," ... and shouted in the likeness of the great-hearted Stentor with voice of bronze, whose cry was as loud as the cry of fifty other men."

It is evil To glory over the slain.8 As well as the usual Measure is best in all things.9 And the story of the captive women in the first book as well as in other parts of the Iliad10 is a protest against war, looking forward to The Trojan Women of Euripides, which the American Association of University Women recommended for use as peace propaganda. Recently I heard Vera Brittain say a novel of hers had been com- plimented as being the first record of the effect of war on women. That compliment, you and I know, should have been emended to read "one of the many following Homer and the tragic poets of Greece," not to speak of Vergil and of Horace's bellaque matribus detestata. In the magazine Time of August 16, 1937, the reviewer of Laura Riding's late book, A Trojan Ending, says the heroes are not the warriors but the women. This most recent use of Iliad material is also spoken of as giving a "valuable prototype of the modern world." For your college class you use, of course, the Lang, Leaf, and Myers' translation of the Iliad, and the Butcher and Lang of the Odyssey. Will you allow this course to be taught by those English teachers who have to stop with just that and cannot even consult the notes of the texts in the original for interesting sidelights? In answer to my request for his opinion concerning this subject, Pro- fessor H. N. Couch, of Brown University, among other interesting suggestions, says, "The ability to present the subject adequately, it seems to me, depends on a personal acquaintance with the tongue itself. But it is foolish and needless, when one has that equipment, not to make it more widely known." My college course in Greek literature has been criticized adversely on the ground that over half the time was spent on Homer. That same criticism may be justly applied to this paper. If the Iliad had been taught in pre- paratory schools, we could get on to the other types of literature 8 Ibid., 347.

But you will sympathize, for you know that Homer is a veritable storehouse, a liberal education in himself. A separate paper could be written on the value of the Iliad to a student in each separate subject in which he happens to be majoring. To the art student the reference to Apollo, the mouse god, suggests the statue by Scopas, and the majestic word-picture of Zeus interests him as having inspired the statue of Phidias, one of the seven won- ders of the world. The "Hermes" of Praxiteles, my girls noted, had been used in an advertisement by the well-known Neiman-Marcus Company, of Dallas, Texas. The students are interested by other references to art work such as the golden-studded sword or Hera's ear-rings, or perhaps you don't know that college credit is now given for courses in jewelry-making! Point out these things to the head of the art department. Perhaps you can get the Greek litera- ture course made compulsory, or at least recommended, for the art majors. The music student is interested to find at the end of Book I of the Iliad the earliest mention of song in responsive stanzas, afterwards known as strophe and antistrophe. The student of re- ligious education and philosophy sees a modern illustration of Homeric anthropomorphism in The Green Pastures. From the very beginning of the Iliad the student is preparing for the study of the philosophical drama by noting the signs of ifopts already in the char- acter of Agamemnon and Greek ideas of moderation as shown in the contempt in the phrase, "Thou heavy with wine." You can pile up these illustrations and find others for other types of stu- dents. What a help a required survey course in Greek literature would be to the college Latin teacher! How much we have to explain that should have been learned from Homer! Is it any wonder that we have no time for the appreciation of Horatian word order or that each year we cover less material in Latin? The college Latin stu- dent needs a background of material not only from Homer but also from knowing something of Archilochus, Sappho, and Alcaeus. It certainly interests the student of Horace to know that the poet's statement concerning leaving his shield at Philippi is merely follow- ing the literary precedent set by Archilochus as he daringly makes light of the Spartan mother's "either with this or on it" by</page><page sequence="8">GREEK LITERATURE IN ENGLISH 27 The foeman glories in my shield I left it on the battle field.... ending with I soon may find at little cost As good a shield as that I lost." He will appreciate Horace's Vides ut alta stet nive candidum Soracte. ... the more by comparison with Alcaeus' Jove descends in sleet and snow, Howls the vexed and angry deep, Every stream forgets to flow, Bound in winter's icy sleep.'2 or Nunc est bibendum nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus. with its model Now for wine and joy divine-- Myrsilus is dead. Now 'tis meet the earth to beat With quick and happy tread, For Myrsilus is dead! Myrsilus is dead!"s The student will not fail to be interested to note again that Pri- mum Graius homo-to use the Lucretian phrase-also used the metaphor of the ship of state that has served poets and politicians so long. Of course the appreciation of Catullus is heightened by one's having learned something of Sappho. Edna St. Vincent Millay- and who can forget her "Euclid alone has looked on beauty bare"? -besides other classical references, mentions Sappho a number of times in her works and so is naturally thought of by the modern student in connection with the Greek poetess. It was in the con- servative city of Athens, where woman's place was closely restrict- ed to the home, that the most adverse criticism was directed against Sappho. She lived in the freer atmosphere of Asia Minor, 11 Howe and Harrer, Greek Literature in Translation: New York and London, Harper Bros., 111. 12 Ibid., 113-114. 13 Ibid., 114.</page><page sequence="9">28 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL where women were, it seems, permitted an intellectual life. I think she would have loved Millay's Cherish you then the hope I shall forget At length, my lord, Pieria?-put away For your so passing sake, this mouth of clay These mortal bones against my body set, For all the puny fever and frail sweat Of human love,-renounce for these, I say, The Singing Mountain's memory, and betray The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet? Miss Millay's poem, "Justice Denied in Massachusetts," reminds us that Sappho too took part in political life and was at one time exiled. Comparing Miss Millay's poetry with that of Sappho is by no means to suggest any likeness between the latter and some of the modern poetry whose lack of meaning I find described in an article in the Saturday Review of Literature of May 23, 1936. This article, entitled "The Trouble with Modern Poetry," decries its lack of meaning and can furnish us an opportunity to show by con- trast the importance of sense as well as sound, as shown in Greek poetry. Most admirably is this contrast shown in the Introduction to The Pageant of Greece, by Livingstone, to my mind the most im- portant part of this book. (We have to excuse Mr. Livingstone when he, quoting Wordsworth, speaks of the Greek tragic poets as "next to Shakespeare," for, you know how the British are! "Ber- nard Shaw spent his life trying to correct certain codified stupidi- ties in the British mind," so I once heard Thornton Wilder re- mark.) Shaw's St. Joan, by the way, which we were fortunate in having the incomparable Miss Cornell interpret for us, has been compared to the Antigone, and you have followed, no doubt, re- viewers to whom Miss Cornell's vehicle of last year, The Wingless Victory, suggested the Medea. When the Livingstone book speaks of the Greek "economy," I wonder if Gertrude Stein is trying to get back to that quality. A rose is a rose, Is a rose, is a rose14 certainly concentrates on the one idea, rose. At the risk of appear- ing quite foolish or of seeming to compare anything today with the 14 Stein, Gertrude, Portraits and Prayers, An Elucidation.</page><page sequence="10">GREEK LITERATURE IN ENGLISH 29 perfection of the Greeks, I am merely trying to show that if we ex- pect to interest today's student, we must be alive to what is being said, done, and written today. We must try to interpret the past in the light of the present, or perhaps we should say in its darkness. But, of all the types of Greek literature, I believe the drama in- terests and attracts the modern student most. And when studying Greek drama one also studies philosophy. I recently heard a speak- er on biblical literature make this statement: "There is no such thing as mere literature. All that is literature has a meaning, a teaching, a purpose." Certainly in considering Greek drama you must disabuse yourself of the idea that the theatre's function is to amuse. Zeus has placed mortals in the path to wisdom and has ordained that suffering bring instruction; for even in sleep the painful memory of woe, presenting itself to the heart, instils obedience which comes thus to the unwilling, and surely this is a mercy of the gods who sit on their awful thrones with powers to com- pel." "Mirabile dictu," says my modern student (one who had had a little Latin and wanted to show off to her non-Latin roommate), "What's this I see in Vogue? Daughters of Atreus? Why, Atreus was the father of Agamemnon. Can anything ancient come out of Vogue? I'll take that to class. That will make a 'hit' with dear teacher." Yes, it was the same Atreus and the picture from a re- cent broadway production dealing with Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, and Electra-a beautiful full-page picture in the current issue of Vogue. And when this student brought it to class, another, a speech major, said, "There are also pictures from this play in the last num- ber of the Theatre Arts Monthly." One chief reason for the modern student's interest in Greek drama is-that which I just mentioned- the philosophy in drama, for I find it true that young people like philosophy, a fact which Thornton Wilder in his Woman of Andros notes in the following words: She cited often the saying of Plato that the true philosophers are the young men of their age. "Not," she would add, "because they do it very well; but because they rush upon ideas with their whole soul. Later one philosophizes for praise, or for apology, or because it is a complicated intellectual game." 15 Aeschylus, Agamemnon 176-183.</page><page sequence="11">30 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Of course, the obvious point to be made here in my connecting the present literature with the Greek is that, as you know, and as the author states, "The first part of this novel is based upon the Andria, a comedy of Terence, who in turn based his work upon two Greek plays by Menander." But the closest kinship to be noted in Wilder's novel is that with tragedy and philosophy. Among other quotations from the Greek is the famous prayer of Socrates: Beloved Pan, and ye other gods who haunt this place, grant that I may become beautiful in the inner man and may whatever I possess without be in harmony with that which is within. May I esteem the wise men alone to be rich. You have no doubt noted in the book a sense of Weltschmerz or lacrimae rerum, a feeling of consideration for others. And I re- cently heard Mr. Wilder say that the last four books of the Iliad, which, as he says, may be later, contain a certain magnanimity, a feeling for the tragedy of another's life. But you, being the classi- cists in your various communities, are probably familiar with this book, for you were called upon to review it for your clubs when its fame swept the country a few years ago upon its first appearance. Last year I was called upon by the speech department of my col- lege to address the student body on the subject of Greek drama in order to prepare for a production of Sophocles' Antigone, which the drama students were going to give that evening. I could have as- sumed an attitude of hostility to their attempting to produce the Antigone. I could have objected to its being cut. I could have said, "The Greeks would not have put the play on that way." But I considered it wiser to co-operate. "Half a loaf is better than none." I praised their production. I spoke on Greek drama in chapel and the next term the enrollment in my Greek literature class was doubled. To repeat, the student today appears to me to be interested in philosophy from the ethical standpoint. The relation of fate and freedom in Greek tragedy, such expressions as: "The strength of Necessity cannot be resisted," "From ills given by the gods there is no escape," "When was man ever so ill-fated?"'6 16 Cf. Walter R. Agard, "Fate and Freedom in Greek Tragedy," Classical Journal, Vol. xxrx, 117.</page><page sequence="12">GREEK LITERATURE IN ENGLISH 31 and the constant repetition of fate, necessity, chance, destiny, and God's purpose, the inscrutable purposes of the deity (the Vergil student will remember dis aliter visum)-these things are going at least to start him thinking. Greek tragedy and the attendant phi- losophy will make him look at things sub specie aeternitatis. He will come to note the universality of the Greek, that it is human nature in the broad. By contrast to this interpretation of life, this uni- versality, John Erskine says of the modern novelist that he spe- cializes in temporary and local detail, in what will make his story "date." "This method," he says, "partly accounts for the short life of many fine books which are so anchored in a passing moment that they depart with it." Man is the subject of Greek drama; the subject of the modern novel is Tom or Dick. The contrast with Eu- gene O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra naturally suggests itself here. For you must discuss it if you are relating your Greek litera- ture to the present. For since Eugene O'Neill has just won the Nobel Prize for literature, and since this play of his presumes to use the form of the trilogy of Aeschylus, will not your modern student be more interested in O'Neill's use of the Greek than any former dramatist's debt? You know the scores on which it has been con- trasted with the Greek. One classics professor, I heard, called it "an insult to Aeschylus"; others noted its lack of universality, its emphasis on exactly what the Greeks abhorred-abnormality. But you have read many reviews or written your own. All I wish to say is that it is a modern work and we must take cognizance of it. To me the most dramatic scene I have ever witnessed on the stage was the recognition scene between Electra and her brother, Orestes, when Blanche Yurka was taking the part of Electra. Her acting was superb. It was the Electra of Sophocles which Miss Yurka played in a series of matinees which ran contemporaneously with O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra. Nothing could be more beautiful than the love of Electra for her younger brother. That the O'Neill play should make of this an ugly thing causes us to dis- like to identify his characters with those of the Greek. They lack the universality and the nobleness of the ancient. Mourning Be- comes Electra is a modern psychological drama. It interests espe- cially students of pathological psychology. The Orestes legend is</page><page sequence="13">32 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL used, but from the heights of royalty the story of vengeance comes down to the level of solid New England burghers. No doubt, as Brooks Atkinson says in a review, the students of the new psychol- ogy will find convenient labels to explain why the mother betrays her husband and why the daughter takes the father's side. But I fear you will think that with me anything is acceptable if it is modern. I shall use only one illustration to show that the con- trary is true. I do believe we must be "live wires," so to speak, but there is no use in enlivening the classics if in so doing we destroy the beauty. There is no use in keeping alive anything in which the beauty has already died. An advertisement naming a beautiful dress with wings "Icarus," as a Fifth Avenue shop recently did, may be a lovely thing even if it is only an advertisement; but a book like John Erskine's Helen of Troy is considered by some of us a defilement, even if it is written by an English scholar and literary critic. In an article in the Saturday Review of Literature, September, 1926, when Erskine's Helen first appeared, I find many statements which I'd like to applaud. One says: Does Dr. John Erskine realize that when he renders vulgar the figure of Helen of Troy he does outrage to a myth, to a memory, which has cast a spell over the imaginations of the men and women of our Western World for nearly 3000 years? How he has the audacity to desecrate with a viler desecration than Paris was guilty of, his "lass unparalleled" is more than I knowl ... And here comes this clever professor pushing his way through the echoing galleries of antiquity for the sole purpose of translating the matchless wife of Menelaos into something which tallies with his own conception of suburban domestic- ity.... This critic, with whom I know you will agree, is especially irked by Erskine's treatment of the fourth book of the Odyssey. He says: The book ends, as it begins, with deep offense. One of the most beautiful and moving passages in all secular literature occurs in the fourth book of the Odys- sey. It is when Telemachus, and the son of Nestor, and Menelaos and Argive Helen herself suddenly feel their hearts stirred within them "with the desire for lamentation" when they remember the dread disaster that had been brought to life "far on the ringing plains of windy Troy." And at that moment of august silence, in that stately palace hall, white-armed Helen, the daughter of Zeus, the fairest among women, brings to the still group of mortals who for a moment of time would seem to have comprehended, would seem to have</page><page sequence="14">GREEK LITERATURE IN ENGLISH 33 taken upon themselves the sorrows of the whole world, a bowl of drugged wine with power "to lull all pain and anger in their hearts and bring forgetfulness of every sorrow." Even when confronted by the unsurpassed beauty of that legendary scene Mr. Erskine still finds himself capable of indulging in his frivolous innuendoes. He is not one to exclaim with good Doctor Faustus in a moment of frenzied intellectual exaltation: Was this the face that launched a thousand ships And burned the topless towers of Ilium! My own reaction here is to quote Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, auri sacra fames! For this is the same Mr. Erskine whose The Moral Obligation to be Intelligent we are fond of quoting. He knows, of course, the connection between the aesthetic and the ethical, the good and the beautiful in the Greek mind. "What is the drug that Helen pours into the wine but the distillation of her own beauty? She has become an abstraction for loveliness, ageless in her charm."17 If we want humor why not give the students T. V. Smith's Philosophers in Hades? He at least conveys the idea of the neces- sity of knowledge, the fact that the ancient civilization stands for knowledge, without any disparagement of character. In the second chapter, entitled, "Well, if it Isn't Socrates," I find this dialogue: Earthling: Is that what you meant by declaring virtue to be knowledge? Socrates: Yes; that and more. On earth I often saw virtues turn into vices through ignorance; courage become foolhardiness in the unknow- ing. It takes knowledge to make even virtue foolproof. An ig- norant person can become good only by accident; and not even accident can prevent a wise man from being good. Truly, an un- examined life is not worthy of man. If the treatment of this subject-by no manner of means to be considered exhaustive-only suggests to you many other examples of contemporary use of Greek thought, if it reminds you that we should not let others"steal our thunder," so to speak, i.e., teach our subjects-I am content. Since I know that you believe, with me, that Latin and Greek are the best educational instruments for in- tellectual development and for character-building, may I appeal to you? Scorn not at least the consideration of any and every de- '7 H. N. Couch, Greek Civilization, p. 23.</page><page sequence="15">34 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL vice-though you may hate the word-available for the teaching of these subjects. You may get your students into the spirit of the classics through your interpretation for them of the classics in translation. These courses may become feeders for your courses in the original. You who live on Lucretian heights may demonstrate the anti-Lucretius in him. Come down and answer the needs of the modern students to whom also the word palantes is applicable, for they truly seem "as sheep without a shepherd." Even the expert in pedagogy will see that you are giving them something which will, as they say, "function" in their lives. You are today's "priests of the Muses," you who have had the privilege of a real understand- ing from the Greek. May you give a portion to those who do not have this same privilege! Many a student who shies away from re- ligion as the church gives it you can inspire to talk freely of his own thoughts on immortality when you have introduced him to Plato. Often we speak of St. Paul's quoting Menander. Have you considered him, as E. K. Rand does, the Christian Odysseus (roXbrporos), "a man of subtle twists and turns-infallibly alive to the requirements of the moment"? We too must be like Odys- seus. There isn't a challenge which the modern expert in pedagogy throws out which we cannot meet with the same or superior edu- cational values inherent in the classics, but we have to live in the present, be both scholars and modernists. Every evangelistic sermon, so I'm told, must have three points, a death-bed scene, and a piece of poetry. My three points are: the Iliad and the Odyssey in every high school; Greek literature in English in the sophomore year; and all courses in Greek literature to be connected with modern life. The death-bed scene? Ah, our friends-those whom President Butler of Columbia so significantly called the Philistines of education, those who have been preaching our funerals for so long-will be glad to furnish the death-bed scene unless we modernize. The piece of poetry? I'll let you select your own, for since Latin and Greek are the most quotable of lan- guages, many will come crowding to your lips. As for me, I am glad I can still say with Cicero, "No teachers of the liberal arts are to be considered unfortunate" however long and vigorously they may be attacked.</page></plain_text>
