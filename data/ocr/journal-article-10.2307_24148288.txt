<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Herd of Red Deer. F. Fraser Darling. 226pp. Paperback. $1.25. Doubleday. 1964. This is a reprint of a classic study first pub lished by Oxford University Press in 1937. It exemplifies one of the first major behavi oral studies on a single species and popula tion. Not ethology, the text describes field studies, and even speculates anthropomorph ically in some instances. Social behavior is emphasized about the red deer of the Scot tish Highlands. Other aspects covered include territoriality, movement and its causes, repro duction, and senses. A dated, but complete and well-indexed bibliography is included. Highly recommended for the behavioral and ecology-minded teacher and student.</page></plain_text>
