<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DIVINE SOLILOQUIES IN GENESIS "Anthropomorphism" is a term that is often understood in too narrow a sense. It is a commonplace of biblical hermeneutics, to remark on the highly anthropomorphic descriptions of God to be found throughout the OT, and to add that these are characteristics of a simple, even "primitive," stage of theological development, suited to a circle of readers still at a some- what childish level of intellectual development. References to Goďs eyes, hands, heart, etc., are, we are told, pure metaphors and must be understood as such.1 This is perfectly true; but the emphasis is often one-sided, and may lead to an unjust depreciation of the human aspects of much of the OT material. It should be stressed, and students should be reminded, that any affirmation concerning God that can be made in human language is to a greater or less degree anthropomorphic and metaphorical. Our knowledge of God is fundamentally and essentially analogical, and analogy combines similarity and dissimilarity, the latter being as essentially part of it as the former.2 The natural desire to minimize this dissimilarity, to "purify" our concepts, to come as close as possible to forming a "proper" idea of the divinity, leads either to ever-increasing abstraction, so that the terms used become more and more "essential" and convey correspondingly less to our intelligence; or, by the via negationis, to definition by negatives, which has the same result.3 And however far the refinement is carried, 1 A. Angénieux in Catholicisme I (1948), s.v. "Anthropomorphisme," well distin- guishes between imaginative and intellectual anthropomorphism. Both may be found in religious literatures, but doctrinally they are widely different. The former is taken literally by the religion's adherents, the latter is understood to be figurative. In this article, as of course throughout the OT, we are concerned only with the latter. Cf. TWnT 4, 756s (s.v. morphē). 2 On the inevitability of anthropomorphisms, cf. Schmaus, Katholische Dogmatik I (3rd-4th ed. 1948), 245-252. On the anthropomorphisms of the OT in general, see Köhler, Theologie des A.T. (1936), 4-6 (quoted by Schmaus, op. cit., 249-251) ; Eichrodt, Theologie des A.T . I (3rd ed. 1933), 98-104; Schrade, Der Verborgene Gott (1949), 131-139. 8 Compare the opening chapter of Pseudo-Denis, De Divinis Nominibus (PG 3, especially cols. 588, 593), with its riot of negative compounds, which leave one with the impression (in Donne's phrase) of "some lovely glorious Nothing." There is both truth and unction in this lofty theology; but the Israelite writers knew what they were about when they adopted the via affirmationis . A divine Nothing, behind the Cloud of Unknowing, would not have had much appeal for the Hebrew shepherds and peasants; they needed the impression of a mighty Personality. "In der Tat schien es den Verkündigern des Gotteswillens offenbar viel weniger nachteilig, dass man über Jahves geistige Natur im Dunkeln tappte, als dass man über die persönliche Art seines Handelns und Wirkens im Ungewissen geblieben wäre." Eichrodt, op. cit . 99. The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, Vol. 17 (277)</page><page sequence="2">158 In Honor of Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara anthropomorphism can never be entirely escaped, for it is inherent in the human faculty of knowing, in statu viae . What we often have vaguely in mind, when we say, for instance, that a given book is "full of anthropomorphisms," but that another, treating equally of God, is relatively free of them, is the distinction between spiritual anthropomorphisms and physical ones.4 In reality, the statement that "God is spirit" (Jn 4,24) is no less anthropomorphic than "the just shall behold His face" (Ps 11,7). The difference is merely that the one uses a spiritual part of man, the other a physical, as a primum analogatum for expressing a truth about God. In each case a word and a concept are used which originate in analysis of man himself; they necessarily combine similarity with dissimilarity when they are predicated of God. In other words, they are both analogies. But this limitation on human thinking and expression, when the divinity is their object, by no means impedes the communication of truth; it is rather its natural and only channel. The OT writers, as has been remarked, are not in the least concerned to purify or refine concepts, in the philo- sophical sense. They are intent rather on communicating their realization of Yahweh's personality, His character as a living, willing God; and in this they are supremely successful, just because of their vivid and energetic use of the vocabulary of human physiology and psychology. Of them all, none surpasses the Yahwist,6 in his apparently unreflecting yet unerring adoption of picturesque anthropomorphisms. Lacking a scientific (but still anthropomorphic) theological vocabulary (such as was available to the Priestly author of Gn 1), it is precisely by means of such images that he manages to formulate and convey his massive and clear vision of the charac- ter of the God he worships. It is my purpose to examine here a particular form of anthropomorphism, partly physical, partly spiritual, in the use of which he stands practically alone among the historical writers of the OT :6 what may be called the divine soliloquy. 4 Cf. Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart , I (2nd ed. 1927), col. 367. 5 This title is used simply as a convenient label for the author or authors of that body of material which used to be called the J document, more vaguely referred to nowadays as the cycle of Yahwist traditions. Whatever we call them, the passages have coherence and a family resemblance, as every student knows, and clearly had an origin and history different from those of the "Priestly tradition." 6 The only comparable development of divine soliloquy is that by the Priestly writer in Gn 1. In 4 Kgs 21,4 (=2 Par 33,4), and 23,27, there are two isolated divine speeches with no audience specified. The prophets and psalmists of course introduce speeches of this kind, but that is in another style altogether. It is in his narrative use of these soliloquies that the Yahwist is unique. (278)</page><page sequence="3">The Divine Soliloquies in Genesis 159 Speech, traditionally regarded as one of the noblest faculties of man, is an obvious and natural choice for expressing the sentiments, will, judg- ments, etc., of the divinity. The myths of all peoples attribute speech to gods and goddesses (not to mention animals and the elements) ; but a special situation is created for the Israelite religious teacher (in this as in all other things) by the nature of his doctrine. Only the one God enters into consideration ; there can be no dialogue between divinities. If Yahweh is to speak, it must be either to His inferiors - elements, animals, heavenly ministers, men - or to Himself. The Yahwist, wishing to relate the religious prehistory of Yahweh's dealings with mankind, and confident in his under- standing of the ways of God, is not satisfied with recording external actions, and the interventions - better, the constant control - of Yahweh in the de- velopment of mankind. With a sublime simplicity, he reads God's mind, and interprets for us, plainly and directly, the motives and springs of action in that mind. Thus, in several key passages, he boldly undertakes the artistic creation of divine speeches, not addressed to any lesser beings but uttered in majestic self-communion by his unique and self-sufficient God. In this way he makes known to us the heart of that God, and conveys the essence of his own lofty theological doctrine. The Texts The following are the passages referred to (all in Genesis) :7 2,18 It is not good that the Man should be alone; I will make him a helper, suitable to him. 3,22 Behold, the Man has become like one of us, in his knowledge of good and evil ; so now, to prevent him from reaching out his hand and taking fruit from the tree of life as well, and eating it, and living for ever - ! 6,3 My spirit shall not remain (?) in mankind perpetually, for (?) they are only flesh. Their lifetime shall be 120 years. 6,7 I will blot out the human race [ ] from the surface of the earth [ ] for I regret that I ever made them.8 7 Gn 18,17-19 is omitted from this list, because it is generally admitted to be a later addition to the Yahwisťs narrative. The evidence of this is given in the com- mentaries. The present paper allows us to add a small confirmation, namely that its form, though based on the second of the two constructions to be discussed below, is elaborated quite differently from the seven passages accepted here as original. 8 The omitted phrases, "which I have created," "both man and beast, crawling things and birds of the sky," seem to be intrusions of P*s phraseology. (279)</page><page sequence="4">160 In Honor of Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara 8,21s I will never again curse the earth on account of mankind, though (?) the inclination of men's hearts is towards evil, from their earliest years; I will never again destroy all living things as I have done. From now on, as long as the earth lasts, seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall never cease. 11,6s Behold, these are one people, all having the same speech, and this is only the beginning of their undertakings. So now, nothing they may plan to do will be beyond their power. Come, let us go down and there confuse their speech, so that they cannot understand each other's speech. 18,20s The complaint against Sodom [ ] has become loud, and their crime is grievous indeed. I will go down and see if they are all acting accord- ing to the complaint I hear ; I will know for certain !9 Form of the Soliloquies The question first arises as to the formal nature of these passages. Has the Yahwist a fixed schema for these speeches, and if so, can we trace its origin? Fortunately, we have sufficient materials in Gn to answer both questions in the affirmative. He has taken over from the standard narrative style a fairly stereotyped construction, which appears elsewhere in the mouths of his human characters, normally at the beginning of a narrative unit, where it initiates an action or conflict. It has two parts, which we may label (a) motivation and (b) proposition: the speaker first (a) describes the situation, which is presented as the motive or reason for (b) the propo- sition, usually a command, request, or suggestion to his interlocutor. The first example is in 12,1 lss (Abraham) : "[a] Look, I know you are a beau- tiful woman, and it may happen that when the Egyptians see you they will say, 'She is his wife,' and kill me but spare you; [b] therefore, please say that you are my sister. . . ." Others are in 16,2 (Sarah) ; 19,31s (Lot's elder daughter) ; 27,2ss (Isaac) ; 27, 42ss (Rebecca) ; 37,26s (Judah) ; etc.10 A variant and simpler form is found in 25,30 (Esau) : "[b] Let me gulp down some of that red stuff there, [a] for I am famished." Here the proposition is put first, and the motivation is added as a subordinate causal clause. 9 The last phrase, we'îm lo' 'ēdaāh, is usually translated "or if not, I would know," or similarly. But surely this is the 'im lô' of asseveration, combined exceptionally with the cohortative : "I swear I will know !" Cf. G-K 108*, 149a, e. 10 The construction is found also m passages ascribed to the Priestly tradition (Gn 23,4; Abraham), and in the Elohist (41,39s; Pharaoh). (280)</page><page sequence="5">The Divine Soliloquies in Genesis 161 This pattern, which is sufficiently distinct to constitute a little genus litt er avium of its own, is simply transferred by the Yahwist to the divine Speaker. Since, however, in the passages we are considering, Yahweh does not request nor command anyone else to act - is, in fact, "speaking in His heart" (8,21) - the proposition takes the form of a resolution or self- exhortation.11 The three passages connected with the Flood story (6,3.7 ; 8,21) have the simpler form, in which the proposition is enunciated first, with emphasis, and the motivation follows as a causal clause. The other four have the more regular form, in which the motivation comes first. In 3,22, which ends in an aposiopesis, the proposition is left to be understood ; or rather it is supplied by the following 3rd person narrative phrase, whether this was originally v.23, or, as seems more likely, 24, "and He drove the Man out." Noteworthy is the specially close formal resemblance existing between 3,22 and ll,6s. In each, the motivation itself has two parts, the first in- troduced by hen , "behold," the second by we'attah, "so now." The former refers to what has come to pass, the latter to a further objectionable con- sequence, which will follow unless Yahweh intervenes; which He therefore does. Almost the identical construction occurs in Abraham's speech, 12,11s, quoted above. Doctrine of the Soliloquies Without trying to give a detailed exegesis of each of these passages, thus isolated, it may nevertheless be profitable, in the light of the foregoing, to investigate the doctrine that the Yahwist conveys in these interpretations of God's inmost thoughts. We may ask ourselves in each case, what would be missing if the soliloquy were omitted ? In the first passage, 2,18, the author is evidently preparing what is to be the climax of the creation of humanity.12 He did not find it necessary to ex- plain the divine motives in molding and vivifying the Man, in installing him in the garden, in forbidding him the use of the tree ; but he does wish to stress the purpose of the Woman's creation, and Yahweh's intention that she shall be a "help corresponding to" the Man. This suitability, and 11 The question as to the significance of the plural in 3,22 and 11,7 (and, accord- ing to LXX and Vg, in 2,18) may be passed over here. Even if the author thinks of Yahweh as addressing His heavenly ministers (which is by no means certain), the latter make no response and take no part in the following action. Equivalently, the speeches remain soliloquies. 12 Cf. McKenzie, in ThSt 15 (1954), 559: "It seems no exaggeration to say that the creation of woman is the climax towards which the whole preceding narrative tends." (281)</page><page sequence="6">162 In Honor of Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara equality of nature, are echoed in v.23, "Now, at last, this creature is bone of my bones. . . ." In view of the rather prevalent opinion that the creation of the animals is an unsuccessful experiment on the part of Yahweh-God, to see if any of them will make a suitable mate for the Man,13 I should like to suggest that this may very well have been its significance in the older material that the Yahwist was here using;14 but that one reason why he inserted v. 18 was precisely to correct that idea, and to make clear that Yahweh knew from the start what kind of helper the Man needed. Any of the animals might be a helper, ' ēzer , but not one corresponding to him, kenegdô. A second reason is to make explicit Yahweh-Goďs concern about what is good for man; He is not acting casually or without reflection, but is solicitous and careful to see that the Man has all he needs, not just ad esse but ad bene esse . This is in marked contrast, for instance, to Babylonian cosmogonies, where it is what is good for the gods that motivates the process of creation. In 3,22 we have Yahweh-Goďs private judgment on the Man's trans- gression, differing significantly from the motivating clauses prefixed to the public sentence in v. 17. It was enough, that the Man's guilt should be made clear to him in the elementary terms of disobedience; but the author uses this soliloquy to explain, by a combination of the Serpent's promise (3,5) with the quality of the tree named in 2,17, the deeper significance of dis- obedience to this Authority. I do not believe that this speech is merely, or mainly, ironical, as so many critics hold. "Knowledge of good and evil" is not mere passive experience; it is mastery of good and evil. In the con- crete, by deciding to treat as good something that Yahweh treated as evil (his eating from the tree), the Man has acted like a god; he has aped God, 13 This is the view - to name only two of the most influential critics - of Gunkel in the Göttingen Handkommentar , and Skinner in the ICC . Lagrange in his un- published commentary ( pro manuscripto , 1905) took a similar view: "Dieu . . . crée, à ce moment, les animaux, pour tenter avec eux l'expérience sur Adam." The latest Catholic commentator, Gelin (in the Pirot-Clamer Bible: Genèse , 1953), does not express himself clearly on the author's intention here. Junker in the Echter-Bibel ( Genesis , 1949; p. 16) bluntly disagrees: "Wer diesen Abschnitt [w. 18-20] als einen 'misslungenen Versuch' des Schöpfers deutet, verkennt den Zweck der Darstellung, die den Gedanken der Erhabenheit des Menschen über das Tier scharf und bestimmt hervorheben will." 14 "To see what he would call them," lir'ôt mah-yiqra-lô, is such an unusual Hebrew phrase (rã' ãh governing a vocal act) that I suspect the verb stood in the Vorlage with quite a different object: "to see whether any were like him," or some- thing of that kind. It is true, there is a parallel to this use of raãh in Jer 33,24. (282)</page><page sequence="7">The Divine Soliloquies in Genesis 163 and in this one respect he has made himself "like Elohim." But this has not made him like God in any other way, still less made him a god. By this attempted usurpation, this god-like action, he has corrupted his nature as man. Now, therefore, the other divine prerogative of immortality would be no blessing, but further corruption. The withdrawal of it, by banish- ment, is not merely a penalty, or drastic self-protection by a jealous divinity; it is also, as the Yahwist presents it, a compassionate safeguard for the Man himself.15 The divine verdict in 6,3 is too uncertain, both in text and context, for much to be drawn from it, without a long and thorough treatment of the whole pericope.16 We shall here note only that it somewhat resembles 3,22, in that it involves a limitation of the human life-span, decreed by Yah weh not as an arbitrary punishment but as the necessary consequence of some excess or transgression on the part of His creatures. If the transla- tion adopted above is correct, the speech has a notably compassionate tone, expressing vividly the divine condescension towards the weakness and little- ness of men. In contrast to the foregoing, 6,7 is the most severe and terrible of these divine musings. The motivation, "For I regret that I ever made them," is a summary of the preceding verses 5 and 6, which describe with unparalleled boldness the feelings of God's heart. Von Rad remarks that these verses are probably the first passage which is entirely the Yahwisťs own composi- tion, as opposed to revision and arrangement of already traditional material, found in the preceding chapters.17 If so, we have here further impressive testimony to our author's concept of Yah weh as a God of morality. This impassioned statement of the sanctity of Yahweh, and His revulsion at the sight of human depravity, anticipates the tone of the great prophets. Like them, the Yahwist shows here his profound realization of the enormity of sin. He does not hesitate to use anthropopathisms (grief and regret) as vigorous as those of Osee, which almost invite us to compassionate Yahweh in His disappointment. He has done so much for these creatures, and their 15 "Wir sollen doch auch erfahren, dass das strenge Wort von der Verweigerung des ewigen Lebens zugleich eine barmherzige Rückseite hat, nämlich die Vorenthal- tung eines Gutes, das von ihm in seinem nunmehrigen Lebenstand gar nicht zu tragen wäre." Von Rad, Das erste Buch Mose ( ATD 2; 1950), 79. 16 There is a good review of recent Catholic treatments of the subject by Fischer, "Deutung und literarische Art von Gen 61-4," in the Nötscher Festschrift (1950), 74-85. Fischer himself offers a compromise solution, which is hardly likely to prove satisfactory. 17 Op. cit., 95. It seems likely, however, that 2,18 was already an original contribu- tion by the Yahwist. (283)</page><page sequence="8">164 In Honor of Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara answer to His goodness is to outrage His justice. But that justice is in- escapable ; even though reluctantly, Yahweh must destroy His own creation. Hence the resolution, which is such a terrible reversal of the loving care with which the creation and equipment of mankind were carried out in ch. 2. The third of the Flood soliloquies, 8,21s, makes a striking contrast to the one just considered. The most natural meaning to be taken out of it, as it stands, is a compassionate excuse for man's future wrongdoing : it is not so much malice and rebellion as weakness and failure. There is a corruption innate in man, and when its natural results appear Yahweh will regard them as, if not altogether excusable, still deserving of His pity and help. But the contrast in the reasoning remains. The motivation is identical with the stern findings in 6,5b - even the terms are repeated, yêser, lēb, rď - but the propositions are exactly opposed. "Men's inclinations are all evil ; therefore I will destroy them" ; and, "therefore I will never again destroy them." This apparent contradiction may be softened if we take k% as having concessive force - see the translation above; but the puzzle remains of ex- plaining the opposite reactions to an identical situation. The only factor in the context that might seem to justify this would be Yahweh's satisfaction with Noah's holocaust. But in view of the Yahwist's usually detached attitude towards sacrifices, that can hardly be meant to carry such a weight of efficacy. Probably we should look further afield. The combination in Yahweh of justice and love - condemnation of sin, yet salvation for the sinner - tends to assume a fixed pattern in the OT. Justice is executed first, yet never completely or to the limit; love intervenes, to forgive and restore. It is this sequence that Isaias expresses with his doctrine of the Remnant, Jeremias with the New Covenant, Ezechiel with the hope held out to individuals. But we can discern it already in these two soliloquies that frame the Yahwist's presentation of the Flood, the prototype of divine judgments. A remnant is saved, and though the race they propagate is the same as before, yet Yahweh in the end is disposed to let mercy prevail over justice. 11,6s is Yahweh's verdict on the builders of Babel. The similarity of structure between this passage and 3,22 has already been noted. Naturally, there is a similarity of theme as well. The motif is again that of impious human ambitions; men are trying to act like gods, raising themselves by their own powers above their proper character and status as men. So far, they have taken only a first step, but if they are allowed to proceed un- checked the divinely established order will be perturbed. The idea that the gods jealously guard their prerogatives against human usurpation is one (284)</page><page sequence="9">The Divine Soliloquies in Genesis 165 that is essentially connected with the idea of the Sacred, and belongs to all religions in which personality is attributed to the divinity. But a distin- guishing mark of the Yah wist conception is the passionless, serenely ob- jective view taken by Yahweh ; the word "jealousy" must be stripped of its emotional connotations if it is to be applied to this supremely detached verdict. The first line of the motivation is a repetition of 11,1, a simple noting of a fact ; but the second and third phrases are prophetic, analyzing conse- quences that could hardly have been stated in ordinary narrative. The proposition (v.7) is partly an aetiological trait, showing that one point of the original story was an explanation of the different languages of mankind; but the Yahwist, as usual, has contrived to give far greater depth and meaning to it. For him, this breaking up of unity is not a natural development but a divinely decreed punishment, the withdrawal of a blessing which has been misused. The sharing of one language, the harmo- nious co-existence of all mankind as a single family, was something as contrary to human experience in the Yahwisťs time as it is today. Never- theless, he looks on it as something analogous to the paradisiac existence sketched in ch. 2, divinely intended at the first, but later forfeited because men abused it. This theme of the divisive effect of sin is a favorite one with our author; cf. in ch. 3 how the companion that was "bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh," becomes, after guilty complicity, "the Woman whom You placed at my side." Men can remain united with one another only so long as they are united to God. Finally, there is 18,20s, the last passage in which the Yahwist will exer- cise his prophetic prerogative of reading Goďs mind. It is not made clear who are the agents of the "complaint" mentioned: are they the divine messengers? or have deeds themselves, like innocent blood shed, a tongue and a voice to cry out in protest? Whatever the conception may be (pos- sibly the author himself had not thought it out), it is very evident that the crimes of the townsfolk do no injury to Yahweh. The men of Sodom are not bound to Him by any special covenant, and He is not personally affected by what they may do. Yet He deliberately concerns Himself with it, acting in His capacity of "Judge of all the earth." He is shown as having the qualities of the ideal judge. He is merciful by preference, not hasty to condemn ; He will investigate and know for certain. But if it is indeed so, then He will act, and drastically. The stress on "all" (reading kullãm, "if they are all acting . . .") prepares for the following dialogue with Abraham, and is answered by the stress in 19,4. Incidentally we may note here the "monotheism in action" so character- (285)</page><page sequence="10">166 In Honor of Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara istic of the Yahwisťs narrative. There is no suggestion that the inhabitants of the Pentapolis knew or worshipped Yahweh - rather the contrary. Yet Yahweh alone is concerned to judge and punish them; no other divinity is so much as hinted at.18 This cannot possibly be from ignorance. No matter what date we assign to the Yahwist, he lived in a milieu which was well acquainted with the gods of the Gentiles. Even in the time of the Judges, and still more under the monarchy, the Israelites were in continual contact with Arameans, Philistines, Moabites, Egyptians, Phoenicians, etc., not to mention the Canaanite populations in their midst. Nor can this utter ignoring of all other gods be mere naivete. Yahweh in these stories is vastly more than the God of a single people, or kingdom, or territory. He is Elohim, fully and exclusively ; there is no divinity left over, so to speak, to be shared by any rivals or colleagues. The theoretical doctrine of monothe- ism was no doubt of long development, but the practical outlook that implied it is fully present in these most ancient products of Israelite tradi- tion. Thus the Yahwist, operating with only the crudest equipment in terms of theological concepts and expressions, succeeds in communicating a theo- logical doctrine of unsurpassed sublimity and truth. These speeches, which convey with such simplicity and directness his insight into the character and mind of Yahweh, have and will always retain a power to reach men's hearts, unattainable by the more refined and scientific statements of later theoloe^. R. A. F. MacKenzie, S.J. Jesuit Seminary Toronto 18 This same implicit assertion of Yahweh's world-wide and exclusive dominion appears in the story of Abraham in Egypt (12,10-20).
