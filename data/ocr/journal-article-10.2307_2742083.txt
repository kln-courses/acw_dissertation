<plain_text><page sequence="1">On a Cognitive Theory of Religion by M. F. C. BOURDILLON Department of Sociology, University of Calabar, P.M.B. 1115, Calabar, Nigeria. 1 XI 79 Guthrie's (CA 21:181-94) attempt to define religion is uncon- vincing, and a critique of his definition puts limits on the ap- plicability of his theory of religion as anthropomorphism- which nevertheless does provide real insight into certain aspects of religion. Surely the relationship between the meaning of a word and its use has been long enough established to render unnecessary the futile search for a meaning which remains firmly attached to a word independently of its particular uses in their particular contexts. "Religion," for a modern man who is fully involved in scientific thinking and still finds religious language and practice appropriate in certain contexts, does not mean the same thing as it may for a man encapsulated in a small-scale society little influenced by science and technology. In the former case, the man's religion is likely to be kept clearly distinct from his science, each having distinct functions and cognitive methods. In the latter case, the explicit exploration of a distinction between religion and science comes only from outside observers and is likely to focus on the contrast between scientific thought and some kind of "primitive" (perhaps preliterate) thought rather than on the contrast between religion and science. Why and how a single definition and theory can cover religion in such diverse contexts needs at least to be considered. Guthrie dismisses using Tillich's notion of "ultimacy" to identify religion on the grounds that ultimacy can be defined only tautologously and that such a definition fails to distinguish between religion and philosophy. Yet for the purposes of some- one who, like Tillich, is trying to make positive sense of his religious tradition in the modern world, religion is precisely concerned with what he considers to be the ultimate conditions of existence (though others may dispute their reality or ulti- macy), and the distinction between philosophy and religion is not at all clear. Bellah's definition attempts to delineate a parallel institution cross-culturally, and it is recognisable to religious people in the modern world. Nevertheless, anthro- pologists studying social institutions in which they are not personally involved may wish for something more concrete to delineate their enquiries. To this end, anthropologists have produced a variety of definitions of religion, each of which suits the purposes of a particular study or type of study but none of which encompasses all the connotations of "religion." Horton (1960), whose influence Guthrie acknowledges, specifically states the uses of his definition. Guthrie does not indicate what purpose his own definition of religion serves. Guthrie's is clearly not a dictionary type of definition, simply describing the ways in which people use the term, since he points out that some people explicitly try to remove anthro- pomorphism from their religion, which they must therefore understand in some other way. There are in the modern world people who regard the religion they practice as a system of symbolic thought and action which helps them to control their behaviour, their social relations, and indeed their relationship with the universe they encounter. Their emphasis is not so much on a cognitive system as on a system of symbolic expression. Such a view of religion may be unusual in terms of the history of religions, but there seems no adequate reason that the symbolic system it entails should not be called "religion." A definition of religion as some kind of illusion cannot satisfy those who hold that religion is as close to reality as are other human institutions. Guthrie's definition points to a trait which is very common in relatively unsophisticated beliefs (religious and others), but his argument verges on the tautologous: he defines religion in a way that excludes anything that does not fit his theory of religion. When Guthrie moves on to analyse anthropomorphism as a phenomenon in various forms of cognition, his essay becomes more convincing. The widespread incidence of anthropomorph- ism is established, and it helps us to understand much religious cognition. Nevertheless, the relationship between anthropo- morphism (which for Guthrie seems indistinct from personifica- tion) in religion and in, say, poetry needs further consideration. Guthrie seems to hold that specifically religious anthropo- morphism is unconsciously extended beyond its legitimate limits and to this extent is illusory (the relationship between religion and magic in his view is not clear). This suggests a limited concept of religion-limited by the author's definition. In the study of any particular religious system, the question remains whether the anthropomorphism it contains is the most central, or the most interesting, aspect of it. by WAUTHIER DE MAHIEU Center for Social and Cultural Anthropology, Catholic Univer- sity of Leuven, Tiensestraat 102, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium. 28 x 79 Pour autant que la religion soit a considere comme un module explicatif de la r~alit(~, l'article, qui vise &amp; rendre compte du phemomene religieux, constitue, en quelque sorte, un module d'un modgle, et un module qui, comme celui qu'il explique, peut trouver sa place g c6t~ d'autres, sans que rien n'en marque le caractere absolu ou universel, si ce n'est le d~sir de son auteur qu'il en soit ainsi.

Vol. 21 ? No. 4 ? August 1980 535</page><page sequence="2">Notre propre experience anthropologique nous a fait de- couvrir que le phenomene religieux se per?oit en premier lieu dans l'activite symbolique et rituelle, et, a partir de la, dans le systeme de pensee mis en oeuvre par celle-ci. On remarque alors que ce dernier systeme se meut ailleurs que dans le domaine des raisonnements serres concernant les causalites techniques et immediates. II ne peut donc ni etre simplement mis en parallele avec d'autres modeles explicatifs ou operatoires, ni etre situe dans le prolongement de ceux-ci. De ce fait il presente une dimension specifique, celle d'une ouverture vers autre chose, d'une attitude ((en creux)). C'est ce creux qui se trouvera frequemment comble de maniere metaphorique ou anthropomorphique. Ainsi, la notion d'ambiguous, clef du raisonnement de l'auteur (P1 et D2), garde quelque chose d'ambigu. Permettant de recuperer les questions plus fondamentales et de situer tous les phenomenes a expliquer sur un meme niveau, elle mene l'auteur a faire de l'anthropomorphisme le principe d'un type d'inter- pr'tation qui constitue l'essence du phenomene religieux, alors que cet anthropomorphisme ne nous paralt etre qu'une qualifi- cation d'un phenomene dont l'essence se trouve ailleurs. [If religion can be considered an explanatory model of reality, Guthrie's article, which attempts to account for the phenom- enon of religion, is, in a way, a model of a model. Furthermore, like that which it explains, it is a model which can be placed alongside other models without anything to denote its absolute or universal character except its author's own wish. In its rigorous and authoritative argumentation, Guthrie's model can indeed fulfill a certain need for theories on the subject. I do not believe, however, that the anthropologist who tries to grasp the phenomenon from within (i.e., as a system of meanings created and worked out by the bearers of a culture) will find this model very satisfactory. It will be even less satisfactory to the bearers of that culture themselves, even if the most reasonable amongst them are willing to recognize, as did Thomas Aquinas, whom the author mentions, the anthro- pomorphic dimension of their religious representations. My own anthropological experiences have led me to see that the phenomenon of religion is perceived primarily in symbolic and ritual activity and hence in the system of thought brought into play through that. One notices that this system of thought operates elsewhere than in the domain of strong arguments concerning technical and immediate causalities. One cannot thus simply draw a parallel between it and other operative and explanatory models, nor can it be seen as a mere extension of these. In fact, it presents a specific dimension, that of an opening up towards something else, an attitude of receptive- ness. It is this receptiveness which is frequently found filled up with metaphoric and anthropomorphic elements. Thus the idea of the ambiguous, the key to the author's argument (P1 and D2), remains itself somewhat ambiguous. While this notion permits the author to cover the most funda- mental questions and to reduce all the phenomena which require explanation to a common denominator, it also leads him to turn anthropomorphism into the basis for a type of interpretation of what constitutes the phenomenon of religion. This anthropomorphism, however, seems to me to be nothing more than one aspect of a phenomenon the essence of which lies elsewhere.] by K. N. SAHAY Department of Anthropology, Ranchi University, Ranchi 834001, India. 20 x 79 Guthrie throws fresh light on some aspects of religion by show- ing that religion is a special case of a general phenomenon called anthropomorphism. Further, he sees no fundamental disjunc- tion between religious and nonreligious modes of thought, though their contents may be different. It seems to me that while anthropomorphism is obviously a prominent feature in many religions, it may not be universal. Muslims seem to detest attributing anthropomorphic features to their god, and the position of Buddhists may not be much different. Secondly, it is not clear, if there is no fundamental disjunction between religious and no6nreligious modes of thought, how we are to account for the element of supernaturalism in religion. Thirdly, if the statement "Religion credits the nonhuman world with speaking a language, and magic credits it with sending and receiving calls" (p. 190) is true, how are we io explain the recitation of lengthy mantras (spells), addressed to super- natural forces, in magical conjurings in countries like India? True, in some forms of magic occult words have inherent magical power which acts automatically, but this may not be the case with all types of magic. by JULIO TERAJN-DUTARI Pontificia Universidad Cat6lica del Ecuador, Casilla 2184, Quito, Ecuador. 11 x 79 Concuerdo con Guthrie en la tendencia general a buscar para la religion una definicion racional, intelectualista pero no funcionalista, que abarque las diversas culturas. Apruebo que su proceder parta de una teoria del conocimiento fundada en la ambigiiedad de los fenomenos percibidos. Esta teoria nos acerca mucho al valioso principio ((conocer es interpretarn, y da importancia a la analogia en el uso de modelos interpreta- tivos, preferentemente humanos. Puedo admitir tambien el aserto principal, que en la religion se da una aplicacion sistematica de modelos humanos a feno- menos que no son propiamente humanos, pero con dos reservas sustanciales: 1. Este aserto vale del aspecto teorico de la religion (como conjunto de ((creencias))), que para ml no es el aspecto funda- mental, y sefiala en el un rasgo muy importante (aunque habria que discutir si es el mas significativo de todos). Personalmente no creo que la religion sea en su esencia un intento de explicar y controlar fenomenos referentes al mundo en general, un sistema de pensamiento que solo consecuente- mente lleve a la accion. Opino, con muchos filosofos de la religion, que lo mas caracteristico de esta consiste en fenomenos de un tipo especial, los cuales a su vez se perciben por un tipo de conocimiento especial, aunque relacionado organicamente con el conjunto de nuestros conocimientos: la experiencia religiosa. El fenomeno religioso tiene una estructura fundamentalmente identica a traves de sus m(ultiples formas historicas que varian de acuerdo con las mediaciones culturales. Estas diversas mediaciones intervienen tambien en el modo como las personas implicadas en la experiencia religiosa organizan sistemas sociales que posibiliten y promuevan esta misma experiencia, con su consiguiente influjo sobre la vida individual y colectiva. Las mediaciones culturales determinan ademas el que existan m(ulti- ples interpretaciones del fenomeno religioso y de su experiencia, ya sea al interior de cada forma historicamente organizada de religion (en sus propias ((creencias))), ya tambien dentro de las teorias de quienes estudian desde fuera estas formas de religion. 2. Si el aserto principal de Guthrie se expresa como ((antro- pomorfismo)), no puedo aceptar la interpretacion dada por el a este termino en el sentido de que el conocimiento religioso, aunque persistente, justificado, racional y homogeneo respecto del conocimiento cientifico, es ((errado por definicion)). El error pareceria estar en que a un fenomeno que no es propiamente humano se le aplica un modelo interpretativo humano. Pero este proceder no implica contradicci6n ni falta ninguna de l6gica si se funda en la analogia, explicada por teologos y fil6sofos cristianos, al menos desde Tomas de Aquino 536 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">(a quien Guthrie menciona pero no cita). Para ser valida, esta analogia requiere dos supuestos: a) Aquel hecho de caracteristicas propias dado en el feno- meno religioso, tiene que ver con lo humano (en su ((ultimate concern)): Tillich), pero tiene que ser algo realmente distinto de lo humano. Nada permite concluir a priori que este primer supuesto nunca se cumple. b) Aquello ((realmente distinto de lo humano)) debe presentar sin embargo una semejanza objetiva con lo humano, en medio de una desemejanza. Esta proporcion de ((semejanza mias desemejanza)) debe ser tal que no pueda reducirse ni a un termino simplemente equivoco, que se aplica de modo diverso a las dos realidades, ni a un termino simplemente univoco, que se aplica de modo identico a ellas. Este segundo supuesto es precisamente lo que se expresa en la pretension de muchas creencias religiosas al interpretar ciertos fenomenos como per- tenecientes ((en alguna manera)) a un sistema de intercomunica- cion personal. Por supuesto, esta pretension sola no decide acerca de la autenticidad de esas creencias religiosas. En consecuencia debe examinarse cada vez si de hecho se cumplen estos dos supuestos de la analogia para poder juzgar sobre la verdad del conoci- miento religioso. Una definicion cientifica de religion debe, en cambio, abarcar empiricamente todos aquellos fenomenos que aparecen como religiosos; pero ha de dejar fuera la cuestion, que debe esclarecerse en cada caso, sobre la verdad o falsedad de la teoria religiosa anexa a cada fenomeno o grupo de fe- nomenos. [I share with Guthrie the general tendency to look for a rational definition of religion, intellectualist but not functionalist, which can encompass diverse cultures. I like the fact that his method stems from a theory of knowledge based on the ambiguity of perceived phenomena. This theory comes close to the valuable principle "to know is to interpret" and emphasizes analogy in the use of interpretive models, preferably human. I can also accept the main assertion that in religion one finds a systematic application of human models to phenomena which are not properly human, with two substantive reservations: 1. This assertion applies to the theoretical aspect of religion (as a set of "beliefs"), which to me is not the main aspect, and indicates a very important feature of it (although one could argue whether it is the most significant). Personally, I do not believe that religion is in essence an attempt to explain and control phenomena related to the world in general, a system of thought that only leads to action as a consequence. With many philosophers of religion, I think that the main characteristic of religion is phenomena of a special type, perceived by a special type of knowledge that is nevertheless organically related to the rest of our knowledge: the religious experience. The religious phenomenon has a fundamentally identical structure throughout its multiple historical forms, which vary according to cultural mediations. These different mediations also intervene in the way in which persons involved in religious experience organize social systems that make possible and promote this experience, with its consequent influence on individual and collective life. Furthermore, cultural mediations determine the existence of multiple interpretations of the religious phenomenon and its experience, either within each historically organized form of religion (in its own "beliefs") or within the theories propounded by outside students of these forms of religion. 2. If Guthrie's main assertion is expressed as "anthropo- morphism," I cannot accept his interpretation of this term to mean that religious knowledge, although persistent, justified, rational, and homogeneous in relation to scientific knowledge, is "by definition mistaken." The mistake would seem to lie in the application of an interpretive human model to a phenomenon which is not properly human. This procedure, however, does not imply any contradiction or logical fault if it is based on analogy, as ex- plained by Christian theologians and philosophers since at least Thomas Aquinas (mentioned but not quoted by Guthrie). To be valid, this analogy requires two conditions: a) That fact with particular characteristics given in the religious phenomenon has to do with the human (in its "ulti- mate concern": Tillich), but it has to be something really different from the human. Nothing allows us to conclude a priori that this first condition is never fulfilled. b) That which is "really different from the human" must nevertheless present an objective similarity to the human in the midst of dissimilarity. This proportion of "similarity plus dissimilarity" must not be reduced either to a simply equivocal term, which is applied in a different form to the two realities, or to a simply univocal term, which is applied to both realities in identical fashion. This second condition is precisely expressed in the attempt of many religious beliefs to interpret certain phenomena as belonging "in some way" to a system of personal intercommunication. It is obvious that, on its own, this attempt is not decisive as to the authenticity of those religious beliefs. Accordingly, one must examine each time if the two analogy conditions are fulfilled in practice, in order to judge the truth of religious knowledge. On the contrary, a scientific definition of religion must encompass empirically all those phenomena which appear as religious, but it must leave out the question-to be clarified in each case-of the truth or falsehood of the religious theory attached to each phenomenon or group of phenomena.] Reply by STEWART GUTHRIE Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, R.I. 02881, U.S.A. i1 TII 80 Bourdillon's central objections seem to be (1) that a general anthropological definition of religion is both unnecessary and futile, (2) that I have not said what purposes my definition might serve, and (3) that my definition verges on the tautolo- gous. None of these seems to me to be justified. His claim that a search for a general definition of religion is futile is based on the assertions that the meaning of a word depends upon usage and context and that the word "religion" will be used differently by a "modern man" and by a man in a "small-scale society." Both assertions seem true (if indeed one can assume that the latter man will use the term at all), but they do not affect my essay. I have not attempted a definition that is at once cross-cultural (etic) and local (emic), which would indeed be futile, but only the former. I have tried to establish an anthropological definition in the context of a particular anthropological theory. As for Bourdillon's view that definitions are unnecessary because usage sufficiently establishes meaning, I would point out that anthropologists use the term in question in many ways. This fact indicates that no unified context of usage (or of theory, which tacitly or explicitly must underlie usage) has hitherto emerged. As I noted in the article, there are writers other than Bourdillon who think no definition necessary. As Horton (1960) points out, this position simply requires them to use ad hoc or tacit definitions; but if they do not give their major terms explicit or systematic definitions-even provisional ones-they are in a poor position to use them in research. Since anthropology is the enterprise of cultural comparison, it requires terms so defined as to be cross-culturally applicable. Vol. 21 * No. 4 * August 1980 537</page><page sequence="4">The context of usage is anthropology itself, not individual cultures. This leads to his second major objection, that I have not said what purpose my definition serves. In fact, I have (p. 184), naming among others the purpose of leading to an epistemology in which religious models are similar in construction and use to other models. A last objection is that my definition "verges on the tautol- ogous" because it excludes anything not fitting my theory of religion. Since the purpose of definition is to establish meanings, in part by excluding other possible meanings, and since, as Horton (1960) points out, a useful definition is part of a consistent theory, I think that the relation between definition and theory here might better be called "coherent." If Bourdillon wished to show that it is tautologous, he would need to show that it is true merely by virtue of the meanings of component terms, i.e., that at least one of the terms used itself must be defined in a way similar to the original term. This is not the case here. If what he really means to say is that the definition empirically excludes too much, he needs to mention some phenomenon that he wants to call "religious" which does not fit the definition. De Mahieu thinks my argument, though rigorous and au- thoritative, prospectively unsatisfactory both to religious be- lievers and to anthropologists. I agree that it must be unsatis- factory to believers, since it explains religion in large part as a kind of illusion. However, I do not see why it should be unsatis- factory to anthropologists. De Mahieu says that religion cannot be compared (as I hold it can) to other kinds of models, because it is not concerned with technical or immediate causality and because what it really consists in is an "attitude of receptive- ness." There are three problems here. First, I do not think it true that religion is unconcerned with technique or causality- witness prayers for skill in crafts, for success in examinations, for military victory, or for rain, and witness also interpreta- tions of natural phenomena such as floods and plagues as immediately caused by a punitive god. Second, even if its topic and aims were always different from those of other sets of models such as biology or geology (and its history of conflict with these fields in the West suggests that they are not), that would not mean that "one cannot . . . draw a parallel between it and other operative and explicatory models," any more than a difference of topic means that no parallel can be drawn be- tween mathematics and chemistry or between physics and music. Last, de Mahieu's characterization of religion as an "attitude of receptiveness" seems too broad a stroke. Who is receptive, and, more importantly, to what? Does this criterion mean that the physicist is religious if receptive to new facts, phe- nomena, or ideas? Does it mean that the orthodox believer is unreligious if unreceptive to new beliefs? Such conclusions are unsatisfactory but seem to be plausible inferences from this criterion. Sahay's first objection to my proposals is that Buddhists and Moslems may explicitly avoid anthropomorphism in de- scribing their gods. To be sure, they may try to avoid it, but they do not (and, for reasons advanced by Palmer [1973], Nielsen [1974], Barbour [1974], and Meynell [1977], cannot) succeed-witness the fact that they pray, and expect to be heard and understood. Unless we agree with them that some nonhuman agency hears and understands prayer, we must call their attitude anthropomorphic: it attributes a capacity for language-a human characteristic-to the nonhuman world. Second, Sahay wishes to know how, if religious and nonreli- gious thought are fundamentally similar, we can account for religious supernaturalism. Since he does not indicate how he is dissatisfied with my treatment of this question in the article (p. 185) I do not know in what way to expand it. Third, he confronts my contrast of religion and magic, as using language and call systems respectively, with the Indian use of lengthy mantras in magical spells. I see no contradiction here, since calls can consist of lengthy utterances as well as short ones; that is merely a matter of degree. It is their fixed and automatic nature and their corresponding lack of produc- tivity, not their length, that sets them off from language. Finally, I am pleased that Teran-Dutari accepts my major assertions, which he summarizes accurately. His two reserva- tions, as I understand them, are his beliefs (1) that religion essentially is not an attempt to explain and control phenomena in general, but concerns "phenomena of a special type, per- ceived by a special type of knowledge," and (2) that anthro- pomorphism is not necessarily mistaken. I shall not try to respond to the first point, since I do not know how the special types of phenomena and knowledge with which he identifies religion differ from nonreligious phenomena and knowledge. In his second and, to me, more understandable reservation, he notes that anthropomorphism is based on analogy and points out, correctly I think, that we cannot know a priori whether a particular analogy will be justified or not. He con- cludes that anthropomorphism may be justified and that the question of the truth or falsity of particular anthropomorphic religious doctrines must await scrutiny for the presence or absence of conditions that validate analogy. This is a classic argument, dating at least from Aquinas, but still is unconvinc- ing. What I have argued is not that all analogies between humans and nonhumans are misled (many in fact are justified), but rather that some of them are. It is the latter that I call "anthropomorphic," following the convention (e.g., in Webster's Third New International Dictionary) that "anthropomorphism" interprets nonhuman things in terms of human characteristics. What is characteristic of humans is by definition not charac- teristic of nonhumans, which implies that an "anthropomor- phic" analogy is a mistaken or unjustified analogy. This would be merely circular if one were not prepared to say which char- acteristics are in fact specifically human ones. This is the crux of the matter, at once difficult, debatable, and perennially open to new evidence, as Terfan-Dutari recognizes. I have argued that the chief human characteristic, whose attribution to the nonhuman world we may label "religious," is language and associated symbolic capacities. It may of course still turn out that the nonhuman world, in some important part such as gods or God, is indeed so organized as to hear and understand prayer and to undertake symbolic action itself. If that is the case, then, as Terfan-Dutari and others suggest, the crucial analogy is justified; it is not anthropomorphic. Many people think that it is the case, on the apparently empirical grounds that they or others think that they have communicated, linguistically or paralinguistically, with the nonhuman world (e.g., with gods). My survey of anthropomorphism in other aspects of human cognition, however, undermines such a belief by showing that the tendency to find human features in nonhuman things is extremely general and by suggesting that such ostensible communication, systematic or not, is another instance of that tendency.
