Yet he was also figured as detached from nature, elevated above immedi- ate instincts and sensations to a higher, intellectual plain. These opposing figurations  were thrown into sharp relief when expeditionary zoologists narrated their experi- ences in travel memoirs. Their interspecies encounters were often highly emotional  experiences, which seemed (for them, at least) to narrow the boundaries between  humans and animals. However, zoologists also frequently tried to downplay or dismiss  such affective experiences in order to bolster their credibility as objective observers. I  argue that this conflict arose from different configurations of masculinity that framed  men as alternately inside and outside of nature. Zoology was a popular pastime in mid-nineteenth-century Britain that attracted enthu- siasts of many social classes and both genders. Nonetheless, authority over zoology  as a body of knowledge was generally vested in a small group of educated, middle- to  upper-class “men of science” affiliated with institutions such as the Linnean Society of  London.2 These men were usually able to devote themselves to zoology through inher- ited wealth, or particular work such as museum curating or capturing specimens for  private collectors. Among such men was a still smaller class of expeditionary research- ers who visited remote, faraway lands and brought back new knowledge of animal life.  Their work was heavily gendered in the Victorian imagination, associated with the  masculine traits of courage, determination, and self-possession, as well as physical  strength and endurance. The novelist Charles Kingsley wrote that the roving zoologist  must be like “the perfect knight-errant of the Middle Ages”: “strong in body,” “brave  and enterprising, and withal patient and undaunted” (1855, 39–40). 1 The research for this article was completed thanks to an Early Career Fellowship funded by the Leverhulme  Trust. I am also grateful to Sherilyn MacGregor, Nicole Seymour, and Kathryn de Luna for their help.  2 This term was distinct from “scientists,” which did not enter into frequent use until the late nineteenth  century (White 2002). </page> <page sequence="2"> 62 RCC Perspectives: Transformations The tensions within this dis- course of zoological mascu- linity remain largely unex- plored, though, particularly  regarding emotions. Previous  research has shown how, in  Western culture, women have  frequently been linked with  nature and animals through  Figure 1: their supposed emotionality   An engraving of a  “disappointed and sulky” (Plumwood 1993, 19–21; Lutz  chimpanzee by T.

The converse  The Expression of the  Emotions in Man and image of such primal, emo- Animals (London: John  Murray, 1872), 141. tional femininity was the as- sociation of masculinity with  detached, self-controlled rationality (Forth 2008, 30–1). Yet this model was opposed  in the Victorian period by what Bradley Deane (2008) calls “primitive masculinity,”  which located manliness primarily in bodily strength and instincts. Such masculinity  (hinted at in Kingsley’s muscular zoologist) dovetailed with imperialist ideology by  framing white men as vigorous conquerors, even as it undermined their supposed  intellectual superiority over their “barbarian” antagonists. I argue that while the ra- tionalist model characterized masculinity by restraint of emotions, the primitive one  viewed certain emotions (such as the excitement of the hunt) as the essence of mascu- linity. As a literary scholar, I will illustrate this tension through textual close readings  of travel memoirs by two of the most famous expeditionary zoologists of the period:  Charles Darwin’s Journal of Researches (1845) and Alfred Russel Wallace’s The Malay  Archipelago (1869). Since philosophers first defined them in the early nineteenth century, emotions had  been imagined as linking humans with animals. Unlike earlier, more ambiguous cat- egories of feeling, “emotions” were strictly separate from human intellect (see Dixon  2003). For zoologists, emotions such as hunting fever might be seen as a resource  for understanding the commonalities between humans and other animals. Reflecting  on his experiences of hunting in South America, Darwin commented that “the love of  the chase is an inherent delight in man—a relic of an instinctive passion” (1845, 505).  </page> <page sequence="3"> Men and Nature 63 Darwin would draw on his experiences with animals to argue that humans shared ba- sic emotions with them in his 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and  Animals. Yet masculine science was also imagined as rationally unemotional. In the  words of the physicist John Tyndall (after whom the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change  Research is now named), the man of science was characterized by “self-renunciation”  and “loyal surrender of himself to Nature and to the facts” (1854, 308).3 This conflict can be seen in Darwin’s memoir, which vacillates between celebrating the  ecstasy of hunting, and stressing the zoologist’s detachment from such emotions. Com- menting on his experience of men’s instinctive “love of the chase,” Darwin reflects that  such feelings constitute “the savage returning to his wild and native habits. I always  look back to our boat cruises, and my land journeys, when through unfrequented coun- tries, with a kind of extreme delight, which no scenes of civilization could have created”  (1845, 505). However, Darwin hesitates to dwell too long on this ecstasy, listing reasons  “of a more reasonable nature” (506) for zoologists to travel the world, such as broaden- ing their knowledge. Similarly, Darwin’s hunting anecdotes often emphasize his self- restraint as he stops short of killing creatures and tests their behaviors instead. Noting  the lack of fear and defensive ingenuity among gannets and terns on an Atlantic islet, he  writes, “Both are of a tame and stupid disposition, and are so unaccustomed to visitors,  that I could have killed any number of them with my geological hammer” (10). Darwin’s  use of the subjunctive (“I could have”) highlights his suppression of his violent impulses.  While his imagined savage would have indulged his bloodlust, the man of science in him  seeks to discover the unseen causes of the birds’ tameness, theorizing that geographic  isolation has eroded their defensive instincts. Later, he repeatedly catches and then re- leases a lizard to test whether it can adapt its habits to evade threats. Darwin’s narrative  contains many references to native South Americans’ hunting methods, some of which  he adopts for obtaining specimens; but only he, the Western man of science, pursues  animals to experiment upon them. Darwin also distances himself from the primitive emotions involved in hunting by  avoiding detailed descriptions of slaughter. He skirts over encounters with individual  animals, instead generalizing species-typical behavior. For example, he only briefly  3 On the development of scientific ideals of objectivity, see Daston and Galison (2007). </page> <page sequence="4"> 64 RCC Perspectives: Transformations mentions his hunting of Uruguayan deer to reinforce his argument that such creatures  have been conditioned to fear humans on horseback but not on foot. Darwin writes, “If  a person crawling close along the ground, slowly advances towards a herd, the deer  frequently, out of curiosity, approach to reconnoitre him. I have by this means killed,  from one spot, three out of the same herd” (48). He later abstracts to an even higher  level when referring to his bird shootings in the Falklands and Galapagos islands.  Darwin compares the relative timidity and brazenness of different species, and the dif- ferences between his experience hunting them and those of another traveler a century  earlier. While his predecessor reported that many birds were easily killed, Darwin  finds them more elusive, suggesting that they have “learnt caution” of humans. He  concludes that instinctive fear develops gradually over generations, writing: “We may  infer from these facts, what havoc the introduction of any new beast of prey must  cause in a country, before the instincts of the indigenous inhabitants become adapted  to the stranger’s craft or power” (401). Darwin’s choice of words highlights his perfor- mance of scientific detachment. His grand theory of species change eclipses the many,  individual acts of killing upon which it was built. A similar narrative strategy of downplaying the emotions involved in hunting is dis- cernible in Wallace’s Malay Archipelago. Wallace’s dramatic anecdotes of hunting  orang-utans always portray him as unflappably calm in pursuit of his prey. The zoolo- gist’s self-possession is emphasized by the contrasting discomposure of others, such  as his young assistant Charley. Recalling one day when Charley came to alert him of  an orang-utan nearby, Wallace writes that the boy rushed in out of breath with running and excitement, and exclaimed, interrupted by  gasps, “Get the gun, sir,—be quick,—such a large Mias!” “Where is it?” I asked, taking hold of my gun as I spoke . . . Two Dyaks chanced to  be in the house at the time, so I called them to accompany me, and started off, tell- ing Charley to bring all the ammunition after me as soon as possible.  (1869, 72)  Charley’s broken speech is opposed by Wallace’s pointed questioning, quick organiza- tion, and forethought. As he pursues the orang-utan through dense vegetation, Wal- lace’s calmness is again highlighted by the contrasting reaction of Chinese workers  who “were shouting their astonishment with open mouth: ‘Ya Ya, Tuan; Orang-utan,  </page> <page sequence="5"> Men and Nature 65 Tuan’” (74). After shooting the creature, Wallace instructs his native Dyak servants  to cut down the tree that holds the body; “but they were afraid, saying he was not  dead, and would come and attack them” (75). Wallace further reinforces the natives’  closeness to animal nature (and hence their emotionality) with the book’s frontispiece  illustration, which depicts another scene in which a Dyak wrestles with an attacking  orang-utan (fig. 2). Thus, Wallace accentuates his detachment from nature by present- ing others around him as contrastingly embedded in animal environments and unable  to control their primitive feelings. In these hunting scenes, Wallace in- dicates no feelings of sympathy for  the orang-utans, and moves the nar- rative swiftly onto his preparation of  their skins and skeletons for display.  Such ruthlessness was to be ex- pected in the narrative of a practical  zoologist concerned with obtaining  specimens. Nevertheless, Wallace’s  emotional orientation towards the  orang-utans changes dramatically  when he kills a mother and decides  to nurse its surviving infant. Feeding  and playing with the creature over  several months, Wallace comes to  view the orang-utan in almost human  terms. He observes that it sucked his Figure 2.

(London:  Macmillan &amp; Co., 1869),  baby in similar circumstances” (66). II, v. Wallace’s language shows how his  emotional life becomes entwined with that of the infant as he narrates his efforts to  quell its crying. Having made “an artificial mother” out of buffalo skin, which the in- fant could grip onto, Wallace comments, “I was now in hopes that I had made the little  orphan quite happy.” Like an affectionate parent, he finds that, when spoon-feeding  the creature, “it was a never-failing amusement to observe the curious changes of  </page> <page sequence="6"> 66 RCC Perspectives: Transformations countenance by which it would ex- press its approval or dislike of what  was given to it” (68). The anthro- pomorphism becomes increasingly  pronounced as Wallace describes  the infant’s tantrums not as similar to  but “exactly like a baby in a passion”  (69). When the young orang-utan  Figure 3. sickens and dies, Wallace describes  Frontispiece illustra- tion in Alfred Russel the event as a minor bereavement,  Wallace, The Malay  Archipelago, 2 vols. writing, “I much regretted the loss  (London: Macmillan &amp;  Co., 1869), I, iv. of my little pet, which I had at one  time looked forward to bringing up  to years of maturity, and taking home to England. For several months it had afforded  me daily amusement by its curious ways and the inimitably ludicrous expression of its  little countenance” (71, see fig. 3). Despite these statements, however, in the follow- ing paragraph, Wallace is again out shooting orang-utans with apparent composure.  Living alongside the creature in the domestic interior of the hut enables Wallace to  engage in the emotions of love and sympathy, which are wholly suppressed while  hunting outside in the forest. This tonal dissonance suggests an uncertainty for Wal- lace about the role of emotions in his identity as a zoologist. Like the thrill of hunting  for Darwin, Wallace’s affection for his pet suggests that emotion has a place in sci- entific masculinity, helping zoologists to explore possible overlaps between human  and animal. Yet Wallace’s authority as an objective “man of science” also depends  on his suppressing this emotion and, so, reasserting his distance from nature and the  animals it contains. Darwin and Wallace’s emotionally ambivalent anecdotes of encounters with wild ani- mals magnify the contradictions in Victorian attitudes to masculinity and nature, and  Victorian men’s attitudes towards nature. The zoologists vacillated between present- ing themselves as highly emotional beings—swept up in predaceous excitement and  anthropomorphic sympathy—and, conversely, cool, intellectual observers, detached  from the wildlife they studied. This instability was echoed in a clash of literary modes  as the authors veered in their writing between the objective facts and abstract theories  of science and the subjective experiences of autobiography. Similarly, as wild environ- </page> <page sequence="7"> Men and Nature 67 ments were liminal spaces without clear demarcations, the zoologist’s travel memoir  was a liminal genre in which highly charged emotional narrative sat side by side with  rarefied theoretical discussion, and opposing visions of the “man of science” collided.
