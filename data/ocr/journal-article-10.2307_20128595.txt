<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE AND TELEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF NATURE JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI ? HE SAME philosophical ideas often become the object of ex tremely diverse opinions. When Leibniz presented his idea of "pos sible worlds," Voltaire used the occasion for an ironic comment on "metaphysico-theologo-cosmology," whereas for P. L. M. de Mau pertuis it was an idea that inspired his important discoveries in the domain of mathematical analysis of dynamic systems. Similar differences of opinion appear today in discussions on the so-called Anthropic Principle. Unequivalent variants of this principle state the existence of close links between the appearance of carbon-based life and the cosmological structure of the universe, between the laws of cosmic evolution and values of physical constants. Many authors question the philosophical significance of the Anthropic Principle, regarding the principle as the product of arbitrary specu lations. Their philosophical opponents try to show that certain versions of the principle, which do not go beyond generalization of empirical data, provide grounds for solid teleological assertions claiming that the appearance of the human observer is the goal of cosmic evolution.1 After indicating essential differences in the status of main variants of the Anthropic Principle, I develop in the article a criti cal evaluation of the possibility of using this principle to work out new forms of the Design Argument. At the same time, though, I believe that the so-called weak variant of the Anthropic Principle2 discloses important regularities of cosmic evolution that have un questionable ontological significance. 1 See, for instance, P.

ZYCINSKI I The expression "Anthropic Principle" was used for the first time by Brandon Carter in 1973. During a Copernican conference in Cracow, he advanced the thesis that the position of the earthly observer in the universe is privileged in the sense that the develop ment of living organisms could not take place in any physical con ditions, but required special conditions dependent on such proper ties of the universe as age, rate of expansion, and the values of particular parameters.3 Cosmologists for a long time have been intrigued by the question of why life appeared so late in a universe which has been expanding for 20 billion years, and why the density of matter in the universe is so small that successive generations continually relive Pascalian anxiety in their experience of the emp tiness of infinite spaces. Modern cosmology supplies a partial ex planation. Even if life were to develop in only one place, a large and old universe would have been required. Billions of years of cosmic evolution are necessary for the appearance of carbon pro ducing stars, an indispensable element for the rise of known forms of life. The natural consequence of expansion lasting billions of years is the observed size of the universe. If expansion were taking place much more rapidly, systems like our solar system would be unstable and life could not have developed in its present forms. On the other hand, if expansion were taking place much more slowly, the evolution of stars would make impossible the appearance of carbon compounds since hydrogen would be burned up before the physical conditions required for the development of life came into being. The rate of expansion, in turn, is dependent on the density of matter in space. Today we know that Pascal's dread has its source in the observed density of matter in the universe, which is lower by 30 orders than the density of water. Yet if the density of matter were considerably greater than 10"30 g/cm3, the expanding universe would recollapse so rapidly that conditions for the development of life would not have enough time to appear. With the density of matter much smaller than 10"30, expansion would take place so 3 Brandon Carter, "Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology," in Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data, ?d.

These coincidences in parameters point to intriguing interde pendencies between the existence of living organisms and the physi cal and cosmological structure of the universe. These interdepen dences were studied before Carter, in the 1950s, by G. Whitrow, G. Idlis, and R. H. Dicke.4 The latter in his works appealed to P. A. M. Dirac's Large Numbers Hypothesis. Its version presented in 1937 emphasized that the number 1040 appears very often as a ratio between parameters characteristic both of phenomena of the mi croworld and of gravitational interactions. The presence of this number inspired new forms of neo-Pythagorean conjectures on the role of mathematical relations in the physical structure of the world. Attempts to answer new questions led to Dirac's research program which allows for changeability in time of some parameters previously regarded as constant. New versions of this program are still being developed in physics, and definitive conclusions about them would be premature.5 On the other hand, the critical evaluation of A. Eddington's numerological speculations, to which Dirac?formally rather than essentially?referred to in his program, seems justified. The au thor of The Theory of the Expanding Universe made an attempt in the twenties to construct a cosmological model whose structure would be determined by combinations of six of the following param eters: c, the velocity of light; G, the gravitational constant; h, Planck's constant; me, electron mass; mN, proton mass; e, electron charge. Some of Eddington's interdependencies were extremely artificial and resulted from the arbitrary introduction of artificial combinations of parameters. Max Born, who was known for his empiricist sympathies, in his sceptical appraisal of such numerol ogy sarcastically observed that Eddington's interpretative liberal ism would even allow mathematization of St. John's Apocalypse.6 4 G.

ZYCINSKI Its mathematical version would inform that the beast coming out of the sea, which had/(2) horns, was given power for x months, where x equals 1 -/(3) - 3 -/(l). Despite critical comments about Eddington's speculations, Born admitted that two constants play a simultaneously puzzling and fundamental role in the structure of the microworld: the so called fine structure constant a = V137 and the ratio of electron to proton mass ? = Vi836. Bora's article on the "mysterious number 137" develops certain theses accepted by Eddington and by the neo-Pythagoreans.7 Thus, criticism of some forms of numerologi cal speculations still does not imply complete rejection of all nu merical coincidences. A serious drawback of works stressing the importance of these coincidences was that they did not generate observationally confirmed, novel theories. Lacking this element, numerology has remained an expression of private aesthetics in physics. One could admire numerical coincidences between param eters having no direct physical links, but this led neither to the prediction of new phenomena nor to a better understanding of al ready known phenomena. The situation changed radically when the development of rela tivists cosmology made it possible to consider parameters relating to the evolution of the universe. The simultaneous co-appearance of independent properties, which are a necessary condition for the existence of known forms of life, was all the more intriguing, the less probable the appearance of the now observed properties was. For example, the high isotropy of the universe plays an important role for conditions essential for the development of life. When attempts were made toward the end of the sixties to explain its appearance, it was hypothesized that the evolution of the universe starting from arbitrary initial conditions with the passage of time inexorably leads to the presently observable high isotropy. Theo retical studies undertaken by C. B. Collins and S. W. Hawking have confirmed the opposite conclusion: In the set of initial conditions examined, the subset of conditions leading to the observed isotropy of the universe is a zero measure set. Hence cosmic evolution in which anisotropic structures appear with the passage of time would be quite natural. If the incredibly improbable isotropization had 7 Max Born, Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Science A 2 (1935): 533.</page><page sequence="5">THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE 321 not taken place in this evolution, conditions would not exist in the universe for the appearance of carbon-based forms of life, and cos mology as a science would not exist. Without avoiding paradoxical statements, Collins and Hawking close their analyses with the con clusion: "in a sense, the isotropy of the Universe is a consequence of our existence."8 This apparently paradoxical conclusion may be expressed in less controversial formula: "If life could not arise without isotropy, then from the existence of the human ob server one can conclude that the universe is isotropic." However, contrary to Collins's and Hawking's intentions, their statement taken literally created the opportunity to introduce stronger var iants of the Anthropic Principle. Putting the relations between the human observer and the properties of the universe in causal categories, these variants treat the observed properties of the uni verse as a consequence of the existence of the observer. As a rule, strong ontological and epistemological assumptions are also intro duced in these interpretations. The basic variant of the so-called Weak Anthropic Principle is free of these assumptions. It confines itself to the dependencies discovered in the natural sciences and states: the observed values of physical and cosmological parameters, regardless of the probability of their appearance, take on values in an interval that makes possi ble the emergence of life based on carbon compounds. The philosophically intriguing nature of the Weak Anthropic Principle recalls Leibniz's theory of Pre-established Harmony. A great coincidence of parameters that made possible the emergence of life appeared in our environment in a universe that has been evolving for billions of years. If twenty billion years ago the rate of expansion were minimally smaller, the universe would have en tered a stage of contraction at a time when temperatures of thou sands of degrees were prevalent and life could not have appeared. If the distribution of matter in space were more uniform the galax ies could not have formed. If it were less uniform, instead of the presently observed stars, black holes would have formed from the collapsing matter. Many examples of similar coincidences can be cited.9 Even if future research modifies some of the present conclusions, the 8 C. B. Collins, S. W. Hawking, Astrophysical Journal 180 (1973): 317. 9 Their detailed presentation is contained in J. D. Barrow and F. J. Tipler, The Anthropic Cosmological Principle (Oxford 1986). This compre hensive monography is mentioned in further notes as 'ACP'.</page><page sequence="6">322 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI meaning of the others seems quite clear: from an infinite set of theoretical possibilities those conditions appeared in the universe which made life possible. Whether these cosmological coincidences should be regarded as an accident or as manifestation of teleology of nature goes beyond the cognitive competency of the natural sciences. In philosophical debates on the question, however, as much attention as possible should be paid to the likely direction of future scientific research as well as interconnections between causal and teleological expla nation. II Discussions on the philosophical significance of the Anthropic Principle are rendered difficult because various authors propose different variants of the principle. The version of the Weak Anthropic Principle cited earlier limits itself to simply stating the coincidence between conditions necessary for the appearance of life and conditions which in fact exist. Since the time of Mach, how ever, we know that science has not been a catalogue of recorded facts. Hence efforts are also being made to introduce stronger variants of the principle, which would make it possible to predict new phenomena or to evaluate alternative cosmological hypothe ses. One of these variants is Carter's Strong Anthropic Principle. It states: the universe must have those properties which make pos sible the development of life in a particular stage of cosmic evo lution.10 Depending on how "must have" is interpreted, this variant can express quite different meanings. In its weakest interpretation the term 'must have' can be regarded as an ex post facto recon struction similar to Collins's and Hawking's procedure. Every thing suggests that this is the meaning which Carter originally gave to the term, believing that since life in fact did appear, in explanation of the earlier stages of cosmic evolution we have to consider those conditions which lead to the appearance of the human observer. 10 Cf. ACP, 21.</page><page sequence="7">THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE 323 In a different interpretation, "must have" connotes necessary causal relations whose occurrence led to the appearance of life. Such an interpretation could lead to a philosophy close to the vision presented in Monod's Chance and Necessity. The problem, how ever, is that the coincidence of parameters revealed by the principle not only does not appear presently as the result of physical neces sity, but even seems to exclude the possibility that future scientific research can discover the mechanisms determining such neces sity. To be sure, contemporary works on the model of the infla tionary universe have led to the discovery of dependencies between some properties which earlier had been regarded as independent.11 Taking account of inflationary processes does not explain, however, the coexistence of properties and laws denoted by the Weak Anthropic Principle. There are no connections between the topo logical structure of the universe, for example, and the values of many physical constants, and neither does it seem possible in any way whatsoever to reduce the laws of nature to the initial condi tions of cosmic evolution.12 The coincidence of the laws in force and the small subset of initial conditions belonging to the infinite set of all possible conditions remains cognitively intriguing and stimulates the search for deeper explanations. In extreme cases the term 'must have' in the cited formulation of the Strong Anthropic Principle is understood ideologically. The appearance of life and the human observer is the goal of cosmic evolution, and hence the selection of conditions and laws must be subordinated to this goal. Even stronger teleological accents ap pear in the Participatory and Final variants of the Anthropic Prin ciple. In some approaches both of these variants are regarded as specific versions of the Strong Anthropic Principle; in others they are regarded as independent versions of the principle. Regardless of classification conventions, the Participatory Anthropic Principle refers to the epistemological assumptions formulated by J. A. Wheeler in his interpretation of quantum mechanics. These as sumptions are close to Berkeley's philosophy, and their basic axiom asserts: in the microworld no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it 11 See ACP, 434-38; the initial version of the cosmological model with inflation was presented by A.

ZYCINSKI has been registered by the observer.13 After extending a similar epistemology to the cosmic level, Wheeler formulated the Partici patory Anthropic Principle, which states: the observer is necessary for the universe to exist.14 After some refinements, this principle can be reconciled with Kant's epistemology. This variant is most often referred to in research practice by supporters of the contro versial Everett's many-world interpretation of quantum me chanics.15 In the variant, the Final Anthropic Principle, the additional strong assumption is introduced that life, which appeared in the process of cosmic evolution, will always exist in the universe. The effect of this is that in discussions on the future evolution of the universe attempts are made to exclude cosmological models in which the existence of life in the future is impossible. Such an approach leads not only to an a priori solution of empirical ques tions, but also to highly doubtful futuristic speculations. Vision ary physical eschatology then attempts to link Teilhardism with the physics of black holes, describing evolution as moving toward a "physically reinterpreted" point of Omega in which life and infor mation take control over the entire universe.16 Despite the extremely speculative nature of the Final An thropic Principle, there are practically unlimited possibilities of constructing even stronger variants of the principle by introducing additional, completely unsubstantiated assumptions. Using the same method of groundless generalizations, one could easily intro duce, for instance, a hylozoic variant of the Anthropic Principle, stating that life existed in hidden form in past stages of cosmic evolution. These variants show that a philosophical discussion on the Anthropic Principle as such would be pointless. On the other hand, what is desirable and even necessary is to ask about the ontic deter minants of the regularities revealed by the Weak Anthropic Princi ple. A matter of great philosophical significance is at stake: do the 13 J. A. Wheeler, "Beyond the Black Hole" in Some Strangeness in the Proportion, ?d. H.

Hintikka (Dordrecht, 1977), 3. 15 The first version of the theory was published by Everett in The Review of Modern Physics 29 (1957): 454. 16 See, for instance, ACP, 677.</page><page sequence="9">THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE 325 regularities shown by this variant of the principle permit a teleo logical interpretation of the universe as a whole? Ill The paradigm of modern science led to the elimination of te leological explanations from the natural sciences and to their re placement by causal ones. This elimination is not complete inas much as teleological categories still appear in some works in biol ogy. Supporters of these categories say that teleology can be compared with an ex-fianc?e, with whom one is ashamed to be seen but with whom one finds it hard to break off. It seems that inter pretative dilemmas can be avoided by allowing the heuristic variant of quasi-teleological interpretations. This variant would be a methodological postulate and not a doctrinal assertion. It would make it possible to approach the phenomena studied as though they were evolving toward a particular goal, and at the same time it would not assume in advance that such a goal really exists.17 This approach could turn out to be heuristically valuable, if the consider ation of quasi-teleological aspects of nature made it possible to develop research programs in which, while respecting the principles of empirical testability, the appearance of regularities impossible to account for by genetic causality would be explained. The methodological approach which I suggest differs from the proposals of authors who attempt to rehabilitate teleological expla nations in science even when they provide no additional informa tion besides that contained in causal explanations. These authors very often refer to the equipollence of differential and integral forms of variational principles, to the work of Wheeler and Feyn man of 1945 in electrodynamics, and even to the highly speculative tachyons hypothesis. These adductions are supposed to confirm the thesis on the necessity for rehabilitating teleological categories in physics. This thesis seems doubtful for many reasons, how ever. Especially controversial is the proposal to take the broadly understood directedness of physical processes as a sufficient condi 17 Such an approach was defended among the Thomists by K. Kt?sak. See his "Zagadnienie teleologicznej interpretacji przyrody we wsp??czes nej neoscholastyce" in Pod tchnieniem Ducha Swietego, ed. M. Finke (Poznan, 1964), 25-60 (in Polish).</page><page sequence="10">326 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI tion for recognizing these processes as goal-directed. Observing the motion of a stone in the gravitational field of the earth, we could study it by considering the conditions of its future collision with the earth's surface. Such a prospect, however, does not entitle us to regard this motion as a goal-directed process, if at the same time we do not support Aristotle's theory of natural place. For modern physics this theory is groundless as well as superfluous, since it supplies no information that would not be contained in the causal description of motion. The authors who attempt to rehabilitate teleological explana tions in biology try to introduce the latter in studies of local phe nomena when they interpret, for instance, the functioning of a cell or organ within the system as a whole. As regards the Anthropic Principle, however, the more complicated problem arises of whether arguments can be found to support the thesis of global design in the universe as whole. The natural sciences seem incapa ble of providing such grounds, since their typical cognitive approach is to search for causal explanations. The period when teleological categories were used in science was one of interpretative stagna tion, in which anthropomorphic metaphors were regarded as ra tional explanations. Even if concrete teleological explanations led to the growth of progressive research programs,18 supplying infor mation unattainable in causal explanations, natural scientists for epistemological reasons will always prefer the latter. This situa tion presently exists. The Strong Anthropic Principle allows one to make predictions which would be groundless on the basis of a purely causal interpretation of nature.19 This fact still does not allow philosophical assertions on the existence of cosmic design. It only allows acceptance of stronger variants of the Anthropic Princi ple as assumptions making possible the development of heuristi cally valuable research programs. When natural scientists can introduce teleological variants of the principle as hypotheses to be empirically tested, philosophers have no independent evidence which would confirm the existence of the goal-directed structure of the universe as a whole. To intro 18 In understanding the concept of progressive research programs I follow Imre Lakatos's theory of scientific research programs. 19 See, for instance, predictions formulated by Barrow and Tipler on the basis of the Strong Anthropic Principle in ACP, 503-04.</page><page sequence="11">THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE 327 duce such a conjecture would be risky, since the development of scientific research can lead to the falsification of teleological var iants of the Strong Anthropic Principle as well as to discovery of the causal mechanisms of some processes now regarded as teleo logical. Such discoveries would confirm the opinion that the in troduction of teleological interpretations again turns out to be nothing but a result of naive anthropomorphizing. The basic problem that appears in this context is the question: What physical determinants could explain the extremely improba ble coincidence of parameters indicated by the Weak Anthropic Principle? Currently popular attempts to question the teleological interpretation of this principle are connected with the hypothesis of the world ensemble. According to the hypothesis, the global evo lution of the universe is subject to sophisticated laws and takes place in a way different from the one observed by us in our cosmic neighborhood of a dozen or so billion light years. IV Recognizing the coincidences described by the Anthropic Prin ciple as a simple accident would be too naive an explanation. For the puzzling coincidences emerge on a cosmological level, in the mysterious co-appearance of improbable initial conditions and the laws of cosmic evolution. The coincidences do not concern a single event which could always happen when its probability is greater than zero; they concern a long sequence of processes making possi ble the development of living organisms.20 In such a situation the easiest interpretative dodge would be to accept the hypothesis that in the universe?understood as maximum set of existing physical objects?there exists an infinite number of systems similar to "our world," whose approximate description is provided by the so-called standard cosmological model. Following acceptance of this strong 20 Many authors expect that certain regularities denoted by the Weak Anthropic Principle can be explained on the basis of Prigogine's thermo dynamics of irreversible processes. Although their conjectures should be treated seriously, at the present time they seem to explain ignotum per ignotum. Cf. H. R. Pagels's opinion on unrestricted use of Prigogine's result ("Is the irreversibility we see a fundamental property of nature?" Physics Today 22 [1985]: 97).</page><page sequence="12">328 THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE assumption, one can regard the coincidences described by the Weak Anthropic Principle as cognitively trivial. They occur in our world, which is one of only a few systems in which life could develop. Different physical constants and other laws of nature appear in other systems of a similar type. Life did not develop there, and hence there is no problem in them of mechanisms determining anthropic coincidences. In such an approach the meaning of the Weak Anthropic Prin ciple is neutralized by an appeal to the principles of the calculus of probability. In the infinite world ensemble all possible combina tions of laws, physical constants, and initial conditions must be realized. Our "universe" also had to come into being. The fact that we found ourselves in a privileged system is nothing mysteri ous. In other systems the physical conditions were simply not appropriate for the appearance of the human observer. Hence the cosmological harmony we observe can be explained by assuming that our position in the universe is untypical, since we find our selves in one of the exceptional subsets of the infinite ensemble of worlds. This hypothesis denies the so-called Copernican principle that assumes that we do not occupy a privileged position in the uni verse. Sympathizers of the world ensemble hypothesis express hostility to this principle already on the terminological level, call ing it the principle of mediocrity or a dogma of modern science.21 The latter expression is nearer the truth, because since the time of the Newtonian revolution the Copernican principle has been the basic assumption of modern science. One could debate whether in the paradigm of modern science a greater role is played by the presence of the Copernican principle or the absence of teleological categories. Another essential flaw of the world ensemble hypothesis is its obvious conflict with the principle of Ockham's razor. An inter pretative procedure in which worlds are multiplied without need and without substantive grounds gives rise to understandable op position.22 For this reason a special "de-Ockhamization" pro 21 ACP, xi, 577. 22 Cf. John Polkinghorne's opinion on such an approach: "It is enough to make poor William of Occam turn in his grave. Entities are being</page><page sequence="13">THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE 329 gram23 has been linked with it. Its supporters indicate many ex amples of the disadvantageous consequences of the application of this principle in science. It is true that in the nineteenth century the appeal to Ockham's razor retarded the development of extraga lactic astronomy by nearly one hundred years. In that situation, however, empirical data were available to challenge the validity of economic interpretations based on Ockham's principle. As regards the world-ensemble hypothesis, the situation is quite different. Not only is there no empirical confirmation, but in fact there can be none, since the neighboring worlds are supposed to be causally disjoint,24 and thus inaccessible to direct observation. In theoretical arguments one tries to link the speculative world ensemble hypothesis with various physical theories. Some of the supporters of the hypothesis refer to a conception defended by Wheeler in the past, namely, an infinite sequence of systems which evolve cyclically leading to a change in physical conditions and laws.25 Other versions refer to Markov's version of semiclosed worlds26 or to the idea of the bubble universe that was introduced in 1966 in order to save the steady state theory and is developed today by R. Gott.27 The most popular of these proposals is H. Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics that allows for the existence of parallel worlds. Some physicists have hopes that this interpre tation will lead to a new scientific paradigm, but the vast majority regard it as a product of creative imagination, with its greatest value being its mathematical formalism. Realistic interpretations of Everett's hypothesis contain strong conclusions on the existence of systems parallel to our uni verse. Supposedly existing in some of these systems are copies of multiplied with incredible profusion. Such prodigality makes little appeal to professional scientists, whose instincts are to seek for a tight and eco nomical understanding of the world." (The Quantum World, [Longman, 1984], 68). 23 J.

ZYCINSKI terrestrial observers realizing statistical variants of our biogra phies in different physical conditions. In order to avoid difficulties with the Anthropic Principle, such approaches introduce strong anthropological and ontological theses that are closer to science fiction than to science.28 Their astonishing popularity depends on, among other things, the unclear content of statements about the real existence of so-called possible worlds. Presenting his version of the world ensemble hypothesis in 1973, G. Steigman referred to the notion of possible worlds.29 This concept is the central subject of contemporary analyses in the on tology of modality. The real existence of possible worlds is recog nized by many authors who differentiate between actuality and existence. In their approach, some states of affairs are unactual, nevertheless they exist. When expounding this philosophy of actu alism Alvin Plantinga claims: "Quine's being a politician ... is a state of affairs that is not actual. ... Of course it isn't my claim that this state of affairs does not exist... ; indeed there is such a state of affairs and it exists. . . . But it does not obtain: it isn't actual."30 Plantinga's assertion that all the possible worlds exist in the actual world was inappropriately understood by those au thors who confused actuality with existence. Owing to this ele mentary confusion they ascribed the actual existence to all ele ments of the world ensemble. Such an interpretative procedure cannot be justified for many reasons. If, in reinterpretation of the world ensemble hypothesis, and in Everett's many-worlds theory, the principles of modal actualism were strictly observed, the many-worlds hypotheses would no longer be useful in explaining determinants of the regularities shown by the Weak Anthropic Principle. For then the same question would remain: Why from an infinite set of possible worlds was the one realized in which life could develop? 28 See G. Gale, "The Anthropic Principle," Scientific American 245 (1981): 114-122. 29 G.

Regardless of differences of opinion in evaluations of this principle, one can make some general conclusions of cognitive interest for philosophy: 1. The Weak Anthropic Principle is not the product of arbi trary numerological speculations, but a generalization of scientific discoveries disclosing important regularities in cosmic evolution. The coincidences of parameters shown by this principle are so in triguing that some scientists in their commentaries to them intro duce elements of the philosophy of pantheism, writing about the rational creative force that directs the evolution of the universe.31 2. The name 'Anthropic Principle' was chosen not too fortu nately by Carter. The alternative expression 'Psychocentric Prin ciple' has been suggested by J. Leslie.32 I personally regard the expression 'Biotic Principle' as more apt. However, terminological subtleties are less important than the fact that various meanings are attached to the same principle. Some of variants suggested are completely groundless. The status of the Weak Anthropic Princi ple is unaffected by their criticism. 3. For methodological reasons teleological variants of the Strong Anthropic Principle can be introduced in the natural sciences only as heuristic postulates. The value of such postulates can be evaluated by studying their role in the theoretical develop ment of new research programs and the empirical status of new predictions formulated in these programs. 4. There apparently is no possibility of working out a philo sophical argument in which the Anthropic Principle alone would provide grounds for re-establishing teleological interpretation of 31 This philosophy is contained in Leslie's comments on the Anthropic Principle when he writes: "calling [the argument] evidence of Design (rather than of a World Ensemble) does not always indicate a Designer. God might be not a Person but a creative force: our world of life may through its own nature have a requiredness which is creatively effective." American Philosophical Quarterly 19 (1982): 141. 32 Ibid. 144.</page><page sequence="16">332 JOSEPH M. ZYCINSKI nature. The attempts to introduce a similar conclusion carry the risk of repeating the anthropomorphisms which encumbered var ious forms of teleological arguments in the past. Suggestions to make a distinction between the strong (intentional) and weak (ob jective) version of the principle of teleology33 and to apply the latter version in the philosophical description of the Anthropic Principle only increase the terminological chaos in the field of teleological interpretations. 5. Though there are no substantive grounds for a teleological interpretation of the coincidences shown by the Weak Anthropic Principle, the appearance of these coincidences supports the con clusion on the anti-accidental nature of cosmic evolution. In this perspective we find not only stable numerical correlations, that were investigated in the past by the neo-Pythagoreans, but also dynamic interdependencies displayed in twenty billion years of cosmic evolution. 6. The Anthropic Principle focuses our attention on those aspects of nature which were neglected in the positivist philosophy of science. During the period of discussion on protocol sentences or the elimination of theoretical terms, philosophers lost sight of such essential facts as the mathematical regularity of nature or the stability of relations expressed by laws of nature. Now when the period of fascination with empiricism has ended in science, reflec tion on the puzzling manifestations of the harmony of nature is necessary, a harmony which is revealed by, among other things, cosmological coincidences. 7. Scientific research is continually being conducted on the physical aspects of the Anthropic Principle. This has resulted in new versions of the inflationary model, modified variants of the world ensemble hypothesis, the notion of the Superweak Anthropic Principle.34 The same question remains, nonetheless, intriguing in 33 J. Ladri?re, "Quelques questions ? propos du th?me: Un Cosmos en ?volution," preprint 1986. 34 In Leslie's formulation the Superweak Principle sounds tautologi cal: "If life's emergence, no matter how hospitable the environment, always involves very improbable happenings, then we living beings emerged where such happenings happened" ("The Scientific Weight of Anthropic and Teleological Principles" in Current Issues in Teleology, ed.

Positivistic critics of metaphysics regarded as meaningless the question: Why does something rather than nothing exist? The Anthropic Principle supplies a new version of this question: Why does life exist in the universe and not the chaos of uncoordinated parameters? To include this question among pseudoproblems would be a hallmark of a convenient metaphysics that ignores the basic problems of modern science relating to the Anthropic Principle.
