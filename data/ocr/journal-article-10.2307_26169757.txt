<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature Nicholas Mowad 73625 Fred Waring Drive, #2, Palm Desert, CA  92260; nmowad@hotmail.com Hegel provides a previously unnoticed foundation for an environmental ethic according  to which the environment is not a collection of mere objects to be exploited arbitrarily.  Indeed, the environment is not even merely natural, but also an expression of culture. In  identifying this relation between nature and culture, Hegel anticipates “bioregionalism,”  though he would also be critical of this school of thought. I conclude that Hegel offers  the foundations for an environmental ethic (though not a fully articulated theory) by  showing how the natural environment is part of who we are, and so ought not to be  treated arbitrarily. It may be surprising to some to think of Hegel’s work as offering or even  implying a theory of environmental ethics.1 If Hegel is known at all in  the popular consciousness, he is thought of as an arch-intellectualist,  one who degrades nature and exalts spirit, that is, thought or human  culture, establishing a stark division between what is human and what  is merely natural. From this representation, one would think that Hegel  has nothing but contempt for nature.2 The falsity of this representation  has already been demonstrated in the work others have done to  1.   Both Hegel’s Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts (Elements of the Philosophy of  Right) and Enzyklopädie der Philosophischen Wissenschaften (Encyclopedia of the Philosophical  Sciences) are divided into numbered paragraphs, obviating the need for distinct  German and English citations. Hegel’s Encyclopedia is usually published in three  volumes, but the numbered paragraphs run continuously through all three.  Accordingly, I will simply cite “Encyclopedia” and the paragraph number for  material in any volume. Moreover, all such citations will refer to the third edition  of 1830. Some paragraphs have Anmerkungen (remarks) added in later editions,  and some also have Zusätze (additions) added after Hegel’s death from lecture  notes. I will make clear if I am drawing on these. I will also cite from editions of  Hegel’s lectures (e.g., on world history, religion, or philosophy of spirit) that are  not divided into numbered paragraphs. For these, I will give both the German  and (where available) the English. All translations from German are my own. 2.

I will demonstrate that geography plays  such an important role in Hegel’s view of cultural self-consciousness  that a people cannot treat its environment as a mere collection of  intrinsically valueless objects that can at best be exploited for purposes  alien to them. In the course of this demonstration we will see that Hegel  anticipates some positions of what is today called “bioregionalism,”  though he differs from advocates of bioregionalism in important  respects as well. I neither affirm nor deny that for Hegel the natural qua natural  has intrinsic value, as it does for some more recent thinkers.4 I claim  only that for Hegel there are certain things that at once are natural and  possess intrinsic value insofar as they are necessarily involved in human  cultural self-understanding (spirit). Such things, which Hegel calls  “anthropological,” include the human body and geography, the natural  environment of a people. While Hegel does not say explicitly that we  are obligated not to treat the environment in certain ways (perhaps  because industrialization had not yet reached a point where the question  of obligations toward the environment could be posed), his implicit  commitment to this position can be seen by an investigation into what  it means to be “anthropological,” understanding how precisely the  environment is “anthropological,” and considering what he says about  other anthropological phenomena, like the human body.  We will arrive at Hegel’s account of the role of geography in human  social life by way of an examination of his accounts of property and  of the human body. These preliminary investigations will present in  a simpler way how Hegel understands the relation between what is  human (spirit) and nature so that Hegel’s environmental ethic can  subsequently be more easily articulated in our exploration of geography  and human communities. It is useful to examine Hegel’s account of property because there  he gives an account of the human relationship to the world that would  seem to be dualistic: it seems to present the human will and the natural  3.

That is, it  seems that Hegel is presenting a dualism in which humanity and culture  are presented as the opposite of nature: Hegel appears to identify culture  as the ideal, what is most true and good, while defining nature by its  lack of what culture has, and hence as necessarily deficient, inadequate,  and unimportant. Many have identified these kinds of dualisms as a  major source of misunderstandings regarding the human relation to  the world of nature, and consequently the foremost stumbling block  for an environmental ethic.5 However, my analysis of property, and  subsequently the human body and the natural world generally, will  show that Hegel is doing precisely the opposite. Accordingly, in what follows I will (I) examine Hegel’s  understanding of property in order to begin to articulate the relation  as Hegel understands it between nature and culture. The aim in this  section will be to show that the two are not separate and unrelated, nor  only arbitrarily related, but rather that culture (or spirit) must express  and realize itself in nature. Next (II) I will show that there is at least one  natural body (namely, the human body) which is “anthropological,”  at once natural and distinctively human (that is, cultural, an object of  spirit). Subsequently (III), I will further explain what “anthropological”  means for Hegel, and show that for Hegel not only is the human body  such an “anthropological” phenomenon, at once corporeal and having  intrinsic worth, but for Hegel the natural environment generally enjoys  this status insofar as it has a constitutive role in human culture, identity,  and self-understanding. I will then (IV) be able to give some examples  of how the natural environment is bound to human culture. Given the  relation between regional geographical character and the character of a  particular culture, I will note (V) that Hegel anticipated in some respects  what is today called “bioregionalism.” I will conclude (VI) by arguing  that Hegel also differs in some important respects from contemporary  bioregionalism, though he does still offer the foundations for the  development a genuine environmental ethic that is perhaps a distant  ancestor of contemporary bioregionalism.  I. Hegel’s Account of Property Hegel understands the existence of property not as something merely  conventional or arbitrarily established. Rather, for Hegel, it follows  from the very concept of a free human life that there be persons who  own property; and for this reason, human ownership, use, and disposal  5.   See for example Plumwood 1993, 41–68, as well as King 1989. </page> <page sequence="4"> 50 Nicholas Mowad of things (including parts of nature) is justified. Because Hegel’s  understanding of property (and his philosophy generally) is determined  by his conception of freedom, it is appropriate for us to explain this  conception. As Hegel understands it, freedom involves the following  elements:  (1) a will that is able to maintain its independence from each of its  possible objects, even its own inner impulses, that is, a will that can  refuse any particular content (2005, §5). For example, the free person  has the ability to refuse any particular course of action.  (2) the world of various possible contents (2005, §6) (from each of  which the free will can remain aloof).  Though the will is independent of any particular content, the world of  possible contents is still one of the elements (and hence a conditio sine  qua non) of freedom because the will must still adopt some content: to  be an actual free will, the will must choose some course of action, even  if this is only to abstain from acting and to allow what will happen  to happen. Neither of these two “elements” can by itself be identified  as freedom. Instead, freedom is adequately defined only as the unity  of the two “elements” above: the will and its content, or the will’s self- determination in a certain content (2005, §7). In the free person’s  choice of a particular course of action, she gives her freedom (hitherto  only something potential) actual existence, as something real in the world.  Thus freedom does not involve (#1) alone, free will in abstraction  from the world. If freedom were only this abstract will, the world would  indeed be devalued in Hegel’s account: the properly human life would  then be simply a withdrawal from the world, which would be only a limit  to human possibility, and not a positive contribution to it. However, for  Hegel, freedom is not something essentially alien to the natural world.  Rather, freedom is something that must be made real and existent in the  world insofar as the abstract free will is only one element of the free  human life (the world of possible objects for the will is also necessary).  Thus, far from establishing a nature-culture dualism, Hegel demands  that the division between the withdrawn, abstract will and the world of  objects be overcome and that the two be united; that is, Hegel demands  that the will should enter into the world as something particular and  determinate, and that the world should become the embodiment of the  will.  To realize her will in a thing, a person can but need not physically  take possession of it: it suffices simply to impose her will on it somehow,  making the thing serve her ends rather than any natural tendencies it  may have (2005, §44). For example, a person may divert the flow of a  river such that it irrigates her crops. The diverted water is in this case  no longer merely something natural. Rather, it is property: it has been  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature 51 invested with a person’s free will, and thus is the real, tangible existence  of that person’s free will in the world, acting to realize the ends of its  proprietor. One might object that Hegel has denied a nature-culture dualism  only for the sake of asserting the right of culture to invade and “colonize”  nature: there is no dualism (one might argue) only because nature has  been disfigured in order to express culture (nature’s dominator) rather  than itself. Indeed, Hegel’s presentation can give this impression,  insofar as he distinguishes in his account between the “person” (who  is free and has rights) (2005, §35 and remark, §41) and the “thing”  which is not free, has no rights, and apparently exists only as a vessel  for the free will’s realization of itself (2005, §42 and §52). As free, human  beings have the right to seize nature, altering or even destroying it to  suit their own human ends.  However, this impression is inaccurate. Hegel’s analysis of property  appears as the first articulation of “right,” or justice, which is also the  most inadequate and abstract articulation of justice. Hegel’s method is to  proceed dialectically in his examination of a concept, deducing ever  more concrete and adequate articulations of it. It is only at the end of  his investigation into a topic that the reader is given the context in  which the whole investigation must be understood.6 The Philosophy of  Right ends with a discussion of human culture (Sittlichkeit) that qualifies  the articulation of the person-thing relation in the abstract right  section insofar as Hegel understands human culture to be inseparably  connected to its natural environment, in much the same way that the  human body itself, while corporeal, is not a mere thing, but instead  has legitimate rights. It will help to examine how nature and spirit (or  culture) are united in the human body before seeing how they are united  in a particular culture and its environment. But first, let us recapitulate  what we have seen.    It appears that Hegel’s account of property presents a dualism  between the free person and unfree, valueless nature. I will argue that,  in truth, Hegel aims to undermine this dualism. To show this I have  already appealed to Hegel’s presentation of the concept of freedom in The  Philosophy of Right §§5–7, what I called above the “elements” of freedom:  these include both the indeterminate will and the determinate possible  objects of the will (which include the whole natural world). Freedom is  6.   To take one part of any of Hegel’s texts in isolation is to utterly disfigure  and misunderstand his meaning (as is routinely done for example with the  “master-slave dialectic” in the Phenomenology of Spirit). Such a mistake would be  analogous to taking a part of one of Plato’s dialogues in isolation: e.g., plucking  Polemarchus’s (inadequate) definition of justice (Republic 332a) from its context  and presenting it as an articulation of Plato’s position.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 52 Nicholas Mowad the unity of these two: the will’s determination of itself in a particular  content, that is, its realization of freedom in the world. Without both  of these elements there can be no freedom. Were there only to be the  indeterminate “free” will, or were this will to remain indeterminate,  never determining itself by realizing itself in a part of nature, there  would be no actually existing freedom, but rather only possible or implicit  freedom. Since both of these elements are necessary, I argued, it is clear  that Hegel does not establish a dualism with all importance identified  with humanity, leaving nature bereft of value. However (continuing with our recapitulation), I raised the  following objection on behalf of Hegel’s detractors: “the necessity of  natural objects does little to credit Hegel as an environmentalist if  nature need be present only so that it may be a vehicle for an alien will  imposed on it.” Admittedly, as we have presented him so far, Hegel  seems only to tolerate nature as an instrument for human ends. Yet for  Hegel there is a certain natural object with which we are all familiar that  is not a mere “thing” for the will, and which the will hence does not have  the absolute right to dispose of arbitrarily: this special natural object is  the person’s own body. II. The Human Body As Both Nature and Spirit It is in the person’s body that the apparent dualism between the person  and the world of nature breaks down, as Hegel is keen to show. For, in  one’s own body one has an object that is equally a subject: the body is  something felt, but also something that feels (2005, §48, remark). Thus  while it belongs to the essence of the free will that it be able to dissociate  itself from any natural thing in which it had previously invested itself  (2005, §§64–65),7 the free will may not alienate its own body. To be sure,  the free will may treat its body as an instrument—indeed, the free will  can hardly avoid doing so if it is to remain alive. But the free will may  not divest itself wholly of its body and life: it may not sell itself into  slavery, for example, nor may it kill or mutilate its body (2005, §66 and  §70).8 The human body is never merely a “thing,” but rather is always  “the existence of freedom” (2005, §48, remark). Though it can be made  to serve as an instrument for the will, there are limits to how it may be  thus used; the human body is indeed a part of corporeal nature, but it  always commands respect.  Hegel thus shows how the dualism between, on the one hand, a  “free will” that was disconnected from the world and was the sole giver  of ends and, on the other, the natural world that is not an end in itself  but rather only a means for the free will, collapses in the identity of  7.

See also Siep 1990; Nuzzo 2001; and Ciavatta 2005. </page> <page sequence="7"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature 53 freedom and nature in the human body. It is mere sophistry, Hegel says,  to try to separate myself as a free will from my embodiment: accordingly,  my body has rights against being harmed by others (2005, §48, remark).  Others must not therefore treat my body as a mere thing, a possible  vessel for their own projects; rather, others must treat my body as an  end in itself, having intrinsic dignity and worth, and commanding their  respect. The human body is thus something quite peculiar: it is corporeal,  yet it has inherent value. Before giving reasons in the Philosophy of Right for  why the human body cannot be treated as a mere thing, Hegel analyzed  the human body in his “anthropology” (located in his “philosophy of  subjective spirit”). An examination of what Hegel has to say there can  shed further light on Hegel’s understanding of the ambiguous status of  certain parts of nature (such as we have seen the human body to be).  III. Anthropology and Geography In his “anthropology” Hegel is concerned with the status of what is  at once natural and distinctively human (i.e., cultural or “spiritual”).  Accordingly, he addresses many aspects of human embodiment: gender  differentiation, ageing, sleeping, dreaming, and waking, sensibility, and  feeling (Encyclopedia, §§396–410). In all of these cases Hegel is interested  in how certain aspects of human life are not simply natural, and yet are  irreducibly corporeal. His aim is to show both that a purely biological  account of these phenomena would fail to express certain distinctively  human aspects inherent in them, and also that in these phenomena the  human or cultural meaning is embedded in a natural form.  We have seen in our discussion of property and human corporeity that  the human body has this status as an “anthropological” phenomenon.  Yet, many might still object that Hegel cannot be considered a genuine  environmentalist: after all, his ostensible “environmentalism” would  be exceedingly anthropomorphic, valuing only the bodies and other  attributes of human beings. However, the individual human being is not  the only object under consideration in the “anthropology.” The natural  environment of a people is also considered there as a distinctively  “anthropological” phenomenon. An examination of these passages  in the anthropology section coupled with Hegel’s lectures on world  history and religion will allow us to see the role geography plays in  the self-consciousness and character of a people, a role that justifies its  “anthropological” status. It will then be clear that Hegel can be read as  raising the environment generally to the privileged status we see the human  body as having in his discussion of property. That these are “anthropological” means that what is natural in  them (i.e., what is corporeal, parts outside of parts [Encyclopedia, §247])  is inseparable from a distinctively human, cultural (i.e., spiritual)  </page> <page sequence="8"> 54 Nicholas Mowad meaning. It is not that there is a correspondence between what is in nature  and human thought and culture, because a correspondence implies  that the two corresponding sides are separate or could exist and be as  they are separately. On the contrary, here corporeal nature cannot be  properly understood apart from its cultural meaning, just as a culture  cannot be understood apart from the natural world, or a certain part  of it. Hegel expresses this interdependent relation by describing spirit  as “the truth of nature” (Encyclopedia, §381 and §388). Hegel defines  truth as the agreement between concept and objectivity, or what a thing  should be (what it is according to its concept) and what it is in fact  (Encyclopedia, §213, remark; §23, addition #2). Thus, spirit is in fact what  nature strives to be, what nature is according to its concept but not in  reality. Hegel makes the same point in calling nature the “presupposition  [Voraussetzung]” of spirit (Encyclopedia, §381). The term “presupposition”  is a technical term for Hegel. What is “presupposed [vorausgesetzt]” is  meant to be understood in its distinction from what is merely “posed,” or  “posited [gesetzt],” as is clear in his explanation of “actuality [Wirklichkeit].”  Hegel explains actuality (the unity of essence and existence, i.e., the  existence of what is essential) by giving its three “moments” or aspects:  (1) the condition(s); (2) the “matter,” or thing itself (Sache); and (3) the  activity (Encyclopedia, §148). The condition is that in the actual which  merely exists contingently. The “matter” should not be understood as  physical materiality, but rather as the actual insofar as it is something  only possible, that is, the essential thing that is to be brought about.  In other words, it is the important thing, the “matter at hand.” The  activity is the transformation of the merely possible and essential  (“matter”) into something actually existing, or, what is the same thing,  the transformation of mere contingent existence into what is essential.  Taken on its own, the condition is merely posited (gesetzt), that is,  it is only something immediately existing, having no apparent relation  to anything else and no meaning. The “matter” too, on its own, is  merely something “posited.” However, when the condition is grasped  as a moment of actuality (i.e., grasped together with the “matter” to  be realized and the activity whereby it is realized), then the condition  is seen as something presupposed (vorausgesetzt), something that does  not possess its truth within itself, but rather is only a moment in the  development of something else.9  9.   Thus Hegel says that there is properly speaking no history of the natural  world (Encyclopedia §339, addition #2): natural proccesses succeed each other,  but the later processes do not take up, comprehend, and preserve the earlier  ones as happens in the human world when one historical epoch succeeds  another. I will indicate below, in part VI, how exactly Hegel thinks this  </page> <page sequence="9"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature 55 That nature generally is the “presupposition” of spirit, of which  spirit is the truth, means that though nature can appear as something  merely immediately existing (something merely posited), it is in fact a  necessary part (or “presupposition”) of, and must be understood in  relation to, spirit (human culture). But we must also note that if we  take human culture in abstraction from its natural side (that is, the  natural world), then culture too would be only something posited, a  mere possibility (which for Hegel would disqualify it as genuine spirit).  Spirit and nature mutually imply each other: each is what it is only by  mediation with the other. Spirit is “the truth” of nature and is “prior”  (Encyclopedia, §381) only because, while the parts of nature remain  separated from each other (as what is corporeal is always parts outside  of parts [Encyclopedia, §247]), the human cultures identified with these  geographical regions can enter into more sophisticated relations with  each other, achieving a kind of unity and reconciliation over the course  of world (political) history that is impossible for nature as such.10 It being granted that spirit and nature bear this intimate, dialectical  relation to each other (a relation that makes “anthopological” phenomena  possible), it remains to be seen how exactly the natural environment  qualifies as something anthropological. Yet there is no single place in  Hegel’s writings that presents fully and adequately the important role  geography plays in his philosophy. To discern what geography means  for Hegel one must assemble various remarks scattered throughout  his Encyclopedia and lectures. When these diverse sections are collected  and organized, it becomes clear that Hegel’s account implies and is  committed to the position (though he does not explicitly articulate it)  that just as the individual human being is a knowing, willing subject  living within a body that is in some sense merely natural, so a nation is  a knowing, willing subject living within a certain natural environment.  And just as the individual human being must not be indifferent  regarding her body, and has no right to dispose of it arbitrarily as if  intercultural understanding is possible, and how this lies in contrast to the  enduring separation of distinct geographical regions. 10.  In §393 Hegel discusses “racial distinction” as a principle differentiating  humanity in accordance with geographical variation, while in §394 this same  principle is extended to the further differentiation of nations (Volker). The racist  remarks attributed to Hegel in surviving transcriptions of his lectures on this  topic have been the subject of much debate recently. It is beyond the scope  of this article to treat Hegel’s understanding of race here. For my treatment  of this issue see Mowad 2013. Let us remark here however that Hegel openly  acknowledged the continuing evolution of his own thought, and hence also the  possibility that he would make mistakes in his treatment of certain phenomena.  It would be foolish to let the mistakes he made in dealing with race lead us to  reject Hegel’s whole philosophy. </page> <page sequence="10"> 56 Nicholas Mowad it were something valueless (and nor are others entitled to treat her  body casually), so a nation must not view its environment in a coldly  utilitarian way, but rather must always maintain a certain reverence for  its home in the natural world (and likewise, other nations must respect  its regional environment).  Hegel discusses geography in the last section of his Philosophy of Nature  (“organics” [Encyclopedia, §§338–342]), but he has very little to say there  that is relevant to our project. Of more interest to us are the parts where  he discusses how the natural divisions of the land that are the object  of geography play a role and are expressed in the social life of human  beings. Accordingly, we may direct our attention first of all toward his  “anthropology” and his lectures on the philosophy of history and the  philosophy of religion. In his “anthropology” Hegel first introduces  the nation as a form of culture exhibiting the unique characteristics of  the part of the natural world where it resides (Encyclopedia, §§393–4).11  In other words, the specific characters of the different regions of the  natural world are expressed in the specific characters of the peoples who  inhabit these regions. Yet Hegel is extremely brief about nationality  and its geographical basis in the anthropology. To get a more detailed  and clear understanding of this relationship we must turn to his lectures  on world history and religion.  Having assimilated all of the sociological, geographical, and  historical material available to a European in his time, Hegel analyzed  various historical (mainly ancient) cultures in order to present the clearest  possible reconstruction of the culture. This reconstruction involved: (1)  identifying what we might call the culture’s central animating principle,  its most fundamental orientation, which exercised a determining  influence on every manifestation of its culture; (2) demonstrating  how this most fundamental principle was itself an expression of the  geographical conditions of the people’s natural environment; and (3)  demonstrating how what we might call all secondary manifestations  of that culture emerge from its single most fundamental principle.  The fundamental organizing and animating principle of a culture (#1  11.   In §393 Hegel discusses “racial distinction” as a principle differentiating  humanity in accordance with geographical variation, while in §394 this same  principle is extended to the further differentiation of nations (Volker). The racist  remarks attributed to Hegel in surviving transcriptions of his lectures on this  topic have been the subject of much debate recently. It is beyond the scope of  this article to treat Hegel’s understanding of race here. Let us remark however  that Hegel openly acknowledged the continuing evolution of his thought,  and hence also the possibility that he would make mistakes in his treatment of  certain phenomena. It would be foolish to let the mistakes he made in dealing  with the idea of race lead us to reject Hegel’s whole philosophy. </page> <page sequence="11"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature 57 above) is what Hegel called its “religion.”12 The “secondary” expressions  of the culture (#3 above) include national customs and manners, the  state’s laws, the people’s diet, their distinctive art, and so on.13  IV. Examples: Rome, Greece, and Egypt In Hegel’s account, the social life of a people has as its organizing  principle a certain understanding of the fundamental reality of  everything, a certain understanding of the rule that guides, determines,  and structures everything in nature and culture: this “understanding” is  the people’s religion. All “secondary” expressions of culture proceed from  (in basic agreement with) the people’s religion: thus the customs and  manners of a people, their state and its laws, their artistic expression,  their language—all of these will be informed by their religion. It need  not be assumed that a people first develops a religion without living in  12.  This applies to all national (ethnische) religions for Hegel, that is, all religions  except Christianity (see Hegel 1985, 412; 1988, 201). Because of this exception,  and because Christianity occupied Hegel more than any other single religion,  religion’s connection to a people’s natural environment can easily escape the  reader’s view: for example, one will find nothing about this relation to the natural  world in the Encyclopedia’s account of “revealed religion” (i.e., Christianity). I  will address what the difference between Christianity and other religions means  for what I am identifying as Hegel’s environmental ethic below, in section VI. 13.  Of course, it is always difficult to establish what the central, defining  principle for a certain culture is, the principle from which everything else in  the culture derives. Historians know that every culture is exceedingly complex,  being expressed often in widely divergent and even contradictory data. Hence  historians may be suspicious of an attempt to distill a culture down to a  single principle, which they may regard as an attempt to introduce a specious  coherence to what are actually widely divergent data. However, the historian  has no cause to object to Hegel, because Hegel does not mean his philosophy  of history to be historiography. He intends rather to reconstruct in thought an  ideal model of a culture, leaving aside extraneous details so that its essence can  be grasped. In much the same way, a physicist explains something like how a  150,000 pound plane can fly through the air by reducing her account to the  main factors (the engine’s thrust, the plane’s shape, the air’s resistance under  normal conditions, the effect of gravity) without denying that in any actual case  of flight there are innumerable other influences and contingencies whose effects  her theory does not account for. The historian may always bring new data to  the table and use it to object to the general picture Hegel gives of a certain  culture. However, the historian may not object to Hegel’s procedure itself: the  purpose of all study (including history) is to present a coherent picture of the  object of study. If the object is a certain historical culture, then every attempt  should be made to integrate the data into a unified theory of the essence of the  culture, a theory that articulates what single principle animates and drives the  culture’s manifold expressions—even if the possibility for future amendment of  this theory is left open.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 58 Nicholas Mowad any state or having any customs or language, and only after establishing  their religion do they set about creating these other expressions of  their culture. Rather, it makes more sense to see Hegel as saying that  when we look back on a historical culture that has already run its course,  we can (as we reconstruct in thought our object of study) identify the  people’s animating principle, the one current throughout all of their  diverse cultural expressions, and we call that principle their “religion.”  Hegel further claims that not only is a people’s religion reflected in all  expressions of their culture, but this religion is itself a reflection of their  natural environment. One of many examples Hegel gives is ancient Rome. The natural  environment of Italy is, Hegel says, the union of different regions  that in themselves do not belong together (2007, 341–2; 1956, 280).  The principle determining Italian geography (viz., the “union that is  brought about among disparate elements”) is likewise the determining  principle for Roman culture on Hegel’s analysis (2007, 339–40; 1956,  278–9).14 Thus the gods of various nations are all brought together in a  single pantheon, as these various nations are brought under one empire.  In contrast, the geographical diversity in Greece (a mainland  divided by numerous mountains and streams, without one feature  predominating) (2007, 277 and 287–88; 1956, 225 and 233–34)  encourages the establishment and survival of numerous distinct  polities, and Greek life is the flourishing of individuality: many different  cities maintain their independence, and empire is difficult to establish.  Likewise, the Greek religion is not dominated by one god: it is a religion  of the “imagination” rather than the abstract “understanding,” and  hence freely creates many gods rather than subsuming them all under  one general divinity (2007, 549–51; 1956, 345–46). Zeus is thus only  primus inter pares: he must bargain with and accommodate various other  gods, each of which has his or her own province and rights.  Hegel thinks that there is this interdependence between a people’s  land and its culture because of the centrality of religion to a culture in  his view. Of course, since “religion” for Hegel means only the central  principle from which all other manifestations of a culture proceed, to  say that “religion” in this sense is central to a culture is tautological.  All religions for Hegel articulate some understanding, even if only a  dim intuition or feeling, of “God,” that is, of the fundamental reality  present in both the human, cultural world and in nature.15 A people’s  14.  Thus Hegel says “The Roman state is based on force both geographically  and historically” (2007, 342; 1956, 280). See also Hegel 1985, 579–582; 1988,  376–388.  15.  Hegel says that not only spirit, but nature also is “a temple of God, which  he fills and in which he is present” (Encyclopedia, §246, addition). </page> <page sequence="13"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature 59 religion has the particular shape that distinguishes it from the religions  of other nations because each religion is the “truth” of the unique,  geographical features of the people’s region. Thus the Greeks saw their  natural environment as diversified into individual regions, each with its  own distinctive character. Accordingly, the Greeks produced a culture  that expresses this natural diversity as its truth, namely, various city- states with unique constitutions, each of which fiercely maintained  its independence. Additionally, Greek religious consciousness had as  its sphere a nearly infinite proliferation of gods, goddesses, nymphs,  dryads, and deified heroes. Because nature and culture are not separate, unrelated realms for  Hegel, a people has a special relationship with its natural environment:  its culture is intimately bound to its natural environment in the way  proper to all “anthropological” phenomena (just as, for Hegel, the  human soul is inseparable from its body). Thus for example Hegel notes  that the geographical features of (ancient) Egypt were present also in  its religion: the annual flooding of the Nile (which fertilizes the plains  and hence makes Egyptian life possible) and its subsequent recession  are to be understood in relation to the Egyptian religion’s account of  the birth of the god Osiris, his death at the hands of Typhon, and the  longing of Isis for Osiris’s return. According to Hegel’s interpretation,  Osiris is spiritually what the Nile (and also the sun, whose increasing  and decreasing power from solstice to solstice corresponds with the  ebb and flow of the Nile) is naturally; Typhon is spiritually what the  harsh desert wind is naturally; and Isis is spiritually what the Earth is  naturally (2007, 256–7; 1956, 208). As the flooding Nile is pushed back  by the desert wind, so Osiris is killed by Typhon; and as the earth then  dries out, making life more difficult, so Isis longs for Osiris’s return.  The elements and relationships that determine the course of Egyptian  geography are likewise those that determine Egyptian culture.  Hegel is not giving a materialist account of culture: he is not saying  that forms of culture are mere epiphenomena derivative of the empirical  experience of material nature. Rather, he is saying that: (1) what makes  a people a people, a social unit distinct from others, is its “religion,”  that is, the shared understanding of its members (however tacit and  unarticulated this understanding may be) of “God,” the fundamental  reality in both nature and culture; (2) a people’s natural environment  takes a certain shape necessarily (by natural causal law); and (3) a culture  freely determines itself, giving itself the same features.16 Thus for Hegel,  16.  A culture’s “self-determination” should be understood in accordance with  the explanation of actuality given above. The natural features of a people’s  environment are, considered on their own, merely immediately existing things  (i.e., they are merely “posited”). However, the culture of the people takes up the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 60 Nicholas Mowad while it can be said that Osiris is a symbol for the sun and the Nile,  it can with equal justification be said that the sun and the Nile are  symbols for Osiris (2007, 258–59; 1956, 209): the Egyptian religion  and way of life are not derivative of the Egyptian natural environment;  rather, Egyptian religion and culture are the truth of the Nile, the sun, the  desert wind, and the Nile valley insofar as it is in the Egyptian religion  that the Egyptian land attains self-knowledge. To recapitulate what we have seen so far: for Hegel there are  certain ambiguously natural-cultural phenomena that belong to his  “anthropology.” What makes a phenomenon “anthropological” is that it  is at once spiritual and corporeal: such anthropological phenomena can  be seen alternately as natural or cultural, but they can only be adequately  understood as both. In addition to the human body, nationality is such  an anthropological phenomenon: the natural side of nationality is  constituted by the geographical conditions of its regional environment;  the spiritual side is the national culture, which is succinctly expressed  in what Hegel identifies as the people’s “religion,” but also seen in what  I have called the “secondary” expressions of the culture (the people’s  manners, language, laws, art, etc.). Given the special relationship a people has with its environment in  Hegel’s analysis, it is clear that it cannot be regarded as a mere collection  of valueless things to be exploited for whatever random purpose a  person wishes to give them. On the contrary, its natural environment  is something literally sacred for a people: it is the material expression  of its religion and culture. Accordingly, Hegel anticipates some of the  arguments and conclusions of what is today called bioregionalism.  V. Bioregionalism Explained Bioregionalism can defined by its opposition to the idea that culture  should relate to nature in the manner of superimposition, such that  culture remains indifferent and intrinsically unrelated to nature.17  parts of their natural world and gives it expression in such a way that the two  are inseparable: the culture is simply the coming to expression of the natural  region. It would be perhaps a bit hyperbolic, and would no doubt invite  misunderstandings, but it would still in a sense be true to say that for Hegel  a region of the natural world thinks in its national culture, just as a national  culture is embodied in its natural region. 17. Hence the term “bioregion,” which indicates that regions should be  demarcated by the natural life in the area, or by other natural, geographical  markers (rather than by arbitrarily established political boundaries). The  markers usually given are watersheds (the land surrounding a network of  bodies of water—and the water itself—which all drain into a common body of  water). See Sale 1985 for an articulation and defense of bioregionalism (43ff).  Alexander has raised doubts about the possibility of establishing bioregions,  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature 61 Instead, bioregionalism advocates a reflection of the peculiar character  of a natural region in the culture of the region—and thus also the  differentiation of cultures according to differentiations in nature. The  unity of nature and culture that bioregionalism calls for is thus not  one to be brought about by the imposition by humans of a uniform  shape on “naturally” different regions, but rather one in which humans  respect the natural character of their region, rooting themselves in the  land physically and socially.  Thus for example a bioregionalist would oppose the attempts of  many in America’s desert Southwest to reproduce what they conceive  as the general American way of life, which includes trying to grow lush  green lawns and keep similarly lush golf courses, though the desert  Southwest is ill-suited to such practices. A bioregionalist in the desert  Southwest would instead learn about and cultivate local forms of life  (appreciating the unique beauty of the different varieties of cactus), and  pursue hobbies that agree with the geography of the region.  This respect for regional diversity would have the benefit of  avoiding the human-made water shortages that plague the Southwest:  these shortages can be seen as symptoms of the alienation of nature and  culture typical of life in a modern industrial country. The bioregionalist  advocates ending this alienation, bringing the way of life of the  people into agreement with the character and needs of the natural  environment. The bioregionalist holds nothing to be intrinsically  wrong with lush, green lawns, but insists only that these do not belong  everywhere. Geographically and climactically speaking, the Southwest  is not the South, or the Northeast, or the Midwest; to that extent,  Southwesterners should not attempt to live like people in those regions,  as if the latter were the ideal. In the same vein, the eighteenth century  proto-Romantic philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder argued that  each nation possesses within itself its own standard for what it should  be (a standard that agrees with its climate and geography); a culture  should therefore strive only to live in agreement with its own regional  way of life, rather than trying to force itself into agreement with the  standard of another culture (1967, 333ff).18  pointing out that the different criteria used for establishing bioregions do not  agree in where boundaries are to be established (1990, 165). But see also Thayer,  who acknowledges that the distinction of nature into bioregions has as much  to do with human perception as with strictly geographical phenomena (2003,  35). Accordingly, Thayer discusses the distinguishing of bioregions not only by  physiography and communities of life, but also by human cultures and forms  of art (15, 33, 60–1, 94). 18. As Berthold-Bond (2000) has noted, bioregionalism has roots in  romanticism (12–16).  </page> <page sequence="16"> 62 Nicholas Mowad VI. Hegel and Bioregionalism Of course, Hegel belongs to a different context and was not in a  position to affirm or deny the doctrines proposed today under the name  “bioregionalism.” Though it is clear from the foregoing examination  of Hegel that he anticipates much of the bioregionalist position (e.g.,  in arguing against separating a natural region from the culture of the  people inhabiting that region), he also departs from it in important  ways. For example, Hegel does not advocate the institution of this unity  or agreement of nature and culture as bioregionalists do, but only argues  that in the nations of antiquity there was such a unity. And, for Hegel,  culture ought to and does develop to the point of freeing itself from  its tie to a certain geographical region: Christianity, which as Hegel  interprets it is the spirit of the medieval and even more so the modern  world, is not rooted in any particular part of the natural world as other  religions and cultures are.19 Christianity is “absolute spirit” precisely  because it does not contain “nature necessity” (Encyclopedia §552), that  is, is not a spirit (or culture) that is the truth of only one particular part  of the natural world. Instead Christianity is the spirit of the entire world,  the truth of all of nature. Hegel’s inspiration for this understanding of Christianity (at least  his notion of it as being not a national religion, but a religion for all  nations, i.e., the truth of the entire world) seems to be the Acts of the  Apostles and St. Paul’s letters to the Romans and Greeks. According  to the Christian tradition, on Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended on  the apostles, who then began speaking in the tongues of all nations  (Acts 2:1–13); St. Peter had a vision to spread Christianity (hitherto  thought of as a sect of Judaism) to people of all nations (Acts 10:9–43);  and St. Paul actively set about spreading Christianity to the Romans,  Greeks, and Phoenicians. Though it is generally held by Christians  that Christianity is the fulfillment of the Jewish scriptures, Hegel holds  that Christianity is the fulfillment of all religions, that all religions and  cultures were incomplete or inadequate expressions of the one human  culture, which finally begins to receive adequate expression in medieval  Christianity, and arrives at its full expression in modernity.  In arguing that Christianity is the “consummate [vollendete]” religion  (i.e., the consummation of all other, particular religions and cultures),  Hegel is arguing against the idea that the world and history present  a mass of unrelated and incompatible religions and cultures. Instead,  19.  See Encyclopedia, §548 and §552. Hegel’s interpretation of Christianity  is highly idiosyncratic, and so the reader should not take Hegel to mean by  “Christianity” anything terribly similar to what is generally meant by the term.  For Hegel Christianity is the basis for a human culture, rather than a national  and hence particular and limited culture. </page> <page sequence="17"> The Natural World of Spirit: Hegel on the Value of Nature 63 Hegel aims to show that all particular national cultures are forms  of the one, human culture, which has been developing within every  culture over the course of world history. In antiquity, each culture was  the truth of only a particular part of the world. Yet Christianity is the  “consummate” culture, the fulfillment and completion of all cultures,  because it is global, that is, it is the truth not of a particular region of  nature, but of the entire world. Accordingly, all religions and cultures  find their fulfillment in Christianity, just as all regions have their place in  a single world. Yet while the coexistence of natural regions in one world  still fails to overcome their spatial separateness, in the consummation of  culture all cultures are able to achieve a reconciliation in affirming the  one human culture. Hegel’s differences from contemporary bioregionalism do not  mean, however, that Hegel lacks a genuine environmental ethic.  Hegel’s enthusiasm for modernity should not be construed as support  for a culture that is alienated from or dominates nature. He esteems  what he calls “Christianity” higher than other religions not because  it is estranged from nature, but because the Christian spirit does not  remain rooted in only a particular part of the natural world, opposed  to other parts, and thus Christianity is not confined to a merely limited  perspective. It is only the insularity and chauvinism that may accompany a  romantic attachment to one’s own region that Hegel opposes. Culture  remains for Hegel something that has an anthropological dimension  despite the fact that in its most developed state this anthropological  dimension has a qualified importance. Analogously, the fact that  ethical action for Hegel involves being able to see beyond one’s own  bodily gratification does not mean that the human body for Hegel is  not still a genuinely “anthropological” phenomenon, at once spiritual  and corporeal (2005, §105).20 Just as one retains a special relationship  (indeed, an identification) with one’s own body despite one’s ability  to place the demands of the body in perspective, so the liberating,  global perspective Hegel associates with modernity need not involve an  alienation from one’s own natural region. Indeed, since modern culture  is the truth of spirit of the world, it must be understood in relation to the  natural world, in abstraction from which it would be something merely  “posited,” and not actual. Because the natural environment thus remains something  “anthropological” for Hegel, it cannot be reduced to a collection of  valueless objects available for exploitation according to the whim of  20.  Contrast also the “ought” of morality (Encyclopedia, §§502–512), which is a  universal good, over and above all individual moral agents, with the “ought”  of practical feeling (Encyclopedia, §§471–472), which is a feeling of pleasure or  displeasure in a single individual.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 64 Nicholas Mowad their possessors. We are now in a position to see how exactly Hegel’s  presentation of the relation between persons and things in abstract right  is misleading. Recall, there he said that “things” have no rights, and can  legitimately be put to whatever use a free person desires. However, Hegel  concludes his Philosophy of Right with an examination of human culture,  giving there the context within which relations between persons and  things must be understood. Human culture or Sittlichkeit is the shared life of a particular people,  which includes family life, civil society (economic relations between  private persons), and the state (citizenship and political identity). It is  usually translated as “ethical life” because this connotes the Greek idea  of the ethos of a people, their particular national character; likewise, Sitten  are the customs of a people, their lived cultural understanding of what  is good and just. Accordingly, Sittlichkeit can be translated as “culture.”  That a culture is the context within which the relation between persons  and their property must be understood should lead us to qualify the  starkness of the relationship as it is articulated at that earlier stage. In  abstraction from the context of a people’s culture, the person and the  thing appear to be polar opposites: the one having rights and the other  having no rights. Yet the whole of Hegel’s social philosophy is aimed at  mitigating this apparent opposition, integrating these abstractions into  their proper context, where it can be seen that the right of persons over  mere “things” is not absolute, insofar as a people’s natural environment  is an “anthropological” phenomenon, the material expression of their  own spirit.  Insofar as one’s particular culture mitigates the authority of the  proprietary person over “things,” contemporary bioregionalism can be  called an heir to Hegel, though it would probably be too much to say that  Hegel offers even a proto-bioregionalism. In fact, Hegel’s philosophy  of history articulates a position very much critical of the idea that the  one human culture is fragmented into various, perhaps irreconcilable  regional cultures taking their distinctive character from immutable  natural differences. However, in uncovering the “anthropological”  sphere of human life and identity, Hegel has provided the foundations  for a genuine environmental ethic, insofar as he has shown the deep  links between human culture and the natural world.
