<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARAPPAN: VEDIC: PROTO-HISTORIC BY T. G. Aravamuthan 1. HARAPPAN CIVILIZATION : THE PROBLEM The civilization, called Harappan, that flourished from about 2800 B. C. to about 1600 B. C. in tha region through which the Indus, as long as it is great, runs its fertile course from the southern foothills of the Himalayas to the waters of the Arabian Sea, forms a very important stage in the progress of a significant section of humanity towards the higher life. That this civilization held sway over a region a thousand miles in length, while the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Lower Mesopotamia had covered no more than a length of six hundred miles each,1 that it flourished for a millennium, that it remained uniform and homogeneous all through that career,2 that it contained in it such notable culture- figures as Siva and Natarāja, and that it gives us clues tò the factors and forces that gave charaoter and distinction to Indian culture in the great days that followed are reasons enough for seeking to understand its origins, course and character and its significance. The vestiges of the civilization have been held to testify to its material culture having attained hi?h standards, - higher in some features, as in sanitary arrangements, than in the contemporary civilisations of West Asia and Egypt. The higher culture of the civilization, however, has been held to have progressed little beyond the levels of Animism and Shamanism and the cults cen- tering in Fertility. The prevailing opinion on the career of the civilization is easy to summarise. In the dim light available from about 6000 B. O , it is believed that from that date to about 1750 B. C. the Indus region knew of no incoming of peoples. About 3000 B. C, the population of India was MeMoMuMa that; is, a composite of 1 Wheeler, IC ( 1953 ), 2. « Piggott, PL ( 1950 ), 138-40 ; cf.

The Mediterranean element was in strength here. Such was Dravidiãn then. Of the culture of the Indus region then, nothing could be said, for little is known. The Ohalcolithic culture that had arisen in the Mediterranean region and West Asia moved toward India about 3000 B. C. and, entered it, perhaps about 2800 B. C. It was an advanced material culture centering in cities and it had a religion dominated by the Great Mother in a milieu of Animism and Shamanism and the Fertility Cult. The Chalco- lithic culture took rapid root in the Indus region and produced a material cultura which, in certain features, such as the rigour of its sanitary rules, improved on Egyptian and West Asian standards, and also a 'spiritual' culture which assumed a specially Indian character.1 In the culture that arose thus the pride of place belonged to two newly born gods, one a Yogi (Pl. 1, top)2 and another a Dancer (Pl. 2,r.). On the probabilities, it is hard to say if these gods represented anything higher than Fertility and Shamanism. The culture started mature and remained immobile. About 1750 B. C. there was an inoursion of the Aryans,3 who overthrew the Harappan forts, which the Aryens called 4puras' and utterly defeated the Harappan peoples, whom they called by the names Dasyu and Dāsa. The virility of Harappan civilization, however, survived and it handed over the Yogi and the Dancer gods, along with minor characters, to the Aryans who, in their scripture, the Rg-Veda% which they developed in this land, gave pride of place to them, endowing them with the names Pasupati-Rudra-Siva and Indra, respectively. It is only to a small extent that the bone-and-blood pattern of the population of the Indus region was altered by the coming of the Aryans, who were Nordics : thair culture was much more of a leavening factor than their blood. None the less, Harappan continued to stand its gr jund sd well that in the culture which could, since 1000 B. C., be called Hinduism the more significant element is Harappan as it had developed before the Aryan arrival. 1 H.

Nor does it take note of considerations that are fund mental. The theory does not tell us whether any Alpinoid element was present in the Harappan population of about 3000 B. 0. and, if it was, what its culture consisted in and what its role was in Harappan. It compels us to infer that abo it 3000 B.C., before the arrival of the Chalcolithic influence, the Dravidian of the Indus region had no culture worth the name. It points to nothing in it that helps us to visualize what each of its components contained. In making Animism, Shamanism and Fertility p,nd the Linga and the Great Mother the characteristics of the Chalcolithic culture it suggests that these had belonged neither to earlier times nor to India in the east and trans- Mediterranean countries in the north-west and the north. It takes no note of the accepted view that the Mother-Goddess cult had, even as early as Upper Palaeolithic times, its cradle-land in the region that covers not only West Asia but also the Russian steppe,1 and so fails to consider the probability of Aryan having come by the traces it contains of that cult in South Russia which was either its original home or a very early habitat. It does not point to any forebears of Paáupati-Rudra-Siva and Indra-Natarāja in either the Chalcolithic of the west of the Indus or the pre-Chalcolithic of Harappa. H ^w the two gods could spring all complete in Harappan with no one to descend from is a mystery. There is also an unwillingness to decide on whether this Siva was an approximation in important features to the Siva of later times and on whether the Yoga in him is not of a brand higher than Shamanism. He and Indra-Natarāja are apparently what make Harappan culture so essentially Indian, but on what gives them that virtue there is the silence of undisclosed, - or of unacquired, - knowledge. These gods have a habitat along the baüks of the Indus but nothing is suggested of where their nativity could have been. 1 E. O.

Yoga, aiming at the extinction of man's desires and passions which are the barriers to his loving his brother man and bis God, has evolved a technique of severe discipline of the senses and the mind leading man to, and establishing him in, Renunciation. Fertility follows on what Yoga aims at eliminating, - Concupiscence, and its sequel, Copu- lation, - and Shamanism is a letting go of the emotions into what frequently is unbridled licence,-" just what Yoga plans to rescue man from. Animism is the exaltation of powers outside of man whereas Yoga is the cultivation by man of power inherent in himself. Yoga is, therefore, opposed to what these other cults stand for * they are incompatible with it. To bring them together is to compound a medley ł not a self-consistent culture. The Pašupati-Rudra-Siva of Harappan is too integrated a personality to be the product of the medley. The horns he brandishes, the uprisen phallus which he exhibits, the bestial company he keeps and the pair of deer which provide the symbolical seat on which to station himself cannot be interpreted in terms of Animism- Shamanism-Fertility : they have all to be understood, not to accord with the ideas of these cults, but to be in harmony with the principles of Yoga. The movement of a Chalcolifchic people into the Indus region to bear the culture along being no part of the theory, it is difficult to see what the impulsion was that brought about the easy accep- tance of the Chalcolithic culture by the Dravidians of Harappa. Only if the MeMoMuMa culture was then insignificant in content and, so, weak in hold could it succumb easily to Animism- Fertility-Shamanism. Even savages resist fiercely the intrusion of a different culture, however superior. How such rural cultures as those of Fertility and »Animism and Shamanism were good enough for the urban culture into which Harappan blossomed overnight and remained rooted in is more than what can pass easy muster. The Aryans who overcame the Harappans, on this theory, gave two distinct names, Dasyu and Dāsa, to their opponents, having,</page><page sequence="5">Harappan : Vedie : Proto-Hisloric 293 evidently, seen two classes or groups in them. Either a distinction to correspond must be found in the Harappan peoples, or opponents other than the MeMoMuMa must be found for the Aryans. Paśupati-Rudra and Indra-Natarāja cannot be denied to pre-Indus Aryan. Indra the Dancer is atleast in Avestan. The climatic conditions chat necessitated the activity of Indra in a milieu to which the Rg-Vttda is late evidence ara enough to account for Rudra, as a nature-god, bearing Indra com- pany in his buffetings against the climate. Rudra has been seen in even Indo-European.1 He is, however, made to enter India where a replica is ready to confront him : the two are made to shake hands and, then, they are merged into each other For this to be Archaecljgy and noe Melodrama the assumption has to be made either that Aryan and Harappan were identical or that Indra- Natarāja and Pasupati-Rudra-Siva were psrsonalities of wholly uncertain antecedents who could present themselves in different cultures at the same time and as native to each. Sufficient has, thus, been said to show that no tinkering with this theory will put it into a condition to get over the objections. It has to be abandoned altogether, even on objections that arise on the assumptions of the 'facts' on which it is rested, notwithstanding that the facts are far from correct. A different vision has to be brought to the perception of the features and the course of the culture if we ar9 to reach a just appraisement of its character and career. The language of the culture falling silent and unintelligible from lips that are mute, the culture denies us a direct statement of some at least of its content. We have to stand satisfied with what we may deduce from the externals of the vestiges ; nothing else explains. The veötiges have lineaments, - forms and looks, - which, though incapable of telling us what the objects inferable in the vestiges meant in the culture, do yet point to the standards on which they were fashioned, the capacities applied to the achiev- ing of the standards, the purposes which the objects were designed for, the moods in which the purposes and methods were conceived and executed, and the temperament which ruled the moods. 1 M. Maohek, in Archiv Orientalni ( 1954 ), 22: 544-62.</page><page sequence="6">294 Annals o/ the Bhandariar Oriental Research Institute Studied for these clues, the externals of the vestiges are reve- latory of even the spirit of the culture, - its characteristics, aims and ways. An estimate arrived at on such data is no more liable to subjective errors than that which has clapped down a Fecundity cult and a Shamanistic god on a culture that attached great value to Yoga and was not only highly urbanized but was almost born urban. The externals of the vestiges do yield valuable deductions. The scripfcorial system of the culture exhibits both an elaboration testi- fying to the language which it records having been supple and subtle, and a simplification pointing to linguistis and scnptogra- phic problems having been subjected to considerable scrutiny. The graphic arts of the culture have that distinction that comes of atten- tion not only to des'gn and execution but also to the rendering of the spirit. Ail any classes of its products bave a monumental quality, even when the objects are fashioned to lilliputtian scales ; even graffiti impose on themselves this quality.1 A grandeur in which graciousness is invariably present is in much of what the culture produced. The desigas on the seals make us wonder, because of their understanding of space and depth and planes and curves, if this culture was not descended from one which had made a marked success of architecture, with its sense of space and deptb0 and of sculpture, with its eye for curves and planes- It is rich in representations of theriomorphs and in symbols, most of them speaking to deep religious feeling ; quite a number of these are even so complex in design that the faith that was reposed in the religion should have been fostered as much in the intricacies of elaboration as in intensity. Detachment and plaoidity suffuse e?en the beasts pictured in the seals. They look as if they would not step one foot forward except at need. Stolid immobility seems to keep the civilization in its grip Yet, life and vigour and spirit there are in the civilization, unmistakably. The muscles of the ani- mals are taut with the imminence of forceful movement. There is no shrinking from a breaking out into movement, which is magnificent in both vigour and range : its bulls could, with sweeps 1 Wheeler, 1C ( 1953 ), 82.</page><page sequence="7">Harappan : Vedic. Prol o- Historic 295 of the horns, send a host of men flying topsy-turvy in the air. The men and the women depicted in the vestiges were dancers to whom graceful movement is of the essence of existence A preparedness for action, a burstirig out into movement if need be, and, withal, a love of the rest of peace, and a keenness for harmony are all spoken to indubitably. The equal love of movement and of rest has worked for a feelicg for poise that has no parallels elsewhere. Stability down the ages, - a conservatism that is remarkable for beinfç ' almost self-imposed',1 - marks every stratum of the culture. A seESe of subdued content with the standards achieved pervades the scene. Only one flaw mars, - the absence of a sense of humour. One wishes that the twinkle which lights up the eye of one or t*o of its charactars* had brightened up many other countenances as well. The civilization had apparently coavinced itself that it had a mission which was seriuus and that a deviation from seriousness would spell a decline from its high purpose. Here we find a culture which had set for itself a serious purpose and had not failed of high achievement in its pursuit. The intel- lectual, the moral and the emotional, - rather, the ' spiritual ' - qualities which so fully dominate the civil. Zition are much higher than what w e see in other ancient cultures. These have not issued from the forces that make for Animism and Shamanism and for the Fertility cult. The presence of much higher ideals and beliefs in the civilization has to be admitted if we are to play fair by it. The theory now current is all too inadequate for an exlpanation of the culture. Indeed, this was realized at an early stage in the study of this civilization. The Paśupati-Rudra-Siva figure was, in full accord with the traditional interpretation of later times, accepted for the Supreme Being of the religion of the culturd in bis role as Preceptor. Had the implications been correctly assessed, the character of the culture would have stood revealed at once and in full.

A number of convictions hold scholars imprisoned and it is these that have determined the view taken of Harappan culture. Firstly, Yoga is Shamanism, while Yãga, Sacrifice, is chanting oneself out of trivial possessions in attempting to cheat the gods with token offerings. There is no realization of Yoga being an auxiliary to Yãga, as a parallel discipline that facilitates the surrendering of possessions to fire. Secondly, Yoga is held to be Dravidian and not Aryan. But, it is only in the sense of Shamanism that Yoga could be Dravidian, the ' parent ' Chalco- lithic knowing of it in only that character. So, where Yoga involves the extinction of desires it can be derived only from Aryan, wherein alone that purpose prevails. Thirdly, Yaga, Sacri- fice, is what the earliest Aryan scripture, the ßg-Veda , embodies and it is silent over Yoga : If Yoga is perchance to be associated with the 'Munť of whom the Rg-Veda makes mention, the reference must be one imputable to the latest days of that antho- logy when Aryan had taken into itself what had been in Dravidian. Granted, but it would be strange to be told that a work on Electricity should deal invariably with the inextricab- ly inter-related subject Magnetism ; stranger still would it be to conclude that, if the only treatise available confines itself to Electricity, the phenomenon of Magnetism should be deemed unknown to nature. Two other convictions add difficulties. One is that while Aryan was the culture of an agricultural-pastoral economy and, so, was primitive, Dravidian had graduated to urban status and, so, had developad a much higher culture. Another is that Aryan developed later than Dravidian, and having come into contact with the latter about 1600 B.C.. became indebted to it for the higher features that mark it in later days. These are quite untenable. Even if it be that Aryan had not known Yoga, its basic cult was Yaga, Sacrifice in Fire, which, as we have seen, has the same aim as Yoga. If Harappan Yoga was only Shamanism, primitive</page><page sequence="9">Harappan : Vedic : Proto-Historic 297 Aryan must be deemed to have gone one batter than advanced Harappan for having developad the discipline of Yaga, and if Harappan Yoga was the praxis of abnegation the two cultures were on the same plane, notwithstanding that Aryan was only agri- cultural-pasGoral and the other was urban. The Aryans might not have come into India before 1750 B. C., but they had practised Sacrifice in "Fire very much earlier. It was apparently in revolt from this discipline, - one dictating the destruction, though in ritual fire, of property, including what was then the costliest of human produ3tions, the soma juice,1- that the Avestans broke away, retaining Agni ( Fire ) as deity to whom worship was to be offered but discarding him as deity into whose merciless maws man bad to keep throwing desirble possessions by way of abnegation, and rejecting soma as even a formal and occa- sional offering. It was evidently on this split that the Yäga- Yoga-minded Aryans bade farewell to the protestants and wended their way to India, passing through what lands and taking how many centuries in that journey we are unable to know. The arrival of the Aryans in the Indus region was, thus, preceded by the long term of the Wandering, and that was preceded by the period of the Schism and that, again, was preceded by the age of Concord. The beginning of this age of Concord could well have been about 2800 B. C,, even if the Rg-Veda , the literature of the period of Colonization after that of the Wandering, is dateable only about 1300 B. C, It may be that its language had suffered such modification on modification from stage to stage as to justify its being held for a late development in Aryan, but there is little to show that the gods, and the ideals, of the age of Concord, had suffer- ed variations in their features or characters : at any rate they had retained enough in them to be taken for Aryan. So, Indra, and Rudra could well be gods of the age of Concord too, and, therefore, as old as 2800 B. C. Indeed, there is evidence elsewhere to show that they are of even the Indo-European stage. Proto-Harap- pan, - which is now found in a North Persian home,8 - could have been met by Aryan in North Persia, and Aryan could there have passed Indra and Rudra to Proto-Harappan. 1 Aravamuthan, in Triveni (1956 Juiy ) 135-6. 2 D.

I. ]</page><page sequence="10">298 Annals o/the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute History does not fail to provide a highly instructive parallel. The Authorized Version of the Holy Bible in the English of 1611 A, D. is sacred scripture to the Englishman of today. The contents of part of the work had been recorded about 1550 years earlier still in the Greek of the Apostles, translating the Aramaic and the Hebrew of the Messiah. The contente of other parts had been propounded centuries earlier still in the Hebrew of the Prophets and the Aramaic of the lesser authors. Were we unaware of this history and were there less of definiteness in the work over chronological and geographical facts, we, in this year of grace, may, with justice, be imputing the culture of the Holy Bible to the year 1611 A.D. And, there could be no effective refutation. The ßg-Veda is in worse case, through the utter deficiency in it cf geographical and chronological data. But, on that score and because of the lateness of its language, to pin down th8 origins of the culture it represents to 1300 B. 0. is no better than to find the origins of the culture of the Holy Bible in 1611 A. D. , in England, in the English language, and among Englishmen. There may, therefore, be no improbability in the Aryan of at least the age cf Concord having been as early as Proto-Harappan and of that Aryan having handed over, about 2800 B. C. , such components as Indra, Rudra, Yoga and Yaga, and, probably, hymns corresponding to those of the Rg-Veda and, perhaps, even a Collect such as that anthology itself. Perhaps it may be emphasised, even at this stage, that the terms Dravidian, Aryan and Vedic will frequently be used in this investigation not merely to express what strictly they respectively connote but also to refer to whichever people and whatever culture exhibiting substantially what, by general consent, is held to be meant, properly and strictly, by those several terms, The speculations sketched out thus are forced on us, not by the discovery of Aryan Rudra and Indra in Harappan-Dravidian, nor even by the incontinent gift of Rudra t j Harappan, -remarkable as each of them was, each in its way, -but by the refusals, as remark- able as persistent, to look in the uninterpreted vestiges of Harappan, which are innumerable, for the kinsmen of Rudra, and to look for</page><page sequence="11">Harappan : V edic : Proto- Historic 299 replicas of them all in cultures flourishing around. Surely, Rudra had cousins, near and distant, and should be found in Harappan if he had been born in MeMoMuMa or in any of its components. However, Rudra has kindred enough in Aryan, So, those who ap- prove of Dravidian for Rudra's first home have muoh to find justi- fication for: this god, Chalcolithic or pra-Chalcolithic, enters India; alone of Chalcolithic-Dravidian gods, he springs cap a pie in Chalco- lithic-Dravidian, without any antecedents in either ; he enters Aryan ; his companions do not follow him : Aryan welcomes him as a god despite features inappropriate to godhead, such as malig- nity,1 beiog present in him : this god of malevolent traits wins ßg- Vedic citizenship, not as an accession to the baud of evil ones such as Vrtra and Sambara, with whom the Aryans had to contend, but as a god : indeed, he is found in the highest positions in Aryan : this hero of the vanquished Harappans occurs as a great god of the Aryans and he battles for them against; the Dravidians for victory. What matters at this stage of the enquiry is not whether Rudra was originally Harappan or Aryan or what his significance was. We have to look for and discover the cousins he must have had in Harappan and, then, to look for the distant kindred in cultures con- temporary with Harappan, hoping that what he himself keeps silent over may be revealed by the cousins and the kindred. Indeed, the quest will naturally enlarge itself, now and again, from a search for gods, high and low, into a search in the contemporary cultures all around, including Aryan, for features of the higher culture answer- ing to those that we infer in Harappan from its having a Pasupati-Rudra-Siva in it. Nothing about Harappan may be valid that may not find confirmation in the quest. NOTE. - It has occasionally been urged that what looks the uprisen phallus of Paśupabi-Rudra-Siva in this seal ( Pi, 1, top ) is no more than the line made by the loose ends of the girdle worn by the god, but it has baen missed that the girdle itself is one of the invariable marks of the brahmacārin , the initiate who undertakes in his boyhood to live out his life in the spirit of continence. 1 A.

The sculptor would not have erred even if he had deliberately pat together the Urdhva-Medhra and the girdle-ends. The deer carved in the seat of the god is further attestation of its being as Yogi that the god in the seal was intended to be represented.8 The point will come up for elucidation lower down when the connections between Yoga, Yâga and Bhakti are gone into. 2. HA.RAPPAN : QUEST FOR CLUES Harappan Culture has been held, ever siace 1922 when its importance was realised, to be the culture of the Dravidian specie? of the Mediterranean people.3 Vedic affinities have been categorically denied. None of the reasons for the theory of non-Vedic origins is archaeological, and yet the archaeologist is the principal protagonist of the view denying the possibility of Vedic affiliations, his theory being that the Harappans, when they had settled down in their culture for a thousand years, were attacked, about 1750 B.C., by invading hordes and ignominiously overthrown, and that the invaders were the Vedic people. None the less, the archaeologist is totally at a loss to provide Mediterranean equations for the host of characters, human and animal, crowding Harappan remains, and he is equally hard put to reconcile the theory of Mediterranean origins and the simple cults of trees, animals, waters, baefcyls and the Great Mother which he finds in Harappan remains with the appearance in them of a fully Vedic god, the Daity 1 Pāraskara Grhya Sutra, 2.2. 6-12; see also, for instance, Akvalãyana Grhya Sutra, 1, 19 ; 1. 22. 1-3 ; Viąnu Smfti, 27. ; 15-8, 28; Vaststha Dharma Šāstra , 11. 58-610. a Aravarauthan, SS HC., ( 1942 ) 37-42, 65-6 ; same as NIA.

He has thought it prudent to seek no interpretation whatever of other characters ubiquitous in the relics of the culture. That it has not even occurred to him that tree-cults and the like, being equally found in other cultures, may be the common inheritance of primitive man, Mediterranean- Dravidian or Vedic or other, shows that the Mediterranean origin of Harappan culture is, to him, not a reasoned conviction but a potent obsession. An attempt is long over lue to interpret the content of some at least of the rich material that Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro have yielded. That attempt is tentatively made here. Tne modus operandi is the only one possible. Initially, the elucidation is looked for in the Mediterranean and West Asian cultures and if light from those quarters fails, - and, so, only secondarily, - an explanation is sought in other cultures. No caveat can be entered again&amp;t this method, - least of all by archaeologists who are not only not unwilling to exploit the results of the discovery of Vedic Paáupati-Rudra in 'Dravidian'- Harappan, but are even willing, as has been happening of late, to look into Vedic literature, in attempts at sweeping aside difficulties of their own making, for material which they could 'discover* to be non-Vedic. In 1908 archaeologists regretfully concurred when a Vedic scholar eaid ť From the entire Vedic period we have not one single piece of antiquarian or archaeological material, not one bit of real property ; not a building, not a monument, not a coin, jewel, or utensil, - nothing but winged words'.1 Harappan remains, discovered to be Important in 1922, and immediately recognised to belong to the third or even the fourth millennium B.

In 1947, excavators coming across 'fortifications' at Harappa concluded that they were overthrown a little before the decline of the culture, and no archaeological evidence pointed to the causes of the events, the archaeologist assumed invasions and turned to the Rg-Veda, non-chalantly disdaining the risks of setting archaeological pots, pans and * forts ' in a literary context. He arrested Indra, thrust him into the felon's dock, and declaimed a J9 Accuse , - brief and crisp, - the count being that it is he that smashed the fortressess, and the evidence being the resounding hymns of the Rg-Veda in which he is lauded as Fort-Smasher.6 While Indra stood waiting for the verdict, the prosecutor waved the jury off the box and the Black Maria off the court and himself whisked away Indra towards the cell. In 1950, the archaeologist, - another individual of the species, - subscribed to a confession, into which he interpolated a complaint, 'that tangible evidence of the Aryan conquest of India consists of nothing but the ruins of the cities they wrecked, with a few flimsy huts that may have been made by camp followers after the battle had moved on',7 but, condescendingly commending the Rg-Veda to the attention of brethren in the business, - and, 1 See Note 2 at the end of this Section. 8 See Note 3 at the end of this Section. 8 See Note 4 at the end of this Section. * Marshall, MDIC 52-6 : 12 ( 17 ). 6 V.

The egregiou&amp;ness of these theories puts into issue the validity of the systems of interpretation cf evidence of which they are the products. The tactic of the interpretation of 1931 was one of three moves of Pasupati-Rudra, the Deity-Among-Animals, on a chequer-board of white and brown, - to a white square makiüg a white Paśupati of him, to a second white square making a whita Rudra of him and, then, to a brown square t.i turn him into b brown Rudra-Siva, - and, then, of claiming all the other pieces and the whole of the board to be full and true brown. The tactic of 1955 is to throw white and brown pieces together and to allow them to move to white or brown squares as the fancy takes them and, then, to grow blind to white, whether in the pieces or in the board. Of the strategy behind the moves no more need be said than that for well over a century the practice has steadily been to go on the assumption that every Negative in regard to Vedic not only implies, but also affirmatively proves, the Positive in regard to non-Vedic, without further question or evidence. We have had various approaches tending to curious results. An example : early Vedic literature, is comparatively voluminous ; so, it must be encyclopaedic ; what is found in it may be Vedic or an intrusion ; whatever is not found in it is clearly non-Vedic : whatever being present in it is abEent in Indo-European is equally non-Vedic: whatever being absent in Vedic is present in non- Vedic Indian is ipso facto non-Vedic. A contrai y approach : Vedic thought is conditioned by the ritual of the sacrifice: whatever in Vedic is not sacrificial is non-Vedic. The crowning piece is the doctrine that even what is Vedic must be a seepage from some prehistoric, undocumented and unverifiable non-Vedic culture for the existence of which then, and for the contact of which then, with ßg-Vedic, the evidence need not be sought.</page><page sequence="17">Harappan - Vedic : Proto- Historic 305 These gratuitous assumptions, kept current for a century, have become axiomatic with those who are not given to looking into the validity of oft-repeated assertions, Even so, the assumptions cannot prove the thesis based on them except on the admirable principle that silence is testimony proving all that remains unspoken *• and, it proves that Dravidian is South-East Asian, Mongolian, Negroid and Mediterranean ! The position is taken to be quite simple : Mediterranean-Mongol-Munda-Malay is Dravidian and, ex hypcthesi, it having all that Indo-European or Vedic has not, no positive testimony to its content is needed: the content stands furnished by the hypothesis itself, that whatever is not blatantly in Indo-European or Vedic must be at least implicitly in Dravidian. And, it matters little that we know nothing positive about what could have been MeMoMuMa in the days contemporary with Indo-European or with Vedic or Harappan. Your purse being empty and my purse being full it cannot but be that my purse is full with what had once been in your purse. The fun of it does not stop here : infective is its spread. For a century, ever since the Brahuis, for the affinities of their vocabulary, were canonized into Dravidians, notwithstanding that with their 'Aryan' physiognomy they belied the distinction, there has been an acceptance of Dravidian having held sway in prehistoric times from Baluchistan t ; Cape Comorin. A title deed to this great empire was drafted and engrossed in favour of the Dravidians and signed with mid-Vicfcorian flourishes and sealed with broad wafers in a Comparative Grammar of Dravidian that appeared in 1856. There was a solemn confirma- tion of this grant, between 1922 and 1931, by archaeologists who, to fill up lacunae, gave away to Dravidian all that estate in culture that they could divest Harappan of. In 1947 the long crumbled Dravidian fortresses were restored to them an i their empire was re-established, by the pen, and, in striking, though unperceived, parallelism to the two capitals of the ancient Unified Kingdom of Egypt and to the two capitals of the divided Roman Empire, they were provided with two capitals, one at Harappa and another at Mohenjo-Daro. From 1950, however, we are being asked to look at a Harappan empire in the Paajab and in Sindb. which had no Dravidian 39 [ Annals, B. O. R.

We are invited to witness the Dravidians, newcomers to India, - from where it matters not, - chalcoliiihic like the Harappans, megalithic unlike them, arriving in Malabar or its vicinity, about 600 B. 0. , with plenty of degenerate megaliths, journeying steadily north along the west coast, sowing megaliths all along, passing Karachi and reaching the Brahui country in a few centuries and, then., for the first time, Dravidianising all the country round about Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.1 May it be permitted to us to eesay a reconciliation of the new and the cewer theories? The Dravidians of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro having been overthrown about 1750-1600 B. C , trekked through Karachi to Cairo and, collecting megaliths, sailed towards Cape Comorin, about 600 B C., and, creeping north, retur- ned to Karachi and to Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa about 300 A. D. It would add to the exuberance of the fun if a clarification were essayed that the two Dravidian peoples must have bôen originally strangers to each other. These theories are bound to fail as they are based on mere simi- larities in form and are not founded on more important considera- tions such as similarities in substance, arising from opportunities for cultural contact and willingness to receive culture elements. The true rules to guide us in the study of cultural contacts, influences and transformations may be formulated in terms both positive and negative. The capricious thinking that besets the study has tobe replaced by adherence to irrefragible principles. Firstly i All that is distinctive in, and fundamental to, a culture and all that naturally branches off therefrom cannot but pertain to that culture, notwithstanding that tlie culture, when some branching has occurred, comes to have a pattern in which there is much criss-crossing of the developments, - the crossing branches being but the developments of that culture's own untrammelled growth. My limbs, hanging loose and long, appear to be indifferent insertions into my torso : none the less, those limbs are not members that, having refractorily broken away from my neighbour's torso, have perversely run into mine. 1 C. von Fíírer-Haimendorf, in ILN , 1950 July 1, pp.24 f. ; in Indian Art and Culture, (1954 ), 238-47.</page><page sequence="19">Harappan : Vedici Pr oto- Historic 3°7 Secondly: Nothing whatever in one culture may be impu- ted to the influenoe of a second culture unless that feature is incompatible with the pattern in which it is found in the first culture, or is incapable of being a natural growth, or a transforma- tion, or even an aberration, in that culture, aûd unless there are prima facie reasons for holding that that feature could have been native in that second culture and, so, could have passed into the first Roses in a Persian garden are not gifts wafted down from Saturn, where roses, for aught we know, do not grow. Thirdly : No culture could be deemed to have influenced another unless the two have had a career in which there has been at least some over- lapping in time and space. Like the physicist the archaeologist must take note of the conditions in which alone Induced Currents start flowing. Fourthly : For a culture of any distinction to be influenced by another it is not enough that there had been contact between the two : there must at least be a receptivity or a permeability on the one side, and a penetrativeness or an aggressiveness on the other. Fish have water for habitat, but water is not fish-like and fish are not watery. These considerations aie sought to be applied in this investi- gation to the solution of the problem of the origin and the affilia- tions of Harappan culture. Opinion being unanimous against Harappan being indebted to any trans-Indian influence other than what the West Asian Ghalcolithic culture gave to it to make it Indian-Dravidian and equally against Indian-Aryan culture being accorded chronological or cultural parity with the Chalcoli- thic of either the West Asian or the Indian-Dravidian brands, it was thought best to look for yet another culture and load it with what Harappan was found to contain. That culture had to be Pre-Chalcolithic Indian-Dravidian, though of its higher content in that age not even the wildest guess was, or is, possible. In effect, it is West Asian Ghalcolithic that, on this theory, gives content and character to Indian-Dravidian-Harappan. And, yet, the distinguished characters, Pasupati-Rudra-Siva and Natarāja are untraceable in these cultures, and are found in Aryan, Common sense requires that the clue be followed up in Aryan.</page><page sequence="20">3o8 Annals o/ the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute The possibility of Harappan being explained in terms of Indian- Aryan has to be examined ana the assumptions against an earlier date for Indian-Aryan have to be reconsidered. The plan here ig to succumb to common sense. It has turned out beyond dispute in what we have surveyed that there is crying need for a reappraieemenfc of the methods of interpretation so long in vogue and of the results that they have yielded. We shall find that, though the features of minor Harappan relics may be paralleled in part in West Asian ' and Egyptian cultures, the parallelisms have not come about through borrowings, though contacts be proved. So, an origin in common basic ideas antecedent to both has to be presumed ; in any event, such an antecedency cannot be excluded. But they relate only to miuor factors. We pass on, then, and find that Harappan features have parallels in Vedic culture and that they are so close as to be explicable on only an unmistakable kinship between,- if not an identity of,- the fundamental ideas of the two cultures. We find, next, that though aspects of certain prime conceptions are virtually common to Egyptian, West Asian, Harappan and Rg-Vedic cultures, there are other aspects establishing marked - rather, vital, - differences in those same conceptions and that it is, therefore, probable that, while the similarities may be due to descent from a common and antecedent source, the differences are due to the working of the individual peculiarities of the several cultures, especially through the persistence of the ideas native to and basic in those respective cultures. It is found also that pointers to antecedent sources of considerable antiquity are not wanting. Then, attention is drawn to features in Harappan which appear to be later than Rg-Vedio culture and it is concluded that Harappan is a development in Vedic posterior to ßg-Vedic. The results are unconventional, but it looks a9 if tbeir vali- dity may be impeached only by a denial of the closeness of the resemblances between Harappan and Vedic or by a refutation of the principles underlying this investigation.</page><page sequence="21">Harappan : V edic : Proto- Historic 309 NOTE 1 - These views are apparently R.

ANIMALS IN-HA.RAPP AN, WEST ASIAN AND EGYPTIAN From such remains of Harappan culture as have been montpolising attention in the past thiity years we shall turn to others which, though they have remained unnoticed, turn out to be decisive in significance. Notwithstanding the popularity, in Harappan, of the human form for the gode, tbe forms of beasts and birds and, perhaps, of lower creatures too, were utilised to depict the gods in.1 The conclusion that the biomorphs represented in the seals pertaining to this culture were treated with reverence, if not treated also to worship, is inevitable, owing to the excellence, the formalnees and the gravity with which they are depicted being superfluous were they merely for lay purposes. A piece of sculpture, in the round, of a composite animal has also turned up which, though small in size, could scarcely have served any puipose but that of being set up in a niche in a house for domestic worship.2 In these we have evidence which tells, as clearly as may be expected, of images of animals having been installed in temples and devoirs paid to them. One of the sealings (Fig. 34b) records a scene which cannot but be interpreted as that of a lion, regardant, being stood, at the extreme right, on a pediment of two tiers, and under a roof curv- ing over the animal's head, - a cross-section of a simple shrine, - a gateway, immediately to the left, litttle different from the torana we are familiar with as occurring in connection with Buddhist stupas, a great animal, perhaps an elephant bearing a howdah, passing through the gate towards the shrine, a Yogi seated on a high pedestal in the middle of the scene, and, at the left, another lion regardant, and, further beyond, a human being. There can be little doubt over this being a picture of a scene enacted in the presence of a lion-deity enshrined in a temple. Further evidence for Harappan temples will be referred to lower down. 1 No selection of examples can do justice to the wealth of the material that has turned up. A careful perusal of the plates of illustrations in the stan- dard books on the excavations is a sine qua non to the appreciation oi what the culturé stands represented in.

Other biomorphs too wandered in the Harappan zoo, playing divine roles. Among these are the Octopede ( Fig. 40 ) and what may be the Sea-Horse (Fig. 36). While the Bull took pride of plice, - not in one form alone but in three1 - the Cuw does not appear in her own proper person, though the Coar -Unicorn is present. The Tiger- like animal, in one of the seals ( Fig. 34b ), without the stripes pro- minent in a few other representations of the animal in the seals - always depicted as looking back over its shoulder, - has to be accepted for the Lion, notwithstanding tte general view that the King of Beasts is unknown in these vestiges.8 Fantasy too determined the forms : we have combinations of human being and beast, as in Man-Lion, Bull-Lion-Man, Tiger-Man, and Tiger-Woman ( Figs. 13-4 ), of beast and bird, as in Ox-Bird, and of beast and beast, in such integrations as Bull-Tiger, Dog-Rhinoceros, Antelope-Horse-Rhinoceros, Bull- Elephant-Ram, Bull- Elephant-Rhinoceros and Bull-Elepb ant- Tiger ( Figs. 11, 12, 15, 59 ), t j mention only the simpler of the combinations. Characters with two heads or three were also not unknown ( Figs. 27, 28 ). Beasts joined back to back occur in some tablets. ( Fig. 61 ). Of a greater number of ingredients is composed a fantasy- beast ( Figs. 16-8 ).3 Basically a compound of the torso and the horns of the Bull, the trunk and the tusks of the.

Still further elaborations are also recognizable, - those in which the torso of the Antelope is, perhaps, substituted for that of the Bull,1 or th9 visage of Man is super-added.2 Fractions of four beasts going to make up most specimens of this animal, this Quadripartite Beast is es complicated an amal- gam as any contraption of myth. Equally complicated indeed is another complex creature,-- the Unicorn.3 Because of the frequency with which it appears and of the constancy with which it sticks to a norm it has all the appea- rance of being the conception of composite deity characteristic of the culture ( Figs. 19-20). So successfully does the creature conterfeit nature that it hes been generally taken for one of nature's animals, the Bull, perhaps, of Urus btock,4 with head so held that the two horns merge deceptively into one.5 But, the animal is a veritable cheat. The resemblance of the eye in some of the representations to the eye of the Camel, although recognised at the beginning,6 was soon overlooked in the assumption of the animal being only a Bull.7 More *. the dismalness of the visage and the absolutely horizontal poise of head held aloft, characteris- tic of the Camel and its kind, have gone unnoticed. Even more unrecognised, but equally patent, are the neck and the general posture of the compos te animal. The neck, rising at a steep angle from the withers, runs up into a cone, - the lower outline being straight, and the upper arching in a light curve, - and joins the head, at the nape, in a marked curve, - features that are distinctive in the Horse The general posture, also, of the composite beast is more that of the Horse than of the Bull. Occasionally, too, the shins and the hoofs are unmistakably equine.8 Indeed, it may be said that while the appearance of the rear half of the beast is a Bull's, that of the front half is a 1 Marshall, MDIC : 112 ( 381 ). a Marshall, MDIC.,-: 112 ( 380 ) ; Vats, EH., - : 91 ( 249 ), for examples. 8 See Note 4 at the end of this Seotion. 4 Mackay, FE MD., 326. 6 See Note 5 at the end of this Section. 6 Marshall, MDIC., 68, 382. 7 Marshall, MDIC, 383. 8 Marshall, MDIC 103 ( 15, 16, 18, 37, 141, 142 eto. ).</page><page sequence="25">Harappan : V edic &gt; Proto- Historic 31 $ Horse's, with a touch of that of the Camel, and that the pose of the animal as a whole is indubitably the Horse's. The solitary horn that rises from the head of the animal is one of the features that serve at once to invest it with marked individuality and to mislead. The short transverse lines which cut across the animal's horns along the full length, in many of the beasts, ( Figs. 19, 22 ) are inexplicable except as inefficient attempts at rendering the protuberant rings that are common in the horns of some varieties of the Antelope. Such marking is absent along the horns of the animal in many cases, but there are also Antelopes that have no rings in their horns. It has been held that the animal is really two-horned, though it looks one-horned because of so holding its head, when giving sittings to the engraver, that the nearer horn hides the farther frotn view,1 but, this is palpably unsustainable, as the engraver would ordinarily not have chosen to represent a quite unusual pose in innumerable examples. That a second horn is seen in only five out of the very large number of seals bearing the animal as device is proof, not of the archetype having been two-horned, but of the impishness of Harappan fancy, which sought, apparently, to ring changes in the standard type of the complex beast which we have found the Unicorn to be, and, in the exceptional examples, gave the beast one horn of the Brahmani Bull in addition to the Unicorn's characteristic horn ' Fig. 25 )2 or doubled the characteristic horn3 or substituted a pair of Bull's horns for the horn of the double curve ( Fig. 26 ).4 ( The compounding of the mixture is illustrated in Fig. 54 ). The illusion of the animal being one of nature's genuine offspring being thus broken, the animal becomes recognizable as an amalgam of Bull, Horse, Camel5 and Antelope. Only one instance have we of the conception of an animal head crowning a human torso* it is in a seal picturing the torso of a man, apparently a dancer ( Fig. 32 ), crowned with a buffalo's head, complete with spiead horns. 1 Cf.

It is to the demons that in West Asia the animal form was assigned. The deities of Egypt were represented by animals. The human form, unmodified by bestial features, was common. So too the zoomorph, in bestial combinations. Sopdu, for instance, was crouching Falcon or winged Bee. The human form had sometimes an alternative in which a bestial component was added to the human: Anupis was Jackal, or Man and Jackal ; Wepawet wa9 She-Wolf, or Woman and She-Wolf ; Serek was Crocodile, or Man and Crocodile. The Sphinx, - reclining Lion with the face of Man, - was one of the few gods who was not compelled to have a merely bestial shape. Woman was combined with Lion to give Tefnut, and with Frog to yield Heket, and with Scorpion to make Serquic: she was decked with the horns of Antelope to evoke Satis. Man with Hawk-beak or with Ram-head became Khnum. Integration of beasts was also not uncommon. Falcon with Cat's head became Bastet, while with Ram's bead it became also Khnum. Montu was Man bearing two Falcon heads side by side. Khnum, apparently a variety artist, found delight in wearing also four Ram heads. A combina- tion of three components was also not unknown • Set, who was Man bearing the head of his special Animal, was given the head of Falcon too when he was united into one body with Horus. The god of Hermopolis was Man with Lion's head and Mule's ears. Rarely, the animals were put together back to back,- the foreparts of two Lions being thus united to represent Aker. Integrations of the Sun and the Moon were also common : Bull with Sun-Disc between its horns was Hathor ; Falcon-beaked Man crowned with Sun-Disc was Re ; Ibis-beaked Man bearing Creecent-Moon and Sun-Disc was Thotb. Horus's Sun-Disc added to itself the wings of Falcon. The similarities and the differences in the modes in which divinities and demons were represented in these three cultures emerge with great clarity. For the gods, anthropomorphism and theriomorphiem were equally accepted in Egypt and in Harappa,</page><page sequence="27">Harappan : V edic : Proto- His lorie 3 1 5 and so too was ail integration of the two methods of representation. West Asia was pranouncedly in favour of anthropomorphism for the gods, though, perhaps, yielding to fcheriomorphism in excep- tional instances. For the demons, Egypt had, in effect, no mode of representation different from what it had for the gods : West Asia reserved animal forms for the demons : we have no means of picking out the demons of Harappa. No significance may be attached to the variations in the animals playing divine or demo- niac roles in these cultures : if, for instance, the Hippopotamus is utilised by Egypt, the Rhinoceros is thrust into the foreground by Harappa, which lacks the Hippopotamus. The poiiit has been made more than once that the Tiger is known, and the Lion is unknown, to Harappa, but, - even if this Le corre jt, which is not the ca^e, - little of cultura-value has been shown to turn on the distinction. Nor may such significance be imported into the presence of the Horse and the Camel in Harappan culture and their absence in the Egyptian : it is not to be assumed that what these animals stood for in Harappa were not represented by other animals in Egypt. Nonetheless, striking differences in the working of the Harappan and the Egyptian minds emerge on even a cursory study of the convergences and divergences. While the Harappan ordinarily affixed a human head, or face, to an animal body, the Egyptian preferred the converse process. It was, however, no matter of principle : the Man-Buffalo ( Fig. 32) is indistinguishable in style from the rest of the finds. The Harappan, unlike the Egyptian, did not bring the Sun, the Moon or other celestial body into the incorporations. While the Egyptian did not go beyond putting three, or exceptionally, four components together, Harappan fancy appears to have set no limits to itself and, if an incorporation of more than seven ingre- dients has not been noticed in Harappan representations, it may be only because theie are limits to the ability of the engraver, or sculptor, to achieve distinctness in depicting fractions of animals in the little pieces that alone have survived. That Egypt is the product of the unification of the Two Egypts is all t. o apparent in the representations we have been studying, whereas no dichotomy of any kiod is traceable in the Harappan representations.</page><page sequence="28">3t6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Note i - The reader may glance through the illustrations in the standard works : Marshall, MDIC., pls.

There was a feeling that the Horse too might have been the Camel's contemporary. The position that Harappan is pre-Vedic imposed an obligation to close the eye to at least the Horse in Harappan, it being the animal par excellence of Vedic ; so, the Horse in the Unicorn was blinked;out.</page><page sequence="29">Harappan : Vedici Proto- Historic 317 Note 6 - Megasthenes makes mention of a Unicorn which, perhaps, he saw in the vicinity of Patna. It was, according to him, a composite of an Elephant and a Horse, with one long horn. Apparently the better of the manuscripts from which we derive our knowledge of the text of Megasthenes spelt the name of the beast as 'Kartazon'. The original of this name could, in Sanskrit, be 'Karyasvam', compounded of 'Kari', Elephant, and cAsva', Horse. The compound word, with the indicia of liaison et cetera thrown in, transformed into the local Patna dialect, modified by the unphilological pair of ears of Megasthenes and yet further trans- muted by Greek scribes unfamiliar with Sanskrit, - even ignorant of the name having come from Sanskrit, - might, appear in the Greek manuscripts in the corrupt form in which it has kept scholars puzzled for a century, - through which the account of Mega sthenes has been crying for recognition. If the fragment from Megasthenes does not allow us to declare that he had indeed set his eyes on the beast, it cannot either be asserted that he was speaking only from hearsay. On the probability of the animal of his account having existed in his time we may have t^o opinions, but if we are to find an explanation of how Megasthenes had at least come to believe that there might really have been an animal of that kind wandering about in the 'Eastern Country', we cannot do better than conjecture that in that country there were then found seals of the Harappan type with a device in them which figured the 'Karyasvam* as a variant of the Harap pan Unicorn. The implications of this suggestion deserve to be fully gone into. 4. MORE ABOUT THE ANIMALS Nothing, is clearer than that there is little probability of signi- ficant borrowings among these three cultures that spread from the Nile to the Ganga. The few similarities between the products of these cultures may novV be looked into to decide whether the resemblances point to close contact or identity. Many of the Unicorns of Harappan wear a long collar fashion- .ed of rings of withe, or wire, and set so close together as to look</page><page sequence="30">3 18 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute all of one piece ; perhaps, the collar is of wire or withe wound spirally without interspacing between the spirals ( Fig. 21 ). In rare instances the collar is interlaced J1 in two specimens it is in two sections, a lower and an upper, fitted together.2 Occa- sionally, the collar is only a necklet ( Fig. 20 ) ; frequently it covers the neck ; sometimes it runs down to the chdst3 or up to the nostrils ( Fig. 22 ).4 Less distinguished animals, too, of the cul- ture wear collars, more or less similar.5 The Bull- Elephant- Ram-Horse-Goat-Tiger-Scorpion beast too sports curious neck- wear, part collar, part garland ( Figs. 16- 8 ).6 Parallel to the Harappan collar is the long collar round the neck of the Animal of Set figured in a comb from Naqada in Egypt (Fig. 72), 7 of a period before 3000 B. C.8 Elaborations are the interlaced collars, sometimes running down the torso* too, worn by animals carved in some Early Dynastic seals from West Asia.9 The placing of a tub before the animals in Harappan seals ( Figs. 1, 2, 4-6 ) has parallels in the setting of a bowl with, perhaps, smoke rising from it, in front of the Buck of Mendes10 and of an altar-piece before the Buohis Bull,11 in Egyptian sculptures which, however, may not be comparably ancieut. The placing of a tall object before ths up-raised head of the Unicorn ( Figs. 19-26 ), is paralleled in the placing of a tall object,- a plant or a *mike'-^ before animals in antiquities from Kalli ( Baluchistan and Early Dynastic Susa.13 The objects set before the Unicorns are in i Marshall MDIC.t- : 105 ( 41 ). 8 Mackay, FEMD, - : 95 ( 440 ) ; 99 ( 674 ). ü Marshall, MD1C, - : 105 ( 44, 48, 49 ); perhaps even farther, /5. - : 109 ( 2 &gt;6 ). * Marshall, MDIC* - : 104 ( 25, 33, 38 ). ß Marshall, MD1C : 111 ( 350 ). 6 For examples, see Marshall, MDIC,- : 112 ( 377-81 )» 7 S.

The lower one is un-under- standable except; as a vessel which has its counterpart in the tub before the other animals. The upper portion occurs in two types which differ ( Figs 19, 20, 22- 4, differing from Figs. 21, 25), though but little, from each other. To "judge by the length of the pole below the lower section, the object was intended both to be planted in front of the animal deity when it was stationary and to be carried about and aloft when the deity was peripatetic. That in this cul- ture there were both an animal deity carried about on a pole, as in the nome standards of Egypt, and a vessel-cum-parasol held high on a pole and carried beside or behind the deity is attested to in interesting seals (Fig. 37-8). 1 Apparently, the vessel was intended for holding food-offerings of no great weight for the god and could, therefore, be held hoisted easily with its contents. The upper half of the vessels in those specimens wherein that half closes in a curve or a dome ( Figs. 21, 25 )2 could be a parasol, perùaps like the sun-shade figured behind the Scorpion King in his Mace, one of early Egypt's sculptural master-pieces, or, equally probably, could be an umbrella fashioned of cane and pleated fabric, serving for ceremonial cover for the vessel, shading the offer- ing in it from profane sight and other contamination. In the other specimens ( Figs. 19, 20, 22-4 ), the uppar half could be the roll into which had been wound a long screon of figured cloth used as simitar shade. Parasols, screens and shades of similar shapes are in use to this day in the Hindu temples of at least South India when the vessels holding offerings are brought, borne by attendants on their heads, from the kitchen of the temple to the holy presence. Vessel and parasol were perhaps combined at Harappa into one unit. While most of the tubs are set on the ground before the animals, in contrast to the elaborate offering-vessels, one or two ( Figs. 2, 6 ) are shown supported on what looks a short peg.3 It may be that the peg is only the visible portion of a 1 Marshall MDlC.t 38-5 : 116 (5,8), 118 ( 9 ) ; Vats, EH.,-. 93 ( 309 ); also Note 1 at the end of this Section. 2 Marshall MD1C : Ill ( 345, 351 ). 3 Compare, the peg-foofced vases from Dene^ { Danubian region ) ; V.

We do not know whether the animal deities before whom the humble tubs were placed were of much less consequence than the Unicorn and were, so, denied the distinction of being taken in festive processions. While Łhe placing of vessels before cult animals and the carrying of animal-representations on high poles with offering vessels are clearly common to both Egyptian and Harappan cultures, they do not appear to have had a contemporary vogue in West Asian, unless the * standards ' from Alaca Huyuk, of about the early second millennium B. C. , in which some animal or other, with a variously shaped and pierced screen for back- ground, is affixed to some object which would display the animal prominently, could be taken to be survivals of much earlier specimens. On one of the two faces of a seal from Harappa ( Fig. 33a )* is depicted a nude human figure standing on its head, - or, it may be, lying on its back, - but with legs stretched apart : from bet- ween the legs issues a globular object, bearing on either side what might be a pair of bent limbs, while two figures, each a man- cum-animal, stand some distance away, but together. On the other face ( Fig. 33b ) is shown a figure, nude, seated, legs thrust out and arms thrown up, about to be attacked by a figure armed with a sickle-like weapon. The former of the two scenes has been taken to be one of the Earth Goddess giving birth to plants and the latter fco be one of a murderous attack on a woman. The nearest paral- lel in the cultures to the west of India comes from Egypt, where 'the earth was pictured as a man lying on his beily ( according to other accounts, on his back ), out of whose back things grew, and who was surrounded by an ocean'.2 The resemblance does not bear being pressed. While the Egyptian idea is that of the i Marshall, MDIC., 52: 12 ( -2 ) ; Vats, EH.,- : 93 ( 304 ). Wheeler feels it might be crocodile. 10. ( 1953 ), 80, but this is highly improbable as the object is muoh more round than a crocodile can possibly be. 8 Occasionally, Osiris is shown lying extended with face upward, turned with stalks of corn rising from his body ; Mercer, op. citn 103, fig. 20.</page><page sequence="33">Harappan : Vedici Proto- Historic 321 earth being prone and wide, the Harappan is that of the birth of offspring from a parent in the pains of labour. The object issuing from the womb of the recumbent figure in the Harappan seal cannot be taken for a plant, at least because of the distinct cone at the free end. This figure is much closer to a tortoise, or a turtle, the cone being the head, poorly differentiated from body, the bent limbs being the legs of a tortoise that bend when it is on the move or the flappers of a turtle which bend when it is aswim, and the tail being either the tail of the turtle or the afterbirth with which the tortoise had emerged from the maternal womb. The scene on the other face of the seal is the sequel : the parent, having sat up and brought the outspread legs together, is about to be set upon and slaughtered. The legend too on both faces is the same. The two scenes run apparently into one story, - a parent of outstretched legs giving birth to strange offspring and, then, facing an onslaught, with the imminent sequel of slaughter. The idea in the Harappan seal seems to be different from that of the Egyptian myth, but it is not to be missed that the Egyptian parent is surrounded by the ocean and that the turtle of the Harappan seal has a watery habitat The two conceptions may have had origins that perhaps lie much below the surface.1 Another scene in a Harappan saal ( Fig. 34a ) shows a man leading an animal, evidently a Bull, with head and horns held ominously low, past what may be a post crowned with a trident, to a man seated in the porch of a small rectangular building, comprising no more than one room in all probability, and no more than one storey in height, built of what must be blocks of stone laid in courses distinctly differentiated, and covered over with a flat roof which extends also over the poroh. At the corners of the main structure rise finials indistinct in shape. The post with the trident atop may correspond to a flagstaff with a flag emblazoned with a trident. It being likely that every citizen had a right in ancient times to fly a flag of his own there is not enough basis for making out the building tobe a shrine, in preference to a private house. Egyptian shrines, however, of the earliest 1 Compare Fig. 89, which comes ffom E. A. Speiser, Excavations at Tepe Gawra ( 1935 ), 1 : 121-2 : 56 ( 3 ). 41 [ Annals, B. O. K. I. 1</page><page sequence="34">122 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute days seem to have been similar to the Harappan structure, porch included, (Fig. 69 ) and what imaga was set up in the Egyptian shrine seems to have been located in the porch ( Fig 33c ). The inference is strengthened by the occurrence, already noticed, of the scene of the lion in a shrine ( Fig. 34b ). It is not to be ignored that the two scenes are pictured back to back on a pot-sherd. This examination of affiliations makes it clear that, while of parallels between Harappan and West Asian there are no striking instances, similarities between Harappan and Egyptian are unmistakable. Indeed, in the Animal of Set itself we find features to which we have as many as three interesting parallels in Harappan designs ; the parallel of the long collar is one of them • that the long tail of the Heptartite beast of Harappa is shown rising vertically may be only because the need for maintaining the square format of the Harappan seal suggested the alteration of the angle at which the tail of the Set Animal strikes out : the tripartite tip of the Set Animal's tail it is that might be the earliest analogue of the pair of prehensors appearing almost; at the end of the Heptartifce Harappan animal's tail. The similarities are not confined to tail-tips, collars and feed- tubs. They extend to anthropomorphism and theriomorphism. The£0, however, need not mean much as evidence for culture origins or contacts, for both of them have birth in a common human nature. Even the presence of temples in all three cultures is no te&amp;timöny, for anthropomorphism and theriomorphism imply at least domestio shrines and point to public temples, neither of which need bo deemed native in ono culture and borrowing in another. Not even such similarity as we have so far found to subsist between the ideas of- Creation in Egyptian and Harappan can be evidence, for the ideas we have so far noticed are too basic for them not to have had a common ancestry of much earlier days. The evidence that can prove contacts has to be essentially different. Not unless, for instance, the character which in Egypt is represented in the Bull occurs in Harappan as Bull, - or at least in a variant or an equivalent of the Bull, - nor unless the offering vessel? of Egypt and Harappa attest to a common attitude and</page><page sequence="35">Bar appari : Vedic : Proto -Historic 323 approach to deities similarly conceived, may the flow of influence from either one of the cultures to the other ba claimed. No paral- lelisms in the Egyptian, West Asian and Harappan cultures such as would substantiate a suggestion that Harappan owed anything significant to the other two cultures present themselves for consi- deration. To rely for evidence on the vogue of the Tree, the Animal and the Mother cults and the like at Harappa is fco err doubly : it is to igņore the primitive origins of Harappan, even denying to it survivals from an earlier stage of life : it is also to deny to it credit for the superior validity which it gave to its advanced beliefs, faiths and ways of thought thai; alone could be consistent with the highly developed material culture which we are privileged to witness in it. Most of th a feat ares in Harappan remains for which parallels have been found in Egyptian and West Asian cultures relate only to designs and to craftmanship.1 They may point to trade in artifacts but they prove neither blood-and-bone propinquity nor the give and take of culture elements. The only parallels of cultural interest that have been pointed to are two scenes embody- ing the motifs of Warrior Combating Beasts and Hunter Hastening after Quarry,2- but these can be evidence of neither the migration t &gt; Harappa of the legends of West Asian Enkidu and Gïlgamesh nor of the rise in India of legends pattarned after them as a result of We^t Asian inspiration : the utmost they may establish is that to depict Indian legends a pictdrial formula or two of West Asian art were borrowed. 3 Thus, of suggestions for the elucidation of4he sources of the culture at the stage in which we find it about 2500 B. C, or 2000 B. C. we have had none, - not even on the hypothesis of Mediterranean and West Asian influences. Nothing western has elucidated anything significant in Harappan. To look more diligently and closely into the earlier oř the contemporary cultures on Indian soil itself, -in what we know for Mediterranean-Dravidian culture, -for clues to the origin and 1 fieferenoes to these are furnished in the Index to Mackay, FEMD. (1938), under 'Egypt'. 2 Marshall, MD1C, ( 1931 ), 76. " 26,67, 76,87:13 ( 17 ), 111 ( 356-7).</page><page sequence="36">324 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute development of Harappan culture is the next course. The attempt is, however, foredoomed to futility for two reasons. Firstly, though the content of Mediterranean culture» in lands to the west of the Indus region and of about 2300-2000 B.C. when Harappan is mature, is fairly well-known, no elucidation has come from it, as we have just seen. Of the content of Mediterranean culture to the east or south-east of the Indus, that is, the MeMoMuMa of the age of Harappan culture, we have not the least knowledge. Secondly, we may turn to the Dravidian of the India of historic times for parallels, but historic Dravidian is claimed to be badly contami- nated with Vedic and 'megalithic' cultures, precluding, thus, the possibility of deciding whether any significant feature is Medi terranean or Vedic or South-East Asian. This requires conjectures also such as that South-East Asian was a culture which was, then, more advanced than Vedic and Dravidian and had, therefore, a greater appeal to the Dravidian people. Assumptions more despe- rate, on the evidence now available, may h&amp;rdly be thought of. 5. ANIMALS IN HARAPPAN AND VEDIC Egyptian, West Asian, and Mediterranean-Dravidian cultures having, thus, failed us, it is clearly perverse not to turn for elucidation to tho only other culture of ancient Asia of any importance with which Harappan could be connected, at least geographically, - the Vedic. For our immediate purpose and at this stage of th3 investiga- tion, it is immaterial whether we take Vedic culture to be later or to te earlier, or we make it contemporary. If Vedic culture is found to illumine dark Harappan corners we may, thereon, turn to a canvassing of whether the light comes from the before or the after. The animals of Harappan and Vedic conspire to give us the light we need. Bg-Vedic man did not fail to find manifestations of a Supreme Being in the various activities of nature and in their orderliness and, what is more, in all those responses of his own to them enabling him to lead a full and fair life in their midst. Such, for instance, are the natural phenomena associated with the sun. Such also are the ideas of cosmic order and sin and Grace.</page><page sequence="37">Harâppan : Vedic : Proto- Historic 325 The manifestations and responses got personified in his mind in anthropomorphes such as Surya (San), Rta (Cosmic Order), Tapas ( Ardour ), and Yajña ( Sacrifice ). Fancy, playing with these personifications, expressed itself in similes. The sun was compared to the bull, for brightness of aspect and vigour of fecundation. Then, personification and simile fusing together, Surya, sun, turned into the similitude of the simile and became the Bull. The sun and the horse being both noted for nobility of aspect, lustre and speed, fancy turned Surya into the similitude also of the Horse. The process may well be called Simile-Similitudism.1 And fancy, growing yet more exuberant, could put the two similitudes together and lepresent Surya in a Bull-Horse. So it is that the Rg-Veda teems with chants in which its gods are spoken of in terms of animals, birds and insects, and even in terms of inanimate objects. It is of the first importance that this aspect of the working of the Vedic mind should be thoroughly understood. The process starts with a simple simile, a mere comparison of a god with an animal or inanimate object, explicitly stating the feature which suggests the comparison. You, O wise ( Indra ), carry a long hook that looks spear and ( you holdfast therewith ), as a goat catches a branch with its fore- foot.

Simile-Similitudism, - as we may call this psychological process, - has nothing in common with those processes we associate with Animism and Animatism and the like.</page><page sequence="41">Har appūn : Vedic : Proto- Historic 329 Similarities to the Bull were seen not only in Sûrya1 butin Agni,2 Indra,3 Parjanya,4 Sorna,5 Dyaus,6 ītta,7 Rudra8 and Visņu9 also, and each of them is called the Bull. The converse process is also at work : Agni ( Fire ), for instance, having quali- ties for which apt similes could be found in the appearance and the activities of various animals, is equated readily to the Bull,10 the Horse,11 the Lion12 and the Serpent13 and the Śyena ( Eagle ),u and the Swan *.15 indeed he is once said to be Lion or Bull,16 and is once called Bull and Cow, in the same breath 17 Soma is com- pared to the Buffalo, the Eagle, the Hatchet, a god and a sage, - all in one verse.18 The sequel to this ever active and restless play of fancy is fantasy, for, a Vedic artist, adding a touch of anthropo- morphism with his brush, could pòrtray Agai in combinations such as Bull-Man, Bull-Lion-Man, Horse-Lion-Man or Bull- Lion-Horse-Serpent- M an.

The udder that she displays must, therefore, be a feature taken over from a mammalian Cow. The simpler of the complex animals of Harappa, such as Bull-Man and Lion-Bull-Man, are suscêptible of being identified with Rg-Vedic gods, for each is but an anthropomorphization of an integration of two or more of the deities which we have found the Bull, the Lion and other animals to stand for. It may be that Bull and Bird being, together, compared to Surya, that god was represented in a Bull-Bird, Closer identifications of these concep- tions, however, are hard to ventura on, "Çg-Vedic fancy working with kaleidoscopic whimsicality, and knowledge of the working of the Harappan mind having yet to be picked up. For the same reason we are not immediately in a position to appreciate the significance of the more complex beasts. But, our study of the finds has helped us to a better understanding and when we turn to the complex representations again we hope to elucidate them better.

J.1 It has been suggested that the dancer ( PL 2, r. ) might be Natarāja : he would be good company for the Rudra-Siva who has been found in the Paàupati-Rudra-Siva seal (PL 1, top ). Both the statuettes are of stone and are small in dimensions: both are undoubtedly representations of males, though the dancer looks effeminate : both are nude. Both are deliberately sculptured to represent only the torao, though in the dancer the upper portions of the four limbs are also sculptured. They both bear marks to show that they are no more than basic stocks which, by the addition of heads and limbs, could be developed and completed into full-fledged figures, it being a familiar practice in icono] atry to keep a set of adjuncts ready to hand and to stick them variously to the basic figure to produce a variety of emanations of a god, each in a different physical form and pose.8 Though a variety of heads exhibiting different visages and a variety of limbs illustrating different poses must have lain in the Harappan repertoire,3 there is no knowing what the heads and the limbs looked like or into what semblances they would have transformed the basic figurine. There is one marked difference, however, between the two figures. The statuette that is merely a torso ( PL. 2. 1. ) has suffered the utter loss of the phallus, though the scrotum remains intact. That the loss was through violence, and not through accident, is betrayed by the fracture having occurred at the very root of the phallus and by the edges of the fracture being quite raw. In the other statuette ( PL 2, r. ) the pubes, male or female, are wholly absent and, where they ought to be, there is scooped out a socket which, is too wide deep and plain to simulate a woman's pudendum. The figure that through violence has sustained the loss of the phallus ( PL 2, 1 ) has been recognised to have been iihyphallic.4 1 Marshall, MDlC.y ( 1931 ), 44-7 : llf 12. 2 Aravamuthan, in JBRS .

Marshall, MDIC., 46.</page><page sequence="45">Harappan : V edic : Proto- Historic ļļļ There is a tenseness in the muscles of the scrotum which is unmistakable and it should have been shared by the phallus, for an emotion that so markedly affected the scrotum could not but have affected the phallus and, made it, in its tu- mescence, part company from the scrotum. Whatsoever the appearauces and the roles into which the figurine could have b3en transformed by variations in heads and limbs it had, still, to be presented unvaryiogly as a character that had a sex organ obstinately priapic, unless it b9 that the breaking off of the insurgent priapus could have been part of the design of the sculptor, his aim having been to represent a personage who, prone to unwanted accesses of passion, had wrenched off the priapic inconvenience. In the other figurine ( PL 2, r. ) the socket in the pubic region was provided, it has been suggested, to receive the stump of an uprisen organ carved in a separate piece.1 But, if it was only ithyphallicism that had required indication the turgid organ could well have been sculptured as an integral feature of the statuette, as had been done in the other statuette. A socket was needed only if stumps of different kinds of addenda and frequent changes of the addenda were contemplated. There could, therefore, be little doubt but that this statuette was deliberately designed to receive the stumps of at least three addenda, one at a time, each showing the phallus in one of three positions, - hanging down, staying horizontal and standing vertical. Apparently, the statuette that has irretrievably lost the phallus that had jutted forward ( PI. 2, 1. ) is only a particular case of the statuette of three-fold role ( PI. 2, r. ). Indeed, this latter statuette, because of the socket, is even more versatile than appears at first sight. The scrotum not having been sculptured integrally in the statuette and the socket being much larger than is needed to accommodate only the stump of the penis, a number of probabilities present themselves for consideration. One is that the affixes bore probably representations of preposte- rously large penises in one of three positions, but without the scro- tum hanging behind. Another is that the affix incorporated a big 1 See Note at the end of this Section.</page><page sequence="46">334 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute phallus in one of the three positions, with the scrotum in the background. Another is that the affix could be a representa- tion of a woman's pudenda, - this being a hypothesis that accounts riot only for the absence of the scrotum as an integral pait of the sculpture and for the large size of the socket but also for the marked effeminacy of the statuette, of which the breasts look those of a girl at the onset of maturity. Male or female at will was apparently the role of the Dancer. Thus, for an evaluation of these two statuettes we have to take note of quite a variety of the phenomena of sex as manifested in the sex- organs. A weil-known Egyptian myth tells of how in the struggle be- tween Horus the Elder, god of the sky, and Set, inveterate enemy of the gods, Set tore out the eyes of Horus and, in turn, Horus laid violent hands on the testicles of Set, of how Thoth intervened and cured the wounds of both and of how Seťs testicles were then tied on to him. Another Egyptian myth tells of Osiris, god of nature, being killed and cut to pieces by Set, of the victim's wife, Isis, seeking out and putting together the scattered pieces and reviving the husband, but, sad to say, sans the genitals which, for all her wifely diligence, she could not recover. Hittite, or, Hurrian, legend tells of a conflict in which Kumarbis, dragging Anus, first among the gods, down from the sky, bit off his privies and swallowed part of them and of that part, turning, in his sto- mach, into three dreadful gods who, in emerging from that prison, effected the disruption and death of Kumarbis. Well known is the Greek myth of Uranus having been deprived of his genitals by his sons, the Titans, instigated to the offence by their mother, Earth. A Phrygian tale has it that At'jis deprived himself of his genitals under a pine tree and bled to death. There is little of defmiteness in these tales on points such as whether Isis missed the scrotum also in missing the penis, whether Attis deprived himself of penis or scrotum or both, and whether Kumarbis's disruptors having been the three cods sprung from his obscene meal, ti e meal itself had been of three dishes,-* a penis and two testicles, - and whether, therefore, the loss of Anus had not been of all three items, though the tale appears to say that it is only a part of the privies of Anus that Kumarbis swallowed.</page><page sequence="47">Hatappan - Vedic : Proto- Historic 335 The reason for wishing we had more of these details, obscene though they appear, should not be hard to infer. A loss of the scrotum means the loss of the power to fecundate with fruitful seed and to secure the pleasure of progeny : a loss of the penis affects the power to enact sex-congress and to derive sex- pleasure, and not only the power to fecundate, the ability to place the seed being lost with the loss of the organ. To fail to advert to the difference is to run the risk of misunderstanding the purpose of each of the tales. The Harappan statuettes sans phalli make two affirmations, - that they had had the ability to have their fill of pleasure ( having been ithv phallic ), and that they had abjured that pleasure (the phalli being discarded or discardable, or for other reasons, as will appear presently ). This motif of an abnegation of sex pleasure is not to be found in any of the tales we have recounted above. It is futila to dismiss these as Fertility myths. For this reason at least we have to turn to Vedic culture looking for the light which we miss elsewhere. Note - An apt illusttration of the underlying idea is found in a Buddhist text : c Now at that time a cerain Bhikkhu tormented by distaste ( for meditation etc. ) castrated himself. They told this matter to the Blessed One, ( who remarked ) : When one thing wanted cutting off, O Bhikkhus, that foolish fellow has cut off another 'x What had needed cutting off was the distaste for self-control, compelementary to the taste for self-indulgence, which it was that was stirring the sex impulse. Castration, instead of extinguishing desire, would be merely driving it into other channels, for, without removing the root of desire, it reduces to futility the instrument of desire. 1 Vinaya : Culla-vagga , 5. 7. 1.</page><page sequence="48">336 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 7. PHALLIC PHENOMENA AND RENUNCIATION Vedic thought played with phantasies connected with certain of the physical phenomena of sex, - the tumescence as well as the flaccidity of the phallus, the adequacy or the superfluity of the prepuce, the lustrousness of the glans penis in moments of tumescence and the retention of se¿d. The prudish reader has to endure a frank expose of the fantasies if he is to understand the fall import of the views, on matters such as ithyphallicism, of a people who lived so close to nature that it mattered little to them if even their fantasies had the imprint of crude nature on them. It may be, however, some comfort to puritans to be told in advance that the obscenity is an all too natural a mask for a high ethic. Sex-passion, in its intensity, evokes a tumescence in the phallus so pronounced that the membrum virile, r jused from the nadir of sex-languour, lifts itself and describes the quadrant that brings it to the horizontality of unsated desire. It may be that a strong and inflexible will, bent upon the confounding of desire, exerts itself strenuously to keep the fires of passion under control. Desire and self-control being at war with eaoh other, each wins mastery for a while in turns, till self-control, through repeated and unwearying exercise, wins and the phallus finds a stabilization in the horizontality. When, however, the mastery is overthrown by further accesses of desire and by a flaming up of passion, the phallus starts moving further upward, - at least figuratively, - along the higher quadrant and achieves the apogee, but, self-control, continuing to dog desire and achieving a second term of mastery, brings the phallus to a halt, though only at the apogee. Stabilization at the upper terminus of each of the two quadrants is only an unsteady stalemate. Virtue has to account it a victory for itself that it has got Vioe by the throat, while Vice has to find comfort in that its hand is relentlessly pressing Virtue at the Adam's Apple. Even this much is no mean victory for Virtue, for the impulses in man to Virtue, always weak and intermittent, are disciplined in the battle to a steadiness and a strength which, in due course, become adequate to the overmastering and the overthrowing of powerful and incessantly and insidiously active Vice.</page><page sequence="49">Har appan : Vedici Proto- Historie 337 The stabilization at the apogee does not, however, last for long, for desire has unparalleled and insidious persistence and resistless force, and it seeks to burst all controls. Should desire by its pertinacity wear out self-control, it attains satisfaction by a spilling of seed, through sex-congress or otherwise, and, thereupon, the phallus falls from zenith to nadir, and stays there inert till the setting in of a reawakening of desire. Should, how- ever, the discipline of self-control win in the struggle at the points of stabilization, desire gets no chance of obtaining satisfac- tion through avoiding of seed: the steady and unfaltering discouragement of desire which follows on the determined exercise of self-control brings about a gradual abatement of desire, and the phallus, freed from impulsions to the seeking of satisfaction through tumescence and turgidity, starts on a downward journey along the two quadrants. With persistence in the discipline of self-control, desire keeps ebbing away till it disappears and the emotions attain an unruffled placidity, and, as a result, the phallus returns to the nadir. When the seeds of desire perish so thoroughly that they cannot sprout again, the phallus, too, settles down to a flaccidity so completa that not even violent resurgences of desire can work a revitalization. Neither the stations attained by the phallus nor the condition of the phallus when occupying those stations is, thus, any indica- tion of the emotion prevailing at the time. The flaccidity of the phallus may not only betoken a desire that has sated itself, but also a desire that, through a sustained disdain of the seeking of satis- faction, has so completely overcome potency as to be dead to even desire's stirrings : it may even be a desire that has not begun to know itself. A phallus risen rigid may equally signify a desire that aggressively seeks satisfaction or a powerful desire that stands countered by the greater power of an unwearying and masterful self-control. The ethic behind phallis appearances is expressed in terms of other conditions too of the āex-organs. A normal prepuce is ordinarily adequate to its natural func- tion of sheath to the glans penis, but, when desire grows strong, the phallus, in its tumescence, grows great in size, and the glans 43 [ Aaail s, B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="50">338 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute penis emerges all too operly, discarding the cover of the foreskin which, becoming all too sparse, gets lost in a virtual effacement on the surfaC3 of th.3 phallus, and this effacement persists so long as the stalemate between hanger and discipline endures. If the ardour of desire, instead of standing arrested by that self-control, finds vent in satisfaction of some kind the glans retires gladly into the prepuce: if, also, discipline wins its difficult . victory the phallus softens, losing its unruiiness, the glans retires abashed and the foreskin advances and regains lost, if shrunken, territory and wraps the glans in a veil of decency. So, an emergent glans and a retracted prepuce are as consistent with ardours under check ás with hot desires, and so too is a flaccid phallus with a veiling prepuce consistent equally with an experienced craving, a satis- fied hunger and an extinguished appetite. It may sometimes happen that the prepuce, overgrown through a prodigality of nature, passes beyond the glans and narrows into the close constrictions imposed by an elasticity of the foreskin. This operates as bar, during even the term of tumescence, to the effecting of sex-congress and to the emission of fecundating seed. And, yet, on6 who suffers from the affliction of such a prepuce may, instead of seeking the remedy of circumcision to secure indul- gence in desire, accept it for a blessing and subject himself to a voluntary abstention from desire, treating the nature-imposed restriction as a warning against even the onset of desire. An overgrown prepuce may, thus, be as consistent with mastered desire as with a desire that would fain be active and seek release from constraint. When the phallus grows in size under the influence of strong desire the glans inevitably becomes big and, emerging from the obscurity imposed on it by the prepuce, glows with an animation and a lustre produced by the enlargement of blood vessels teemicg with hot blood. This glow and lustre, brought about though they be by an onrush of desire, may yet be fully consistent with an arrest of that desire, so l:&gt;ug as the phallus does not subside into the limpness of satisfied, or exterminated, desire. The normal course of desire boing the course of seminal seed, there is a possibility of staying the flow of the seed, corresponding</page><page sequence="51">Hatappanx Vedici Proio-ììistÒric • }Ì9 to the possibility of stopping desire in its career. So, the unvoiding of; seed may be as consistent with arrest of desire as with desire in mid career. Ithyphallicism and the other phenomena we have adverted to in relation to the phallus turn out, thus, to be signs not only of libidiousness, fertilization and fecundity but also of the highest self-control and of the noblest continence. They are marks, ab the same time, of desire and of mastery over desire. Representa- tions of sex organs may not, therefore, be satisfactorily interpreted unless note ig taken of this double possibility. Anthropologist and Pornologist cannot taunt the Moralist out of Renunciation 8. THE STATUETTES AND INDRA AND SiPIVISTA-VISNU • • ♦ ♦ In a Rg-Veda hymn, which has been much wrangled over, we have two verges1 on the purport of which, however, there has been no disagreement. In the fir«t of the two verses, Indra is made to listen ti a sentiment bluntly expressed, both negatively and affirmatively : Nor potent nor prosperous is he whose organ dangles limp between his thighs : he alone is powerful whose organ grows in size as he sits down. This is clearly an expression of the view which the man of desires takes. To this Indra replies in the second verse, both negatively and affirmatively ♦* Nor potent ( nor prosperous ) is he whose organ grows in size as he sits down : he alone is truly potent whose organ hangs limp between his thighs.2 The letoit is terse. It implies that power and welfare could arise from, and even be founded on, impotency. In yet another verse of the Rg-Veda , Indra is giver of great strength and yet is Self-Castrate ( or, the Self-Mutilate ) hę is, at the same time, said to have got caught by the testicles by Kutsa and he is exhorted to free himself. The Indra who is self-castrate and yet has allowed his testicles to get into evil grasp is: none the less, .the giver of great strength. This is, 1 RV. 10. 86. 16, 17. 2 BY. 10. 38. 5. 3 RV. 6. 46. 3.</page><page sequence="52">34o Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute indeed, an enigma. The leaving of the testicles in Kutsa's grasp in an endeavour to escape would be a deprivation by Kutsa and not a self-deprivation by Indra, from whatever cause. The self-mutilation, being linked in the verse with power to confer strength, must itself be an act of strength of purpose, for only by the enactment of an act of self-deprivation, impelled thereto by determination, could strength, or power, be acquired to confer strength. This deprivation, whether it be by self-castration or by the discarding of the membrum virile, or by a combination of both expedients, is the clearest affirmation of the eagerness for the extirpation of desire. This is quite in accord with Indra's friendship for the Muni, - Contemner of Desires, - celebrated in a few hymns of the Rg-Veda? An acceptance of the Muni's means of spiritual achievement, - a sublimation of sex-hunger, as symbolical of every variety of desire, - that brings about an eradication of desire8 and develops such special powers as ability to travel in the wind, as the Muni does,3 cannot be more appropriately given effect to than by a contemptuous discarding, - a viòlent wrench- ing off, - of the organ which is typical of desire. Indeed, Indra is more than the Muni's friend : practising arduous penances he is the devoted practitioner of self-denial.4 A figure sans phallus expresses the self-denial better than one that has lost the testicles. So, the Harappan sculptor, carving Indra as Self-Denier, could present hitn either without the phallus or without the phallus and the testicles, departing from the letter of the Rg-Veda which required the excision of the testicles. Perhaps, he did fashion the figure ( PI, 2, 1 ) providing it with the penis and, then, deliberately knocked that organ out so as to impart Tealism to the representation of the result of the self-denial. Two further probabilities are presented by the statuette with the socket in the pubic region ( PI. 2, r. ). The first probability arises from the socket being larger, as has been already noticed, 1 RV. 8. 17. 14. etc. » BU. 4. 4. 22.

The sculptor of the figurine must have carved the phallus to a size so much bigger than the normal that there was no room in the stump to carve the scrotum too. He could not have lacked inspiration from the poetry of the Rg-Veda for providing the figurine with an abnormal appendage, for a poet permits himself suca an exaggeration when he endows Asaiiga Playogi, king, and perhaps Yogi too, with an organ pendulous and yet so big as to look a boneless thigh.1 The other probability, justified by the effeminacy of the build of the statuette and of the sparseness of the breasts, is that the stump might have had the marks of a woman's pudenda carved on the side visible to the on-looker, thereby transforming the statuette into a representation of a maiden who had just attainad nubility. For this fantasy too the sculptor could have been indebted to the Bg-Ved^ in a hymn of which occurs an allusion to an episode in Indra's career in which we find him impersonating a woman.8 Thus, the two statuettes ( Pi. 2. 1, r. ) might well be representa- tions of Indra, - both of them figuring an Indra who had killed desire and one of them representing an Indra who, for a brisf while, had taken on the form of a woman too. A parallel conundrum in terms of ithyphallicism and allied phenomena seeks to establish the greatness of Visņu, another important deity of the Rg-Veda . Visņu is said to have also a second name, Šipivista, the significance of which has to be spelt out of two verses in a hymn of the l}g-Veda :3 I, a devoted worshipper, who know the sacred rites, today celebrate this your sacred name, Sipivista : I, who am weak, laud you who are strong and dwell beyond this lower world.

The greatest of the scholiasts of Vedic literature, Yaska, - perhaps also one of the earliest of the post-Brāhmaņa age, being assignable, at the latest to about the 6th csntury B. C. , - inferred two significations.1 The one, which Visņu would not declare openly and is not to be declared, arises from Visņu being 'enveloped like a private member, that is, with rays obscured'. The other, apt for publication as being laudatory, arises from Visņu being 'one whose rays are displayed'. It is not a little important to note that the obscuration of the rays is presented as equivalent to the enveloping of the private member. The limited physiological reference must not, therefore, be departed from, whether we seek to explain the obscuration of the rays or the related phenomenon of their emanation. The obscuration and, therefore, the corresponding display must be only of Visņu's private member, and not of the whole of his form. Indeed, the epiphany of the complete form is mentioned almost by way of contrast, in the second of the verses. It is from the restriction that the praise and the reproof flow, Though the display and the obscuration of the rays are contrasts adequate to explain how Visņu could have a name of two contrary imports, there is nothing in them, prima facie, to account for the curious spectacle of Visņu declaring the name and taking pride in it and, at the same tim6, endeavouring not to tell it lest it come up for reproach. Contrasted conditions of the private member, - the being enveloped and, the counterpart to it, the being exposed, - must be the conditions which secure to him the exaltation and the abasement. The envelopment of the member should spell the abasement, and the exposure should spell the exaltation. And, Visņu is strong, great, divine. Here is an unexpressed, but inevitable, allusion to the movement of the glans penis forward in the prepuce when growing tumescent, and backward when falling flaccid. The ithyphallicism that is a sequel to a desire that stands checkmated brings the laudation. The deprecation is a sequel to the flaccidity i See Note 1 at end of this Section.</page><page sequence="55">2 Jarappan : Vedic : Proto- Historic 343 of the member, but that flaccidité might be due as much to a desire that has been sated as to one that has been deliberately extinguished. To impute the flaccidity to sated desire would be to deny to Visņu the character attested to by the ithyphallicism of check-mated desire. So, the flaccidity must be taken to be the mark in Visņu of a cultivated impotence, and thé abasement he feels must be traced to the lustful and uninstructed among men mistaking the limpness for the sign of a natural impotency and making &amp; taunt of it. The contrasts turnout, thus, to be illusory: Visņu is great because of his being exemplar of the extinction of desire, whether the phallus be tumescent or flaccid. Having, thus, understood how the poet's mind has worked in these verses, we are able to see a new significance in the other contrast we have seen him institute, between the radiation of rays from the private member and their obscuration. Apparently, the poet's reference is to notions that the gl ans has a sheen during the term of the retraction of the prepuce when passion is under control, that, then, a beam of light issues from it or that a halo surrounds it and that that lustre gets ob.» cu red by the prepuce when there comeā a limpness as a sequel to a purposeful extinc- tion of desire. Here too we have an affirmation of the high ethic. That this is just the interpretation of the verses that was in the poeťs mind is borne out by his assertion, in the verses, that the name had nothing of the deprecatory in it, that lie who knew the sacred rites celebrated Visņu by that name which was a sign of strength ( contrasted with the poeťs own weakness), that the name signified the presence in Visņu of qualities that placed him beyond this base world and that the form of the god which the name pointed to was one that was eminently fit to be revealed. Were further confirmation of this interpretation needed it will be found in the meanings imputed 1 3 tne name by those who were prone to look for what is out of the way in what is normal, and for what is base in what is noble. The name was interpreted by them to signify 'leprous person', the effacement of the foreskin on the augmented surface of the tumescent phallus being evident-</page><page sequence="56">344 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute ] y traced to the working of a leprous affliction.1 The significance 'bald man ? was seen in the word by those who were on the look out for what is out of the way. Baldness is an absence of hair where it generally grows : hair is frequently compared to rays of light : baldness is therefore equivalent to the absence of light rays : the glans covered by the prepuce does not emit light rays • Visņu's phallus emits no lustre, it being covered by the prepuce as he has conquered desire completely; so, he is bald : thus runs one line of interpretation. Another runs diffe- rently : the glans is covered by a prepuce much overgrown : this excess is accepted cheerfully, for Visnu seeks no mode of satis- fying desire : because of bhe overgrowth the glans emits no light *• so Visņu is bald. So also is it that, in the later Vedic literature, Varuņa, with his special association with Righteousness, is depicted as bald,2 and that, in the Makā- Bhārata, Visņu in his role as Krsņa says that he is bald.3 Yet further confirmation is not wanting. An overgrowth of the prepuce is accepted in Buddhism as perhaps the most signi- ficant of the marks of the Great Person who was was the ideal of Buddhism, a creed that, notwithstanding the unconformity which, in later times, was sought to be emphasized in it, did not jettison its heritage of faith in the supreme efficacy of the renunciation of desire. Of the Buddha himself the edifying tale is told : ' And he so arranged matters by his wondrous gift that Ambattha the Brāhmaņa saw how that part of the Blessed One that ought to be hidden by clothes was enclosed in a sheath '4 The Buddha affirmed thus that, because of renunciation, he was indeed a Great Person. None the less, it is not to be ignored that this identification with Visņu must find reason for the effeminacy of the statuette and for its bearing indications in the neck which show that it could also be polycepbalic at will.5 The Rg-Veda speaking only of Visņu taking a strange form in battle,6 tbe relevancy is one limited to 1 Sipivistas tu khalatau dusoarmaņi mahesvare : Amarakosa. a For instance, SB. 13. 3. 6. 5. 9 MBê, 12. 343. 41. 4 Digha-Nikaya : 3 Ambattha Sutta , 2ě 11-2.

UPWARD SEED AND DYING TO DESIRE The ethic of the effacement of desire for the blandishments and the enjoyments of sex, merely glanced at in the Rg-Veda in the references we have noticed to phallicism and Indra and Visņu, is no more than a fraction of the larger,- the all inclusive and comprehensive, - ethic of the abnegation of desire of every kind which is the technique of high life in the Rg-Veda. The ßg- Vedic man of religion is trained to make offerings in sacrifice. His conviction is that he is making offerings, not to propitiate evil or malicious powers, but to deities who, to him, are not only gods in general but are also companions on earth, helpmates in life, ferrymen across the empyrean, and comrades in heaven. The significant offerings are principally in fire in affirmation of thè utter sincerity of the devotion and the prayers. The sacrifice to which the hymns of the Rg-Veda are accompaniment is, in essence, an irretrievable and irrevocable offering up of possessions in ravenous fire,- everything that could be desired or possessed being turned theieby into an offering of which fire allows nothing to survive. Every man burns up his possessions and, śo, his desires, to bitter ashes, not only periodically but day in and day out, and deliberately and devoutly. 1 Majjhima Nikaya : 91 ( Brahmayu Sutta ) ; 16., 92 Śela Suttua. 8 Dïgha-Nikaya : 30 3. ô butta-Nipata : 5 Par ay ana I 1.44, 7.</page><page sequence="59">Harappan : V edic : Proto- Historic 347 If the Vedio sacrificer solicits an increase of wealth it is that he may have more and more of which he may denude himself. 4 The desire of riches incites us to holiness says one offerer : 1 and for that holiness he offers the riches to the gods. When another offerer prays, ' May Dravinodas give us riches that may be heard of ' he declares : 4 We ask them for the gods ?.2 Yet another affirms, ' riches are for the sacrificing to the gods'.3 This was expressed differently by an offerer of perhaps later times *• 4 Atman, at beginning of things, wished, Would that I had Wealth : then I would offer sacrifices '4 If the sacrificer asks for long life and for progeny it is not for the happiness of life in a family, but for Renunciation being kept on, both for the full span of his life and for generations in bis line, and however rich the family might grow : * Grant, Agni the means of many ( pious rites ) such that it might be perpetual '• may there be sons and grandsons to us in our race '.5 Sacrificers, having sons and grandsons, repeat the hymns of the sacrifice ; 6 the sons will be celebrators of the sacred rites7 beyond the lives of the fathers and down into the lives of the children. Wealth sacrificed opens the door to heaven : 4 He ( Agni ), the great one, knows indeed the place of wealth, the ascent to heaven'.8 The Rg-Vedic seers sang tirelessly of the greatness of Agni (Fire) as the indefatigable Consumer of offerings and as the Conveyer to the gods of what is offered, of the virtue of the fire- offering, of the offering in fire being the occasion of a communion of the offerer and the gods on earth, and of the offerers going to the world of the gods through their offerings and of living there with the gods in communion. To see Magic in this is to be purblind both to Msgic and to Religion. To see greed in the requests of the priests for large fees for their participation in the sacrifices is wholly to ignore the significant facts of their code of life.

Distributing the cattle among themselves so that no one may have more than two or three heads of the cattle, they offer up all tie products from the cattle in fire, thrice a day, by way of ridding themselves of love of possessions and of stabilising and confirming themselves in a life of utter desirelessness.1 The Rg-Veda and the culture which it bequeathed had for purpose, plan and programme a thorough discouragment, and a complete eradication, of unspiritual desire in every one of its protean forms. This fundamental principle is to be deduced from other references too in the Rg- Veda. Desire raises a warmth, a heat, a fervour, both in the mind and in the flesh. Strong desire is a fire that steadily and undemonstratively burns up the human frame and warps the emotions when it does not find satisfaction, and, when it does sate itself, consumes the object of desire and reduces it to cinder. The Aůgirases, free from desire,2 instituted worship. Desire itself has to be cast as offering in fire ' that fire in turn becomes an offering and feeds a more potent fire which, flaming up furiously, consumes ferociously and leaves not even ashes behind. The upward-rising flame that consumes belongings and the upward-risen phallus that keeps seed unvoided are symbols of Desire Extinguished. * Agni is capable (of protecting men) : he is himgelf the oblation and the sacrifice '.s Desire, discarded as offering, gets etherealised and goes up along with Agni ( Fire ), which flames upward,4 having an upward course,5 along with the offerings,6 erect like a line,7 which way they are directed8 at the sacrifices, just as the brightly adored prayer goes upward9 the sacrificial ladles rising high to pour the liquid offerings into fire,10 and the tubs holding the soma offering soaring upwards to the gods.11 Skyward rises Agnťs red smoke.12 Heavenward is the 1 Aravamufchan, in Triveni , ( 1956 gl. ) 134-5. * RV. 1, 71. 3.

He is Golden Seed ( Hiranya-Retas ). He is latent in the fire- sticks and he requires to be roused and raised by an arduous churning of the flame-generating stick : then, the flame rises upward and burns up the tares and the thistles. So does the seed of Celibates, - killers of even desire in general, though they may be specified only as killers of sex- desire, - rise as Upward-Seed (Urdhva-Retas). If the Celibates prevent the further journey of the seed it stands checked at the crown of the head where it gathers and, forcing up the scalp, pro- duces a protuberance, the Usņlsa, right over the crown.

These are exercises in the disciplining of every sense, thought and feeling (Yoga), desigaed to lead primarily to the achievement of the arrest of desire, symbolized in Upward Ssed, as indicative of Upward Phallus, and thence to the attainment of the highest spiritual status by the discarding of possessions and the accompanying desires irrevocably and irretrievably as offerings in Fire ( Yaga ). This is a turning away from the flesh, - not from the creature necessities of our being which are imbed- ded in the flesh, but from those blandishments of the flesh which, by their fascination and vitality, tend to exalt the flesh and over- whelm the spirit. Renunciation of unspiritual desires in various gradations, of which asceticism may be the easiest, is the basic feature of the code of life devised by ßg-Vedic times as the instrument of the good life, for Man and Society. A. dying to self, as it is sometimes phrased, is a living in the non-self, - and, so, in the infinite. The individual desires that bar the approaches to the individual's spiritual life and to the welfare of society being extinguished, or at least kept within limits, man becomes qualified for the life social and for the life spiritual. Indee ' so clear were the TJg- Vedic thinkers that the good life of society is the inevitable and unfailing sequel to the good life of the individual that, stressing the life spiritual for the individual they passed over social life in silence. A sound social life is the very foundation of .IJg-Veiic spiritual life. And, foundations are not on exhibition. Nothing emerges more clearly from all this than that whatso- ever the tactic devised iń the struggle between flesh and spirit, ™ be it Vrata, Mauna, Brahmacarya, Tapa?, Samnyäsa, Yoga or Yaga,,- the underlying strategy is unvaryingly that of Renuucia- tion öf unspiritual desires ( Tyâga, Nyãsa ). Every one of the tactics springs from the primal strategy. The basic strategy and the several tactics are but efforts of the same culture to seek a</page><page sequence="63">Harappan*. Vedic : Proto- Historic 351 way from the conflicts of life to social welfare and spiritual advance. And, yet;, there are endless attempts to place Yoga and Yäga in different cultures. It should now be easy to see that what may compendiously be called the cult of Urdhva-Retas, with sequels in Yoga and allied disciplines, which is attested to by the two Harappan statuettes ( PI. 2, 1. and r, ) is just what is eloquently spoken to by the seal of Paśupati-Rudra (Pi, 1, top) which now stands accepted as the find that fixes the character of Harappan culture. The pose of Paśu- pati-Rudra in the seal and the disposition of his limbs mark him a superb Yogi and there is an unmistakable suggestion of an Urdhva-Medhra in the figure. The pair of deer carved in the pedestal of the figure are also proof of the association of the figure with initiation, pupilage, the celibacy which is essential for pupilage, and the performance of sacrifice ( Yäga )} There can now be no gainsaying the fully Vedic character of the seal and the significance of the two statuettes. ri he very feature that serves as the l asis of the view that the Pašupsti-Siva figuie is non-Vedic, - the Ycga pose, - is among the factors that establish it to be typically Vedic, Yoga being but one of the rnnny tech- niques of Vedic Nyasa. And, yet further evidence piles itself up as we proceed. 10.

As, in the process, the Paśupati-Rudra of the Rg-Veda , who is none other than the Siva of later Vedic literature, had to be voted a 'Dravidian' god, the vote was cast instantly, notwithstanding that the reasoning, including the etymological, was quite subjective. These scientists would study the patterns of pots and pans and the patterns of the paintings on them but they will not seek to understand what idea the potter had put in the form or the painter had put in the paint- ings lest they commit the sin of subjective thinking. Even striking similarities in patterns on such objects are to go ignored unless they fit into the theory that has commended itself to the archaeo- grapher. How little of science there is in the method will be obvious from what follows. A. scene depicted on a few Harappan pieces (Fig. 46) 1 is highly intriguing, no parallel occurring in any other culture. A Cro- codile, or similar Reptile, is the character in the pride of place, five animals and two men being distributed on either side of it in a rough symmetry. On either side of Reptile's head stands a Bull, or Horse, each butting at the other : from beyond reach of Reptile's legs Rhinoceros on one sid8 glares at Man on the other, though one of the arms of Ma%n is just grazed by a vicious paw of Reptile** to one side of Reptile's tail stan Is Elephant looking at Tiger on the other, which returns look for look, turning its head back for the purpose. In the flatness of the re- presentation, which avoids the three-dimensional effect, Elephant's trunk and Tiger's tail appear to merge in the tail of Reptile. A second Man, a tiny one, grasps Reptile's tail with one hand and a front leg of Elephant with the other. That the pattern of this scene is quite similar to that on the Paśupati-Rudra seal ( PI. 1, top ) cannot be gainsaid. Of the animals of the periphery, i The finds are from various areas asd strata : Mackay, FEMD. 358 : 69 ( 23 ) ; 357 : 91 ( 13 ), same as - : 92 ( 2a ); 358 : 91 ( 19a ), same as-; 92 ( 10 ); 363 : 103 ( 16 ). Four, in all, apparently.</page><page sequence="65">Barappati: Vedici Proto- Historic 353 Elephant, Rhinoceros and Tigar are common to both : the animals are ranged similarly about a central figure, Cr:codile : in this scene Crocodile does duty for Yogi-Tri-Face in the other : the two curves of the head-gaar of Yogi-Tri-Face seam to be paral- leled in the two curves that crown Reptile. The parallelism points to Reptil and Paáupati-Rudra being at least counterparts to each other. There are differences and it is these that must guide us to an understanding of the parallelism of these characters. The Buffalo of the Paśupati- Rudra composition is replaced by a pair of butting animals in the plaque and the two combatants would be equine but for the pair of curves that look horns, but, being only two, cannot grace the heads of two animals. The snout of Reptile touches the heads of the butting animals, in the flatness of the representation, and appears to enter the two heads and get crowned by the two curves, posing the problem whether the curves are the horns of either of the two animals or are the pincers-like prehensiles of a reptile which is more of Scorpion than of Porpoise or Crocodile. In any event, the curves affirm Crocodile to be counterpart to Yogi-Tri-Face. One common lina serves for the tail of Reptile, the trunk of Elephant and the tail of Tiger. A paw of Reptile touches a hand of one of the Men and the other Man keeps pulling Elephant's leg and trunk-tail together. Rhinoceros alone stands apart from, and unconnected with, Reptile. Here is apparently an effort to link Reptile up with virtually all the beasts and the men in the composi- tion, - the linkage being by an entry into them all by Reptile. No such linking is attempted in the Paśnpati-Rudra seal. Of a deity who could effect such a pervasion as we find in this plaque we have no knowledge, in any culture, equally ancient, to the west of the Panjab and Sindh. We shall be finding later on that the gods of ancient Egypt were capable of pervading all objects. But Sebek, the god associated with the Crocodile, - as Crocodile's torso, - being, from an early date, the personifica- tion of evil and death,1 cannot be equated with the Harappan Reptile, which represents a god. Efcymologlcally, the name of the 1 S. A. B. Mercer, Religion of Ancient Egypt ( 1949 ) 129, 155, 239-40. 45 [ Annals, B. O. R.

Hie other name, Sipi-vista, also signifies Pervader of Creatures. It is Visņu that with his thr^e great 4 stoppings forth ' famous in the Rg-Veda , pervades the universe. So, Reptile of Harappan who enters crea- tures may well be a representation of Visņu. The Rg-Veda knows of the Simsumāra, 'Porpoise,1 but not of the Simsumāra as a representation of Visņu.2 But, in later Vedic literature, the lord of all living beings, who also surrounds them for their protection, is a mighty, divine personage, Simsumāra, - figured as a Porpoise, - in whom are figuratively located, in various parts of his form, the gods, the sacrifices, and Righteousness and other personages and principles and powers.2 The Visņu Purãna% one of the most authoritative of the Purāņas, says that Visņu stretches forth, diffused, in the celestial sphere, in the form of a Porpoise, that his special station is the Porpoise's heart and that the Porpoise, with the Pole Star in its tail, encircles the celestial sphere, embracing the innumerable constellations in its pervasive spread.4 The entering into plants appears to be suggested by a damaged stroke or two just visible in the right- bottom corner of the Harappan plaque. The pervading of plants, beings, celestial bodies, the gods and even abstract principles, exemplified by what is said of Sipivista and Simsumāra is all too clearly the all-comprehensive pervasion which is the charac- teristic of Visņu.5 This discovery of Visņu in this culture is of the utmost importance to its identification.

We have, however, found Visņu in the culture, - and we shall be finding him, to be at least as prominent in Harappan as Siva. Ever since Anthropologists and others started finding white and brown in Hinduism as a culture they have left Visņu severely alone as too Vedic to be claimed for łDravidian' It may be that now that he has been found in Harappan and in company with Siva the destiny that has all along been his just due, for being blue-black in complexion, will still overtake him. But, it is some consolation that today he is still excluded from the browns, notwithstanding that brown is the lot allotted, scholarwise, to poor Rudra, albeit he has been traditionally and scripturally red, - and, even spotlessly white. That Siva and Visņu do occur in Harappan and in almost exactly parallel forms is not the only gain we have come by in this investigation. That the two gods occur together in the same milieu, just as they occur together in the Rg-Veda , and that they occur in Harappan with just the same characteristics which they ever since have had in Indian culture, down indeed to the present day, are of prime importance, not only as establishing the Vedicr character of Harappan culture but also as placing it beyond cavil that Paáupati-Rudra-Siva too is so patently a product of Rg- Vedic culture that other origins and affiliations are clearly excluded. Note i - Need we, however, be positive that the Šimsumárá, in its occurrence in the Ķg-Veday does not represent Visņu ? The verse recounts how when the Asvins went to Divodãsa with treasure their chariot was drawn by a Bull and a Porpoise, yoked 1 Aravamuthan, J BES.

The singularity of the yoking together of an upstanding animal and a crawling reptile, the latter of which could at any moment essay a bite at the legs of the former, and of the slow progress which alone such a chariot could have made in the journey, contrasted with the speed with which the Ašvins are wont to hasten toa call to them for aid, is a clue to us to look for a meaning beneath the surface. If the Bull could be one of the many gods so called in the Ķg-Veda and the Śimśumara could be Visņu, as in later devlopments, we shall have, in the verse, a picture of the Ašvins taking Visņu and another god with them to bestow riches on Divodāsa. Considering how much more intelligible the verse becomes on this surmise than if we stuck to the literal meaning and declined to make no more progress to an understanding of the text than what the Ašvins would have made had they yoked only such coursers to their chariot, the inference that the Śimśumara of this verse too is Visņu himself is by no means improper. It is a pity that we have no means of knowing who the other god was who, as Bull, stood yoked to the chariot, but this ignorance cannot affect the probability of the Porpoise having been Visņu. Note 2 - The Buddha too is occasionally a Pervader, - what made of him an avatāra of Visņu.

UTTÄNAPAD-V1RÄJ AND CREATION While we have found that Egypt's Earth-god fails as a parallel to the Harappan divinity of outstretched legs who goes through the pangs of the delivery of an uncommon offspring and suffers the fate of decapitation, ( Fig. 33ab ) we have hymns in the Rg-Veda that tell us of events in the mystery of Creation. Uttänapad, equal- ly ' Outstretched Legs ? and 4 The Recumbent ' gave birth to the Earth and the Regions : Daksa (Pure Act) and Aditi (the Infinite) were born from each other : from Daksa were born the Gods, the Bleat, the Kin of Immortality ♦ Purusa (Person ) and Virāj ( Universal Nature ) gave birth to each other : and, Purusa was offered up in a sacrifice made by the Gods, the Perfected and the Prophets.2 The scenes on the two faces of the Harappan seal are appropriate as depicting Uttānapad-Purusa being delivered of Virāj and, then, allowing himself to be mede a victim of to the sacrificial knife. It cannot also go unnoticed that Purusa could not have been offered up were it not that he is the priceless wealth of the Perfected, the Prophets and the Gods. All this is in the closest accord with the spirit of Vedic Renunciation, or Sacrifice. Where Ufctānapad lay recumbent, legs outstretched, is deducible from other hymns of the Rg-Veda. In the beginning, Dark-Inert being hid by Dark-Inert, all This was Fluid, indeterminate : the waters were fathomless abyss.3 The Maker of the Senses engen- dered Wat6r, and also Heaven and Earth floating on Waters.4 The Waters hold creative power and breed sacrifice.5 Verily, the Waters, first retained that Embryo, beyond gods, in which sll the gods, aggregated, single, contemplated each other, standing firm in the Flood, each enlinked with the other.6 The watery habitat of 1 lb ., Culla- Vagga, 5. 6. 1 « RV. 10.90. 8 BY. 10.129.1. 4 RV. 10.82.1. 5 RV. 10.121.8. 6 RV. 10.82.5-6.</page><page sequence="70">ļ$8 Annals of the Bhandar kar Oriental Research Instttuu Uttānapad has, thus, a counterpart in the marine abode of the Egyptian Earth-god, but the resemblance stops there. The Creation * Myth 9 of the Rg- Veda takes on many forms, each of which is as intriguing as it is interesting, as we shall be learning as we proceed further in this fctudy. One of the transformations of later times includes an equivalence of Virāj and Prajāpati ( Creator J,1 and oí Prajāpati turning into a Tortoise to produce all creatures.2 But, the Tortoise is also Sacrifice.3 It is sprung from the juice of the Earth4 * This tortoise is the life- sap of these worlds ' and Prajāpati generated this Earth from the Waters5 and ' all this (univerße) appeared as one form only, water'.6 Prajāpati, as Tortoise, moves in the primeval waters ( of chaos ) '7 The Uttānapad of the Harappan seal who brings a tortoise to birth is the parent, thus, of the Prajāpati of later Vedic literature.8 So, in the Harappan seal, Uttānapad-Purusa lies extended, while Virāj-Prajāpati has just issued from the womb, so that, in due course, Virāj-Prajāpati may give birth to Uttānapad-Purusa. The extended arms of the Uttānapad of the Harappan seal are as important, for this identification, as the extonded legs. The arms are stretched, forth and out, so as almost to rest on the knees of outstretched legs, just as in the Paśupati-Rudra seal ( PI. 1, 1 ), in a pose that is typically Yogic.9 Uttānapad may not be explicit as Yogi in the Ęg-Veda&gt; but he is one in later developments.10 Uttānapad and Virāj are progenitors of each other. A progenitor may be father, or mother, - male or female. So, Uttānapad and Virāj may each be a mala or a female. This possibility has been exploited to the full in Vedic thought. Uttānapad, when thought of as a female,11 is the progenetrix of the Creator, Prajāpati, or of a Creatrix, Vāc (Speech), whom we shall have to get better acquainted with in due course.

This intriguing figure is, in fact, a figure within a figure, the larger, the Recumbent One, enclosing the smaller, a Tortoise or a Turtle, between his wide- thiust legi, in partial reduplication of himself. Head answers to head, though each head lies at an opposite end : the two pairs of the flappers of the Turtle answer, in position, to the pair of legs and the pair of arms of Uttānapad, though the addenda of the Turtle point upward toward its head unlike the arms of Uttānapad which stretch toward his feet. The two are also connected by a ligature running between.

A juster appreciation gives us here a picture of a woman just delivered of a new-born babe, which naturally lies between her legs, and the ligature is the umbilical cord neither thrown off from the mother nor severed yet from the babe. But, it is not enough, in seeking to understand these symbolic representations, to confine ourselves to appreciations which are just: we have to allow for fancies entering these compositions. Had the Harappan artist conjured up for himself the fancy of the mother bringing to birth a babe of the gigantic propor- tions which myth or whim generates, the smaller figure of the Harappan composition would have been thought of by him as mother to the larger. Such is the nucleus from which grows the ītg-Vedic idea of Uttānapad giving birth to Virāj and, in the reduplication, of Virāj bringing forth Uttānapad. In the latter case, the ligature is the umbilical cord issuing from Virâj's womb and running to Uttānapad's navel* Here, therefore, is a fancy of one umbilical cord running between two personages each of whom is a mother when the other is a babe, and carrying a two-way traffic of the nourishment which, in the womb, passes from mother to foetus. The Rg-Vedic poets explore all the possibSities of the situation and we find the Harappan artist reproducing the poeťs fancy, faithfully picturing the marvel of Creation and the ramifications of that marvel, limited only by the ability of plastic art to reproduce poetic, or symbolic, fancies. The authors of the Rg-Vedic symbolism of Creation were an- xious that it should bear its elucidation in itself. In the apprehen- sion that it might not be understood if it were patterned on child- birth in human-kind, wherein the principal phenomena enact themselves in the privacy and obscurity of the mother's body till the emergence of the babe into the opan, the pattern of calving among animals was preferred, for, among beasts, much of the process of birth oocurs in the open, outside the body of the mother animal. Exceptional instances of a human mother delivering in the manner of an animal one being not unknown,-- it being known as a birth 46 [ Annals, B. R. I. 0. ]</page><page sequence="74">362 Annals of the Bbandarkar Oriental Research Institute in caul, - the pattern of the birth in caul it isthat was adopted for the symbolism. The babe, lying curled up, in the maternal womb, with its toes so near the mouth that it appears to suck the toes, is a large egg in form : it floats in the waters imprisoned in the caul : these waters are golden in colour. The babe with toe in mouth becomes the forerunner of the Serpent with the tail in its mouth. By figurative transference of the golden colour from the waters to the babe, we have the Golden Embryo, Hiranya-Garbha,1 emphasised bý the other picture of the Golden Sun rising from the waters of the ocean at dawn : the waters in the caul enveloping the babe copiously are, to it, a veritable Ocean. Waters on earth, flowing away shapelessly when undefined by confinement in a container, and, even so, taking every one of the forms which the container may be of, and waters in the atmosphere, being equally formless as vapour, - even clouds being amorphous and chang- ing form ceaselessly, - make the perfect symbol of Chaos. The babe itself is indeterminate, growing from shape to shape in the period of gestatioh, in an attempt to escape the Chaos which it started as. On the waters in the caul the babe, yet uninformed by the advent of independent life, lies inert in the darkness of what is the Océan of Chaos. Partakirg, however, of the life of the mother, the babe keeps awake among the waterp, though its own senses have not come into independent action. The lower and the upper curves of the caul limiting the embryo's being and growth are the vault of its Heaven and the spread of its Earth : the waters above it form its watery Atmosphere. The caul within which the babe lies enclosed is at once what connects and separates it from the mother, and the umbilical cord running from the walls of the mother's womb to the babe's navel and serving as conduit from the mother along which the babe receives rich sustenance ( puskara ) so long as it stays in the womb, is the link between the life that is and sustains and the life that is yet to be. When, however, that moment arrives when the babe, outgrowing the indeterminatenees in itself and attaining maturity, receives the spark of individual life and the gift of individual Consciousness, the caul bursts, simultaneously releasing the golden waters: from Chaos issues the Create, I See Note 3 at tho end of this Seotion.</page><page sequence="75">Harappan : Vedic : Proto-Historic 363 which, thereupon, has all the appearance of a babe, curled up and sucking its toes, while lying on a spread leaf,-- the disrupted caul, - but fancy suggests also the alternative picture of a person seated on a lotus blossom peeping above the leaves of a lotus ( puskara ), with its long sfcalk, - the caul and the umbilical cord. The tubular stalk of the lotus drawing sustenance for the blossom from Mother Earth is the parallel to the umbilical cord which at the Navel ( Nābhi ) opens into the babe with its unfailing stream of nutrition. The babe, having received individual Consci- ousness along with individual life, is able, though only in infantile measure, to apprehend the phenomena of nature in its variety of forms, and to differentiate form from form, giving thereby to each Form ( Rūpa ) a definition, Name ( Nama ). Looked at from the adults point of view, - he taking for granted what does exist as having existed all along, - this is mere appreciation of Form and application of Name, but, viewed with the babe's eyes, it is the defining and the abstracting of nature's objects and ways from the Chaos in which they had their setting,- an evoking of the individuality of each of them and a coming into existence of what has not existed with that individuality, an unfold ing of Creation. The babe, endowed with Consciousness, is, thus, no less than a puissant Creator, dreaming the Create out of Chaos. He is Hiranya- Garbha, the Golden Embryo born as Creator Cbild, and he is Prajāpati, and he is Virâj. But, this Virāj, as child, having got Created, proceeds to create nature and nature's phenomena. But, in the realization that his own birth postulates a parent for him, he proceeds further and gives himself a parent who, thus, becomes his offspring. Thus do Uttānapad aud Virāj amuse themselves with the cosmic game in which they play parent and offspring to each other, but greatly to the mystificaon of the unitiatied onlooker.1 Note i - R. P.
