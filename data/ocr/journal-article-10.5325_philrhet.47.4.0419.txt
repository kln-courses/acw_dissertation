      <p>Every act of communication assumes a hermeneutic and a rhetoric, an implicit theory for interpreting public contexts of rhetor, discourse, and audience as well as a communicative practice that produces private/public effects through an audience responding to a rhetor's call.<sup>1</sup> The dominant model for such rhetorical hermeneutics represents an interpersonal communication between living human agents. In what follows, I explore an alternative to this model, one that embodies extrahuman, nonpersonal communication between the human and the divine.</p>
      <p>Humanist controversies of the last century provide a convenient starting place for this exploration. Various humanisms, antihumanisms, and posthumanisms assume some version of humanist rhetoric, either as an instrument to promote, a position to oppose, or a formation to transcend. How might we describe this humanist rhetoric? At a minimum, we can say that it involves troping, arguing, and narrating in a certain way that privileges human being and becoming. Rhetorical and other humanisms are ideologies that center on and think from the site of human being. Most humanist rhetorics assume a humanist ontotheology, which consists of speaking to and about God as a being, the Supreme Being, and then thinking being itself on the basis of this superior or perfect divinity.<sup>2</sup> That is, the humanist rhetoric of ontotheology conceptualizes all being, including that of the human, in terms of the Supreme Being and other subordinate entities.</p>
      <p>Another characteristic of this humanist ontotheology is that it traditionally thinks of divine superiority or perfection in anthropomorphic terms of personhood. Historically, “personhood” is the name of a relationship between beings that has certain ontological, ethical, political, legal, and ultimately rhetorical dimensions. Rhetorically, perhaps most important for defining personhood is a relation of mutual responsiveness: a person is a being who can respond to another being in such a way that the other being is affected by that response and recognizes the source of and possible motives for the cause of the effect. The condition of possibility for this responsiveness is that both beings at least partially identify with each other in sharing some significant characteristics (e.g., a shared interest in communicating even when their other interests are unsharable or even in conflict). Human beings are embodied persons with selves that have identities. All human beings are persons, but not all persons are human beings. An embodied human person has multiple selves, private and public roles, related in various ways, sometimes in concordance or direct conflict, sometimes entirely separate and simply sharing the same embodiment.<sup>3</sup> Humanist rhetoric traditionally describes and enables a contextualized exchange among persons, rhetoric here being understood as the use of language in a context with the aim of having effects.</p>
      <p>Humanist rhetoric, even when it is not talking about the divine, usually assumes a humanist ontotheology of personhood. One problem with such rhetoric is that it privileges personalized human-to-human interactions in ways that disable thinking about human-to-nonhuman encounters. Generally, such rhetoric requires an ontological hierarchy to ground its ontic favoring of the human. As Kenneth Burke puts it, the production of hierarchies is an inevitable function of symbol-using animals employing language in the “Human Barnyard” (1969, 23, 279). Historically, humanism has promoted various ranked classifications of beings, most often placing God at the pinnacle, “Man” in the middle, and animals, plants, and stones below.<sup>4</sup> Humanistic rhetorics then assumed and reinforced the centrality of human beings by anthropomorphically projecting a view of divinity as human perfection and defining the human in clear opposition to lesser beings in the classification system. This humanist rhetoric usually grants personhood only to humans and those beings above them in the hierarchy. At times, such a humanist rhetorical perspective becomes defined more narrowly still, basing itself on the model of one individual human person interacting in a face-to-face relation with another individual human person, one interiority communicating representations to another interiority.</p>
      <p>In contrast, we could think of persons along Heideggerian lines: a human person is an instance of Dasein, a being for whom its being is an issue for itself, a being who takes a stand on its own being, which is to be a self with an identity (or selves with identities).<sup>5</sup> We might say with some Heideggerians that a person is a being-in-the world, “comporting” toward other beings and able to “transpose” itself into others; that is, a person is a being who comports toward other beings by transposing into or “going along with” them.<sup>6</sup> Heidegger makes the point that human beings are always already transposed; they do not begin as isolated individuals but as beings who are with others. They “go along [<italic>Mitgang</italic>] with others in their access [<italic>Zugang</italic>] to things and in their dealings [<italic>Umgang</italic>] with those things.” This is a “fundamental feature” of a human being's “own immediate experience of existence” (Heidegger 1995, 205). Thus, being transposed into others, going along with them, is necessarily a matter of degree rather than an all or nothing contingent affair. Rhetoric involves motivating changes in the intensity and extension of this transposing; it is about revising or confirming an audience's disposedness of being-in-the-world in a particular way, as I explain below. Ontic conflicts in our attunement can only appear against the background of this shared being-with.<sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p>If we follow this Heideggerian path of thinking, can we say that a “nonpersonal agent” or an “extrahuman being” is one who does <italic>not</italic> relate to others by comporting toward them in such a way that enables self-transposition into them? If so, what kind of rhetorical relation is possible with such nonpersonal agents, such extrahuman nonpersons? Is any kind of rhetorical transaction even plausible? For example, if we define God in personal terms, it is clearly possible to conceive an exchange between the human and the divine, modeled on rhetorical exchanges among human persons, no matter how different the divine person(s) might be from the human. But what if we define the divine in nonpersonal, extrahuman terms? What are the possible rhetorical transactions between the human person and the extrapersonal divinity? Certainly some forms of human prayer remain possible—prayer spoken to remind oneself of certain obligations, prayer as a collective accomplishment uniting a congregation, and so on—but other forms of prayer—prayer as the request of one person to another hoping for and believing in a response from that other—do not seem possible.<sup>8</sup> Are there other rhetorical relations possible between persons and non- or extrapersons? Or does rhetoric depend upon human-person relations as a condition of possibility? When all is said and done, are we left only with humanist rhetoric, even when we are trying to move beyond the human?</p>
      <p>It is here that I have run into a wall blocking my rhetorical path of thought. Instead of trying to bust through that wall immediately, I want to pause and perhaps better prepare myself for passing around it by presenting a fuller interpretation of a Heideggerian rhetorical hermeneutics.</p>
      <p>I turn first to the famous paragraph in Heidegger's <italic>Being and Time</italic> from the section called “The Existential Constitution of the ‘There.’” Aristotle's <italic>Rhetoric</italic>, Heidegger writes,<disp-quote>
            <p>must be taken as the first systematic hermeneutic of the everydayness of Being with one another. Publicness [<italic>Öffentlichkeit</italic>], as the kind of Being which belongs to the “they” [<italic>des Man</italic>], not only has in general its own way of having a mood, but needs moods and “makes” them for itself. It is into such a mood and out of such a mood that the orator speaks. He must understand the possibilities of moods in order to rouse them and guide them aright. (1962, 178)</p>
         </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>For now I only want to focus on the last sentence: the rhetor “must understand the possibilities of moods in order to rouse them and guide them aright.” Moods are specific ontic instances of what Heidegger ontologically calls “Befindlichkeit,” variously translated as “state of mind,” “attunement,” or “disposedness.”<sup>9</sup> Disposedness is ontically most familiar as “our mood, our Being-attuned” (172). “A mood makes manifest ‘how one is, and how one is faring’” (173).</p>
      <p>The disposedness manifested in moods is unavoidable: “We are never free of moods.” In fact, “a mood assails us. It comes neither from ‘outside’ nor from ‘inside,’ but arises out of Being-in-the-world, as a way of such Being.” Mood “<italic>makes it possible first of all to direct oneself towards something</italic>” (175–76). Most important, moods as disposedness enable things to matter for Dasein. This mattering is “not just sensing something, or staring at it. It implies circumspective concern, and has the character of becoming affected in some way.” Dasein's “senses” belong ontologically to a being whose disposedness characterizes its being-in-the-world, and because that is so, those senses can be “touched” by something or “‘have a sense for’ [<italic>Sinn haben für</italic>] something in such a way that what touches them shows itself in an affect” (176–77). According to Heidegger, it is this affect that Aristotle names <italic>pathos</italic>.</p>
      <p>If we now return to Heidegger's claim that Aristotle's <italic>Rhetoric</italic> is “the first systematic hermeneutic of the everydayness of Being with one another,” we can say that Aristotle's <italic>Rhetoric</italic> provides an interpretation of the everydayness of being-with-one-another by describing everydayness as constituted through the <italic>pathos</italic> of the <italic>doxa</italic>, the disposedness of the average view held by the “they,” <italic>das Man</italic>. In his 1924 lecture course, <italic>Basic Concepts of Aristotelian Philosophy</italic>, Heidegger had explained how <italic>pathos</italic> is a becoming, a changing of one's self-composition, which moves the hearers from one <italic>hexis</italic>, habitual way of being and acting, to another.<sup>10</sup> An orator guides the <italic>pathos</italic> of the hearers, moving them to regain their composure in a new <italic>hexis</italic>. <italic>Pathos</italic> is an embodied disposition, both an interpretation and felt attitude, of being-in-the-world, which is the basis of speaking. We speak into and out of <italic>pathos</italic> as an everyday disposedness of being-in-the-world-with-one-another.</p>
      <p>In section 51 of <italic>Being and Time</italic>, Heidegger underlines the hermeneutic dimension of this rhetorical disposedness, noting the affective nature of understanding: “The foundation of any interpretation is an act of understanding, which is always accompanied by a [disposedness], or, in other words, which has a mood” (1962, 296). So the moods of one's disposedness accompany understanding, and since disposedness makes things matter in our being-in-the-world-with-others, such disposedness, mood, <italic>pathos</italic> is the concernful target of rhetoric.<sup>11</sup> Rhetoric works in this worldly context of what Heidegger calls “the publicness [<italic>Öffentlichkeit</italic>] with which we are with one another in our everyday manner” (296). In that publicness, in that everyday being with one another, we are beings-toward-death, but that's another story told elsewhere.<sup>12</sup> Mine is a rhetorical-hermeneutic tale of going along with extrahumans that supposedly live and move and have their being in the beyond.</p>
      <p>I suggest that this Heideggerian rhetorical hermeneutics provides another way of thinking about the relation between the human and the divine. For in such a framework, communication is not an information exchange between two interiorities; nor is it a persuasion directed by one rhetorical agent toward another; nor even is it an identification across thresholds of being. Instead, human-divine communication is a moving along with, a comporting toward, as one prayerfully asserts not in words that signify but, rather, through significations that accrue words or silences in an open disposedness of being-in-the-world-with-others.<sup>13</sup>
      </p>
      <p>And here I turn to some statements in Heidegger's 1929–30 lecture course, <italic>Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics</italic>, assertions made on the path to answering the question, “<italic>What is world?</italic>” There we find the controversial triple claim: the stone is worldless, the animal is poor in world, and man is world forming (1995, 176–77). If rhetoric can only take place within the human publicness of world, can there be a rhetoric effectively directed to nonhuman beings? And if, as Heidegger says, “the world is the totality of beings outside of and other than God” (176), then what hope can there be for a rhetoric directed toward the divine, toward the wholly other outside Dasein's world?</p>
      <p>Today, considering such a worldly hope, we might follow the paths of Jacques Derrida and before him Kenneth Burke and turn back again toward Augustinian negative theology.<sup>14</sup> Attending to Augustine's question in his <italic>Confessions</italic>—“Quid ergo amo, cum Deum meum amo?” (“What do I love when I love my God?”)—Derrida asks in his “Circumfession”:<disp-quote>
            <p>
               <italic>Can I do anything other than translate this question by S</italic>[aint] <italic>A</italic>[ugustine] <italic>into my language, into the same sentence, totally empty and huge at the same time, the change of meaning, or rather reference, defining the only difference of the</italic> “meum”<italic>: what do I love, whom do I love, that I love above all?</italic> (1993, 122)</p>
         </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Along this path of thought, we could explore what Derrida calls the “rhetoric of negative determination, endlessly multiplying the defenses and the apophatic warnings” of a negative theology. This kind of theology, Derrida notes, claims to escape parody and mechanical repetition “by means of the <italic>prayer</italic> that precedes apophatic utterances, and by the address to the other” (2008b, 144).</p>
      <p>John Caputo follows this path in <italic>The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida,</italic> echoing Augustine and Derrida in asking “what do I mean by the God whom I love? What do I love when I speak of loving God? What do I believe when I put my faith in God? To whom do I pray when I pray to my God?” (1997, 286–87). Concerning this last, Caputo remarks that for Derrida “‘God’ is the name of a question not an answer, of an errancy not a destination, … to whom one prays, with passion and tears, that one does not know to whom to pray, or who it is to whom one prays, or even who one is oneself.” However, Caputo explains further that the “lack of destination does not prevent the event of prayer but lets it break out; it does not stop the praying but provokes it all the more. One prays and prays, all the time hoping and praying that one's prayers are answered in and by the praying, confessing, addressing” (291). Caputo's Derridean answer to the question of prayer is, it seems, ultimately and not so simply the unanswered question of God. Accompanying this (non)answer is Caputo's rhetorical comment that “for Derrida, God is not an object but an <italic>addressee</italic>, not a matter for theological clarification but the other end of a prayer, given not to cognition but to passion, neither him nor her nor it, but ‘you’ (<italic>tu</italic>)” (289).</p>
      <p>But where does such prayer leave an extrahuman finite rhetoric understood as working with publics within Dasein's world, working on an audience's disposedness, its attunement, in such a way that there is a going along with the being of one another? Perhaps here is where we should turn to an alternative divinity who appears only briefly in the Heideggerian corpus. In conclusion, then, let me speak no more of God the Creator and take up instead a divine creature. This divine creature appears parenthetically in a famous 1929 debate between Heidegger and Ernst Cassirer in Davos, Switzerland. At one point in the discussion, the differences between the two philosophers hinged on the issue of the relation between the finite and the infinite. In defense of a neo–Kantian humanism, Cassirer argued for eternal and necessary truths against the claim that truths are always relative to Dasein. Heidegger responded by saying that “Cassirer wants to show that finitude becomes transcendent in [Kant's] ethical writings.—In the Categorical Imperative we have something which goes beyond the finite creature. But … this going-beyond to something higher is always just a going-beyond to the finite creature, to one which is created” and then in parenthesis the transcript adds “angel” (Heidegger 1997, 196). Commentators have rightly interpreted this parenthesis as highly ambiguous. How are we to take “angel” here?</p>
      <p>Given Heidegger's argument, we can at least understand angels as divine beings within rather than beyond Dasein's world. As Peter Gordon puts it, “Whatever the ambiguities of this [angelic] symbolism, it seems clear that Heidegger wished to say that for humanity our finitude stands as an impassable horizon, even and perhaps especially when we conceive of moral codes that appear to transcend our existence” (2010, 164).<sup>15</sup> If we also recall that within many faith traditions angels are viewed as divine messengers, beings that rhetorically relate one being to another, then in a rhetorical-hermeneutic frame they might appear as the interpretive connection among rhetorical beings, even as the very publicness connecting one with another in the everyday.<sup>16</sup>
      </p>
      <p>It is exactly this angelic publicness that Erik Peterson emphasizes in his essay “The Book on the Angels: Their Place and Meaning in the Liturgy.” A Heidegger contemporary and Roman Catholic convert, Peterson writes, “The angels demonstrate that the Church's worship is public worship offered to God” (2011, 141). The presence of angels guarantees that ecclesiastical rituals are public events not private practices. “As the emperor demonstrates the public character [<italic>Öffentlichkeit</italic>] of his political authority when he appears in the company of his bodyguard, so Christ [or the priest, Christ's representative] demonstrates the public character of his religio-political authority when he is accompanied by the bodyguard of the angels at holy Mass” (134).<sup>17</sup> But Peterson assigns another (complementary?) function to angels in his effort to establish that they “are more than a poetic ornamentation left over from the storehouse of popular fables.” Angels are “awakeners” (142) who “instruct” humans on the heights and depths of their existence. Angels “stand for a possibility of our being, a heightening and intensifying of our being” (139).<sup>18</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Fable or not, these evocations of angels in terms of publicness and intensification bring to mind another more recent interpretation of such divinities. From his perspective in science studies, Bruno Latour argues that religion is not about a distant supernatural realm based in a far-off, nonworldy future occupied by divine beings. Rather, religion is about making present what is already available in our human worldliness. This religious work of making present Latour describes as creating a “procession,” which he distinguishes from the scientific practices of developing networks of information. “That which layers and forms processions,” he writes, “I will call <italic>angel</italic> in contrast to that which aligns and maintains networks, which I call <italic>instrument</italic>” (2001, 225). Playing with the traditional notion of divine emissaries, Latour views angels as “bad messengers” who are unable to be simple instruments of information transfer. “The angels do not transport an undeformable message through space-time, they call out to people and keep saying: ‘Watch out! Take care! He's not here! That isn't the question! You're the one this is about! Someone is going to talk to you! Don't hang up!” (225). Angelic translations of messages do not transfer information; they <italic>transform</italic> hearers (Latour 2013b, 32–33).</p>
      <p>Latour's stark contrast between networks of referential information and processions of dynamic translations is invigoratingly useful but perhaps somewhat overstated.<sup>19</sup> On the one hand, the distinction works to demonstrate the divergent functions of utterances in different domains of culture (science and religion); on the other hand, there are obvious angelic examples in which the rhetorical force of a specific information transfer was the means through which a particular conversion took place. True and happily, angels are not mere instruments of information transfer but rather salvation bearers calling our attention to what we are missing in the here and now, drawing us together in renewed experiences of collective proximity as beings-in-the-world-with-others-and-with-ourselves (Latour 2013a, 303–8). But the rhetorical process of that salvation bearing, that calling to attention, is not merely phatic, not merely making the connection with no content to be hermeneutically experienced. Is it really the case, as Latour seems to claim, that the biblical angels bear no message to their hearers, no specific directions on how to pay attention or what deserves attention? In fact, their call about the call is not simply “don't hang up!” but also “listen to this” or “listen this way.” Thus, the angelic procession of translations involves a kind of hybrid speech, mostly phatic but with some information content, which complicates rather than simply illustrates Latour's distinction.</p>
      <p>This more hermeneutically full way of understanding angelic processions can take us back again to Heidegger, especially his ontological interpretation of conscience in <italic>Being and Time</italic>. “The call of conscience,” he writes, “has the character of an <italic>appeal</italic> to Dasein by calling it to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self… . The call comes <italic>from</italic> me and yet <italic>from beyond me and over me</italic>” (1962, 314, 320). In another place, Heidegger speaks of hearing as constituting “the primary and authentic way in which Dasein is open for its ownmost potentiality-for-Being—as in hearing the voice of the friend whom every Dasein carries with it” (1962, 206). Michael Hyde connects conscience directly to this “voice of the friend.” Though he does not compare the friend to a guardian angel, he does conclude that<disp-quote>
            <p>as beings whose existence is marked with an indelible communal character (publicness), we are bound to hear the call within the context of our everyday being-with-others. Our response to what the call has to say, show, and disclose must therefore contend with how our thinking and behavior are conditioned by this world of everydayness. (2001, 38)</p>
         </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>If we remember that St. Paul compares himself to an angelic messenger (Galatians 4:14), we might also use Heidegger's 1920–21 seminar on the Pauline letters to make a final turn in our rhetorical consideration of angels and prayer. Early Christian religiosity, Heidegger claims, resides in the enactment of a certain way of temporal being: a turning toward God and away from idols, a transformation of conduct enacted in serving God and waiting for his son's second coming (Heidegger 2004, 66–67). Like the angels, Paul says to the Thessalonians: “Let us keep awake” (5:6). But this is keeping awake in a particular manner, which Heidegger formally characterizes: “Christian religiosity lives temporality” (2004, 73). Heidegger explains that “the When is determined through the How of the self-comportment, which is determined through the enactment of factical life experience in each of its moments” (75). That is, this ongoing comportment of Christian religiosity gets enacted as a continuous waiting while serving God in the here and now. Heidegger does not speak of prayer at this point, but, as Benjamin Crowe argues, unceasing “watchful prayer” is an expression of this early Christian temporal form of life: “Praying in a spirit of ‘watchfulness’ means praying with one's eyes peeled and ears opened for the fulfillment of the new creation” (2005, 128). This is prayer as response to the angelic call.<sup>20</sup>
      </p>
      <p>From these various concluding angles on angels, we can view such beings less as otherworldy divinities to be believed in or not and more as mediators, catalysts, reminders for intensifying and heightening our own being-in-the-world. If God is an unanswered question continually reasked, is God also the name for this making present, not the origin of a message but the source of the angelic call? In any case, angels are those divinities that go along with us in our human actions, including our rhetorical activities. However we conceive prayerful rhetoric, angels define the publicness of that rhetoric, a worldly rhetoric that is neither solely humanistic nor entirely extrahuman. So conceived, does such rhetoric associated with noncorporeal, living beings compare to that directed toward embodied animals and nonliving bodies? Will this comparison make for a useful extrahuman rhetoric of disposedness, of attunement, of a going along together with one another?</p>
