Like smoking cigars, col lecting was a guilty pleasure, one that Freud playfully described as an addiction in light of the considerable financial and psychological resources it demanded.1 Unlike most collectors, Freud invested his objects not only with exhibition value, but also with use value: his antiquities became instruments for writing, think ing, and even analyzing patients. He placed his most treasured purchases on his desk so he could face them as he wrote, turning them into a captive audience of sorts.2 Freud spoke to his antiquities, used them as paperweights, and would occa sionally rub the head of a statuette. In a letter to Wilhelm Fleiss, he referred to these objects as his gods—albeit "old and grubby gods."3 During analytic sessions, he would sometimes point to one of his ancient artifacts to illustrate the workings of the unconscious.4 Freud even traveled with his antiquities: every summer the family moved to the country for several weeks, and the figurines had to be carefully packed, unpacked, and reinstalled in the new domicile. And when Freud left Vienna for good in 1938, he made the necessary arrangements—including securing the * The material from this article is taken from Freud's Mexico: Into the Wilds of Psychoanalysis (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2010).

Princess Marie Bonaparte, his patroness and one-time analysand, smuggled one of the most prized pieces—a statuette of Athena—out of Austria. And when the end came, Freud's ashes were deposited in a Greek urn at London's Golders Green Crematorium. Much has been written about Freud's collection, but scholars have tended to focus on Freud's Greek, Roman, and Egyptian pieces—objects belonging to three cultures the analyst admired and about which he wrote extensively in his essays.5 The cover of Sigmund Freud and Art—the first major catalogue of Freud's holdings—for instance, features a winged sphinx, a piece directly related to one of the central theo ries of psychoanalysis: the Oedipus complex. Critics have tended to read Freud's antiquities as companion pieces to his writings, assuming that he acquired pieces that illustrated elements of his arguments. How are we to make sense of the antiquities from other cultures, those with no obvious counterpart in Freud's theories? How are we to read the African, Indian, and Chinese artifacts in his collection? These objects came from places Freud never visited or discussed in his work, and their presence in the collection raises an impor tant question: what role did cultural alterity play in Freud's practice of collecting? And how did he perceive the difference between the various cultures—Greek and Egyptian, Chinese and Roman—represented in his collection? The question becomes even more complex when it comes to Freud's pre 5.

Freud owned three pieces from American civilizations that do not fit into any of the schemas used to interpret the collection: they are—at least at first sight—not related to psychoanalytic texts or concepts, nor do they seem to have a connection to places, like Greece or Rome, which Freud had invested with special significance. One might be tempted to dismiss these pieces as anomalies in a collection that is otherwise coherent and unified. But Freud himself taught us that every detail, regardless of how small or insignificant it appears, can be interpreted to uncover a web of unsuspected associations. Freud's pre-Columbian holdings consist of a Moche figure from Peru that has been described as "vase depicting a dignitary" and two Mexican objects: a kneel ing figure from West Mexico and an anthropomorphic stone object from Mezcala.6 These objects have drawn little attention from scholars: they have not been included in most exhibitions of Freud's antiquities—including a show of Freud's antiquities held in a museum in Mexico City! The three pre-Columbian objects have never been published together or analyzed as a group.7 In the pages that follow, I propose to interpret these pieces with the following questions in mind: where did these objects come from? What role did pre-Columbian art play in Freud's collec tion? How did these objects influence Freud's perception of the Americas in general and of Mexico in particular? 6.

Interestingly, Freud's objects were not cre ated by any of these empires but by the relatively marginal peoples of West Mexico and the Moche. Freud's pre-Columbian objects share a number of attrib utes: all three pieces originated in remote areas far from the powerful urban centers of the Inca and the Aztecs. They were made by peoples who had no writ ing, left no record of their history or beliefs, and vanished well before the arrival of the Spaniards. And, perhaps more importantly, all three were funerary objects, designed to be buried alongside the dead in tombs that were looted long before archaeologists had the opportunity to explore them. In this respect, the three pre-Columbian pieces fit perfectly in a collection that included many other examples of tomb art, from fragments of Egyptian mummies to fragments of Roman sarcophagi. But how did these pre-Columbian artifacts make their way from the Americas to Vienna? Freud purchased most of his antiquities from local dealers, but he also received some as presents from patients and friends. Freud did not keep any records on the pre-Columbian pieces, and no documents have survived that could explain how these objects arrived at Berggasse 19, Freud's Viennese address for the last decades of his life. The two Mexican objects pose a much greater challenge for the scholar than the Peruvian piece, which some have related to Freud's early work on cocaine. With the exception of a footnote on the Aztecs, Freud never wrote about pre-Columbian Mexico.8 And he never had a Mexican disciple who could have sent the pieces as presents. Freud might have acquired them on his own, but there was vir tually no market for American antiquities in Vienna before World War II. The Mexican pieces thus occupy a place in the collection of antiquities that is as eccentric—and as puzzling—as that of the single Mexican book in Freud's library.9 How are we to interpret them? How do they relate to the other objects in Freud's collection? Could there be any unsuspected links between these objects and Freud's theories? Could they provide some clues about the analyst's percep tion of Mexico? Freud's Mexican Library Freud's life coincided with an explosion of interest in Aztec Mexico among Austrian, German, and French intellectuals. In 1916, Walter Benjamin moved to Munich to attend a series of seminars, including one given by the Americanist 8.

Benjamin was fascinated by the Aztecs and recorded two dreams about them in One-Way Street: in one, he sees a "Mexican shrine from the time of pre-animism, from the Anaquivitlzi,"10 and in the other he encounters "a priest rais[ing] a Mexican fetish."11 In 1918, Eduard Stucken (an author Freud had in his library) published Die weissen Gotter, a novel about the conquest of Mexico, with the "white gods" denoting the Spanish conquistadors.12 Two years later, in 1920, Gerhart Hauptmann wrote a play based on Stucken's novel: Der weisse Heiland (The white savior) was staged, with much fanfare, throughout Germany and Austria. One of the productions featured a replica of "Moctezuma's headdresss" held in the collec tions of the Museum of Natural History. Even Oswald Spengler succumbed to the lure of the Aztecs: his archive at the Munich State Library includes an unpub lished play titled Montezuma: ein TrauerspieL13 The Aztec-mania caught on in other European countries. In France, Georges Bataille devoted his 1928 essay "Extinct America" to analyzing the Aztecs's "demented violence," and their pantheon of anthropophagic gods. Bataille painted the Aztec rituals as a "bloody eccentricity, surely the most extreme ever conceived by an aberrant mind. Continuous crime committed in broad daylight for the mere sat isfaction of deified nightmares, terrifying phantasms."14 Bataille—who would revisit the theme of Aztec sacrifice in his novels and essays of the 1920s and '30s—provided one of the most original explanations to the mystery of how the Spaniards conquered Mexico with only a few hundred men: the Aztecs, he argued, chose to die in a massive human sacrifice.15 In 1935, Elias Canetti published Auto-da-Fe, which included a nightmare sequence of Aztec human sacrifice: instead of blood, books flow from the victim's open chest: "Human sacrifices he had heard of," remarks the character, "but books, books!"16 Even French cinema partici pated in this excitement: Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game (1939) features an elegant woman named Jackie who announces to her aristocratic friends that she has taken up the study of pre-Columbian art only to be derided as an intellectual fashion victim by the other guests.

Perhaps the horrors experienced by Europe during World War I had made the theme of human sacrifice particularly relevant to intellectuals. Alas, none of these Aztec-philic authors are represented in Freud's library. But the library does include three books that include lengthy discussions of Ancient Mexico: Sir James George Frazer's The Golden Bough, Heinrich Heine's Romanzero, and, to a lesser extent, Robertson Smith's Lectures on the Religions of the Semites,17 These are authors Freud knew well—Frazer and Smith are the main sources for Totem and Taboo, and Heine is cited frequently in Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious—and their views on Aztec culture would have influenced Freud's ideas about Mexico ... and about the pre-Columbian objects in his collection. Frazer's Mexico The eleven volumes of Frazer's The Golden Bough constitute the most ambi tious, encyclopedic, and controversial collection of worldwide myths ever published. Pre-Columbian Mexico is an important reference throughout this mon umental study: Frazer writes at length about the Aztecs and, to a lesser degree, about other Indian groups in Mexico. Frazer was especially interested in the Aztec practice of ritual sacrifice—a topic he explores in depth in two chapters of The Golden Bough: "Eating the God among the Aztecs" (in the volume Spirits of the Corn and the Wild) and "Killing the God in Mexico" (a section of The Scapegoat). Frazer was both fascinated and horri fied by this ritual, which he called "the most monstrous on record."18 He noted that in pre-Columbian Mexico "more people used to be sacrificed on the altar than died a natural death."19 The first of these chapters, "Eating the God in Mexico," analyzes "the cus tom of eating bread sacramentally as the body of a god" as part of a wider discussion about "spirits of the corn and the wild." Frazer describes the ritual of solemnly ingesting an edible image of "Huitzilopochtli or Vitzliputzli." Priests made a likeness of the god out of maize and honey paste, carried it to the top of a pyramid, and then fed it to the worshippers in [the] manner of a communion, beginning with the greater, and con tinuing unto the rest, both men, women, and little children, who received it with such tears, fear, and reverence as it was an admirable thing, saying that they did eat the flesh and bones of God, wherewith they grieved.20 17.

"The Mexicans," he wrote, "did not always content themselves with eating their gods in the outward and visible shape of bread or grain," even in cases when the dough was "kneaded and fortified with human blood." But the people aspired for "a closer union with the living god, and attained it by devouring the flesh of a real man, who, after he had paraded for a time in the trappings and received the honors of a god, was slaughtered and eaten by his cannibal worshippers." Once dead, "instead of being kicked down the stair case and sent rolling from step to step like the corpses of common victims, the body of the dead god was carried respectfully down, and his flesh, chopped up small, was distributed among the priests and nobles as a blessed food."23 Frazer saw these ceremonies as exemplifying "the custom of entering into communion with a god by eating his effigy."24 He believed that the intention of these rituals was two-fold: to keep the corn spirits alive and to allow the worshippers to par take—by eating a likeness—in a portion of the god's divinity.25 Frazer merely touched on sacrificial rituals in Spirits of the Corn and the Wild, but he presented a more elaborate discussion in The Scapegoat, a volume that devotes an entire chapter to the practice of "killing the god in Mexico." "Among no other people," he writes, "does the custom of sacrificing the human represen tative of a god appear to have been observed so commonly and with so much solemnity as by the Aztecs of Mexico."26 Frazer found these sacrificial rituals shocking, but he was even more dis turbed by another Aztec practice: cannibalism. He describes, in gruesome detail, the anthropophagic rituals involving prisoners captured in warfare.27 Frazer concludes that the sacrifice of these human deities constituted "a means of perpetuating the divine energies in the fullness of youthful vigour, untainted by the weakness and frailty of age, from which they must have suffered if the deity had been allowed to die a natural death."28 Through these rituals, "the priests attempted not merely to revive the gods whom they had just slain in the 21.

Totem and Taboo, the only work in which Freud refers to ancient Mexico, notes that "the human sacrifices of the Aztecs [which] have been reported in detail by Frazer in the fifth part of his great work," constitute a good example of the sacramental nature of sacrificial rituals.30 Like the English anthropologist, Freud associated pre-Columbian Mexico with the bloody rituals of killing and eating sacrificial vic tims. But as we will see further on, his reaction to these practices was quite different than Frazer's. Heine's Mexico In addition to The Golden Bough, Freud owned another book that dwelt at length on Aztec rituals: Heinrich Heine's Romanzero (1851), a collection that included "Vitzliputzli," a mock-epic about the conquest of Mexico. This mischie vous poem, written in the 1840s while Heine was exiled in Paris, could not be more different in tone and spirit from Frazer's anthropological texts. "Vitzliputzli" recasts the story of the conquest of Mexico as a German Romantic tale. The poem opens with a prelude hailing America as a bright new land that "shines with sea-fresh colors" and "drips with pearls or water," in contrast to an old Europe that has degenerated into "a romantic's graveyard" and an "ancient junk yard."31 The action begins with the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in Mexico and their first encounter with the Aztecs. Heine does not show much sympathy for the Spanish leader, Hernan Cortes, whom he calls "a bandit" and "a robber cap tain."32 In contrast, Moctezuma, the Aztec emperor, appears as a gracious host, showering the foreigners with gifts, only to be kidnapped and murdered by them. His death ignites a violent war, and the Mexicans turn all their rage against the con quistadors: "a stormy tide of terror/mounted like a savage ocean."33 The first section of the poem closes with the Spaniards, beaten and demoralized, retreating from the Aztec city. Heine paints this scene with all the pathos characteristic of Romantic poetry: "Blood flowed red in streaming tor rents/And the bold carousers struggled."34 Even the mighty Cortes breaks down at the sight of the carnage, and we find him "weepy, under weeping wil lows."35 While the Spaniards mourn, the Aztecs prepare to celebrate their 29.

The ceremony, like those described by Frazer in The Golden Bough, takes place on a pyramid. At the summit of this "Red-brick stronghold of the idol—/Strange reminder of Egyptian/Babylon ic and Assyrian/Buildings, monstrous and colossal,"36 we catch the first glimpse of the "bloodthirsty" god Vitzliputztli: There, upon his altar-throneseat Sits the mighty Vitzliputlzi, Mexico's bloodthirsty war god. He's an evil looking monster, But so droll is his exterior, So bedizened and so childish, That in spite of inward shudders Yet he tickles us to laughter.37 After a sacrificial banquet, Viztliputzli's mood turns somber: he predicts an imminent Spanish victory followed by the destruction of his city, the collapse of Aztec civilization, and the twilight of its gods: "Smashed to bits will be my temple," he laments, "I myself will fall and founder/In the ruins—dust and ashes—But Vitzliputzli is a god, and since gods are immortal, he will survive the mayhem: fol lowing the destruction of the Aztec city, Vitzliputzli will flee his homeland and seek refuge in Europe, the land of his enemies, where he will devote his endless life to terrorizing his foes "with torments/Frighten them with ghostly phantoms."38 Heine's portrayal of Ancient Mexico foregrounds the same two themes Frazer presented in The Golden Bough: cannibalism and human sacrifice. Indeed "Vitzliputzli" focuses on the same rituals discussed in Frazer's study, and the two authors consulted the same sources on Aztec religious ceremonies.39 Heine's descriptions of Aztec priests offering the aroma of human blood to their deities while feasting on the flesh of eighty Spaniards would be entirely at home in the catalogue of pre-Columbian atrocities compiled by Frazer. But Heine's attitude towards ancient Mexico could not be more different from Frazer's. From the very first lines of the poem, Heine makes it clear that his sympathies lie with the Aztecs and not with the Europeans: America is a new, fresh land, bursting with colors, smells, and other sensations, while Europe has become an "ancient junkyard."40 Cortes is a bandit; the Aztecs, gracious hosts and courageous fighters.41 36.

Ibid., p. 605.</page><page sequence="11">80 OCTOBER And if Frazer deplored the Aztec sacrificial rituals as "the most monstrous on record," Heine likens them to Spanish customs and draws a parallel between com munion and sacrificial slaying.42 Heine's Aztec priest offers an even more heretical comparison of Christian and Mexican sacrificial rituals. He calls the Spaniards "morally ugly" and views their religion with contempt. "They're even wont to/munch upon their own gods' bodies," he exclaims in disgust, dismissing the foreigners as "god-devourers."43 In the end, Heine's "Vitzliputzli" subverts the opposition between savage and civilized—an opposition that structures most European accounts of Aztec civilization, including The Golden Bough. Though Heine introduces the Aztecs as "savage," he ulti mately presents them as more civilized than the Spaniards: it is the Spanish Christians who backstab, rob, steal, and ultimately adopt a watered-down version of human sacrifice because they cannot stomach the real thing, while the Aztecs are noble, courageous, and in touch with the true nature of sacrificial rituals 44 Heine turns the Aztec priest into a Romantic hero and human sacrifice into a poetic model. His Aztecs are not only civilized, but their rituals surpass those of the Spaniards in theological complexity: Mexican sacrifice is authentic, unlike the pale simulacrum practiced by the Christians. Frazer imagined himself as a poten tial victim of Aztec sacrifice, while Heine identified with Vitzliputzli: like the Mexican god, he was an exile condemned to live far away from his native land and lament its fate. When Freud read Heine's Romanzero, he would have been particularly atten tive to the ending: Vitzliputzli, like libidinal flows, is never destroyed. He disappears from one location to reappear in another—the same procedure Freud attributed to psychic forces. In "The Uncanny," Freud invoked another one of Heine's poems to explain the workings of unconscious repression: in uncanny experiences, he wrote, "the 'double' has become a thing of terror, just as, after the collapse of their religion, the gods turned into demons."45 The analyst was refer ring to Heine's Die Gbtter im Exil, a poem devoted to the same topic as "Vitzliputzli": the exile of deities after the collapse of their cultures. Among so many other things, "Vitzliputzli" is a parable about the return of the repressed. Mexican Taboos The Goldm Bough and Romanzero present two very different models for thinking about the pre-Columbian objects in Freud's collection of antiquities. Frazer's account would have led Freud to perceive the ancient Mexicans as a barbarous and blood thirsty bunch, given to the most extravagant acts of cruelty—rituals that would send 42.

Heine's poetry, on the other hand, would have inspired him to imagine the Aztecs as Romantic heroes, as passionate warriors whose practice of human sacrifice was merely a more honest ver sion of the Christian sacrament of communion. Unlike Frazer, Freud was not easily shocked by either human sacrifice or canni balism. He spent many years thinking about the role of these two practices in the evolution of civilization, and he wrote at length about them in Totem and Taboo—a work that is both an elaboration of and a response to Frazer's The Golden Bough. Human sacrifice and cannibalism play a crucial role in the tale of a primeval parricide told in Totem and Taboo. But for Freud, human sacrifice—the killing of the father by the primal horde—represents the cornerstone of civilization. All religious and social innovations since then, Freud argues, have been attempts to atone for the brothers' deed: first came totemic religion (with its two taboos designed to prevent further killings), followed by the invention of the concept of god ("at bottom God is nothing other than an exalted father"46), which eventually led to the generalized practice of sacrifice ("The object of an act of sacrifice has always been the same—namely, what is now worshipped as God, that is to say, the father"47), before culminating with the appearance of kings ("father surro gates"48). Even the rise of Christianity was merely a sophisticated variation on the primitive crime: "In the Christian doctrine . . . men were acknowledging in the most undisguised manner the guilty primeval deed, since they found the fullest atonement for it [the murder of the father] in the sacrifice of his son."49 Freud is especially interested in the emergence of sacrifice as an integral ele ment of religious practice. At its origin, he writes, it was offered directly to God—a paternal substitute—as a way of atoning for the killing: "The importance which is everywhere, without exception, ascribed to sacrifice lies in the fact that it offers satisfaction to the father for the outrage inflicted on him."50 But sacrifice, which always involves the slaying of animals or humans, is also a symbolic repeti tion of the primitive murder—the worshippers direct their murderous impulses against a paternal substitute taking the form of an animal or human. Sacrifice is a symbolically ambivalent deed: it is meant to atone for the patricide through an act that is also its symbolic repetition, or, as Freud puts it, sacrifice "offers satisfaction to the father for the outrage inflicted on him in the same act in which that deed is commemorated."51 Totem and Taboo links human sacrifice to cannibalism, one of the practices both Frazer and Heine associated with Mexico. The horde of brothers, Freud explains, went from crime to anthropophagic feast: "Cannibal savages as they 46. Freud, Totem and Taboo, p. 147. 47. Ibid., p. 151. 48. Ibid. 49. Ibid., p. 154. 50. Ibid., p. 151. 51. Ibid.</page><page sequence="13">82 OCTOBER were, it goes without saying that they devoured their victim as well as killing him."52 But if the murder was sparked by an irruption of hostile impulses, the act of cannibalism stemmed from more complex feelings: "The violent primal father had doubtless been the feared and envied model of each one of the company of brothers: and in the act of devouring him they accomplished their identification with him, and each of them acquired a portion of his strength."53 Cannibalism is the cornerstone of identification, a fundamental psychoana lytic concept. The father might have been a ruthless tyrant, but there were many aspects of him that the brothers admired: his strength, his power, his sex appeal. After his death, the brothers yearned to become like him—or at least like the por tion of his personality they respected and admired. And since they had no more complex mechanisms at their disposal, they decided to eat him: by incorporating a portion of the dead body, each of them would be able to carry with him a piece— a good piece—of the father. If the brothers killed their father out of hatred, they ate him out of love. Or, to put it in slightly different terms, Freud considered can nibalism a primitive—perhaps the most primitive—expression of love. Like sacrifice, this primitive act of cannibalism underwent a series of trans formations through the ages: it was first commemorated by the totem meal, in which a father substitute, the totem animal, was eaten by the group; with time the ritual became more abstract, until the advent of Christianity, a religion in which "the ancient totem meal was revived in the form of communion, in which the com pany of brothers consumed the flesh and blood of the son—no longer the father—obtained sanctity thereby and identified themselves with him."54 Freud stresses that Christianity, the religion of civilized Europe, features as its most important sacrament a symbolic repetition of the cannibalistic feast celebrated by the primal horde.55 Freud's argument turned his readers—at least the Christians among them—into cannibals of sorts who continued to symbolically eat the flesh of a paternal figure even while condemning, like Frazer, the anthropophagic ritu als practiced by "primitive" peoples. We can thus see how greatly Freud's views on human sacrifice and cannibalism differed from those expressed by Frazer and Heine. Unlike Frazer, Freud did not believe that these practices were the exclusive domain of savages living in far-away lands. If Frazer established a rigid distinction between civilization and barbarism, between rational Europeans and cannibalistic Indians, Freud insisted on the continu ity of these violent impulses from the primal horde to the present, emphasizing how the most refined accomplishments of civilization—including the institutions of reli gion and the law—are built on a foundation of anthropophagic sacrifice. Freud is closer in spirit to Heine. The poet's comparison of Christian com munion and Mexican theanthropic sacrifice fits within the elegant scheme 52. Ibid., p. 142. 53. Ibid. 54.

But there is an important difference between the analyst and the poet: while Heine falls under the sway of the Romantic myth of the noble savage and renders his Aztecs more authentic and more passionate than their Spanish counterparts, Freud refuses to idealize either savages ... or his con temporaries. Our civilization might have developed institutions to keep violent impulses at bay, but at bottom, modern man differs very little from the murder ous horde of brothers. Freud believes that the impulse to kill and eat the father has not been extinguished; it has merely undergone a series of transformations and developments through the ages. And, as he would later argue in Civilization and Its Discontents, our supposedly civilized world is ever on the brink of sliding back into barbarism. While most European intellectuals in the early twentieth century saw the Aztecs as cruel practitioners of human sacrifice and cannibalism, Freud would have considered them simply as a people who openly displayed the hostile impulses that are part and parcel of human nature. He actually places the Aztecs within the historical overview presented in Totem and Taboo: more advanced than the primal horde—they had developed a sophisticated religion, solid social insti tutions, and had moved beyond the totem meal and animal sacrifices—the Aztecs were still practicing the kind of theanthropic sacrifices cataloged by Frazer. Unlike the Spaniards, they had not yet elevated sacrificial cannibalism into a sym bolic ritual, and thus they remained bound to a recurring, literal repetition of the primeval killing of the father. "We can trace through the ages," writes Freud, "the identity of the totem meal with animal sacrifice, with theanthropic human sacri fice, and with the Christian Eucharist, and we can recognize in all these rituals the effect of the crime by which men were so deeply weighed down but of which they must none the less feel so proud."56 Freud does not comment on the horror experienced by the Spaniards at the discovery of Aztec religion, but he would have perhaps interpreted it as a classic example of the uncanny: an overwhelming sense of anxiety experienced at the sight of an act repressed from conscious memory. What had been repressed from civilized Europe—the killing that was the founding act of civilization—returned with shock ing literalism in Aztec sacrifice: what the Spaniards repeated metaphorically in the ritual of the Eucharist, the Aztecs commemorated literally, by selecting a father fig ure to sacrifice and devour. The anxiety produced by this deja vu would explain the violence with which Europeans reacted to Aztec sacrificial ceremonies. Totem, Taboo, and Multiculturalism One remarkable feature of the historical account presented in Totem and Taboo is its capacity to accommodate every culture and religious system, from animism to Judaism and from Aboriginal totemism to Christianity. Freud's schema can account 56. Ibid.</page><page sequence="15">84 OCTOBER for Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and even pre-Columbian belief systems. In his con ception, all of these religions worship a god that functions as a father substitute and stage rituals that are symbolic repeti tions of the primal killing. Like The Golden Bough, Totem and Taboo aspires to universality. But if Frazer proceeds like an encyclopedist, catalogu ing the world's myriad myths and rituals, Freud acts as a theorist, devising a single schema to account for the totality of reli gious beliefs. Frazer assumes a complete discontinuity between European civiliza- Max Pollack Freud tion and savage peoples; Freud, on the at His Desk. 1913. other hand, focuses on the shared psychic traits linking civilization and barbarism, European and non-European peoples. The approaches taken by Freud and Frazer correspond to the differences between their disciplines: anthropology highlights cultural differences, while psy choanalysis treats national and ethnic differences, like religion, as mere illusions. Psychoanalytic theory emphasizes the universality of unconscious structures— complexes, anxieties, fears, desires—and the shared psychic traits among people of different cultures. Totem and Taboo, for instance, insists on the Oedipus complex as a fundamental structure of the human psyche, found alike in Aborigines, pre Columbians, and Europeans. Cultures and religions might undergo radical transformations across time and space, but the essential component of the Oedipus complex remains constant. The schema presented in Totem and Taboo can be applied to the belief sys tems of ancient Peru, contemporary Africa, or medieval Spain. In this sense, Freud was a multiculturalist avant la lettre: Rather than stressing national speci ficities, as many of his contemporaries did, Freud emphasizes the common traits linking peoples and cultures across geographical, linguistic, religious, and politi cal borders. In his view, the unconscious—as well as the structures of the psychic apparatus—are universal attributes of humankind, and no one culture can lay claim to them. In Freud and the Non-European, a brilliant little book, Edward Said posits Freud's Moses and Monotheism as a model for thinking about national and ethnic identity. Said notes that Freud's inquiry into the origins of Judaism opens with a shocking hypothesis: Moses was an Egyptian, and thus the founder of the Jewish religion was a non-Jew. Formulated in slightly different terms, Freud's inquiry into the identity of his people places the Other at its center. And if the founding father of Judaism is not Jewish, then Jewish identity is predicated on alterity. "In Max Pollack. Freud at His Desk. 1913.</page><page sequence="16">Freud's Mexican Antiquities 85 excavating the archaeology of Jewish identity," Said writes, "Freud insisted that it did not begin with itself, but rather with other identities (Egyptian and Arabian)."57 This analysis "mobilized the non-European past in order to under mine any doctrinal attempt that might be made to put Jewish identity on a sound foundational basis, whether religious or secular."58 And it is precisely this construction of identity as a dialectical oscillation between self and Other that Freud's museography sets into motion. What I have called Freud's multicultural view—and what Said sees as an open theory of identity—is best illustrated by the arrangement of antiquities on his desk. Out of the hundreds of pieces he owned, Freud selected a handful of prized objects for this privileged spot: these were his most treasured pieces, the "gods" who kept him company as he wrote in his study. As Freud worked on Totem and Taboo between 1912 and 1913, his eyes would have wandered from the paper to the antiquities on his desk, and the figurines accompanied him as he meditated on primal hordes, human sacrifices, and cannibalistic feasts. Examining the antiquities on Freud's desk, as captured in an etching by Max Pollak from 1914, the viewer is struck by their diversity: there are Egyptian, Umbrian, Greek, and Roman figures. By 1938, when Edmund Engelman photographed the interior of Berggasse 19, just before Freud left Vienna, the collection on the desk had grown to encompass Chinese, Mesopotamian, as well as more Roman and Egyptian pieces.59 In addition, the vitrines in his study and consulting room held other objects from Africa, the Americas, and the Far East. Freud's private pantheon was truly mul ticultural: a veritable sampling of civilizations ranging from Southern Europe to the Far East, and from the Americas to Oceania. Freud's collecting was characterized by a Franciscanism of cultures—to para phrase Roland Barthes' assessment of Severo Sarduy's narrative technique.60 He opened the door of Berggasse 19 to representatives from every imaginable ancient civilization, Eastern and Western, Southern and Northern. And all pieces shared the same space: Freud refused to segregate them according to national or geo graphic origin, or even to submit them to the logic of chronological ordering. His desk and vitrines became egalitarian territories in which Greek and Roman antiq uities—longstanding symbols of European high culture—rubbed shoulders with North-African and Asian figures. Freud's egalitarian museography is all the more striking if we consider that in the early decades of the twentieth century—the period in which Freud devoted the most energy to his collection—most museums moved in the opposite direction, carv ing out separate spaces for European and non-European antiquities.

Roland Barthes, Le Plaisir du texte (Paris: Seuil, 1973).</page><page sequence="17">86 OCTOBER Vienna, Franz Josef inaugurated two grand institutions structured by this cultural divide: the Art History and the Natural History museums, built on opposite sides of a plaza on the Ringstrasse and opened with great fanfare in 1891 and 1889, respec tively. The city's cultural officials exhibited Greek, Roman, and Egyptian antiquities at the Museum of Art History, presenting these ancient cultures as precursors to the Italian Renaissance and Austrian baroque paintings housed under the same roof; Mexican, Peruvian, and Asian objects, on the other hand, were sent across the street, where they shared gallery space with mineral collec tions, prehistoric fossils, the Emperor's meteorite samples, and other products of "natural" history. The cultural divide separating European and non-European antiquities became even more pronounced in 1928, when the city inaugurated the Museum of Ethnography, in the Hofburg, the Palace on the Ringstrasse that lost its imperial tenants after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. This new museum became—and continues to be—the repository of the nation's Asian, pre-Columbian, and African collections. Like Totem and Taboo, Civilization and its Discontents, and Moses and Monotheism, Freud's museography is an experiment in applied psychoanalysis. Freud treats antiquities as universal products of the psyche, as evidence that Chinese and Egyptians, Greeks and Africans shared the same complexes and fantasies. Like the unconscious, the antiquities grouped in Freud's collection exist in a realm that is timeless: 4,000-year-old Egyptian masks sit next to Greek vases from the fifth century BCE and Mexican pieces from the pre-Columbian era—as if the same creative drive had remained constant through the ages. Freud's egalitarian arrangement seems to stress that the antiquities ultimately came from the same place: from the unconscious creative processes of artisans and artists. If Freud had opened a museum in Vienna, it would have been nei ther art-historical, nor ethnographic: it would have been a Museum des Unbewussten, a Museum of the Unconscious. Freud Amid Moctezuma '5 Treasures In addition to his readings, Freud would have come into contact with an important collection of Mexican antiquities during his frequent visits to the Viennese museums of Art History and Natural History, where he often met Julius Banko, director of the antiquities collection and an expert who authenticated some of his purchases.61 Banko worked at the Museum of Art History. Across the street, the Museum of Natural History held one of Europe's most important collections of Mexican antiquities, including several Aztec pieces sent to Europe during the first days of the conquest. This collection has an unusual and fascinating history 61.

The Museum of Natural History (designed by Carl Hasenauer and founded in the 1870s) started with a small but valuable collection that included an Aztec headdress and other rare examples of Mexican feather art that had been sent to Europe shortly after the conquest. The first director, Ferdinand von Hochstetter (1829-1884), spent the first years of his tenure enlarging the collection and purchasing important holdings of Mexican art scat tered throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In only a few years, he acquired some of the Empire's most important American objects, including the Ambras Collection—assembled by Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol in the late six teenth century—as well as the collection amassed by Maximilian von Hapsburg during his years in Mexico. By the time the Museum of Natural History opened to the public, its hold ings had grown exponentially to include hundreds of Mexican objects: Aztec featherwork, stone sculptures from Central Mexico, slate artifacts from Mezcala, and even various codices. The Mexican collection was among the most impor tant in Europe, and it also attested to the close historical ties that had bound Austria and Mexico since the sixteenth century: at the time of the conquest, Spain was ruled by a Hapsburg, Charles V, an heir to the dynasty that to this day Spanish speakers call "la casa de los Austrias." During the rule of this "Austrian" monarch, hundreds of treasures were shipped from the Americas to Europe; Charles V distributed them among relatives and friends, and many of the pieces eventually wound up in Austria. The treasures sent to Charles V from the Americas included the set of objects known as "Moctezuma's presents." In 1519, when Cortes and his men dis embarked on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the Aztec emperor Moctezuma sent an envoy to present the newcomers with a treasure trove of gifts. Cortes accepted</page><page sequence="19">88 OCTOBER the goods, catalogued them, and sent them to the king. Charles took them to Belgium in 1520, where they were seen by Albrecht Diirer—an artist Freud admired and whose engravings decorated his study.62 In his diary, Diirer mar veled at the exotic beauty of these Mexican treasures.63 Moctezuma's presents were dispersed in the centuries following the con quest, but at least two—a mosaic shield and a codex—surfaced in Vienna, where they can still be seen today at the Museum of Ethnography and the Prunksaal.64 The historical ties binding Austria to Mexico remained strong. In 1908, an American archaeologist named Zelia Nuttall traveled to Vienna to attend the International Congress of Americanists and stunned her audience with a paper arguing that the feather headdress in the Museum of Natural History had belonged to the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma and was part of the original set of gifts sent by Cortes to Charles V. Even though this hypothesis has since been proven wrong (the object is indeed from the sixteenth century, but it cannot be traced to Moctezuma), it turned the headdress into one of the museum's main attractions. Freud would have most likely been impressed by the sight of it, made of bright quetzal feathers, and, like most of his contemporaries, he would have believed that it once belonged to Moctezuma, the melancholic ruler who met such a tragic fate and had inspired a long tradition of European iconogra phy depicting him as a majestic hero in all his glory. Some scholars believe that the headdress was actually part of a Huitzilopochtli outfit worn by Aztec priests—a hypothesis that would link the celebrated object to the long tradition of Vitzliputzli imagery represented in Heine's poetry and Frazer's studies. But Charles V was not the last Hapsburg with a Mexican connection—or the last one to send antiquities to Vienna. In 1864, Maximilian, the younger brother of Franz Josef, Emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, accepted an outlandish offer concocted by Napoleon III as part of his Machiavellian designs to expand the French territories and became Emperor of Mexico. Maximilian was a collector, and he spent a good deal of his three years in Mexico acquiring hundreds of Aztec and Maya sculptures. Maximilian was so serious about this project that he founded an Imperial Museum in Mexico City that was devoted, like its Viennese model, to archaeology and natural history. The Emperor appointed a fellow Austrian, a Cistercian priest named Dominik Bilimek, as its first director. 62. Freud owned three prints by Diirer. One was a present from Emmanuel Lowy.

Bilimek escaped from the imperial misadventure, and returned to Vienna with an exten sive collection of his own that he eventually sold to the same museum. The Museum of Natural History not only housed an important collection of Mexikanische Kostbarkeiten—"Mexican treasures," as they are still known—but, since so many of its objects were the remnants of Hapsburg imperial ventures, it also doubled as a Museum of Austro-Mexican relations. Walking through the Mexican galleries, Freud surely pondered the bloody rituals described by Frazer and Heine for which so many of the objects on display were made to serve; and he must have meditated on the close ties that bound Austrians of his generation to Mexican sacrifi cial violence: Maximilian's execution—one of the most traumatic events in nineteenth-cen tury Austrian history—was perceived by his contemporaries as proof that human sacrifice persisted in Mexico 400 years after the Conquest. Unlike most of his compatriots, Freud would have considered the execution of Maximilian not as an outburst of Mexican sav agery, but as a dramatic illustration of the ideas presented in Totem and Taboo. His essay argued that one of the most primitive traits in the human psyche involved a murderous impulse against father figures—a primal drive that had often erupted into actual killings of kings, rulers, or prophets. Freud analyzed many instances of these historical murders— the father of the primal horde, Moses, Christ—and he would have seen Maximilian's execution as yet another eruption of the Oedipal tensions that were part and parcel of human nature. As he strolled through Vienna's Natural History Museum, Freud would have witnessed the evidence of Austria's long and complicated ties to Mexico: he would have seen gifts given by Moctezuma to Cortes, treasures sent from New Spain to Charles V, antiquities amassed by Maximilian, and stone sculptures pur chased by Bilimek for the Imperial Museum. As he contemplated these objects, Freud would have recalled his readings on Mexico: Frazer's hair-raising accounts of Aztec cannibalism and human sacrifice; Robertson Smith's discussion of Nineteenth-century engraving of Moctezuma.</page><page sequence="21">90 OCTOBER theantropic rituals; and Heine's mischievous tale of a defeated Vitzliputzli who decided to spend the rest of his days tormenting Europeans to avenge the destruction of Aztec culture. Upon returning home to Berggasse, Freud would have seen his own collec tion of antiquities as a miniature version of the imperial museums: his rooms, filled with Greek vases and Roman figurines were a small-scale recreation of the classical galleries of the Museum of Art History; and his Chinese screens, Japanese figurines, and pre-Columbian objects echoed the much larger hold ings of the Museum of Natural History. But unlike the museums on the Ringstrasse, Freud did not carve out separate spaces for his European and non European antiquities. In Freud's home museum, Roman statuettes rubbed shoulders with Chinese animals, and Hellenic figurines stood under Egyptian masks. The Moche vase was stored in the same case as Greek vases, and although we can't be certain of the exact location of the Mexican pieces, we know they were housed under the same roof as the many other Western and non-Western pieces. Conclusion But perhaps Freud's museography, in which Mexican, Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities share the same space, calls for a slightly more pessimistic reading. Could not Freud's refusal to allocate separate spaces to the various peo ples in his collection be read as a denial of cultural difference? Doesn't his arrangement of objects ignore the deep differences between Greek and Chinese, Peruvian and Egyptian cultures, collapsing them all into an overarch ing concept of "the primitive"? Could Freud's museography be interpreted as another instance of the many efforts by Europeans to deny the importance of American cultures? After Columbus's discovery, European intellectuals were baffled by the sudden emer gence of a new continent inhabited by a people who were radically different from all existing cultural paradigms. Faced with an enigmatic America, some argued that the cultures of the Aztecs and the Inca were not new, but merely variations of civilizations that were already known. One of the most famous of these deniers of American originality was the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher. In his Oedipus Aegyptiacus, Kircher argued that Aztec religion was simply a variant of Egyptian idolatry: like the Egyptians, the Mexicans built pyramids, practiced a polytheistic cult, and worshipped the sun. "It seems to surpass all marvels," Kircher concluded, "that the Egyptian rites traveled as far as the New World, separated by a nearly endless interruption of land and sea."65 Others argued that Mexico was settled by the lost tribes of Israel, or by Phoenicians or Carthaginians. All of these hypotheses had one element in com 65. Athanasius Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652-54), p. 417.</page><page sequence="22">Freud's Mexican Antiquities 91 mon: they denied the cultural originality of American civilizations by assimilating them into cultural models that were already known to the Europeans. As Octavio Paz has written, "It would not be an exaggeration to conclude that the discovery of America was followed by a long period of covering-up [encubrimiento]. We had to wait until the end of the eighteenth century for the beginning of the slow dis covery of American civilizations—a process that has not yet concluded. ... To accept the originality of the two great American civilizations—Andean and Mesoamerican—was and still is difficult."66 Did Freud's museography, like Kircher's Oedipus Aegyptiacus, amount to a denial of the originality of American civilizations? Did the placement of Mexican and Peruvian antiquities in a room filled with Egyptian, Greek, and Roman antiq uities serve to flatten out the differences among the people who created these objects? Did Freud, like Kircher, believe that the Aztecs and the Incas were ulti mately indistinguishable from the Egyptians? Would Paz have criticized Freud's display of Mexican and Peruvian pieces as yet another example of the "covering up" of American cultures? Kircher and his followers gave primacy of place to European civilization and considered all other cultures—from China to Mexico—as derivative, but Freud had a different set of values. If we look at Freud's desk as the central exhibition space of his museum, we discover that Europe does not have a monopoly over the center: Greek and Roman figurines, longstanding symbols of European civilization, share center stage with Chinese jades and even a new world porcupine cast in bronze—a souvenir from Freud's only visit to America in 1909.67 Freud placed objects from non-European civilizations at the center of his museum, refusing to establish a hierarchy between European and non-European cultures. Unlike ethnocentric critics, he did not see distant civilizations as mere copies of a superior European model; and unlike Europhobic thinkers, he did not merely invert the equation to make Europe's Others into noble savages. Freud's museum refuses all hierarchies and places European and non-European cultures on the same plane ... and on the same desk. Earlier I discussed Edward Said's claim that by making Moses into a non Jew, Moses and Monotheism placed alterity at the center of Freud's construction of Judaism as a polyvalent identity. Freud reached a similar conclusion through the excavation of the archaeological past represented by his collection of antiqui ties: digging further and further into the origins of civilization, he discovered that the earliest artistic representations sprung, simultaneously, in Europe, Egypt, China, Japan, Mexico, and Peru. There is not a single one of these cul tures that trumps the other, not one that can claim primacy over the rest. 66.

Freud could have taken Rimbaud's famous utterance—"Je est un autre"—as the motto for his museum of antiquities, but he might have added that je—the "I" of every speaking subject—is not only an other but is also unconscious. Or rather, as Said suggested, identity—whether European or non-European—is built on the double pillars of the unconscious and alterity: 'Je suis inconscient" and "L'inconscient est un autre"—an otherness that Freud highlighted in his collecting practice.</page></plain_text>
