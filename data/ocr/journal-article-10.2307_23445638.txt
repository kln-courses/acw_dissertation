<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW Dipak Bhattacharya (transi.), Mythological and Ritual Symbolism. A Study with Reference to the Vedic and Tantric Agni. X + 243 pp. Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, Calcutta, 1984. The existing scientific works on religion concerning Agni in ancient and medieval India will have a valuable supplement in the present study. The basic principle followed by the author proves itself to be a sound ground for his discussions and conclusions. The author rightly states that the Veda should not be regarded as static and uninfluenced by its social surroundings (p. 206). Indeed belief in any unchange ability in Vedic or post-Vedic thought is far from the author's inten tions; he stresses enquiring into the fundamental changes in the intellectual process (p. 22). At the same time Bhattacharya is fully aware of the dialectical correlation of the static and the dynamic: It cannot be denied that there is an element of continuity in Indian thought, but that cannot reduce the importance of certain far-reaching changes in outlook that took place in course of the development of Indian philosophy (p. 20). With this and other theses Bhattacharya has built up for himself a starting position with a scientifically irreproachable foundation. However, a few other views he expresses require still further discus sion — for example, the assertion that there was already philosophical thinking in the early Vedic period, but that there was no separation of poetry and philosophy (p. 179). Here it is necessary to consider the work of those Indologists who, like Walter Ruben, held that Indian philosophy began mainly with Uddâlaka Aruni, that is with the oldest Upanisads. In the introductory chapter, Bhattacharya gives a short summary of the basic ideas on myth of R. Roth, H. Oldenberg, K. F. Geldner, A. Bergaigne, H. Lüders and others. But instead of confining himself to a mere summary, Bhattacharya subjects his predecessors to critical Journal of Indian Philosophy 19: 325—329,1991.</page><page sequence="2">326 REVIEW examination where it appears necessary to him, and thus in general most of his conclusions develop by way of a critical examination of existing views. He comes to the conclusion that for the above mentioned scholars linguistic studies stood much above those of the history of ideas, and remarks on p. 4, "The emphasis on linguistic studies is a distinct feature of Western Vedic research". But it should be added that this once justified statement cannot command such exclusive validity today. When Bhattacharya comes to speak on the role of Agni, he observes quite rightly that this god has played a significant role from the time of the RV till the end of the medieval age and has preserved his importance throughout this period of time. Another peculiarity of Agni lies in the fact that he is hardly subjected to anthropomorphism (p. 12). In addition, the author comments upon the creative power of imagination and personification as main factors in the formation of myths (p. 11). Future researchers on Agni will have to take account of this chapter. The second chapter which deals with Agni's birth starts with RV IV. 1, and repeatedly refers back to this hymn. On the basis of an exact translation of this and other hymns Bhattacharya clarifies the connexion of Agni and Rta. Agni's birth signifies the beginning of the streams of Rta. The reader follows a lively, interesting discussion of the views of various Indologists on the origin of Agni. Particular reference may be made here to the statement that Yàska allows only direct equation: a word directly expresses one particular meaning; by contrast symbolism is based on laksaná, namely the relation between a primary sense and a secondary sense (p. 55 and 129). On a different point, that Agni, as soon as he was born, had filled up the heaven, atmosphere and earth, he is in any case correct. But one might not follow the author without reservation when he terms this 'Vedic monism' (p. 89), nor when he defines monism as 'matter cum-spirit' unity (p. 132). Beside the analysis of the personality of Agni Bhattacharya again and again invites the reader to somewhat extended discussions, e.g., over trih sapta or over rtasya yoni, from where, however, one is repeatedly carried back to the starting point — hymn IV. 1. The historian of religion will find particularly much of interest in those expositions of the author which are devoted to the connexion of</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW 327 Agni with other gods and their interdependence. So Bhattacharya states correctly that Agni and Indra exhibit fundamental differences. In this Bhattacharya shows his difference from A. A. Macdonnell and particularly from H. P. Schmidt. Already in the Preface Bhattacharya points out against Schmidt that as an epithet añgiras is used much more for Agni than for Indra. In the Vala-myth, Indra is no king priest; kingship and Brahminhood did not go together then. This reviewer agrees with the exhaustive evidence presented here. In addition, Bhattacharya argues that Brhaspati, too, is different from Agni and was more strongly subjected to anthropomorphism. The way in which Bhattacharya analyses the role of the Añgirases and their relation to Agni and Indra is of special methodological significance. The presentation of tables and their full utilisation may be singled out as exemplary. The main result is the confirmation that añgiras is not an adjective used for Agni, but is an epithet. From mythology the third chapter takes one to ritual and deals with the birth of Agni in the Agnyàdheya. For this Bhattacharya gives a correct justification of why this ritual, against the Agnicayana, is to be regarded as representative. Similarly, his assertion that both the Bràhmanas and the Srautasütras should be taken into consideration, since they supplement each other, is to the point. Also the selection of the Àpastamba-Srautasùtra as the main source, evidently resting on L. Renou's Vocabulaire du rituel vedique, is to be approved. Against this, the author's assertion, "the Srautasütras are generally post-Upanisadic" (p. 139) is incorrect. Baudhàyana and Làtyàyana are quite definitely earlier than the Maitràyanïya or the Mândûkya-Upanisad. In cases like this, one should compare only individual works with each other and not a general category as a whole with another entire general category. The author first describes the sacrificial procedure and undertakes an exposition of the root jan. Agni's vrddhi is the principal signifi cance and aim of the Agnyàdheya. Bhattacharya finds the oldest notion of the origin of Agni, namely self-reproduction in the waters, reflected in the ritual, as well as Agni's universality in the three fires (p. 155 ff). The reader finds here further valuable discussions on the Hotr-formulae which up until now have remained obscure; these evidently reflect deliberations over defining the genesis of the sacrifice (p. 178). The fourth chapter is very brief. It occupies itself first with a</page><page sequence="4">328 REVIEW description of the Agnijanana, the Tantric fire-ritual. While the theory, aim and modus procedendi of the Tantra deviate from the Veda, here too one discerns the idea of imitation — that of anthropomorphic reproduction in the birth of Agni. The concluding fifth chapter offers a retrospective. Among other things it takes issue with idealistic interpreters of myth and symbol like Coomaraswamy, Sri Aurobindo, S. Freud and C. G. Jung. A detailed bibliography suitably concludes the work. It again shows the author's acquaintance with secondary literature and in particular with ancient Near Eastern, Greek and Roman parallels. In the indexes we find a somewhat fragmentary subject index. By contrast the indexes of authors and citations, commendably indicating also the footnotes, are exemplary. It is desirable that this exciting and profound work have a new edition without delay. A few improvements and additions, which the reviewer regards as desirable, could be made. On the whole the author should more clearly present his methods and the achieved results to the reader — the present review has already tried here to give some help. In particular it is to be noted, however, that the author's work was prepared in the years 1972—75 and has not been updated on all points. Thus progress made in research since then could be covered in a new edition to the reader's great advantage. The ground-breaking dissertation of H. Krick, 'Das Ritual der Feuergrundung' (Vienna, 1982), demands first attention. This should definitely be consulted for the significance of the Saddhotr- and Saptahotr-formulae. For obvious reasons, F. Staal's monumental work 'Agni' (Berkeley, 1983) should be consulted now for the ritual Agnicayana in addition to J. Eggeling's exposition. J. Gonda's monograph 'Prajàpati's Rise to Higher Rank' (Oriéntala Rheno-Traiectina 29, 1986) contains new material on the role and development of Prajàpati. The fundamental significance of the Indus culture for India's cultural history, variously emphasised by Bhattacharya, has recently been called into question with interesting arguments by D. Srinivasan. The relevant works from the GDR, as well as the structural analysis of RV-myths by B. Oguibenine (Paris) have evidently not been considered by the author. These desired additions concern principally the accumulation of data. By contrast, we fully approve, as noted at the outset, the</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW 329 scientific conception on which the work is based, and most of the judgements and conclusions presented before us. The author has been able to bring together new aspects of an important domain of Vedic mythology. We are glad to greet in him a worthy descendant of his renowned father, Durgamohan Bhattacharya.
