<plain_text><page sequence="1">Writing A Self: From Aurore Dudevant to George Sand Kathryn J, Crecelius Massachusetts Institute of Technology Aurore Dupin Dudevant, later George Sand, began writing in 1827 at age twenty-three at the request of her convent friend Jane Bazouin. None of Sand's earliest attempts at self-expression was published during her lifetime, although she seems to have reread many of them in her later years; most are now available, thanks in large part to Georges Lubin's indefatigable efforts in the Pleiade edition of the Oeuvres autobiographiques. Of the rest, La Marraine remains unpublished, and Aimee, the novel Aurore Dudevant brought to Paris to begin her literary career, was destroyed by her after her mentor, Hyacinthe de Latouche, termed it "detestable."1 The texts written by Aurore Dudevant are essentially exploratory, resem? bling exercises in style, composition and characterization. Several, like "Les Couperies" or "Une Lettre de femme," are fragmentary sketches that never became part of a whole work, whereas others, more complete, show the narrative skill of the future George Sand. In the more than half a dozen works Aurore Dudevant wrote between 1827 and 1831, there is an alterna? tion between autobiography, the novice writers logical source of inspiration, and fiction, as she sought to find her own voice and to attain a comfortable authorial stance. It is a privilege to have access to an authors first composi? tions, for they are very revealing. My purpose in analyzing Aurore Dude- vant's early texts is to study her development as a writer and to chart her evolution from Aurore Dudevant to George Sand. Aurore Dudevant s first literary effort was the delightful "Voyage au Mont d'Or" (known later as the "Voyage en Auvergne").2 Written in the form of a journal during her stay at a bathing establishment, the "Voyage" reveals a talent for humor, dialogue and characterization, as well as the descriptive style for which George Sand was famous. The "Voyage" was probably written with a real reader in mind, and was later sent to a friend, most likely Felicie Molliet. Yet it is an intensely personal work, one which reveals much sadness, doubt and searching. The opening pages contain an inordinate number of rhetorical questions of the following sort: "Que suis-je venue faire ici?", "Mais aujourd'hui que faire?", 47</page><page sequence="2">and eventually, "[S]i j'ecrivais a quelqu'un?" {Oa II, 503-04). It is significant that this first work should devote considerable space to the act of writing itself, as well as to Aurore Dudevant's domestic unhappiness, for her career as an author was to spring directly from her resolve to change her household arrangements by living part of the year away from her husband and her subsequent need to earn a living. She begins her journal by explaining her motivation for writing? boredom and ill-humor?and proceeds to choose a destinataire as well as a form. She first composes a letter to her mother, a cri du coeur expressing all the hurt her mother had inflicted upon her, but then rejects this option because it would cause her mother needless pain. Next, she casts about for other possible correspondents among her male and female friends, but finds none to be the ideal reader. She refuses to describe Clermont-Ferrand to her brother; "leternelle relation obligee" (Oa II, 505) is not the subject matter she has in mind. She comes to realize that her journal is a form of writing, but decides that it is more reflections or meditations than literature. This preliminary consideration of writing is interrupted by a dialogue with M. Garrick, a naturalist, followed by a description of the baths, which she tours with him. Two hours remain before dinner, and Aurore decides to while them away and quiet her chagrin by writing her memoirs, which she entitles Memoir es inedits. After the false starts of the previous pages, she has finally found the perfect destinataire in herself, as well as the proper form. Her Memoires inedits detail all the steps necessary for the production of a literary text, from the motivation for writing?"[l]es pensees d'hier feront diversion a celles d aujourd'hui"?to the choice of genre?memoirs are "un genre a la portee de tous"?and even to the structure of the work: "Ferai-je une preface? Oui. II en faut une" (Oa II, 507). She also includes the correction of the text and the redaction of a letter to a possible editor. Although summary and tongue-in-cheek, this mini-autobiography shows a literary awareness and authority in Aurore Dudevant that would develop over the following months and years into George Sands ability to write unceasingly and in several different genres. In addition, the reader familiar with Histoire de ma vie will find these lighthearted Memoires inedits uncanny, for they contain in drastically reduced form the outline of the later work. The gay, playful tone of the "Voyage au Mont d'Or" reappears in La Marraine and Histoire du reveur, Aurore Dudevant's next two literary pro? ductions, as does her preoccupation with the act of writing itself. Both were written for Jane Bazouin and contain similar dedicatory epistles, along with the tragi-comic tale of a pet cricket.3 Neither text was published during Sand's lifetime, and both manuscripts, written in notebooks, contain other, disparate texts. 48</page><page sequence="3">La Marraine is the name given to the notebook that includes Aurore Dudevant's first attempt at writing a novel, which is not surprisingly called Memoires dun villageois. The manuscript does not begin with the novel, however, but with the letter to Jane, the story of the cricket, part of a recipe for plum pudding and word games. The opening letter, presumably a re? sponse to Jane's request for a work from Aurore's pen, contains several interesting references to literature and writing. In describing her attempts to fulfill Jane's mandate, Aurore again shows a concern with the material side of the writers craft: "Que me manquait-il en effet? J'avais du papier du Havre excellente qualite, des plumes d'oie qui ecrivaient d'elles-memes, et de l'encre peut-etre plus noire que celle qui servait a Montaigne" (C I, 563; M 2). She humorously recounts the difficulties she had with structuring in a socially acceptable manner the first work she devised, which has disappeared without a trace, if it ever existed: J'avais commence par faire descendre mes heros dans la tombe au milieu des larmes de leurs proches. Ce tableau etant le plus touchant et le plus pathetique je n'avais pu resister a la tentation de le tracer le premier. Puis j'avais donne une famille a ces interessants personnages, mais sans songer a les conduire a l'autei prealablement, de sorte qu'un ami a qui je tracais la peinture de leur menage, crut de bonne foi que je voulais introduire une nouvelle morale fort differente de celle observee jusqu'ici. II se recria sur la hardiesse de l'innovation. Je me hatai de conclure l'hymen de mes amants, et cela me faisant penser que je n'avais point encore songe a les mettre au monde, je trouvai que plus j'avancais plus il me restait a faire. (C I, 563-64) (I began by sending my heroes to the grave amidst the tears of their relatives. Since this scene was the most touching and the most pathetic, I couldn't resist the temptation to paint it first. Then I gave children to these interesting characters, but without thinking to send them to the altar first, so that a friend to whom I described their family situation thought in good faith that I wanted to introduce a moral code very different from that observed until now. He criticized the boldness of the innovation. I hastened to conclude the marriage of my lovers; this made me realize that I hadn't yet thought to describe their birth, so that I found that the more I advanced in my work, the more there was left to do.) This brief summary of her (perhaps imaginary) novel, however ironically meant, is not dissimilar to the unouvelle morale11 of Indiana (1832). This letter goes on to admit that Aurore's literary baggage is skimpy, consisting as it does of a recipe for plum pudding and a laundress's bill, as well as a song that nearly got her hanged, thereby ending her career as a poet. Aussi Dieu me garde de jamais me lancer dans le domaine de la poesie, dussent tous les lauriers du Pinde couronner mon front, dusse*je etre appelee la muse de mon departe- ment, titre si envie par toute femme de province qui sait lire passablement dans les 49</page><page sequence="4">Heures de son diocese et qui peut ecrire un billet d'invitation sans faire plus de trois fautes d'orthographe. (C I, 563) (Thus let God preserve me from ever entering the domain of poetry, even if all of Pindar's laurels should cover my brow, even if I were to be called the muse of my departement, a title envied by any woman of the provinces who can read passably the Hours of her diocese and who can write an invitation without making more than three spelling mistakes.) This disclaimer to fame and literary glory manifests a sure knowledge of the kind of provincial society Sand would later satirize in many of her novels, and also hints that whatever her writing might lead to, the last position to which Aurore Dudevant aspires is that of provincial authoress, queen of the semi-literates of her region. After these preliminaries, the Memoires dun villageois begins. These turn out to be the story of Julien, a country boy whose father, a weaver, is struck by lightning in the second chapter of the novel. The marraine of the manu? script's title is Louise, daughter of the lord of the village chateau and eight years older than Julien. She sees to Julien's future after his father's death. There is no explanation of the dual titles of the notebook and the novel itself; the author seems undecided as to the real subject of her story. Julien and Louise represent two plot possibilities, as well as the two social classes that Sand would later treat. In theme, the work anticipates Valentine although in the later novel it is the heiress to the manor whom the young peasant loves. The Memoires is a rambling novel whose thirty-six chapters contain several references to Montaigne, one of Aurore Dudevant's favorite authors at the time, and to Tristram Shandy; Chapter 24 begins: "Si vous etes presse, sautez ce chapitre." Julien's first-person narrative gives way abruptly in the last chapter to a third-person narrative that marries Julien off to Blanche, his godmother's adopted child, and describes Louise's elopement to South America with a Spaniard she loves. Nothing in the preceding pages has prepared for this denouement, and one has the sense that Aurore, unable or unwilling to continue with the plot she had developed, ended her story in the most conventionally novelist ic way she could imagine. The Memoires is the work of an author already able to create characters and evoke sites. Julien, M. Lesec, the cure (a true George Sand character, kind and not the least bit hypocritical) are well-drawn, as is the village where they live. Although Aurore Dudevant is on her way to mastering these skills, narration and plot are her weak points. Her narrative voice did not affirm itself until after the publication of Indiana, while a tendency towards extravagant plot devices remained in her fiction, albeit in a more moderate form. 50</page><page sequence="5">As in Aurore Dudevant's other early texts, the narration of the Memoires is even more remarkable than the story they tell. Julien's novel, as has been noted, is part of a larger project called La Marraine, and is introduced because the narrator, after her letter to Jane and the tale of the cricket, is short on inspiration. She hopes that Julien will share his ideas and read the memoirs he has written at her urging; thus, Julien's work is a reflection, a kind of mise-en-abyme, of that of Aurore Dudevant who undertook Lm Marraine at Jane's insistence. Julien is not allowed to proceed smoothly with the reading of his memoirs, however, for in addition to interruptions from the cook, there is a discussion of the shades of meaning between memoires, Julien's first title, and souvenirs, his second, and a consideration of the value of publishing his manuscript, before he can finally get on with his story. Julien's dual title echoes Aurore Dudevant's two titles, while the ensuing discussion shows her awareness of the importance of the title for the prospective audience: "II est important qu'ils comprennent avant d ecouter de quoi il va etre question" (M, 29). The mention of publication, too, is significant, for it shows that Aurore is clearly contemplating writing for a public wider than one friend, even if ultimate publication is recommended here only for the author's very few intimates and not the world at large. Once these questions have been resolved and Julien has been given the floor, the narrator continues to interrupt, providing an editorial note and approbatory interventions. It is as though Aurore Dudevant, having chosen to write a novel with a male narrator, cannot allow him complete narrative freedom, but must constantly assert her own voice and her own control over the narrative. Why she decided to compose the memoirs of a man rather than those of a woman is a mystery. What is apparent, though, is her uncertainty over her own narrative authority. Aurore obviously felt that a male narrator was preferable, but she could not totally give up the power she had had in the first pages of La Marraine. This conflict over narrative authority and voice remains in Aurore Dudevant's early works, and is paradoxically resolved after the publication of Indiana when she achieves narrative confidence by using an exclusively male narrator. In the months following the composition of La Marraine, Aurore Dude? vant wrote her first short story. "Histoire du reveur" is a conte fantastique, the tale of a traveller's mysterious adventures on Mt. Etna, which turn out in the end to have been merely a dream. "Histoire du reveur" is a fast-paced, poetically written supernatural tale that in composition and execution is vastly superior to anything Aurora Dudevant had written until then. It is a satisfying tale of what Todorov calls the "fantastique-etrange," where at the end a reasonable explanation of a supernatural phenomenon is furnished.4 In fact, it is a fine example of the genre, worthy of such contemporaries as 51</page><page sequence="6">Nodier or Hoffman who combined music and the fantastic in much the same way as Aurore Dudevant does here. Histoire du reveur is a framed narrative whose first-person narrator, a woman, is in conversation with a certain Tricket, a magician.5 He narrates the story proper in the third person. These narrators appear in the begin? ning, again briefly in the first chapter, and finally at the end. Their narrative is divided into four chapters. In the first, called "La Grotte des chevres," an unknown voyager heads toward the summit of Mt. Etna to see the sunrise and all Sicily spread out before him in the light of dawn. He refuses the help of a guide, which causes the innkeeper to warn him against malignant spirits and an evil genie. The hero rejects these warnings and continues on his route. Unable to sleep at his campsite, known as la grotte des chevres, he sees a frightening visage on the other side of the fire which he soon recognizes as that of his mule. In the moonlight, he decides to press on to the summit. In "Le Chanteur," we learn that Amedee is the traveller's name. Music, one of George Sand's most enduring themes, makes its appearance in the form of a song heard through the forest. Amedee recognizes that the voice belongs to a trained musician, but cannot decide whether the singer is a man or a woman. The song too is unusual: an invocation to Etna's spirits, it is "une poesie enthousiaste et sauvage qui portait le caractere de l'improvisa- tion."6 Amedee answers with a song of his own, and soon meets the singer whose appearance is as sexually indeterminate as his voice. The singer mounts Amedee's mule which promptly bolts down the mountain like an animal possessed. Amedee tries to shake his companion, who behaves like the Erlking or some other demon (in his song he had evoked Hecate, goddess of the underworld) and whose frail, girlish body suddenly shows supernatural strength. Part Two ends with the mule throwing himself and his riders down a ravine. Part Three, "L'Eruption," finds the two men on the summit and Amedee doubting his sanity. The singer denies that there had been any fall, insisting that the rarified atmosphere caused delirium. When they reach the edge of the volcano, the young man reveals himself to be a spirit and calls Etna his king. Amedee demands to join him in the seething crater. As lava flows around them, he sees his companion transformed into a woman. He follows her into the volcano, but when he kisses her he receives an electric shock and awakens in the very brief fourth chapter to discover himself on his bed of leaves at the grotte des chevres. In addition to the theme of music, "Histoire du reveur" contains several suggestive images that link it to Sand's later texts. The most compelling is that of the androgyne. The singer has a voice described as "un melange de ce qu'il y a de plus harmonieux dans les facultes musicales de chaque sexe..." (Hr, 13). Amedee himself has an ambiguous name, for although it is a man's 52</page><page sequence="7">name, it ends in the feminine double e. His name serves to reinforce the musical theme by its association with Mozart and E.T.A. Hoffmann. The changing sex of the singer is linked to Amedee s desire to be a pure spirit, free of his body, for it is only as the lava burns away Amedee's body that the singer becomes a passionate woman. One senses that Amedee's disembodiment symbolizes Aurore Dudevant's dissatisfactions with the constraints of her own life and the restrictions occasioned by her gender, marital status, even sexual desires. Amedee cries out: "Ne me laisse pas vegeter dans cette vie reelle, a laquelle tu sembles ne pas appartenir" (Hr, 17), and exhibits a certain desperation that demands any sort of relief, no matter how drastic: "[A]nge ou demon: entraine-moi dans ce tourbillon que je vois deja t'en- velopper" (Hr, 17).7 In fact, Amedee does not seem frightened, although the images of the last pages are potentially terrifying: as the volcano erupts, he sees "le cratere vomissant des torrents de feu liquide. . . et lancant dans les nuages des bombes volcaniques dont la detonation etait assourdissante (Hr, 18). He is even able to look upon his half-consumed body without regret, and to appreciate the flames which incinerated him: "[P]ur esprit, il eprouvait l'ardeur de la flamme, non comme une douleur cuisante, mais comme une indicible volupte" (Hr, 18). Amedee hopes that this purification by fire will allow him access to higher pleasures both physical and spiritual, as well as freedom, and will afford him perfect union and harmony, for he and the woman seem simultaneously ethereal and corporeal. Yet the harmony suggested by the musical theme, and by the chromatic scale of the third part in which the colors red, white and blue dominate, is unattainable. His attempt at union, in the form of a kiss, separates him from the woman and awakens him from his dream. Although "Histoire du reveur" ends in defeat, Aurore Dudevant's dream did not, for she was soon to obtain her freedom. This story helped her to express her unhappiness and explore her innermost desires, while it enabled her to affirm her emerging identity as a writer and perfect the craft that would support her liberation. Eventually she did achieve harmony in her own life as George Sand. Perfect union, however, remained an elusive goal. The notebook containing "Histoire du reveur" also includes a second part, comprised of an Avis warning the reader about the narrator's discursive style and forming a link between the first part and the promised but never delivered continuation of Amedee's story, plus "Le Grillon" and "Les Confes? sions."8 Tricket is still her interlocutor, and in "Le Grillon" she again utilizes the device of the frame. This is essentially the same text that appears in La Marraine after the opening letter to Jane Bazouin, and in both versions it is not set off from the letter in any way. The story itself is a charming tale of a pet cricket that lived in her bookcase and serenaded her at midnight. Unfortunately, the cricket is crushed in the window by a careless chamber- 53</page><page sequence="8">maid causing his friend great chagrin. The episode is a sketch, rather than a short story, and is well-executed. The narration presents even more interest than the tale itself, though, for it concerns the act of telling a story, and shows Aurore Dudevant's growing literary consciousness. The narrator offers to read her tale to Tricket in the form of a long letter to Jane. This letter is quite similar to the one found in La Marraine, but there are a few notable exceptions: the laundress's bill has become a birthday compliment, and to the material conditions necessary for writing has been added a very significant one: money. J'oubliais le besoin d'argent, si c'est un stimulant utile, comme je n'en doute pas. La premiere fois que jecrirai pour le public, je ferai des merveilles certainement, car je ne connais personne qui puisse s'aider comme moi de cette disposition a l'enthousiasme qui consiste a n'avoir pas le sou (Hr, 20). (I forgot the need for money, and what a useful stimulus it is, as I don't doubt. The first time I write for the public, I will certainly write wonderful things, for I know no one who can be as encouraged as much as I by the disposition towards enthusiasm which comes from not having a penny to one's name.) As she wrote in her notebook, Aurore Dudevant was probably thinking more about using her pen to earn her living than of pleasing Jane. This letter is much longer than its prototype in La Marraine, for there are constant interruptions and digressions in the manner of Sterne, who is mentioned by name and undoubtedly alluded to in the description of the backwards novel that begins with the deaths of the protagonists but never quite reaches their births. Thus do La Marraine and "Histoire du reveur" contain the same texts, somewhat altered and embellished. It is obvious that Aurore Dudevant, even at this early stage, was not writing idly to fill time and paper, but was seriously developing her art, revising, rewriting and reworking to achieve the best effect. The manuscript of La Marraine is very clean and is obviously a final copy, not a draft, although it does contain one peculiarity, two versions of a brief scene, as though she could not choose between them and decided to keep both. The manuscript of "Histoire du reveur" presents an even more interesting case, for there are three extant manuscripts, all incomplete.9 This manuscript demonstrates that Aurore Dudevant rewrote and recopied her texts carefully and that she was already conscious of herself on some level as an author, even if publication was still some time away. The greater personal and narrative self-confidence achieved by Aurore Dudevant through these emendations is evident in the text that follows "Le Grillon." "Les Confessions" is constructed in a circular fashion: the narrator begins by speaking of her intention to write her memoirs, describes the kind 54</page><page sequence="9">of memoirs popular at the time and gives her view of what memoirs should be like. This discussion of autobiography reminds her of a previous conversa? tion with another friend, "Le Bel Esprit," about Jean-Jacques Rousseau. That exchange had been interrupted by the friend's loss of a tie pin and the fruitless search to locate it, which is recounted in a burlesque manner with mordant descriptions both of the starched necktie and an old servant's attempts to find the pin. In explaining to Tricket why she is happy about this contretemps, which prevented her friend from destroying her admiration for Rousseau, she proceeds to give a brief, autobiographical summary of the three stages her character has gone through in her lifetime. In so doing, she writes the memoirs that earlier she had stated she no longer wanted to write, thereby coming full-circle. Like the "Voyage au Mont d'Or," "Les Confessions" foreshadows Histoire de ma vie. Aurore Dudevant's memoirs are written with reference to Rousseau's Confessions. Sand's real autobiography would also be placed under Rous? seau's sign, although in the intervening years Aurore Dudevant's enthusiasm for Rousseau had been tempered by her own experience of notoriety. George Sand's criticism of Rousseau in Histoire de ma vie takes him to task for admitting to crimes or faults that are neither edifying nor helpful to the reader, as well as for revealing the turpitudes of his friends along with his own. She finds that his self-accusation demeans him, and stems not from humility, but pride. Although these opinions may derive in part from Sand's desire to avoid confessing to her own wrongs (her romantic life is heavily censored), and may be due to self-justification as well as conviction, it is nonetheless noteworthy that the same charge of pride is made in "Les Confessions" by "Le Bel Esprit," her philosophical interlocutor. In Histoire de ma vie, the views of Rousseau attributed in the earlier text to two different interlocutors have been synthesized and assumed by Sand as her own. The years intervening between the two texts enabled her to express confidently and in her own name her judgment of an author who in many ways was her mentor, but for whom she did not feel unreserved admiration. Aurore Dudevant's definition of memoirs in "Les Confessions" also resem? bles the rationale Sand gives years later for writing Histoire de ma vie: autobiography should be instructive to the reader, providing insight into the human heart that enables others to compare their own actions and moti? vations with those of the autobiographer. Both aims closely follow Rous? seau's, although her program is less systematic than his: where Rousseau seeks to write the first text for a course of study on human character, Aurore Dudevant/Sand hopes to interest and perhaps help the reader. Aurore Dudevant, and later Sand, does not insist on her uniqueness, as does Rousseau; rather, she is simply an example of the human condition, her story a true one sincerely told. Her vocabulary in "Les Confessions," with its 55</page><page sequence="10">insistence on veracity and frankness, as well as on the value of memoirs for comparative purposes, repeats Rousseau's, while her treatment of her subject parallels his. "Les Confessions" records Aurore Dudevant's moral evolution from de? pendence on outside authority to confidence in the penchants of her own heart, whatever the social costs. She describes her journey from passivity in the face of ethical and philosophical problems to fanatical partisanship, although in both cases her opinions were derived from others. Her final, and she hopes permanent, stage, was achieved by self-examination rather than by the study of the writings of famous thinkers, and it represents the triumph of feeling and instinct over reason and systems. Aurore Dudevant's growing self-reliance, confidence in her own views and liberation from the "anxiety of influence," as well as her imperviousness to her critics are stated clearly in a text that in all likelihood precedes by a very short time her final break with her husband Casimir and her past. In the early months of 1831 Aurore Dudevant moved to Paris and increased dramatically her literary production. In April or May she wrote "Jehan Cauvin," another framed narrative that was not published during her lifetime. "Jehan Cauvin" is the last text written by Aurore Dudevant, for her next literary works would be signed with the temporary pseudonym J. Sand that Hyacinthe de Latouche devised for her and Jules Sandeau. The works written by Aurore Dudevant share many common charac? teristics. All, except the "Voyage au Mont d'Or," more or less take the form of framed narratives. In "Histoire du reveur," the frame is distracting and detracts from an otherwise unified third-person narrative. The frame in the other texts, however, is of more interest to the student of the budding George Sand than to the reader seeking diversion, for the story-within-the- story is generally the fictional nub of the piece. The frames and digressions are reminiscent of eighteenth-century liter? ature, particularly Sterne's and Diderot's. Both "Le Grillon" and "Les Con? fessions," in their circuitous narration and deferred conclusions, recall Jacques le fataliste, where Jacques' lovelife somehow never gets recounted. Frames are also commonly used by authors of moral tales and fairy tales, genres familiar to Aurore Dudevant. She expressly makes reference to the latter by making Tricket a magician and by inventing a fantastic story. In addition, "Histoire du reveur" begins with the notation "2de nuit" (Hr, 9), which not only implies the existence of a first night, now lost if indeed it was ever written, but more importantly, would seem to be a reference to the Mille et une nuits and Scheherazade's storytelling. The choice of the cricket as a subject is also significant, for fairy tales are full of benign, anthropomorphic animal friends just like Aurore's.10 Writing for herself, or for her friends, discontinuously and in moments snatched from other pursuits, Aurore 56</page><page sequence="11">Dudevant drew on her experience of reading to provide her with models of narration. The frame is especially useful to the novice writer, for it confers authority on the narrator, and makes explicit the origin of the narrative voice. The assumption of responsibility for the narrative by a credible narrator was Aurore Dudevant's greatest difficulty in her early texts, as it was George Sand's. In the "Voyage au Mont d'Or," "Le Grillon" and "Les Confessions," the narrator is a young woman closely identifiable with Aurore Dudevant herself, while the Memoires d}un villageois and "Histoire du reveur," the least autobiographical of Aurore Dudevant's writings, are narrated by a man. In "Jehan Cauvin," the androgynous narrator cannot choose between a single je or a more general nous. This uncertain nous reappears in Rose et Blanche, as well as Indiana; in addition, Indiana is narrated by a masculine je who is only identified in the conclusion. In any event, after "Les Confessions," Aurore Dudevant would never again permit herself to use a female narrator, prefer? ring to adopt a male voice along with a male name. Her first works show that the use of a male voice did not come automatically or easily, and that Aurore Dudevant struggled well before publication became a reality with the issue of authority, so crucial to every writer, but especially to the woman writer. The multi-layered, framed form had other advantages as well, for it allowed Aurore Dudevant to pick up or drop a subject, continue or end a story as she wished, as well as to mix genres, for the truly fictional occupies only part of these texts. Aurore Dudevant's early works are autobiographical not only in that they draw in an unmediated fashion on her own life for their subject matter, as is expected in an inexperienced writer, but more impor? tantly because they deliberately thematize the autobiographical impulse. Aurore Dudevant's two memoirs show a woman in search of herself, trying to make sense of her life and to find a direction that will make her happy. The comparison of the "Voyage" with "Les Confessions" is instructive, for the later text shows that Aurore Dudevant has made a clear moral progression from the uncertainty and suicidal despair of the "Voyage" to a calmer psychological stance based on an acceptance of her own opinions over those of others, despite possible social sanctions. She is clearly ready to begin a new phase of her life. The presence of autobiography in Aurore Dudevant's early texts empha? sizes as much writing in general and its material conditions as it does the writing of her life story; this preoccupation is seen in the letters to Jane Bazouin as well. Aurore Dudevant can be said to be writing herself, both by using writing as a form of therapy in order to discover herself and to ease her pain, and by persuading herself that she can indeed write, that she possesses the tools, ability and motivation necessary to be an author. She owned the pens and paper, while her motivations ranged from boredom to financial 57</page><page sequence="12">necessity, to the pure desire to tell a story. Each completed text, along with Jane's pleased reactions, affirmed her identity and convinced her that she at least had potential, if not fully formed talent. From the very first, the artist in Aurore Dudevant was struggling to appear, was questioning her craft and measuring her own ideas against those of her predecessors or contemporaries. Once in Paris, she would continue to write, and would benefit from Latouche's comments as well as from the experience of working for Le Figaro and writing for the general public. Although none of her early work appeared in print and Aimee was burned, Aurore Dudevant nonetheless served a valuable four-year apprenticeship at Nohant, learning who she was and that she had something to say. NOTES George Sand, Oeuvres autobiographiques, Georges Lubin ed. (Paris: Pleiade, 1971), II, 151. References to this work will appear in the text as Oa. In this article, I have made the distinction between Aurore Dudevant, the young woman who was in the process of discovering her literary abilities, and George Sand, the author she became with the publication of Indiana in 1832. All translations are my own. 2Georges Lubin states in his introduction to the "Voyage" that the work was written in 1829, based on his dating of the letter which accompanied the manuscript. Aurore Dudevant's trip took place in 1827, and the opening date of Sunday 12 August could only refer to August 12, 1827. This fact, plus the spontaneous tone of the work, leads me to believe that it was written in 1827, although Aurore Dudevant may have recopied it and even made corrections in 1829; a letter from Jane Bazouin on October 12, 1827 indicates that Aurore had recently sent her three pages describing her trip. See Oa II, 499-501. 3Lubin treats this dedicatory missive as a letter. It can be found in George Sand, Correspon- dance, Georges Lubin, ed., 2nd. ed. (Paris: Gamier, 1964), 1,561-64.

References to this edition are cited in the text as Hr. 7The same angel-demon opposition appears in Lelia, where it is thought to have influenced Baudelaire's double postuhxdon. Here, the language itself can be said to be quite Baudelairean. Aurore Dudevant may have gotten her inspiration for this dichotomy from Byron. 8Thierry Bodin's new edition of "Histoire du reveur" contains two previously unpublished fragments of the story, neither of which is found in the most complete manuscript of the tale. Fragment A contains approximately two paragraphs detailing Amedee's reaction upon awaken? ing and his conversation with the innkeeper who had originally warned him of the presence of spirits on the mountain. It does not add anything to the story. Why Aurore Dudevant did not include this ending in her other copy of the manuscript cannot be said for certain, for she obviously anticipated continuing her narrative by writing "Chap. 4me de Phistoire du reveur" (Hr, 28). Perhaps she felt that the story was complete as written, and so eliminated as 58</page><page sequence="13">inadequate the sequel she had devised, while nonetheless leaving space for a better continua? tion, should she come up with one. Fragment B describes a musical soiree held by an Italian prince, where Amedee makes an episodic appearance. It is not in any way a continuation of "Histoire du reveur" as we now know it, and lacks a beginning. It does, however, anticipate "La Prima Donna" (1831), an Aurore Dudevant?Jules Sandeau product. 9See Thierry Bodin's edition of "Histoire du reveur" for details on the different manuscripts, as well as the variantes listed in his notes. 10Pierre Fauchery points out that women authors of the eighteenth century often wrote about small pet animals such as birds.
