This realization of the idea of the beautiful, to which symbolic art vainly strives to attain, is accomplished for the first time in Classic Art. We have already seen what is here to be understood by the Classic. Its characteristics are summed up in the ideal. This perfect mode of representation fulfills the condition which is the very end of art. But, in order that this condition might be accomplished, there was need of all the particular moments or elements which appear in symbolic art. For the basis of classic beauty is not a vague and obscure conception; it is the free idea, which is its own significance, and which, therefore, manifests itself on its own account ? in a word, it is spirit, which seizes itself as its own object. In thus presenting itself to itself as an object of contemplation, it assumes an external form ; and this, iden tical with the matter which it manifests, becomes its faithful, adequate expression. The consciousness which it possesses of itself permits it to reveal itself clearly. This is what Symbolic Art, with that species of unity which constitutes the symbol, has been able to present us. Now it is nature with its blind forces which forms the source of its rep resentations ; again, it is the spiritual Being which it conceives in a vague manner, and which it personifies in gross divinities. Between idea and form there is revealed a simple affinity, an external correspondence. The attempt to conciliate them, under their opposition, is still more striking; or art, as in Egypt, in wishing to give expression to spirit, creates only obscure enigmas. Above all, there is betrayed the absence of true personality and freedom ; for these can unfold only with the evolution of complete self-consciousness on the part of the spirit. We have, it is true, encountered this idea of the nature of spirit as opposed to the sensuous world, clearly expressed in the religion and the poetry of the Hebrew people. But that which is born of this opposition is not beauty; it is the sub lime. A lively sentiment of personality manifests itself also with the Arab race. But with them this is only a superficial</page><page sequence="3">Hegel on Classic Art. 147 side, stripped of depth and of generality ; it is not true person ality fixed upon a solid basis, upon the knowledge of spirit and of the moral nature. All these elements, therefore, whether separated or combined, cannot present us the ideal. They are antecedents, conditions, and materials. Their collective totality presents nothing which corresponds to the idea of real beauty. This ideal beauty we have found realized for the first time in Classic Art, which endeavors to give it a more precise characterization. I. In classic art, spirit does not appear under its infinite form. It is not the thought which thinks itself, the absolute which reveals itself to itself as the universal. It manifests itself still in an immediate, natural, and sensuous existence. But at least the idea, in so far as it is free, chooses for itself in art its appropriate form, and possesses within itself the prin ciple of its external manifestation. It must then return to nature, but only to become its master. Those forms which it borrows from nature, instead of being simply material, lose their independent value in order to become exclusively the expression of spirit. Such is the identification, con formable to spirit itself, of the two elements, spiritual and sensuous. In place of being neutralized the one by the other, the two elements rise to a higher harmony which consists in each being preserved in the other; in idealizing and spiritual izing nature. This unity is the basis of Classic Art. By virtue of this identification of significance with sensuous form, no separation can take place, and thus there is no inter ruption of their perfect union. Thus, too, the inner principle cannot retire into itself as pure spirit and abandon corporeal existence. Besides, as the objective and outer element in which spirit manifests itself is entirely definite and particular, the free spirit, such as art exhibits it, can only be the equally definite and independent spiritual individuality in its natural form. Hence man constitutes the true center of classic beauty. It is clear, also, that this intimate union of the spiritual with the sensuous element can be no other than the human form. For, though this participates especially in the animal type, it is none the less the sole manifestation of spirit. There is in</page><page sequence="4">148 The Jowmal of Speculative Philosophy. it the inanimate, the ugly; but the task of art is to cause to disappear from it this opposition between matter and spirit &gt; to embellish the body, to render this form more perfect, to animate it, to spiritualize it. As classic art represents free spirituality under the human, individual, and corporeal form, it has often been reproached with anthropomorphism. With the Greeks, Xenophanes had already attacked the popular religion in saying that, if lions had had sculptors among them, they would have given to their gods the form of lions. The French have in this sense a witty say ing, that " God created man in His image, and men have shown their appreciation by providing themselves with gods in human form." But it is to be remarked that, if classic beauty is, in one respect, imperfect when compared with the romantic ideal, the imperfection does not reside in anthropomorphism as such. Far from this, we must admit that, if Classic Art is sufficiently anthropomorphic for art, it is too little so relatively to a more advanced religion. Christianity has pushed anthro pomorphism much further; for, in the Christian doctrine, God is not merely a divine personification under the human form ; He is at once very God and very Man. He passed through every phase of human existence. He was born, He suffered, and died. In Classic Art, sensuous nature does not die, but neither is it resuscitated. Thus this religion does not wholly satisfy the human soul. The Greek ideal has for its basis an unchangeable harmony between spirit and sensuous form ? the unalterable serenity of the immortal gods; but this calm has about it something cold and inanimate. Classic Art has not comprehended the true essence of the divine nature, nor pene trated to the depths of the soul. It has not known how to develop its inmost powers in their opposition, and again to reestablish their harmony. All this phase of existence, the evil, the sinful, the unhappy, moral suffering, the revolt of the will, remorse, and the agonies of the soul, are unknown to it. Classic art does not pass beyond the proper domain of the veritable ideal. II. As to its realization in history, it is scarcely necessary to say that we must seek it among the Greeks. Classic beauty,</page><page sequence="5">Hegel on Classic Art. 149 with the infinite wealth of ideas and forms which compose its domain, has been allotted to the Greek people, and we ought to render homage to them for having raised art to its highest vitality. The Greeks, to consider their history only from the external side, lived in the happy medium of self-conscious, subjective freedom and moral substantiality. They were not enchained in the immobile unity of the Orient, of which the result is political and religious despotism, where the person ality of the individual is absorbed and annulled in the uni versal substance, and has thence neither rights nor moral character. On the other hand, they proceed no further than to that stage where man concentrates himself within himself; separates himself from society, and from the world which envi rons him, in order to live retired within himself. Hence they connect their conduct with real interests only in turning toward -a purely spiritual world. In the moral life of the Greek people the individual was, it is true, independent and free, yet without being able to isolate himself from the general interests of the State, or to separate his freedom from that of the city of which he formed a part. In Greek life the senti ment of general order as basis of morality remains in change less harmony with that of personal freedom. At the epoch when this principle reigned in all its purity, the opposition between political and moral law which is revealed by the moral consciousness was not yet manifest. The citi zens were still penetrated by the spirit which constitutes the basis of public customs. They sought their own freedom only in the triumph of the general interest. The sentiment of this happy harmony penetrates through all the productions in which Greek freedom has become conscious of itself. So that this epoch is the medium in which beauty begins its true life, and enters into full possession of its serene domain. It is the medium of free vitality ? which is not here merely a product of nature, but a creation of spirit ? and by this right it receives its manifestation in art; it is a mingling of spontaneity and reflection, where the individual is not iso lated, but where also he cannot connect his faith, his suffer ings, and his destiny with a more elevated principle, and</page><page sequence="6">150 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. knows not how to reestablish harmony within himself. This moment, like human life in general, was only a transition ; but in this instant, so brief, art attains to the culminating point of beauty under the form of plastic individuality. Its develop ment was so rich and so full of genius that all the colors, all the tones, are there combined. At the same time, it is true, all that has appeared in the past finds its place here no longer as something absolute and independent, but as elements which are subordinate and accessory. Whence, also, the Greek people has revealed to itself its own spirit, in a sensuous and visible manner, in its gods. It has given them in art a form perfectly in accord with the ideas which they represent. Thanks to this perfect accord, which reigns as well in Greek art as in Greek mythology, this was, in Greece, the highest expression of the absolute ; and the Greek religion is the very religion of art; while, at a later epoch, Romantic Art, though it may be as truly art, still gives intimation of a higher form of consciousness than Art is capable of representing. III. Art here appears, not as a production of nature, but as a creation of the individual spirit. It is the work of a free spirit which has consciousness of itself, which possesses itsell, which has nothing vague or obscure in thought, and finds itself arrested by no technical difficulty. This new position of the Greek artist is manifested at once in respect of matter, of form, and of technical ability. 1. In that which concerns the matter or the ideas which are to be represented ? in opposition to Symbolic Art, where the spirit gropes about, seeks, without being able to arrive at, a clear notion ? the artist here finds those ideas already pro vided in dogma, in popular faith ; and of these he renders a clear account to himself. Nevertheless, he is not subservient to it; he accepts it, but reproduces it freely. Greek artists received their subjects from the popular religion ; this was an idea originally transmitted by the Orient, but which was already transformed in the consciousness of the people. They transformed it, in their turn, in the sense of the beautiful; they reproduced and created at the same time. 2. But it is, above all, in the form, that their free activity is</page><page sequence="7">Hegel on Classic Art. 151 concentrated and exercised. While Symbolic Art exhausts itself in search of a thousand extraordinary forms in order to transmit its ideas, having neither measure nor fixed rule, the Greek artist confined himself within his subject and respected its limits. Thus he also established a perfect accord between matter and form. In thus working out the form, he perfected the matter, or content, also. He disengaged them both from useless accessories, so as to adapt the one to the other. Whence he did not pause with an immobile and traditional type; he perfected the whole, for matter and form are insep arable ; he developed both the one and the other in all the serenity of inspiration. 3. As to the technical element, to the classic artist belong, in the highest degree, ability combined with inspiration. Nothing either arrested or constrained him. Here were no impediments, as in a stationary religion where forms are con secrated by usage ? as, for example, in Egypt. And this ability continued always increasing. Progress in the methods of art is necessary to the realization of pure beauty, and to the perfect execution of works of genius. Division.?This must be sought only in the degrees of development which spring from the conception of the classic ideal. 1. The fundamental point which here constitutes all prog ress is the advent of genuine personality, which, in order to express itself, can no longer make use of forms borrowed from inorganic or animal nature, nor of gross personifications where the human form is mingled with preceding forms. This suc cessive transformation by which classic beauty is engendered of itself is, then, the first point to examine. 2. After having spanned this interval, we have attained to the true ideal of Classic Art. What constitutes here the cen tral point is the Greek Olympus, the new world of the gods of Greece, the beautiful creations of art. These we must characterize. 3. But in the idea of Classic Art is contained the principle of its destruction, which must conduct us into a mightier world?the Romantic world. This will constitute the subject of a third chapter.</page><page sequence="8">152 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. CHAPTER I.?Development of Classic Art. /. Degradation of the Animal Kingdom. 1. Sacrifices of Animals.?2. Hunts of Wild Beasts.?3. Metamorphoses". The first improvement consists in a reaction against the Symbolic Form, which the new spirit busies itself in destroy ing. The Greek gods came from the Orient; the Greeks bor rowed their divinities from foreign religions. We might say, on the contrary, that they invented them ; for invention does not exclude borrowing. They transformed ideas contained in ancient traditions. Now, upon what was this transformation based? This is the history of polytheism, and of antique art which pursues a parallel course and is inseparable from it. The Greek divinities are, first of all, moral persons clothed with the human form. The first development, then, consists in rejecting those gross symbols which, in Oriental naturalism, constitute the objects of worship, and which disfigure the representations of art. This progress is marked by the degra dation of the animal kingdom. It is clearly indicated in a great number of the ceremonies and fables of polytheism: 1. By Animal Sacrifices. 2. By Sacred Hunts; by many of the exploits attributed to heroes ? in particular, the Labors of Hercules. Some of the fables of JEsop have the same mean ing. 3d. The metamorphoses described by Ovid are also dis figured myths, or fables become burlesque, but of which the basis, remaining intact and easy to be recognized, contains the same idea. This is the opposite of the manner in which the Egyptians considered animals. Nature here, instead of being venerated and adored, is reduced and degraded. To assume an animal form is no longer a deification ? it is the chastisement of a monstrous crime. This form is made a disgrace to the gods themselves, and they assume it only to satisfy the passions of a sensual nature. Such is the meaning of many of the fables of Jupiter, as those of Danae, of Europa, of Leda, of Gany</page><page sequence="9">Hegel on Classic Art. 153 mede. The representation of the generative principle in nature, which constitutes the source of ancient mythologies, is here changed into a series of tales, wherein the father of gods and men plays a role little edifying and often ridiculous. Finally, all this part of religion which relates to the sensual desires of the animal nature is crowded into the background and repre sented by subordinate divinities: Circe, who changes men into swine, Pan, Silenus, the Satyrs, and the Fauns. Still the human form predominates, the animal form being indicated by the ears, small horns, etc. Among these mixed forms it is necessary also to class the Centaurs, in which the sensual, passionate side of nature dominates, and where the spiritual side permits itself to be suppressed. Chiron alone, an able physician and the pre ceptor of Achilles, has a noble character, but his subaltern functions of pedagogue, which do not rise above human ability and wisdom, prevent his admission to the circle of the gods. In this fashion the character which the animal form presents in Classic Art is found to be changed in all respects ; it is employed to designate the evil ? that which is in itself bad or reprehensible : the forms of nature inferior to spirit; while elsewhere it is the expression of the Good and of the Abso lute. II. Conflict Between the Old and the New Gods. 1. Oracles.?2. Distinction between the Ancient and the New Divinities.? 3. Overthrow of the Ancient Gods. After this degradation of the animal kingdom a progress of a higher order causes itself to be felt. It consists in this : that the real gods of Classic Art, of whom the essential characteristics are freedom and personality, manifest them selves with the attributes of consciousness and will as spiritual powers. And here it is under the human form that they appear. As the animal kingdom has been degraded and abased, so the powers of nature are also abased and degraded. In opposition to these, spirit occupies a more elevated rank.</page><page sequence="10">154 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. Then, instead of simple personification, it is true personality which constitutes the chief element. Still, the gods of Classic Art do not cease to be forces of nature, because God could not here be represented as the free and absolute Spirit ? such as he appears in Judaism and in Christianity. God is neither the creator nor the lord of nature ; nor is He any more the absolute being whose essence is spirituality. This contrast between the Divinity and created things deprived of the divine character gives place to a harmonious accord, wherein results beauty. The universal and the individual ? nature and spirit ? combine without losing their respective rights, and without altering their purity in the representations of Greek art. Classic Art does not, then, immediately attain to its ideal. Thus the manner in which these gross, deformed, bizarre ele ments borrowed from nature are modified and perfected ought especially to excite interest in Greek mythology. With out entering into the detail of traditions and myths (which is not our subject), we would call attention to the chief points in this progress, as follows : 1. The Oracles. 2. The distinction between the Old and the New Gods. 3. The overthrow of the Ancient Divinities. 1. In the oracles the phenomena of nature are no longer objects of adoration and of worship, as they are with the Per sians or the Egyptians. Here the gods themselves reveal their wisdom to man ; the very names lose their sacred char acter. The Oracle of Dodona makes response in this sense. The signs by which the gods manifest their will are very simple : the rustling and whispering of sacred oaks, the mur mur of fountains, the clang of brazen vessels which the wind causes to resound. So, also, at Delos rustled the laurel; and at Delphi the wind upon the brazen tripod was a distinct, defini tive element. But, beyond such immediate natural sounds, man himself was an enunciator of the oracle in so far as, out of the waking thoughtfulness of the understanding, he was dazed and frenzied into a naturalism of inspiration or ecstasy. Thus the Pythias renders oracles. Another characteristic is that the oracle is obscure and ambiguous. God, it is true, is</page><page sequence="11">Hegel on Classic Art. 155 considered as possessing a knowledge of the future ; but the form under which He reveals it remains vague, indefinite ; the idea needs to be interpreted, so that man who receives the response is obliged to explain it, to mingle his reason with it; and, if he thus takes part in the delivery of the oracle, he also assumes a part of the responsibility. In dramatic art, for ex ample, man does not yet act entirely on his own account; he consults the gods, and obeys their will; but his will is fused with theirs. A part is performed by his freedom. 2. The distinction between the old and the-new divinities marks still more clearly this progress of moral freedom. Among the first, which personify the powers of nature, there is already established a gradation : First, the savage and subterranean powers, Chaos, Tartarus, Erebus ; then, Uranus, Gsea, the Giants and Titans ; in a still higher degree, Prome theus, the friend of the new gods, the benefactor of man, afterward punished for this apparent benefit ? an inconsequence which is explained by the fact that, if Prometheus taught men industry, he created a cause of discord and dissension in not joining a higher instruction, namely, that of morality, the science of government, guarantees of property. Such is the profound meaning of this myth which Plato explains thus in his Protagoras. Another class of divinities, equally ancient but already moral, though they still recall the fatality of physical laws, are the Eumenides, Dice, the Erinyes. Here we see appear the ideas of right and of justice; but of right that is exclusive, absolute, narrow, unintelligent, under the form of an impla cable vengeance ; or, like the ancient Nemesis, of a power that brings down all that is elevated ; establishes equality by level ing? a procedure quite opposed to true justice. 3. Finally, this development of the Classic Ideal is revealed most clearly in the theogony and the genealogy of the gods ; in their birth and their succession; by the abasement of the divinities of earlier races; again, in the hostility which breaks out between them, in the revolution which has de prived them of sovereignty in order to place it in the hands of 1 1</page><page sequence="12">156 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. new divinities. The distinction is pronounced at the point where the conflict arises, and this conflict becomes the chief element of mythology. This is, indeed, the conflict between Nature and Spirit, and it is the law of the world. Under the historical form it is the perfecting of human nature, the successive conquest of the rights of property, the amelioration of laws, of the political constitution. In religious representations it is the triumph of moral divinities over the powers of nature. This conflict announces itself as the greatest catastrophe in the history of the world ; so that it is not the theme of a par ticular myth ; it is the principal, decisive fact which forms the center of all this mythology. The conclusion relative to the history of art, and to the de velopment of the ideal, is that art, like mythology, must reject, as unworthy of it, all that is confused, fantastic, ob scure ; all gross mingling of the natural with the spiritual. All these creations of an ill-regulated imagination no longer find their place here; they must vanish before the light of spirit. Art purifies itself from all that may be styled caprice, fantasy, symbolic accessory?from every vague and confused idea. At the same time the new gods form an organized and estab lished world. This unity is affirmed and perfected still further in the ulterior developments of plastic art and poetry. III. Conservation of the Ancient Elements in the New Myth ological Representations. 1. The Mysteries.?2. Conservation of the Ancient Divinities.?3. Physical Ele ments of the Ancient Gods. Notwithstanding the victory of the new gods, the ancient divinities preserve their place in Classic Art. They are ven erated in part under their primitive form, in part changed and modified. 1. The first form under which we find the ancient myths preserved among the Greeks is that of the Mysteries.</page><page sequence="13">Hegel on Classic Art. 157 The Greek mysteries possessed no secret, if by this word we understand that the Greeks did not know what was the basis of them. The greater part of the Athenians, together with a mul titude of foreigners, were initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries ; only they would not reveal what the initiation had taught them. Now, it does not appear that any very lofty secret was concealed in the mysteries, nor that their content was much more elevated than that of the public religion. They preserved the ancient traditions. The form was symbolic, as was appropriate to the ancient telluric, astronomic, and Titanic elements. In the sym bol, indeed, the meaning remains obscure ; it contains some thing else than what is revealed under the external form. The mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus have, it is true, a rational explanation, and hence a profound meaning; but, the form under which this matter was presented remaining foreign to it, nothing clear could arise from it. Thus the mysteries ex ercised little influence upon the development of art. For example, it is related of iEschylus that he had revealed de signedly the mysteries of Ceres. The impiety was restricted to having said that Artemis was the daughter of Ceres ; and this does not seem a very profound idea. 2. The worship and the conservation of the ancient gods appear more clearty in the artistic representations themselves. Thus Prometheus is first punished and chastised as a Titan; but, again, we see him delivered; permanent honors are ren dered him. He was venerated in the Academy, with Minerva, as Vulcan himself. According to Lysimachides, Vulcan and Prometheus were distinct; the latter was represented as prior and the more ancient. The two had a common altar upon the same pedestal. According to the myth, Prometheus was not long compelled to suffer his punishment, and was delivered from his chains by Hercules. We have another example in the Eumenides of JEschylus. The discussion between Apollo and the Eumenides is judged by the Areopagus, presided over by Minerva?that is to say, by the living spirit of the Athenian people. The voices are equally divided; the white stone of Minerva terminates the dispute. The angry Eumenides raise</page><page sequence="14">158 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. an outcry; but Pallas appeases them by according to them divine honors in the sacred wood of Colonus. 3. The ancient go'ds do not merely preserve their place beside the new; what imports most, even in the new gods, is the preserved ancient element which belongs to nature. As it is very easily conciliated with the spiritual individuality of the Classic Ideal, it is reflected in them, and its worship is thus found to be perpetuated. The Greek gods, notwithstanding this human form, are not, then, as has. often been said, simple allegories of the elements of nature. They say truly that Apollo is the god of the sun ; Diana, the goddess of the moon; Neptune, the god of the sea; but the separation of the two terms (the physical ele ment and its personification), as in the divine government of the world in the sense of the Bible, cannot apply to Greek Mythology. Moreover, the Greeks did not deify the objects of nature; they thought, on the contrary, that nature is not divine. To deify the existences of nature is the characteristic of the earlier myths. Thus, in the Egyptian religion, Isis and Osiris represent the sun and moon. But Plutarch thinks it would be unworthy to wish to explain them in this way. But all that in the sun, in the earth, etc., is ill-regulated or in disorder is, with the Greeks, attributed to physical forces. The Good ? order and regularity ? these are the work of the gods. The essence of the gods is the spiritual side ? reason ? the x&lt;V&lt;&gt;7, the principle of law or of order. With this mode of viewing the spiritual nature of the gods, the particular ele ments of nature are distinguished from the new gods. We have the habit of associating the sun with Apollo ; the moon with Diana. But with Homer these divinities are independent of the stars which they represent. Still there remains in the new gods an echo of the powers of nature. We have already seen the principle of this com bination of the spiritual with the natural in the Classic Ideal; to illustrate which a few examples will here suffice : Neptune represents the sea, the ocean, of which the waves embrace the earth ; but his power and his activity extend still further. It</page><page sequence="15">Hegel on Classic Art. 159 ivas he who built the walls of Ilium ; he was a tutelary divin ity of Athens. Apollo, the new god, is the light of science, the god who renders oracles ; he preserves, nevertheless, an analogy with the sun and with physical light. It is disputed whether Apollo ought or ought not to signify the sun. He is at once both the sun and not the sun, for he is not limited to this merely material significance, but has come to have a mean ing which is truly spiritual. There is a real and profound analogy between intellectual light and the light which renders bodies visible. Thus, in Apollo as god of intelligence, we find also an allusion to the light of the sun. Similarly his deadly arrows have a symbolic relation to the rays of that luminary. Hence, in external representation, there must be a clear indi cation of the outer attributes which show in which sense the divinity is to be taken. In the history of the birth of the new gods we recognize the natural element which the gods of the Classic Ideal preserve. Thus, in Jupiter, there are characteristics which indicate the sun ; the twelve Labors of Hercules have a relation to the sun and to the months of the year. By her numerous breasts the Diana of Ephesus expresses fecundity. On the contrary, in Artemis the huntress, who slays ferocious beasts, with her beautiful human form ?that of a young girl ? the physical side is concealed; though the crescent, together with the arrows, still recalls the moon. It is the same with Venus Aphrodite ; the further we ascend toward her origin in Asia, the more she is a power of nature. When she arrives in Greece, properly speaking, there appears the side more spiritual and more in dividual, of the beauty of the body, of grace, of love, which is added to the physical and sensuous side. The muses origin ally represented the murmur of fountains.? Jupiter himself is first adored as thunder, though in Homer the lightning flash is already a sign of his will; it is an omen, a connection with intelligence. Juno also presents a reflex of nature ; she re calls the celestial vault, and the atmosphere in which the gods move. Similarly with the forms of the animal kingdom. Hereto fore degraded, they resume a positive place. But the sym 1 1 #</page><page sequence="16">160 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. bolic sense is lost; the animal form has no right to mingle with the human form ?a monstrous mixture which art rejects. It presents itself then as a simple attribute or indicative sign : the Eagle near Jupiter, the Peacock by the side of Juno; Doves accompany Venus; the dog Anubis becomes the guardian of the lower world. If, then, there is still something symbolic contained in the ideal of the Greek gods, the primitive sense is no longer apparent; the physical side, heretofore the essen tial, no longer remains, except as a vestige or external pecul iarity. Further, the essence of these divinities being human nature, the purely external side appears no longer, except as a thing accidental ? a human passion or foible. Such are the amours of Jupiter, which primarily related to the generative force of nature, and which, having lost their symbolic mean ing, assume the character of licentious stories, which the poets have invented at will. This realization of the gods as moral persons conducts us to the Ideal of Classic Art, properly speaking.</page></plain_text>
