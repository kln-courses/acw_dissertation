<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth By Teresa Bolger INTRODUCTION An archaeological excavation was carried out at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda (townland: Moneymore; NGR: 30880, 27515) in August 2002 and September/October 2002, in association with the re-development of the site. Though a number of archaeological excavations have been carried out in many areas of Drogheda, such as Shop Street and Dyer Street, investigations along West Street have been very limited. A significant number of the buildings presently fronting the street have basements dating from the eighteenth century onwards, reducing the potential for archaeological material to survive. The site was previously occupied by a pair of eighteenth-century houses (nos 24 and 25) which had been unified for use as commercial premises. Only one house had a basement. The excava tion area measured 10.50m by 4m, approximating the footprint of no. 24 West Street. No archaeo logical material survived in the remainder of the site, as it was truncated by the insertion of a basement during the construction of no. 25. The evidence from the excavation indicates the existence of seven broad phases of activity at the site, ranging from the medieval period to modern times. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The site is located at the corner of West Street and Stockwell Lane in Drogheda, on the north side of the River Boyne. The town of Drogheda was founded by Hugh de Lacy, who had been granted the lands of Meath by Richard FitzGilbert de Clare (Strongbow). The town was founded as two distinct boroughs on either side of the river and each borough had its own charter, with independent privileges and corporations, until 1412, when both boroughs merged to form a single town. The medieval walled town of Drogheda encompassed the settlements on both sides of the Boyne and was one of the largest such towns in Ireland. The present street pattern on the north side of the town is of medieval origin, with many of the main thoroughfares and laneways dating back to that period. It may be inferred from the charter of the house of St Mary d'Urso that West Street was in existence by 1214 (Sheehy 1959, 156). The street was referred to variously as 'Street to the West Gate' and 'Great West Street' in the surviving medieval documents (Bradley 1984). References to identifiable properties in the street are few, and mainly located at the eastern end of the street, near the junction with Shop Street. Analysis of cartographic evidence suggests that the burgage plots on this street, as in Laurence Street, are of the long variety except where they make the junction with Shop Street and Peter Street (Bradley 1978). Stockwell Lane or Street extends south from West Street, to the Haymarket at the west end of Dyer Street. It is said to take its name from a well used for watering livestock, located near the Haymarket (Garry 1996, 98). The medieval name for the lane was Rochstrete (Bradley 1984) and there are references to it in documents from the early fourteenth century onwards. 451</page><page sequence="2">452 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal SUMMARY OF THE EXCAVATION Phase I: The earliest phase of activity at the site was characterised mainly by a pair of inter-cut pits (C40 and C50) in the southern half of the site. Both pits were heavily truncated on the south by modern activity (C34, C36) relating to Phase VII, and also on the west by the basement of no. 25 West Street. C40 was a pit measuring 0.90m by 0.45m, filled by deposits C45 and C43, which were charcoal flecked and produced animal bone and a selection of pottery sherds - mainly Drogheda Ware. The pit was sealed with a deposit of natural clay (C44). A second, much more substantial pit (C50) was cut into it on the north. The pit measured 2.50m by lm and was filled by a sequence of deposits (C101, C102, C49, C48 and C47) all of which produced charcoal, bone and shell as well as quantities of medieval pottery, mainly Drogheda Ware and Drogheda Coarse Ware, with a selection of Mottled Green Glaze Saintonge. The material from both pits is consistent with domestic refuse. A thin layer of burning (C7l) was situated north-east of the two pits A thin layer of sandy clay (C162) extended over most of the site overlying natural geological strata. It was quite sterile and undifferentiated and appears to be the remains of the original sod layer at the site. Fig. 1. 24-5 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda: site location map.

Phase II: Phase II at the site was mainly characterised by a substantial pit (C110), which partially truncated the earlier pits in the south of the site. Also associated with this phase of activity were the remains of a hearth (C126) and the earliest in a sequence of small stakeholes located in the eastern half of the site. A large sub-circular pit (C110), located in the southern half of the site, was the most substantial surviving feature. It measured 3m by 2.70m with a maximum depth of 1.50m, truncated on the west by the basement of no. 25 West Street. The pit contained a series of deep charcoal-rich, organic fills (C109, C160, C106), which produced animal bone and shell as well as quantities of medieval pottery. These deposits appear to be consistent with domestic refuse. A substantial layer of re-deposited natural clay (C108), which produced a type 4 padlock (02E1268:108:3), was encountered partially sealing the first three fills. It seems likely that this may represent an attempt to seal off the pit. A further four deposits (C151, C159, C158 and C105) sealed C108. As with the earlier fills these deposits produced charcoal, animal bone and shell as well as a quantity of medieval pottery and again appear to represent domestic refuse. A total of fifteen small stakeholes extended across the eastern side of the site only. No clear structural pattern could be discerned from them. Also associated with this is what appears to be the remains of a hearth, characterised by a spread of burnt clay (C126) sealed by a layer of black grey silty clay, flecked with yellow clay and oxidised clay (C116). C116 also sealed a small posthole (Cl 18). The fill of this posthole (Cl 17) produced the remains of an iron artefact with a composite wood and horn handle, bound with copper wire (02E1268:117:1). There were indications that one of the stakeholes adjacent to the hearth (C126) had been burnt in situ. Phase III: Phase III was characterised by a more complex series of features, which included the partial re?ut of Cl 10 (C98). This phase provides the earliest distinct evidence for the plot division at the site, which continues into Phases IV and V. A series of compacted stony layers were recorded from the upper levels of C110, localised on the western side of the pit (C152, C154, C155, C153, C104, C113). These would appear to be the</page><page sequence="4">454 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal oCb? O' ?i?L o' / \ y Fig. 3. 24-5 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda: features associated with Phase III. remains of a series of metalled surfaces, which subsided into C110. They shared an alignment with C161, the remains of a metalled surface, c. 1.20m wide, which extended north from C110 along the western edge of the site. It appears to be the remains of a rough laneway running south from West Street, parallel to Stockwell Lane. C98 was an elongated oval cut into the east side of the earlier pit, C110, to allow for the insertion of C150, a rough clay-bonded stone wall. C150 roughly respected the original shape of C110 and there were no indications that C150 extended beyond the limit of C110. It appears to have been inserted in order to revet the remaining fill of C110, possibly to combat the repeated subsidence of the laneway into Cl 10. C98 was backfilled with a series of organic, charcoal-rich deposits (C148, C156, C147), which produced a quantity of medieval pottery. The remains of a possible hearth (C73) sealed C98 on the east. On the eastern side of the site, C62, a layer of mixed clay with mortar and charcoal flecks sealed the stakeholes associated with Phase II. This layer appeared to respect the laneway (C161). Phase TV: Phase IV represents the final phase of medieval activity at the site. It was characterised by the presence of the wall C25 that bisected the site and reinforced the plot division established in Phase III. A north-south oriented wall footing (C25) bisected the excavation area. It was 6.25m in length, with a maximum width of 0.60m and a surviving height of 0.40m with evidence for a return at its northern end, running east. The wall footing comprised a combination of large, rough stone blocks and small irregular stones, in one surviving course. Though there were indications of the use of mortar, most of the surviving walling appears to have been clay-bonded. The return at the northern end of C25 had been partially incorporated into the later eighteenth-century founda tions (C9). C25 roughly respected the eastern extent of the earlier laneway, C161. Though it followed a similar line to the section of walling cut down into C110, there were no indications of any direct</page><page sequence="5">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth 455 Fig. 4. 24-5 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda: features associated with Phases IV and V link between the two features. It seems most likely that the positioning of both features relates more to the emerging medieval plot division. To the west of C25, and contemporary with it, was a series of metalled surfaces. These reflected the line of the Phase III surface (C161) and the earliest of them (C95) had subsided into the upper part of C110. C96 and C97 were localised in the area above C110 and appear to have been a response to continued subsidence in that area. The latest surface in the series (C30) was the only layer which did not subside to any significant degree into C110. On the eastern side of C25 there was evidence for the build-up of a significant depth of burnt material against C25. These deposits comprised a series of eleven localised layers or dumps of charcoal-rich material, ash and oxidised clay, sealing the earlier occupation layer, C62. These deposits had built up against the wall, becoming laminated by the pressure of continued occupa tion and activity. They would appear to be the rake-out of a hearth or series of hearths, though no obvious hearth was identified. Certainly a miscellaneous collection of animal bone was recovered from some of the deposits, which would appear to be consistent with domestic activity. Also to the east of C25 were a series of twenty-two stakeholes, cut into the Phase III occupation layer, C62. There were indications that some of the laminated burnt deposits had also formed casts around some of the stakes. As with the earlier series of stakeholes, no clear structure could be discerned. Phase V: Phase V represents the earliest post-medieval activity at the site. In the south-east corner a series of mortared stone walls (C41, C54 and C53) were identified, which defined the north-west corner of a structure or building. This building appears to extend south into the rear garden of the adjacent property (no. 23). The western wall of the building was on the same alignment as the medieval boundary wall (C25) and the western boundary wall of the rear plot of no. 23, to the south. The remains of the building were associated with a tile pavement. This tiled pavement (C55) comprises twenty-seven decorated medieval tiles (counting each half tile as one), with two rows of six tiles plus a half tile in situ and the remains of two further rows</page><page sequence="6">456 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal Fig. 5. 24-5 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda: features associated with Phases VI and VII. slightly displaced. A further three displaced tiles were recovered overlying the pavement. The pavement appeared to be contemporary with the three walls which enclosed it (C41, C54 and C53), and to represent the northern end of a tiled corridor which extended south (beyond the limits of this investigation) into the rear garden of no. 23 West Street. A total of nine separate designs were represented in the tile assemblage from the pavement - four line-impressed designs and five relief designs. Several of the tile patterns present were designed to create a continuous pattern, though they are not utilised in this fashion in C55. The relatively large number of patterns, and disordered arrangement, indicates that the tiles were salvaged from other buildings, and that this pavement represents a secondary usage. The five previously recorded patterns (L46, L66, L50, L71 and R68) are well attested from sites in and around Drogheda (Eames and Fanning 1988) and there is evidence that two further relief patterns, used in the pavement, were manufactured at St Mary d'Urso (Campbell in Halpin 1996, 493-5). The presence of R68 is significant in that it has been suggested that this tile pattern is an early sixteenth-century import (Eames and Fanning 1988), indicating a relatively late date for the pavement, probably no earlier than the mid-sixteenth century. At the end of Phase V, most of the north of the site was then sealed with a layer of clay (C16). Dumps of mortar or render (C32, C29) were recorded immediately to the east and west of the wall, C25, sealed under C16, which may be related to the removal or destruction of the superstruc ture of C25. A robber cut (C28), which removed the northern section of this wall, was also recorded. The south of the site (including the early post-medieval building) was sealed by a layer of loosely compacted mortary clay (C37), which would appear to reflect the same activity as C16. A selection of Scottish twopences (02E1268:16:3-9), dating from ?. 1641, was recovered from C16. Phase VI: Phase VI was characterised by the presence of a cobbled laneway across the whole of the excavation area and represents the earliest manifestation of the modern plot division at the site. A cobbled surface (C8) directly sealed C16. Though it had been heavily truncated by the later</page><page sequence="7">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockiuell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth 457 insertion of no. 24, it appeared that the cobbled surface had originally extended across the whole of the area comprising the footprint of no. 24 West Street. There were indications that the cobbled surface extended south to the rear of the buildings fronting Stockwell Lane. A Drogheda token (02E1268:8:6) was recovered from between the cobbles. Phase VII: The final phase of activity at the site was characterised by the construction of no. 24 West Street to infill the earlier laneway. A George III penny (02E1268:ll:l)was recovered from the construction trench for the foundations of no. 24, confirming that the building was constructed in the late eighteenth century. A survey of the standing structure, prior to demolition, had suggested a mid to late eighteenth-century date for its construction (Jordan 2002). THE FINDS Medieval Pottery Assemblage: The medieval pottery assemblage consisted of 633 fragments, the bulk of which was recovered from the first three phases of occupation. Locally produced wares account for 81% of this assemblage, with imported French and English wares forming 13%. The remaining 6% comprised other Irish wares and a small assemblage of unidentified wares. This indicates that Drogheda society was self-sufficient enough to produce all types of pottery required by daily life between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.

Stylistic comparisons can be drawn in particular between Ham</page><page sequence="8">458 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal Fig. 6. 24-5 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda: medieval pottery. Green B pottery (produced in Bristol from the last quarter of the twelfth century to the thirteenth) and elements of Drogheda wares, such as the slashing and stabbing on several strap handles, a slashed design on a single rim top and the thumbed bases of Drogheda wares. The decoration of jug bodies with horizontal straight and wavy combed lines is also similar to Ham Green A decoration. Thumbed applied strips at the rim of locally-produced vessels echo the characteristic rim type of Ham Green A pottery (1120-1175) (Ponsford 1991). Decoration in the form of vertically applied thumbed strips on the body of jugs is reminiscent of classical Saintonge Mottled Green Glazed jug decoration (Barton 1963a). Thin section analysis was carried out on four pottery fragments from this site (in association with samples from a number of other excavations in Drogheda) and compared with analysis of pottery wasters from secure levels within seven of the nine kilns excavated recently from the Old Cattle Market, Magdalene Street, Drogheda. The results of this analysis indicate that the clay used for the majority of these samples is common to several areas on the north and east coast of Ireland. This result could indicate that all clay was extracted from a single site or several sites in this area. It was found, however, that the clay used to create Drogheda Cooking Ware from two of the assemblages was distinctive clay from the Drogheda region, indicating it was extracted nearby (Doyle 2004, 67-9).</page><page sequence="9">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth 459 Fabric Sherds Sherd% MNV MNV% Form Date Saintonge Mottled Green Glazed 67 10.6 Jug 13th-14th Saintonge Green Glazed All Over 3 0.5 Jug L13th-E14th Saintonge Polychrome 4 0.6 Jug L13th-E14th Minety Type 2 0.3 Jug M12th-E13th Ham Green B 3 0.5 Jug L12th-13th Ham Green Undiagnostic 1 0.2 Jug L12th-13th English Unidentified 3 0.5 Jug 13th-E14th?

Drogheda Ware consists of wheel-thrown vessels made locally from the early thirteenth-early fourteenth centuries representing the wheel-thrown version of Campbell's earlier Drogheda Type (in Halpin 1996). The fabric ranges in colour from buff/pink and grey to a hard fired orange surface with a dark grey interior. There are a few small inclusions within the fabric and it is glazed with a brown/green lead glaze. A small portion of the fragments is made from a dark grey, hard fired fabric with a buff-coloured interior surface. This fabric contains small inclu sions of mica and stone. It is decorated only with a patchy, brown-green lead glaze. Petrological analysis of this ware indicated it was fired at higher temperatures than other Drogheda Wares (Doyle 2004,97-99). Incised decoration consists of horizontal combed, wavy and zigzagged lines on the body of the vessel. The incised decoration is similar to Ham Green B (Ponsford 1991) and Minety Type (Davey 1977) and also to Saintonge Mottled Green Glazed wares, all of which were present as imported wares in this assemblage. Applied decoration is frequent in three main forms: unglazed thumbed strips, applied flattened/rouletted strips, glazed in a contrasting colour to the rest of the vessel and applied pellets in a contrasting colour. All the diagnostic elements indicate that the majority of the Drogheda Ware vessels represented were jugs, some of which exhibited sooty exteriors indicating they had been used to heat liquids, presumably wine. The straight handle probably belonged to a small pipkin.</page><page sequence="10">460 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal Drogheda Coarse Ware. Drogheda Coarse Ware appears as hand-built pottery. The fabric ranges from a pink and grey fabric to a hard fired dark orange and grey coloured sandwich. There are large numbers of inclusions including quartz and small stones, some of which are quite large, measuring 10.5mm at the surface. Decoration consists of a brown/green lead glaze, with occasional bands of horizontal combing or rouletting on the body of the vessel. As with Drogheda Ware, a small portion of the Drogheda Coarse Ware assemblage is comprised of fragments made from a dark grey, hard fired fabric with a buff interior and patchy brown/green glaze. Drogheda Coarse Ware dates from the early thirteenth-early fourteenth centuries, and is the hand- thrown version of Campbell's earlier Drogheda Ware (in Halpin 1996). With the exception of a straight handle that probably formed part of a pipkin, all the diagnostic pieces appear to have come from jugs. Drogheda Fine Ware. Drogheda Fine Ware is wheel-thrown and made from a fine fabric that varies in colour from buff and grey to light pink/orange and grey. There are no visible inclusions and vessels are thin walled. Vessels are decorated with a mottled lead glaze, which varies in colour with combinations of green, brown and yellow. Drogheda Fine Ware was produced from the early fourteenth-fifteenth centuries, described as Campbell's later Drogheda Type (in Halpin 1996). Any further decoration on the body of the vessels presents as an applied flattened strip in a contrasting colour. Although there are no spout fragments present the remaining diagnostic elements and the fine nature of the fragments indicate they probably formed jugs or small storage jars. Drogheda Cooking Ware. Drogheda Cooking Ware is a hand-built pottery. The fabric is hard fired and brown-pink and dark grey in colour, often forming a sandwich with the grey between the pink. The fabric contains a large number of sizeable quartz, stone and other inclusions. A granite inclusion particular to the Drogheda area was discovered through petrological analysis in examples of Drogheda Cooking Ware from sites in north Drogheda, though not in this assemblage (Doyle 2004, 97-9). It is most likely that Drogheda Cooking Ware was produced during the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries alongside the other Drogheda Wares. Drogheda Cooking Ware is represented in the assemblage by undecorated body fragments and sagging base fragments. Leinster Cooking Ware. Leinster Cooking Ware dates from the mid-twelfth to fourteenth centuries and is widely found on urban and rural sites in Ireland. It appears within the assemblage as two body fragments. The fabric is characteristic of the type, containing large pieces of quartz, mica and other stone inclusions. The vessels are hand-built. One fragment is burnt externally, indicating that it formed part of a cooking vessel or jug. The other fragment was burnt internally, possibly indicating that it was used as a chafing dish or fire cover. Irish Cooking Ware. This cooking ware, of unknown origin, appears as a quartz-rich, red-brown fabric. The type is represented within the assemblage as two base fragments of hand-built vessel (s). The fabric differs from Leinster Cooking Ware in terms of temper. The fragments are burnt exter nally indicating they formed part of cooking pots/jugs. Minety Type. Minety Type pottery was produced in the North Wiltshire region of England in the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries and was imported into Ireland from the mid-twelfth to the early thirteenth century (McCutcheon and Gahan 1997, 203). This assemblage contained two body fragments. They were from hand-built vessels and illustrate the characteristic pitted interior surface of this type caused by the removal of limestone from the dark grey fabric during firing. Both fragments have a dark green glaze. One is decorated with characteristic wavy horizontal combing and one with straight lines made in the same manner.</page><page sequence="11">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth 461 Ham Green B: Ham Green pottery was produced in Bristol between 1170 and 1250 (Barton 1963b; Ponsford 1991). The fabric of this hand-built ware is typically a dark grey colour, containing inclu sions of quartz and calcite and glazed a mid-dark green. Decoration is typically in the form of horizontal and/or wavy combing with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic incised and applied designs. This assemblage contained four diagnostic pieces of Ham Green B wares: a thumbed base fragment, a rim fragment and two body fragments both with horizontal combing. An additional four body fragments have been identified as Ham Green Undiagnostic due to the lack of any features that would identify them as either Ham Green A or B. It is more than likely, however, that they are from Ham Green B vessels due to the complete lack of any diagnostic Ham Green A elements within the assemblage. Unidentified English: The assemblage contained three body fragments of unidentified English ceramic that I have characterised as: wheel-thrown with a fine, grey fabric and a green/brown lead glaze. Saintonge Mottled Green Glazed: As the name suggests, this pottery has a rich green glaze whose mottled appearance is achieved through the addition of copper filings to a lead glaze. This assem blage contained 63 fragments of Saintonge Mottled Green Glazed ware. These jugs were decorated with horizontal straight and wavy combing and also with the typical Saintonge applied, thumbed vertical strips. Saintonge Green Glazed All Over. Its rich, smooth, even green glaze identifies this type of Saintonge pottery, which is associated with the wine trade. This assemblage contained three body fragments of this type. None exhibited any decoration, although one piece was glazed on both the interior and exterior surfaces. Saintonge Polychrome. This Saintonge pottery is distinctively glazed with a clear lead glaze over patterns painted in yellow, green or brown. These patterns usually feature shields, dogs, horses and cockerels. Of the body fragments from this assemblage, two had a yellow painted pattern, one of which also had horizontal combing and the third fragment of Saintonge Polychrome was painted with a yellow, green and brown pattern. The Post-Medieval Pottery Assemblage. A total of 54 sherds of post-medieval pottery was recovered from the excavation, relating to the final three phases of activity at the site. Medieval Floor Tile Assemblage. A total of 31 examples of decorated medieval floor tiles were recovered from the excavation. The tiles were mainly recovered from C55, a tile pavement; only one example was not associated with this feature. Examples of all three medieval decorative techniques were identified - 14 line-impressed tiles, 16 relief tiles and a single two-colour tile. Where possible the tiles are described using Eames and Fanning's typology. The letter 'L' indicates the category of line-impressed tile, letter 'T' indicates two-colour tile, and 'R' relief tile. The number, which follows, refers to the decorative motif on the tile. Two-coloured tiles date from the twelfth-thirteenth centuries. Line-impressed tiles are dated to the early fourteenth-fifteenth centuries. Relief tiles are the latest dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Tile pavements have only been recorded at ecclesiastical sites in Ireland during the medieval period, though secular examples are recorded from sites in Britain. It is likely that the tiles used to form the pavement at this site were salvaged from ecclesiastical buildings in or around Drogheda.</page><page sequence="12">462 Fabric County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal Sherds MNV Forms Date Frechen 1 Jug C16th-C17th Westerwald 1 Jug C17-C18th Bristol-Staffordshire slipware 6 Cup, unidentified C17th-C18th Mottled ware Tankard Cl7th-C18th Glazed red earthenware Unidentified C18th-C19th Blackware 10 1 storage jar, 1 mug C18th-C19th Transfer printed pearlware 4 1 plate, 1 cup c.l751-present Cream ware 10 2 bowls c. 1762-1820 Pearlware Cup c.l779-present Shell-edged ware Plate c. 1780-1840 English Porcelain Teacup c.l745-present Stoneware 1 tankard, 1 jar?

The excavation produced 142 fragments of clay pipes. Of these finds only two were bowls and the rest were undecorated pipe stems.

This included 21 copper alloy objects, 163 iron objects and a single steel object. Copper Alloy Finds: A total of 21 copper alloy finds were recovered from the excavation, of which only 8 could not be identified as to type. Four definite (02E1268:16:3-4; 02E1268:16:6-7) and four probable (02E1268:16:5; 02E1268:16:8; 02E1268:16:9.1-2) copper alloy Scottish twopences were recovered from C16, which sealed the north of the site at the end of Phase V. The coins are very badly worn, and the stamped impressions can only be partially made out on four. These small lightweight coins, dating to ?. 1641, were produced in large numbers by the earl of Stirling who had secured the licence from the Crown to produce them. The front of these coins normally have a central stamp containing the lettering "C R II" surmounted by a crown, while the reverse contains a centrally placed thistle motif. A coin (02E1268:8:6) recovered from the cobbled land (C8) is a locally- manufactured copper alloy token dating to the seventeenth century. After the death of Charles I shopkeepers, innkeep ers, and others including some local authorities, took into their own hands what had previously been a royal prerogative and began minting their own small change (Seaby 1970, 107). The earliest tokens appeared in 1653 and in Ireland these were normally pennies. They were issued in considerable numbers throughout the 1650s and 1660s and to a lesser extent the 1670s. However the issue of tokens was completely forbidden when the coinage of heavyweight regal copper halfpence was commenced in 1680 (ibid., 108). The front of this example has the words 'OF' and 'DROHE' surrounding a circular stamp containing the letter 'D' over T with a five-pointed star on either side of the lettering. The reverse is very corroded and contains a central motif composed of three pike-like implements. Worn lettering, of which only the letters 'CK', 'O' and a possible 'H' are legible, circles this central stamp. The letters 'CK' appear to form the end of a word and are separated from the next word by a five-pointed star. Of the second word only 'O' can be clearly made out with a possible 'H' or 'N' beside it. The letters T D' signify that this token was worth one</page><page sequence="15">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth 465 penny. This token does not appear to correspond to any of the known corpus of Drogheda tokens (Rice 1984; 1985). A coin (02E1268:11:1) recovered from the foundations of no. 24, appears to be a George III penny. About one third of the coin is missing. It is very badly worn and only a portion of the draped bust and the Roman numerals TIT are visible on the front. The reverse contains a worn crown and the letters 'ER'. From the positioning of the surviving lettering this coin appears to be a Type 3 George III penny. These were minted in London for the Irish market towards the end of the eighteenth century. A small oblong copper alloy loop in two pieces (02E 1268:8:8) was recovered from the cobbled laneway. It is possible that this loop represents the frame of a small D-shaped buckle. A small copper alloy stud (02E1268:37:18) was recovered from C37 which sealed the south of the site at the end of Phase V. It has a domed head (15mm by 6mm) and a short shank. Studs like this could have been applied to belts, straps, boxes, vessels and wood (Scully 1997, 484). Iron Finds Assemblage. A total of 163 iron objects were recovered from the excavation, of which 73 were identified as nails and 83 could not be identified as to type. Phase I II III IV V VI VII Nails 2 9 13 41 0 0 8 Unidentifiable Objects 1 12 5 60 0 1 4 Table 6: Breakdown of iron nails and unidentifiable objects by phase. The majority of the nails were recovered from the medieval phases and were simple carpentry nails, heavily corroded and often incomplete. The frequency of nails from the medieval period probably reflects a greater dependency on wooden structures during this period. The highest concentration of nails came from the phase IV surface, C96. In all 30 nails were recovered from this deposit, which appears to be part of a medieval laneway. One angle tie/hinge pivot (02E 1268:39:4) was recovered from C39, the fill of a Phase I pit. These L-shaped pieces were used at the junction of two timbers for added strength. A heavily corroded Type 4 barrel padlock (02E1268:108:3) was recovered from C108, the fill of a Phase II pit. Barrel padlocks are classified by the method of securing the hasp, which is attached rigidly to the padlock case in types 1 and 2, but is part of the separate bolt in types 3 and 4 (Donaghy 1997, 530). Type 4 barrel locks were used to secure large chests, gates, shutters and doors. Clough Castle, Co Down, yielded a Type 4 barrel lock sealed with door furniture including a figure-of-eight hasp (Donaghy 1997, 532). In Waterford Type 4 barrel padlocks have been recovered from twelfth and thirteenth-century contexts (Donaghy, 530-2). A semi-circular iron fragment (02E1268:108:4) found associated with 02E1268:108:3 appears to be part of the U shaped bolt belonging to the padlock. A possible blade fragment (02E1268:31:6) was recovered during from C31, an occupation layer associated with Phase IV. The blade is flat and elongated with straight sides. It has a rectangular cross-section and no evidence of a tang survives. An iron buckle frame (02E1268:8:10) was recovered from the cobbled laneway (C8). It is a double buckle, i.e., cast with a central bar dividing the frame into two parts. The buckle is rectan gular in shape and has evidence for tinning on its surface. Tin plating was often added to buckles to brighten their appearance and to prevent rusting. Iron buckles were normally used in associa tion with heavy-duty straps (Scully 1997, 179).</page><page sequence="16">466 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal An incomplete composite handle (02E1268:117:1) composed of three materials, iron, wood and bone, was recovered from a posthole associated with Phase II. This elaborately-made handle contains a hollow iron tube at one end into which a composite bone and wood handle is inserted. The handle was split longitudinally into wood and bone. Where the two materials meet along the centre line of the handle, small triangular teeth have been cut out of each, the teeth of one material fitting into the gaps left between the teeth of the opposite material. The bone part of the handle is highly polished and survives in a much better condition than the wooden part. Twelve of the bone teeth survive, six on either side. However, only two of the wooden teeth survive, one on either side. A heavily-corroded iron needle (02E1268:147:1) was recovered from C147, a deposit associated with Phase III. The needle has a long shaft of circular cross-section tapering evenly to a point. The needle eye is absent. The needle is too large and robust for dressmaking and was probably only suitable for use with sacking, sails or the coarsest of fabrics. Steel Finds Assemblage. One steel sewing pin (02E1268:37:4) was recovered during the excavation. Although often called 'sewing pins', they were also used for fixing women's head dress and in general instead of buttons for fastening clothes, as well as for pinning papers and other uses (Biddle and Barclay 1990, 560). The pin has a spiral head and measures 16mm in length. The needle's point is missing. Spiral-type pinheads were manufactured by winding wire into spirals to join the head. Usually a drop-stamp (a piece of machinery operated by the foot) was used to achieve the double purpose of attaching the head and setting the spiral in a globular shape (ibid., 564). The first steel pins date to the early nineteenth century. The pin was found in the Phase V deposit, C37. The presence of a steel pin in what appears to be a seventeenth century context suggests that the pin is an intrusive find. Wooden Finds Assemblage. A single wooden object (02E1268:16:1) was recovered from C16 which sealed the north of the site at the end of Phase V. It appears to be the remains of a simple wooden spindle. DISCUSSION Dating. West Street itself appears to be in existence by 1214 (Sheehy 1959) and the pottery assem blage associated with Phases I and II is indicative of a thirteenth to fourteenth-century date. The Type IV barrel padlock (02E1268:108:3) is likely to date to the twelfth or thirteenth century. The ceramic assemblage from Phase III would tend towards a fourteenth-century date and by Phase IV is indicative of a fourteenth to fifteenth-century date. The occurrence of Drogheda Fine Ware in the assemblage does not peak until Phase IV, whereas the other local wares decline in frequency from Phase I onwards. One of the tiles from the pavement associated with Phase V is an early sixteenth-century import, indicating a date post 1500 for the construction of the building in the south of the site. The pottery assemblage is generally indicative of a sixteenth/seventeenth-century date. A series of Scottish twopence pieces recovered from C16 date to ?. 1641. This indicates that the activity associ ated with Phase V dates from the sixteenth to the mid-seventeenth centuries. A Drogheda token (02E 1268:8:6), which dates from the period 1650-80, was recovered from the cobbled laneway associated with Phase VI and a George III penny (02E1268:11:1) from the foundations of no. 24 itself. This indicates that the activity associated with Phase VI dates from the mid-seventeenth century to the late eighteenth century and that Phase VII dates from the late eighteenth century to the present.</page><page sequence="17">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth 467 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE Initial activity at the site, associated with Phases I and II, was characterised by a series of pits. The nature of the material contained in these would suggest that they functioned as refuse pits. These pits appear to have originally extended east into the area occupied by no. 25 West Street. There were no indications of any structures or subdivisions associated with either of these phases. The main focus of activity, during Phases I and II, was in the south of the site away from the West Street frontage. This, combined with absence of any indications of plot or property bound aries, would suggest that this section of West Street was relatively undeveloped at this point, especially when compared with later phases at the site. During Phase III a formal plot division begins to emerge, principally defined by the laneway (C161) which extended down the west side of the site. Occupation within the Medieval Plot The initial activity within the medieval plot during Phase III is not particularly intensive, and remains similar to that represented by earlier phases at the site. However, during Phase IV the plot division is reinforced by the wall-footing (C25), and occupation within the plot itself becomes much more intensified with a build-up of laminated surfaces. This plot and associated occupation clearly originally extended east into the area now occupied by no. 23 West Street. The present building at no. 23 includes a basement, and it is likely that this has removed any other archaeological strata relating to this plot. No structures could be associated with the occupation of this plot. The main north-south wall (C25) would appear to represent the footing for a boundary wall rather than the structural wall of a building, as it was only 0.60m wide, assuming that it supported a stone superstructure. The high proportion of carpentry nails associated with Phase IV may be indicative of wooden structures or buildings at the site. Unfortunately, the two main scatters of stakeholes did not suggest any obvious structure and may represent the remains of temporary supports or structures associated directly with the possible hearths. It is likely that the level of the oxidised and burnt deposits reflects intensive domestic occupa tion over a prolonged period of time, and the absence of industrial detritus would support such an interpretation. However, as only a narrow section of the plot survived this may reflect localised activity within the plot and may not be representative of activity within this plot as a whole. The Laneway: A laneway can be identified at the site from Phase III onwards, extending along the western extent of the excavation, parallel to Stockwell Lane. The alignment of this laneway is reflected in the alignment of the rear walls and plot boundaries of the buildings fronting on to the north end of Stockwell Lane and it is likely that the modern boundary between nos 24 and 25 reflects the western extent of the laneway. Though the laneway clearly ran parallel to Stockwell Lane, this evidence does not suggest that it would have extended as far south as Dyer Street. The laneway cannot be identified on any of the early maps of Drogheda pre-dating the Ordnance Survey and it has not been possible to identify it in any historical documents relating to medieval Drogheda. However there is a reference in the Gormanston Register to a messuage on West Street 'with the said lane adjoining and belonging to it' (Mills and McEnery 1916, 71). The names of the various adjacent property holders suggest that this particular plot lies further east along the street. A further reference dating to ?_. 1540 (White 1943, 107) describes a laneway on the south side of West Street which gave access to various messuages in fee of St Mary d'Urso and the Hospital of St John at Kilmainham. Again it is not likely that it refers to this specific laneway. Regardless, it may be indicative of a trend in medieval urban development. Bradley (1984) has made the case that the surviving evidence indicates that the burgage plots along West Street were</page><page sequence="18">468 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal of the long narrow variety. It is possible that the construction of laneways such as the one at this site or those referred to in the historical sources may have facilitated the development of these plots for commercial or residential occupation to a greater depth from the main street frontage. Certainly the later sixteenth-century reference would support such an interpretation. The repeated refurbishment of the laneway surface to combat the subsidence caused by the underlying pit (C110), suggests that it must have provided a significant access route, at least locally. It appears that this laneway continued in use along its original alignment during the sixteenth and into the seventeenth century. However the section at its north end, the section within this site, was substantially widened in the mid-seventeenth century. This widening seems to have been associated with a realignment of plot boundaries and property divisions along this section of West Street. However, it should be noted that the cartographic evidence and disposition of the property boundaries to the south of the site only reflect the narrower medieval alignment of the laneway. It is possible that the widening of the laneway was localised at the north end only. Nos 23 and 25 were constructed on either side of the laneway in the early to mid-eighteenth century. The laneway itself was infilled by the construction of no. 24 in the late eighteenth century. The Post-medieval Building. During Phase V a stone building was constructed in the south of the site. This building would have extended into the area now occupied by the rear plot of no. 23, and it is possible that the boundary walls of this plot may reflect the alignment of this building. Only a small section of the north-west corner of this building protruded into the excavation area. The general alignment of the building reflects the medieval plot division already established, and it is likely that this building may actually have fronted on to the laneway rather than West Street, given its position. The tile pavement associated with this building appears to be an original feature. However, the nature and variety of the designs present, combined with the fact that many tiles were cut down to fit, indicates that this pavement reflects a secondary usage of the tiles. The analysis of the tile assemblage indicates that most of the designs are known or indeed produced locally. Therefore it is likely that they were salvaged from an ecclesiastical site or sites in the Drogheda area. At the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1540s many ecclesiastical foundations held property on West Street, including Mellifont Abbey and St Mary d'Urso (White 1943, 107). The resultant re-distribution of ecclesiastical sites and property into secular hands during the latter half of the sixteenth century may provide the context for the creation of this pavement. Many ecclesias tical buildings were refurbished and indeed demolished during this period to accommodate the requirements of their new occupiers. Therefore it is likely that the opportunities to acquire or salvage, good quality medieval tiles for re-use were increased. This building appears to have been demolished in the mid-seventeenth century in association with the realignment of property boundaries along this section of West Street. CONCLUSIONS The excavation provides evidence for a continuous sequence of activity and occupation at the site from the medieval period through to the present day. Though scholars of medieval urban development and specifically of the town of Drogheda itself have posited strong arguments for the perpetuation of medieval property boundaries and plot alignments into modern times, this is not the case at this site. Initial activity and occupation at the site, in the thirteenth/fourteenth century, is characterised by a lack of any clear indications of sub-divisions or plot divisions along any alignment. By Phase III a clear plot alignment emerges, indicating a plot located in the eastern half of the site, defined by</page><page sequence="19">Archaeological Excavations at 24-25 West Street/Stockwell Lane, Drogheda, County Louth 469 the laneway (C161) - this plot would have extended east into the area now occupied by no. 23. It is likely that the boundary between nos 24 and 25 approximates the western edge of the laneway and probably also a further medieval plot. The creation of this laneway (and probably also other similar laneways) may have facilitated the more intensive development and occupation of plots further back from the main street frontages. The medieval plot alignment appears to have remained consistent into the seventeenth century. During the middle of this century (at the end of Phase V), there appears to have been a significant realignment of the property and plot boundaries at this section of West Street to create the modern arrangement. This coincides with a turbulent period in the history of Drogheda, in 1649 Cromwell laid siege to the town and in 1690 the Battle of the Boyne was fought nearby. The later seventeenth century was characterised by the struggle for control of the municipality between the Old English merchant families (largely Catholic) and newer English merchants (largely Protestant) who had begun settling in Drogheda in the early part of the century. These latter were supplemented by the Cromwellian plantation in the early 1650s (Rice 1984). The early to mid-eighteenth century was a much more stable period. Many of the leases in the town expired during this period and the new terms of rental frequently specified building clauses to encourage the redevelopment and modernisation of the streetscape (Casey 1992, 362). The buildings at nos 23 and 25 are likely to have been built at this time (Jordan 2002), with the laneway continuing in use. No. 24 was constructed in the late eighteenth century. A list of businesses on West Street dating from 1846 indicates that no. 24 was functioning as a commercial premises, and a photograph of West Street, dating to ?. 1890 shows nos 24 and 25 as a unified commercial premises (Robinson 1994, 110-11). This unified property was in commercial use immediately prior to its demolition in 2002.
