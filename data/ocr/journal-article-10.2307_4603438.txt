Steadman 13 and Anne V. Stokes2 On the southern Caribbean island of Tobago, we excavated two archaeolog- ical deposits, the preceramic (ca. 2900 years old) Milford 1 site (TOB-3) and the ceramic (ca. 1200 to 900 years old) Golden Grove site (TOB-13). The non-fish bone assemblages from these sites are very different, with an em- phasis at TOB-3 on sea turtles (which seldom nest today on Tobago) and the collared peccary Tayassu tajacu, a large (17-30 kg) mammal extremely rare now on Tobago. TOB-3 also yielded bones of two somewhat smaller mam- mals that are extinct on Tobago, the red howler monkey Alouatta seniculus and paca Agouti paca. The non-fish species at TOB-3 comprise only four reptiles and seven mammals, whereas they are more diverse (29 species) at TOB-13 and mostly represent small- to medium-sized vertebrates (&lt;10 kg, often &lt;1 kg), such as a toad, lizards, snakes, birds, opossum, armadillo, and eight species of rodents, as well as sea turtle and peccary, although the latter is uncommon. We interpret these differences as possibly being due to a local or island-wide scarcity of big game (peccaries) in ceramic times, which would have promoted diversification of hunting practices. Related to this may have been a more sedentary way of life for Tobago's ceramic peoples, with increased agriculture leading to more hunting near the site and less time being devoted to longer distance big-game hunting. While prehistoric anthropogenic extinc- tion or population reduction of vertebrates is well documented on Caribbean islands to the north, our data from Tobago show that such depletions prob- ably occurred as well on continental, land-bridge islands with more diverse 1Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611. 2Southeastern Archaeological Research, Inc., P.O.

KEY WORDS: zooarchaeology; hunting; long-term faunal change; tropical islands; Tobago. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, it has become clear that human impacts on plant and animal communities were significant in prehistoric as well as historic times. Losses of populations or species of animals, especially ter- restrial or aquatic vertebrates, are among the most demonstrable of these impacts. Even though such losses have affected insular faunas more severely than continental faunas, a growing number of continental species have been unable to cope with the habitat alteration, predation, and other ecological changes brought on by millennia of human activities (Martin and Steadman, 1999; Vitousek et al., 1997). Tobago (Fig. 1) lies in an ideal place to compare oceanic (West Indian) versus continental (South American) factors in its changing animal commu- nities. Tobago is smaller (298 kmi2) and more isolated from South America than the neighboring island of Trinidad (4578 kmi2). Both islands lie on the South American continental shelf, although Tobago is not clearly part of the South American or Caribbean plate. Instead, the basement rocks of Tobago (Mesozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks of probable island-arc origin) have been accreted to the South American continental margin through com- plex Mesozoic and Cenozoic interactions along the South American and Caribbean plate boundary, with Neogene sedimentary rocks exposed on the western end of the island (Cerveny and Snoke, 1993; Frost and Snoke, 1989; Snoke et al., 1990,2001; Speed et al., 1991). Tobago's generally rugged topog- raphy, hot and humid climate, and historic land-use patterns are described by Niddrie (1980). Although relatively depauperate compared to that of Trinidad, the ter- restrial flora and vertebrate fauna (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mam- mals) of Tobago are primarily continental in species composition (Beard, 1944; Comeau, 1991; Eisenberg, 1989; Eshelman and Morgan, 1985; ffrench, 1991; Graves and Gotelli, 1983; Hardy, 1982; Hayes et al., 1998; Lack, 1976; Murphy, 1997; Snow, 1985) compared to the truly oceanic biotas of the Lesser Antilles, i.e., the islands from Grenada northward through Anguilla (see Pregill et al., 1994; Schwartz and Henderson, 1991; Steadman et al., 1984a,b; Watters et al., 1984; Wunderle, 1985). Very little excavation has taken place on Tobago, even though 82 prehis- toric archaeological sites or "find-spots" are known (Boomert, 1996, 2000).</page><page sequence="3">Changing Exploitation of Terrestrial Vertebrates 341 0~~ LU~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i co~~ ........o 0i - 0 -~~~~~~~~~~~c r-v 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 0 .... 0...W ~~~7-- ~ ~ ~</page><page sequence="4">342 Steadman and Stokes Most archaeological research thus far has concerned prehistoric ceramic styles, i.e., developing a regional and local stratigraphic and chronologic se- quence of changing pottery manufacture (Boomert, 1996, 2000; Clement, 2000; Harris, 1991), settlement patterns (Boomert, 1996, 2000), and historic archaeology (Clement, 1995, 1996,2000; Eubanks, 1992). This paper will fo- cus on Tobago's prehistoric terrestrial vertebrates, as elucidated from two of the island's better known archaeological sites. METHODS Our field research (9-11 July 1999, 15-22 November 1999, 12 January- 3 February 2000) comprised surface-surveys and excavations of prehistoric sites on the Quaternary coralline limestone lowlands of western Tobago (Fig. 2). Two of the sites, Milford 1 (TOB-3) and Golden Grove (TOB-13), yielded extensive materials that are the basis of this paper. The others, the Friendship site (TOB-15) and Crown Point Caves (TOB-2), had been de- stroyed by looting, previous excavation, and seaward erosion, resulting in our finding no in situ deposits. All excavation was done by trowel except for the most compacted parts of site TOB-3, where the shell-packed sediment (dominated by the large and exceedingly durable gastropod Strombus gigas; see Kamat et al., 2000) had to be loosened for trowel excavation by gently probing it with a pick. Excavations followed the natural stratigraphy (Layers), with arbitrary sub- divisions (Levels) designated within most layers. Depths were taken relative to an established datum (recorded in the field as cmbd, or "cm below da- tum"). In the lab, we used the field excavation forms to convert cmbd to "cm below the surface" or cmbs. All excavated sediments were water-screened in the ocean through sieves of 1/8-inch mesh, with subsampling using sieves of 1/16-inch mesh. The bones at TOB-3 and TOB-13 were in an unequivocal cultural context; we found no evidence that non-human predators may have been involved in their deposition. Our bone identifications are based on direct comparisons with mod- ern skeletal specimens in the Herpetology, Ornithology, Mammalogy, and Zooarchaeology collections at the Florida Museum of Natural History, Uni- versity of Florida (UF). The prehistoric bones from Tobago are housed at UF, on long-term loan from the Tobago Museum. Fish make up &gt;90% of all bones at both sites. The fish bones are being analyzed by Sharyn J. O'Day (UF) and will be the topic of a future paper. The classification, nomencla- ture, and body mass of the vertebrate taxa we identified are presented in Appendix I. We obtained accelerator-mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon (14C) dates from Beta Analytic Inc., Miami, Florida.

THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES Milford 1 (Site TOB-3) We excavated site TOB-3, the only subsurface preceramic site known on Tobago (Boomert, 1996, pp. 78-80,2000, pp. 75-77), from 14 to 21 January 2000. The site lies in a houseyard on a bluff only 60 m from Milford Bay, at an elevation of 5-6 m. Using the habitat classification of Beard (1944), this area probably would have sustained both Littoral Woodland and De- ciduous Seasonal Forest in an undisturbed state, with extensive Mangrove Woodlands immediately to the north. Our excavation of TOB-3 consisted of two adjoining Im2 units adjacent to a ditch that had been dug through the site in the 1950s by Mr. Aubrey Yeates. We defined two strata (Fig. 3), the uppermost (Layer I) being a compacted, organic, cobbly, pebbly, sandy silt with little bedding (Munsell Soil Color Chart 5YR 3/1 very dark brown-dry; 5YR 2.5/1 black-wet). Most clasts are marine shells. Layer I is primarily a topsoil that developed over the main cultural deposit (Layer II). Layer I contains rare prehistoric pottery, lithic artifacts, and shell, and abundant bone, especially of fish. The lower stratum (Layer II) is a darker, more compacted, organic, very cobbly, very pebbly silt with some bedding defined primarily by marine shell (IOYR 3/3 dark brown-dry; IOYR 2/2 very dark brown-wet). Compared to Layer I, the more abundant clasts in Layer II are still mostly of shell in upper levels but also include rocks of diverse types in Levels 3 and 4. Levels 5 and 6 are extremely cobbly and pebbly and directly overlie the weathered limestone bedrock. Most clasts in Levels 5 and 6 are of local limestone. Layer II contains extremely abundant shell and fish bones, and moderately common lithic artifacts and non-fish bone. The only bone reported from a 2 x 1 m excavation in the TOB-3 midden by Boomert (1996, p. 78) was "insignificant amounts of fish bones." By contrast, our excavation (also 2 m2) yielded hundreds of non-fish bones and thousands of fish bones. The only pieces of charcoal recovered at TOB-3 are small and uncon- centrated; we found no hearths or other combustion features. Less than 10% of the bone is burnt. Pottery is absent from Layer II except for several sherds in the uppermost part, perhaps intrusive from Layer I. These sherds are un- diagnostic, small, and in poor condition, suggesting that they are not part of the primary preceramic deposit (Layer II). By contrast, lithic artifacts are</page><page sequence="7">Changing Exploitation of Terrestrial Vertebrates 345 1 2m 0 o - ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~ OVERBURDEN (ditch spoil) o 10- -10 20 - Layer I (disturbed midden) 20 30 - 30 40 - -40 ___ ~~~~~~~Layer II (in situ midden) 50 - 50 60 - LIMESTONE BEDROCK -60 70 --CMBD CMBD - 70 Fig. 3.

Shell beads, bone beads, and bone awls also are present. The only reliable radiometric age determination for TOB-3 is an AMS 14C date from a single humerus of the collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu) that we excavated from Layer II, Level 3 (Table I). This bone yielded a 2cr-age of 2950-2770 Cal B.P. (Beta-153151), which is reasonable for a preceramic site in the Caribbean region, where pottery is rare or absent before ca. 2500 Cal B.P. (Keegan, 1994). We regard our second AMS 14C date (Beta-153936, on a sin- gle dentary of Tayassu tajacu from Layer II, Level 5) as unreliable because the bone did not yield enough collagen to sustain a thorough alkalai wash to remove all soil organics (R. Hatfield, personal communication). The pres- ence of soil organics would decrease the apparent age of the bone. We also regard the three previous conventional 14C dates from Layer II of TOB-3 (ranging from 4875 ? 45 years B.P. to 4020 ? 70 years B.P.; lab numbers GrN-14963-14965; Boomert, 1996, p. 80, 2000, pp. 516-517) as unreliable because they were based on bulk samples of marine shell (consisting of at least four species, Strombus gigas, S. pugilus, Phacoidespectinatus, Cittarium</page><page sequence="8">346 Steadman and Stokes R ?tOJ) t t t C) 0 V: 1= o o o ?

These dates also are subject to the problem of time-averaging, being from multiple specimens. AMS dates based on single identified bones of terrestrial species eliminate these concerns as long as the collagen is well preserved and highly purified during pretreatment (Steadman et al., 1997). Golden Grove (Site TOB-13) We excavated a 1m2 unit at the Golden Grove site from 24 January to 1 February 2000, producing large samples of pottery, lithic, shell, and bone artifacts, and faunal materials (shell and bone). The site lies at ca. 10 m elevation on the Golden Grove Estate, currently a cattle ranch (formerly a sugar plantation; Niddrie, 1980, p. 121), on a bluff overlooking a small stream (see Boomert, 1996, Fig. 9). The nearest straight-line distance to the ocean is 1.1 km northwest to Buccoo Bay. In an undisturbed condition, this area would have sustained Deciduous Seasonal Forest (Beard, 1944). Freshwater wetlands and Mangrove Woodlands are nearby as well. Because of the high density of artifacts, marine shell, and bones at TOB- 13 (see Boomert, 1996, pp. 49-60, 2000, pp. 345-367), and the fact that we had to water-screen all sediments using coarse-through fine-meshed sieves in Buccoo Bay, we were unable in nine days to excavate the single 1m2 unit completely to bedrock. At our final depth of 60 cmbs, the bone and artifact content of the sediment remained rich. We plan to continue to excavate TOB-13 in the near future. The rich midden deposits represent three major strata (Layers I, II, III; Fig. 4). We encountered no postholes, hearths, or charcoal concentrations, although at least 10% of the shell and bone is burnt. Layer I (Level 1) is a very compacted, pebbly, sandy, clayey topsoil (Munsell Soil Color Chart 7.5YR 3/2 dark brown-dry; lOYR 2/2 very dark brown-wet). We subdi- vided Layer II into IIA (Levels 2-4) and IIB (Levels 5-7). Layer IIA is a compacted, slightly cobbly, very pebbly, sandy, clayey silt (1OYR 3/3 dark brown-dry; lOYR 2/2 very dark brown-wet) with most clasts being ma- rine shells, potsherds, or lithic artifacts. Layer IIB (IOYR 4/3 brown/dark brown-dry; lOYR 3/3 dark brown-wet) resembles IIA lithologically but is more compacted and has more marine shells, especially oysters. Layer III (Levels 8-10; lOYR 4/4 dark yellowish brown-dry; lOYR 3/4 dark yellowish brown-wet) is siltier than Layer II, lacks clay, and has a shell content that is highly variable horizontally and vertically. Portions of Layer III are nearly solid shell, especially oysters, that are burned and often fused to bones. The parts of Layer III with lower concentrations of shells are relatively uncom- pacted, but still contain abundant bones.</page><page sequence="10">348 Steadman and Stokes 1 m 10 -1 10 W &gt; &gt;, ~~~~~~ ~ ~~LayerI 20 - - 20 Layer IIA 3 30 - 40 - 40 ~~~~ ~~Layer IIB 50 - _50 60 - LayerII 60 70 - -70 UNEXCAVATED 80 -CMBD CMBD-`-80 Fig. 4. Stratigraphic profile of the west wall of excavation unit 1, Golden Grove site (TOB-13), Tobago. We recovered nearly 2000 potsherds (before conjoining) at TOB-13, yielding a mean of 195 sherds per level (range 99 to 353) and an influx rate of ca. 3300 sherds/m3 of sediment. Numerous potsherds in each of the 10 levels include diagnostic styles that can be classified in Tobago's ceramic sequence as defined by Harris (1991), Boomert (1996, 2000), and Clement (2000), thereby refining the cultural context of the bones from TOB-13. Layer I (Level 1) has a mixture of "Plymouth" and "Golden Grove" ceramics. The temper is coarser and more abundant than in pottery from lower levels, and the vessel exteriors are usually poorly smoothed. One large sherd with geo- metric incising has a conical lug that is spirally incised. Other incised sherds from Level I conjoin with those from Levels 2 and 3 of Layer IIA. These sherds appear to be classic Golden Grove style with parallel scallop incis- ing and ornate geometric incising. Some sherds from Layer IIA are poorly smoothed or have lightly scratched surfaces. Bowls are the predominant vessel form. The ceramics in Layer IIB have more precise incising than in Layers I or IIA. The modeling is characteristic of the "Friendship" series, based on ceramics from the Friendship site (TOB-15; Fig. 2). Incised designs in- clude circle-dot and curvilinear patterns. Two sherds from Layer IIB, a mod- eled foot and a red-painted anthropomorphic adorno, show a "Barrancoid influence" that is present in ceramics on many Lesser Antillean islands after</page><page sequence="11">Changing Exploitation of Terrestrial Vertebrates 349 A.D. 500. The sherds from Layer III also belong to the Friendship series, but exhibit increased modeling and incising. Red and white paint, some in zones divided by incising, and burnishing are more common than in Layers I or II. Broad-line incising gives way to fine-line, and the variety of vessel forms increases to include bowls with restricted necks, inturned (carinated) bowls, and spouted vessels. Ring bases and D-strap handles occur in all levels, as do rim sherds with parallel incising on or below the rim. Non-ceramic ar- tifacts from TOB-13 include a crude chert blade, quartz flakes, shell beads, bone beads, bone awls, and all stages of manufacture of quartz diorite beads. At 95.4% confidence, our two AMS radiocarbon dates on mammal bone from TOB-13 (Table I) are 970-890, 870-800 Cal B.P. from Layer II, Level 2 (6/9-11/16 cmbs) and 1260-1050 Cal B.P. from Layer III, Level 10 (49/56-58/63 cmbs). The previous 14C chronology of the Golden Grove site consisted of six conventional dates on bulk samples of marine shell ranging from 860 i 35 to 1100 ? 35 yr B.P. (GrN-14955-14960; Boomert, 1996, pp. 56, 57). As with the three shell-based radiocarbon dates from TOB-3 (see above), the six conventional 14C dates from TOB-13 reported by Boomert (1996, 2000) were based on multiple marine shells (therefore subject to time-averaging) and were not corrected for the marine reservoir effect. RESULTS The non-fish bone assemblage from the preceramic Milford 1 site (TOB- 3) represents only 11 species, dominated by sea turtle (Cheloniidae sp.; pos- sibilities are Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, and Eretmochelys imbricata) and the collared peccary Tayassu tajacu (Tables II, III). Most of the badly broken bones listed as "Medium/large mammal" may be from T tajacu as well. This species is extremely rare on Tobago today (E. Clarke, personal communication). The only whole specimen of T tajacu from the island, in the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (USNM 538074), was killed by a local hunter in forested eastern Tobago on 4 August 1979 (Hardy, 1982). The nesting status of cheloniid sea turtles on Tobago today is unclear (Murphy, 1997, pp. 103-110). Two other bones from TOB-3 represent species of mammals that cer- tainly no longer occur on Tobago and have not been recorded previously from the island, namely the red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) and paca (Agouti paca). These two forest-dwelling species still inhabit Trinidad and the South American mainland (Alkins, 1979; Eisenberg, 1989).

The non-fish bone assemblage from the ceramic-age Golden Grove site (TOB-13) is taxonomically diverse, representing at least 29 species of small-, medium-, and large-sized amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals (Tables IV, V). Bones of sea turtles and the collared peccary occur regularly at TOB-13, although, unlike at site TOB-3, peccary bones are outnumbered at TOB-13 by those of smaller species such as iguana (Iguana iguana), boa constrictor, opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), armadillo (Dasypus novem- cinctus), and agouti (Dasyprocta leporina). The more diverse herpetofauna at TOB-13 includes the toad Bufo marinus. While it has been introduced widely on tropical islands in historic times, the populations of B. marinus on Trinidad and Tobago were considered to be indigenous by Zug and Zug (1979), an idea supported by the prehistoric records. The 10 taxa of birds from TOB-13 all still exist on Tobago (ffrench, 1991; DWS, personal observation, 1999,2000). They range from small species such as a flycatcher of the forest and forest-edge (Cnemotriccus fuscatus) to large species of wetlands (the herons Ardea alba, Nyctanassa violacea) and forest/forest-edge/swamp forest (the hawk Buteogallus urubitinga and chachalaca Ortalis ruficauda). The 13 bones of B. urubitinga could all be from one individual. The forest-dwelling parrot, Amazona amazonica, is the only bird that may not occur within several km of the site today. This parrot prefers forest but also will use large trees in non-forested areas (F. E. Hayes personal communication). Note that the stated habitat preferences of these birds apply only to Tobago and not to Trinidad or the South American mainland. The eight species of rodents from TOB-13 consist of six small species as well as the agouti and the extirpated paca. The local status of the small mammals is unstudied in the Golden Grove region, although each species is believed still to inhabit some part of Tobago (Hardy, 1982; Eshelman and Morgan, 1985). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The vertebrate assemblages from the preceramic Milford 1 site (TOB- 3) and the ceramic-age Golden Grove site (TOB-13) are readily compared because they are based on similar volumes of excavated sediment (0.46 m3 from Layer II of TOB-3 vs. 0.6 m3 from Layers I-III at TOB-13) that were micro-screened using identical methods. The 306 non-fish bones at TOB-3 yield an influx of 665 bones per m3 of sediment, compared to a value roughly twice as large (1303 bones per m3) for the 782 non-fish bones at TOB-13. These values are similar enough that the major differences in species</page><page sequence="15">Table IV.

The number of species recovered at TOB-3 was considerably fewer than at TOB-13 (11 vs. 29; Table VI). Among the four classes of terrestrial verte- brates, the largest difference in species richness was in birds, with 10 species at TOB-13 (two herons, hawk, chachalaca, dowitcher, two doves, parrot, fly- catcher, and passerine) versus none at TOB-3. Other important distinctions are the richer sets of lizards (four vs. one species) and small rodents (six vs. one species) at TOB-13. TOB-3 yielded bones of two species of mammal that no longer occur on Tobago (red howler monkeyAlouatta seniculus, paca Agouti paca); A. paca was recorded as well at TOB-13. The values among classes of vertebrates for " % NISP" and " % MASS" are similar between the two sites when bones of sea turtles are included (Table VI). Eliminating the heavy, taphonomically conspicuous bones of sea turtles, and thereby focusing just on terrestrial rather than marine verte- brates, a different picture emerges, where percent NISP and percent MASS of reptiles (lizards and snakes) are much lower, and of mammals much higher, at TOB-3 than at TOB-13. Considering the four most abundant mammals (Table VII), the col- lared peccary Tayassu tajacu has an influx value (bones per cube meter of sediment) more than double, a percent NISP more than 13 times greater, and a percent MASS more than four times greater at TOB-3 than TOB- 13. The opposite trend applies to the three species of medium-sized mam- mals, each of which is more poorly represented at TOB-3 than at TOB- 13 (Table VII). At 17-30 kg (Appendix I), Tayassu tajacu is the largest mammal from the sites. Next largest are the two extirpated species, Agouti paca (5-13 kg) and Alouatta seniculus (3.6-11.1 kg), followed by the extant nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus and agouti Dasyprocta lepo- rina, each of which weighs ca. 3 to 6 kg. Bones from all of these mammals have been reported from archaeological sites on Trinidad (Wing and Reitz, 1982).</page><page sequence="20">358 Steadman and Stokes Table VII.

NISP = number of identified specimens (excludes sea turtles and "medium-large mam- mals" ). Data from TOB-3 are only from Layer II. Our data from TOB-3 suggest that, when not fishing or capturing sea tur- tles, exploitation of vertebrates in late preceramic times on Tobago focused on hunting big game (peccaries). The diversification of hunting practices in ceramic times, as indicated by the taxonomically rich set of bones from TOB-13, may have been due to a local or island-wide scarcity of peccaries. Alternatively, Tobago's ceramic peoples may have been more sedentary than the preceramic peoples, with increased agriculture leading to more oppor- tunistic hunting of any sort of game near the site, and less time devoted to more specialized hunting of larger game. That a scarcity of peccaries may have developed within the ceramic era is suggested by the bone counts at TOB-13, with 0-3 peccary bones per level for Levels 1-9 but an increase to 9 bones in Level 10 (Table IV). The combined peccary data from TOB-3 and TOB-13 suggest a population depression of highly. ranked prey, as has been evidenced in the archaeological record in a number of situations, whether insular or continental, temperate or tropical (Broughton, 1994, 1997; Butler, 2001; Steadman, 1995). We do not believe that site location is responsible for the difference in exploitation of peccaries. If anything, one would expect less rather than more big-game hunting at a coastal site (TOB-3) than an inland site (TOB-13). The non-fish bone assemblages from TOB-3 and TOB-13 are very dif- ferent from those in the Lesser Antilles, which are oceanic islands lying just north of Tobago. In the Lesser Antilles, archaeological bone assemblages feature relatively more bones of birds, including various seabirds, rails, pi- geons, doves, parrots, and thrashers, many of which are extirpated (Pregill et al., 1994; Reis and Steadman, 1999). Mammalian bone in Lesser Antil- lean archaeofaunas is dominated by extinct species of endemic rice rats (Oryzomyini sp.) and lacks any of the species found at either TOB-3 or TOB-13 except Dasyprocta leporina and, rarely, Didelphis marsupialis and Dasypus novemcinctus. None of these last three species of medium-sized</page><page sequence="21">Changing Exploitation of Terrestrial Vertebrates 359 mammals, however, is indigenous to the Lesser Antilles, where they were introduced by people prehistorically, probably at least 2000 years ago (Pregill et al., 1994). Only three (all aquatic) of the 10 species of birds and none of the 12 species of mammals recorded from the Tobagonian sites are indigenous to the Lesser Antilles, whereas all 22 of these species can be found on Trinidad and the South American mainland (Appendix I), reflecting the continental nature of Tobago's vertebrate fauna. We found no clear evidence of inter-island transport of non-native species to Tobago, whether from Trinidad, mainland South America, or the Lesser Antilles. We interpret the past presence of Alouatta seniculus and Agouti paca on Tobago as suggesting prehistoric or historic extirpa- tion rather than prehistoric introduction. This is supported by numerous examples from tropical islands where fossils from precultural, paleonto- logical sites show that seemingly extralocal species found in archaeologi- cal contexts were in fact indigenous (Pregill et al., 1994; Steadman, 1993, 1995). This notion is bolstered further by the likelihood that Tobago was con- nected to Trinidad (and therefore to mainland South America) during late glacial times. Both islands lie within the 100 m bathymetric contour on the continental shelf of South America (Defense Mapping Agency, 1994, 1995). One can traverse the 12-15 km of ocean between Trinidad and Tobago to- day without crossing water deeper than 80 m. Sea-levels lower than -80 m were sustained from ca. 30,000 to 14,000 years ago (30-14 ka), with the greatest lowering (at the glacial maximum from ca. 22 to 19 ka) being 120- 140 m below present sea-level (Clark and Mix, 2000; Rohling et at., 1998; Yokoyama et at., 2000). The date of final separation of Tobago from Trinidad was estimated reasonably at 14 ka (Comeau, 1991). Subsequent data on past sea-levels corroborate this estimate, assuming no major changes in local topography, sedimentation, or regional uplift/subsidence. For example, the sea-level rose to -90 m at ca. 15 ka, -80 m at ca. 14 ka, and -70 m at ca. 13 ka according to Clark and Mix (2000, Fig. 1). Following Hanebuth et al. (2000), sea-level went from -114 m to -99 m between 19.0 and 14.6 ka, then rose more rapidly from 14.6 to 14.3 ka to -80 m, followed by another more gradual rise to -64 m from 14.3 to 13.1 ka. A former direct land connection would have inoculated Tobago in the late Pleistocene (and perhaps at earlier glacial maxima; see Rohling et al., 1998) with most of Trinidad's species of terrestrial mammals and other ver- tebrates. Tobago's modern vertebrate fauna, however, is much less rich in species than that of Trinidad, with ca. 14 vs. 32 amphibians, 37 vs. 69 rep- tiles, 92 vs. 247 resident birds, 6 vs. 31 non-chiropteran mammals, and 20 vs. 62 bats (Eisenberg, 1989; ffrench, 1991; Murphy, 1997). If most of these</page><page sequence="22">360 Steadman and Stokes differences in species richness are due to losses on Tobago in the past ca. 14,000 years, then two nonexclusive processes may be involved. One would be "relaxation" to a reduced species-richness number on the smaller is- land, a phenomenon defined by Diamond (1972) as an outgrowth of equilib- rium theory (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967). The other process would be an- thropogenic extinction, which usually operates more thoroughly on smaller than on larger islands (Steadman, 1995). Prehistoric bones can provide ev- idence for the past presence of species, but they cannot prove the cause of disappearance. Anyone comparing the faunas of Tobago and Trinidad should bear in mind as well that Trinidad, while larger and less isolated than Tobago, is nevertheless an island today by South American standards and undoubt- edly has undergone significant faunal losses itself since rising seas during deglaciation severed it from the continent. Although Tobago's plant and an- imal communities are more depauperate and therefore differ ecologically from those of Trinidad (Feinsinger et al., 1982, 1985; Keeler-Wolf, 1986), it is a testimony to ecological plasticity that many of these differences may have developed only within the past 14,000 years or so, a rather short period of time. The early (&gt;3000 years old) archaeology of Tobago is unknown. People probably colonized Tobago at least as early as Trinidad's oldest documented occupation (ca. 8000-6000 yr B.P.) at the Banwari Trace site (Boomert, 2000; Harris, 1973). As on nearby mainland South America (Cooke, 1998), both islands probably were colonized by Paleoindians (ca. 13-12 ka) as well. Fos- sils from noncultural deposits (of unknown age but perhaps early Holocene or late Pleistocene) in the Crown Point Caves (site TOB-2; Fig. 2) help to reconstruct vertebrate communities during or preceding the first hu- man occupation of the island. Only the mammal fossils from these caves have been studied (Eshelman and Morgan, 1985); they include each of the species we recorded at TOB-3 or TOB-13 except the extirpated Alouatta seniculus and Agouti paca. Seven other non-chiropteran species of mam- mals recorded from these caves by Eshelman and Morgan (1985) are not known on Tobago today-the extinct glyptodont Glyptodon sp. and six lo- cally extirpated species (the rodents Calomys hummelincki, Rhipidomys leu- codactylus, and Sigmomys alstoni, rabbit Sylvilagus cf. floridanus, peccary Tayassu pecari, and deer Mazama americana). Thus at least nine species of nonvolant mammals have vanished from Tobago in late Quaternary times. While it may never be possible to determine the relative importance of "re- laxation" versus anthropogenic extirpation in these losses, through further excavation of dated sites we can improve our estimates of which species disappeared and when.</page><page sequence="23">Changing Exploitation of Terrestrial Vertebrates 361 ,_F W ~~~~~~~~~~~~~I I III I I I f lI cto 0. ,c VCO O X CCO H ; 9z In o ooHoNa C O= ,UW , ?t 0V C) CO (? -tO; CC); o; v v v CIIC _ CO 00 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~00\ u -O 0 O (N &gt; -~~ &lt; (NI IN _~~ 00t O 0~~~~~~Oc 0~~~~~~~~~~~0 7-~~~~~~~~~~~~- o 0~~ ct C-t 0~~~~O -ou C</page><page sequence="24">362 Steadman and Stokes 0 o CO 04 0 S Z I I I I IT _ D t O o t ^t &lt;s O E CO &lt; ] &lt; ' t &gt; N ^ a &gt; C 0(1)0~~~~~~~~ CO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~O =~~~~Q ,= c tX;- E~ E &lt; E I z &gt; &lt; : 9Z)a &gt;v at, SO O :: Z Ct -t t S X&gt;&gt;X | o Ct o.
