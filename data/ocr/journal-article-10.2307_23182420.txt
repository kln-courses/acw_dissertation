<plain_text><page sequence="1">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis The Epistemology of Ethnographic Field Research Jadran Mimica Abstract: In this article I sketch out some fundamental aspects of eth nographic practice and understanding within the framework of phe nomenology and psychoanalysis. Their synthesis, created through continuous field research and self-transformative thinking, offers a deeper understanding of psyche, unconscious, and imagination as the generative matrix of human cultural life-worlds. Moreover, this view posits ethnographic experience and creation of critical gnosis as the pri mary condition for the restoration of anthropological self-understanding and the pursuit of truth-bound knowledge and action. Keywords: ethnography, life-world, New Guinea, phenomenology, psycho analysis, self-reflection I For the purpose of this presentation, I will define myself as an ethnographer whose quest is for an accurate interpretation of the Yagwoia life-world (Papua New Guinea) in terms of these people's own cosmo-ontological categories and concrete practices. From the very beginnings of my ethnographic project (my first long-term field work having started in 1977), I accepted the common view that anthropological understanding is bedeviled by the practitioners' own cul tural biases and uncritical use of a range of concepts specific to Occidental cultural, especially academic, frameworks of knowledge—from the scientific to the commonsensical. These are constituted as a personal egoic synthesis of understanding, affectivity, and cognitive practice. This perspective has been and still is a basic step toward a standard exercise of anthropological self-critique. Indeed, through ethnographic practice anthropology inherently calls for a radi cal, critical reflection on itself as a project of critical knowledge of human beings by human beings. I also regard this perspective as a sort of shared normative value among anthropologists. Therefore, one can assume it to be a trademark Social Analysis, Volume 53, Issue 2, Summer 2009, 40-59 ® Berghahn Journals I doi: 10.3167/sa .2009.530203</page><page sequence="2">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis | 41 characteristic of any anthropologist working as an ethnographer. However, describing concretely the practice of critical knowledge and understanding in the case of any particular ethnographer is an open problem. Correlative to this indeterminate reality of the actual process of anthropological knowledge mak ing are the overt epistemological self-presentations by specific practitioners. These too have to be critically considered. It is the practitioner's ethnography and concrete interpretations that will be the primary basis for judging his/her self-accomplishment as the epistemic subject, understood as an ongoing per sonal dynamic synthesis of his/her knowledge-and-ignorance. It is important to be mindful of this dialectical determination of knowledge, namely, that there is no knowing without an N number of correlative modes of unknowing, the most important ones being determined by the un/con scious1 structures of the personality and the narcissistic dynamics of its egoity, both of which shape and co-determine volitional cogitation and objectifica tion, the latter usually through the activity of writing. Thus, conterminous with the positive will to knowledge, there is a negative will that generates a myriad of intentional modifications of what is seemingly a positive self-pro jection. Accordingly, the epistemic subject, apart from knowing that which s/he endeavors to know, is also the one who always knows less than what is knowable about his/her chosen subject matter. This is the horizon of positive, factical ignorance, which is inexhaustible. But in addition, s/he also is the subject of his/her own ignorance because s/he does not want to know. To be sure, s/he actively suppresses this self-determination qua negative will from within his/her volitionally sustained self-consciousness. Of the two modalities of ignorance, it is this latter negativity that is of critical importance, since it shapes the subject's relation to the project of knowledge as a dynamic totality, most importantly, its immanent horizon of truth, which is determined by the subject's own activity as the author of his/her knowledge and its veracity. As for the object of his/her knowledge and understanding, for the moment I will not prioritize some alien cultural life-world that the ethnographer strives to interpret as best as s/he can and preferably in its own terms, but rather the ethnographer's own native intellectual tradition, which enables him/her to carry out his/her project as a project of knowledge. And since I will take the Western anthropologist as my prototypical ethnographer, it is the Western intel lectual tradition that is in question. Having delimited the epistemic situation within this particular cultural-historical horizon, I will provide a few additional specifications of the epistemic subject. Thus, to the extent that the anthropologist experiences, explores, and cogi tates any specific life-world (e.g., myself in relation to the Yagwoia), s/he does so relative to his/her own cultural life-world, specifically, its intellectual tradition. Now, it is an open question as to whether this knowing subject is in any credible way knowledgeable of his/her Occidental cultural life-world and its intellectual tradition, or whether s/he would have a mindful and open orientation toward it, which is to say that this life-world, too, has to be understood in its own terms. In this regard, the following will have to suffice as a fairly realistic character ization. Anthropologists differ from each other in terms of their knowledge of</page><page sequence="3">42 | Jadran Mimica anthropology and their ability to transform this knowledge, obtained through undergraduate and postgraduate studies, into an ethnographic project. Equally so, they mutually differ with respect to their relation to the wider horizon of critical knowledge and intellectual tradition to which anthropology belongs as a body of Occidental cultural knowledge. Bluntly stated, some ethnographers are more knowledgeable 'all around', as it were, than others. Nonetheless, any ethnographer in relation to his/her cultural intellectual tradition is its conduit, and in this determination (by no means absolute and unalterable) s/he is mak ing some other (alien) life-world intelligible, as best as s/he can, through a mixture of knowledge and ignorance of primarily his/her own cultural frame works of knowledge. This I take to be the plight of every anthropologist and ethnographer. This is why, I hasten to say, anthropological self-critique and epistemological self reflection should not be viewed solely as self-gratifying rhetorical bravado and expostulation about Western culture and its 'metaphysics', examples of which abound in current academic 'discourses'. Instead, they would have to be more concretely informed and thoughtful explorations of Western cultural life-worlds and, especially, the vicissitudes of the Western tradition of critical thought. To the extent that a viable ethnographic understanding and interpretation of other human beings and their life-world presupposes the practice of critical self-knowledge,2 it is not an exaggeration to point out that anthropology qua the ethnographic project is one of the most radical and demanding undertak ings in the quest for knowledge and understanding. II Consider the contrast between Levi-Strauss's and Malinowski's self-testimo nies about their respective field experience. Fundamentally, Levi-Strauss's Tristes Tropiques (1973) is an intellectual-aesthetic testimony of a limited ethnographic project, although it can also be seen as a failure.3 But if he failed to achieve recognition as an ethnographer, Levi-Strauss did become a truly great anthropologist. Defeated and overwhelmed by the flesh-and-blood concreteness of specific modes of Amerindian existence, he reconstituted himself through the universality of anthropological perspective, which freed him "from doubt, since it examines those differences and changes in mankind which have a meaning for all men, and excludes those peculiar to a single civilization, which dissolve into nothingness under the gaze of the outside observer. Lastly, it appeases that restless and destructive appetite I have already referred to, by ensuring me a virtually inexhaustible supply of mate rial, thanks to the diversity of manners, customs and institutions. It allows me to reconcile my character with my life" (ibid.: 58-59). In his case, the narcissistic wound (well attested to in the chapter "The Apotheosis of Augus tus") (ibid.: 373-382) and character were transmuted through a magnificent intellectual self-synthesis and a matching illustrious academic career. One's character is assuaged by one's life.</page><page sequence="4">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis \ 43 The last sentence in Malinowski's A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term (1967: 298) is "Truly I lack real character." The inner, un/conscious horizon of Malinowski's fieldwork situation was determined by the archetypal dimension of his primordial condition. Enwombed by pre-Oedipal symbiotic (incorpora tive) identifications with his Mother, Malinowski was struggling with his narcis sistic-symbiotic character. As he recounts: "In the evening the devil persuaded me to call on Dr Simpson. I went in a bad humor and completely torpid, and climbed slowly up the hill... At moments was assailed by blackest depression. Today, Monday, 9.20.14, I had a strange dream; homosex., with my own dou ble as partner. Strangely autoerotic feelings; the impression that I'd like to have a mouth just like mine to kiss, a neck that curves just like mine, a forehead just like mine (seen from the side). I got up tired and collected myself slowly" (ibid.: 12-13). A split soul, Malinowski was living internally as an adhesive syzygy of his inner Mother, craving a narcissistic ideality of his primordial monadic unity: "My whole ethics is based on the fundamental instinct of uni fied personality" (ibid.: 296). This "fundamental instinct" is his intra-psychic umbilicus, which he never severed. This is why his monadic instinct revealed to him the only place in which he could experience self-unity: "At times I see Mother still alive, in a soft grey hat and a grey dress, or in a house dress, or in a black dress, with a round black hat.—Again frightening thoughts: death, a skeleton, naturalistic thoughts interwoven with pain in the heart. My own death is becoming something infinitely more real to me.—Strong feeling—to join her in nothingness. I recall things Mother used to say about death. I recall the countless occasions when I deliberately cut myself off from Mother, so as to be alone, independent—not to have the feeling that I am part of a whole—furi ous regrets and guilt feelings" (ibid.: 297). Correlative to this interior situation, in the exteriority of two Melanesian life-worlds (Mailu and the Trobriands), Malinowski conducted fieldwork that produced a magisterial ethnographic corpus and laid the foundations for the project of ethnography and, relative to it, anthropological theory building. To top it off, he left a profound document of his own inner being, handwritten in his Mother tongue, with no plan to publish it in order to make self-gratifying epistemological and moral capital out of it. To conduct a systematic psychoanalysis as an ethnographer in relation to individual (local) co-workers facilitates a better management and understand ing of the personally very demanding and self-alienating experiences that com monly characterize ethnographic research and are constitutive of its results (see Devereux 1967). Furthermore, I hold that insofar as it purports to be a productive science of human existence, anthropology has to be founded upon phenomenology and psychoanalysis. Castoriadis's (1987) theoretical work pro vides one particular lead that may be used to implement, through concrete work, the unsurpassed horizons of psychoanalytic anthropology developed by Freud, Jung, Rank, and Roheim.4 What I advocate is a self-critical ethnographic psychoanalysis that is shaped by self-transformative transferential-countertrans ferential relations between the ethnographer and the specific individuals (infor mants) who mediate for the ethnographer their life-world and its constitutive</page><page sequence="5">44 I Jadrari Mimica imaginary (see, e.g., Mimica 2006, 2007a; Weiss and Stanek 2007). In trying to reach the depths of a culture that he/she is exploring, the very foundations of the ethnographer's egoity are in question. What is challenged is the most cher ished and deeply ingrained sense of humanness as the function of one's own egoity. In this regard, Devereux's (1967) insights are as vital as ever. In doing ethnography, one's character and personality structure are both the limiting and facilitating conditions of the ethnographic project itself. Here, a self-reflective exercise has to be carried out in a Malinowskian mode. The ethnographer has to work through his/her own egoic self-erosion, defenses, and projections, and, equally so, through the defenses and projections of the informants (Mimica 2003a, 2003b, 2007a). Through this process, the ethnog rapher is genuinely creating a critical understanding that is grounded in the depths of his/her and other people's psychic being. Unless one is willing to work self-critically at this level, ethnographic understanding will not break out of the limitations of the ethnographer's self-idealizations that are rooted in his/ her inner archaic-narcissistic position.5 Only through the modification of this self-deceiving yet vital threshold of the ethnographer's subjectivity will a self reflective and critical method produce a more acute and objective mode of eth nographic understanding. In this sense, the theoretical basis of an empirically validated verstehen method (Weber) must necessarily be developed through phenomenology and psychoanalysis. No formulaic application or supervision is a viable solution; every practitioner has to discover the objective possibilities of subjective understanding in the first person and through empirical practice. If one aspires to perfectibility in the field of indefinite knowledge shaped by omnipresent ignorance, that is, if the ethnographer aspires to an ever more accurate ethnographic knowledge and its synthesis into theoretical understand ing, the only way is through intensive and, in principle, endless concrete work, a permanent self-modification that can be characterized as an intra-psychic surgery by one's own hand—and without an anesthetic. One can learn it all from Freud, Jung, Klein, Fairbarn, Winnicott, and Guntrip, or from Husserl and Sartre. And, of course, in the process one is making errors. The only remedy is that one should be willing to endeavor to detect and duly correct them, which in turn requires more fieldwork, more self-exercise of authentic relations with one's own fieldwork experience and labor, more thinking, more suffering. All in all, it is worthwhile, but not because, as the ethnographer Herdt (2001: 28) recently put it, "anthropology may be an impossible dream (which may die, if not nurtured)." This is an idealization, and hence the rhetorical incantation of anthropology as "an impossible dream"—as if the 25 years of Herdt's own pro fessional life as a prominent figure in American institutions and as the recipi ent of numerous grants were not enough to convince him that (at least as an academic profession) anthropology is a wholly socio-economically and politi cally realized practice that allows him and numerous other anthropologists to pursue it as a self-project, which they actualize every which way. And when it is practiced as a self-critical and self-responsible activity, at its best it may be humanizing in the sense that one may choose to make the best possibilities out of one's own far from perfect, and perfected, being.</page><page sequence="6">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis | 45 An ethnographer neither lives the life nor dies the death of the people s/he is working with. And yet it is the interrelations between the two and the dynamics of human passions and radical imagination that constitute the ontological nexus of any given life-world. To be sure, human facticity does not exist outside of its own human self-constitution. Intrinsic to every society, being the field gener ated as the dynamic structure of egoic bodily intersubjectivity, is the internal self-defense against itself, its own weaknesses, vulnerability, and sham, along with the amplification of its own ideality and omnipotence. The constitution of every human society primordially includes a synthesis of its own ambivalence and the concomitant schizoid dynamics that generate its totalization. Power, exploitation, violence, and distortions, vulnerability and sham—these should not be approached as primarily the symptoms of failure at the synthesis, but the very reality of every human social synthesis. Therefore, for every anthro pologist the preparatory task is to open him/herself up to a mood that discloses this very situation of total humanness, and this demands a creative effort—the effort to create a new horizon of intelligibility that correlates with a particular ethnographic encounter. To descend into the pleroma of total humanness and to behold with understanding its expression in each particular human situation, one has also to recognize it in oneself and as such to acknowledge this transper sonal ontological horizon of the psychic being over and against one's own social-cultural-historical, moral, and intellectual finality. Herein is the perma nent relevance of psychoanalysis and anthropology in the conquest of human ignorance and the creation of knowledge, truth, and human freedom. The acuteness of ethnographic understanding depends on a will to enter into this pleromatic matrix of existence, which psychoanalysis and phenom enology can clarify and deepen like no other framework of critical reflection, providing that it is practiced with a total commitment to the project of eth nography for which "one's character in relation to one's life" (Levi-Strauss 1973) is in need of self-critical transformation rather than self-reconciliation. One can reconcile oneself with oneself, but one can still misunderstand both oneself and other humans. Ignorance, self-deception, and false consciousness are not taken care of by any techniques of reconciliation. Rather, the latter requires the former. In this view, anthropology is far from being an impossible dream. Its self-transcending actualization is effected through each individual practitioner's will to achieve true self-recognition and the will to choose to act accordingly as an epistemic subject. Critical in psychoanalytic practice are the vicissitudes of the narcissistic depths of the human egoic self (its archaic core), the ethnographer's no less than that of the individuals s/he is working with. There is no possibility of escaping the archaic narcissistic dynamism of the egoic un/consciousness, but one can learn how to contend with it and avoid being defeated in the pro cess. As a bonus, one can use it more constructively, such as in the service of the creation of a more realistically viable self-grounded and self-accountable knowledge of oneself and others. Many anthropologists with what I shall call 'refle-x-tionist' sensibilities do not seem to appreciate sufficiently that a critical self-reflection is not the same</page><page sequence="7">46 | Jadran Mimica as a narcissistic theatre of selective self-disclosure, a pseudo-drama of idealized balance of the 'truth' of one's own limitations and actualizations, but rather a means of creating more accurate knowledge. To be lucid about one's own limitations is a basic step. There is no epistemological and concrete empirical gain to be derived from it. The immediate step is to do something construc tively about one's defects. A person with a healthy narcissistic equilibrium will know what to do: swallow his/her self-idealization, suspend his/her delusory desire for omnipotence and omniscience, and proceed to do work on his/her deficiencies and see how far he/she will get in that regard. Concrete work is more likely to transform one's narcissistic desires, and in fact it does yield far more gratifying objects, since the project of ethnography is about concrete knowledge. And because narcissistic desire is inexhaustible, one will be able to draw on it to propel oneself into more action, whose aim is to conquer the problematic, resisting, and titillating object. It is better to make the limitations real than to make them a narcissistic object of one's own idealized self-repre sentations, which is what, more often than not, is managed in so many would be self-reflexive ethnographies. This is but a glossy metaphoric prop for the stage of self-representation. The 'critical' hyper-reflexivity evidenced in such writings is nothing else but the investigators' defensive self-consolidation within the shield of narcissistic self-mirroring, which systematically occludes the real flaws, that is, deficien cies, and the limitations in the dimension of concrete knowledge. The former purports to be the icing for the latter. An authentic, psychoanalytically guided reflective turn is an altogether different operation. In taking up psychoanalysis and phenomenology, one stands and falls by it, although not primarily through its application to others, but, firstly and recurrently, to oneself. What abounds in the purportedly self-reflective anthropological liturgy is an egoic circuity that I call 'reflexivity', with the x inflection, to emphasize the fixed, blind, or routin ized character of egoic self-regard, which, precisely because of its automatism and routinized 'strategic' (i.e., opportunistic) modes of being oneself, brings into the scope of consciousness only those aspects that cancel and/or inhibit further need for self-understanding or critical self-modification. Reflexivity is a closed-off circuit of the egoic self-regard determined by its own unpunctured narcissistic auto-scotoma. Two of its main qualities, cowardice and defensiveness, are projected as a higher (grandiose) morality. Reflection, on the other hand, is a penetrating and critical self-regard that, with each current of the inward turning, spreads deeper and deeper into the realms of the egoic self and attempts to comprehend its internal constitution. Relative to the intensity and depth of self-reflection, such circuity is bound to destabilize, at some stage, the egoic dimension of the self. Among other effects, this will cause depression, for it becomes evident that one is not exactly the kind of being that one aspired, and assumed oneself, to be. The narcissistic dynamics of these and other modes of the circuity of egoic self-regard, which now amounts to a struggle with the death instinct and a transformation of knowledge (Bion [1962] 1994, [1970] 1995) through the transformation of the capacity to love self and object in rela tion to the truth-driven will to knowledge, cannot be dealt with here. My point,</page><page sequence="8">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis \ 47 however, is that as an 'epistemophilic pursuit',6 the practice of self-reflectiv ity has to engender and to sustain systematically a genuine depressive posi tion, which alone will transform the practitioner into a mature epistemic—or, more accurately, gnostic—subject. To be sure, this practice of anthropological understanding through love and knowledge of humanity, the result of authentic ethnographic encounters, has nothing to do with the degradation of anthropol ogy and critical knowledge at large that is characteristic of current academic enterprise. Here, the managerial-performative online packaging of information deemed to be competitive and marketable has effectively reduced research to participation in seasonal grant applications, while the purpose of lecture courses is seen primarily as a means for the fee-paying students to get their degrees, that is, 'value' for money. The increasing effect is that institutional academic performance thinking makes both ignorance and knowledge approximate an equal degree of non-sense, fraudulence, and lack of accountability.7 Fueled by envy and arrogance, the currently dominant styles of performative thinking in anthropology have turned into a narcissistic mutilation of the extant diversity of human cultural life-worlds, as well as of knowledge and values created by past generations of scholars and thinkers, a veritable expression of the self-seeking global 'subjectivities'. Appropriately, these egoities advocate 'multi-sited field research' and write 'non-evidentiary' ethnographies. Ill Henri Michaux once remarked: "Rare indeed are madmen equal to madness." Similarly, it can be said: "Rare indeed are ethnographers equal to the human realities of the cultures they study." With respect to the ouroboric and related ontological underpinnings of New Guinea (and other) life-worlds (Mimica 1981, 1991), even the most sagacious ethnographers miss their significance, despite long periods of field research and the use of powerful conceptual frameworks, including psychoanalysis. This has to do with the fact that their use of psycho analysis lacks ontological grounding in the life-worlds that these ethnographers purport to interpret. For all Melanesian cultures, the cultural life-worlds are shaped to the posi tive realizations of the ontological phantasy of the psychic being, not just for its control, sublimation, attenuation, rationalization, or, say, transcendence. The Yagwoia life-world (or, for example, the Gimi of the Eastern Highlands) is not, to use Gillison's (1993) characterization, "between culture and fantasy." It is the life-made-culture, made so by the plenitude of desires of the human embodied un/conscious psyche, whose primordial project is its own self-projection into and actualization as phantasy-which-is-the-world. In this sense, culture is the fulfillment and affirmation of phantasy. These life-worlds articulate radical pas sions of the soul, not a middle position on existence, a neurotic self-compromise. Therefore, not being a collective existential mediocrity, New Guinea life-worlds demand from the ethnographer a total commitment to their truth, which is both phantasy and culture-as-reality. There is no 'between' for these people precisely</page><page sequence="9">48 | Jadran Mimica because their phantasy is constitutive of their vital, sexual-appetitive-aggressive cathexes of the world. Their libido is inseparable from their mortido. And as any New Guinea ethnographic corpus clearly shows, these life-worlds histori cally have had an absolutely total self-commitment to themselves, as a totality of life-and-death. Indeed, nothing less is to be expected from a humanness that practiced, among so many other formidable modes of autopoietic self-consum mation, exo- and endo-cannibalism, institutionalized male homosexuality, and headhunting, to mention only a few. In other words, all psychoanalytic (and ethnographic) interpretations are in need of a more thorough grounding in the given life-world subjectivities. There is always a problem of the choice of the psychoanalytic framework of understanding, the depth of the ethnographer's/psychoanalyst's self-reflection, and, correlatively, his/her ability and will to project him/herself imaginatively into the life-world of a particular people, who, most importantly, are neither good citizens nor citizen-subjects. The tacit and diverse ontologies of the Mela nesian egoity and sociality require that the ethnographer reflect critically on the cultural ontology of the human subject embedded in all psychoanalytic metapsychologies. Such a precaution will not only enhance the hermeneutic potential of psychoanalytic theories (Freudian, Kleinian, Lacanian, Kohut's self-psychology, Jungian, etc.), but also facilitate the construction of a cultur ally more adequate representation of a New Guinea (or any other) subjectivity and its life-world. This, in turn, will also appropriately modify a metapsycho logical scheme of understanding. The need for this kind of culturally specific hermeneutic grounding of psy choanalysis becomes evident when one tries to grasp the psycho-cultural logics of incest and their articulations in different life-worlds. One deals here with radically different constitutions and self-problematizations of 'family' or, better yet, societal complexes and the bisexual matrix of the human psychic being. From these follow all other ontological differences between the 'subject' as constructed by psychoanalytic metapsychologies, developed in concrete Occi dental social-cultural conditions of existence, and a particular constellation of New Guinea subjectivity and its cultural life-world. Let me expand on this by drawing on my work among the Yagwoia, since among them, as elsewhere in New Guinea (and in so many other life-worlds on this globe), the sphere of human egoity is constituted as that entity which is commonly rendered in ethnographic literature as the 'soul' (see Mimica 2003a). But here, it is deter mined consubstantially with human embodiment as a microcosmic realm that is intrinsically dependent on the macrocosmic world-body, the luno-solar ener gies, and other powers existing therein. In the Yagwoia life-world, all modalities of human experience and action belong to this macrocosmic existential totality. Here, the realm of the 'social' has no ontological privilege of being the arbiter of what is 'real' or 'socialized' and thus acceptable as such. The horizon of human experience in all its depths, heterogeneity, and intensity is conterminous with everything that there is—past, present, and future. Accordingly, the Yagwoia un/conscious is macrocosmic, and the realm of the 'social' is but the microcosmic, part = whole self-expression</page><page sequence="10">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis \ 49 of the macrocosmos.8 And qua dreaming, due to the wanderings of the human soul-component, which detaches when a person falls asleep (Mimica 2006), the physical exteriority of the Yagwoia world has a permanent constitutive determi nation in and of their living un/conscious, which, reciprocally, is continuously objectified in and qua the exteriority of the world. In the same process, the liv ing un/conscious is continuously open to somatization and socialization. Parenthetically, given the intensity of the Yagwoia cathexis of their world body and the ubiquity of its immanence in the un/conscious body-images of concrete individuals, it can be firmly said that their coenaestheses are saturated with the quiddity of the world-body as much as with their primary maternal embodiment. The two define one and the same primordial habitus of motility and sensibility. I am true to the facticity of the Yagwoia embodiment when I say that in their life-world insanity, which is a condition induced by spirits (not infrequently of the deceased maternal relatives), is as much a rupture of the somatized psyche as of the coenaesthetic image of its world. As for the 'social', it lives the life borrowed from the powers/energies of the psycho-soma, its imaginary, and the world, which is the immediate realm of the sensuous. It is more to the point to say that for so many modern and postmodern Western ers (but not for the Yagwoia), insanity is the unpalatable truth of the limita tions and idealizations of the parameters that define their sense of the normal human socius. By and large, the Western civic socius is at ease with neuroses of all sorts (they are the stuff of 'socialized emotion' and of egos well equipped with 'social skills'), but it cannot tolerate psychotic leakages and ruptures. In a life-world where spirits are as much a part of the 'natural' order of the day as pigs, marsupials, and humans themselves, 'psychoses' are nothing more than a commonly encountered 'social fact'.9 This brief sketch of the facticity of the Yagwoia life-world, with the accent on the oneiric mode of experience, makes it clear that, for the Yagwoia, their life-world is no less real in their dreaming than in their wakefulness. Corre spondingly, to know the Yagwoia life-world and themselves, as they are qua their experience and action, requires exploration of every mode of their experi ence and its articulations. Only through this total perspective can one come to understand the Yagwoia sense of reality and their modes of reality-appraisal and validation. Dreaming and dreams constitute the existential domain that can be entered into relatively easily. Through a long-term, systematic ethno graphic-psychoanalytic exploration, dreams will disclose the concrete dynamic configurations and cultural specificity of the un/conscious imaginary matrix of the Yagwoia life-world, at once personal and transpersonal. Every dream is an expression of this totalizing synthesis of the dreamer and his/her life situation, the life-world immanent in it as a whole, and identical to its living part = whole, the dreamer.10 The radical imaginary invoked here is, literally, the ontological source of all human reality (Castoriadis 1984, 1987),11 the creative matrix by virtue of which there is any given human cultural life-world. Furthermore, by studying the practice and intersubjective dynamics of mourn ing (Mimica 2006), the ethnographer comes to experience it as a process that, with singular force, realizes the Yagwoia life-world as an indissoluble socius of</page><page sequence="11">50 I Jadran Mimica the living and the dead. It is in this context that the ethnographer also comes to experience and appreciate the palpability of spirits as the real denizens of the Yagwoia world and, by the same token, is moved to explore more cogently the horizonal differentiation and delimitations of their experiential field, specifically in terms of the topographical implications of the notion of the un/conscious. In the life-world dimension of dream experience, the egoic self's noetic activity articulates itself without the willful interference of the wakeful self conscious and critical self-regard. To the extent that all Yagwoia dreams were reported to me (as they are among the Yagwoia) ex post facto, they still were the products of their sleeping egos and their internal objects. As such, they are the work of what I delineate as their un/conscious. I put it so precisely because the relation between consciousness and the un/conscious is subject to diverse articulations in different life-worlds. Experientially, their mutual articulation does not conform to a universal dimensional topography, principally in terms of a distinction between psychic interiority and exteriority. My use of the slash in 'un/conscious' indicates that there is no a priori assumption made as to how and in what mode, if at all, something is unconscious in a given field of experience.12 This calibration varies between individuals and life-worlds, and between different periods within one and the same life-world. In terms of the Yagwoia life-world-specific ontological underpinnings of their experiences and existence, the basic dimensionality of their 'I-ness', such as interiority/exteri ority and all its derivatives, is a radically different inner/outer field. Spirits no less than the soul, or any other presences experienced, for instance, in dreams, are not for the Yagwoia 'internal objects' composed of life-memories or arche typal images. These entities are either entirely autonomous (e.g., spirits) and external to a given 'I' (ego) or in a semi-detachable incorporative/excorporative relation with the body and 'I-ness', as, for instance, one's dream-soul compo nent (see Mimica 2003a, 2006, 2007a). The ego and its derivations, egoic, egoity, stress the primary, irreducible bodily sphere of the human experiential field and its constitution qua the dia lectics of the body ego (Fliess 1956, 1961) and its maternal envelopment (Klein [1932] 1988; Lacan 1977; Mahler, Pine, and Bergman [1975] 1985; Neumann 1954; Stern 1985). By a somewhat cumbersome phrase, 'egoic self, I specify the figure-ground dynamics within the embodied sphere of experience. Selfhood is the total dynamic ground of the psycho-soma vis-a-vis which the ego/I-ness is the figure subject to a myriad of fluctuating modalities of autoAallo-morphic dynamics (including autoAallo-centricity, autoAallo-recognition) and always in reciprocal formative relation to its total ground. When I write 'Self' with a capi tal S, I am referring to the realm of the radical, archetypal schemata of experi ence (Jung 1968a, 1968b), which in the Yagwoia life-world is objectified as the ouroboric Cosmic Self. This transpersonal Self is immanent in the egoic selfhood of every living and dead Yagwoia. This, in short, is the framework within which the Yagwoia sense of 'agency' can be adequately explored and interpreted. My published work provides ample ethnographic demonstration of this formula tion,13 and, accordingly, I can say that my psychoanalysis is phenomenologically grounded in the Yagwoia life-world. Their psychic being is accounted for with</page><page sequence="12">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis \ 51 a maximal fidelity to its life-world constitution. So although my use of notions such as 'un/conscious', 'egoic self', and 'internal objects' is within the frame work of psychoanalytic metapsychological conceptualization, this is done as an interpretive exercise that both maintains and amplifies the ontological original ity and existential integrity of the Yagwoia selfhood and life-world. More significantly, this approach also brings us most immediately into the sphere of the primary, constitutive somatic imagination of the Yagwoia embodiment, whereby its 'material' composition and quiddity of substance (that which we readily know and identify as flesh, tissue, organs, skin, bone, blood, and semen, or, more recently, as cells, genes, etc.) acquire their primary objectification.14 Organismic articulation of experience and cognition takes place in the mediation of bodily interiority and exteriority and the total trajec tory of bodily composition, growth, transformations (injuries, regrowth, etc.), and eventual disintegration (corpse fluids, disincarnation, etc.). This is the realm of concrete experience of some such categorical quiddity as 'substantial ity' of the human embodied self (its 'materiality', 'animatedness', etc.) and its concrete world (earth, stones, trees, mountains, sky, sun, moon, rain, rivers, etc.). Fundamentally, numerous modes of quiddity, haecceity, and seity of the world's 'matter' are shaped by the primary imaginary matrix of the synthesis of experience through which human embodiment, at once intersubjective and cosmicized, achieves and sustains its living objectivity. I should also add that this set of reflections on the macro/microcosmic dialectics of subjectivity and articulation of experience is one way of concret izing Leenhardt's (1979: 61) cosmo-poetic pronouncement that because "the native is filled with the world's pulse, he does not distinguish the world from his body." As for his view that the Melanesian is "unaware that the body is an element which he himself possesses" (ibid.: 32), all I can say is that, at its best, this would-be cosmo-ontological pronouncement is a piece of misleading rhetoric, exemplary of how one can go astray in an effort to do cosmo-poetic ethnography. One would have to ask how the Canaques perform such a hum ble, practical action as transporting themselves through their concrete world. If one takes Leenhardt at his word, it would follow that falling into a fire, hitting a stone, or getting injured would make no difference to the Canaques. If this were so, I do not think that any of them would live for too long. Leenhardt's concept of 'cosmomorphism', as opposed to 'anthropomorphism', is on closer scrutiny unsustainable, specifically in reference to the Canaques, although it has a reasonable coefficient of propaedeutic usefulness. More important, how ever, is to recognize that his ideas concerning the Melanesian experiential field are motivated by his own sublimated phantasies about the immanent depths of the human (or rather, Christian) psychic being.15 He had used naive psy chological theories whose empirical experiential content (be that imagination, perception, affectivity) was minimal. Accordingly, his intellectual constructions could proceed unobstructed, but at the price of unnecessary absurdities.16 Leenhardt's flaws are at once too fundamental and too serious to be com pounded with uncritical appreciation (e.g., Strathern 1988). Rather, one has to learn from his and Levy-Bruhl's errors by familiarizing oneself with thinkers</page><page sequence="13">52 | Jadran Mimica such as Cassirer, Freud, Jung, Melanie Klein, and Schilder, to name a few.17 They are also necessary for a critical appreciation of Heidegger's 'primordial understanding' and 'Dasein analysis', which some New Guinea ethnographers like to draw on.18 IV For a psychoanalytically grounded anthropologist, it is critical to conduct field work with a psychoanalytic self-application. But to be sure, exposure to ana lytic experience does not necessarily ensure a better grasp of psychoanalysis or human reality. The crucial problem is that very few anthropologists who use psychoanalysis do have an adequate understanding of the radical reality of the human psyche. (Nota bene: This is also a deficiency of Castoriadis, who vacillates in his conceptual apprehension of radical imagination or instituting imaginary. In this regard, Jung's analytics of the transpersonal, archetypal sphere of the human psyche is of critical relevance for the further development of psychoanalytic anthropology.) With or without a personal experience of psychoanalysis, there is often a pronounced and tedious dissonance between the ethnographic material and the ethnographer's interpretative commentaries. Every human life-world is a testimony to the radical reality and generativity of the human psyche—the ontological condition of the human existential matrix determined at once as the intersubjective social-cultural-historical realm and as the intra-subjective interiority and individuality. Anthropological interpretations, on the other hand, first and last reproduce unreflected-upon (mis-) conceptions of the ontological regions that are readily referred to by a battery of labels, such as 'social', 'cul tural', 'psychic', 'material', 'real', 'imaginary', 'symbolic', etc., all of which are usually welded into a very basic functionalist framework of understanding,19 but are masked by any number of coatings liberally splashed from the cans of the 'currently topical' theoretical discourses. Even in the most committed pursuits of psychoanalytic anthropology, psychoanalysis figures as a veneer rather than as the encompassing horizon of intelligibility and the uncompromisingly pen etrating illumination of human existence. Take, for instance, Juillerat's ([1986] 1996) uneasiness about his use of psychoanalysis;20 he appeals to Bastide as a support rather than, more appropriately, as a footnote to a critical construction and demonstration. Thus, Bastide (but not Juillerat) is reported to have "shown that psychoanalysing a culture is in no way tantamount to reducing the social to the psychic, but requires identifying 'transformation rules' which have enabled the psychic structure to reproduce itself in the sociocultural structure and con versely the latter to produce meaning in individual thought" (ibid.: 546). This rhetorical proclamation itself attests to the fact that Bastide himself is rather suspect as to achieving a lucid understanding of both the social and psychic, this being clearly indicated by the invocation of some such notions as 'transformational rules'. I am sure that he never identified any such rules, although he might have posited many of them, probably because he would not</page><page sequence="14">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis | 53 know any better how to deal with either the psychic or the social. Which is to say that in the hands of such a thinker, psychoanalysis has not come into its own as the basis of the interpretation of the psyche, intersubjectivity, and the creation of the specifically human reality circumscribed by Western notions such as social-cultural-historical. In short, like any framework of understand ing, psychoanalysis can be predominantly a gloss in a shaky edifice of concepts that primarily affirm the interpreter's worldview as an ideological form. Thus, psychoanalysis is brought in to consolidate the interpreter's defenses, self valuation, false self-idealizations, and unattended-to deficiencies, rather than to explore the psychic depths and qua them the self-formations of human life worlds. Reciprocally, this would enrich and transform the ethnographer's quest for the understanding of a specific life-world and for the reconstruction of anthropology, especially in the present moment of its institutional (academic) disintegration in which thinking is dominated by a lethal atrophy of human spirit, as evinced by the overwhelming conformism and 'omn/i/mpotence'21 of thought among those who practice it primarily as a vehicle for their career bound self-realization in the context of that social institution whose object was creation and cultivation of critical knowledge and, by means of such knowl edge, action in the social world. Needless to say, this institution (the univer sity) has collapsed, primarily due to the cowardice and opportunism of those who make a living out of it. Psychoanalysis is as old as the last century, and so virtually is its pursuit in anthropology. The fundamental entailments of psychoanalytic ethnogra phy and the rigors it demands were explicated a long time ago by Devereux (1967), but primordially they were set forth by that great Pythian dictum, 'know thyself. It applies to the pursuit of the ethnographic project regardless of one's acceptance or rejection of psychoanalysis. Crucial to the integrity of the ethnographic project, with or without psychoanalysis, is the construction and practice of anthropological understanding. This is the medium of increas ingly conceptually deficient but conceited discourses spun by the professional fraternities/sororities who inhabit Western metropolitan academic institutions. In regard to this terminal station, one has to be aware that these discourses themselves are the products of the Western civic un/conscious and its cultur ally and historically specific modes of objectifications, in the form of 'critical' knowledge and moral-aesthetic styles of self-presentation. What starts off as a local fieldwork situation, determined by an alien existential milieu and un/ conscious matrix, becomes refracted and metabolized in a psychic medium and sphere of critical-theoretical understanding that caters to and is driven and determined by egoities external to this or that originary life-world, which is also their transpersonal, cultural-historical objectified psyche. The accomplishments of ethnography as an epistemic project always balance precariously on the relations between some such two (or more) life-worlds, coalescing in the egoity and the un/conscious, at once personal and transper sonal, of the ethnographer. In this perspective, most ethnographers' ethnographic scales tilt heavily on the side of their academic sphere of self-synthesis qua understanding, rather than on the side of the life-worlds that they write about.</page><page sequence="15">54 | Jadran Mimica To achieve the latter does not mean that the ethnographer would have to become 'one of them'—that is, the people s/he has worked with—or to abandon the perspective of a critical-theoretical self-un/consciousness. Rather, it is a matter of a self-critical and self-reflective exercise for which the basic tenets of classical ethnography and psychoanalysis are more than enough to serve the purpose of methodical guidance. There is no need for the hyper-reflexive bravado that has been in vogue since the inception of postmodern anthropological styles of self presentation. Every productive ethnographic interpretive process hinges criti cally on the psychoanalytical self-regard of the interpreter him/herself (Devereux 1967; Mimica 2001) and is not carried out for the sake of reproducing a concep tual framework that quickly calcifies into a formulaic application exercise, deter mined by his/her own situation, external to the life-world under scrutiny. The second-order formulaic amplifications are at best that—auxiliary amplifications. They cannot carry the crucial work of self-critical analysis, being a work in the service of elucidating an alien cultural life-world in its own terms. Echoing the dramaturgical perspective, for an ethnographer, the perennial task is to seek the truth of his/her characters in the facticity of their own self creation and self-interpretation. In this regard, the characters have to be bespo ken, refracted, and resynthesized from inside themselves, in their own terms. The ethnographer is the medium of their maximally actualized self-semblance. Neither the ethnographer-dramatist nor the characters themselves may like the emergent self-semblance. But then, who is ready to claim as their own the whole of their own self, sired by critical self-knowledge, rather than glimpsed in that primordial twinkle of maternal eyes that intimate the promise of infinite bliss and perfection, but at the price of narcissistic misrecognition and self ignorance? Psychoanalytic ethnographers, I expect. Acknowledgments This is an extract from a longer work on anthropology and epistemological issues. It comprises three parts, of which the first will appear as a separate article. The bulk of the present article comprises the second part of the original, in combination with several sections from the other two. Much-abridged versions of the first and the sec ond parts were presented at the Lisbon and St Andrews symposia on anthropology and epistemology held in late September 2007.1 am grateful to the participants for their comments, especially Christina Toren, Peter Gow, and Marcio Goldman. Jadran Mimica is a Senior Lecturer in Anthropology at the University of Sydney. He has carried out long-term field research among the Yagwoia-Angan people of Papua New Guinea over a period of three decades. His most recent publications include "Descended from the Celestial Rope: From the Father to the Son, and from the Ego to the Cosmic Self" (2007) and "Mother's Umbilicus and Father's Spirit: The Dialectics of Selfhood of a Yagwoia Transgendered Person" (2008).</page><page sequence="16">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis | 55 Notes 1. I explain below the reason for writing 'un/conscious' with a slash. 2. Here, self-knowledge is extended to include one's own cultural life-world, especially within the historical horizon of its own critical self-interpretation. 3. In order to get a better picture of Levi-Strauss as an ethnographer, one should read his 1936 essay, "Contribution a 1'etude de l'organisation sociale des Indiens Bororo" and his 1948 monograph, La vie familiale et sociale des Indiens Nambikwara. His English-lan guage contributions in the famous Handbook of South American Indians (vol. 3, 1948) on the Nambikuara, Tupi-Cawahib, the tribes of the upper Xingu River, and on the use of wild plants in tropical South America, as well as two papers (one on the social use of kin ship terms among Brazilian Indians, the other on Nambikwara chieftainship) supplement his strictly ethnographic writings. According to Peter Gow (personal communication, St Andrews, September 2007), when the famous German-Brazilian ethnographer Curt Nimuendaju was asked to recommend an able anthropologist for the job of a full-time ethnographer of Brazilian Indians (which is what he himself did), his choice was Levi Strauss. Nimuendaju characterized him "as an outstanding young French anthropologist, eminently suitable for the task." Many years later, Levi-Strauss made the following assess ment of himself as an ethnographer: "Finally, why not admit it? I realized early on that I was a library man, not a fieldworker. I don't mean this disparagingly, quite the contrary, but fieldwork is a kind of 'women's work' (which is probably why women are successful at it). Myself, I had neither the interest nor the patience for it" (in Eribon 1991: 44). 4. Castoriadis's views have to be clarified with respect to his specific philosophical and psy choanalytic synthesis of understanding (i.e., his ideas and their conceptual articulation). He is a thinker who indeed thinks for himself within the Western philosophical tradi tion, which he knows very well. But precisely as such he has to be critically elucidated in relation to that tradition, and especially in relation to the field of psychoanalytic and ethnographic evidence. 5. In my formulations, narcissistic dynamics is not separable from the dynamics of instinc tual drives. The archaic nucleus of the latter is what 1 call 'oral-ocular', indicating the immanent synthesis of narcissistic dynamics and the primordial sucking-digestive-grop ing instinctual self-circuity. This is the core of the primal ideal-ego and the super-ego (well illustrated by Malinowski's self-account cited above). 6. The Kleinian concept 'epistemophilic pursuit' (Klein [1932] 1988) refers to 'love of knowl edge', echoing directly the notion of 'desire for knowledge'. Although a commonplace expression belonging to the classical matrix of Western philosophy, this determination of knowing as driven by desire requires that it be explored and elucidated psychoanalytically. My brief discussion draws on Klein (ibid.) and Bion ([1962] 1994, [1970] 1995), whose work enriches the understanding of the psychic realities implied by this commonplace notion. 7. 1 am drawing primarily, although not exclusively, on my experience of Australian uni versities. However, I should stress that the antipodean academe is in the avant-garde of the managerialization of universities and the concomitant degradation of research and critical thought that is traditionally associated with these institutions. 8. On the phenomenological problematics of ontological differentiation of the world, includ ing the realm of the 'social', see James ([1890] 1950: 2:21), Schutz (1962), Gurwitsch (1964: pt. 6), and Luckmann (1970). Wallace's (1959) paper is a classical positing of the same problematics from within the conceptual parameters of anthropological inquiry. With regard to the part = whole relation, it is the dominant mode of part&gt; &lt; whole dynamics in the Yagwoia universe (see, e.g., Mimica 1988), which is to say that, in their realm, the world is a holographic totality. For an elaboration of holographic worldviews as characteristic of New Guinea life-worlds, see Wagner (2001). 9. For the aesthesiological structuration of embodiment, see Husserl (1989), Schilder (1950, 1951), and Merleau-Ponty (1962). See also Scott (1948), Winnicott (1958), and McDou gall (1989).</page><page sequence="17">56 | Jadran Mimica 10. I take this as the universally valid perspective. An excellent illustration of this can be found in Beradt (1968). See also Binswanger (1963). 11. The radical imaginary discussed here is not to be mistaken for Lacan's imaginary, despite the fact that the condition for the latter is the matrix of the radical imaginary. See Cas toriadis (1984: 46-115) for a critique of Lacan and his concept of imaginary. Although an astute discussion, Castoriadis's critique does not diminish the general importance of Lacan's concept for the elucidation of the psychic being and human reality. Corbin's (1969, 1972) concept of mundus imaginalis, or the 'imaginal', is also relevant in this context; however, given the brevity of this discussion, 1 will refrain from carrying out a more sustained critical clarification. The same holds true of Durand's ([1964] 1999, 1971) great work. 12. This fundamental caution was stressed a long time ago by Leach (1958). Similarly, Lienhardt (1961) observed about the Dinka that they "have no conception which at all closely corresponds to our popular modern conception of the 'mind' as mediating and, as it were, storing up the experiences of the self" (ibid.: 149). In an accompanying note, Lienhardt stated further: "And still less of conscious and unconscious elements, of course" (ibid.: 149nl; emphasis added). The reader would profit from reading the rest of the paragraph from this great ethnography. 13. For concrete ethnographic demonstrations, see Mimica (2006, 2007a, forthcoming). 14. For further elaboration on the problematics of ontological categories such as 'matter', 'bodily substances', 'spirit', and 'soul', see Mimica (2003a: 262-265, 274-277). 15. In order to elucidate critically, that is, psychoanalytically, the transferential-countertrans ferential context of Leenhardt's interpretations of the Canaques' life-world, I would have to examine in some detail his relation with his informants, principally his eldest convert Boesoou Erijisi. Leenhardt wrote about him: "(His) Christianity is no way an imitation of the white; it is lived, and it is the Christianity of a pure Canaque ... Everything that I have been permitted to clarify in the obscurity of native questions I owe to Boesoou" (cited in Clifford 1981: 141-142). 16. I should say that this also applies to more recent anthropological importations into Mela nesian life-worlds of concepts (and their concomitant absurdities) such as Strathern's (1988, via McKim Marriott), notion of 'dividual' and Gell's (1998) 'distributed person'. Never mind for a moment the theory of 'agency', these concepts are supposed to capture an authentic sense of Melanesian personhood, as opposed to Western notions such as 'individual' or, indeed, the psychoanalytic 'ego' or 'egoic self', all of which are assumed to be supposedly a-relational entities. By the same token, these authors and their numer ous followers have nothing to say about whether their constructions do in any way have some basis in the constitutive-constructive dynamics of the human psyche and lived embodiment, be that in the experiences of the alleged Melanesian (or Indian) 'dividuals' or Western self-centered 'individuals'. It is worthwhile pointing out that a version of the idea of a 'dividual' was presented by von Bertalanffy ([1952] 1960: 48-50) in his remark able comments on what constitutes an individual in unicellular organisms and primitive animals such as hydra and turbellarian worm. See also Koestler (1967: 59-70, who had expanded on and popularized von Bertalanffy's discussion. Contemplating such primi tive life forms and their life cycles stimulates theories about the ontology of individuality and multiplicity and the dialectics of one-and-the-many. It also prompts reflections on the dynamics of human egoity and its social matrix in any life-world, past or present. 17. To this list of thinkers should be added Heinz Werner, Bernard Kaplan, and Silvano Arieti. 18. For a critical perspective on Heidegger in anthropology, see Mimica (1993) and Weiner (2001). 19. Now more than ever, it is evident that most anthropologists never mastered Levi-Strauss's structuralist thought, let alone tried to emulate his power of imagination to feel and liter ally discern generative, pattern-creating dynamics in human life-worlds. 20. It should be acknowledged that this was an earlier work on the Yafar translated into English 10 years after the original French edition. Subsequently, Juillerat published two</page><page sequence="18">Phenomenological Psychoanalysis | 57 other psychoanalytic ethnographies of the Yafar (1991, 1995) and a volume of essays on psychoanalytic anthropology (2001). 21. I use the term 'omn/i/mpotence' to designate the economy of the archaic narcissistic equi librium in which, due to its extreme mirror-schizoid bivalency, symbiotic omnipotence and impotence are equipollent and conterminous (see Mimica 2003b: 27).
