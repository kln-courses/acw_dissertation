<plain_text><page sequence="1">PARADISE REGAINED: THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN MILTON John I. Ades The Prince of princes himself, when here, went through this town to his own country, and that upon a fair day too; yea, and as I think, it was Beelzebub, the chief lord of the fair, that invited him to buy of his vanities; yea, would have made him lord of the fair, would he but have done him reverence. . . . Beelzebub had him from street to street, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a little time, that he might, if possible, allure the Blessed One to cheapen and buy some of his vanities; but he had no mind to the merchandise, and therefore left the town, without laying out so much as one farthing upon these vanities. - The Pilgrim's Progress I My subject is John Milton's use of Luke 4:1-13 in his brief epic, Paradise Regained, as an illustration of the way a Renaissance Christian humanist poet finds breadth and depth of meaning in a spare but suggestive biblical text.* It has always seemed to me that the techniques of literary criticism are of great use to the biblical scholar, especially when he is also a teacher at the university level. Thus I ask my students to join me in using the same optic on the Bible that we would employ for any other literary text of antiquity: the Iliad, the Aeneid, the Oresteia, Augustine's Confessions . Granting that Scripture is cer- tainly much more than literature, still, on a significant level, much of it is literature, yielding richness of meaning to consideration of such literary critical matters as setting, sequence, recurrent image, structure, rhythm, jux- taposition, framing, &amp;c., and of course to more comprehensive critical modes: myth, genre, and typology. If the form critics of the Bible often left the impression that the evangelists were a species of scissors and paste editors, the redaction and composition critics have rightly insisted that they were often original creative artists in their own right. When, for example, I note in Mark's Gospel that the three predictions of the Passion are intertwined with Peter's Confession and the mystical Transfiguration vision, the whole sequence introduced by the healing of the blind man at Bethsaida (Mark 8:22-26) and concluded by the healing of blind 74</page><page sequence="2">Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46-52) as Jesus and the Disciples approach Jerusalem, I figure that Mark is saying something about two kinds of blindness and two kinds of sight. Just as surely as Sophocles is weaving a blindness/sight/insight pattern in Oedipus Tyrannos. Just as surely as is Shakespeare when he has Othello, about to slay Desdemona in her bedchamber, utter his heart- breaking ambiguity about light: Put out the light, and then put out the light: If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore, . . . but once put out thy light, I know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume. (V. ii. 7-13) II For his three major poems at the end of his life, Milton turned to biblical subjects. In Paradise Lost and Samson Agonistes , he used, respectively, the Old Testament texts of Genesis 3 and Judges 13-16, leaving Paradise Regain- ed his sole substantial poetic treatment of a New Testament text. But in neither of the former two did he approach the biblical material in the ex- egetical manner of Paradise Regained . To be sure, years earlier, in his twen- ties, he had written a beautiful shorter poem "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity," and he had also, as we would expect, attempted a poem on the Crucifixion. But in the latter he produced eight stanzas of a work, "The Pas- sion," which he was unable to complete. One stanza of the eight will show that he ran into the ditch of untemperable emotion: Mine eye hath found that sad Sepulchral rock That was the Casket of Heav'n's richest store, And here though grief my feeble hands up-lock, Yet on the soft'ned Quarry would I score My plaining verse as lively as before; For sure so well instructed are my tears, That they would fitly fall in order'd Characters.1 He obviously could not reduce such personal grief to artistic order, and he charmingly appended a note to that effect: "This subject the Author finding to be above the years he had, when he wrote it, and nothing satisfied with what was begun, left it unfinisht." He never returned to it. Such extravagant conceits, were, of course, the fashion; and Milton's contemporary, Crashaw, did not leave his poem, "To the Infant Martyrs," "unfinisht," concluding with advice to his nurslings, "Nor let the milky fonts that bathe your thirst/ 75</page><page sequence="3">Be your delay;/The place that calls you hence is, at the worst, /Milk all the way." Milton's choice of the pericope of the Temptation in Luke's Gospel as the primary source for his sole major poem on a New Testament subject is in- teresting to speculate about. A perhaps apocryphal reason is that given by his friend and sometime student, Thomas Ellwood, who, returning the manuscript of Paradise Lost and being asked how he liked it, tells us he replied: 4 Thou has said much here of Paradise Lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise Found?"2 That's a little too pat, but it does draw attention to the fact that Paradise Lost , Paradise Regained , and Samson Agonistes, in se- quence, do form a complete and searching view of human experience. In Paradise Lost we see man tempted, unable (or unwilling) to stand, and thus fallen from timeless innocence into the world of mutability. But already in Paradise Lost further treatment is explicitly projected. In the invocation to Book I, we read that Eden will be lost 4 'Till one greater Man/ Restore us, and regain the blissful seat" (4-5). And at the end of Book XII of Paradise Lost , Michael prophesies to Adam that 44Not Moses . . . / But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call . . . / Shall quell the adversary" (307-12). 44Not by destroy- ing Satan," he continues, 44but by fulfilling/ That which thou didst want, obedience" (394-97). In Paradise Regained , then, we see Jesus (as much man as Milton could make the Son of God, of which more later) exactly fulfilling this prophecy, quelling Satan by obedience to the will of God in the Temptation sequence. Where the first Adam fell, Jesus, the last Adam, stood. In Samson Agonistes (to fill out the picture), we see Milton expanding the Judges text to show Samson, first tempted by his father, Manoa, then by the wiles of Dalila and the Philistines, then by a blustering giant, Harapha (whom Milton, departing from the Judges text, altogether invents), all of which pro- duce blindness and bondage. But suddenly and miraculously he rises to over- come the temptation to despair, obey the will of God, and destroy the Philistines and their temple to Dagon - but at the sacrificial cost of his own life. O dearly bought revenge yet glorious [hymns the Chorus] Living or dying thou hast fulfill' d The work for which thou wast foretold To Israel , and now li'st victorious Among thy slain self-kill'd Not willingly, but tangl'd in the fold Of dire necessity, whose law in death conjoin' d Thee with thy slaughter' d foes in number more Than all thy life had slain before. (1660-1668) It is easy to see, then, how neatly Milton's choice of the Gospel Tempta- tion incident for Paradise Regained fits into the grand sweep of his major 76</page><page sequence="4">biblical poems, all of which center on temptation. And the point may be driven home by attending to mediaeval and Reformation (and even earlier Christian) traditions of seeing both the parallels between the temptations of Adam and Jesus, as well as the allegorization of Samson into a hero, a saint, a martyr, and a counterpart of Jesus (as seen in the implications of the epithet Milton gives him: icU ). My late-lamented friend and teacher, Michael Krouse, drawing on Elizabeth Pope's study of Paradise Regained : the Tradition and the Poem , summarized in his book, Milton's Samson and the Christian Tradition , the ex- egetical situation Milton received: By the time of Milton, the distinction among the several kinds of temptation was fully and clearly developed. Seventeenth-century theologians conceived of three separate temptations: con- cupiscentia carnis . . . figuratively designated as 4 'the flesh"; con- cupiscentia oculorum . . . known figuratively as "the world"; and superbia vitae . . . figuratively "The Devil." [In Protestant theology the three temptations became, respectively, necessity , fraud (or persuasion), and violence .] According to this scheme, Satan had tempted Man by necessity when he argued the fruit was edible and needed as food; by fraud (or persuasion) when he used flattery and lied about the results which would follow upon eating; and by violence or fear when he spoke threateningly about death and represented the fruit as a means of attaining God-like deathlessness. Satan's temptation of Christ in the wilderness was analyzed according to this same scheme: the temptation to turn stones into bread was necessity, the temptation of the kingdom was fraud (or persuasion); and the temptation of the tower was violence or fear.3 The combination, then, of Milton's forecast of Paradise Regained in Paradise Lost and the elaborate exegetical tradition of parallels between the temptations of Adam and Jesus clearly brought him to the Gospel account of that event, above all other New Testament possibilities, for the subject of his poem. But beneath these reasons also lay an autobiographical one: Milton's life- long preoccupation with the moral problem of temptation. In several of his sonnets, in his highly personal Latin Elegies, in his mask Comus (a drama about the temptation of The Lady), above all, in Areopagitica, his eloquent defense of freedom of the press, he insisted on the necessity of temptation as a means of proving virtue: he who can front temptation "and yet abstain,... he is the true warfaring Christian." I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for, 77</page><page sequence="5">not without dust and heat. . . . That virtue therefore which is but a youngling in the contemplation of evil, and knows not the ut- most that vice promises to her followers, and rejects it, is but a blank virtue, not a pure; her whiteness is but an excremental whiteness; which was the reason why our sage and serious poet Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas, describing true temperance under the person of Guyon, brings him in with his palmer through the cave of Mammon and the bower of earthly bliss, that he might see and know, and yet abstain.4 One can imagine how Milton would have snorted at what he would have considered the gloss the New English Bible offers as the translation of Mat- thew 6:13a: "And do not bring us to the tesť' (ć ¡s TttfaMov). A combination, then, of received tradition and personal attachment brought Milton to the Temptation of Jesus as the subject for his poem. The pattern of the Christian hero is on his mind. His model in terms of literary genre, as he tells us in The Reason of Church Government , is the brief epic, best exemplified by the Book of Job - as opposed to the diffuse epics of Homer, Vergil, Tasso, and his own Paradise Lost.5 In Job he saw the pattern of a hero's confronting a central problem, the presentation worked out dramatically in a series of speeches connected by narrative links and conclud- ed by a miraculous denouement. In Paradise Regained we see just such a pat- tern already implicit in the Gospel incident. Milton goes out of his way to em- phasize the human aspect of the Son of God, a universal man who is also a divine being. As the poem opens, Jesus comes "from Nazareth the son of Joseph deem'd . . ./ Obscure, unmarkt, unknown"; and at the end of the poem, "hee unobserv'd/ Home to his Mother's house private return'd." (Compare Luke 4:14a: "Then Jesus, armed with the Power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee.")6 This human emphasis allows Milton to give to the ac- tion of the poem the necessary ingredient of existential drama. But both the Book of Job and the temptation in Paradise Regained culminate in the miraculous, attesting that the divine is somehow always capable of manifesting itself in the human - or that the divine is always capable of being conceived in anthropomorphic terms. In Anatomy of Criticism , Northrop Frye declares that "between religion's 'this is' and poetry's 'but suppose this is,' there must always be some kind of tension, until the possible and the ac- tual meet at infinity€"7 III The Temptation of Jesus is narrated in both Matthew and Luke but receives only a two-verse summary in Mark. (It is entirely absent from John's Gospel.) The context is the same in all three: following the Baptism, when God declares of Jesus: "This is my Son," whereupon Jesus is led to the Wilderness. Milton fleshes out this bare report by having both Satan and 78</page><page sequence="6">Jesus indulge in long reflective passages in which each considers precisely what God's declaration about sonship means. Satan says he is not sure who this "obscure, unmarkt" person is, nor is Jesus clear about his own identity. Clearing up this problem becomes a major plot line of the poem, as it is by implication in the Gospel account. In the encounter with Satan, Milton chooses to follow the order of Luke rather than that of Matthew. The significant difference is that where Mat- thew gives the order of temptations as bread-tower-kingdoms, Luke reverses the last two, giving us bread-kingdoms-tower. It is easy to argue that Milton prefers Luke's order simply on dramatic grounds.8 Not only does the violence of the temptation of the tower make it a natural climax of action, not only does it represent the devil as nearly stymied and driven to cunning extremity ("Satan now/ Quite at a loss, for all his darts were spent,/ Thus to our Savior,.../ What does thou in this World?" [PR, IV, 365ff.]), but the temptation of the tower also provides a dilemma from which Jesus can only be released by a miracle (i.e., the angels must rescue him, a detail that is men- tioned in all three synoptics, but is narrated only in Matthew and Mark). A writer like Milton, bent on drama, could easily see that after this miracle there is no further logical action possible, and order the temptations accord- ingly - as Luke did, assuming, as is widely held, that Matthew's order is the more original.9 There are clear suggestions in Luke's text that invite the reader to consider the incident as having broader implications than a mere wilderness report. It is, after all, the culminating event of Jesus' preparation for his ministry, it im- mediately follows his baptism as Son of God, its wilderness setting introduces the motif of aloneness which is repeated on the Mount of Olives and at Peter's denial, and it clearly indicates (in the tradition already noted) that obedience to the will of God may cost everything the world has to offer. But most striking in broader implication are the three replies of Jesus to the devil's offers, all of which come from the early part of the Second Address of Moses in Deuteronomy, in which he lays before the wandering Israelites the statutes and ordinances of God by which they are to regulate their lives as a Chosen People.10 Any reader of the Gospel is expected to see that the Deuteronomy references insist on parallels between Jesus' experience in the wilderness and that of the Israelites during the Exodus. The temptation to turn stones into bread narrows Israel down to the Son, and shows that if Israel had been allowed to hunger, should not the Son do the same? The temptation of the kingdoms of the world, as Albright puts it, shows the struggle between obedience to "divine imperative" and "secular calculation," a struggle resolved only in submission to divine will.11 And the temptation of the pinnacle of the Temple draws a parallel between Israel's presumption as a Chosen People and the constant temptation in Jesus' ministry to presume on his Sonship to perform miracles. From all these traditions, Milton shapes his treatment of the Gospel inci- dent. His main emphases show him extending tradition by pressing and elaborating two elements he perceived in Luke's account: first, the drama in- 79</page><page sequence="7">herent in the Gospel text, which he was prepared to accentuate in his "brief epic" genre so as to achieve the universality of art - what Matthew Arnold called, in an old-fashioned phrase, "a criticism of life"; and second, the complexity of the devil's attempt to beguile Jesus by showing him "all kingdoms of the world in a moment of time" (Luke 4:5), which justified Milton's summoning all the classical and Renaissance lore he could muster to secure the copia appropriate to the "brief epic" genre, yet still keep within the rhetorical boundaries set by the spare Gospel text. To these ends, Milton enlarges, rearranges, and invents; but he never, so far as I can see, strays out- side the implications of Luke's account. In the remainder of this paper. I want to discuss these two elaborations taking that of the kingdoms first. IV The Gospel account gives Milton clear authority for expansion, for in it the devil says: "To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will" (Luke 4:6). Milton's Satan first offers Jesus riches beyond measure and fame beyond report; and then, as Jesus refuses at each juncture, in dizzying succession, he offers a David-like Messiahship, the spectacular power of the Roman Empire - "wide do- main/In ample Territory, wealth and power,/ Civility of Manners, Arts, and Arms" (PR, IV, 81ff.), noting coyly that Tiberius has no son to succeed him - ; and finally his trump card, the grand intellectual achievement of Greece - drama, poetry, oratory, sculpture, and above all, philosophy, in- stancing Epicureans, stoics, skeptics, Plato, Aristotle, and culminating with the quintessential figure, Socrates. But Jesus' reply is firm and unequivocal: Think not but that I know these things; or think I know them not; not therefore am I short Of knowing what I ought: he who receives Light from above, from the fountain of light, No other doctrine needs, though granted true. (PR, IV, 286-90) Jesus goes on to declare that if he should indulge in music or poetry, he would choose the highest, Hebrew, since, he says, "Greece from us these arts deriv'd."12 And here the voice of Jesus rises from the calm firmness of the Gospel figure to what sounds suspiciously like the curled lip of the English Puritan: They loudest sing The vices of thir Deities, and thir own In Fable, Hymn, or Song, so personating Thir Gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. 80</page><page sequence="8">Remove their swelling Epithets thick laid As varnish on a Harlot's cheek, the rest, Thin sown with aught of profit or delight, Will far be found unworthy to compare With Sion's songs, to all true tastes excelling, Where God is prais'd aright. . . . [adding] Thir Orators ... to our Prophets, far beneath. (PR, IV, 339-56) The tone of voice, as I have said, may be Milton's but the views are perfectly appropriate for the hero of his poem: the first -century Jesus of Luke's Gospel. What is particularly touching is that it must have cost Milton dearly to write those lines. But he keeps the drama of his poem consonant with Luke's Gospel by paying the price of having Jesus turn with contempt and rend the main roots of Milton's beloved Renaissance humanism. Surely Jesus' "though granted true" betrays more than a trace of Milton's personal regret. Nevertheless, the speech conforms to a hierarchy of values in which even Plato and Socrates fall short of true enlightenment and must be re- jected. The peculiar combination here of autobiography and exegesis thus brought to bear on the spare Lukan text make Milton's Temptation of the Kingdoms remarkable both for its high art and its imaginative understanding of a biblical text. Finally, the second of Milton's emphases: his accentuation of the Gospel drama appropriate to the epic genre. It is in this that Milton takes greatest liberties with the Gospel text. I have already remarked that Milton's choice of Luke's order-bread/kingdom/tower - is made for inherent dramatic pur- poses. Besides this choice, certain additions enhance the drama. He invents two scenes in Heaven: one in which God, carrying over his character from Paradise Lost, explains to Gabriel that He means to deliberately expose Jesus to the wiles of Satan in the wilderness, an echo of the opening of the Book of Job. Gabriel, this day by proof thou shalt behold, . . . this man born and now upgrown, To show him worthy of his birth divine And high prediction, henceforth I expose To Satan; let him tempt and now assay His utmost subtlety, because he boasts And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng Of His Apostasy; he might have learnt Less overweening, since he fail' d in Job, Whose contant perseverance overcame Whate'er his cruel malice could invent. 81</page><page sequence="9">He now shall know I can produce a man Of female Seed, far abler to resist All his solicitations, and at length All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell, Winning by Conquest what the first man lost By fallacy surpris'd. But first I mean To exercise him in the Wilderness. ( PR I, 130-156) And at the end of the poem, we return to Heaven for a second scene, a chorus of praise for Jesus' victory: True image of the Father, whether thron' d In the bosom of bliss, and light of light Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin'd In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, Wand'ring the Wilderness, whatever place, Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing The Son of God, with God-like force endu'd Against th' Attempter of thy Father's Throne And Thief of Paradise . . . . . now thou hast aveng'd Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing Temptation, hast regain'd lost Paradise. (PR IV, 596-608) Milton also has Satan invent a sumptuous banquet, designed to extend the implications of mere bread to gustatory munificence: Our Savior lifting up his eyes beheld A Table richly spread, in regal mode, With dishes pil'd, and meats of noblest sort And savor, Breasts of chase, or Fowl of game, In pastry built, or from the spit, or boil'd, Grisamber stream'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore, Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, And exquisitest name, for which was drain'd Pont us and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. And at a stately sideboard by the wine That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hue Than Ganymede or Hylas; distant more 82</page><page sequence="10">Under the Trees now tripp'd, now solemn stood Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that seem' d Fairer than feign'd of old, or fabl'd since Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore. (PR II, 338-61) Another addition to the Gospel text for dramatic effect is a scene in which Satan exposes Jesus to a fearful storm, a prologue, so to speak, to the violence of the Temptation of the Tower, by which Satan hopes to force Jesus to capitulate in sheer terror: And either Tropic now 'Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav'n; the Clouds From many a horrid rift abortive pour' d Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire In ruin reconciFd: nor slept the winds Within thir stony caves, but rush'd abroad From the four hinges of the world, and fell On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines, Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks Bow'd thir Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then, O patient Son of God, yet only stood' st Unshaken; Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round Ehviron'd thee, some howl'd, some yell'd, some shriek'd, Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while thou Satťst unappall'd in calm and sinless peace.13 (PR IV, 409-25) The storm avails Satan nothing, for when he returns next morning to taunt Jesus with the equivalent of, "All right! How did you like that!?" Jesus, in a rare moment of Miltonie humor, after all that weather, replies: "Mee worse than wet thou findest not" (PR IV, 486). In the three received temptations, as well as in the two Milton supplies, Satan is thus given depth of character, being variously a beggar, a courtier, a consummate rhetorician, a fiend, a bully - even a psychologist. When he seeks advice from his fellow fallen angels on how to proceed after Jesus re- jects his first temptation, Belial proposes salaciously: "Set women in his eye and in his walk," for they "draw/ Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous 83</page><page sequence="11">nets. . . ./ Women, when nothing else, beguiPd the heart/ Of wisest Solomon" (PR II, 153-69). To which Satan sneers: "In much uneven scale thou weigh'st/ All other by thyself' (PR, II, 173ff), instancing how neither Alexander nor Scipio Africanus was susceptible to the influence of women, and how Solomon, who was , is too worldly to compare with Jesus: How many have with a smile made small account Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd Remember that Pellean Conqueror, A youth, how all the Beauties of the East He slightly view'd, and slightly overpass'd; How hee surnam'd of Africa dismiss' d In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. For Solomon, he liv' d at ease, and full Of honor, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond Higher design than to enjoy his State; Thence to the bait of Women lay expos'd. (PR, II, 193-204) The heightening of character and plot, then, contribute to the inherent drama of Milton's treatment. And although Jesus' replies can have a tone of aggressive roundness, he must, and does, confidently refuse all Satan's offers. Later in his ministry, as Northrop Frye observes, Jesus will show no hesitation in many miraculous acts: but here he has not yet entered on his ministry- as if to say that before he does, he must reject and repudiate all worldliness. Satan gets all the atten- tion from his energy and ingenuity, while Jesus, Frye remarks, "sits mo- tionless, unmoved- an undramatic 'No' in the center." But of course the truth is just the opposite: truth lies in the apparently undramatic obedience to the will of God. "One would think," continues Frye, "that Milton had selected the Temptation episode because it is, with the possible exception of the agony in the Garden, the only episode in which suspense and the feeling of the possible awful consequences of failure are consistently present."14 A further range of the drama Milton develops here is his emphasis on the human situation of Jesus. Milton frames his plot as a journey of Jesus, start- ing from his home in Nazareth and returning "to his Mother's house." He also borrows from John's Gospel the association of Andrew and Simon with the Baptism of Jesus, for he then invents a scene in which Andrew and Simon miss Jesus during the 40-day absence and wonder "whither is he gone, what accident/Hath rapt him from us?" (PR, II, 39f.). They believe he is Messiah (as is typical of John's Gospel, against the synoptics), but ponder whether he will disappear now, as Elijah "on fiery wheels/Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come" (PR, II, 16f.). But they conclude that "soon we shall see our 84</page><page sequence="12">hope, our joy return" (PR, II, 57). Mary, too, in Milton's version, wonders about the disappearance of her son, and in a long monologue, "within her breast, though calm . . ./ Mother- ly cares and fears got head, and rais'd/ Some troubled thoughts. ...['] When twelve years he scarce had seen,/I lost him, but so found, as well I saw/ He could not lose himself. . .But I to wait with patience with inur'd [']" (PR, II, 63-102). And Jesus himself has understandable human questions about what is go- ing on: "O what a multitude of thoughts at once/ Awak'n'd in me swarm, while I consider/ What from within I feel myself' (PR, I, 196-98). Then after reviewing both what he knows the angel prophesied to Mary and the events of the Baptism, he adds: "And now by some strong motion I am led/ Into this Wilderness, to what intent/ I learn not yet" (PR, I, 290-92). ... All of these seem to me to be a part of Milton's deliberate design to give us a Jesus with whose humanity we can identify and empathize. V Let me conclude by noting that while I have argued that Milton has made Luke's Jesus as human as possible (as I think Luke himself did), the final Temptation of the Tower shows to Satan, to Jesus, and to the reader, the divine figure, the Son of God declared in the Baptism. The Temptation of the Tower, unlike the other two, involves a miracle. This is the Son of God, and any witness knows it. Note the words of Milton's Satan before this third temptation: "I here . . . have found thee/ Proof against all temptation as a rock/ Of Adamant, and as a Center, firm:/ To th' utmost of mere man . . ./ Not more. . .;/ Therefore to know what more thou art than man/ . . . Another method I must now begin" (PR, IV, 531-40, emphasis supplied). Suffering from the hunger of a forty-day fast and enduring the blasts of Satan's storm, Jesus may well wonder, as he stands thrust on the pinnacle of the Temple, whether God has deserted him. Is he a tragic hero poised at the top of Fortune's Wheel, ready to fall, as Northrop Frye asks? But he was not led by the Spirit either to jump or fall- or even merely stand in Milton's version. For suddenly the angels bear him away from "his uneasy station" to a "green bank" where they spread him "Celestial Food. Divine. . . . fetcht from the tree of life" (PR, IV, 587-89). 15 The strength of Jesus' human resistance to temptation has now authentically revealed he is Son of God. Northrop Frye writes: Christ has been tempted quasi homo [up to this point] .... For Milton, what man can do for himself is negative and iconoclastic: man does not save himself. . . . Christ has resisted the whole of Satan's world; he has done what man can do, and the only possi- ble next step is for God to indicate acceptance of what he has done. Thus the fact that Christ successfully stands on the pinnacle 85</page><page sequence="13">is miraculous, but not a miracle drawn from his own divine nature, not an ace hidden up his sleeve, which is what Satan is looking for. It means that his human will has been taken over by the omnipotent divine will at the necessary point.16 In other words, at this point Jesus reveals the Christ foreshadowed in the Baptism, although it should be noted that Milton carefully avoids using the title anywhere in his poem. In view, then, of the miracle with which the temp- tation episode concludes, it would make good sense to argue that Luke 4:14-15 ought not to paragraphed separately from it.17 For, apart from the detail that Jesus now returns to Galilee, the two verses make two points that underscore the significance of the entire temptation episode: first, Jesus is now "in the power of the Spirit," and second, he "is glorified by all." And together they would aptly resolve the self-doubts with which Milton's Jesus had entered upon the temptation in the first place. As Merritt Y. Hughes writes in his Introduction to the poem, "The climax and the final unravelling of the plot come with the discovery of the full truth about themselves and about each other by Christ and the Adversary"- and, one wants to add, by everyone else.18 So Milton, since he rounds off his poem with an Angelic Choir that begins its hymn: True image of the Father, whether thron' d In the bosom of bliss, and light of light Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin'd In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, Wand'ring the Wilderness, whatever place, Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing The Son of God. . . . (PR, IV, 596-602) But it must be borne in mind that the temptation episode is but the last event in the preparation for Jesus's ministry, and Milton, with touching diminuen- do, ends his poem with the mundane report that Jesus "unobserv'd/ Home to his Mother's house private return'd" (PR, IV, 638f.). Barbara Lewalski, concluding her study of the poem, Milton's Brief Epic, writes of Christ's search in the wilderness to comprehend his nature and discover his mission, his subsumption of the past but rejections of its dead literalisms, his abjurations of the many evil or ignoble or imperfect or less perfect modes of action which would preclude attainment of the highest concept of personal excellence and mis- sion. Milton presents a myth of human progress, or human striv- ing toward ideals of comprehension and order, of wisdom and 86</page><page sequence="14">noble action which must remain relevant and powerful as long as such ideals hold any meaning for us.19 The author of the Third Gospel, I believe, would concur.

Fitzmyer, S.J., summarizing the various arguments about Luke's order in his recent translation of Luke's Gospel {Anchor Bible, vol. 28A [Garden City, N.Y., 1981], p. 507fs.), prefers a georgraphical explana- tion: "that the climactic scene takes place in Jerusalem." But an equally strong case can be made for dramatic justification, especially in the work of an evangelist with such clear literary bent. 9 Milton's Satan takes the Gospel devil one step further in this situation. Where Luke s devil had simply tempted Jesus to "throw yourself down from here," Milton's Satan constructs a tight rhetorician's dilemma: "There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright/ Will ask thee skill. . . . / If not to stand,/ Cast thyself down; safely if Son of God: {PR, IV, 551ff.). It appears that logically Jesus has only two options, both of which force him to comply with Satan's proposal: that is, he must either stand or jump. There must, therefore, be a miracle, and of course there is in the rescue by the angels. Only thereby could the cunning of Satan's dilemma be annihilated. 10 Deut. 8:3, 6:13, 6:16. 11 W.F.

"The actual ministering by the angels Milton takes from either Matthew or Mark, since Luke includes only the prediction of it. . . . Here Milton reveals again his awareness of the tradition of parallels between the temp- tations of Adam and Jesus: in withstanding temptation, Milton's Jesus is fed from the very "tree of life" which was proscribed because of Adam's weakness. 16 "The Typology of Paradise Regained ," 237. In Milton, of course, Jesus is subsequently rescued. 17 Neither paragraph indentions nor chapter and verse numbers have ancient standing, almost every "verse" of the episode (including 13, 14, and 15) simply beginning with the paratactic-like è • 18 Hughes, ed. cit., p. 471. 19 (Providence, R.I., 1956), p. 356; italics supplied. * Earlier versions of this paper were read to the St. Louis Biblical Studies Society, St. Louis, Missouri, and to the Central Renaissance Conference at the University of Wichita, Wichita, Kansas. 87</page></plain_text>
