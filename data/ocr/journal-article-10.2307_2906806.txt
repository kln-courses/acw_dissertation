VoilA une frase dangereuse ( ... ). VoilA un discours ignorant. VoilA un discours paradoxe. En voilA un trop fol.'1 When Montaigne emblazons the remarks of would-be critics between punctuation marks in the Essais, he less often builds irony than a monument to himself, inscribing on his work a negative device or motto having an emblematic function in a text both seen and heard. The topography of the Gascoingne he belittles above in "Sur des vers de Virgile" and praises at the outset of "De la praesumption (a stratum: "II y a bien au-dessus de nous, vers les montaignes, un Gascon que je treuve singulierement beau, sec, bref, signifiant. . ."-p. 622) is rugged and of precipitous contour. The region Montaigne heralds is certainly one of himself a l'e'quart, both apart and four-sided, in an elsewhere and a self-mortgaged parcel. The dry and sunstained beauty of the area is significantly furrowed everywhere in the third volume, but still no more undeniably than in Gascoingne itself, in textual thickness and a hilly countryside everywhere marked by the imprint of a singularly severe discourse. To map the area we must fold ourselves into a text other than those recapturing the antique luster of Lucretius and Virgil, elsewhere, in the region found along the marginal crotesques that 1 Essais in Oeuvres completes (Paris: Gallimard-Pleiade, 1962), p. 853.

The shorter essays, stuffed in the corners and by the borders of the magistral chapters, tend to bind the book and punctuate the long rhythms of Montaigne's fugal prose. In this respect, "Des boyteux" is exemplary; an essay on regional styles, it returns to popular belief and the worlds of demons, monsters, miracles and cataclysm. The essay limps. An incipit of sorts, its ten pages appear to lead nowhere, affirm nothing and leave no trace consubstantial with its presumed author. Numerous specialists have read the chapter both for its enlightened content-as an exemplary lesson on the difficulty of making clear and distinct judgments in questions of life and death-and, for a form furnishing proof of the essay's meaning germinating from a word in a corner, un mot dans un coin.2 The uncertainty of chronology, underlined in the circumstantial remark about the Gregorian calendar's advent in 1581, leads to a macrocosmic play of paronomasia, where effects or choses are mistakenly overlooked byplaisans causeurs searching for concepts or causes. Discourse ambles its way to an illustration in the lower mode, a rough aside that finally explains the two words crowning the chapter, le boiteux lefait le mieux. But to adduce that because of an absent limb, cripples accumulate more vital sap in their virile organs is once again to terminate where "Des coches" had begun, with the argument that great writers find specious causes for common effects. The chapter's cockeyed shape, however emasculated next to its longer neighbors of post-1588 creation, belies a pattern of words in no way resembling a badly joined marquetry, but one in which they become the nervures, quoins and groins of a vault covering the most complex surface of architectonic design in all of Montaigne's writing. Aerial scansion of the text reveals very simple patterns of visual and aural isomorphism: conduire, comprimer, contraire, condition, consequence, contradiction, convier, conformite, contention, commandement, conjecture, composition, conversion, conception, confession, contexture, consentement, conscience and communication are 2 The terminology belongs to R. A. Sayce, rephrasing Montaigne's equivocal advice, "(c)C'est l'indiligent lecteur qui perd mon subject, non pas moy; il s'en trouvera tousjours en un coing quelque mot qui ne laisse pas d'estre bastant, quoy qu'il en soit serre. (... .)

A cause, as Montaigne saw the word, reflected causa, a legal term evoking at once a trial, a council's speech, and causari, the act of pleading that would evolve into the old French choser, to scold and to blame. A cause would signify both its classical meanings of a reason, a motive and a lawsuit and, too, of a chose, a "thing" that was simultaneously the stuff of any business. In the context of legal procedure to look for a cause behind a chose is and is not a cause, for the void between the Latin and French meanings sparks a quantum jump across the gap marked by the distance between the two tongues. To be a chatterer-a causeur-is likewise to believe both wisely and improperly, since the search for a concept should be recognized as no more than idle prattle. Pairing of cause and chose in the essay on at least eight occasions tends to show how other combinations function identically, in the same equivocal context: con-tention, con-formite', con-sequence and other terms are dissembled and then grafted together, prefixes and suffixes everywhere consolidating and multiplying signification, ultimately injecting doubt, difformity and above all, a discursive vacuity into the words that had once followed the laws of logic. Simultaneously, the repeated enunciation of con-becomes a crescendo of cacophony interfering with any ratiocinating argumentative process: the prefix repeats itself at least forty-four times in about ten pages and forces the eye to find another essential word-couple in the essay's superstructure: "Ainsin est-il advenu en l'escole de la philosophie: la fierte de ceux qui attribuoyent 'a l'esprit humain la capacite de toutes choses causa en d'autres, par despit et par emulation, cette opinion qu'il n'est capable d'aucune chose. Les uns tiennent en l'ignorance cette mesme extremite que les autres tiennent en la science" (p. 1013). The chapter's penultimate sentence, here a visual extremity, reveals what it lacks, what it has amputated or sawed away through science, the silent and indicible rumblings of conscience that, below the first surface of the opening lines, operate the immutable, biological mechanisms of the peasants, Montaigne's Gascon neighbors who never fail to find l'heure de leurs semences:</page><page sequence="4">M L N 713 La cognoissance des causes appartient seulement a celuy qui a la conduite des choses, non a nous qui n'en avons que la souffrance, et qui en avons l'usage parfaictement plein, selon nostre nature, sans en penetrer l'origine et l'essence. Ni le vin n'en est plus plaisant a celuy qui en spait les facultez premieres. Au contraire; et le corps et l'ame interrompent et alterent le droit qu'ils ont de lusage du monde, y meslant l'opinion de science. (p. 1003) The opinion of science is really no more than a lapsus, a void in spatial and mental representation, for the logic of science must of needs exclude personal bias or subjective routine in order that clarity of truth be established; but nonetheless, contained in the margins of the page and in the echo of the first syllable, it appears that the most solid observations must emanate on one level from the darkness of an absent prefix and on the other, from the pulse generated by a generalized desire to possess the other party's genitals. Underneath the con- and l'opinion of science is therefore an empty rectangle of three missing letters, signalled by the near-perfect anagram of nine digits in its place: l'opinion contains one of Montaigne's favorite words, the lopin, parcel, unit or apparel of Philosophy's metaphorical temple. As we have seen, he leaves no doubt about the word's importance when he repeats it adjacent to science, cause and chose in the chapter's three final sentences.3 Other combinations lay siege to the same edifice. The philosopher who re-assembles an effect according to a causal sequence or a semiotic chain-akin to a proof of the existence of God or today's critic shuffling quotations from the Essais for sake of lucidity and critical propriety-makes all phenomena conform to a schematic plan, a pre-established strategy that categorizes or regulates the multiple forces of a text to one reader's singularly unilateral design. But in Montaigne's country propriety is the mental surface of a nobleman's property, a place where surveyors section lots into equal units according to a Euclidean plan. Though set in a hierarchy, all parts must proportionately conform to each 3 It would be redundant to quote Etienne Gilson, Les Idles et les lettres (Paris, 1932), pp. 165-66 on the valorisation of the anagram in the Middle Ages. Suffice to say that cratylism in the youth of the printing press and a time of mottoes and hieroglyphics was of more widespread practice than the linguist Saussure may have suspected. See the posthumous Les Mots sous les mots (Paris: Gallimard, 1970) and Michael Riffaterre's careful elucidation, "Paragram and Significance," Semiotext(e), I no. 2 (Fall 1974), pp. 72-87. With this in mind, we already see in bastant (note two above) an architectural echo that Sayce had excluded from his reading.</page><page sequence="5">714 TOM CONLEY other. But if the title, Des boyteux, echoes across the chapter from the perimeters of beginning and conclusion, and if the asymmetric combinations built on the prefix con- tend to undo the order of logic, then deformity would be the natural, pharmaceutical remedy to conformity, the former-by its excessive obviousness in word and image-negating the latter, suggesting by alternate presence and absence the ups and downs of writing and thinking, the movement Montaigne seeks: a truer, imperceptibleforme. I1 y a quelques annees, que je passay par les terres d'un prince souverain, lequel, en ma faveur et pour rabatre mon incredulite, me fit cette grace de me faire voir en sa presence, en lieu particulier, dix ou douze prisonniers de cette nature, et une vieille entre autres, vrayment bien sorciere en laideur et deformite, tres-fameuse de longue main en cette profession ( ... ). En fin et en conscience, je leur eusse plustost ordonne de l'ellebore que de la cicue. (p. 1010) In the anecdote the antidote to madness is fluid in space and form, and the context of logic Montaigne establishes everywhere proves it. He passes over a certain area whose terrain is one of mental condition, slipping from the Guyenne to the Greece of the Crito. Two pages before, there occurs the famous statement that he prefers words like "somewhat," "some," "they say" and "I think" to modify the temerity of our statements. For these ends he twice inserts a hyphen into vray-semblables, again to underscore the word's antithetical or pharmaceutical parts (p. 1007), now echoed by the adverb vrayment, connoting together the opposites of truth and falsehood. And then, in a flow of words he feels imperative to change in the 1595 edition, (b) "Voire dea, il y a quelque ignorance forte et genereuse qui ne doit rien en honneur et en courage 'a la science, (c) ignorance pour laquelle concevoir il n'y a pas moins de science que pour concevoir la science" (p. 1008). The c stratum only proves in textual practice what existed in the earlier edition's theory. Repeating two words twice in the same sentence is less a mark of redundance or sloppy style than that of a hidden and supremely visual chiasmus where concevoir condenses its two historical meanings, to procreate and to form an intellectual conception. In the first clause the meanings of concevoir and science are conflated into the third and preceding term, ignorance, the fallow field from which analytic judgment must sprout its ideas. But under the verbal topsoil are seeds of other words that can germinate, like weeds, with no difficulty. Ignorance and science</page><page sequence="6">M L N 715 can be compounded to produce a new fertilizer, conscience: the new prefix signifies all that unawareness had surveyed and then conveyed through representation. Analysis leads to another cross-over that forces concevoir to be read in yet another anagram isomorphic with those that haunted Saussure. Arithmetically, the text posits that ignorance plus science equals (con) science, a science of consciousness and good faith whose sense is held in a blank space once filled by an empty prefix reserved for three letters. In addition to conforme / difforme, cause / chose and science / conscience, a fourth word-quoin controls the essay's verbal thrust. "Nostre discours est capable d'estoffer cent autres mondes et d'en trouver les principes et la contexture. I1 ne luy faut ny matiere, ny baze; laissez le courre: il bastit aussi bien sur le vuide que sur le plain," Montaigne notes, as if speaking about both single words and entire fields of logic. His statement concludes as it introduces the apparent substance of his argument on the same page: (b) "J'ay veu la naissance de plusieurs miracles de mon temps. Encore qu'ils s'estoufent en naissant, nous ne laissons pas de prevoir le train qu'ils eussent pris s'ils eussent vescu leur aage" (p. 1004). Confusion of estoffer and estoufer renders translation all but impossible, as the two words have generally antithetical meanings which, associated together, now generate the bodily oscillations of the text, a fluid topography of hill and valley, ditch and haystack or plus and minus of an undulating wave generating from a neural synapse. To stuff: or stifle: the suggestion of fabric and texture in word and etymology again puts the essay's writing in question, making the chapter exemplary of a discourse refusing to weave a convincing argument for or against what simultaneously it enunciates: "Car il n'est que de trouver le bout du fil, on en desvide tant qu'on veut. Et y a plus loing de rien a la plus petite," emphasizing a ceaseless unravelling of yarn or ultimate recovery of cosmic emptiness in infinitude (p. 1004). To knot a similar philosophical treatise is to suffocate life surging forth from the obscure and darkened, richly empty areas of experience. The metaphor strategically announces and illustrates the title and texture of the two chapters to follow, revealing in the symmetries of word and image a consistent pattern in the third volume's final pages. But a fifth opposition plays on varied spelling of the past forms of croire and croitre: cru, crue, creu appear on seven crucial occasions, and always with an equivocation leading back and forth from</page><page sequence="7">716 TOM CONLEY measurement of growth and expansion-either of wines or rivers-to belief, to cruelty, credulity and finally, adjectively, to sense of void echoing from the hollow surface of creux. The words are, as he notes, of a matter double et diverse. When Montaigne is asked to thicken or stifle his words, he is obliged to remark ambiguously, "Je le fais en condition pourtant, qu'au premier qui me rameine et qui me demande la verit6 nue et crue, je quitte soudain mon effort et la luy donne, sans exaggeration, sans emphase et remplissage" (p. 1005). Continuously forceful flow is crudely cut and injected with pauses, voids and absences in a sort of generalized asyndeton. And when the book's author encounters revealed knowledge, he flatly concedes, pausing, "Dieu en doit estre creu, c'est vrayement bien raison" (p. 1008). And as for sorcerers, "En ces autres accusations extravagantes, je dirois volontiers que c'est bien assez qu'un homme, quelque recommendation qu'il aye, soit creu de ce qui est humain; de ce qui est hors de sa conception et d'un effort supernaturel, il en doit estre creu lors seulement qu'une approbation supernaturelle l'a authorise" (p. 1009). In this respect godliness would be nothingness or hollowness, and in the neutral void we can conceive of the being as Nothing, a non- anthropomorphic entity, a non-being and a negation of a negation.4 These remarks cannot be read without remembrance of Montaigne's defense against those who criticized his style (see epigraph). The thickness and the raw cruelty of an atavistic and crude Gascoingne flow into the opposite shape of a vacuity the word both reveals and leaves behind. In effect a Latin chiasmus hovers on the margins of words possessing self-erasing meanings. Credulitas is identical both in spirit and form to crudelita; the implication is that the lucidity of scientific discourse is no more than another reified belief leading to inhuman orders of torture, exclusion and murder. Deconstruction of oversure belief necessarily calls for healthy vilification. The second and median layer of the text reflects in narrative structure the same shifts and zigzags of meaning seen in the preceding words and syllables. Montaigne's anecdotes are designed to fit a congruent spatial plan defined by three terms, two 4In this respect Lucette Finas' work on the possibilities of crue-in La Crue (Paris: Gallimard, 1972)-is not impertinent; the sense she derives from coincidences of meaning in Georges Bataille's use of crue acquires the same generalized thrust as in Montaigne's devastating essay.</page><page sequence="8">M L N 717 present and the other absent; each is self-reflective, and in mercurial fashion each becomes a discrete mark of an unending textual process producing a discourse oscillating mechanically-if metaphor can be piled over metaphor-according to the rhythm generated in a camshaft's torsion. The Duke de Nemours, nephew of Louise de Savoie, suffered from gout so cruelly that reports of a faith healer's miracles convinced him to make a long journey in search of a cure: "Se laissa si fort persuader, au raport qu'on faisoit des merveilleuses operations d'un prestre, qui par la voie des parolles et des gestes guerissoit toutes maladies, qu'il fit un long voiage pour l'aller trouver, et par la force de son apprehension persuada et endormit ses jambes pour quelques heures, si qu'il en tira du service qu'elles avoient desapris luy faire il y avoit long temps (p. 1006; our emphasis). Thanks less to preachings than to the occasion to repose his lame members during the trip, the prince regains their use: the anecdote is built in part on the pun condensing voice, road and sight, all implying a long duration of time spent bouncing in a coach rolling over a bumpy road. Thus the silence, the dimly lit space in the carriage, or the interval between action and word rejuvenates dysfunctional and bloated limbs. Pages later, Montaigne tells of Aesop who was sold with two other slaves. Upon demand the two to his left and right answered, monts et merveilles, how much they knew: the tertiary and absent term in the center, Aesop, opts for nothingness and total ignorance. His example in space is identical to the limping member or regenerative space between two stupidly functional legs or bodies, that is to say, a vital organ whose seminal emissions of laughter are a language of learned ignorance. Legs and larnyx are nearly synonymous in each example, and the recurring mention of the title at the essay's conclusion closes the series. The Amazon queen answered to the Sythian "qui la convioit a l'amour" (p. 1011) that the cripple does it best, and as practice they "les stropioient des l'enfance, bras, jambes et autres membres qui leur donnoient avantage sur elles" (Ibid.).5 The cultural 5Stropier must have descended from the Italian stroppiare, though as Latinist Montaigne must have seen exturpiare beneath the French he wrote. This would generalize the metaphor into phonic ugliness (turpis or "ugly" verbalized) as equivalent to the loss of a member. Bloch-von Wartburg in their Dictionnaire itymologique de la langue franpaise note that ex- of exturpiare has an emphatic value, indicating "the action of taking out of the darkness in order to bring into light."</page><page sequence="9">718 TOM CONLEY anomaly of inverse phallocracy becomes for the author an area of clever argument by which, in disproving the Amazonian ethic, he really verifies every point raised in the essay. Empirically, the ex-centric movement of the crippled lover would bring new thrills -quelque pointe de douceur-to those who try it, but as the ancient philosophers have abstracted the problem, the loss of one member can rechannel vital juices to the genitals; or perhaps, as was the case for the Duke de Nemours, dissipation of the legs through extended periods of disuse accumulated virile force. Montaigne's reflections meander to horseback riding and the differences between French and Italian legs: Torquato Tasso, en la comparaison qu'il faict de la France a l'Italie, dict avoir remarqu6 cela, que nous avons les jambes plus greles que les gentils-hommes Italiens, et an attribue la cause a ce que nous sommes continuellement a cheval; qui est celle mesmes de laquelle Suetone tire une toute contraire conclusion: car il dict au rebours que Germanicus avoit grossi les siennes par continuation de ce mesme exercice. (p. 1012) Underneath the comparison of nations a cheval we can certainly find proverbial meanings associated with the equestrian arts, for chivalry and horsemanship were construed to be both codes of honor and books of lovemaking, of which even today remains of Vegetius' L'Art de le chevalerie have disseminated into American slang (to hump, to mount, to saddle, to spur, to bridle, to gallop). The convention may be timeless. In fact the reverberations of words prefixed by con- can be explicitated through reference to puns injecting legal or amorous discourse with a satirical and figural immediacy. Tabourot des Accords, a contemporary of Montaigne, reminds us in his Bigarrures of 1583 of the same stereotype in a sixty line poem with which any sixteenth century reader must have been familiar: Oyez les grands regrets que faire me convient Pour le mal qui sus moy pour vostre seul con vient Je fus bien mal heureux, tout haut je le confesse Quand je touchay sur vous, tetin, cuisse, con, fesse Cher me fut le banquet, la feste et le convy Qui causerent premier pourquoy vostre con vy ( ... The spatial void inserted into the rhymed ends of Tabourot's poem confirm in space the same problematic central to Gascoingne. 6 See Slatkine reprint of 1866 edition (Brussels), Geneva, 1969, p. 39.</page><page sequence="10">M L N 719 Montaigne insists-and the thread of his arguments trace it-that a mot dans un coin, should it follow the laws of nature, must also be a mot dans un con, both voiding and fulfilling, and like the art of love, prayer or chivalry, writing must be forever fluxional. Still another tale underscores the same point. As gentleman, Montaigne is prone to note, he walks about his land and speaks with local townspeople. Once they told him of an event no more miraculous than that which happened to the Duke de Nemours. A country bumpkin and his two friends were said to have imitated a phantom by hiding below their local church's altar. From below they made counterfeit sermons, warning the public of the Second Coming and the holocaust of Apocalypse. Before the Last Judgment, however, they were apprehended and thrown in prison. By extension in the epilogue, it is proven that if human judgment can deal with overt stupidity-through expulsion from the parish-it cannot be equally just in more complicated situations. Behind the tale with its voice dissociated from the body enunciating it, speaking only from the darkness, we are led to a total absence: members of the community are amputated from the civic body, and their effects are expulsed from the population. In Montaigne's system of representation the third, mediating term, so essential for critical conscience is erased, for the three tricksters were in effect only one, opposing in frightful unity what an impossible situation can be in its binary duplicity. Like the example of the Areopagitean court (p. 1008), unable to find a motive or a cause behind an effect, the legal community must inject a hundred year interval in its deliberations rather than use the similar but vacuous verbal pause, "The court does not understand." Interjection of spatial absence or a phonic nothingness in knotty circumstances becomes the median term of a copulative darkness paradoxically endowed with regenerative power. This explains how the essay's preamble on the shortening of the calendar is in no way a careless exordium or moment where a stammering Montaigne vainly looks for his subject and the words to express it. Absolutely not: days are amputated, and so an ironic "reformation" is instituted by which longer, natural cycles are barely changed; a year (un an) is always one (un), and a month synonymous with the inner movements of the self (moy), but in a bissextile fashion, "Pour moy, de ce que je n'en croirois pas un, je n'en croirois pas cent uns, et me juge pas les opinions par les ans"</page><page sequence="11">720 TOM CONLEY (pp. 1005-06). Shortening the calendar by subtracting le jour du bissexte, a bissextile and bisexual day occurring every 'leap' year alternatively makes time limp, regrow and exhaust itself. Occasional eclipses of light are global inseminations of darkness, brown-outs whose irregularity reassures, rejuvenates and even defines the regularity of a bodily continuum. Montaigne's play on the sexual and economic connotations in the first sentences of the essay reveals an emblem signifying by interior duplication the whole chapter's form. A bissextile year-bis, twice, plus sextus, sixth-resembles a strangely bisexed plant or animal since it is a time of strange occurrences and religious menace prompting unwarranted and even monstrous behavior; it marks too, a debt or loss in an exchange of information and energy repaid in the longer oscillations of seasons generating, then following waves of accumulation and dispensation. We remember how he added in the 1592 stratum, "(b) Tant il y a d'incertitude par tout, tant nostre apercevance est grossiere, (c) obscure et obtuse" (p. 1004, our emphasis). Obscurity is illuminated by the manner in which darkness communicates with dioscurity. The bodily rhythms are again microcosmic of global behavior.7 The additional day falling every leap year is the obverse of an eclipse or loss that accompanies the shortening of a bodily appendage and insures continuation of life's cycles. For this reason Claude Levi-Strauss uses "Des boyteux" to document his study of cosmic intervals and the ethic of distance in the unfolding of universal dialectics in North and South American mythologies at the terminus of the second volume of Mythologiques: Du miel au cendres,8 in which the limper and trickster are intimately 7Montaigne plays on the alternation of light and dark in "Sur des vers de Virgile" where lustre and "lustral" activities are set in a rhythm of cycles going from volupti to viedilesse. Writing from the viewpoint of one is a simulacrum of the other. "Ce sont ombrages de quoy nous nous plastrons et entrepayons" (p. 866), for youth, blinded like Cupid (bande, p. 818), gropes darkly throughout the day, and old age, "enlightened," lives in darkness. 8 "Une demarche normale, oui le pied gauche et le pied droit se meuvent en alternance reguliere, offre une representation symbolique de la periodicite des saisons dont, a supposer qu'on veuille la dementir pour allonger l'une (par exemple les mois du saumon) ou pour raccourcir l'autre (rigueur de l'hiver, 'mols lents' de l'ete, secheresse excessive ou pluies diluviennes), une demarche boiteuse, resultant d'une inegalite de longueur entre les deux jambes, fournit, en termes de code anatomique, un signifiant appropri. N'est-ce pas, d'ailleurs, a propos d'une reforme du calendrier que Montaigne entreprit de discourir sur les boiteux?" (p. 399). Levi-Strauss does not, however, explore in Montaigne the third term so essential to the essay.</page><page sequence="12">M L N 721 related to the noise of shivarees, and silence of Lent that in the Middle Ages marked the continuity of palpable, concrete human communication in efficient and poetic terms that since have been eclipsed in the progressive weakening of our perception. The modern inertia of existential torsion must be overcome, and both Levi-Strauss and Montaigne hint, by pointing to an ever-pre-given impetus of generation with languages of the body, that a Euclidean system of thinking and writing will never rotate by easy logic. For one and the other words denoting the contours of the earth's texture, what elsewhere Montaigne calls entrelasseure ("De l'art de conferer," p. 905), are contiguous to a vocabulary of astronomy: "Revenons a nostre coustume (...) (b) Nostre discours est capable d'estoffer cent autre mondes et d'en trouver les principes et la contexture" (pp. 1003-04). The tapestry weavers are in fact synonymous with virile cripples, since as ladies they must remain seated for inordinately long periods of time in their sweatshops and therefore, in front of the shuttling to and fro of bobbins and thread, are more aroused than others. The image is not new. Villon's aging "belle Heaulmiere," in giving advice to the pretty "tapicieres," "chapperonnieres" and "saucieres," told the ladies adept at filling voids how to use the tools of their trade without squandering their time. Montaigne rejuvenates this current of reasoning by arguing that the spindle's motion has as much effect on sexual appetite as stasis: "Ce tremoussement que leur ouvrage leur donne, ainsin assises, les esveille et sollicite, comme faict les dames le crolement et tremblement de leurs coches" (p. 1012). Montaigne again overdetermines the words' meaning in the counterproof of the anecdote, since underneath the association of string and females are the Three Graces and Three Fates figuring ubiquitously in the text's margins, and with Natura they announce and regulate the cycles of seasons and years, weaving and cutting the threads of life, giving its every fiber a meaningful weave and meander. Montaigne, however, far from either respecting or fearing them, prefers to cut the knots behind the tapestry in order that cause and effect on the public side all fall to shreds. Even if reference to the Charities through the weavers is indirect, goddesses cannot but be vilified. A woman, the essayist remarks, gave him more pleasure and grace in love as a cockeyed partner than an idyllic perfection in all her perfectly bilateral symmetry: "Je me suis autresfois faict a' croire avoir receu plus de plaisir d'une femme de ce qu'elle n'estoit pas droicte, et mis cela en recepte de ses graces" (p. 1012). The</page><page sequence="13">722 TOM CONLEY Greco-Roman deities who were no doubt more common in the time of the Julian calendar elide with a more medieval-and Gregorian-Fortuna who turns the wheel of the four seasons and who regulates Nature's renewal, which of course finds its finest antique expression at the essay's end in Virgil's Georgics; Seu plures calor iWle vias et coeca relaxat Spiramenta, novas veniat qua succus in herbas (p. 1012) and symmetrically, in the beginning, with the commonfolk's unswerving fidelity to Mother Nature's temporal cycles. Old and New times, like left and right sides of the body, are part of the same alternating forces the writer describes in a late-medieval vocabulary of things moulded, grains sown, words flowered, shoes worn and coins struck.9 But simultaneously when the cogwheels of the world's machines are dissembled, its pinion-gears taken apart and reassembled, more revolutionary disorder beats according to the pulse of fear and desire embedded in the difference between conscience and science.10 Through equivocation of words, pronouncements and events the heartbeats of the universe are put between discursive brackets and traced on an always uneven cardiogram whose high points arise out of emptiness, alternation of up and down, le creux et la bosse, words forged and their subsequent forgeries. That one term of the opposition can live with difficulty without the other is one of the essay's pivotal points and the channel of its production. By inserting sexual force into the discourse of logic; by caressingly making words and their signifieds unveil themselves by attention to the folds of their diaphanous and erotic signifiers; by opposing and balancing two complementary ends of an argument at the bodily extremities of his essay: Montaigne builds a text bordering on 9 See David Kuhn, La Poitique de Franqois Villon (Paris: Armand Colin, 1967), pp. 109 and 132. 10 It is tantalizing to inflect conscience I science with an historical meaning that could be related to Montaigne's mention of the calendar's reformation. The temporal revolution has a brutal analogue in the political hierarchy where both Catholics and Protestants appealed to arguments of conscience and science. "Both sides use religion with such horrible impudence that it is hard to believe they are doctrinally opposed. Under Henry III the Protestants claimed, and the Catholics denied, the subject's right to revolt against the king in name of conscience; under Henry IV both sides did an about-face," Donald M.

"Des boyteux," hermetic and interminable in form, yet crippling in conception, like its words, leaves a gaping void in the quoin and key of Western thinking and its philosophical temple, and without this empty piece, the edifice and its rules of exchange, unless they are made of flesh and blood instead of the brick of figures, can only crumble. The absent keystone is of course, Montaigne suggests, both the couple and the copula of reasoning marked by the verb to be, the non-essence of esse, the median term between two opposites that makes one a tautological equivalent to the other. In the discourse that draws here and there a violent chiasmus or suggests an incomplete substantive or consolidation of prefix and suffix, a colorless or hidden silence, a space between two parts of an argument, two syllables of a word or two sides of a coin or two corners of a facade, between a male and a female or two heavenly bodies, Montaigne finds an overlooked and overworked, terribly sterile copulative assuring no more than the idea of their existence. As in monuments built over empty centers, this region of the Essais adopts a plan of febrile absence, a nothingness, a pause that bereft of to be, assures vital fluxions of life in effect and never in concept or cause.
