This may explain why a series of events called africa95 found themselves within the organic tension between one identity and several, not only between Africa and the Africas, but between the desire to regroup, to weight the balance of power toward a central- ized dynamic such as an art fair or bien- nale, and the desire to be conceptually, organizationally, and financially deflect- ed, fragmented, even "federated."' The africa95 season did not emerge from an existing institutional base in the United Kingdom, one that was immedi- african arts summer 199637 37 alrican arts - summer 1996</page><page sequence="2">36 african arts * summer 1996</page><page sequence="3">ately able to reflect its propositions in terms of the current artistic manifestations in Africa. It was the result of the conver- gence of different people and, with them, different sectors and discourses within the arts communities today that crossed na- tional, racial, and geopolitical lines. Its unusual structure both interculturally and in the context of the British art system makes it hard for one to establish, at this stage, what effects it will have on the long term. What follows is both an early reflec- tion on africa95, whose artistic concept I began to develop in 1992, and an attempt to question a few of the issues that have emerged from the workshops and exhibi- tions within the season. I focus in particu- lar on "Tenq," the visual arts workshop held in Senegal in September 1994, and "Seven Stories about Modern Art in Afri- ca," the exhibition that I proposed and developed jointly with five curators from Africa and the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, which traveled after its London showing (September 27-November 26, 1995) to the Malm6 Konsthall in Sweden (January 27-March 17,1996). The Royal Academy of Arts helped with the early initiation of africa95, sup- porting the idea of a parallel series of events alongside "Africa: The Art of a Continent" that would offer a comple- mentary focus on contemporary arts from Africa. It became the first link in a growing chain of facilitating and inter- connected initiatives, stretching not only Top: 4. The Spirit of African Art, 1994. Ndidi Dike, Nigeria.

When the Whitechapel Art Gallery joined the nucleus in mid-1992, followed shortly by the Barbican Art Gallery, the Crafts Council, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, and the British Film Institute, this chain began to grow, not merely institu- tionally but also through the investment and energies of many individuals in the U.K. who were ready to engage with artists and critics from Africa over the next three years. By July 1993, africa95 had the support not only of a large num- ber of artists in Africa, but of artists and experts in Britain, including Adotey Bing, Director of the Africa Centre; the writer and ANC spokesman Mandla Langa; Magdalene Odundo, who curat- ed the Crafts Council exhibition "African Metalwork"; June Givanni from the British Film Institute; Mark Sealy from Autograph, the U.K. association of black photographers; Margaret Busby in litera- ture; and Peter Badejo, H. Patten, and Helen Denniston in theater and dance. africa95 responded where it could as an intermediary facilitating organization, its expert staff and its numerous artists, consultants, curators, and writers pro- viding partner venues and advice. Sources of Inspiration: The SOAS Seminars and the Triangle Model Although it remained fundamentally a facilitating structure, africa95 proposed conceptual and artistic directions that were initially informed by two main sources. The first of these was the series of seminars and artists' talks organized in late 1991 by the Department of Art and Archaeology at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, to question and debate the surge of international interest in new work from Africa. SOAS's John Picton and I had pro- posed the meeting as the catalyst for a further conference or event whose shape would emerge as part of an extended work in progress. As "African art criti- cism" the seminars were positioned against the dominant discourse on "Afri- can art" in which historical material- objects, often anonymous and sometimes illegally acquired-continues to provide the basis for the exchange of large amounts of money, commercial specula- 38 african arts* summer 1996 38 alrican arts - summer 1996</page><page sequence="4">6.

A mixed disciplinary group that in- cluded a majority of African artists and artists of African descent tackled issues ranging from patronage and educational facilities in various African countries to the tools of interpretation in a supposed- ly "postcolonial" and "postmodern" con- dition. Alongside Olu Oguibe, Stuart Morgan presented his vision of art criti- cism and how and whom it informed. Gavin Jantjes revealed the philosophical foundations of the emerging Iniva pro- ject of the Arts Council that were in tune with an increasing awareness of and commitment to a more radically intercul- tural notion of internationalism in the visual arts. Together with the illustrated talks given by artists David Koloane (South Africa), Pitika N'tuli (South Africa), Sonia Boyce (U.K.), and Sokari Douglas Camp (Nigeria/U.K.), to name but a few, the transformative potential offered by this meeting of artists, theo- reticians, and organizers was evident. The seminars also created a space for the open discussion of models of art pro- duction and criticism proposed by black British artists in the U.K., alongside those of visiting artists from Africa, that, in the presence of critics, historians, and curators from British institutions, might begin to mold a new configuration of debate. This exchange reflected a recent historical development, African artists living and working outside Africa, creat- ing a triangular formation with outreach to and from the continent through the politics and aesthetic ideologies of dias- pora artists in Britain. Significantly, in his talk at SOAS in 1991, Eddie Chambers showed how the connection between singular activity as a black artist and the external representation of black practice in the field of museums and galleries in the U.K. had developed hand in hand with strategies that drew directly on the models artists were proposing. He and Keith Piper had formed the Pan-Afrikan Connection in 1984 and, in the tradition of artistic engagement and the subver- sion of institutional parastructures, had exhibited themselves. Later, when Mark Sealy came on board to coordinate the photography ele- ments of africa95, this dialogue between African and diaspora artists was pursued when black British photographers Ingrid Pollard and Maxine Walker and Nigerian photographer Oladele Bamboye were commissioned to create new work in response to early studio portraiture by Mama Casset of Senegal and Seydou Keita of Mali. In this collaboration, pre- sented at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham during africa95, Africa's visual artists became part of an analysis and dialogue that extended beyond the confines of continental boundaries. Seydou Keita and Mama Casset were actively resigni- fled and were no longer mute exhibits from a collection of past memories. The second source of inspiration for the artistic direction of africa95 was the phenomenon in the late 1980s of Southern African workshops, initially modeled after the Triangle Workshops in upstate New York engineered by sculptor An- thony Caro and arts patron Robert Loder in 1982. The Southern African versions, however, clearly transgressed Triangle's Euro-American art-historical paradigm, and based themselves on local require- ments. Loder had spoken at the African- art seminars at SOAS at a time when knowledge of these initiatives was rela- tively scarce in Southern Africa. His insis- tence on the empowerment of the artist as expressive and self-organizational, be- yond critics and the interpretative dis- course which surrounds and fine-tunes art practice in the West, corresponded to a pervasive and acute desire to reinvest the African artist with the visibility and voice denied and repressed through centuries of colonialism, exploitation, and racism. In creating a workshop environment through a lodge of artists in "animation," african arts* summer 1996 39 39 alrican arts - summer 1996</page><page sequence="5">in a temporary setting, one could appear to annul another aspect of the existential condition: the process of working as agents of art through the converging cir- cuits of communication, drawing up an alternative map of political, theoretical, and aesthetic interventions. The work- shop model in the early eighties, which brought artists to paint and sculpt togeth- er in a temporary setting, jarred with the dominant sense of intentional reflexivity that had led artists in Europe and the United States to adopt increasingly tech- nological references in their work and to begin, as artists, to infiltrate the position- ing of the media, the critic, the curator, and their own reified status within the precepts of modernist and postmodernist thought. The work of Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, and Adrien Piper and its reception at the time exemplify most suc- cessfully this shift in the positioning of the artist as an art-political agent within the formal and conceptual dialogue of European and American modernism.2 Only more recently, through a renewed emphasis on collaborative projects, is the connective tissue between artists becom- ing relocated in the process of actually making work together. The South African painter David Kolo- ane, who together with another South African, Bill Ainslie, was a central dy- namo in moving Triangle to Africa, re- iterates that the annual workshops in Johannesburg in 1985-88, newly named Thupelo, were a "facility." In the restric- tive and prescriptive atmosphere of full- blown apartheid, they offered artists an alternative technology of self-empower- ment and creative space. Working outside the confines of a township flat or the rare 7. Loh (Hausa Quranic board, with texts on both sides), 1984. Osman Waqialla, Sudan. Ink and gold on wood, 49cm x 22cm (19.3" x 8.7").

What Caro had called the "pressure cooker" approach to art practice had been excised from its ailing Greenbergian anatomy and, with all the seductions and contradictions of a cultural transplant, had found an articulation within a new body politic of art. However modest and short term, the Thupelo workshops and their subsequent sisters in Zimbabwe, african arts* summer 1996 40</page><page sequence="6">Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, and Botswana had begun to carve footpaths between artists across Southern Africa and the U.K. In addition, several research trips to countries in North, West, East, and Southern Africa during the development of africa95 between 1992 and 1994 enabled one to cross-reference exhibition propos- als developed in the U.K. with actual requests from artists practicing in Africa, and feed back information to the venues' directors. These extensive discussions confirmed that the majority of artists working in Africa had knowledge of the interests of curators and collectors from the West and were sharp to respond. They felt that previous exhibitions had dis- played a lack of sensitivity to the African artist as an actor within an informed and international scene which had longstand- ing roots in modernism, both in its African and its European or American formulations.3 To counterbalance this trend of new exoticism, artists in several African countries articulated the desire, over and above initial curatorial plan- ning, to meet and jointly determine their modes of practice and presentation. Particularly active here were artists in Senegal, Nigeria, and South Africa whose investment in the development of the africa95 concept and events, from work- shops to exhibitions and debates, laid the foundation for the artist-led model that ran through the season. With the early support of SOAS, Robert Loder and Triangle, the Royal Academy, the Whitechapel Art Gallery, and the enthusiasm and commitment of Nigerian novelist Simi Bedford, the africa95 project began to seem increasing- ly possible. It would not be a country-by- country representation of the arts of the continent, but an artist-led, collaborative- ly inspired constellation of events based on "connections" which might draw Africa's artists out from their marginal- ized position in the wings of current practice and onto center stage. This was a stage upon which situations would be created that might transgress the denom- inative of "Africa," and through artists' propositions and working models offer a sense of common engagement in art practice between various African coun- tries and the U.K. The philosophy of the African Triangle workshops was funda- mental to africa95 because it unequivocal- ly highlighted the participation of artists in the framing of their interaction within an internationalist circuit. Tenq, 1994 Inspired by the Southern African Triangle workshops, Tenq (Wolof: joint, articula- tion), the two-week-long visual arts en- counter that took place in Saint-Louis, Senegal, in September 1994, was the first artist-led event to take place within the africa95 project (Fig. 5). It had the effect of anchoring the season in Africa itself. With funding that came from Senegal, the event was organized from Dakar by the artist El Hadji Sy and a committee in- cluding Djibril N'Diaye, Fode Camara, Souleymane Keita, Moustapha Dime, and Anna Kindersley from the Triangle Arts Trust. The workshop model now found itself within a new specificity in which artistic empowerment was by no means an unusual phenomenon. In effect, El Hadji Sy's experiences in the seventies had anticipated the work- shop model with Village des Arts, the collective and agitational space he set up in 1977 together with Ali Traore. Its artists' studios, a gallery called Tenq, a performance area, and accommodations were located in an old colonial army bar- racks on the Corniche of Dakar. Until 1983, when the forty-odd artists who lived and worked there were forcefully ejected by the Senegalese authorities, the Village des Arts provided a source of experimentation and development for a great number of artists, including the Laboratoire Agit-Art's musicians, film- makers, photographers, painters, and sculptors (Baaba Maal, El Hadji Sy, Issa Samb, Bouna Medoune Seye). As a result, the 1994 Tenq could build on past experience and transform the Triangle model, with its laisserfaire notion of a communal artistic process, into a site in which studio and exhibition space col- lided in time and intention. In effect Tenq made Triangle itself into a found object washed up on the shores of West Africa, as the creative romanticism of Triangle's early formulation found a politicized antecedent in Senegal's recent art history. Common to both approaches was the sense of autonomy directed through the artist, beyond the specific institutional framework. Tenq signaled the different spaces of communication which could be set up. It showed the overlap between the personalized studio environment, the installation of a working process in the context of the classrooms and the archi- tecture of the school, and the shift at the end of the two weeks into a public space, from an internal circle of action to one of interpretation and consumption. Tenq was able to create a sense of the "interna- tional" from a standpoint other than an exhibition or biennale, and from within Africa itself as opposed to Paris, London, Berlin, or New York. As to be expected from a gathering of twenty-six artists,4 the atmosphere at Tenq was intense. Communication was hampered by the fact that artists came from both Anglophone and Francophone zones. Firmly convinced that this prob- lem could be best resolved by actually working together, the Senegalese com- mittee supported by the South African workshop participants, David Koloane and Sam Nhlengethwa, chose to focus on the experience itself rather than the ver- bal discussion circles advanced by the British artists. (In particular, Yinka Shoni- bare, armed with the latest art maga- zines from Europe and the United States, presupposed a certain space and shape for critical discourse.) Art, they maintained, does not necessarily be- come uncritical if it is not talked about and deconstructed through postcolonial discourse theory. With the conflation of so many different languages-linguistic, conceptual, and formal-Tenq tested the possibilities of communication both individually and collectively. These new workshops in Africa re- flect a discourse which is fragile and in formation-not, as one might assume, because the site is the African continent, but because of the nature of their dy- namic. Tenq, as an example, can be viewed as an attempt to break into a new experimental space where the para- meters of individual work are confront- ed with a collective situation, and where definitions and classifications as well as institutional framings are in left in a state of flux. "Seven Stories about Modem Art in Africa" When the exhibition "Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa" was devised in July 1992 for the Whitechapel Art Gallery as part of africa95, it extended the notion of exchange experienced through work- shop environments and the previous art critical debate at SOAS to the arena of the exhibition and the gallery space. "Seven Stories" would provide a sequence of personal interpretations by African artists and historians of movements or connections that had significantly quali- fied twentieth-century modern art, inscribing these subjective histories of Modernism in seven African countries within current debates on curating. In this sense, the show experimented with the idea of the exhibition as a pooling system for a plurality of approaches to making, looking at, and presenting art that ran in tandem with the specificities of the works on display. During the initial research visits to Africa, I met with artists to identify and discuss the possible dynamics that could provide focuses for different curatorial and historical approaches. Coupled with a zoom into these internal movements was a recognition of African artists' extensive relationships, dating from the beginning of the century, with European art infrastructures. Alongside formal art schooling was the wave of individual art enthusiasts from Europe who had brought their own version of artistic edu- cation to Africa, among them Pierre Lods, Ulli Beier, Frank McEwen, Cecil Skotnes, Bill Ainslie, Margaret Trowell, and Jean- Pierre Greenlaw. atrican arts* summer 1996 41 41 alrican arts - summer 1996</page><page sequence="7">PHOTO: CLtMENTINE DELISS To make sense of these different strands and build the contents of the exhibition around them, the Whitechap- el Art Gallery organized a forum in October 1993 attended by several of the then contributing curators: Kojo Fosu, Etale Sukuro, El Hadji Sy, David Ko- loane, Salah Hassan, and Ulli Beier. Already at this stage there was a combi- nation of practicing artists and histori- ans, so that the very notion of a uniform approach that might supply a single nar- rative line to the whole exhibition was rejected. The original concept I had pro- posed rested on a chain of individual visions that would give audiences a mul- tiplicity of perspectives, fine-tuned, con- densed, and highly subjective. The complexities of the project, from the numerous logistical details to inher- ent funding limitations, made the exhibi- tion into one of the most difficult ever undertaken by the Whitechapel. As the different approaches became increasing- ly defined, three of the sections-those relating to art from Nigeria, Uganda, and Kenya-needed greater attention. For Uganda and Kenya, Wanjiku Nyachae took over from Etale Sukuro. Nyachae traveled to those two countries, conduct- ed interviews with artists, and prepared the final selection of works along the models of narrative and popular ac- tivism. Chika Okeke joined the team in July 1994 as curator of the Nigerian sec- tion. His approach in the "The Quest" corresponded to a trail of artistic connec- tions; his precise, critical mind and con- tacts with both the younger and older generations of artists enabled him to cre- ate a narrative across time and space in the context of Nigeria's richly productive and diverse art scenes. Inevitably there would be omissions: Oshogbo, stone sculpture in Zimbabwe, the Mozambican initiatives of Pancho Guedes and Valente Malangatana, specif- ic Maghrebian tendencies, and the work of many more artists. Space restrictions aside, "Seven Stories" had to remain within the dialogical of an exhibition, temporary and negotiated. It would be without the pull toward a representative history show, but we hoped it would trigger future debates and curatorial counterpoints. As Catherine Lampert, Director of the Whitechapel Art Gallery, stated on numerous occasions, "Seven Stories" was not about individual ca- reers, a beauty parade of the ten best, but about movements and the artist-cura- tor's personal interpretation of such groupings, manifestos, and dynamics. David Koloane's story, "Moments in Art," was particularly successful in its very subjective approach to how much and through which works he might be- gin to retrace a history of artistic en- counter in pre- and post-apartheid South Africa (Fig. 1). Many of the choices, 8. Drawings by Uche Okeke, Nigeria, 1950s/60s. Pen and ink, 27cm x 19cm (10.6" x 7.5"). Collection of the artist.

Con- trasting political content with formal experimentation, and succeeding par- ticularly well in his juxtaposition of Kevin Atkinson's expressionistic land- scape and the informal paintings of the Thupelo workshops, Koloane identified the personal "zoom" into a specific his- torical moment which underpinned the curatorial model of "Seven Stories." In a similarly uncompromising way, El Hadji Sy, in "Objects of Performance," chose not to cover a wide range of artists from the seminal beginnings of the Ecole de Dakar through to current practice. His approach played on the dynamics of the avant-garde in Senegal by effectively inverting the positions: Souleymane Keita was invited to show four of his large spheric paintings on the massacre of the Tutsis in the context of a performance installation with collective and individual works by the Laboratoire Agit-Art. 42 african arts* summer 1996 42 alrican arts - summer 1996</page><page sequence="8">9. The Nigerian story. The sculpture is by El Anatsui, the paintings by Jerry Buhari. Through its fleeting strokes and filigree signs, Keita's work succeeded in in- troducing metaphors of astrological or aquatic worlds-this alongside the al- chemical decrepitude of Issa Samb's objects. If there was a middle ground between Keita and Samb it had to be Sy's own work, based on coarse rice-sacking and synthetic materials. His intervention was aimed at engaging the public with these and other objects hung on the walls, suspended from the ceiling, and gathered together on the stage (Figs. 3, 6). Visitors at the Whitechapel Art Gal- lery and later the Malmo Konsthall liter- ally walked through a painting by Sy, which separated the Nigerian and Ethi- opian stories from the Senegalese, to enter into the performance space of the Laboratoire Agit-Art, lined on either side with rusty metal sheets perforated with schematic drawings by Issa Samb. The effect was to emphasize the different per- spectives of each co-curator. On the other hand, Sy chose to use the staircase (usu- ally a dead space in exhibitions) in the Whitechapel Art Gallery leading up to the first floor, where Koloane's section began. Triangular works in painted rice- sacking and wooden crosses and assem- blages lined the walls, intentionally linking the two co-curator's visions and connecting Senegalese and South African cultural histories in memory of the close relationships the former president of Senegal, Leopold Senghor, had nurtured with the ANC during the seventies. Chika Okeke-artist, critic, and poet- sought a connecting lineage spanning two generations of Nigerian artists based in the north at Zaria and at Nsukka in the southeast of the country. His story, "The Quest: From Zaria to Nsukka" could be read as a trail across space and time encompassing Modernist pioneers such as Ben Enwonwu, Uche Okeke (Fig. 8), Erhabor Emokpae, and Bruce Ono- brakpeya along with the mid-generation artists Obiora Udechukwu, El Anatsui (Fig. 9), Gani Odutokun, and ending with the young experimentalists of the Eye Society in Zaria (Jerry Buhari and Jacob Jari), and fellow artists in the east such as Ndidi Dike (Fig. 4) and Chika Okeke himself. The routes of individual artists contrasted with their convergence into "societies" and manifestos, and in this way Okeke's section offered a spe- cific rendition of the notion of move- ment, a key dynamic which "Seven Stories" hoped to identify throughout its seven narratives. The stories presented by Chika Okeke, David Koloane, and El Hadji Sy were all drawn from the artist's point of view. Rather than clinical reappraisals of a moment in time or the genesis of a par- ticular art movement, these were highly subjective stories, rooted in the artist- curator's own experience of past history, viewed in the context of the 1990s. Including their own works within the presentations was essential to this pro- cess of reflection and could bring the public closer to their designs, enabling a more personal and condensed articula- tion between past and present. In con- trast, the double narratives proposed by Salah Hassan in "The Khartoum and Addis Connections" and Wanjiku Nyachae in "Concrete Narratives and Visual Prose" were conceived at a greater remove, with the artist no longer the cen- tral storyteller. By far the most academic of the "Seven Stories," Hassan's "Khartoum and Addis Connections" was based on the careful selection of works by leading artists from Sudan and Ethiopia (Figs. 7, 10). The works, approximately two per artist, combined a wide range of styles and media, from Skunder Boghossian's sand and pigments on goat skin to Achamyeleh Debela's pixilated comput- er prints and Mohammed Abdalla's rep- african arts* summer 1996 43 43 alrican arts - summer 1996</page><page sequence="9">tilian ceramics. They were chosen by Hassan as illustrations of the experiences of itinerancy, immigration, and the splin- tering of artistic connections in Sudan and Ethiopia across Africa into the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Arabian Gulf States, where several artists live and work today. This section emphasized the sense of a generational divide in artistic princi- ples in the Sudan. It featured Ibrahim El Salahi, who studied at the Slade in London and became one of the leading exponents of "Sudanism" in 1960s Khar- toum, advancing a visionary ideology based on the hybridity of the African and Arab cultures of the Sudan. On the Ethiopian side, Skunder Boghossian and the late Gebre Kristos Desta illustrated the circuit of exchange which brought artists in contact with each other's work in the late sixties and early seventies. In this intricate story line, the younger gen- eration of Sudanese and Ethiopian artists was seen to be equally dispersed, with Hassan Musa now resident in France, Rashid Diab in Madrid, and Wosene Kosrof in Germany. Salah Hassan's story showed how the channeling of energies abroad had created a transcontinental link, a metissage of modernisms and crit- ical discourses. Wanjiku Nyachae's sections intro- duced the metaphysical and the extraor- dinary in the context of graphic human survival, the chronicling of fears and nightmares in paintings from the Margaret Trowell School of Art in Uganda (Figs. 11, 12), and in works by Kenyan artists such as Meek Gichugu, Etale Sukuro, and Richard Onyango. Her juxtaposition of Kenyan and Ugandan selections also recast the existing polari- ty between self-taught and academy- educated artists. Her story line focused on core narrative concerns in East African art: the preparation by artists of visual understandings of the human condition in extremis through powerfully evocative symbolism and mythical imagery which might be easily accessed by and prove stimulating to diverse audiences. In effect, Nyachae's selections of both the Ugandan paintings from Makerere and the Kenyan art are excep- tionally political expressions that speak of violence and instability in the face of both natural and manmade disasters. With Richard Onyango, Sane Wadu (Fig. 13), and Etale Sukuro, satire becomes the dominant trope with which comments on corruption, food shortages, industrial dumping, and urban/rural differences in modern Kenya are explored. The installation of "Seven Stories" at the Whitechapel took place over ten days, and here too, the different ap- proaches taken by the co-curators be- came visible. Whereas Salah Hassan arrived on the final day to look over the installation and alter a few placements, Chika Okeke and David Koloane spent time checking out their configurations in the limitations of the gallery space. El Hadji Sy, whose installation required a stage to be built for the performance of the Laboratoire Agit-Art on the opening night, and whose exhibits included ex- tremely informal assemblages, needed all the time available to reinterpret the Laboratoire's dynamic. In retrospect, the installation of the exhibition as a whole could have benefitted from greater time to enable it to maintain a workshop character. This touches on the heart of exhibi- tion making and the punctuation of the stages of preparation. On the whole, contemporary art institutions are con- strained to follow rigid patterns of ad- ministration, with exhibitions timed according to the budgets and calendars of the venues and their partners. Per- haps the sliding transformation from studio to exhibition environment in the context of the Tenq workshops might have been valuable to "Seven Stories" only from the reverse position, enabling the exhibition to be deconstructed as it was being finally framed, through more of a live-in condition over two weeks. Given the budget limitations that pre- vented numerous encounters between the co-curators, the Whitechapel Art Gallery can only be applauded for the professionalism with which it devel- oped the project. Indeed, for the sub- sequent installation at the Malmo Konsthall in Sweden, this organic and collaborative process was reduced to the bare minimum. Cutting out all perfor- mances by Senegalese and Sudanese artists, and hanging the majority of works before the arrival of the co-cura- tors, this showing gained greatly in visual display (the gallery is three times more spacious than the Whitechapel) but lost the active, hands-on ambience evident in London. Returning the Curve There is a tension between the West's distancing techniques in art, in which exhibitions are key instruments, and those attempts in Africa to relate objects to people through physical contact, through the art-making process, through wearing and socializing the works as objects of performance accessible to overlapping communities. The anti- packaging approach of the Laboratoire Agit-Art veers into this form of short- lived intervention, where capitalization is less apparent and the painting simply becomes part of a temporary stage set. The tension is inevitable between the artist as the creator, recognized as the individual agent, and the object, the piece which is exhibited, sold, and cata- logued. The investment of the artist and the investment in the artist go hand in hand in recasting the relationship to the object, particularly in Africa. The issue of relating Africa's past art history to the practice of artists working there today is often seen as the central area of investigation, pervading the debates about contemporary African art. One can't help wondering, Whose issue is this? Is it the West's concern with understanding its own amnesia with re- gard to Africa's art and its denial of the artist's voice? Is it an issue in the hearts of artists working today on the conti- nent? How many will draw on the mate- rial displayed in "Africa: The Art of a Continent" and try to articulate certain aspects visibly into their own work? If the Whitechapel exhibition at- tempted to create continuity by leading us through the dynamics of twentieth- century art in Africa, then potential con- nections to past artistic traditions are only one set of keys for analyzing the works that were on display. In each of the seven stories, the notion of the past was complex; at times it related to spe- cific traditions. The iconographic trans- lations of uli body and mural painting in the sculptures of El Anatsui and Ndidi Dike, or in the paintings of Chika Okeke and Olu Oguibe, appear to hark back to the older routes of artists to sense their expressions within a new model of iden- tity. But effectively, the past goes beyond the object, that object on display at the Royal Academy, for it is the object which has died, not the artist. And with this death goes the notion of the traditional, the frozen museum piece, the encapsu- lation of Africa in the material culture of its past. As Issa Samb, artist, philoso- pher, and member of the Laboratoire Agit-Art, says: At what moment in time are we? The sun beats down on us, behind us the cowrie shell, money, africa95. Perfect. If we return to Man, the person who creates, who paints, we see another person, another man, naked. What does this naked man signify? That man is between the passage of time and the satellitic cloud and wishes at last to enter into that mediumatic space which in the past in Africa belonged to blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters, griots and mad people... London, can you count the silence of the four spheres? Can you count the colonial moment when the cowrie shell ceased to be money? And all the gold, diamonds, uranium, all those possible metals for an impos- sible continent. Let us do a work of art and science. There is no di- chotomy, opposition, contradiction between artistic discourse and sci- entific discourse. Full Stop Darwin. Samb does not deny the past, for the Laboratoire Agit-Art builds substantially 44 atrican arts summer 1996 44 alrican arts - summer 1996</page><page sequence="10">10. The Sudanese-Ethiopian stories.

In Africa, as Wole Soyinka reminded us in his address at the Royal African Society Conference during africa95, one is made to recognize the "structuring of the need for renewal through celebratory and ritual expres- sion," as if other places had no such requirement. Yet the "internal mum- mification," that "living morgue" of the "visceral" in which space becomes in- ternalized, is present in Europe too, through a form of "external mummifica- tion" for which Soyinka gives Christo's wrapping of the Reichstag as an exam- ple. Ultimately, Soyinka is ready to save the object: he is interested in "artistic anthropomorphism," in how works in an exhibition speak to and engage with other works and as such become "active participants in the creative enterprise." It is here that one is able to find what Soyinka calls "borderline art criticism": the dialogue between art pieces "where art knows no bounds." What mutual illumination is possi- ble between them-this is the route I find most dependable for border- line art criticism, to which border- line art is surely entitled-that we attempt to penetrate the dialogue among art pieces when the doors are locked and the viewers have departed. And no one should imag- ine that such pieces dialogue only with their immediate neighbors- art, goes the truism, acknowledges no boundaries.5 Soyinka spoke of "mummification" at the RAS conference on September 30. Five days earlier, the Laboratoire Agit- Art had performed an act of mummifica- tion at the opening of "Seven Stories." Here was the death of not only the pre- vious traditions embodied in the object relics of the Royal Academy, but equally the death of the Ecole de Dakar, the school of painting that had emerged with 1960s Senghorian art politics. Then, too, there was the death of the artist, caught in the web of history, silenced through colonialism, apartheid, and exile. There was the death of all the African peoples in Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia. And most poignantly there was the recent death of the main theater artist of the Laboratoire, Yussufa Jack John, who died of a sudden attack of malaria in Dakar fourteen days before the open- ing of "Seven Stories." Death permeated the exhibition as if it must, in Soyinka's words, "provoke the mythic conscious- ness; the arc of the collective," and return the artistic curve back to Africa. The formulation of new situations which can set in motion a heightened relationship between the artist, the work, the site of exposition, and the public is a concern shared in the West as much as it is in Africa, where art infrastructures are less stable. Today, the conditions of art practice are in flux whether one is standing in London, Warsaw, Dakar, or Johannesburg. Artists are proposing models of identification and models of action that seek to create open spaces within the junctures of the cultural, the political, and the institutional. Inter- pretative context and information are necessary too, yet context is always dead wood until it is recast into a living ele- ment in the communication of art rather than its justification. "Seven Stories" sought to create a dif- ferent type of context.

The exhibits, selected by the co-curators in consultation with the Whitechapel Art Gallery and me, each carried multiple other "stories" and appealed to different tastes and interests. Modernism is no longer recognized as having been a solely European act of transformation. Today, sources collide within their common histories of differ- ence rather than confirm their separate- ness and exclusivity. "Seven Stories" has already ignited de- bate on a number of unknowns, including approaches to curating, the dynamics of intercultural work, issues of intervention, of canonization, as well as the complexi- ties of Europe's relationships with Africa and the new constellations of allegiances which can be felt through both practice and theory. "Seven Stories" has, I hope, raised an awareness of the different angles through which these artists and curators have entered into the subject. Seen as a necklace of conceptual entries, the exhibi- tion offered no clear consensus. Indeed, criticisms have not been concordant, with opinions differing greatly according to the curatorial concept or artworks with which the viewer has felt more affinity. If one analyzes this mediumatic po- tential between the artist, the artwork, and the audience in the context of "Sev- en Stories," one begins to read the differ- ent points of access that each co-curator provided. This double reflection of the exhibits and their mise-en-scene is in- evitable in a show as heavily co-curated as "Seven Stories." In the context of new works by artists practicing in Africa, this curatorial strategy complements the wider search for a redefinition of tech- nologies of art presentation. Today, every aspect within the wider production of art-whether one is speak- ing of museums, exhibitions, festivals, galleries, art schools, workshops, or art magazines-is going through a period of reappraisal, with greater links being made between the models of artists and art organizers in Africa and those cur- rently in debate in Europe and the United States. Yet, redefining the position of the artist within internationalism means try- ing to supersede geopolitical and racial distinctions and their accompanying dis- courses; it means operating as artists and critics within the social body, construct- ing situations, playing with perpetual revolutions in the nation-states of art, and as Michel Onfray writes, becoming the "sculptor of the existential moment." In a modest and transitional way, africa95 was for many people such a moment.

"Federated" is a term used on several occasions by the Chairman of africa95, Sir Michael Caine, to describe the struc- ture of institutional participation in africa95. 2. The list of individual artists whose work operated within this specific gallery dynamic as brokers as well as creators is extensive. This problematic and its connection to the notion of the "material object" including that of the "tribal art" object is discussed in the catalogue to the exhibition I curated in 1990 called "Lotte or the Transformation of the Object" (see Durch 8/9, Grazer Kunstverein, Austria). It includes essays by Stuart Morgan, Paul Rabinow, Isabelle Graw, Rasheed Araeen, Simon Underwood, John Picton, Michel de Certeau, Georges Bataille. 3. See "7+7=1, Seven Stories, Seven Stages, One Exhibition" in the catalogue Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa (Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 1995) for a discussion of these debates in the context of international attention over the last ten years. 4. The participating artists were: Musaa Baydi (Senegal), Anna Best (UK), Flinto Chandia (Zambia), Paul Clarkson (UK), Ndidi Dike (Nigeria), Guibril Andre Diop (Senegal), Mohamed Kacimi (Morocco), David Koloane (South Africa), Atta Kwami (Ghana), Khady Lette (Senegal), Amedy Kr6 M'baye (Senegal), Sam Nhlengethwa (South Africa), Agnes Nianghongo (Zimbabwe), Pape Macoumba Seck (Senegal), Dasunye Shikongo (Namibia), Ymka Shonibare (UK), Djibril Sy (Senegal), Damy Thera (Mali), Yacoube Toure (C6te d'Ivoire), Babacar Sedikh Traore (Senegal), Jacob Yacuba (Senegal). The Tenq committee was composed of El Hadji Sy (Senegal), Souleymane Keita (Senegal), Moustapha Dime (Senegal), Djibril N'Diaye (Senegal), and Fode Camara (Senegal). 5.

SIEBER: Notes, from page 73 1. I use the past tense because the London venue has ended and the Guggenheim version differs in a number of ways. 2. Though this publication by Fry is undated, there is a reference to a 1920 date. Both French and American writers and critics of the period also espoused a primarily aesthetic approach to African art. Paul Guillaume, a French dealer and source of the Barnes Collection, and Thomas Munro, an American academic, together published Primitive Negro Sculpture in 1926. The Russian-bor American artist and author John Graham proba- bly introduced many American collectors to African art about the time of the 1935 Museum of Moder Art exhibition. Graham was the source of the Crowninshield Collection. Christa Clarke is completing a dissertation on African-art col- lecting in the United States from 1910 to 1940. Her recent article published by the Winterthur Museum discusses John Graham and the Crowninshield Collection. 3. Clearly my interests in sub-Saharan Africa warp this review. I do not feel competent or comfortable dealing with specific objects in the sections on Northern Africa and Egypt. 4. According to Walter Cline (1937:60), the Venda have a tra- dition that "palefaced men with head coverings" directed the local copper mines and took most of the output. Clearly out- siders, they were possibly Arabs from the coast. Further, Cline notes that "three small ingots, shaped like an inverted top hat with a number of peg-like excrescences at the bottom, have been found in or near the Limpopo River, attributed to the "Bakwena." It has also been suggested that they were left over from the casting of copper rods. 5. It was published in Fry 1939 as illustration 89 ("Spirit Head. Negro. Collection of Walter Arensberg, Hollywood"), and had been illustrated and analyzed in a lecture on Negro Art given at the Slade shortly after 1933. 6. As this review goes to press, a modified version of the Royal Academy exhibition has opened at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Less claustrophobic than the London venue (550 instead of more than 800 objects), better lit, and with explana- tory labels and wall texts, it nevertheless drew a mean-spirited review from Holland Cotter (The New York Times, June 7,1996). In a response sent to the editor, Philip L. Ravenhill, Chief Curator, National Museum of African Art, has written: It would be a shame if Holland Cotter's caustic review of the Guggenheim exhibition "Africa: The Art of a Continent" were to have the effect of keep- ing visitors away from an encounter with the arts of an entire continent. The Guggenheim deserves praise for having the courage to bring African art to a mainstream art museum audience and for assert- ing that the ancient and historical arts of Africa are of great relevance for our time. Yes, it is indeed difficult to deal with the arts of a whole continent, but the goal is laudable and the exhi- bition is richer for the largeness of its scope. As your reviewer himself notes, the exhibition breaks ground by "the inclusion of work from the continent's Medi- terranean north, an area customarily excluded from an 'Africa' defined as exclusively sub-Saharan." The exhibition also breaks ground, I would argue, in con- textualizing the works on view by very well-con- ceived and -written texts and individual object labels. These complement the autonomous objects and add much to the visitor's understanding of an incredibly rich array of compelling works of art. While main- taining the geographic divisions of Africa created by the Royal Academy's conceptualization of the exhibi- tion, the Guggenheim curators chose to arrange ob- jects thematically within each section-a point which needs to be noted. As critics or curators, we may cavil about rela- tively minor points of exhibition conceptualization and implementation, but let us admit that the Gug- genheim exhibition is a major event, one that pre- sents African art as of supreme significance for uni- versal art history. African art should become part of everyone's consciousness, and the curators at the Guggenheim and the Royal Academy are to be con- gratulated on their attempting to do the impossible and for bringing to our attention works that are stunning in their beauty, challenging in their con- ception, and interrogating in their quiet insistence that they be seen and appreciated as part of our common human history.
