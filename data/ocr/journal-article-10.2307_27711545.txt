<plain_text><page sequence="1">434 Journal of English and Germanic Philology, July 1997 The Iconography of the Mouth of Hell: Eighth-century Britain to the Fifteenth Century. By Gary D. Schmidt. Selinsgrove: Susquehanna Press, and London: Associated University Presses, 1995. Pp. 234; 35 illustrations. $39.50. Readers interested in the reciprocal relations among texts, images, and cultural contexts will find Gary D. Schmidt's book a useful if flawed compilation of in formation on the origins, development, and eventual demise of the iconographie theme of the hell mouth. Along the way, Schmidt guides us through the rele vant verbal texts?scripture and commentary, visionary and exhortatory litera ture, Old and Middle English poetry, and medieval and Renaissance drama up to Dr. Faustus?and the artistic renditions in illustrated manuscripts, sculpture, and painting. Readers will be disappointed, however, with the book's lack of contemporary argument, unity and coherence, and acceptable photography. As I read the book I noted four main points: 1 ) the visual image of the an thropomorphic hell mouth developed during the tenth-century monastic reform in England and then spread rapidly across western Europe; 2) the hell mouth first appeared in "purely private devotional forums" and later appeared in "public exhortatory forums that encouraged viewers to mediate [sic] on their end" (p. 14); 3) between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries the image became dramati cally transformed and elaborated, adding gates, cauldrons, and multiple heads, thus changing from a simple entrance to a complex schema of hell itself and damnation (p. 164); and 4) medieval drama added visual and auditory effects? mouths moving up and down, belching fire and smoke, accompanied by thun dering cannons, drums, and screaming demons. The six chapters are arranged chronologically, beginning with the tenth-cen tury monastic revival and ending with fifteenth-century drama. In Chapter 1, "The Monastic Revival and the Formation of the Hell Mouth Image," Schmidt develops his first claim that the tenth-century monastic revival in England, in spired by the Cluniac reforms on the continent, provided the cultural context for the development of the visual image of the anthropomorphic hell mouth. He also discusses the critical context, briefly citing the work of previous schol ars, including the 1977 Berkeley Ph.D. dissertation "The Shape of Hell in Anglo-Saxon England" by Joyce Galpern, and the 1992 article "'Who Can Open the Doors of His Face?': The Iconography of the Hell Mouth" by Pamela Shein gorn (pp. 1-19 in The Iconography of Hell, eds. Clifford Davidson and Thomas H. Seiler, Early Drama, Art, and Music Monograph Series 17 [Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992]). These two studies, it should be not ed, cover much of the same material as Schmidt's, due perhaps to the fact that all three authors conducted their research at the Index of Christian Art. Fi nally, he treats the reconversion of the Danelaw in the tenth century, noting that Anglo-Viking Age sculpture reflects an "ambiguous state of conversion," such as the standing cross at Gosforth, which is "completely decorated with pagan scenes of Ragnarok and the myths of Wayland and Siguard [szc]." The cross, in addition, contains an "open-mouthed monster" (Fenrisulfr) who is trying to swallow Vi?arr, O?in's brother. Schmidt is on the right track here, but he does not develop the hypothesis that the animal-headed hell mouth may be the result of a syncretic blending of Christian and "heathen" Viking con cepts. Also, placing the origins of the hell mouth in the tenth century is too late, given the much earlier "Germanic" precedents. As Joyce Galpern points out, the late Anglo-Saxon examples represent "the stylization of an already es</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 435 tablished motif rather than the first instance of its appearance" (p. 133). The motif of an animal-headed beast biting or swallowing other animals and hu mans can be traced, as we will see below, to a common decorative element in pre-Viking or "Germanic" art going back to the migration period. In Chapter 2, "The Hell Mouth and Scriptural Imagery," Schmidt traces the textual antecedents of the visualized hell mouth in scripture, citing relevant passages from Isaiah, Numbers, Jonah, Job, Psalms, and Revelation, and in Bib lical commentary, citing Jerome, Irenaeus, Gregory the Great, Caesarius of Aries, and others. He isolates four main verbal images?the open pit, the greedy lion, the malevolent dragon, and the serpent-like Leviathan?and argues that they coalesced into the Anglo-Saxon hell mouth. Although this is a useful compila tion of Christian textual sources and verbal images, Schmidt does not incorpo rate the categories in his discussion of the visualized hell mouths in the next chapter, which suggests that the individual chapters were written at different times. In addition, Schmidt does not consider here the non-Christian textual sources, such as the Volusp?, which would have bolstered his claim in Chapter 1 that Viking concepts of Hel and Ragnarok contributed to the development of the Anglo-Saxon hell mouth. In his list of images Schmidt should have incorpo rated the wolf, which he briefly mentions in Chapter 1 (p. 28) in connection with the Gosforth cross. The wolf is a powerful symbol of death by biting and swallowing in both Christian and non-Christian cultures. In Viking myth O?inn is closely associated with the two wolves, Geri and Freki, who haunt the battlefield devouring corpses. During Ragnarok two unnamed wolves swallow the sun and the moon. And finally there is Fenrir, child of Loki and Angrbo?a and brother of the World Serpent and the death-goddess Hel. Fenrir swallowed O?inn, only to be killed by Vi?ar, O?inn's son. For the most reliable treatment of these con cepts, see E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1975), pp. 56-63. Like wise, the wolf in scripture is a ravenous despoiler and destroyer of souls (see Gen. 49:27; Jer. 5:6; Eze. 22:27; John 10:12; Matt. 7:15; Acts 20:29). Interestingly, the Harrowing of Hell from the Tiberius Psalter, which Schmidt illustrates on page 74, contains a hell mouth that closely resembles a wolf with its long snout and dog-like ears; it certainly is not a lion. In Chapter 3, "The Anglo-Saxon Hell Mouth and Its Devotional Uses," the author restates his thesis that because hell mouths survive only in manuscript illustration they must have been intended for private, devotional, and medita tive use?"to inspire proper fear of hell and thankfulness for God's grace." This assertion, together with his claim in Chapter 4 that the image entered the pub lic domain in the twelfth century, is questionable in my opinion because it is dangerous to generalize on the basis of only what survives in manuscripts. Al though much of Anglo-Saxon "public" art?mural painting, sculpture, and stained glass?does not survive, there are enough fragmentary remains to con tradict Schmidt's claim. Had he examined the magisterial survey of Anglo-Sax on sculpture, Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Stone Sculpture, he would have discovered not only that scenes of hell were depicted as public art but also that a source of the hell mouth itself may be based upon a common "Germanic" decorative form. The incomplete cross-shaft at Rothbury, Northumberland, dated to the first half of the ninth century, has a hell scene on the bottom of face D in which animals and humans are entangled in a coil of biting reptiles (see Rosemary Cramp, Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Stone Sculpture, vol. I, County Durham and Northumberland, part 1, pp. 217-21, fig. 20). Furthermore, on face A of the tenth-century cross</page><page sequence="3">436 Journal of English and Germanic Philology, July 1997 shaft at Great Clifton, Cumberland, ribbon animals bite each other with squared jaws, and the bound human figure below suggests either the bound Christ or the Christian hell (see Richard N. Bailey, Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Stone Sculpture, vol. 2, Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire North-of-the-Sands, pp. 110-11, fig. 335). Thus, while some of the textual sources for the hell mouth are no doubt scrip tural in origin, the visual theme of a human or animal being attacked by beasts with gaping jaws and sharp fangs may go back to decorative motifs of the Ger manic migration period or earlier. One only has to look at the pre-Viking and Viking artifacts illustrated in David M. Wilson and Ole Klindt-Jensen's Viking Art (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1966, 2d. ed. 1980) to see the ubiquity of this theme. Among the earliest material is an oval brooch from a grave at Born holm, Denmark, depicting a fully-dressed human being attacked by two ribbon shaped animals (fig. 5, p. 36). The man-between-beasts theme is also seen on two of the jeweled plaques of the Sutton Hoo purse-lid. Likewise, the animal headed posts from the Oseberg ship-burial closely resemble the leonine hell mouths in Anglo-Saxon art (pis. XI-XII). The theme is also prevalent in deco rated initials of the tenth century, particularly in Francis Wormald's Type I ini tials with their winged reptiles with cat-like heads raised in profile with strong gapingjaws and sharp teeth (see "Decorated Initials in English Manuscripts from A.D. 900 to 1100," pp. 47-75, in Francis Wormald: Collected Writings, vol. 1, Stud ies in Medieval Art from the Sixth to the Twelfth Centuries [London: Harvey Miller Publishers, 1984] ). At least six examples of this type are seen in the early tenth century Junius Psalter (Oxford, Bodleian Library MSJunius 27), any one of which could have served as a model for the Anglo-Saxon mouth of hell. The private-public dichotomy also fails to recognize the function of artistic images, even "private" ones in manuscripts, as aids to memory in the "public" spheres of oratory, teaching, and preaching. Some of the very scenes cited by Schmidt from the Utrecht Psalter were used, as Mary Carruthers demonstrates in The Book of Memory, as mnemonic imagines verborum that cued not only the text they illustrated but chief concepts, such as judgment, punishment, and damna tion. Thus, manuscript illustrations served the rhetorical functions of inventio, divisio, and compositio. In Chapter 4, "The Hell Mouth in Visionary and Exhortatory Texts," Schmidt surveys visionary accounts of the underworld, from the visions of Paul, Dryhthelm, Orm, and Alberic to those of T?ndale and Thurkill. The Visio Sanc ti Pauli was known in England at an early date and, according to Antonette di Paolo Healey, influenced a number of Old English prose and poetic works, pos sibly even the description of Grendel's mere in Beowulf (see Sources of Anglo-Sax on Literary Culture: A Trial Version, ed. F. M. Biggs, T D. Hill, and P. E. Szarmach, pp. 66-67). Given the importance of this text, it is puzzling that Schmidt does not mention it in the chapter devoted to Anglo-Saxon depictions of hell; at the least he could have included a cross-reference. The lack of internal cross refer ences?to both topics and illustrations?is in fact a common problem in this book, again suggesting that the individual chapters were written at different times. Also, although Schmidt mentions Dante in passing (p. 92), he does not discuss the influence of the Inferno and its rich tradition of illustration on medi eval visions of hell, such as the anonymous Italian engraving of c. 1470-80 that visualizes Dante's conception of hell: the dismembered Sowers of Discord (Canto XXVIII), the barrators sunk neck-deep in muck (Canto XXI), and the Thieves entwined with snakes (Canto XXIV). Significantly, the engraving has a bestial hell mouth in the upper right (see plate lxvi in Images of Love and Death in Late</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 437 Medieval and Renaissance Art, ed. Clifton C. Olds and Ralph G Williams [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Museum of Art, 1976]). Although the book was published in 1995, it was, given the dated quality of its methodology and bibliography, obviously composed in the mid-1980s. Only eight of the 190 items in the bibliography are from the 1990s, for instance. Also, Schmidt acknowledges the assistance of Nigel Morgan, who left the Index of Christian Art in the mid-1980s. Thus, the original research was conducted over a decade ago, and this may also account for the lack of contemporary theory and method, such as those offered by Mieke Bal, Michael Camille, David Freedburg, Claude Gandelman, and Suzanne Lewis. In spite of the attempts to provide cul tural intertexts, the book rarely goes beyond the description of the artefacts. When Schmidt does offer a thesis?the evolution from "private" to "public" ico nography?the results are, in my opinion, questionable. Finally, in a book that purports to be an iconographie study, the quality, quan tity, and proper citation of the images are poor. The thirty-five black-and-white photographs are printed on uncoated paper, rendering some of them indistinct if not illegible (pages 36, 70, 78, and 163 in particular). Other images require a detail rather than a full-folio, such as the tiny hell mouth on folio 3V of the Paris Psalter (p. 36). Still others deserve a full-page photograph rather than one in reduced scale (p. 76). Many artworks, some vital to Schmidt's arguments, are not illustrated at all with photographs (the Utrecht Psalter and its earliest Anglo Saxon copy, pp. 65-66, to name only two of many). The most damaging omis sion, however, is the lack of figure numbers in the text and photographs. With out figure numbers the reader is often left helpless to locate the accompanying photographs and, of course, cross-referencing the images is impossible. To be fair to Schmidt, he may not have had the option of vetting the quality of the reproductions. It may well be that the publisher also cut down the number of photographs submitted with the manuscript. But the lack of figure numbers in the text is inexcusable, and if I had been the author I would have looked for a different publisher. Thomas H. Ohlgren Purdue University</page></plain_text>
