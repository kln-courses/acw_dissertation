<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERILOUS REALM: PHANTASY AS LITERATURE Charlotte Spivack what is phantasy? In spite of the burgeoning popularity of lit erary phantasy since 1939, there has been so far surprisingly little attempt to define it or even to acknowledge it as a distinc tive genre. Although college courses, critical essays, and new reference guides have all helped to confer respectability on those works of fiction labeled phantasies, in general there is still con fusion between phantasy as a genre and "the fantastic" as a pervasive element occurring in many different genres. Since my subject is phantasy as a literary genre, I must first distinguish literary phantasy from the strictly colloquial uses of the words "fantasy," "fantastic," and "fantasize." There is a solid historical reason behind my double spelling of the word pronounced "fantasy: phantasy as a literary genre and fantasy as a vaguely romantic hyperbole referring to anything out of the ordinary. Like many important distinctions, this one goes back to the philosophical differences between Plato and Aristotle. Plato makes the first great distinction between phantasy and the imag ination, starting a controversy that lasts through the nineteenth century. For Plato phantasy and imagination are two faculties of the human mind which deal with images of what is not im mediately present and perceivable to the senses. His considera tion of this subject is scattered throughout the Republic and other dialogues, where it touches upon the separate but inter related contexts of epistemology, psychology, ethics, theology, and aesthetics. Though there are some contradictions in what he says, there is also a clear evolution of thought which ultimately gives supremacy to phantasy as the higher of the two faculties. According to Plato, the highest creative activity is that of God in creating the universe according to a pattern of Ideas. This is God's phantasy. The highest human creativity is achieved by the poet or artist who is inspired by a phantasm implanted 133</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW in his mind by God. Phantasy as a faculty of mind leads the artist to the phantasms of God just as reason through dialectic leads to the Platonic Ideas. Phantasy as art is based on an imitation of an Idea, not of a phenomenal object, in contrast to art produced by the imagination, which involves image-making or likeness making, producing a copy of an original object according to the proportion and outward appearance of that original. As a result imaginative art is representative, and phantastic art symbolic. Since phantasy as faculty is in direct touch with divine inspira tion, phantasy as art bypasses the world of senses in favor of divinely-implanted dream and vision. Whereas Plato, writing with an idealistic and mystical ap proach, places phantasy on par with direct divine inspiration, Aristotle, following a materialistic and empirical approach, re jects the divine origin of phantasms and places his faith in the more pragmatic perceptions achieved by the imagination by way of the senses. For Aristotle the phantasy is a suspect faculty of mind, subject to error and to self-delusion. Assuming the ulti mate reality of the world of the senses, he prefers artists who imitate — who "image" — the things which exist on the level of sense perception. Since for him the phantasms which appear to the artist in visions are not the means to truth but more likely to be wild and baseless, in his opinion phantasy produces a dan gerously subjective art. In summary, then, for Aristotle phantasy implies a loss of touch with empirical reality. In the Middle Ages the debate over the contrasting nature of these two faculties of mind continued, with imagination more often regarded as a passive, imitative function of the mind, where as phantasy came to be regarded as the more creative, a power that deals with the materials of existence freely. But only in the Platonic tradition as such was this freedom respected as divinely inspired; in both the Aristotelian and the Stoic, it was associated with deviation from the normal. The combined effect was to make phantasy a paradoxical word: on the one hand, a divinely inspired vision of a higher truth; on the other hand, an unstable function, with a greater capactiy for error and self-delusion. What Aristotle's train of thought is positing is much closer to the current popular use of the word "fantasy" (with an "f") which refers to anything which is even slightly out of touch with 154</page><page sequence="3">PHANTASY AS LITERATURE material reality, be it fake flowers or sun tan lotion. Since Aris totle was transmitted to and interpreted by the Middle Ages in Latin, his word "fantasia" is properly spelled with the letter "f." Plato, whom we have inherited more directly from the original Greek by way of the Renaissance, spelled "phantasia" beginning with a "phi," the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet. This is the reason I spell the word "phantasy," meaning a kind of literature based on a vision of a non-empirical reality, with a "ph." the Eng glish transliteration of "phi." Literary phantasy is much closer to Plato's phantasia (with a "phi") than to Aristotle's fantasia (with an "f.") What I call the "ph" factor then is no trivial mat ter. It is the difference between madness and inspiration, be tween daydreams and literary form, between a loss of touch with reality, on the one hand, and a vision of a transcendental reality, on the other. Unfortunately most modern theorists of literary phantasy have fallen into the Aristotelian camp — or trap. Todorov's well known structural definition of "the fantastic" does just that. According to his formula: In a world which is indeed our world, the one we know, a world without devils, sylphides, or vampires, there occurs an event which cannot be ex plained by the laws of this same familiar world. The person who experiences the event must opt for one of two possible solutions: either he is the victim of an illusion of the senses, or a product of the imagination — and the laws of the world remain what they are; or else the event has indeed taken place, it is an integral part of reality — but then this reality is controlled by lawp unknown to us. Either the devil is an illusion, an imaginary being; or else he really exists, precisely like other living beings — with this reservation, that we encounter him infrequently. The fantastic occupies the duration of this uncertainty. Once we choose one answer or the other, we leave the fantastic for a neighboring genre, the uncanny or the marvelous. The fan tastic is that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an apparently supernatural event.1 An assumption similar to this one of Todorov's — that the fan tastic is the momentarily inexplicable — underlies Eric Rabkin's book The Fantastic in Literature, which includes such diverse specimens as detective fiction, Gothic fiction, Alice in Wonder land, Tom Jones, and The House of the Seven Gables, and iTzvetan Todorov, Introduction to the Fantastic in Literature, tr. Richard Howard (Cleveland: Press of Case Western Reserve University, 1973), p. 25. 135</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW lamely concludes that fantasy can be defined as the polar oppo site to reality. At any rate, when we move away from Todorov and Rabkin, with their Aristotelian notions of the fantastic, and back to Plato, we find that the great Greek idealist offers us a starting point toward defining literary phantasy: to wit, a work of art, envision ing a transcendental reality, perceived through the faculty of phantasy which has been inspired by a divinely implanted Idea. Philosophically this starting definition has the advantage of get ting rid of the trivial material distractions of the fantastic (with an "f.") It remains, however, to relate this philosophical defini tion to some sort of literary form, since we are concerned with works of literature rather than with a vision as yet unconverted into language. Since visionary phantasy in literature involves an escape from the familiar work-a-day world, it is inevitably re lated to that large category of literature which has traditionally dealt with the theme of escape — namely, the romance. II To associate the literary romance with reading for escape is by no means to denigrate it. Tolkien defended the kind of reading which permits a reader to escape from a lower and more imme diate order of reality to a higher and timeless reality: I do not accept the tone of scorn or pity with which "Escape" is now so often used; a tone for which the uses of the word outside literary criticism give no warrant at all. In what the misusers are fond of calling Real Life, Escape is evidently as a rule very practical, and may even be heroic. In real life it is difficult to blame it, unless it fails; in criticism it would seem to be the worse the better it succeeds. Evidently we are faced by a misuse of words, and also by a confusion of thought. Why should a man be scorned if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it. In using Escape in this way the critics have chosen the wrong word, and what is more, they are confusing, not always by sincere error, the Escape of the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter.2 2J. R. R. Tolkien, "On Fairy Stories," reprinted in The Tolkien Reader (New York: Ballantine Books, 1966), p. 60. 136</page><page sequence="5">PHANTASY AS LITERATURE Since so many disparate forms of romance offer escape, how ever, it remains to ascertain how phantasy differs from the others. The principal modern critic to have dealt extensively with romance is Northrop Frye, whose mythic approach seems to me appropriate to its nature. Frye defines romance as a se quence of marvelous adventures, given form by the major cen tral adventure, which is a quest. This adventurous quest can take many separate forms, the most popular of which are phan tasy, science fiction, Gothic fiction, and detective stories. Essen tially the difference between phantasy and the others proceeds from the fact that the other kinds of escape literature are drawn from heightened images of our own immediate world. They are products of the imagination as an image-making faculty. There are murders and detectives, there are secret love affairs, and men have walked on the moon. As yet, however, there are no authen ticated balrogs. Phantasy does not deal with such images of physically real life, consciously perceived and artfully extrapo lated. Instead it deals directly with the realm of the unconscious. When we escape into realistic fiction, we discover a mirror image of ourselves; when we escape into the speculative kinds of romance, like science fiction and detective fiction, we discover a challenge to our powers of what Poe calls ratiocination, or rational problem solving. Both of these discoveries are quite consciously achieved. In phantasy, however, we discover a cer tain dimension of ourselves that we do not encounter directly in most other fiction. In the magical realm of phantasy, we dis cover the perilous realm of our own unconscious. Not our pub lic, masked selves, but our innermost selves beneath the mask. Phantasy presents in symbolic form that irrational realm in vested with all kinds of monsters and marvels which were long ago depicted in mythology, and which modern psychology rec ognizes through dreams as the contents of the unconscious. As Ursula LeGuin succinctly expressed it, phantasy "speaks to the unconscious, from the unconscious, in the language of the un conscious."3 The visionary world —or, to use Tolkien's phrase, the sec ondary world — of phantasy has, then, its own interior logic and •'Ursula LeGuin, "The Child and the Shadow," Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress, 32 (April, 1975), 141. 137</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW coherence, but it is not a replica of our world and does not obey the laws of our daily existence, but, more like a dream, it moves in its own wondrous ways and fulfills its own strange laws. As in other romances, the typical plot of phantasy involves a quest, outwardly for a treasure or a talisman, like a magic ring, but inwardly it is a symbolic quest for individuation. The old famil iar episodes of the fight with a dragon or the visit to an under world represent important stages in that individuation process. The typical characters in phantasy are thus the symbolic repre sentations of the archetypes — what Jung called the "little peo ple" — which populate the unconscious. These archetypes are analagous to Plato's phantasms, in the sense that they are just there, and do not have to be arrived at through rational effort. The quest in phantasy, then (in LeGuin's words) is "about the journey to self-knowledge, to adulthood, to light. Fantasy is the medium best suited to a description of that journey, its perils and its reward. Only the symbolic language of the deeper psyche will fit the events of that voyage without trivializing them."4 In this way phantasy is also close to myth. Mythology provides both source and analogue for much modern phantasy. Often the phantasist uses undisplaced myth, as in Evangeline Walton's four volume retelling of the Welsh Mabinogian, or in Fletcher Pratt and Sprague de Camp's parodie account of Norse myth in The Roaring Trumpet. And mythic materials are borrowed freely by J. R. R. Tolkien, Peter Beagle, Lord Dunsany and others. Even more important, however, in modern phantasy the narra tive structure parallels those standard mythic patterns which represent, as mythologist Joseph Campbell and psychologist Erich Neumann have demonstrated, the archetypal images which the ego must interact with in the course of its develop ment from birth to death. Phantasy in effect becomes a new mythology in that it plays the same role and fulfills the same purposes as ancient myth in the earlier stages of human culture. Myth functioned on four levels in primitive society: metaphys ically, it reconciled consciousness with the painful preconditions of its own existence; cosmologically, it formulated an image of the universe; sociologically, it validated and maintained a social *lbid„ p. 144. 138</page><page sequence="7">PHANTASY AS LITERATURE order; and psychologically, it traced the pattern of individual development. In tapping the resources of the unconscious, the modern phantasist is creating a mythology which functions to some extent in all of these ways, but especially in the first and last, the metaphysical and psychological. In a recent book, psy chologist James Hillman remarks that "Mythology is a psychol ogy of antiquity. Psychology is a mythology of modernity."5 I should like to add that modern phantasy, in its symbolic quest, is the literary expression of that psychology which is a mythology of modernity. Ill The word "modernity" raises the question of when phantasy as a genre appeared, and when it began to take the place of myth ology. As I see it, phantasy began with the Renaissance, the great watershed in the history of the western world. Through out the Middle Ages the romance functioned in ways that myth had not done earlier. The Arthurian romances exemplify the quest motif and engage archetypal figures like the wizard Mer lin and Morgan LeFay in adventures of individuation in highly symbolic landscapes. T. H. White has of course translated the Arthurian material directly into his modern phantasy The Once and Future King. What is also true of the Middle Ages is that the visionary secondary world of phantasy had not yet split off from the real world but rather infused it. The medieval mind believed in several levels of reality and accepted the prevalence of wonders and marvels in a matter-of-fact way. And the natural world was viewed as essentially animistic. As Carolly Erickson writes in her recent book The Medieval Vision, "The visionary imagination was in the medieval period not aberrant but mun dane, not unearthly but natural, even commonplace . . . Medi eval perception was characterized by an all-inclusive awareness of simultaneous realities."8 The beginnings of the scientific "'James Hillman, The Dream and the Underworld (New York: Harper and Row, 1979), p. 23. 6Carolly Erickson, The Medieval Vision (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976), p. 27. 139</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW model of the universe in the Renaissance, with its attendant dis sociation of sensibility, (to borrow Eliot's phrase), brought in its wake a need to relegate the visionary world of angels and portents to the realm of literature. With the retreat of the Faer ies (or what C. S. Lewis calls the "longaevi") from the primary world, the land of Faerie becomes a secondary world of phantasy. Hence the first major phantasy is Spenser's Faerie Queene which, didactic and allegorical though it may be, introduces unabash edly a secondary world. The land of Faerie is not dreamed about or even traveled to, it just is. After Spenser, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the romantic impulse toward escape developed more in the direction of science fiction and Gothic fiction, but the nineteenth century, with the added impetus of the medieval revival, saw a flourishing of the genre of phantasy in such important figures as William Morris and George Mac Donald. This dissociation of sensibility which creates a secondary world of phantasy in contrast to the modern world, but parallel ing rather the worlds of myth and romance, raises a series of specific questions about the nature of that secondary world. Granting its theoretical origins and analogues in philosophy, mythology, and psychology, what is the secondary world of mod ern phantasy actually like? What are the laws of that world? What events occur there? What characters appear in it? What kinds of landscape does it have? When does it purport to take place? How does it begin and end? In short, how does the reader know that he is there? First and foremost is the atmosphere of enchantment and the central role of magic. I mean real magic, not mere illusion, allied to the mystery that underlies even the laws of science. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrohe, C. S. Lewis speaks of "the deep magic from the dawn of time," which is powerful indeed, but not strong enough to compete with the "deeper magic from before the dawn of time." This deeper magic has nothing to do with sleight of hand, with making rabbits appear from hats, or with any of the usual charlatanry associated with popular magical tricks. It is the magic of life itself, on a level that transcends the laws of anatomy, or probability, or mathe matics, or any of those so-called laws, which are, from the view 140</page><page sequence="9">PHANTASY AS LITERATURE point of the phantasist, not really laws at all, but mere super ficial and local ordinances. It is the magic that according to G. K. Chesterton expresses both the "mystery" and the "arbi trariness" of nature. As he puts it, in The Ethics of Elf land, "A tree grows fruit because it is a magic tree. Water runs downhill because it is bewitched. The sun shines because it is bewitched."7 The secondary world of phantasy is thus free from the restric tions imposed by the so-called "laws of nature" as well as by the "facts of science." It is an enchanted world, extrapolated from dreams rather than from science or nature. This enchanted view of nature is by no means to be confused with the super natural, however; the magic is in nature itself. I disagree with the definition given by Colin Manlove in his study of five mod ern phantasy writers, that it is "a fiction evoking wonder and containing a substantial and irreducible element of the super natural."8 In the phantasy world the sources of power and energy are two: Nature and the Word. There is inherent power in the sim ple items of nature not transformed by technology. The magical power in wood converts the wizard's wand into a "werelight." The magical energy in iron frightens off malevolent fairies with out even touching them. Dawn turns trolls to stone, and stones can challenge the wills of men. The wizard achieves some control over this power of magic by learning the real names of things. In the Word is the art of wizardry, and the ultimate knowledge consists of naming. To know the name of a thing is to have power over it; therefore real names are kept secret. A person's given name is not one's true name, which must be both earned and learned, and once learned must be guarded as a secret. What then is the landscape of this world in which power re sides in simple nature? Every feature of its landscape is charged with meaning and intention: dark forests where monsters lurk, malicious mountains stirring up storms, flickering marshlights that lure travelers into a swamp, malevolent trees with shoots that strangle. Like the medieval world, it is animistic. But the mun IG. K. Chesterton, "The Ethics of Elfland," in G. K. Chesterton: A Selection, ed. W. H. Auden (London: Faber and Faber, 1970), p. 180. «Colin Manlove, Modern Fantasy: Five Studies (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), p. 1. 141</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW dane landscape functions symbolically as well: a tower falls in order to fulfill a prophecy, and a lamp post grows like a tree. What are the events that occur in this magical secondary world? The plot is double: the actions that occur in the outside world, and those that take place within the hero. The outer plot, as in other romances, takes the form of a quest, usually involv ing a search for treasure and a struggle with the monster who guards it. The quest begins when the hero follows a call to adventure. Living a peaceful, contented life, he is suddenly in terrupted by a call to undertake a dangerous quest. To do so, he must enter a strange world, a world psychologically and phys ically apart from the everyday world he is accustomed to. In some phantasies "the fields we know" (to borrow a phrase from Dunsany) lie alongside the world of Faerie; in others the entire action takes place in the perilous realm, but the journey forth from the familiar is always called for. He enters that strange world through some magically endowed threshhold — a pool, a gate, a forest, a wardrobe, a looking glass, or a picture frame — often guarded by an ominous figure that he must either conquer or conciliate. Once in that world, he has a variety of adventures: he gets lost, he gets help, often from an animal; and he encoun ters a series of non-human figures, unfamiliar to him yet strange ly intimate, some of which give aid and some of which threaten him. After his encounters with these weird figures and the irra tional forces they represent, he is ready to return to his own world, with quest completed both in terms of his external mis sion and of the changes within himself. IV These inward changes bring us to the other plot, the one which takes place within the psyche. The world of the phantasy is the realm of the unconscious, and the adventurous encounters there with archetypal figures represent the movement of the ego to ward greater consciousness of self. The literal quest parallels the symbolic quest for identity. 142</page><page sequence="11">PHANTASY AS LITERATURE The inner plot, or the symbolic quest for identity, brings us to the next question: who—or what — are the characters in phantasy? The central character is of course the reader, as the perilous realm of marvelous adventures is that of his own (and everybody's) collective unconscious. Most of the other charac ters, however, are those archetypes which manifest themselves as images and are familiar to us in dreams and in myth and fairy tale. Jung called these anthropomorphic images of the archetypes the "little people" of the psyche. Three of the most important archetypal figures in phantasy are the Great Mother, the Shadow, and the Wise Old Man. The Great Mother in her positive mani festation is quintessentially maternal, the earth and the city as well as a woman; negatively, she becomes the Terrible Mother who devours and destroys. She is the White Witch; she is Shelob, that bloodthirsty spider the hobbits encounter in the cavern. The Shadow is also important — an image of the dark, inferior part of all of us, it is also perversely energetic and powerful. It appears as Caliban, Frankenstein's monster, Stevenson's Mr. Hyde, Frodo's enemy Gollum, Ged's shadow-beast, and Mowgli's grey brother. The Shadow becomes a serious threat when it is denied admission to the consciousness, but it can also be a valu able guide to self-knowledge. Most important of all the arche typal figures in phantasy, however, is the Wise Old Man, usually as magician. As the wisdom of age he is paternal and supportive, but in his negative form he may be a fearful ogre. In Jung's words, he is an image of "spirit in the shape of a man, hobgoblin, or animal (often in the guise of a magician, doctor, priest, teach er, professor, grandfather, or any other person possessing author ity) who appears in a situation where insight, understanding, good advice, determination, planning, etc. are needed but can not be mustered on one's own resources. . . . He represents knowledge, reflection, insight, wisdom, cleverness, and intuition, on the one hand, and on the other, moral qualities such as good will and the readiness to help."8 He is Gandalf. He is Merlin. When do the events take place? How does phantasy begin and end? The temporal setting is as distinctive as the spatial. In 9C. G. Jung, "The Phenomonology of the Spirit in Fairy Tales," in The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol. IX (Prince ton: Bollingen Series, 1959), p. 222. 143</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW phantasy time is cyclical, in contrast to science fiction, which tends to be both linear and future-oriented. Phantasy is postu lated on a cyclical view wherein each life, each world, repeats a cycle. There is no progress, only renewal. Every birth is a new beginning, every death an opportunity for rebirth. In this sense phantasy is a-historical. It takes place not in the past, but out of time. The enchanted occurrences of phantasy are not in the re mote past of a "never-never" land, but rather in the remote present of the "forever and ever." Related to this temporal scheme is the optimistic view of re newal and transformation, which in turn brings us to the nature of the ending in phantasy. It is not true that suffering and death do not occur in phantasy — they do — but there is a transcendent feature which goes beyond. Even if a particular work of phantasy ends with the destruction of a world, as is the case in The Last Battle, which concludes the Narnia Chronicles, the end is but a new beginning. Although the beautiful country of Narnia is destroyed, and the children protagonists are killed in a train wreck, a better world will follow. As Lewis puts it, "School is over; the holidays have begun."10 Lewis' view is also specifically Platonic in that the Narnia which is destroyed is not the real Narnia: the real Narnia is immortal and unchanging. Tolkien invented a new word for this kind of happy ending — Eucatas trophe. He explains, "It does not deny the existence of sorrow and failure; the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance; it denies universal final defeat and gives a fleeting glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief."11 V The visionary genre of phantasy, then, has a recognizable sec ondary world, with a mythic structure involving a quest narra tive, with archetypal characters and symbolic landscape, postu IOC. S. Lewis, The Last Battie (New York: Macmillan, 1956), p. 173. UTolkien, op. cit., p. 71. 144</page><page sequence="13">PHANTASY AS LITERATURE lated on a cyclical view of time, and ending characteristically with eucatastrophe. It is a perilous realm drawn from the uncon scious of the psyche often by way of myth and dream. It is divorced from science and technology as well as from mundane history and geography. Phantasy is likely to be not only anti scientific, as in Lewis' That Hideous Strength with its satiric parody of a professional scientific organization (the N.I.C.E.), but it is often actually a-scientific, as if the whole business had not been discovered yet. The phantasist typically sends his char acters traveling by boat or by animal: even wheels are rare in phantasy, much less engines. Lewis demonstrates the shift from science fiction to phantasy in his space trilogy, when in the first volume (Out of the Silent Planet) his hero travels to Malacandra in a spaceship, but in the second (Perelandra) he takes the jour ney to another planet in a coffin. In a secondary world equipped with flying coffins — or magic carpets, for that matter — the spaceship will never be invented. Instead phantasy finds its mo tivating energy in magic and its culture hero is the wizard, who can tap the resources of magic because he knows the real names, the words of power. And the protagonist is the reader, who moves through the twilight border of his own conscious development to enact a series of archetypal encounters in the depths of his own psyche. There has been in the 20th century an extraordinary efflor escence of phantasy fiction, some with the stature of literary mas terpieces, some of the marginal "sword and sorcery" variety. Among the best of these richly elaborated secondary worlds are those of Narnia, Middle Earth, and Earthsea, all written in series. The seven-volume Narnia Chronicles of C .S. Lewis were written specifically for children. The protagonists are four English chil dren who enter the world of Narnia through a wardrobe in a large country house. They find a world of talking animals and animated nature, of tree and water spirits, of mythic centaurs and the god Bacchus, or original creations like the marshwiggles and the monopods, and of great archetypal figures like the Wick ed White Witch of the North and the kingly lion Asian. Each of these books and its inception, Lewis tells us, is a picture. As is typical of phantasy, they did not originate through a conscious 145</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW plan but rather through a pictorial image which possesses its own vitality and creates its own meaning. As Lewis remarked, The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and par cels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself, 'Let's try to make a story about it.' At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Asian came bounding into it. I think I had been hav ing a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why He came. But once He was there He pulled the whole story together, and soon He pulled the six other Narnian stories in after Him.12 Obviously the statement implies a lot about the role of dreams and the unconscious in creating phantasy. Probably the most ambitious secondary world in modern phantasy is Middle Earth, created by J. R. R. Tolkien and in itiated in a book intended for children — The Hobbit — but developed and fulfilled on a completely adult level in the Lord of the Ring trilogy and The Silmarillion. In large part the books came about through Tolkien's imaginative response to the old English epic of Beowulf. In 1936 he had published an important lecture called Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics; and in 1938 he went on to publish his essay about phantasy called "On Fairy Stories." (The Hohhit was published in between, in 1937). In writing about Beowulf, Tolkien reprimanded his contempor aries for doubting that the mythic imagination can deal with profound moral and spiritual issues, and upset them by insisting that the dragon is the embodiment of radical evil and is there fore the central figure in Beowulf. "A dragon," he said, "is no idle fancy. Whatever may be his origins, in fact or invention, the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men's imagination, richer in significance than his barrow is in gold."13 And he in corporated a dragon in the first stage of his quest phantasy, The Hohhit. Furthermore, this erudite scholar, expert in Old and Middle English literature and master of several languages, de voted his spare time for over twenty years in the prime of his life to writing a thousand-page phantasy: not a work of scholar 12C. S. Lewis, Of Other Worlds, ed. Walter Hooper (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1966), p. 42. l»J. R. R. Tolkien, "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics," Proceedings of the British Academy, 22 (1936), pp. 15-16. 146</page><page sequence="15">PHANTASY AS LITERATURE ship nor even a weighty philosophical novel, but a phantasy. The secondary world he created, with its own calendar, its own maps, its own languages, moving through several ages from the creation myth in the Silmarillion to the departure of the elves for the Undying Lands at the end of the trilogy, has become for its more devoted fans more immediate than the primary world. The features of the trilogy conform to what I have said about the nature of phantasy, although to cite them can by no means do justice to the complexity of these books. In addition to Tolkien's and Lewis' phantasy series, but very different from them in mood and tone, Ursula LeGuin's trilogy portrays the secondary world of Earthsea. LeGuin's background prepared her unusually well for writing phantasy, as she is the daughter of a well-known anthropologist, Theodore Kroeber, and had through him the valuable experience of spending time living in and researching primitive non-technological societies. As a child she also read stories from a children's version of Fra zer's Golden Bough. Her Earthsea trilogy traces the individua tion of a boy named Sparrowhawk, who eventually becomes a professional mage, after receiving his real name of Ged. The overall quest theme which occupies the narrative movement of the trilogy depicts Ged in a series of archetypal encounters: with his shadow, with the feminine side of his nature, with a dragon, and with a journey to the land of the dead. The setting is a sea densely occupied by scores of scattered islands, so that Ged's development is seen as a psychological sea journey from island to island. Whereas Lewis writes for children, and Tolkien presents a totally adult world, LeGuin in the Earthsea trilogy is writing primarily about adolescence, about coming of age. All three, however, are visionary exemplifications of the secondary world of phantasy. Although it is the tendency of modern phantasists to write books in series, partly through the Tolkien trilogy influence, there is an occasional single work which stands out for the quality of its writing. One such example is The Last Unicorn of Peter Beagle, a kind of sublime parody of the genre, with its anti wizard Schmendrick (a combination of Mandrake the magician and "schlemiel?"); its spirited heroine Molly Grue, a kind of dowdy Maid Marian; and the central role of the unicorn, who 147</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW becomes for a time the Lady Amalthea (thanks to Schmendrick's bumbling spells). The setting moves from a circus of illusory mythological beasts, through a forest where a latterday Robin Hood awaits recognition only to be put to rout by the magic reappearance of the original outlaw, and to the desiccated waste land of Hagsgate, where King Haggard's castle is doomed by prophecy to fall into the sea. Beagle combines elements of Nor dic and Celtic mythology with a wild plot, highly successful char acterization, and a witty, metaphorical style in this unusual comic phantasy, the best of its kind since T. H. White. All of these secondary worlds — Narnia, Middle Earth, Earth sea, and the shifting worlds of The Last Unicorn —exemplify the genre of phantasy as I have outlined it, and all offer a high level of escape reading. But they offer much more than escape — they offer discovery. What we encounter in phantasy awakens reflections deep in our own psyches. We meet images which strike a responsive chord within: the dragon on his hoard of gold, the faun carrying an umbrella, the struggle with a shadow-beast — like dreams, these figures stir vague pre-rational memories. Unlike other forms of escape reading, which achieve an infinite variety in their exploration of other worlds, reaching even to the stars in the most distant nebula, phantasy probes another infin ity: the one and unchanging yet ever mysterious world within. And, as G. K. Chesterton observed, "The self is more distant than any star."14 The readership of good phantasy is as broad as that for all good literature. There is no question about its popularity — dur ing the past several years there has been no time when at least one phantasy novel was not on the best-seller list. The Silmar illion held first place for several months, and currently Mary Stewart's The Last Enchantment (the third in her series about Merlin) has ranked high. But there are no doubt readers who regard phantasy as a sub-cultural genre. There have certainly been critics, for the most part vehement defenders of the realistic or naturalistic mode, who violently reject phantasy. One of the most notorious example is Edmund Wilson's attack on Tolkien in his review article called "Oo, those awful ores!"

In general I think we have moved away from the critical stance of a generation ago that made many of us read phantasy (and science fiction as well) in a closet. But although courses in both genres have achieved ex traordinary popularity on university campuses around the coun try, there is still a tendency to shun them in mainstream criticism. LeGuin as usual has the right thing to say on the subject of those who dislike or disregard phantasy. "People who are threat ened by the imagination usually dismiss works of phantasy as childish. The dismissal is a confession of impotence. Phantasy is childlike in the sense that the kingdom of God is within you — not understandable by intellect."15 15Ursula LeGuin, "Do-It-Yourself Cosmology," Parabola 2 (1977), p. 17. 149</page></plain_text>
