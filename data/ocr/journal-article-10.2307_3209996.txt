McDonald Fragments of large human statues made of chalky clay were found in the 1930s in the earliest strata of ancient Jericho (Tell es-Sultan). This head and parts of the body of a plaster statue were discovered in the utipper layers of what became known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period. The life-size head (measur- ing 21 by 15 centimeters) is flat in the back and almost disk-shaped when examined in profile. Delicately modeled facial features inclutde arched eyebrows, a small nose, rounded cheeks, and a small pinched mouth. The area of the eyes have been cut out and inlaid with common Mediterranean sea- shells. Dark-brown painted lines encircle the face in a radial design that resembles the stone mask from the Nahal Hemar Cave.

It was dis- covered only a few years ago in a cave lo- cated on the bank of Nahal Hemar, a dry river- bed in theJudean Desert. After the initial discovery of the cave by bedouins in 1983, the Israel Department of Antiquities began excavations that uncovered three strata of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, which date to the seventh millennium B.c. Recovered artifacts include seashells, basketry, textile fragments, clay and bone figurines, and this startling mask. The back is hollowed out and there are three major openings-two uneven circles were removed for the eyes and the small mouth is shown open with four teeth carved in both the upper and lower jaws. A small pointed nose (which has been restored) and prominent cheekbones add to its stark but arresting nature. Traces of red, green, and white paint appear in various places, as well as a painted radial design. Eighteen irregularly spaced holes along the edge may have been used to attach ornaments or to fasten it to a garment. How the mask was originally used is unknown but it almost certainly was of cultic significance to some early inhabitants or visitors of the Judean Desert. (IDAM 84-407) autumn nearly two hundred objects from the collections of S the Israel Museum are on ex- hibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. After opening on September 25, the exhibition will run through January 4,1987, and will then travel to the Los Angeles County Mu- seum of Art in early April and to the Houston Museum of Fine Arts in late October of 1987. The material for the exhibition was chosen chiefly for its aesthetic impact, but with archaeological significance very much a corollary criterion. It is therefore a large and an eclectic show representing artifacts from the tenth mil- lennium B.C. through the mid-seventh century A.D. A careful selection of the finest works has been made to reflect the rich historical and cultural periods within that broad range. Some of the highlights include a sickle handle of the Natufian period (tenth millennium B.C.) from HaNahal Cave and a rare limestone mask (seventh millennium B.C.) from the recent exca- vations of the Neolithic cave site of Nahal Hemar in the Judean Desert. A spectacular hoard of Chalcolithic artifacts was discovered in 1961 in a remote cave in the NahalMishmar canyon. Excavations in the cave have revealed remains from the Bar Kokhba period (second century A.D.) and the late Chalcolithic age (fourth millennium a.C.). The grouping of objects and the animal-head standard shown here are part of the 416 copper objects from the Chalcolithic hoard, making the treasure the largest group of copper objects ever found in the ancient Near East. The hoard has provided invaluable insight into the study of ancient metalworking and has greatly expanded our knowledge of the art and iconography of the Chal- colithic age. The standard measures 27.5 centimeters long. (IDAM 61-88) 156 IIIII 1( Al. AR( IIA!LO1.1,I'I/I.

From the Early and Middle Bronze Ages (3150-1550 B.C.) come the superbly burnished and carinated bowl from Beth-yera., the human-headed Tell el-Yehudiyeh ware jug from Jericho, a pottery house-model from Arad, and gold peg figurines from recent excavations at Tell Gezer. During the 1930 to 1931 excavations of the cemetery at Jericho this unusual anthropomorphic vase was uncovered and soon became known as a masterpiece of Canaanite ceramic art. It is a high-footed krater ofa distinctive pottery type known as Tell el-Yehudiyeh ware, which is characterized by a series ofpunctures in the clay that are filled in with white chalk. Frequently the punctures are arranged to form geometric patterns of decoration. In this case they have been ingeniously used to suggest hair, eyebrows, andbeard. The face represented is almost a caricature with exaggerated facial features of curving eyebrows that extend down to the cheekbones, a long thin nose, a narrow beard, and huge schematic ears that also serve as handles to the vase. The vase is 21 centimeters high and dates from the eighteenth to seventeenth centuries B.C.

The jewelry from Petrie's excavations at the latter site is the finest to have emerged from Canaanite levels and includes pendants, bracelets, and even ornamental flies similar to those conferred for valor among the Egyptian military during the Eighteenth Dynasty. The larger-than-life, pottery, anthropoid sarcophagus from Deir el-Bala (nearly fifty have been found to date) reflects somewhat eerily the practice common in the Egyptian Delta of burial in cartonnage coffins. Similar finds have been made at Lachish, Tell el-Farcah South, and Beth-shean, but those from Deir el-Balab are especially impressive. This basalt orthostat was originally incorporated into the right doorjamb of the entrance to the large Orthostat Temple in the Lower City of Hazor. The orthostat was not found in situ; it was discovered in a deep pit under the front wall of the temple porch where it had been deliberately buried under a pile ofstones. The profile figure ofa reclining lion has been expertly carved in bas-relief on one of the long sides of the slab while its head, chest, and front paws have been carved almost in the round, creating a three-dimensional effect, on one of the short ends. The crouching lion would have presented a powerful image to the temple visitor The orthostat is 91 by 182 by 60 centimeters and is dated to the mid-second millennium B.c.

Stylized eyebrows frame the large empty eye sockets, while the nose, mouth, and pointed chin are more delicately shaped in relief The ears, which protrude from the sides of the head, were separately modeled in clay and attached to the mask. Because the mask is only 14 centi- meters high, and therefore could not have been worn by an adult, it may have been used to cover the face of a statue or was displayed by hanging from some surface. Three pairs ofholes, one at the top a.nd two at the sides, were used to attach the mask. It was found in area C at the site and dates between the fourteenth and twelfth centuries lH.. (IDAM 67-:1.95) Some fifty anthropoid sarcophagi were dis- covered during excavations of the cemetery at Beth shean. This lid is one of a few that were represented in the exaggerated manner that has been called the grotesque style. The facial features and decorations on the clay lid were created by both modeling and appliqud techniques. A headdress of two horizontal bands above a row of projecting knobs has been compared to the headgear worn by the Sea Peoples depicted on the Egyptian reliefs of Ramesses III. The clay lid dates to the twelfth or eleventh centuries B.c. and is 63.5 centimeters long.

Alongside the delicately carved, semiprecious gemstones bearing Hebrew names are the sculptural ivory carvings from Megiddo, which in turn differ com- pletely from the only slightly later ivory inlays unearthed at Samaria.

Yet despite the paucity of remains (including a bronze bowl, an incense shovel, and an Achaemenid rhyton, which are in the exhibit) we know that the foundations of normative Judaism were being laid at this time. The transition from Hellenism to Roman hegemony can be felt in the contrast of such wonderful works as a bronze and silver panther from Avdat and classical sculptural works in bronze, stone, and ivory after the victory of Pompey in 63 B.c. From this later period the most impressive work of art is the bronze statue of Hadrian from Tell Shalem near Beth-shean.

I, Mercurios, son of Alexander, dedicate [this statue] during my priesthood." The date given in the inscription corresponds to A.D. 210/211. The cult of Nemesis was widely practiced in Roman Egypt; soldiers may have introduced the cult to inhabitants of Israel in their movement to pagan urban centers along the Mediterranean coast. It is believed that a temple dedicated to Nemesis existed somewhere between Ashkelon and Gaza. The sculpture measures 48 by 53 centimeters.

The artistic and reli- gious inroads made by the Romans are symbolized by two sculptures of divinities: Kore (Persephone) from Samaria, and Nemesis in the form of a griffin from Erez, in the vicinity of which there was believed to have been a temple raised in her honor, possibly by Roman soldiers. Indigenous Jewish art from the Second Temple Period (539 B.C.-A.D. 70) includes a superb multiple-nozzle pottery lamp and temple furnishings from a synagogue at En-gedi. There are also mosaics from the sites of Kis- sufim and Beth-shean, with the latter supplying a detailed depiction of an ark with Torah screen, menorot, shofar, and incense shovel. From the remains ofa sixth-century-A.D. synagogue at En-gedi come two unusual bronze objects. Although the solidly cast menorah is rather crudely made, it is important because it is one of only two three-dimensional menorahs that have been discovered in ancient synagogues. The function ofthe pyxis, which is ham- mered in two parts out ofa sheet of bronze, is unknown. The objects were discovered next to a semicircular niche in the north wall of the synagogue, which housed the Ark of the Law. Both are 14.5 centimeters high.

Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judea from A.D. 26 to 36, is known from the New Testament as the person who authorized the execution offJesus and is also mentioned in the works of the ancient historian Josephus. Until the dis- covery of this inscribed stone from Caesarea, however, no contemporaneous archaeological, numismatic, or epigraphic evidence corroborated his existence. This unique stone was found during the excavations of the theater at Caesarea, which had been built by Herod the Great and later trans- formed into a fortress. It had been reused in a reconstruc- tion phase as a step, and part of its inscription was dam- aged at that time. The remaining Latin inscription reads: ". .. TIBERIEUM . . [PO]NTIUS PILATUS/. . . [PRAEF]ECTUS IUDA[EA]E." It probably related to a building (the Tiberieum) that was erected by Pontius Pilate in honor of the Emperor Tiberius. The stone measures 82 by 65 centimeters. (IDAM 61-529) "Hither were brought/The bones of Uzziah/King ofJudah./Do not open!" This funer- ary inscription is the only known ancient artifact that contains the name of a king of Judah. It was found over fifty years ago in the Russian Orthodox monastery on the Mount of Olives and there is nothing known of its original provenance other than it was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century. This Aramaic inscription of Uzziah, who is described as a leper king in 2 Chronicles 26:23, dates between the first century B.c. and the first century A.D. rather than to the time of Uzziah (the eighth century B.c.). Uzziah's remains may have been removed from their original grave during the expansion of Jerusalem at the end of the Hasmonean period or during the reign of Herod the Great. This stone plaque, which is approximately 35 centimeters square and 6 centi- meters thick, probably was used to seal the new burial niche or was set in the wall above the niche.

L Lt, " I FI r ~?c~- Excavated near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, this first-century-B.C. stone originally formed part of a parapet on a building at the southwest corner of the Temple enclosure. Its inscription reads "to the place of trumpeting" and is fol- lowed by another word, of which only two letters and part of a third have sur- vived. The complete translation can be read several ways depending on the identification of the final letter. One suggestion is "to the place of trumpeting to de[clarej]," which may refer to the tradition recorded by Josephus of a priest who sounded a trumpet to mark the approach and close of the Sabbath. Another reading, "to the place of trum- peting to dis[tinguish]," may reflect a reference in the Mishnah of blowing the trumpet three times to announce the separation of the Sabbath from the rest of the week. The stone measures 31 by 84 by 26 centimeters. (IDAM 78-1415) mportant epigraphic material is Salso on display. The earliest inscribed piece is the "House of God" ostracon from the excavations at ancient Arad; in the final line the writer refers to the 'Beit Yahweh," which is the oldest refer- ence to the Temple in Jerusalem. From the early sixth century B.C. are a number of semiprecious seals providing valuable onomastic information. One in par- ticular names an unknown princess, Maadana, a daughter of a king of Judah. From the Second Temple Period comes an inscription mentioning the "place of trumpeting, that point along the south- ern edge of the Temple platform from which the start and close of the Sabbath were announced by a trumpet blast. A first-century-B.C. epitaph for the leper King Uzziah of Judah (769-733 B.c.) carries an Aramaic injunction not to open the king's ossuary. A block from Caesarea mentioning Pontius Pilate is the sole contemporary evidence cor- roborating his existence. The Siloam hoard, a trove of Jewish and Tyrian shekels, includes coins dated shanat aleph and shanat beth signifying years one and two (66 and 67 A.D.) of the First Jewish War. Finally, several of the Dead Sea Scrolls-a parchment from Masada containing portions of the Psalms, and the Habakkuk commentary from Qumran-serve as a coda to the exhibition. -.~~r ;I V .t ~1 wr' _ rn4' - w *l~y? er 1'I ?~ Found during the excavations of the fortress of Masada, these manuscript fragments contain portions of the book of Psalms. They date to before A.D. 74. This beautifully crafted, bronze pyxis was pur- chased by an antiquities dealer in 1950. At that time it contained some forty Tyrian and Jewish shekels and was believed to have been found in the Siloam area of Jerusalem. Many of the coins were individually sold by the dealer until Professor A. Reifenberg purchased the pyxis and remaining twelve coins. The association of these particular coins is significant because it indicates that Jewish shekels were circulated at the same time as late Tyrian shekels, a fact that was unknown to numismatists previously. The pyxis is 9 centimeters high and has a diameter of 7.5 centimeters.

Allfour sides of this first-century-B. c. stone vessel were elaborately decorated with architectural facades and doorways. The unfinished back and some of the details missing from the short sides indicate that the decoration was abandoned before completion and that the ossuary was probably never sold. Its incomplete state, however, reveals the various stages of the stonecutter's work. Still visible are the initialfine incisions made by the artist to delineate the area to be dec- orated, which were followed by the carving of the main lines of the design, and then the completion of the details and final polishing. The vaulted lid appears to be slightly larger than the ossuary base and was probably originally created for another similar ossuary. The ossuary without the lid measures 47 by 81 by 40.5 centimeters. (IDAM 74-1508) 3 any of Israel's renowned and most painstakingly Sexcavated tells figure prominently in the exhibition. Indeed, so many of the objects are from controlled ex- cavations that it has been possible to organize a number of the displays as archaeological clusters, the chief ones being the ossuaries from Azor, I the copper treasure from Nahal Mishmar, the shrine of the stelae from Hazor, glass and pottery from a tomb at Mishmar Haemek, and do- mestic and funerary material from excavations in Jerusalem. These clusters are important because they provide viewers with context for material that they might otherwise find perplexing. A simple enumeration of the highlights of Treasures of the Holy Land does not con- vey or even hint at the uncan- ny power of this material to evoke in each of us a desire to know more of our cultural and spiritual origins. Perhaps more than any other land, Israel has both welcomed and tolerated diverse cultures, which have left an unmistakable impress in the material record. Much of the oldest material is cultic in nature, but with the coming of the Israelites, the importance of cult waned and the period of personal piety and the written 1 word came to the fore.
