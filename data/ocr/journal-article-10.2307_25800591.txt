<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 5, No. 1, 1991 The Prehistory of Northern Chile: A Synthesis Mario A. Rivera1,2 Northern Chile, part of the south central Andes, consists of two main ecological subareas: extreme northern Chile, including the western valleys, and the Ata cama Desert and oases. Different ecological conditions obtain in each subarea: puna, altiplano, and precordillera in the highlands; valleys, the desert, and oases in the intermediate zone; and coastal environments along the Pacific shores. In prehistoric times, all these environments were very interconnected. There are three different cultural traditions in the local prehistory: the early hunting and gathering tradition (10,000-4000 B.P.), the Chinchorro Tradition (7500-2500 B.P.), and the Altiplano or Andean Tradition (3000-0 B.P.). This proposed sequence is described, with emphasis on the early Chinchorro adap tations, including the important patterns of mummification, and its possible relation to tropical forest groups of the Amazon basin; and the Pre-Tiwanaku and later Tiwanaku and Inca developments, in relation to the circum-Titicaca region. The data presented in the paper are further developed to explore ideas and hypotheses for future research. KEY WORDS: northern Chile; complementarity; Chinchorro; Azapa; Alto Ramirez; Tiwanaku; Inca. INTRODUCTION During the last two decades, there has been considerable research into the archaeology of northern Chile. This has resulted partly from the different mean ing of archaeology and anthropology for an underdeveloped country that is home to many of the living Andean societies.

For instance, the Institute of Anthropology at the Universidad de Concep cion, a leading academic center in the field of anthropology, was completely dismantled in 1973, and the Department of Anthropology of the Universidad de Chile in Santiago was virtually confined to archaeology after 1973. In the north, research at the Universidad del Norte and Universidad Tarapaca was devoted to the study of material culture, without any reference to social con ditions for the living communities. Nonetheless, archaeological research has continued, mainly in the northern part of the country, and is now becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. This, in conjunction with the excellent preservation of organic material in the area, provides important new data for our understanding of the human past in one of the most severe areas of the world. Since the time of Uhle (1919) and Bird (1943, 1946; Bird and Rivera, 1988), there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the archaeology of the whole area, although specific sections of northern Chile have been summarized. [Mostny (1982) gives a general description, Bittmann and others (1979) cover San Pedro de Atacama, and there is a recent compilation by Hidalgo and others (1989).] Archaeological research in northern Chile in recent decades has demon strated the complexity of cultural development there in the last 10,000 years. From the simpler economies of hunters and gatherers, northern Chilean groups built more complex organizations by developing new technologies based on a detailed understanding of the environment. During the Middle and Late periods, sedentism developed toward urbanization, and the development of Tiwanaku and Inca states permitted more stable societies. Overall, it is the history of how northern Chilean people developed particular strategies to adapt to harsh and inhospitable environments. This is a remarkable process that can still be studied among present-day Andean groups. The prehistory of northern Chile also rep resents an experience based on the past from which we could learn for planning future development, particularly for those sciences dealing with arid environ ments. Andean society in the south central Andes developed a complex socio political system, based on ecological diversity, through a long period of experimentation. In the late 1960s, Murra tried to explain both the high productivity of precolumbian Andean people and the fact that the most people lived in the highlands. He suggested that these achievements resulted from one ethnic group or state making simultaneous use of multiple ecozones (Murra, 1975). Ecolog ical complementarity, or vertical control, consists of complementary production in different specialized environments by one sociopolitical system. In the south</page><page sequence="3">Prehistory of Northern Chile 3 central Andes, access by late, post-Tiwanaku, highland groups to the western valleys on the Pacific has been documented ethnohistorically (for example, Cuneo Vidal, 1977; Murra, 1975; Masuda, 1980; Pease, 1980) and corrobo rated by archaeological research (Disselhoff, 1974; Flores Espinoza, 1969; Fujii, 1980; Lumbreras, 1974; Onuki, 1980; Trimborn, 1975). However, beyond establishing the presence of highlanders in the coastal valleys, we do not understand the entire process and how such complexity was institutionalized and structured within a specific socioeconomic organization. Within this framework, the vertical archipelago represents the climax sit uation in later times. It consists of a network of colonies directly and perma nently related to a core area and located along the gradients toward the eastern and western lowlands. Murra's definition of the vertical archipelago emphasizes the anthropological aspect, that is, the participation of ethnic groups within a larger socioeconomic and political system, known from written sources. It has been applied to Inca administration in the Late Period. In the last decade, archaeology has tried to define this system and to understand it as a process. Thus, pre-Inca research has been a high priority, in order to unveil the process of developments crucial for Andean prehistory. Archaeological recognition of colonies?from material culture, including technology, settlement patterns, iconography, and bioindicators?is still under debate. A few clues are particularly interesting for Tiwanaku times (Mujica et al., 1983). On a general level, Tiwanaku remains (ceramics, textiles, stone sculpture, woodwork, bone, and metalwork) show a common technology and iconography. Their association with sites in the coastal valleys could indicate that we are dealing with a colony settlement. In theory, a permanent colony, could be reflected in settlements with intensive occupation with middens deep enough to dem onstrate long-term occupation; work areas or workshops showing a heavy investment of energy, such as agricultural terraces and irrigation canals; and cemeteries associated with dwelling sites and of clear Tiwanaku burial pat tern (stylistic offerings). The burials can also be identified biologically as Tiwanaku (Dittmar et al., 1988). Overall, economic complementarity, vertical archipelago, and colonies related to the circum-Titicaca core area represent important areas for future research. On the other hand, a peripheral population could become a colony by con tinuous dependency on the core area. Murra could distinguish this characteristic clearly in the ethnohistoric records, particularly the administrative visitas of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Murra, 1975). For him, the important point</page><page sequence="4">4 Rivera in his "vertical model" is that the colonists feel that they are part of the core area and they probably keep their rights in their place of origin. Some indicators of such ethnic affiliation could be access to goods produced in the highlands (which can be recovered by archaeological excavations); the presence of ceramics manufactured in the core area of the altiplano, of which the paste, surface finish, clays, and iconography are very distinc tive; and the presence of ceremonial structures built following altiplanic patterns. It would also be of interest to examine the ideological basis of prehispanic cultural development in this area, which can be approached through the study of Andean myths. We assume that some kind of identification developed between peripheral settlers and residents of the core area through common ide ological grounds, and this may represent one of the foundations of the economic and political organization during Tiwanaku and Inca times. The myths of origin still recalled by Andean people emphasize three aspects: the importance of Lake Titicaca, in particular, and all water sources in general, including the Pacific Ocean, as the places where creation occurred; feelings of both fear and respect for everything that comes from the tropical forest in the east; and the different mythological characterizations of solar deities, which are typical of Inca and probably Tiwanaku, as opposed to the religious practices of earlier agrarian groups. The latter include iconographic motifs based on trophy heads, human like felines, hallucinogens, and the concept of duality, where two complemen tary parts oppose each other. More effort should also be devoted to the study of mobility patterns. These were quite institutionalized in the Andean area and could have implications for the origins of the Andean tradition. They might also contribute to our knowl edge of Amazon basin prehistory, by reconstructing its early cultural process from marginal areas. The study of the Chinchorro tradition could represent a starting point in this regard. Recently, taking advantage of the excellent preservation of organic mate rial in northern Chile, we have been involved in developing new bioanthropo logical strategies. Research into paleoenvironmental adaptations and population studies has focused upon the following. Nutritional Patterns. A team including Aufderheide, Kelley, and Tieszen is working with strontium and calcium values, as well as carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen isotopes, to ascertain whether groups used hunting-gathering, marine, pastoral, or agricultural subsistence strategies. Studies on Contamination. These include data on pneumonia frequencies for populations from 4000 to 1000 B.P., arsenic, dust, and smoke exposure,</page><page sequence="5">Prehistory of Northern Chile 5 and other environmental agents of contamination. They may indicate adaptive processes to new environments and could also provide data related to mobility, group size, and density. Population Genetics (Including Craniometrical Distances and Genetic Distances Based on Blood Groups). One of the most exciting possibilities is using DNA to define ethnic entities, their antiquity, and other character istics. THE GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING Northern Chile extends almost 1500 km, from about 18 to 27?S; it is also known as the Arid North because of the Atacama Desert. The area is part of the Andean cultural area and is thus closely tied to circum-Titicaca develop ments. According to the Paracas Conference (1979), northern Chile is part of the South Central Andes, which also includes the area around Lake Titicaca, the eastern valleys of Bolivia and northwestern Argentina, and the southern altiplano of Bolivia (Fig. 1). Northern Chile can be divided into two areas: extreme northern Chile, or the western valleys (PNUD, 1979), and the desert and oases of Atacama, or circum-puneha (Fig. 2). Extreme Northern Chile This area is closely tied to the highland environment that predominates in most of southern Peru and the Bolivian altiplano. Because of its proximity to these zones, cultural events are also related to the circum-Titicaca area. Extreme northern Chile is characterized by a diversity of ecological niches. One of the most interesting is the presence of valleys with permanent water, which acted in the past, and still do today, as corridors between the Bolivian highlands and the Pacific coast. The Azapa valley was intensely occupied during pre-Hispanic times and provides a master sequence for the area (Rivera, 1977, 1987). Four ecozones can be distinguished in extreme northern Chile: the alti plano, the precordillera, the valleys, and the coast. Extreme northern Chile is closely related to puna and altiplano environ ments; in the east, the altiplano is also related to the ceja de selva (the contact zone with the jungle) and the tropical forest. On the altiplano, the economy is based on herding and agriculture; below it are various environmental niches that yield different products. The precordilleran basins at 3000 m asl (above sea level) have a pronounced rainy season, which permits more intensive agricul ture, as well as camelid and sheep pastoralism. At lower altitudes, the head waters of the main streams start to flow toward the coast. It is important to note</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 1. The south central Andean area, including northern Chile. that these environments at different altitudes are interconnected, and since early times, people have seen them as a single geographical framework. The socio political and economic system able to exploit this complexity must have resulted from long experimentation, based on the principle of complementarity. It was in this environment that the Chinchorro Tradition (ca. 7000-2500 B.P.) and the Altiplano Tradition (beginning ca. 3000 B.P.) developed.</page><page sequence="7">Prehistory of Northern Chile 7 13 Pampa Tamarugal IO 1 Oasis Altiplano Precordillera Interandean Basins mm Coast I 1 Desert 5?j Springs Semi Arid North ] Fig. 2. Main ecozones and archaeological sites of northern Chile.</page><page sequence="8">8 Rivera Desert and Oases of Atacama South of Tiliviche is an extremely arid area with no precipitation (because of the Humboldt cold current). This is the Atacama Desert, which includes, from north to south, the following ecological zones: the salt puna, the inter mediate region, and the coast. Salt Puna. This reaches an altitude of 3000 m asl in the north (representing the altiplano of extreme northern Chile) and drops toward the south, becoming more salty and arid. The landscape is characterized by enormous areas of arid flat land, a sort of high plateau between Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina. Extremes of temperature and aridity prevent year-round occupation above this altitude. South of 26?S, the upper limit of agriculture descends to 2000 m, because of differences in climate, soil, weather, rainfall, and latitude. The Intermediate Region. This is a flat area between the puna and the coast. In the north of the plateau is the Pampa del Tamarugal, which is char acterized by wild tamarugos (Prosopis sp.), a perennial bush that survives on ground water; the Pampa del Tamarugal ends south of 21 ?S. The Atacama Desert then predominates for a distance of about 1000 km from north to south. It is a flat region and one of the driest in the world, being interrupted only by the valley of the Rio Loa, the only river that drains into the Pacific. There are scattered oases which make human settlement possible. Important archaeolog ical sites have been recorded from oases including San Pedro de Atacama, Gua tacondo, Pica, and Calama (Bittmann et al., 1979; Meighan and True, 1980; Zlatar, 1984). The Coast. This is another favorable zone for prehistoric settlements. From about the latitude of Pisagua to Taltal, the coast is high and steep, with only a few good bays suitable for navigation. The climate is warm and quite stable all year round and the existence of springs made human presence possible in the past. Archaeological sites have been studied at Pisagua, Caleta Huelen, Anto fagasta, and Taltal, among others (Bird, 1943; Uhle, 1919; Nunez etal., 1975). CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT Elsewhere (Rivera, 1975, 1977), I have proposed a model for the chro nology and cultural development of northern Chile. This model is comparable to those for the central Andes of Rowe (1962) and Lumbreras (1981) among others, which have defined three main pan-Andean developments?the Early, Middle, and Late Horizons. The Early Horizon consists chiefly of the Chavin development, the Middle is equated with Tiwanaku-Wari, and the Late with Inca. For northern Chile, the Middle and Late Horizons correspond to the Mid dle Intermediate and Late Periods. My periodization is essentially chronologi cal, while Rowe defined his within two major stages called Preceramic and</page><page sequence="9">Prehistory of Northern Chile 9 Ceramic. The second column in Fig. 3 contains the central Andes sequence, with the main periods of the Titicaca basin and Azapa valley in the next two columns. The Azapa valley provides the master sequence for northern Chile. The sequence in the Azapa valley begins with the hunting-gathering tra dition of the Early Period.

Periodization of prehistoric northern Chile.</page><page sequence="10">10 Rivera period (ca. 8000-6000 B.P.), we can see a process of differentiation, defining the Transition I period. Some groups became coastal fishers and some gatherers in the valleys. They probably practiced transhumance that involved hunting in the puna and herding domestic animals in the quebradas (or ravines) as well as some hunting and gathering. Nunez and Moragas (1977-1978) have suggested that guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) were domesticated by 8800 B.P. at Tiliviche Quebrada. This period saw also the appearance of the Chinchorro tradition, representing specialized hunters adapted to the coastal environment. At Aragon, Nunez and Zlatar (1976) have recorded their coexistence with the previous hunting tradition. Sedentism, as well as the domestication of plants and animals, began by the end of Transition I. We do not yet know how the domestication of camelids took place, but Hesse (1982) found evidence of domesticated llamas and alpacas by 4885 B.P. at Puripica in the Atacama Desert. Domesticated plants such as maize are controversial, but from farther south, at the site of Pichasca, there is stratigraphic and C-14 evidence that maize was being grown by 4700 B.P. (Ri vera, 1980, p. 105). Less secure data come from the sites of Tiliviche 1-b, Camarones-14, and Quiani, with radiocarbon dates averaging 6500 B.P. During the Initial Period (6000-3500 B.P.), the Chinchorro tradition developed fully. I have suggested elsewhere (Rivera, 1975) that this tradition had a trans-Andean connection, probably to the tropical lowlands. This period saw important changes as part of the process of sedentism. Agriculture become more productive, and by the end of the period, crops such as beans (Phaseolus), hot peppers (Capsicum), calabashes, manioc, maize, quinoa, and sweet pota toes, among others, were cultivated in the Azapa valley. Textiles, especially of cotton, and basketry are known from several sites, particularly Quiani (5630 B.P.) and Playa Miller 8 (4090 B.P.). During Transition II (3500-2600 B.P.), full sedentism is found in northern Chile. The earliest documented village site is Chiu Chiu-200, in the Atacama Desert, dated to 2860 B.P., but several others are known by 2600 B.P. (Alto Ramirez, Caserones, Tulor, and Calar). Clusters of dwellings indicate the pro cess of village development at sites such as Caleta Huelen-42 (3780 B.P.) and Tulan (3710 B.P.). After about 3000 B.P., a new tradition, with traits typical of the circum Titicaca area, arose in the coastal valleys?the Altiplanic or Andean tradition, which persisted through the Intermediate and Late Periods up to recent times. The Altiplanic tradition is associated with the first ceramics and woolen textiles: pottery has been reported as early as 2990 B.P. from Pichalo and 3060 B.P. from Camarones-15 (Rivera, 1984b), associated with polychrome woollen tex tiles. In the Azapa region, pottery, textiles, and ornaments of gold and copper have been dated to 2750 B.P. at site AZ-71 and 2850 B.P. at Hakenasa (San toro, 1981; Santoro and Nunez, 1987).</page><page sequence="11">Prehistory of Northern Chile 11 The Early Intermediate period [2600-1400 B.P. (500 B.C.-A.D. 500)] includes most of the Alto Ramirez development. This phase witnessed the development of an economy based on surplus goods produced in the lowland Pacific valleys, such as maize, pepper, potatoes, and guano, which comple mented the highland production of camelid by-products (meat, wool, jerky), quinoa and chunu (a kind of freeze-dried potato). In this paper, I suggest that the bases of the later Andean development in the western lowlands and through out northern Chile are found in this period. Local Tiwanaku and Inca variants are found in the area during the Middle and Late Intermediate and the Late Periods. THE HUNTING AND GATHERING TRADITION Little is known about the early hunting traditions. A transhumance model has been used in those areas with a variety of seasonal resources available from complementary ecozones, east-west across the Andes; such transhumance would involve long-distance seasonal movements from a major camp base in a more stable area, possibly on the coast. However, this interaction between the coast and the altiplano has not been demonstrated for the early period in northern Chile. Our main problem is the lack of stratigraphic sites with comparable data in both zones. I will present below up-to-date information regarding the most important sites in both subareas, with some tentative conclusions. It is important to maintain a clear distinction between dry and salt punas in the highlands, since the hunting and gathering tradition developed primarily within these zones or was closely related to them. No Paleoindian remains have yet been found. This is an objective for future research. Santoro and Nunez (1987) recognize three stages for the hunting and gath ering tradition, which they refer to as Early Archaic, Middle, and Late Archaic. Early Archaic (ca. 10,000-7000 B.P.) developed in both the dry and salt punas. The earliest remains are from Tuina, a shelter near Calama in the Atacama Desert, dated to 10,820 B.P. ? 630 years (SI-3112) (Santoro and Nunez, 1987, p. 67). The site yielded obsidian artifacts and a few camelid bones, suggesting the possibility of a summer hunting camp. San Lorenzo, a cave near the oasis of Toconao with early dates of 10,400 B.P. ? 130 years (N-3423) and 9960 B.P. ? 125 years (N-242), seems comparable (Santoro and Nunez, 1987, p. 91). The finds from these and related sites [such as Chulqui (Sinclaire, 1985)] indicate hunting and gathering economies centered around the oasis zones, with seasonal movement to the puna. The dry puna farther north saw a similar, but slightly later, development dated between 9500 and 8000 B.P. The most characteristic sites are Las Cue</page><page sequence="12">12 Rivera vas, Hakenasa, Patapatane, and Tojo-Tojone (Santoro and Nunez, 1987, p. 67). The lithic assemblage includes stemmed triangular projectile points and thick lanceolate points. According to Santoro and Nunez (1987), this point may have evolved into a lanceolate point with small notches near the base, which is asso ciated with simple bone points in the later stages. The data are also incomplete for the salt puna. There are a couple of ra diocarbon dates of about 7900 B.P. but the cultural traits have not really been defined. The lithic assemblage comprises triangular points, retouched flake knives, scrapers, manos with red pigment, and obsidian tools. The hunting and gathering tradition seems to have reached its climax by 5500-5000 B.P., using a diversity of habitats in the altiplano through more specialized economic activities. This is reflected in the variety of small hunting tools, namely, rhomboidal, lanceolate, and triangular points, bead ornaments, and extensive naturalistic rock art. According to Santoro and Nunez (1987), the upper levels of Hakenasa contain early fiber-tempered pottery, basal notched triangular points, and an exceptional gold disk. This represents the final development of the hunting and gathering tradition before the Formative. It coincides with the development of Alto Ramirez Phase I in the western valleys and provides good evidence of the early [2850 B.P. ? 200 years (1-13229)] altiplanic tradition at 4000 m asl. This date complements those from Pinuta cave, in the precordilleran zone at 3600 m asl, which also yielded fiber-tempered pottery [2540 B.P. ? 180 years (1-12834), 2520 B.P. + 90 years (M2833) (Santoro and Nunez, 1987, p. 91)]. In the salt puna to the south, there are also sites of the final stage of the hunting and gathering tradition. Tulan 52, Calarcoco, Puripica, and Tambillo represent the development of a specialized seasonal transhumance involving the salt puna, the oases, and the middle course of the Loa river. They have semi permanent circular dwellings and seem to be based on an incipient pastoral economy related to camelid domestication (Hesse, 1982). We believe that these hunters and gathers moved around seasonally between the high puna and the marginal areas, over long periods of time. In later times, animal butchering became a predominant activity, possibly as a result of a specialization of avail able resources. Movement thus related to ecozones outside the puna on both sides of the Andes. By 7000 B.P., these transhumant movements may have given rise to sea sonal migrations from the tropical valleys east of the Titicaca area and the estab lishment of base camps on the Pacific coast. These could have resulted in the first Chinchorro migrations from the Amazon basin, as apparently found at the sites of Huachichocana and Inca Cueva in northwestern Argentina (Fernandez, 1974).</page><page sequence="13">Prehistory of Northern Chile 13 THE CHINCHORRO TRADITION The Chinchorro tradition comprises a unique cultural development which occurred on the northern Chilean coast from about 18 to 24?S. Among the most important characteristics of this tradition are artificial treatment of bodies (mummification); use of spear-throwers; copper, gold, and silver metallurgy; cotton textiles; sophisticated basketry; and, at the end of the tradition, the appearance of experimental pottery. All the sites, with the probable exception of Aragon, are on the coast. The most representative ones are Play a Miller-8 (PLM-8), Chinchorro, El Morro, Camarones-14 (CAM-14), Camarones-15 (CAM-15), Quiani-7 (QUI-7), Playa Miller-7 (PLM-7), Pisagua Viejo, Patillos, Bajo Molle, Canastos-3, Caleta Huelen-42 (CaH-42), Antofagasta-Hipodromo, and possibly Quiani-2 (QUI-2) and Taltal (Fig. 4). The Chinchorro people thus represent a coastal adaptation that includes some elements of the tropical complex. Of the latter, hallucino genic equipment (trays, bone tubes, boxes, and spatulae for snuff) is important, as are head ornaments made of plant fibers and the feathers of tropical birds, of very delicate and complex manufacture. The Chinchorro people practiced the oldest mummification procedure known in America, with C-14 dates of 7810 to 2480 B.P. (Table 1). Uhle (1922) defined three types of body preparation: (i) Type I?simple preparation, whereby the body was usually extended, tied and covered with mats and clay (e.g., QUI-7, CAM-15); (ii) Type II?complicated preparation, with desiccation and evisceration of the body, which is refilled with straw, human hair, sticks, and secondary reconstitution, including a clay mask and wig (e.g., PLM-8, Chinchorro, Pisagua Viejo, Patillos); and (iii) Type III, extended bodies covered with clay and sand and wrapped in mats. Bittmann and Munizaga (1976, 1979), who have studied the Chinchorro mummies most intensively, also follow Uhle's classification and propose that Type II mummies are the oldest. The Chinchorro tradition can be divided into three phases based on chro nology, technological development, and cultural associations (Fig. 5, Table I). Phase I (Chinchorro I). This is characterized by extended bodies, some with the orbital cavities filled with clay and plaster clay coated on the face. Most known sites are small cemeteries. The subsistence technology consists of shell fishhooks, lines, weights, and harpoons. There is some basketry and cot ton textiles. This phase reflects the hunting and gathering activities of Transition I. Characteristic sites are CAM-14, Quiani and Morro, with an average date of 6550 B.P. (Table II).</page><page sequence="14">14 Rivera CHINCHORRO SITES NORTHERN CHILE Swig;! Fig. 4. Distribution of Chincorro sites in northern Chile. Phase II (Chinchorro II). During this phase, more sites are found along the coast, perhaps reflecting an increase in population. The most characteristic trait is the complicated mummification, which is found at sites such as Chin chorro, PLM-8, El Morro, QUI, Pisagua Viejo-2, Patillos, Bajo Molle, Ara gon, and CaH-42. Dwelling sites and cemeteries are larger and more intensively</page><page sequence="15">Prehistory of Northern Chile 15 Table I.

Intermediate Transition II Initial Transition I Chinchorro III Chinchorro II Chinchorro I used. Besides basketry and mats, atlatls (spear-throwers), and tools of copper and gold are known. Phase II is dated between 5500 and 4000 B.P. Phase III (Chinchorro III). This has both extended and flexed bodies par tially covered with clay and sand, which may mean a simplification of the ear lier mummification techniques. Baskets were very finely made and textiles were improved by the introduction of the belt-loom; wool was now used, in addition to cotton. New techniques like "repp" (a ribbed or corded textile) produced geometric designs in the direction of the weft. Hallucinogenic equipment, tur bans, and head ornaments are more common. The Chinchorro people became less dependent on the sea with the introduction of new cultigens such as manioc and quinoa. Later in the phase, experimental pottery appeared, characterized by a mixed sand-and-algal temper (mainly at PLM-7). The most representative sites of this phase, which dates between 4000 and 2500 B.P., are PLM-7, CAM 15, QUI-7, Los Canastos, and possibly Pisagua (Fig. 4). The Chinchorro people were probably organized in small groups with a subsistence based on fishing and gathering. By the end of Chinchorro III, there was some experimentation with crops other than squash and cotton: pallar, qui noa, sweet potato, manioc, and possibly maize (Rivera, 1980; Nunez and Mor agas, 1977-1978; Williams, 1980; Bonavia and Grobman, 1989). Social groups may have functioned like present-day fishing communities, wherein there is an emphasis on sea-oriented activities but some specialization may occur. Technological development is also related to economic activities and rit uals. Rituals and beliefs connected with the dead were quite sophisticated. Complicated mummification, deformation of the skull, and, perhaps, trephin ing, along with an excellent knowledge of anatomy are noteworthy (Allison et al., 1984). Movement from one place to another also played an important role in the process of adjusting to the coastal environment.

At the latter site, plastered floors made of clay and sea weed indicate rather more permanent residence. Extended burials were found under the floors (Zlatar, 1983) (Fig. 6). Chinchorro settlements are characterized by clustered circular houses. At</page><page sequence="18">18 Rivera B. Fig. 6. Schematic representations of Chinchorro houses from Acha (A) and Caleta Huelen 42 (B). (Based on Munoz, 1982; Zlatar, 1983; Llagostera, 1989.) Caleta Huelen (CaH-42), at the mouth of the Loa River near the coast, are houses dated to 4780 B.P. ? 100 years (GaK-3546) and 3780 B.P. ? 90 years (GaK-3545). The houses are semisubterranean, circular structures of stones, with a series of superimposed floors with burials beneath them (Fig. 6). The structures are arranged around a central courtyard, which was probably the cen ter of domestic activities. Zlatar (1987) considers them to represent semiper manent dwellings, because of the superposition of the occupational floors. Similar features have been found at Acha and Quiani, near the Azapa valley (Munoz, 1982; Dauelsberg, 1974). The Chinchorro people were probably organized as bands of four or five families, living in the few places along the coast with fresh water, such as Camarones, El Morro, Chinchorro, Pisagua, and Playa Miller. At Camarones,</page><page sequence="19">Prehistory of Northern Chile 19 there are indications that several family groups, and even several bands, coex isted at the same site. A major research problem is the origins of the Chinchorro tradition. I have suggested elsewhere (Rivera, 1975, 1984a) that there was an actual migration of people from the tropical forest and that, during the earliest stages of the Chinchorro development, these people coexisted with people from the old Andean hunting and gathering tradition. Early dwelling sites as Tulan-52, which is similar to Caleta Huelen (CaH-42) and Acha, could represent contact with Chinchorro immigrants. In my view, this adaptive model for the Chinchorro people is supported by biological as well as ecological evidence. According to Holdridge's model of tropical life-zone systems (1959; Holdridge et al.9 1971), the desert zones of northern Chile represent an extreme of the tropical life-zone chain. This approach is particularly useful for the analysis of tropical vegetation and the possibility of people moving from one specific ecosystem to another. Holdridge defined each zone as a two-dimensional hexagon based on mean annual precip itation and mean annual biotemperature. All of the zones form a mosaic in which life zones are classified on three levels: by climate, by local environ mental conditions, and by actual vegetation or land use. As Holdridge and oth ers (1971) explain, on its primary level the system is a climatic classification, but each life zone is also considered to be a first-order ecosystem characterized by groups of associations related by climatic factors, including human activi ties. This is therefore a bioclimatic classification which is useful for understand ing human migrations. Ecologically speaking, it means that groups of people could overcome the apparent barriers and reach the Pacific coast. The mechan ics of this model may have involved seasonal, long-distance transhumance, along tropical valleys eastward through the Titicaca basin. An alternative route was probably from the intermediate area (Jujuy, Salta, Tarija, Mojos), which is marginal to Titicaca, down to the Pacific coast, where they established base camps. Other biological evidence is also relevant here (Rivera and Rothhammer, 1986). Craniometrical distances measured on collections from Chinchorro sites of the Pacific coast, the Amazon basin (Sambaquies Cabezuda), and the Andean highlands reveal an increase in distance from the earliest Chinchorro phase (I) to the latest (III), a decrease with respect to the Andean highland collections, and very little distance between Chinchorro and Cabezuda. Multivariate statis tical analyses suggest central Amazonia as the center of dispersion for several waves of population moving southeast to the Atlantic coast (Sambaquies) and southwest to the Andes and Pacific coast. In the case of Chinchorro populations, the craniometrical results support the model of early trans-Andean contacts based on cultural markers (Rivera and Rothhammer, 1986). In fact, the early popu lations of Camarones 14 and Morro 1 appear biologically related to early Bra</page><page sequence="20">20 Rivera zilian groups on the Atlantic coast at about 4000 B.P. This suggests that Chinchorro and Sambaquies Cabezuda could have been descended from com mon ancestors. The pattern of genetic distance among major linguistic groups also seems consistent with the interpretation of archaeological and craniometrical data. Based on seven blood-group system markers (Callegari-Jacques, 1985), Ara wakan groups (Wapishana, for instance) appear to be closely related to Ge speaking people (Cayapo, Kraho, Xavante). If Loukotka (1968) is correct that Ge represents a Paleoamerican language, then Arawak (and Tupi) could relate to the first prehistoric inhabitants of eastern Brazil, who may also be considered as a group using Ge-related language. [See also the work of Rouse (1986) and Brochado (1984).] This is consistent with Lathrap's (1970) model that relates the proto-Arawak both culturally and linguistically to the proto-Tupi. On the other hand, Aymara-Quechua groups show the shortest distance from Arawak, which may indicate that the former originated in the tropical forest from proto Arawak groups. Aymara-Quechua and Arawak have been grouped as one equa torial Andean linguistic family (Greenberg, 1960). Other evidence comes from the identification of a rare red-cell phospho glucomutase variant (PGM-1), defined by Neel (1978) as a "private polymor phism." It has been described by Van der Does and others (1978) for Socaire, an Atacameno village in the high plateau of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, as PGM-1 4Ayml-l. The same variant was reported at a similar fre quency (3-6%) by Neel and others (1977) for PGM-1 lOMac-l-l among the Macushi, by Tchen and others (1978) for the Wayampis of French Guyana, and by Ferrell and others (1980) among the Aymara north of Socaire, where it was reported as PGM-1 4AMY1-1. Ferrell and others (1978) also concluded that another allele of "private polymorphism" type, G6PO-Aymara, occurs among the Aymara of northern Chile but not of western Bolivia. These alleles could be extremely valuable for establishing early contacts between Chinchorro and tropical forest groups. The model contains important problems for future research, relating to the assumed antiquity of human settlement of the tropical lowlands and the role of tropical forest cultures in the formation of Andean civilization. Research with genetic markers and the possibility of DNA reconstruction would be extremely helpful, and, with paleonutritional indicators, will allow us better understanding of patterns of population mobility, environmental adjustment, problems of resi dency and sedentism, and subsistence strategies. THE ANDEAN TRADITION The altiplanic features that developed in the western valleys were different from those of the Atacama Desert. The former seems to have been more directly related to the circum-Titicaca area, forming a constituent part of the civilization</page><page sequence="21">Prehistory of Northern Chile 21 that later centered around the Tiwanaku state; in the desert, influence was indi rect and more symbolic. This situation may have arisen during pre-Tiwanaku times, when altiplanic circum-Titicaca influences are found over a larger area than those of the later Tiwanaku. This period is referred to as Alto Ramirez in both the western valleys and the Atacama Desert. Alto Ramirez The Andean, or Altiplanic, tradition had appeared in northern Chile before the Chinchorro tradition died out. The two coexisted between 1000 and 500 B.C. (3000-2500 B.P.). The Alto Ramirez phase, ca. 1000 B.C.-A.D. 500, is the first stage of the Andean tradition in northern Chile. Geographically, it covers the Azapa valley, Camarones, coastal sites in Iquique, and Caleta Huelen; there are also inland sites such as Tarapaca-40, Caserones, Guatacondo, and San Pedro Atacama (Fig. 7). During this phase, the first influences from the altiplano, particularly the circum-Titicaca area, developed in the coastal valleys, providing the basis for a sociopolitical and economic system based on complementarity. Production of a surplus by new techniques of agriculture and herding made possible an increase in population. These processes were in part responsible for the devel opment of the first villages (Chiu Chiu-200, Azapa 83, Caserones, Guata condo). There were also new technological devices, including atlatls with a rectan gular platform (Rivera and Zlatar, 1982, PI. 2); ornaments of gold and silver, double-shafted spoons [similar to Espoueys' type A-l (1972-1973, p. 83)]; hallucinogen-related tools such as spatulae, boxes, tubes, trays; sophisticated and well-manufactured basketry; and globular and beaker-shaped pottery, gen erally undecorated but with grooved surfaces and sand-grit temper; as well as the introduction of tapestry and lost-warp (kelim) techniques for textiles, and geometric and anthropomorphic designs, some of which seem to be of Pukara affiliation (Rivera, 1977, 1980). Other characteristics of the Alto Ramirez phase include human sacrifice, the cult of the sacrificer, trophy heads, mound for mation for cemeteries, and crops such as quinoa, aji, cotton, beans, squash, and pallar. At Azapa-71, Alto Ramirez burials contained copper and silver ornaments of saurian form (Santoro, 1980), similar to those from Browman's (1980) Asi runi-Pajano style from the circum-Titicaca area. There were also textiles of various techniques, including twining, braided, and kelim, with geometric designs; in design and technique, these are related to the classic Alto Ramirez textiles referred to as Pukara (Fig. 8), which have geometric designs, anthro pomorphic figures, and trophy heads in blue, yellow, and red (Rivera, 1977, p. 43).</page><page sequence="22">22 Rivera ALTO RAMIREZ SITES NORTHERN CHIl E ?31 Fig. 7. Distribution of Alto Ramirez sites in northern Chile. Chronologically, the Alto Ramirez phase can be divided into three: Alto Ramirez I, 1000-500 B.C., contemporaneous with Chinchorro III during Tran sition Period II (Table III); Alto Ramirez II, 500 B.C.-A.D. 300, coincident with the Early Intermediate Period which is defined by the first Tiwanaku influ ences in the western valleys; and Alto Ramirez III, A.D. 300-500 and probably</page><page sequence="23">Prehistory of Northern Chile Fig. 8.

Morro and Pre-Tiwanaku Circum-Titicaca) Middle Intermediate Period Early Intermediate Period Transitional Period II later, coexisting with Tiwanaku regional development, especially Loreto Viejo, Cabuza and Maitas/Chiribaya. Alto Ramirez I correlated with Pre-Classic Pukara of the circum-Titicaca area (Chiripa, Wankarani, Marcavalle, Qaluyu) (Alto Ramirez II is related to classic Pukara). It represents the earliest contact with the Altiplanic Tradition and beginning of the replacement of Chinchorro III phase. In general, it cor responds to Dauelsberg's (1985) Faldas del Morro Complex and Santoro's (1980) Azapa phase. Important sites for this period are Azapa-71 and Azapa 14 (84) with C-14 dates of 3000-2550 B.P. The sequence for Alto Ramirez seems to be corroborated at Tarapaca, where Nunez (1982) has defined three occupational phases from dwelling sites along the Quebrada Tarapaca. At 1000-400 B.C., Tarapaca 6 and 7 and other sites indicate the cultivation of maize, use of early pottery related to altiplano Wankarani, and dwellings built out of canes. Between 400 and 0 B.C. are rectangular dwellings, best represented at Caserones sites Tarapaca 6, 7, and 40-b. The final occupations date A.D. 0-600 and include the ceremonial plaza and defensive wall (Tarapaca 40 A and B) and modeled pottery. Alto Ramirez society was based on an economy different from that of the Chinchorro tradition. Irrigated agriculture produced a surplus which may have resulted in demographic stability. In theory, intensive agriculture also led to the introduction of the complementarity principle. Alto Ramirez people probably viewed the ecological niches in the altiplano, in the valleys, and on the coast as parts of one framework, based on the production of different, but specialized, goods which together created a complex system of resources. This also required a flexible technology which allowed people to maintain their ties to the metrop</page><page sequence="25">Prehistory of Northern Chile 25 olis. The essence of the system was a strict and tightly structured political orga nization, probably based on deities symbolized by the sacrificer. It is highly likely that the Alto Ramirez people also developed a stratified society, including division of labor, professional artisans, and a ruling class, who conducted ter ritorial and economic policies. These developments foreshadow what took place later, during Tiwanaku times. The correspondence between Alto Ramirez and circum-Titicaca develop ment is outlined in Table IV. Late Chiripa society developed more complex centers based on temple storage. According to Mohr (1989), this phase saw the full development of the Yaya Mama religious tradition, which was character ized by a specific stone sculpture of supernatural images associated with the temples, and ritual paraphernalia including ceramic trumpets and ceremonial burners; the supernatural iconography included heads with rayed appendages and vertically divided eyes. The dwellings were rectangular, thatched buildings with double walls of adobe and rounded stones set in mud, with a central open plaza. Other traits include the use of mounds, the presence of snake and frog motifs, cross and checkered cross designs, the tear band and eye ornament, fiber-tempered pottery, relief ring designs, felines depicted full-face with body in profile, and ceramics with red, black, and cream designs outlined by incision. Several of these traits also occur in northern Chile, particularly in the Alto Ramirez phase. For instance, the combination of red, dark blue, and cream on textiles is quite characteristic. Several hats with similar three-step designs have been found with Alto Ramirez phase II artifacts at AZ-70 (Arica) and Caleta Huelen (Rio Loa). The rayed human face adorned with appendages and eyes of different colors is also known among Alto Ramirez materials, particularly tex tiles. Most noteworthy are textile number 9 from the site AZ-70 and one from AZ-121 (Fig. 9). Both textiles have complex designs which contain several elements of the Yaya Mama tradition: human rayed face; stepped designs with Table IV.

Associated with the textiles were fiber-tempered pottery (group II) and Pukara textiles depicting trophy heads in the same fashion as classic Pukara classic red-and-black, incised, pottery designs. These finds represent the peak of Alto Ramirez development. A few traits associated with Alto Ramirez I also occur at the site AZ-71:</page><page sequence="27">Prehistory of Northern Chile 27 serpent ornaments of copper; simple geometric designs on textiles; and disks and plates, probably of symbolic importance (Gonzalez, 1985). In a burial from Playa Miller-7, dated to 2480 B.P. ? 100 years (GaK-5812), the head was fully covered with ornaments, including several small copper serpents and a sort of crown made of small sticks radiating from an inner band. At AZ-71, there were also cases of mummy heads, with packs of dyed wool of several colors and small metal serpent pendants. Farther south, toward the Atacama Desert area, it is also possible to find Yaya Mama traits associated with Alto Ramirez phases. For instance, at Pircas, in Quebrada de Tarapaca, Nunez (1984) reported textiles of Alto Ramirez affil iation comparable to Pukara designs and dated to 2420 B.P. ? 80 years (1-13288). The most outstanding piece depicts a full-face feline with closed mouth and crossed teeth, in a blue, red, and white combination typical of Alto Ramirez phase II. At Camarones-15, a cemetery with both Alto Ramirez and Chinchorro phase III components, Alto Ramirez features include designs in basketry and textiles, such as crosses, human faces, and serpents, which seem to be related to the Pukara culture. At San Pedro de Atacama, as well as the snuff trays related to classic Tiwanaku, several others, particularly those with the motif of a woman with a rounded face and rays coming out of her head, seem to be related to the Yaya Mama tradition. Torres (1987) relates this type of motif to a similar one from Calilegua (Jujuy, Argentina). Textiles from San Pedro de Atacama, Topater (near Calama), Tarapaca, and Camarones are also similar. Along with similarities in design, petroglyphs, geoglyphs, and paint ings, particularly from sites in the Azapa valley, the Atacama Desert, and the Rio Loa, all exhibit common features such as sacrificers, trophy heads, and feline depictions. Mound sites from Azapa and San Pedro de Atacama are also restricted to this time period; the most important are AZ-70 and AZ-71 in Azapa, Conanoxa in the Camarones valley, Caleta Huelen 10, 10 A, and 20 in Rio Loa, and Tchapuchayna in San Pedro de Atacama. In conclusion, the Yaya Mama style is widely distributed in northern Chile (Azapa, Camarones, Pisagua, San Pedro de Atacama, Guatacondo, Pircas, Quebrada Tarapaca). Some scholars have suggested a link between Chiripa and Pukara, and this contact probably reached the Cuzco region, since Mohr pos tulates a relationship between Chiripa and Marcavalle phase D by 650 B.C. The presence of metal disks and plaques at Cuzco, most notably the Doberti disk, supports this suggestion. A similar relationship can be seen between Chiripa and Alto Ramirez. In northwestern Argentina, the most recent research indi cates that the Salta and Jujuy regions might fall within the scope of the Yaya Mama tradition, particularly through the early development of Vaquerias style and, later, the Aguada and related complexes. This could mean that an ideological system controlled the Titicaca region in Pre-Tiwanaku times, and there may have been an earlier expansion out of</page><page sequence="28">28 Rivera Titicaca (Rivera, 1985). This is related to Mohr's Yaya Mama religious tradi tion, in the sense that it represents an ideological system centered in the Titicaca region, but of a much broader scope than the later, true Tiwanaku expansion. This pre-Tiwanaku expansion could also have developed important enclaves in certain strategic areas, such as the western valleys. These people could have had access to the tropical forests of Salta and Jujuy by way of Tiquina in the center of the Titicaca lake. One of the most important features of this ideology seems to have been solar religion, in which metal plaques were probably sig nificant (Gonzalez, 1985). There may be a relationship between the Pukina language and the Pukara culture (Bouysse-Cassagne, 1988). In turn, these are related to Chiripa, and as components of the Yaya Mama tradition (sensu Mohr). According to Bouysse Cassagne, Coac, the serpent, became the god of the Pukinas, and modern Urus groups may be descendants of former Pukinas. The expansion of these "Pukin ized" Urus from the Titicaca Basin to the south and west might coincide with the Pre-Tiwanaku development, related to the circum-Titicaca region. This view has also been interpreted as the ethnic group known as Kolis by Rostworowski (1986), who, citing Bertonio, correlates ethnic groups from the Yungas living in Moquegua, southern Peru. In 1567, the Garci Diez de San Miguel visita refers to 400 Urus living in the Atacama (Diez de San Miguel, 1964). This information may be very significant with respect to the Pre-Tiwanaku devel opment. During the Spanish occupation, the Yungas groups could not claim access to land in the altiplano, probably because they were not part of the tra ditional reciprocal system. This might indicate an earlier expansion, and that Yungas had lost their rights as later expansions occurred. In this context, the legendary figure of Tunupa, also known as Tarapaca, is important (Rivera, 1985). If Tunupa was a Pukina deity, he would fit very well into the Yaya Mama religious tradition. Tiwanaku Influence This corresponds to the Middle Intermediate Period. Although there is a clear difference between the western valleys and the Atacama Desert in the degree of influence from the Titicaca center, the whole period represents real political integration under Tiwanaku. The western valleys, being closer to the circum-Titicaca zone, were more easily incorporated into the economic complementarity that developed through out Tiwanaku. This was reinforced by the presence of multiethnic colonies in the low valleys (Mujicaer aL, 1983; Rivera, 1976, 1985; Santoro, 1980, 1981). This direct pattern contrasts sharply with the Tiwanaku presence south of Tili viche: in the Atacama Desert, Tiwanaku influences were indirect and seem to have been more through religious practices, thus emphasizing the ideological</page><page sequence="29">Prehistory of Northern Chile 29 framework (Berenguer and Dauelsberg, 1989). Today, some argue that there were actual Tiwanaku colonies in the western valleys, interacting with local ethnic groups within the economic framework of the vertical archipelago (Murra, 1975). This would be an outcome of Alto Ramirez, during which complemen tary economies emerged. The beginning of Tiwanaku influence in the western valleys is detectable in the Cabuza phase (A.D. 300-700), although a somewhat earlier pure Tiwa naku colonization could have reached this area (Loreto Viejo; see below). Cabuza is a ceramic style with clear archaeological contexts, which includes black-on-red ware with geometric designs, the kero (beaker) shape, and various bowls and jars. Sobraya is a variation of Cabuza, with white out lines of black designs. Burial patterns changed from previous stages. Mounds were no longer used; instead, we find bundle burials of flexed bodies covered with woollen shirts; the braided hair was replaced by turbans, similar to depic tions from Tiwanaku (Arriaza et al., 1986). The head was usually covered with a woollen cap with four points, decorated in one or two colors with geometric designs in relief. Cabuza also saw a proliferation of textiles for various purposes (ceremonial, ritual, domestic) and advances in weaving techniques, such as the "floating warp" that produces polychrome designs. Also noteworthy is the pro duction of carved wood keros, boxes, trays, and, above all, spoons [which have an interesting typology (Espoueys, 1972-1973, types C)]. Leatherwork and basketry produced sandals, strings, quivers, and bags of several types. Coiled basketry was by far the most common technique and the shapes imitate those of ceramics. Metal work included plaques, ornaments, rings, and beads of gold and silver; bronze was used mostly for agricultural tools?digging sticks, knives, hoes, and shovels. Domestic crops consisted of maize, sweet potatoes, beans, quinoa, pumpkins, jiquima, squashes, and coca, grown by irrigation, particu larly along the valleys. Villages of this phase contained large numbers of stor age rooms and silos, which suggest intensive economic redistributive practices within the framework of complementarity between different ecozones. Biological studies suggest that Cabuza groups found it difficult to adjust to an environment so different from the altiplano. Infant mortality was high and a significant number of women died in childbirth (Arriaza et al., 1984). Aufder heide and others (1990) found an increase in pneumonia: for Chinchorro (the preceding tradition), there were 27 episodes among infants, all of them fatal, and 65 in adults, of which 10 were fatal; for Cabuza, there were 226 episodes for infants, with 113 fatal, and 100 for adults, 39 of them fatal. (The frequency is the number of episodes per year per 1000 individuals.) They concluded that this represents a problem of newcomers adjusting to a different environment. Within the Cabuza phase, Loreto Viejo contexts may represent an elite class of Tiwanaku rulers in the coastal polities (Mujica et al., 1983). Loreto Viejo polychrome ceramics are extremely fine, well finished, and highly styl</page><page sequence="30">30 Rivera ized and were probably pieces for ceremonial use, imported from the core area of Tiwanaku. Loreto Viejo contexts also yield important textiles, skirts with typical Tiwanaku motifs, polychrome four-cornered hats, baskets, and remark able hallucinogen-related trays, tubes, and spatulae. Burials in Middle Period cemeteries indicate some social segregation: the few Loreto Viejo bodies are always separated from the more numerous Cabuza type (as at Azapa-6 and Azapa-71). Cabuza thus represents a population of altiplano origin, influenced by Tiwanaku, while Loreto Viejo was the ruling Tiwanaku group in the low valleys. In the Atacama Desert, especially in the salt puna region and San Pedro de Atacama oasis, the Quitor phase is equivalent to Cabuza of the Azapa valley. Quitor (A.D. 400-700) had antecedents with Alto Ramirez development at sites such as Tulor and Tchapuchayna and makes up the San Pedro I period of the local sequence (Orellana, 1963). San Pedro I is also called the Sequitor phase by Berenguer and others (1986). San Pedro II is the Middle Period, when Tiwanaku influences were impor tant. An important feature is the black polished ware with various shapes such as bottles, dishes, bowls, and vessels; bottle necks are decorated with punctate human faces and bowls with incised stylized llamas. There is firm evidence of strong interaction with areas as far as Quebrada Tarapaca (Caserones), north western Argentina (Calahoyo, Hualfin, Calchaqui), and coastal sites in Anto fagasta and Taltal, where San Pedro II ceramics are common. These constitute additional evidence for caravans crossing the desert. During San Pedro II and particularly under Tiwanaku influence, iconographic designs of trophy heads, sacrificers, feline-humans, and other classic motifs are common on textiles, basketry, some ceramics, and hallucinogen-related wooden trays and tubes. Berenguer and Dauelsberg (1989) have noted that connections with northwest ern Argentina were stronger immediately before this period, and by A.D. 400 Argentinian influence was replaced completely by Tiwanaku in the area of San Pedro de Atacama. Tiwanaku influence reached its peak in San Pedro de Atacama between A.D. 600 and A.D. 1000, when we find full craft specialization and a differ entiation of social and political roles. Archaeological finds, including golden keros, fine textiles, and excellent pottery, all with the distinctive Tiwanaku iconography, reveal the existence of status differences among the San Pedro II population. Thus, they were an already complex society with varied economic activities (agriculture, exchange, complementarity, animal husbandry), social groupings, and political and religious leaders. Berenguer and Dauelsberg (1989), based on Torres (1984) and Thomas and others (1984), suggest that the use of trays for hallucinogenic purposes was restricted to an elite within the commu nity; Llagostera and others (1988) reached similar conclusions. Torres's study of the iconography involved revealed 16 main themes, which thus might rep</page><page sequence="31">Prehistory of Northern Chile 31 resent the principal lineages of the San Pedro people. The elite may have le gitimized their position by linking themselves to mythical characters through the use of narcotics; this was probably also an important factor during Pre Tiwanaku times in the western valleys (Rivera, 1985). Further developments of Tiwanaku influence in northern Chile can be seen in the Maytas phase (A.D. 700-1000) in the western valleys and Coyo in the San Pedro de Atacama region. Both phases represent the last development within the Middle Period. The Coyo phase saw the most important Tiwanaku influence in the oases area (Berenguer and Dauelsberg, 1989; Thomas et al., 1985). This influence concerned mainly the elite: undisputed Tiwanaku objects (golden keros, textiles, basketry, ceramic vessels, wooden objects) occur in elite buri als, suggesting that this area was incorporated into the Tiwanaku empire at least in ritual and ideology. Key sites for this development are Coyo, Solor-3, Qui tor-5, and Quitor-6. There was an emphasis on iconographic motifs identical to those on the Gate of the Sun in Tiwanaku itself, but it is difficult to tell whether Tiwanaku-influenced people in San Pedro de Atacama represent an actual migration of groups from the Titicaca area (Nunez, 1963; Tarrago, 1984) or an ideological penetration (Berenguer and Dauelsberg, 1989). There is a similar situation in the core area of the Atacama Desert, centered around Calama-Chiu Chiu in the middle course of the Loa river. Here, in the contemporary Lasana II phase, local pottery styles appear to be associated with some aspects of Tiwa naku iconography, as at Laguna Este-1 [960 B.P. ? 80 years (1-12401) (Rivera and Marinov, 1983)]. The principal interests of this region for Tiwanaku people were copper minerals and lapis lazuli. At this time there was also a close relation between San Pedro II and the Aguada culture of northwestern Argentina. Aguada is an important part of the Argentinian Middle Period, but we do not yet understand the strong Tiwanaku influence there. This might ultimately explain the appear ance of Tiwanaku in the San Pedro area (Fig. 10). In the western valleys farther north, Tiwanaku influences are reflected in the so-called Expansive Tiwanaku. The archaeological record shows continuity from Cabuza into later developments such as Maytas and Chiribaya, which also have Tiwanaku influence. We can assume then that Tiwanaku continued its economic policies of complementarity with the low valleys on the Pacific coast. Ceramics of these styles are local developments with few Tiwanaku attributes (mainly shapes like keros), but textiles and other materials do suggest a more direct relation to Tiwanaku. Radiocarbon dates for the Maytas phase fall between 1250 and 850 B.P. This phase can be seen as a regional development of earlier Tiwanaku influ ences, which accords with my hypothesis that, from very early on, the western valleys were included within the Titicaca-based polity, both economically and ideologically. Maytas ceramics are characterized by black and white designs on</page><page sequence="32">Rivera Fig. 10.

Vessel forms are usually jars with globular bodies, straight bases, vertical handles, and straight necks; also important are keros, bowls, and double bottles; a button applied on the upper part of the handle is typical of Maytas (Fig. 11). Chiribaya is basically the same style with the addition of lines of white dots along the black designs and more concentric motifs, sometimes divided into four, six, or eight radial sections (Fig. 12). The most important site of this phase is San Lorenzo, an extended village on a hilltop some 12 km inland in the middle Azapa valley.</page><page sequence="33">Prehistory of Northern Chile 33 ^^^^^^ Fig. 11.

(Museo Universidad de Tarapaca)</page><page sequence="34">34 Rivera Tiwanaku, and particularly its ideology, expanded over much of northern Chile, especially the western valleys, which were in direct contact with the core area in the Titicaca basin (Rivera, 1985). Berenguer and Dauelsberg (1989) see the Tiwanaku expansion as a planned, three-step process: the creation of a semiperiphery in the circum-Titicaca region; the incorporation of the periphery, particularly the western valleys; and finally, use of the ultraperiphery, in the Atacama Desert and puna region, where Tiwanaku sought prestige goods. THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT The Late Intermediate Period falls after the Tiwanaku influence and before the spread of the Inca empire and was a period when regional cultures emerged. However, the earlier Tiwanaku influence had been so strong that the later devel opments cannot be considered completely local in character; they contain many Tiwanaku traits. Continuity was strongest in ideology, which maintained eco nomic ties with the altiplano. This was important for the western valleys, whereas the salt puna and desert regions broke with the circum-Titicaca polities during the final Tiwanaku phase. The Late Intermediate Period was thus more locally developed in the desert region than the western valleys, where new eth nic groups continued to arrive from the altiplano and settle down. With the end of the Tiwanaku state, there were great upheavals of popu lation. Groups identified with black-on-red ceramics usually occupied the upper valleys, precordillera and altiplano. In the low valleys and coastal environ ments, "polychrome pottery" groups seem to be predominant. This continuous movement of people from the Lake Titicaca region to southern Peru, northern Chile, and northwestern Argentina explains why many local settlements defended themselves by building pukaras (or fortifications; this term is in no way related to the Pukara culture noted above but, rather, is a general term for a fortified site of the late period). "Black-on-red" settlements were located at strategic points, controlling access to productive land. Their economic organi zation is seen as complementarity and redistribution through full development of the vertical archipelago system, especially in the western valleys. Goods from different ecozones, including the tropical forest, the highlands, and the Pacific coast, are found in the pukaras. This mobility is characteristic of the Late Intermediate Period. It is reflected archaeologically in a mosaic of interdigitating cultural phases, which were self sufficient within the framework of complementarity. Labor specialization was probably very intense and ceramics and textiles became highly distinctive and stylized. Settlements of this period cover areas of 0.5-7.0 ha, especially in the west ern valleys (e.g., in the Azapa valley, Azapa-28, and Cerro Sombrero with an area of 7 ha). Dwellings contain areas for storage (silos) and corrals. Many</page><page sequence="35">Prehistory of Northern Chile 35 sites have defensive walls at strategic points. Some sites, such as Saxamar, Copaquilla, San Lorenzo, Purisa, Tangani, and Huahuarani, had large popu lations; the last site has over 1000 houses. Some agricultural fields were extensive and open, while terracing was common elsewhere, depending on topography. In either case, fields were irri gated by extensive networks of canals. Some sites, especially in the highlands, also have chullpas, tall structures of adobe or stone, usually for mortuary pur poses. In the lowlands was the Arica complex, consisting of the successive San Miguel and Gentilar phases [equivalent to Bird's Arica I and II (Bird, 1943)]. The beginning of San Miguel is estimated at A.D. 1000 and that of Gentilar at A.D. 1350. San Miguel ceramics include big globular water jars, with straight base, vertical handles, and narrow necks, keros or vessels with modeled figures on the rim, and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic vases. Decoration consists of geometric motifs in black or in red and black on a white slipped surface. Gen tilar is a better-quality and thinner pottery. Water jars with flaring necks are the most common. Designs are in black, white, and red on a smooth, red slip. The motifs are extremely varied but mostly geometric figures (Fig. 13); there are also crosses and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs (Dauelsberg, 1972; Uhle, 1919; Bird, 1943; Schaedel and Munizaga, 1957). Pocoma is a transitional style of pottery with designs distributed in panels on a light red color background and separated by vertical lines. Fig. 13. Gentilar ceramics from Azapa. (Museo Universidad de Tarapaca)</page><page sequence="36">36 Rivera The distribution of these styles centers around the western valleys of north ern Chile and also includes the valleys of southern Peru, particularly Caplina, Sama, and Osmore. They are occasionally found south of Pisagua, especially at coastal sites such as Caleta Huelen and Taltal. This southern distribution reflects partly coastal navigation on the three-log rafts often found in Late Inter mediate Period burials. Toward the altiplano, the distribution reaches the head water valleys in the precordillera and the Titicaca region, where Hyslop (1976) found such ceramics in Lupaqa settlements. Nevertheless, the predominant ceramic style in the altiplano and precor dillera is black on red. There seem to be complementary distributions from the highlands to the coast, with polychrome styles better represented in the lowland and black on red predominant in the highlands. This is supported by the study by Niemeyer and others (1972-1973) of sites throughout the valley of Cama rones. At sites such as Pukara de Camarones Sur and Huancarane-1, poly chrome Arica pottery represents 65-85% of the total, while upstream, at Chibaljaya and Sabaipugro, black on red reaches 70-90%. This predominance of black on red ware is also seen at altiplano sites, such as Laco Alto, Saxamar, Tangani, and Huahuarani. In the Azapa region, black-on-red ware is equated with the Chilpe style and was contemporaneous with Gentilar style on the coast. Chilpe is a post Tiwanaku style, known in the altiplano as the Colla style and related to the Colla expansion (Schaedel and Munizaga, 1957). According to Dauelsberg (1982), Colla expansion into the Azapa valley by A.D. 1300 began the "Aymarization" of the western valleys. The style is associated with circular houses, slab-type funerary chambers, and chullpas, traits all considered alti planic. The pottery includes various shapes, bowls being the most common. Designs are usually black painted and consist of concentric circles, crosses, and wavy parallel lines on the rim. The chullpas, built of adobe or stone, are usually rectangular with a small opening providing access to the chamber; they are always oriented toward the east and usually covered with white plaster, some times decorated with red lines. They were probably not used by common peo ple, but only by the elite; this may be a diagnostic feature of altiplano colonies. Zapahuira, Caillama, and Chilpe itself have the best chullpas. The vertical economy model that supported altiplano groups in the low valleys involved agricultural products such as maize, aji, beans, pumpkins, and coca; coastal goods such as guano, fish, and salt; and, from the upper valleys and precordil lera, potatoes, oca {Oxalis tuberosa), ulluco (Ollucum tuberosum), quinoa and canahua (Chenopodium palli dicaule), and coca (Rivera, 1976; Schiappacasse etaL, 1989). South of the western valleys, Late Intermediate sites are well known in Quebrada Tarapaca and the oases of the Atacama Desert (e.g., Pica, Toconce, and San Pedro Atacama). In Quebrada Tarapaca, villages occur at altitudes of</page><page sequence="37">Prehistory of Northern Chile 37 1000-2000 m, based upon agriculture in the valley. The villages are rather small, averaging about 0.5 ha, but reveal urban features such as streets and a planned organization with sectors devoted to different activities (elite residential units, grinding areas, corrals). They are associated with irrigated agricultural terraces. Important sites of this type are Tarapaca 13 (in the locality of Huara sina), Tarapaca 15 (in Tilivilca), Tarapaca 44 (in Arias), and Tarapaca 49 (Tar apaca Viejo) (Nunez, 1982; Schiappacasse et al., 1989). Upstream in Quebrada Tarapaca, on the altiplano at Pukar-Qollu, in Isluga, and Usamaya, there are chullpas associated with black-on-red ware (Sanhueza and Olmos, 1982; San hueza, 1981). In the desert and puna, the Late Intermediate Period is best known from defensive sites located 2500-3000 m asl. These sites, known as pukaras, have clusters of houses, with restricted internal circulation and storage facilities on the periphery; there are agricultural fields nearby. Typical ceramics include San Pedro Almost Polished Black ware, Dupont Black ware, and Red Painted ware. Outside influences come from northwestern Argentina. The archaeological record suggests that during this time there were large concentrations of people exploiting extensive agricultural fields. They also practiced intensive strategies based on raising and taming large number of lla mas and alpacas that provided the basis for interregional movement. Caravans crossed the desert using signs called geoglyphs that indicated the route (Nunez, 1976b). The defensive settlements, funerary contexts, and rock art also indicate considerable intergroup tension. At San Pedro de Atacama, this period is the San Pedro III phase (A.D. 1000-1450); the most representative sites are Pukara Quitor and Solor. Sites elsewhere in the desert include Lasana (Lasana II phase) in the middle course of the Rio Loa (Pollard, 1971); Pukara Turi, in the upper Rio Salado (a tributary of the Loa); and Lasana, near Chiu Chiu (Fig. 14). These all have red painted ware. The sites are clustered villages, built in strategic spots with defensive walls, with rectangular houses of stone and mortar rather than adobe, and hous ing estimated populations of 400-500. Agricultural fields are associated, some times terraced, but usually extended and irrigated. In the salt puna above 3000 m, Aldunate and Castro (1981) have defined the Toconce Mallku complex, with over 20 sites known in the area of Toconce. The complex is related to the Lipez region of southern Bolivia, and its most distinctive feature is settlements with three distinct areas: the houses, the chull pas, and the storage section. The chullpas are located at the highest points, above the houses. The houses are rectangular, 20-200 in a village, in a clustered pattern with contiguous stone walls. Most of the ceramics are large, under rated, globular jars, known as Likan ordinary type; there is also Likan Red type (mostly bowls) and Hedionda Black-on-Buff, with geometric designs painted on the inside rim (again, mostly bowls) (Schiappacasse et al., 1989).</page><page sequence="38">38 Rivera Fig. 14. Pukara Lasana, Atacama Desert near Chiu Chiu. As in the western valleys and dry puna, the altiplano influences show inter esting similarities to late developments in the Bolivian and Argentinian puna. Inca Influence The Late Period in northern Chile is equated with the influence and spread of the Inca empire. This has never been considered a critical area for the Inca expansion, nor has there been a thorough study of the Inca occupation here, which is partly why it has been regarded as a marginal area of the empire. However, the area relates to broad problems, such as the accessibility and via bility of the extreme southern regions, maintenance of roads, and transporta tion, all of which are related to Inca administration. The region is therefore of importance for the overall structure of the empire. Inca installations varied according to particular characteristics of each zone. The western valleys were directly incorporated into the centralized state system. Economic complementarity, based on the sociopolitical organization, continued as before. The region continued to exchange fruits, coca, guano, salt, maize, and aji from the coast and low valleys, potatoes from the precordillera, and llama and alpaca by-products from the altiplano. South of the western valleys, the Atacama Desert and oases were occupied</page><page sequence="39">Prehistory of Northern Chile 39 by force. The oases in the Atacama Desert were important posts for the Inca highway and, in some cases, such as Caspana and Turi in the Salado-Loa drain age and Catarpe in San Pedro de Atacama, they were important in controlling the valleys' access to water, for both strategic and irrigation purposes. Catarpe and Peine were well-defended Inca posts, with protected roads leading into them; they had high population densities, with buildings clustered around cen tral courtyards, and are located in strategic positions relative to the valleys and the cultivable land. From San Pedro de Atacama to Copiapo (still within the desert), Inca expansion was less intensive. The last true Inca post is near Copiapo, and from there southward, "conquest" was probably indirect. In the late Intermediate Period, economic complementarity was achieved by archipelagos. Ethnohis toric sources mention colonies belonging to some altiplano ethnic groups, such as Lupaqas, Pacajes, and Carangas. The presence of the Inca state thus resulted in a level of socioeconomic organization which involved meaningful political structure in the valleys of Lluta, Azapa, and Camarones. Tambos (way-stations) and pukaras in Chun gara, Belen, Zapahuira, and Purisa, or villages such as Alto Ramirez (Azapa 15) demonstrate that they were all in contact and were parts of a network com ing from the altiplano. Production and exchange of goods were vital in this scheme and included coastal sites such as Play a Miller and Camarones. As economic relations were reinforced, so also was the ideological-political frame work. Ceramics from Lake Titicaca occur in the western valleys (where they are known as Saxamar or Inca-Pacajes) (Dauelsberg, 1959; Munizaga, 1957; Ryden, 1947). Farther south, the main feature of Inca domination was mining (turquoise and copper), for which maintenance of the highway was crucial, and the local population had to be controlled by force in order to extend the empire. Direct domination is represented by the local Inca development exemplified by Catarpe and Peine and, to some extent, Turi and Cerro Verde. The local population of San Pedro de Atacama and neighboring oases did not participate in the same ideological system as the Incas, and complementarity and other economic and political structural relations with the altiplano were not fully developed, but were kept at a secondary level and never centralized. The desert mines were important to the empire and traffic in minerals was centered around Catarpe (Silva, 1985), with administrative officials in charge of its production. In and around Copiapo, in the valley of Chanar, the Inca controlled local tribute of gold and turquoise (Bibar, 1558). It is noteworthy that the Inca introduced new mining techniques, particularly foundries and amalgamation procedures, which differ from the simpler Late Period extractive techniques in this area. El Sal vador and Vina del Cerro were important mining centers. Monumental architecture is usually lacking at Inca sites, although several</page><page sequence="40">40 Rivera Table V.

Inca features in the area may be classified into five types: pukaras and complex settlements, tambos, highway features, mines, and sanctuaries. Table V is a simplified list of these site types; additional details are given in the references. All along the south, there are sanctuaries on top of the main Andean moun tains (Pili, Lincancabur, Salin) and, exceptionally, on the coastal cordillera (Cerro Esmeralda, Iquique). They involved a wealth of symbolism, which pro vided a catalyst for conquest south of the Atacama Desert. According to Rein hard (1983), the sanctuary at Socaire was probably related to obtaining water for agriculture, which was also an Inca practice. This emphasis on sanctuaries and mountains seems to come from the earlier Illapa-Tunupa myths and is related to fertility beliefs (Rivera, 1985). The sanctuaries also involved a specific orga nization that included specialists capable of building platforms in high-altitude conditions and the provision of access roads. These were operated by a central hierarchy, which used ideology as a network to bind all the southern Inca ter ritories; that is, the sanctuaries replaced the monumental architecture that is characteristic of Inca settlements elsewhere. As we know from ethnohistorical sources, the Inca domination ended with the arrival of the Europeans in the sixteenth century. Since then, Andean history has been written differently. But that is a matter beyond the scope of this paper. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This synthesis involves a work done over a long period of time, made possible by several people and institutions.
