<plain_text><page sequence="1">INFLUENCE OF EUROPEAN CULTURE ON AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES1 By Ronald M. Berndt •^THE object of these comments is to counteract, to some extent at least, the * depressing conclusions which Dr. Lommel has drawn. The author's contention is that the influence of modern (European) culture on the life of the Australian Aborigines has been mainly a psychological phenomenon (p. 14). Everywhere, he claims, the result of the slightest contact seems to be a falling birth rate, and a disintegrating social organization (p. 15) : to the Aborigines the physical act of generation was virtually insignificant, the accent being on a psychic condition (crystallized in a dream) ; and since these dreams now occur less frequently, being clouded by visions relating to Europeans and their contact (the natives' psychic sensibility being upset), the birthrate falls (pp. 16-17). When the psychic balance of the Aborigines is disturbed, the abilities of the medicine-man seem to decline, and he is unable to operate (p. 19). Moreover, we are told, the Aborigines do not differentiate between an experience during a dream and an experience in real life (p. 19). Dr. Lommel concludes by outlining a cult which he calls " kurrangara," described as being concerned with European contact, but having a mythology, and a traditional basis (pp. 21-24). It involves a " new " view of time, which now brings in the future ; but this future is felt to be " extremely dark," a deep melancholy and apathy being salient characteristics of the present attitude. This is " darkened still more by additional mythological features linked with the cult " (p. 24) - for example, women may take the place of men ! An eschatological attitude is the outcome. Dr. Lommel's research took place in 1938 in north-western Australia. My own field work was in the eastern Kimberleys and in adjacent regions in the Northern Territory (including Wave Hill, Limbunya, Waterloo, Tanami and the Granites) in 1944-45, and therefore I do not possess first-hand knowledge of Dr. LommeTs area. Certain cultural elements however are common throughout the region, and I have got intimate knowledge of the " kurrangara," which has a wide distribution. Further, it is doubtful whether Dr. Lommel was sound in generalizing from Ungarinyin, Worora and Unambal (p. 14) material only. Culture contact conditions vary so considerably throughout Australia that one should generalize only most broadly, and only in regard to features more or less fully documented anthrop- ologically. His assumptions, moreover, do not appear to be tenable for the greater part of Aboriginal Australia. Alien contact with Australian Aborigines does not necessarily lead to psychic apathy and depression, with belief in the imminent " end of the world." And depopulation is not always the outcome, although this has taken place in many regions. While acknowledging that psychological changes may be distinguished before any change in the material culture has taken place, I consider that the influence of European culture on the life of the Aborigines is not primarily a psychological phenomenon. The impact of alien contact can be simultaneously psychic and material, the two being inseparably interrelated. Dr. Lommel tells us that in the 1 A critique of Dr. A. Lommel's article in Oceania, Vol. XXI, No. 1, pp. 14-24. r</page><page sequence="2">230 EUROPEAN CULTURE AND THE ABORIGINES Kimberley Division there were broadly three groups who lived in every imaginable state between undisturbed indigenous culture and complete absorption (pp. 14-15). The few belonging to the first group avoided contact with modern culture and preserved a " Stone Age " way of living ; Dr. Lommel " conversed with them with the help of interpreters," an inadequate approach. It is possible that these people in 1938 had been influenced more than he suspected by European culture, which had then (p. 15) " made itself strongly felt " ; alien goods and ideas would come through Aboriginal channels, from more fully acculturated members of other groups. Alien contact does not inevitably result in depopulation, despite the fact that in many cases it is followed by cultural and social disintegration. Dr. Lommel should have prepared depopulation and vital statistics for the three groups which he discusses. In central-western Northern Territory and in the eastern Kimberleys, the present writer and his wife came to realize the psychological effects of mal- nutrition in lessening the desire to produce children, so that abortion was widely practised.2 This is an important aspect of depopulation; but the psychological factors involved there stemmed directly from physical conditions imposed on the Aborigines by the dominant alien group. These upset radically not only the natives' material welfare, but also their " psychic balance " (that is, the emotional bond existing between themselves, their environment and their culture), leading to a form of psychical apathy or depression. The latter, however, could be remedied in some degree by sympathetic and understanding welfare work backed by good administra- tion. The point is that depopulation may result indirectly from psychical apathy, of a kind differing somewhat from that noted by Dr. Lommel. This apathy may be caused in a variety of ways ; and, ignoring in this context apathy and depression arising from purely indigenous factors, all certainly spring from direct or indirect alien contact. Alien contact in Aboriginal Australia, however, has not led inevitably to a falling birthrate and cultural disintegration - for example, along the Arnhem Land coast from Caledon Bay to Cape Stewart,3 at Bathurst and Melville Islands, and Port Keats. Moreover, a falling birthrate is not necessarily synonymous with tribal or cultural disintegration. Dr. Lommel says that " in spite of favourable economic and hygienic conditions in the Kunmunja Mission, the decline of the birthrate was evident even there " (p. 15). Economic and hygienic conditions, although they have a considerable bearing on the question of depopulation, represent only one aspect of an extremely complex problem. Dr. Lommel's discussion suffers from over-simplification of matters relating to the culture contact situation, from insufficiently supported generalizations, and from lack of comparison with relevant situations in other parts of Aboriginal Australia. The same may be said of the statement that " whenever a closer contact takes place, a falling birthrate may usually be ascribed to introduced diseases or declining economic conditions " (p. 16). This is not always the case. Nor is news of modern culture alone sufficient to destroy the Aborigines' concept of the universe (p. 16) ; the account of the " kurrangara " should prove the contrary. Mere contact with an alien culture need not inevitably have a profoundly disturbing effect on these " primitives " to such an extent that their entire way of living, and indeed life itself, is revolutionized. Nevertheless, it does affect the Aborigines, both psychologically 2 Vide R. and C. Berndt, Native Labour and Welfare in the Northern Territory, Sydney, 1946 (duplicated typescript), pp. 68-71, 153-165. 3 R. and C. Berndt, Arnhem Land, Its History and Its People (F. W. Cheshire Pty. Ltd., for publication).</page><page sequence="3">EUROPEAN CULTURE AND THE ABORIGINES 231 and materially in varying degrees. It alters, modifies, accentuates or eradicates, as the case may be, certain aspects of traditional and indigenous life and culture. Sometimes this results in disintegration, tribal apathy, depopulation and finally extinction ; but just as often it merely alters the stream of native life, changes internal institutions, and re-orientates ideology, leading to some measure of physical and psychical readjustment to changing conditions. It does not always destroy the Aborigines' concept of the universe, although, indeed, traditional motivation may be changed. In extreme cases, of course, their biological existence may be and has been affected ; but this is by no means inevitable. As Dr. Lommel says (p. 17), the Aborigines' reproductive abilities depend not only on their physical wellbeing but also on their psychic balance ; one need not, however, formulate the same conclusions. Dr. Lommel tells us (p. 16) that at Kunmunja " the aborigines regarded a special psychic disposition, which they called a dream, as the cause of pregnancy . . . There, in the mission, the problem of ignorance of physical paternity did not exist. The physical facts had been brought to their knowledge by discussions with white persons ... To them the physical act of generation was more or less insignificant ; the accent was on a psychic condition - a dream - which they regarded as being of biological importance concerning their procreative disposition*/ ' The assumption here is that before the advent of the alien the Aborigines were ignorant of physical paternity. We are not told how this is to be correlated with the description on page 19 of " two snakes . . . copulating and incessantly engendering spirit children/' The physical act of generation seems to have been significant in so far as the produc- tion of spirit children were concerned, so why not of the material part of a child ? This " conception " dream is indispensable, but to the Aborigines the physical act is equally so. In the eastern Kimberleys, as in many other regions, the Aborigines believe that one or many acts of coitus result in the formation of an embryo, while the dream provides the soul or spirit (for example, page 17, " . . . From that snake originates an anthropomorphic called Wondjina, representing rain and fertility. In the depth of wells, which resist the heat of the summer, these two beings are incessantly creating so-called spirit children, souls of children to be born"). The physical act of generation in many parts of Aboriginal Australia is of great significance, manifesting itself not only in everyday life, but also in love magic and sweetheart songs, and in religious ritual and mythology. Physical love, physical increase of human beings and of the natural species, supply a theme which at times assumes dominating importance. Pregnancy is brought about by the sexual act, the foetus being formed by elements from both the mother and the father ; but for this physical material to " become alive," to be animated, to receive the " breath of life," the soul or spirit must enter it. This soul originates in much the same way as that described by Dr. Lommel and is manifested through the medium of the dream. This blending of the physical with the psychical would possibly be found also at Kunmunja. The anthropologist may well feel the spiritual side of conception and pregnancy to be paramount in the minds of the Aborigines (and Dr. Lommel is not alone in this). But closer enquiry, along with an intimate knowledge of the language, of religion and love magic, may perhaps dispel the idea that the Aborigine regards the physical act of generation as insignificant. My wife and I have worked in regions subjected to a great deal of alien contact in various forms ; and although the Aborigines' material culture has been affected, their dreaming of " Spirit Landings " (in which appears the soul of the child to be born) has not suffered. In one area, however, where malnutrition and ill-treatment had led to serious depopulation, the reasons given for the non-dreaming of " Spirit FF</page><page sequence="4">232 EUROPEAN CULTURE AND THE ABORIGINES Landings " were that as few women became pregnant, few embryos were formed, and consequently few dreams could occur. At Goulburn Islands and Oenpelli,4 too, there was said to be a large surplus of spirit children awaiting embryos to animate. " Where are our mothers ? " they are said to ask, " Where our bodies ? " Depopulation in that region was caused directly through alien contact, and the introduction of venereal diseases was a contributing factor. Several men complained : " I work and work my wives night and day, making myself tired out, and still no babies come. And there are all the spirit children waiting ! " There, too, virtual promiscuity is the accepted pattern, men and women having intercourse with a wide range of partners ; but abortion and contraceptive measures are not practised to any significant extent. Detailed study of dreams at Yirrkalla, in north-eastern Arnhem Land, revealed that although the Aborigines could become profoundly disturbed by contact with alien culture, their psychic disturbance did not in any way interfere with traditional forms of dreaming relating to magic, to ritual and religious dogma, or to " Spirit Landings " associated with conception and pregnancy. Let us consider Dr. LommeFs paragraph on p. 17 : " The disturbance caused by approaching modern culture - by direct contact or even by rumours - may be sufficient to upset their emotional balance in such a degree that the psychic disposition necessary for the physical act of generation will not be attained any more." In context, this appears to mean that because the Aborigines are disturbed emotionally by alien contact they cannot have full sexual intercourse, or if they do the spermatozoa will be infertile. One may query the validity of this assumption. Male or female sterility appears to be brought about through purely physical forms of disastrous alien contact, disease, malnutrition, and so on. These physical factors can and do disturb the Aborigines' emotional and psychic life, for lowered bodily health diminishes the desire for intercourse. Malnutrition and venereal diseases, of course, lead eventually to sterility. Aborigines who have had intensive alien contact but who are economically secure and well fed, are emotionally satisfied to some extent, and are free from disease, do not lose their inclination and ability to indulge in intercourse, or to impregnate and be impregnated. Lack of faith in life, caused by the collapse of indigenous forms of social control and religion, may bring about disillusionment and emotional upset, but there is no proof that this impairs either their desire for sexual intercourse or their fertility. For example, when traditional rules of behaviour are broken down, and alien contact has not succeeded in replacing them or in re-establish- ing the Aborigines' emotional security, sexual licence may become general ; this has happened in many parts of the Northern Territory, such as at Oenpelli, Goulburn Islands, Darwin and Katherine, where women and men have more extramarital intercourse and where more children than formerly are born outside the marriage bond. Depopulation has its origin in the disturbance of the physical status quo, and this gives rise to psychic upset and emotional instability. Psychic disturbances, however, do not necessarily lead to the termination of all forms of traditional behaviour and thought (although they may eventually curtail them), nor do they inevitably terminate the activities of native doctors or " medicine men." Everything depends on the extent and intensity of alien contact, on the degree of responsiveness within a society to alien concepts and practices, and on the 4 Vide R. and C. Berndt, Sexual Behaviour in Western Arnhem Land, Viking Fund Publica- tions in Anthropology, N.Y. (In the press.)</page><page sequence="5">EUROPEAN CULTURE AND THE ABORIGINES 233 policy and practice of the local Administration. Traditional culture may change : various elements may be modified or intensified, new ideas and institutions may be adopted and adapted, or superimposed on the old, as the case may be. Intensive alien contact may take place, and the social unit survive without inevitable depopulation. On page 19, Dr. Lommel tells us that " For the Aborigines there is no difference between an experience during a dream and an experience in real life. Both spheres have the same reality, and they are unable to separate them/' This is not true for the Australian Aborigines among whom the writer has worked, who make a definite distinction between dream and waking life. Both spheres are " real " in their own right, but each has a different kind of reality. The two overlap only in relation to sorcery, to the initiation and experiences of native doctors. Knowledge of the local native languages, together with the collection of texts relating to everyday life, to mythology and to dream life, should clarify this point. We have now come to the focal point of Dr. Lommel's paper, the " new " cult called the " kurrangara " (pp. 21-24), in connection with which he draws the depress- ing assumptions found on page 24. I do not think that one can legitimately call this a " new " cult, even though it has only recently spread into the Kimberleys of north-western Australia. Having a traditional background and mythology of its own, through the contact of various Aboriginal groups with one another it has gradually been spreading until it is now fairly widely diffused. While " new/1 perhaps, to the people who see it for the first time, it is " old " in its region of origin. It may indeed be compared to a psychic wave which revitalizes the postulants (p. 21), and its blending of alien European ideas with traditional forms demonstrates its high degree of flexibility and assimilatory powers. The " kurrangara " described by Dr. Lommel has apparently changed its original function and meaning on arrival in the upper Kimberleys. In the eastern Kimberleys, north-central Northern Territory and the Tanami-Granites region, the " kurrangara " (gu 'ray ara or gray ara) is part of the great religious Kalwadi-Kadjari- Kunapipi Cult which has spread widely throughout the upper northern half of the Northern Territory.5 The gu' rayara is also known as the wilbibi, and is sacred, concerning itself with various interrelated totemic myths particularly associated with the great Ancestral Being named Sanba or Djanba (the Tjanba of Lommel, p. 23) ; he in turn is linked with the Fertility Mothers, Kalwadi or Kadjari, and the exotic Murjamurja women (daughters or reflections of their Mothers, Kadjari). It is rich in mythology and ritual ; and in the many song cycles (as yet unpublished) collected by the reviewer, purely indigenous and traditional subjects are treated. It is thus most interesting that contact features should appear in the examples quoted by Dr. Lommel. The gu' rayara I know intimately, however, is very different in content to that described by Dr. Lommel, although it is quite obvious that the " kurrangara " is related to the original. A comparison between it and the more southerly gu'rayara, in matters of ritual, mythology and interlinear songs, would be of great value. The gu'rayara does not absolutely exclude women (as apparently in Dr. Lommel's case). Women too have their part to play, and although they do not as a rule see the rituals, they can " hear " the singing, and they may perform their relevant ritual either alone (away from the men) or in the main camp. 5 R. Berndt, Kunapipi, F. W. Cheshire Pty. Ltd., Melbourne, 195 1 (in press). With reference to the gu' vangava also see E. Worms, " Die Goranara-Feier in Australischen " Kimberley," Annali Latevanensi, Vol. VI, 1942, pp. 208-235 ; and Helmut Petri, " Kuràngara. Neue magische Kulte in Nordwest-Australien," Zeitschvift fuv Etimologie, Band 75, 1950, pp. 43-51,</page><page sequence="6">234 EUROPEAN CULTURE AND THE ABORIGINES It is not easy to understand Dr. Lommers reference to time on p. 24, where he states that " . . . time has also changed its aspect in the new myth of the kurrangara cult. Hitherto there was no concept of a future. There was only an eternal dreamtime uniting the beginning of the world and the present. The past was more important than the present, the latter being only a reflection of the former. Now the past is fading away and the present derives its importance from a future with a menacing end of the world." Dr. Lommel does not apparently understand the full import of the concept of the " eternal dream time/'6 There has always been a concept of the future, for the " eternal dream time " means that an eternal stream runs on unendingly from the beginnings of time, and in it the past, present and future are as one. The concept is thus concerned not so much with time as we view it, as with traditional immutability : what has been, is, and will always be. It is not a phantasmagoric concept relating to a dream in the ordinary sense of the term. The past could not, from this point of view, be more important than the present or the future, for according to the Aborigines' concept there are no such arbitrary divisions. The past, the present and the future are clearly defined when necessary in everyday life, but not where the " eternal dream time " is concerned. It is a concept representing a special view of life, but that does not mean that the Aborigines are always caught up in these mystical ideas, and live in a haze where no time at all is distinguished ; the two may function concurrently. Perhaps the Aborigines are to-day " far more conscious of their actual living conditions " (p. 24), but this is not necessarily because of any alteration in the concept of time. Before European contact the relatively smooth running of indigenous forms of organization and food collecting produced a certain satisfaction with local living conditions - this, in effect, was the way to live, with control (physically and magically or, indeed, religiously) over one's immediate environment. To-day the status quo is altered through alien contact ; indigenous supplies of foods are perhaps no longer so readily available, and living conditions have altered ; outside agencies beyond the supplication and control of the Aborigines now provide food, living quarters and employment, and alien goods have been introduced. Obviously the Aborigines are now becoming more deeply aware of their actual living conditions ; and if these are adverse or mediocre their awareness is accentuated, and their " psychological unbalance " further intensified. Dr. Lommel comments (p. 24) : " The future is felt to be extremely dark, and a deep melancholy and apathy are salient characteristics of the present attitude." " This attitude finds its artistic expression in the ' kurrungara ' myth and dances ..." It appears to this reviewer that the Aborigines of Dr. Lommel' s region are making an endeavour to assimilate, to incorporate alien elements into traditional forms, to find explanations for strange phenomena, and to create a living and vital faith, in their own particular way. They are still interested in the world around them - in the world of the Aborigines and in the world of the European. They are endeavouring to blend the elements they know from both quarters and endeavouring in this way to establish a faith in which the future will be clearly related to the past, or in other words to remain in the continuum of the " eternal dream time." The reference to women's taking the place of men (p. 24) in matters pertaining to ritual needs much more analysis, and the reviewer suggests that Dr. Lommel has incorrectly assumed that the natives regard this with serious appre- hension. There is no reason why they should feel serious misgivings on this score, 8 Vide A. P. Elkin, The Australian Aborigines, Sydney, 1938.</page><page sequence="7">EUROPEAN CULTURE AND THE ABORIGINES 235 for the source of ritual power and sacredness may be found in woman.7 In any case, the admission of women into cult activities could serve to reinforce its influence ; in the traditional gu'rarjara women have already their defined part to play. The " fear " that women may gain complete executive control of such ritual, and that " the social order will be completely reversed " is something that lies within the control of the men ; and the fact that they consider it as a serious possibility demonstrates, perhaps, the important position women already hold in relation to the cult. The eschatological myth is present in many Aboriginal cultures, but in most cases it expresses deep psychological attitudes which are traditionally founded. It is something that is not normally, in Aboriginal Australia, at a conscious level, and in the reviewer's experience has never been expressed by the Aborigines as individuals or as a group. They may become emotionally upset owing to their physical circumstances, and see their culture toppling around them ; but as far as we know they cannot really envisage complete destruction, the cessation of the " eternal dream time " stream, and the life they know, even if under the most intensive and disastrous form of contact. The eschatological concept, if present, is at a subconscious or unconscious level ; and if physical and material life be curtailed, the spiritual essence survives. Even if the culture should disappear and all members of the society become extinct, there is the feeling that the " eternal stream " - in which all beings merge, in which the great Creative Gods and Goddesses are part - must, by its very nature, continue. As long as this concept retains its hold there can be no end of the world for the Australian Aborigines. Ronald M. Berndt. 7 Vide C. H.
