<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEPTUAGINT OF ISAIAH 36-39 IN RELATION TO THAT OF 1-35, 40-66* MARSHALL S. HURWITZ, New York I Ν THIS Annual, 27 (1956), 193-200, Dr. Harry M. Orlinsky dealt in some detail with "The Treatment of Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Septuagint of Isaiah." "Our conclusion for the LXX translator of Isaiah (Chaps. 36-39 require separate study ...)," he wrote, "is precisely the same as for the LXX trans lators of the Pentateuch and of Job, namely, that whether he did or did not find anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms offensive, he reproduced the Hebrew terms literally and correctly" (p. 200, § 27). However, whereas the words for "hand," "right hand," "mouth," "foot," "voice," "lips," "arm," "eye," and "ear," when referring to God, were reproduced literally, in two instances it appeared as though the anthropomorphic element was handled differently. In 37.17 סטה יהוה אזנף ועמע ?כןח להוה עינף וראה was rendered by είσάκουσον, κύριε,κύριε, εΐσβλεφον,εΐσβλεφον, κύριε-, in 37-29' was turned into 17 πικρία σου σου άνέβη xpos με. As Dr. Orlinsky pointed out: The "eye" (עלן) of the Lord was rendered faithfully (ό οφθαλμοί) in two passages (1.15, 16), and less literally, although not less correctly, in five other instances: 43.4 . . . 49.5 . . . 59.5 . . . 65.12 . . . 66.4 ... In 37.17 ... and 38.3 . . . there is the possibility of anti-anthropomorphism having been at work . . .' At Dr. Orlinsky's suggestion, therefore, I undertook to investigate the Septuagint of Chapters 36-39 in respect to: I. anthropomor phisms, and II. its relation to the rest of the Septuagint of the book of Isaiah. Naturally, the quantity of data available in these four chapters is limited; indeed, there are only two words of anthropomorphic import that bear on our problem, "eye(s)" and "ear(s)." And yet we believe that a careful analysis of these terms (§ I), when combined with other data (§ II), leads to conclusions that are not unreasonable. *This article constitutes Part I of a thesis written under the direction of Dr. Harry M. Orlinsky at the New York School of the Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Hebrew Letters degree. The author wishes to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Orlinsky not only for his valuable suggestions but also for his continuing patience in guiding me through this work. The quotations from the LXX of Isaiah are from ed. J. Ziegler (Gôttingen, 1939). 1 Op. cit., § 15. 75</page><page sequence="2">76 MARSHALL S. hurwitz [2] I.I. Anthropomorphisms in Chapters 36-39 A. (1.) עינלם with reference to God. As one goes through the Hebrew-Greek of Isaiah, and notes how regularly the (עימים of God is reproduced literally by οφθαλμοί (-01), it comes as something of a surprise to read in 37.17 e'i'.σβλεφον, nvpie for קח יהוה עינך ולאה.!. In 1.15 (אעלים) עיני (מכם) was reproduced by (αποστρέφω)(αποστρέφω) τους οφθαλμούς μου; in ν. 16 ;מנגד) עי,נ) by (απέναντι) των των οφθαλμών μου■ and in 33·15 (ועצם (עיניו by (καμμύων) τους οφθαλμούς.οφθαλμούς. The word €1σβλέπ€1ν is used only in 37.17 in the LXX of Isaiah, and but twice elsewhere in the entire Septuagint.2 The verb βλέπβιν is used occasionally in Isaiah to translate 3,ראה but the more usual correspondent is όράομαι. In this passage the verb (ίσβλέπα,ν may be used in an attempt to introduce parallelism, that is, to reflect the preceding άσ άκουσον, or the verb may be used in order to show that the Hebrew which is being translated is not merely ראה. Either way the anthropomorphism is not reproduced. (2.) כעיני with reference to God. Strictly speaking, בעיני is but a prepositional unit, and no feeling of anthropomorphism need be present when a translator renders this term by "before" rather than by "in the eyes of (God)." in 38.3 (להטיב) בעיניך (ע&amp;יתי) was rendered (και τα άρζστά) ένώπιόν σου (έποίησα).(έποίησα). Elsewhere in Isaiah it is the preposition έναντίον that was employed: 43.4 (αφ' ου 'έντιμος έ^/ένου) έναντίον μου / (מא$ר 49-5 ;(;קלת בעיני (και δοζασθήσομαι) έναντίον (κυρίου) / ((ואכבד 65.12 ;בעיני (יהוה) (και έποιήσατ€ το πονηρόν) έναντίον έμου / ותעעל־ הלע) בעיני); and 66.4 (και έποίησαν το πονηρόν) έναντίον μου / 1*עמ!י לל ע) בעיני). Both έναντίον and ένώπιον are simply prepositions," and the Septuagint, correctly, construed בעיני as a preposition.5 22 Both in Job (6.28 and 21.5; Heb. פנה). But Codex Alexandrinus reads enfiXt ireivireiv in both passages. 3 Isa. 6.9; 21.3; 44.18 (and some mss. at 29.18). 4 The Greek kvavr'iov is most commonly used to translate the Hebrew ,ל?ני בעיני and נגד; and evùiriov is commonly used to translate the Hebrew ,לפני ,^עיני נגד, and לנגד; cf. Hatch-Redpath, Concordance-, and M. Johannessohn, Der Gebrauch derder Pràpositionen in der Septuaginta (Berlin, 1925). 3 I omit verse 65.16 which has for וכי נסתרו מעיני (used in reference to God) xai owe avafiriaeTai aiiTÛv kirl rr!v napS'iav, which is not a translation of this clause but rather a confusion with the verse which follows (65.17) where the Hebrew ולא תעלינה על־לב is rendered 0\18' oil oil !ir! hireXdy aiirûv 'eirl 7r\v Kapbiav. If this confusion was intentional then this might be counted as an attempt to avoid an anthropomorphism. It must be noted, however, that the word kmXriaovTai.

Used without a preposition, אזנים, when it refers to God, is translated literally in the one case outside of chapters 36-39 where it appears. 59.1 fj εβάρυνεν το ουs αΰτοΰ / (ולא־כבךה אןנו (מזנזמוע. In 37-17! however, it is paraphrased: da άκουσον, κύριε / הטה יהוה אזנף־ וקזמע.וקזמע. The word είσακούειν is used interchangeably with άκουαν to translate שמע. It is hardly likely that the words הטה .... אזנך were absent from the Vorlage;6 the Hebrew clause seems to have been telescoped by the translator, whether consciously or unconsciously. (4.) With the preposition 9, when it is used in reference to God, באזני is usually translated literally: 5.9 eis τά ώτα κυρίου Σαβαωθ / 22.14 ;באזני יהוה צבאות *v Τ0^ ώσί. κυρίου Σαβαωθ / באזני יהוה צבאות. Apparently באזני was not as easily rendered by a single preposition as was 7.בעיני In 37.29, however, we find: και ή πικρία σου άνέβη προς με με / ושאננף עליה באזני. Here the phrase באזני is rendered by the pronoun 77rpos. (5.) Thus we find that the anthropomorphic passages, few as they are, are treated differently in chapters 36-39 than in the rest of the Septuagint of Isaiah. II. The Relation of 36-39 το the Rest of the Septuagint of Isaiah On closer scrutiny of chapters 36-39 we find that in vocabulary, too, there is a marked difference as compared with the other chapters of the Septuagint of Isaiah. Where, in the other chapters, the translator sometimes resorted to several synonymous equivalents for rendering a single Hebrew word, in these chapters we find an unusual uniformity, almost a one-to-one equivalence of some words. In the following list we shall deal with words and expressions which in the rest of Isaiah are alternated with one or more synonyms, and where the precise content of the synonym in no way differs from the other word. Thus the fact that chapters 36-39 has greater uniformity is not dependent on the context (viz., prose as against poetry) but rather on the subjective choice of the translators. for passive) in verse 16 has already given this verse an increased likeness to verse 17, thus facilitating this scribal error. 6 The word יהוה is retained, and it seems rather improbable that הטה would fall out before 'י and אזנף after it. 7 Thus in English "in the sight of" is far more common and idiomatic than "in the hearing of."</page><page sequence="4">78 MARSHALL S. HURWITZ [4] A. In the Hebrew text of Isaiah, the root נצל in the Niph'al and Hiph'il occurs twenty times, nine of which appear in chapters 36-39. In chapters 1-35 and 40-66 this root is rendered in Greek by three different verbs, k^aipeiv (eights times),8 σώζαν (twice),9 and pvtadai (once).10 Although there is variation, e£cupeiv is the predominant transla tion in these chapters. In 36-39 however, there is an almost uniform equivalence of נצל with ρύ(σθαl (eight times, and possibly a ninth).11 Furthermore, this word, ρύεσθαι., which is used in chapters 36-39 only for נצל, is employed by the translator of chapters 1-35 and 40-66 to translate other words: נאל (eleven times),12 ישע (three times),13 and פדה (once).14 5.29 is the only instance of the use of ρύεσθαι for נצל outside of chapters 36-39. As for the precise content of these words, E. Hatch15 lists all the instances of the use of Qaiptiv, λντρουν, ρΰεσθα 1, and σώζα,ν in the entire Septuagint,16 and concludes that: It is reasonable to infer that, in their Hellenistic use, the Greek words which are thus used interchangeably for the same Hebrew words did not differ, at least materially, from each other in meaning . . .1' B. In the Septuagint of Isa. 36-39, חלה/חלי is translated by μαλακία and μαλακίζεσθαι four times.18 Only once again in the whole Book of .5.29 » .20.6 ;19-20 י •57-13 ;5°-2 ;47-14 ;20 ,44-17 ;43-13 ;22 42 :31-5 8 11 36.14, 15, 18 bis\ 37.12. In the case of 38.6, the mss. read pvtcrdai, but Ziegler reads awÇuv with codices A, א, and Q. A hexaplaric note in the margin of Q tells us that 01 0 reads pbeodai. It is also of interest to point out that in the parallel passage in the Greeek of II Kings 18-20 נצל is more usually rendered by èijaiptiv (the Greek of II Kings 18.29, 30, 34, 35 bis; 19.12). Twice, however, in the parallel pas sage of II Kings the translation is pvtadai (the Greek of II Kings 18.32-33 parallel to Isa. 36.18); and once it is translated by trcûÇtLV (the Greek of II Kings 20.6 parallel to Isa. 38.6). " 44-6; 47-4: 48-17, 20; 49.7; 51.10; 52.9; 54.5, 8; 59.20; and 63.16. 13 49.25, 26; 63.5. In chapters 36-39, י0ע in the Hiph'il is translated by &lt;7d&gt;(*e1P (37-20, 35), which is the usual translation (cf. 19.20; 25.9; 33.22; 35.4; 43.3, 11, 12; 45.22; 46.7; 47.13; 59.1; 60.16; 63.9). 14 50.2. 15 Essays in Biblical Greek (Oxford, 1889), pp. 22-23. 16 The following errors and omissions in his list might be noted; (1) The word count which he gives for נצל = p£1e&lt;r0tit in Isaiah is actually the word count for נא ל נא ל = pbeadai; (2) The word count which he gives for ישע = pbtadac in Isaiah is actually the word count for נצל = pveadat, (typographical errors probably); (3) He omits Isa. 50.2 in the count of פדה =pveadcu, נצל = 'eÇaiptîi'; and Isa. 49.7 in the count of ו)^=נאלtadat,. " Op. cit., p. 23. 18 38.1, 9 (bis); 39.1. In the parallel account in the Greek of II Kings the word àppœareîv is used (20.1, 12). Isa. 38.9 has no parallel in the Greek of II Kings.</page><page sequence="5">[5] THE SEPTUAGINT OF ISAIAH 36-39 79 Isaiah is חלי rendered by μαλακία.19 In chapters 1-35 and 40-66 the Septuagint paraphrases the clause which includes this word four times,20 and when it does attempt to give an equivalent it employs καταδεΐσθαι,"καταδεΐσθαι," κοιηαν," and 7r0ros25 once each. In chapters 1-35 and 40-66 the word μαλακία is used only once, for 24.דכא C. In chapters 1-35 and 40-66, the noun ךבר is translated by λόγοϊ 18 times25 and by ρημα g times.26 In chapters 36-39 דבר appears as λόγοϊ 13 times27 but only once as ρήμα.28 As for the specific content of the words, Eero Repo2' counts all the instances of Rhema and Logos in the Septuagint and concludes his study as follows:50 Doch lasst sich kein feste Regel aufstellen; denn man kann nicht nachweisen, warum dieser oder jener Uebersetzer immer Logos verwendet, wahrend der andere Rhema vorbezugt. Wenn wirklich Rhema und Logos in ihrer Bedeutung geschieden werden miissen, dann 1st doch auffallend, dass nicht einheitlich iibersetzt wurde. He also points out that the translator of Ezekiel uses Logos seventy eight times while the word Rhema appears only three times; in contrast, in the book of Genesis Logos appears three times and Rhema fifty seven times.51 D. The proper noun הוז־ה; is reproduced Ιουδαία in all four cases in chapters 36-39,52 whereas in the rest of the Book Ιούδα is the pre ferred transcription in the proportion of 2:1, viz., Ιουδαία eight times,55 Ιούδα fifteen times.54 We find great inconsistencies in rendering place names in this Book (as in the case of the other books of the Septua gint).55 Sometimes we find the geographical name merely transliter -57-10" •53-4-10 ;17-11 ;14-10 " •53-3" •5• 1 " •33-24 """ 24 53-5• Other Greek renderings are employed in 3.15; 19.10; 53-10; 57.15 (bis). a3 1.10; 2.1, 3; 8.10; 28.14; 29.11, 18, 21; 30.12, 21; 31.2; 45.23; 50.4; 51.16; 58.13; 59.13; 66.2, 5. .66.5 ;59.21 ;58.9 ;55.11 ;44.26 ;42.16 ;40.8 ;16.13 ;8.20 6י 37.4 ;22 ,21 ,13 ,12 ,36.5 י* (bis), 6, 17, 22; 38.4; 39.5, 8. a8 38.7.

The Tetragrammaton is generally rendered κύριοϊ in this Book, as it is in the rest of the Septuagint.38 Our Book, however, alternates among the translations κύριο?,39 0e0s,4° and KvpLOS 0 0εόϊ.41 In chapters 36-39, however, the only alternative for Kvptos is 0εό5,42 never κύριοs ό 0€0s. (See the Chart in § G below.) F. Finally, the most decisive illustration from the word counts is the rendition of מה אמר יהוה. Thackeray43 uses this as a criterion for distinguishing the different translators of Ezekiel and Jeremiah. It is rendered by some translators as τάδε λεγει and by others outcos λέγει.44 In the Septuagint of Isaiah we find as follows: מה אמר Chaps. 1-35, 40-66 Chaps. 36-39 τάδε λέγει 11 times 8 times45 outws λέγει 28 times 1 time46 36 E. g., אד1ם is generally rendered by the Hellenistic Greek equivalent 'Iôou/rcua, and only once transliterated as 'E5co/t (63.1). Again, שמרון is usually hapapua, but in 7.9 it is ־Zopopwv. Both Mwa/3 and Mu&gt;a/3ms are found as renderings of מואב. More remarkable are the contemporizing rendering of place names, as תךשיש / Kapxqbœv in 23.1, 6, 10, and 14 (while in 60.9 and 66.19 it's transliterated dapais); or בשן / TaXiXata in 33.9. 3י Another striking Hellenism in these chapters is the rendition of אךךט by 'A'Apptvia, whereas in all the other appearances of this term in the Septuagint, the transliteration is used. (Gen. 8.4; II Kings 19.37 and Jer. 5i(28).27 all give the transcription 'kpapar). 38 Cf. Baudissin's discussion, Kyrios als Cottesname, etc., especially pp. 156-176 of Volume I. 3' Cf.

III. Conclusions 1. The treatment of the few anthropomorphisms available for study in the Septuagint of Isa. 36-39 is different from that of the rest of the Book. Specifically, throughout the Septuagint of Isaiah anthro pomorphic terms in the Hebrew are translated literally, while in 36-39 they are paraphrased, telescoped, or replaced by prepositions not used elsewhere in the Book for the same terms.</page><page sequence="8">82 MARSHALL S. HURWITZ [8] 2.2. At several significant points the choice of language in the Septuagint of Isa. 36-39 is different from the choice of language found in the rest of the Book. Specifically, a) The vocabulary is occasionally sharply distinct from the vocabulary of the rest of the Book. b) There is less use of interchanging synonyms. c) The handling of geographical place-names is sometimes different. 3. These differences may be explained by another translator's hand at work. To argue that the demands of prose (in contrast to the poetry in the rest of the Book) changed the style is denied by the fact that the translator of the parallel text in II Kings 18-20 retained the anthropomorphisms, — see the Appendix below — and that the Luci anic recension of II Kings, which seems to have a predilection for changing εν οφθαΚμοΙϊ κυρίου to ενώπιον, does not change the key anthropomorphisms in II Kings 18-20. APPENDIX The Septuagint of Isa. 36-39 and II Kings 18-20 Finally, a comparison of the Septuagint of Isa. 36-39 with its counter part in II Kings 18-20 reveals the peculiarity of the handling of anthropomorphisms in this part of Isaiah. Generally II Kings tends to be more literal than Isaiah. We find, however, fewer examples of anthropomorphisms in the Hebrew text of II Kings than in the Book of Isaiah (due, perhaps, to the fact that it is predominantly narrative prose). Nevertheless, there is one recur rent formula לעשות הישר / הרע בעיני ה' which permits of "anti anthropomorphic" rendering. It may be taken literally — i. e., in the eyes of Gcd, εν οφθαλμοΐς κυρίου or figuratively — i. e., before God, ενώπιον κύριου. Of the thirty-one47 appearances of this formula, only four times48 is it rendered by ενώπιον. All other instances of this formula are translated by εν hipdaXpols (κυρίου). In the Lucianic manuscripts (Brooke-McLean b ο r c2 60), however, we find the ratio reversed. These manuscripts read ενώπιον in twenty-six of the thirty-one ;16.2 ;34 ,28 ,24 ,18 '9 '15-3 ;24 -14-3 ;11 ,13-2 ;12.3 ;10.30 ;27 ,8.18 ;18 .3-2" 17.2, 17; 18.3; 20.3; 21.2, 6, 15, 16, 20; 22.2; 23.32, 37; 24.9, 19. «8 8.18, 27; 12.3; 14.24. (In Codex A add 20.3; 23.37; &gt;n Codex B add 24.19).</page><page sequence="9">[9] THE SEPTUAGINT OF ISAIAH 36-39 83 instances49 of the use of this formula. If there was a consistent attempt on the part of the Lucianic revision to avoid anthropomorphisms, as the above statistics might suggest, then it would be most evident in: II Kings 19.16 |j Isa. 37.17 הטה ה' את אזניך ושסע, פקח ה' את עיניך וראה We find, however, that the Lucianic recension concurs with the other manuscripts of II Kings in reading κΧΐνον, κύριε, to ouy σον καΐκαΐ άκουσον, ανοιξον, κύριε, tovs οψθα\μού$ σου καΐ ϊδε. Now, if the Lucianic recension changed ev όφθαλμοΐς (κυρίου) to ενώπιον because of a desire to avoid anthropomorphisms, would it not likewise be sensitive to פקח את עיניך? We find, however, this clause rendered literally. It seems that the reading of בעיני as a prepositional unit in the Lucianic recension is merely stylistic. Yet the translator of Isa. 36-39 felt that not only was ενώπιον better than εν όφθαλμοΐς (κυρίου) (cf. 38.3), but even in 37.17 he felt it necessary to paraphrase the mention of God's eyes and ears. יי The five exceptions are: 10.30; 15.18; 16.2; 20.3; 21.16.</page></plain_text>
