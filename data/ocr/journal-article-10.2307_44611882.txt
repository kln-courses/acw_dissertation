France Legault Transport Canada George Salcudean and David Hillebrandt RONA Kinetics and Associates Ltd. William Gardner and Mathieu Labrecque Transport Canada ABSTRACT This paper describes the development of an interface system for attaching infant and child restraints and booster cushions to passenger vehicles. The resulting prototype, known as CANFIX is based on the ISOFIX concept which was conceived in Sweden. The CANFIX design comprises two rear attachments to be secured to two anchorage points located behind the vehicle seat bight. In forward-facing child restraints, the CANFIX system also includes the tether anchorage feature. The results of preliminary dynamic testing of three CANFIX modified restraint systems are presented in the paper with the results of tests to examine the compatibility of the CANFIX system with current vehicle seats. BACKGROUND REVIEW By law, passenger vehicle drivers in Canada must ensure that all infants and children are properly secured in child restraint systems which meet pertinent Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, CMVSS [1]. New born children must be secured in a rear-facing restraint system which meets CMVSS 213.1. The restraint system can be used forward-facing when the child is at least 9 kg and their neck muscles are strong enough to support the weight of his or her head or the child can sit for long periods unaided [2,3]. All forward-facing child restraint systems sold in Canada are fitted with a tether strap to meet the requirements of CMVSS 213. For this reason, all passenger vehicles sold in Canada since 1 989 have pre-drilled or threaded anchorage locations for the installation of tether strap anchor hardware. When the child has outgrown their child restraint system, he or she should be placed in a booster cushion or seat certified to CMVSS 213.2. The booster seat is designed to improve the position of the adult seat belt particularly over the pelvic region of the small child. The effectiveness of correctly used infant and child restraint systems in reducing injuries during road traffic accidents is well established [4-6]. The potential benefit of infant and child restraint systems may, however, be significantly compromised through their misuse or non- use [7,8]. Given the diversity of infant and child restraint systems, passenger vehicle seats and harness systems, the opportunities for misuse are high. In a 1992 study of the restraint of young children in Ontario, Canada, a high incidence of misuse was observed [9,10]. Of the infant restraints observed in detail, 5% were not attached to the vehicle and in 1 1% of the cases the infant restraint harness was not used. There were 703 child restraints observed in detail and the tether strap was not used in 62% of these cases. The failure to use locking clips with continuous loop lap/shoulder belts and the use of an inappropriate restraint system for the size of the child were two other serious and relatively common types of misuse. The problem of misuse is not confined to Canada [4,1 1]. ISOFIX In recognition of the worldwide problem of misuse, some safety researchers in Sweden conceived a new universal interface system "ISOFIX" for attaching infant and child restraints to all passenger cars [12]. The first prototype of an ISOFIX system was presented by the Swedish delegation in 1991 to the International Organization for Standardization Working Group on Child Restraint Systems (ISO/TC22/SC12/WG1). The original ISOFIX concept was a simple "plug-in" system whereby a child restraint was attached directly to the 1796</page><page sequence="2">vehicle seat structure. Such a simple universal system for mounting infant and child restraints is considered a most desirable option for reducing the opportunity for misuse. This work has been an important part of the activities of the ISO Working Group on Child Restraints and a number of different design concepts have since been developed and tested. The work has resulted in a recommendation that the UK proposal known as UNIFIX should be adopted for all ISOFIX child restraints. UNIFIX is a four-point attachment system with two fixation points at the bight of the vehicle seat (within the intersection of the seat back and seat cushion) and two more points at the front edge of the seat [131. The original simple and effective ISOFIX concept was supported by the Canadian ISO representatives. In comparison, the latest UNIFIX proposal is more complex and costly for both the vehicle and child restraint manufacturers and is probably less likely to be adopted by North American manufacturers. Out of concern that the benefits of ISOFIX may be lost to much of the world if a more appropriate solution was not explored, Transport Canada issued a contract to RONA Kinetics in 1994 to develop and prototype a version of one of the original ISOFIX proposals. The main design criteria were: • to utilise the rear mounting attachment points of UNIFIX and the tether anchorage feature already required in passenger vehicles in Canada and Australia, and available in cars in the United States of America and New Zealand. • to develop a user-friendly child restraint/vehicle attachment system which would promote correct use and reduce the opportunity for misuse. The resulting prototype which is based on the original ISOFIX proposal is known as the CANFIX. One CANFIX interface system was designed to accommodate the three main categories of child restraints* i.e. rear-facing infant restraints, forward- facing child restraints and booster cushions. The CANFIX design comprises two rear attachments to be secured to two anchorage points located behind the vehicle seat bight. In forward-facing child restraints, the CANFIX system also includes the tether anchorage feature. * In this paper, the term child restraints refers to the three main categories of child restraint systems, i.e. rear-facing infant restraints, forward-facing child restraints and booster cushions, unless otherwise specified. CANFIX DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS The CANFIX system was designed to attach securely to the rear points of the vehicle ISOFIX anchorages as specified in the draft ISO/WD 13216. In accordance with these draft specifications, the vehicle ISOFIX anchorages shall be two horizontal bars of 6 mm diameter with a minimum effective length of 25 mm. The transverse pitch of the bars shall be 280 mm. The centre of the rear anchorages shall be at least 120 mm behind the vehicle seat reference point (R-point). The static strength of the attachment points shall be tested by the application of a 10 kN load and the horizontal excursion at the point of loading shall be within specified limits. The CANFIX attachments were designed to fully engage with the ISOFIX rear anchorage points without accidental release. The overall dimensions of the CANFIX latches on the child restraints were designed to meet the requirements specified in the draft ISO/WD 13216. The CANFIX hardware attached to the child restraints was designed to meet the dynamic testing requirements of current child restraint regulations, viz. CMVSS 213, 213.1, 213.2 and the proposed CVMSS 213.4, when fitted to the vehicle test seat via the two rear ISOFIX anchorages. In addition, there shall be no partial or complete separation of the CANFIX load bearing structural elements during the impact simulation. In accordance with the original philosophy of the ISOFIX concept, CANFIX was designed for easy use without reducing the safety and comfort of other passengers. Special emphasis was given to reducing the opportunities for misuse and to providing an attachment system that was cost effective to both child restraint and vehicle manufacturers. MODIFICATION OF EXISTING CHILD RESTRAINTS One sample of each category of child restraint system (available in Canada and approved to applicable Canadian Standards) was selected for modification with the CANFIX design. The convertible Fisher Price Model AC9189 was selected for the infant and child restraint CANFIX prototypes. The booster cushion selected for modification was the Gerry Double Guard Model 675 which has an incorporated lap belt. Two samples of each type of restraint system were purchased 1797</page><page sequence="3">for testing. One set of samples was modified with the CANFIX interface system as shown in Figure 1. The modification of each child restraint required an independent structural base to attach CANFIX to the existing child restraint fixture. This interface was fabricated from square steel tubing for testing purposes. Accordingly the mass of each CANFIX modified child restraint is higher than the unmodified restraint. For future user trials, a lighter working/demonstration model of a CANFIX modified forward-facing child restraint was fabricated using aluminium tubing and a tether strap fitted to a retractor reel. This retractable tether strap is part of an interlock design concept to increase the correct use of the CANFIX/tether system in forward-facing child restraints. There was no structural platform on the back of the forward-facing child restraint which could be used for installing the retractor reel for the dynamic test, so the CANFIX prototype was tested using the existing tether strap system. In production the seat and frame stiffening to accommodate CANFIX would be an integral part of the child restraint design. It is anticipated that the only significant increase in mass associated with CANFIX would be the use of a retractor reel mechanism for the tether strap and the CANFIX latch mechanism. In addition the production costs of a CANFIX child restraint are not likely to increase significantly. DYNAMIC TESTS The seats were tested at the Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine in Toronto. The Standard Seat used to test child restraints was modified for testing the CANFIX prototypes. In accordance with ISO/WD 13216, the ISOFIX/CANFIX anchorages fitted to the test seat were two horizontal bars of 6 mm diameter with an effective length of 25 mm. The transverse pitch of the bars was 280 mm located 75 mm rear of the CR point (seat bight). The two 6 mm pins were mounted horizontally in a flat plate which was secured to an upright rigid fixture attached to the test sled. Load cells were installed between the flat plate and the upright fixture on the same axes as the pins. In the infant and child restraint tests, two Lebow load cells were used. The distance between the load cells on the flat plate was 158 mm. Each load cell had a capacity of 1000 lb. In the dynamic test of the CANFIX booster cushion a single 3000 lb. Lebow load cell was installed beside the left attachment pin (looking from behind). A spacer block was installed on the right hand side. The Standard Seat vehicle lap belt loads and the tether strap loads were measured in accordance with the Motor Vehicle Safety Test Methods 209. Figure 1 : CANFIX Interface System Attached to Forward-Facing Child Restraint 1798</page><page sequence="4">The modified infant and child restraint systems were tested in accordance with dynamic test procedures derived from the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Test Methods 213.1 and 2 1 3 respectively to facilitate a direct comparison with the dynamic test conducted on the unmodified child restraints. The unmodified infant and child restraint systems were tested in accordance with CMVSS 213.1 and 213 respectively. The dynamic test with the CANFIX child restraint was repeated to confirm the head and chest acceleration measurements. Both booster cushions were tested in accordance with a test procedure derived from the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Test Methods 213 for Child Restraint Systems and the proposed CMVSS 213.4 for Built-in Child Restraint Systems and Built-in Booster Cushions, but using a six-year old anthropomorphic test device. A summary of the testing is given in Table 1 . RESULTS OF DYNAMIC TESTS A comparison of the test results and the CMVSS requirements for each category of child restraint is presented in Tables 2 to 4.

During the impact simulation, the maximum angle between the back and the head support system of the rear-facing infant restraint seat (measured 240 mm above the scat surface) was 46° and 49° for the unmodified and CANFIX designs respectively. CMVSS 213.1 specifies that this angle shall not exceed 70 degrees. With the forward-facing CANFIX restraint system, the forward most movement of the entire head was the same as that measured with the unmodified child restraint, i.e. 597 mm (23.5"), well within the specified limits in CMVSS 213 of 720 mm (28.4"). As previously noted, the booster cushions were tested with a six-year old anthropomorphic test device and not the three-year old dummy specified in the proposed CMVSS 213.4. The resultant head and chest accelerations for both the unmodified and CANFIX booster cushions were within the limits specified in the proposed CMVSS 213.4. For built-in booster cushions the maximum allowable accelerations are head 80 g and chest 60 g. The attachment loads measured during the dynamic testing are presented in Table 5. The resulting loads on the rear attachments were tolerated by the vehicle seat rear anchorages designed to the ISOFIX draft specifications ISO/WD 13216. The CANFIX systems remained attached to the vehicle seat and there was no separation of the CANFIX load bearing structural elements. After the impact simulation, each CANFIX system could be released by hand and there was no visible structural deformation of the CANFIX attachments on the child restraints.

This is probably attributable to the greater mass of the CANFIX system and the rigidity of the attachment hardware compared to the flexible seat belt system on the unmodified restraint which amortises the loads at the support points. The attachment loads would be significantly reduced on a CANFIX production unit of lower mass. A review of the test films shows that during the initial impact simulation there is relatively little forward movement of the CANFIX modified infant restraint relative to the test bench seat base. The modified infant restraint only rotates downwards about the CANFIX "vehicle" attachment points as the test bench cushion depresses. In comparison the unmodified infant restraint system moves forward and downward as the lap belt takes up the loads and the bench seat is depressed. During rebound the unmodified infant restraint rotates towards the bench seat back such that the infant dummy is essentially encapsulated between the test seat and the infant restraint. In contrast the CANFIX restraint did not rotate significantly on rebound. The distribution of the attachment loads measured during the testing of the forward-facing child restraints were very different for the CANFIX compared to the unmodified system. The CANFIX loads were similar at each attachment point, including the tether anchorage. The discrete vehicle lap belt loads measured during the testing of the unmodified child restraint were about one third the tether strap load. An analysis of the test films of the unmodified child restraint shows that the forward movement of the child restraint is initially arrested by the tether strap. The vehicle lap belt slides along the child restraint frame and appears to be fully loaded nearer the end of the impact simulation. The results highlight the importance of correct tether strap use to maintain good vehicle seat interface with current child restraints and vehicle belt systems. In contrast the maximum forward movement of the CANFIX child restraint is more limited and the loading is more evenly distributed over the three attachment points. The secure linkage of the child restraint to the vehicle seat throughout the impact simulation probably also accounted for the lower head and chest accelerations measured during the CANFIX test compared to the unmodified child restraint test. Head excursion was comparable. During the dynamic testing of the booster cushions the attachment loads on the left side were similar for both the CANFIX and the unmodified boosters. (An additional load cell was not available to measure the load on the right CANFIX attachment bracket.) For the dynamic tests the unmodified booster cushion was secured to the vehicle seat via the lap belt fastened through the back of the booster cushion (in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions) before the dummy was installed. This enabled the booster cushion to be tightly secured to the test bench and would account for the similar performance and loading of the attachment points which was observed during the impact simulation of both the CANFIX and the unmodified system. During some of the tests the seat base cushion on the test bench appeared to be fully depressed and the child restraint system may have bottomed-out on the underlying rigid platform. This test series highlights that the Standard Seat (vehicle test bench) does not reflect current passenger vehicle seat designs. It would be valuable to repeat the test series with both the unmodified and CANFIX child restraints using a more representative vehicle seat. The test results indicate that a system utilising the two rear attachment points of the proposed ISOFIX vehicle interface will provide comparable protection in frontal impacts to current child restraints. Subject to confirmation by further testing, the strength of each rear attachment point must be capable of withstanding a dynamic horizontal force of about 5.5 kN (1236 lbf). This force is not a design load and does not include any safety factor. It is derived from the highest load of 5.3 kN (1182 lbf) which was measured on one attachment point during the CANFIX testing. VEHICLE FIT TESTS The compatibility of the CANFIX system with current vehicles was examined by trying to "fit" the CANFIX forward-facing child restraint demonstration model in the passenger seats of 35 vehicles as shown in Figure 2. The CANFIX model was placed on the passenger seat and an attempt was made to push the CANFIX attachments into the seat bight. If the attachments could be pushed back between the seat cushions, CANFIX was considered compatible with the seat design. It was possible to "install" the CANFIX child restraint system in the front passenger seat of 33 (94.3%) of the vehicles. The CANFIX child restraint could not be installed easily in two of the front seats due to overlapping vehicle seat backs and cushions. The CANFIX system could be installed in the rear outboard seating positions in 29 (93.5%) of the 31 vehicles with rear seats. An overlapping seat 1802</page><page sequence="8">Figure 2: "Installing" CANFIX Forward-Facing Child Restraint in Passenger Car Seat back/cushion prevented the installation of the CANFIX system in one rear seat and in another vehicle the CANFIX child restraint could only be installed if the front seat back was vertical. A summary of the results of the vehicle fit tests is presented in Table 6. CONCLUDING COMMENTS The primary design goals of the CANFIX system were to utilise the ISOFIX and/or UNIFIX concept and hardware and the tether anchorage feature already available in passenger cars in North America, Australia 1803 and New Zealand and to develop a universal interface system which is easy to use and promotes the correct use of infant and child restraint systems. The testing conducted to date is preliminary, but it clearly demonstrates the potential of utilising the two rear attachment features of the ISOFIX system to secure child restraints in passenger vehicles. The performance of the CANFIX system in non-frontal test configuration has not yet been examined. Future dynamic testing with child dummies with neck load measuring capabilities is being considered and tests are being conducted on each CANFIX modified restraint system to determine the resultant load at the CANFIX anchorage points when a 10 kN static load is applied in accordance with the draft ISOFIX specifications. The greatest potential benefit of the CANFIX compared to current child restraints is that the use and proper use of all types of child restraints will increase. To encourage the correct use of the CANFIX system in the forward-facing mode, an interlock with the tether strap is desirable. Future enhancements might also include a design which would make a non-attached child restraint an unusable system. The development of an interlock system and the evaluation of the CANFIX working model in user trials is being considered. A universal interface system for mounting child restraint systems in passenger vehicles, which is easy to use, has die potential to provide additional safety for children by reducing the likelihood of injuries which may occur through the misuse or non-use of current designs of restraint systems.
