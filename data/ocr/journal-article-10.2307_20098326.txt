<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS J. BLAKELEY SARTRE'S CRITIQUE DE LA RAISON DIALECTIQUE AND THE OPACITY* OF MARXISM-LENINISM Far more interesting than the as yet stumbling East-West dialogue is the give and take between Soviet and non-Soviet Marxist philosophers. This exchange has been going on for some years: unfortunately, it seldom has been anything more than puerile polemic. With the publication of Sartre's Critique1 the situation has completely changed. This book is conceived as a total critique of Marxism-Leninism, accomplished through a 'penetra tion' to the real meaning of Marx. To the considerable extent that Sartre succeeds in this volume in re-presenting Marxian man and the Marxian view of society he issues a challenge to Marxist-Leninists, which they can ignore only at the peril of seeing the entirety of dialectical and historical materialism dismissed as so much bad commentary. The situation described in this article is significant not only for the status of Marxism-Leninism but also for an understanding of the point to which Sartre and a certain form of existentialism have progressed. We shall, therefore, begin with the almost impossible task of briefly outlining the content of Sartre's Critique. In a second section we shall extract the critiques he specifically directs toward Marxism-Leninism and attempt to see to what extent they are valid. Finally, we shall examine the responses which Sartre's work has evoked from the Soviets. I. FROM PESSIMISTIC INDIVIDUALISM TO SOCIAL OPTIMISM Whatever else might be said about the general philosophical position of Sartre, previous to the Critique, it seems that one can safely characterize L'?tre et le n?ant as expressing a basically pessimistic individualism (what ever this last word might mean in an existentialist work). The individual is 6refoul?\ 'frustr?' ; the prime characteristic of his acts is 'failure', etc. The Critique is - if not a totally new departure - at least a more optimistic view in that it allows for a progressively successive collaboration of men in social groups. Like the individual in L'?tre et le n?ant, the social group in the Critique is ultimately frustrated: but - and here lies the essential 122 Studies in Soviet Thought VIII (1968) 122-135; ? D. Reidel, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">SARTRE AND THE OPACITY OF MARXISM-LENINISM difference - the frustration of the group is causally linked to the liberty of the individuals making it up: in a sense human freedom loses its essential negativity through transcendence into group-formation as the operative form of being-outside-of-self. This is not to say that all is love and light in the Critique: there is an almost Hobbesian interpretation of violence: the backdrop of all human activity is 'scarcity' {raret?). However, the main thrust of the Critique is away from absurdity, toward meaning; one would be tempted to expect to see in the promised second volume some sort of 'philosophy of hope' - under 'dialectical wraps', of course. The type of phenomenological method used by Sartre makes it impossible to guarantee an exact replay of what he wants to say. We shall, therefore, limit ourselves to reproducing certain key passages in an effort to isolate and' correlate the fundamental notions which - as it were - constitute the 'skeleton' of the Critique. The reader's first impression is that Sartre in the Critique is obsessed with the question of method. Not only does the volume open with 111 pages of 'Question de m?thode'2 but the main treatise itself is also pre faced with 47 pages (pp. 115-162) on method, entitled 'Dialectique dog matique et dialectique critique'. Methodological considerations lie strewn throughout the remainder of the work, too. The reasons for this seem reasonably clear: (a) contemporary philosophers are generally wrapped up in discussion of questions of method; (b) in order to set himself off from the Marxist-Leninists, Sartre has to make clear how his dialectical method differs from theirs; and (c) the success of the whole Sartrian enterprise in the Critique depends on establishing that his dialectical method is: (1) not a priori (pp. 115-118); (2) not dogmatic but auto creative (pp. 118-120); (3) historical against positivism (pp. 121-123); and (4) based on man rather than nature - against diamat (pp. 123-135). 'Totality' and 'totalisation' are the key notions for an understanding of Sartre's 'dialectical reason'. "Totality is defined as a being which, while basically distinct from the sum of its parts, is found in its entirety - in one form or another - in each of these, and which relates to itself either by means of its relationship to one or many of its parts or by means of its relationship to the relations existing between all or some of its parts. ... totalisation has the same status as totality... but it is an act in progress which cannot stop without the multiplicity returning to its original status" 123</page><page sequence="3">THOMAS J. BLAKELEY (p. 138). A reader familiar with Sartre's style could predict the word-games that would result from such a terminology. For example: "Mais, par la r?ciprocit? m?me des contraintes et des autonomies, la loi finit par ?chapper ? tous et c'est dans le mouvement tournant de la totalisation qu'elle appara?t comme Raison dialectique, c'est-?-dire ext?rieure ? tous parce qu'int?rieure ? chacun et totalisation en cours mais sans totalisateur de toutes les totalisations totalis?es et de toutes les totalit?s d?totalis?es" (p. 134). On the basis of these notions, Sartre describes his method as 'totalising activity' {activit? totalisatrice) and specifies: "If the dialectic exists, we should experience it as the indomitable strictness of the totalisa tion which totalises us, and (we should) grasp it in its freely practical spontaneity as the totalising practice {praxis) which we are" (p. 157). The considerations on method end in a distinction between intellection and comprehension: "Therefore, I call intellection all temporalising and dialectical evidences in as far as they must be able to totalise all practical realities and I limit the denomination comprehension to the totalising grasp of each practice {praxis) in as far as it is intentionally produced by its author or authors" (p. 162). The main body of Sartre's Critique is divided into two parts: 'From Individual "Practice" to the Practical-Inert' (pp. 165-377) and 'From the Group to History' (pp. 381-755). A second volume is to take up history as-such. As he promised in his methodological introduction, Sartre puts man immediately into the center of the treatise. Man mediates things to the same extent as things mediate man ('dialectical circularity'). 'Need' {besoin) is the basis of the relationship man-thing: "Need as the negation of nega tion is the organism itself living itself in the future, through present dis orders, as its own possibility and, therefore, as its own impossibility; and practice is primarily nothing but the relationship of the organism as external and future goal to the here-and-now organism as a totality in danger" (p. 168). Danger comes to the organism from 'scarcity' {la raret?). And it is practice in function of the future which constitutes the world: "the inert multiplicity becomes totality because (it is) unified by the goal {fin) as instrumental domain; it is itself the goal fallen into the domain of passivity" (p. 171). 'Work' is the privileged phenomenal form of man's insertion into the world: "Determination of the present by the future; 124</page><page sequence="4">SARTRE AND THE OPACITY OF MARXISM-LENINISM criss-cross of the inert and organic; negation, contradictions overcome, negation of negation; in short, totalisation in progress - these are the aspects of any work at all" (p. 174). In work totalising man constitutes (int?riorises) the milieu worked {mati?re ouvr?e) or to be worked, thereby exteriorising himself as inert. This is the sense of the 'practical-inert'; and it is also a rather accurate rendition of Marx' animal laborans. Turning to the matter of human relations, Sartre says: "Reciprocal and ternary relations are the basis of all the relationships between men" (p. 191). "...reciprocity is a permanent structure of each object: pre defined as things by collective practice, we transcend our being by produc ing ourselves as men among men and we let ourselves be integrated by each to the exact extent that each has to be integrated into our project" (p. 189). And this reciprocity is not abstract: it is concretely realized in on-going practice. Ternary relations are explained as follows : "Thus unity comes from the outside to duality through the practice of the third {du tiers)... the relationship of the third to the dyad is of interiority because it changes itself in changing it (the dyad). But the relation is not reciprocal ...the dyad becomes a team {?quipe) not by producing its totality but by first undergoing it as determination of being" (p. 197). In other words, the tiers unifies the two components of the dyad in as far as they form part of his 'practical-inert' domain. It is important to note that the practical inert domain of each of the components of the dyad is not immediately accessible as such to the tiers. Ultimately it is scarcity which serves to found the whole structure: "The negative unity of scarcity interiorised in the reification of reciprocity re-exteriorises itself for all of us in the unity of the world as the locus of our oppositions; and we reinteriorise this unity in a new, negative unity: we are united by the fact of inhabiting a world determined by scarcity" (p. 211). But there are two types of human mediation: "the first is a common, deliberate, synthetic practice uniting men (exploited or not) in the same undertaking with the same object in mind" (p. 239). In the second type: "at the confines of the undertaking the same men (or others) establish themselves in reference to the common practice as Others, i.e., the synthetic interiority of the group is traversed by the reciprocal exteriority of the individuals, which constitutes their material separation" (p. 240). This second type of mediation is called 'serial' by Sartre and it later serves him as basis for distinguishing 'the group' (which 'transcends' the serial) 125</page><page sequence="5">THOMAS J. BLAKELEY from 'the collective' (which is simply serial). In the meantime he concludes : "Thus materialised practice...has the effect of uniting men to the same extent as it separates them by imposing on each and every one a meaning ful reality which is infinitely richer and more contradictory than the result they were individually expecting" (p. 246) and goes into the function of 'interest' {V?tre-tout-entier-hors-de-soi-dans-une-chos?) which he defines as "a negative and practical relationship of man to the practical domain through the thing which is outside or, in the other direction, a relationship of the thing to other things in the social domain through its human object" (p. 267). In this perspective the worker in bourgeois society is one of whom it can be said: "Thus, not only is it the case that his being pre exists him and exists outside of him in the movement of the economy and ultimately in this machine (or in these tools) which calls to him, but it is also the case that this Being represents a pure abstraction of him ; his being-object waits for him and patiently produces him at a distance" (p. 269). Whence follows the conclusion that the worker has no individual interests: and this is the origin of class-interests. The '?tre de classe' is "the practical-inert status of individual or collective practice, the future sentence (which is) petrified in the past-being which this practice itself must accomplish and where it must finally recognize itself in a novel experience of necessity" (p. 302). Sartre's notion of necessity involves the unrestrained activity of the individual who assumes full responsibility for action. Sartre ends the first section with an enormous amount of verbiage destined to make clear his notion of the collective. It would be futile to try to follow his peregrinations here - although along the way he does make some useful distinctions. We will content ourselves with some indi cations on the notion of 'collective' which plays a key role in the second part of the book. Operative in the collective is 'seriality' which describes the 'non-totalising totality' of individuals, each of whom is 'Other' to the 'Other' so that each is related to the other through the practical-inert: man becomes a function of the domain of the practical-inert, which is 'worked matter' {la mati?re ouvr?e). The 'class' is a collective, where each worker is linked to the other by being - like the 'other' - a 'work-thing', impotent vis-?-vis the capitalist. This first section of the Critique seems to have an over-all dialectical (or triadic) structure: individual practice (the thesis) finds and realises but, 126</page><page sequence="6">SARTRE AND THE OPACITY OF MARXISM-LENINISM at the same time, loses itself in the practical-inert (the antithesis), resulting in a symbiosis where the man-thing and thing-man are realised in 'serial practice'. It remains for Sartre to find the locus of 'common practice'. This is the work of the second section. By now we are familiar with the direction of Sartre's thought so that we can foresee that the second section of the Critique will also have a basic dialectic. It does. From the dialectical dynamic between collective ('serial practice') and group ('common practice') results History as the practice of all practices. Again it was predictable that a key role would be played by the tiers which Sartre here defines as "the human mediation through which the multiplicity of epicenters and goals (identical and separate) directly gets its organisation as determined by a synthetic objective" (p. 398). To the extent that the tiers mediates not just one but many dyads ('exteriorised interiorities') he expresses the congruence of totalisations: which means that the group is "totalisation in progress" (p. 412). The paradigm of the group is the 'action group' which is a "movement of actualisation of common practice happening at about the same time in all the tiers as such" (p. 417). The group arises from the collective through the overcoming of seriality : there is a practical ubiquity of liberty: each tiers grasps what was 'other' as the 'same' : there is a totalisation of totalisations. But this totalisation cannot be fully totalised without falling back from group to collective. Sartre analyzes the oath as a means which a group-in-formation uses to prevent backsliding into the collective: the foundation of the oath is fear - fear before the realization of the impossibility of complete totalisation and fear of returning to the collective. The group also tries to maintain itself by giving itself an 'idea' and by assigning 'functions' to its members. All in vain! "Multiplicity is thus reactualised in its insurmountable objec tivity by the practical-inert and the practical-inert is nothing other than the activity of the others in as far as it is supported and derailed by inorganic inertia. It is then a passivised form of activity which reactualises the latent multiplicity, and the group - as dialectical practice - grasps it in its very dispersion as an internal danger, i.e., as a dispersion produced by the unity of an act" (p. 547). True sociality disappears: the tiers r?gula teur ceases to synthesise: institutions are created to preserve the goals of 127</page><page sequence="7">THOMAS J. BLAKELEY the group but the individuals are now 'other' in the collective rather than 'same' in the group. In short, things fall apart. All of this is due to "the rediscovery of free individuality as the sole means and sole obstacle in the constitution of an organised group" (p. 571). In other words, only human freedom makes the formation of the group possible : but this same free dom comes back to haunt the group; prevents it from total totalisation; and ultimately forces it to dissolve into the collective. There is a pleasant interlude where Sartre uses the 'hit parade' as an example of how in an institutionalised collective a group can use seriality as a tool to keep all others other in reference to all others, i.e., to create a 'recurrent seriality' which impedes the formation of any other groups at all. Bureaucracy is precisely the result of what Sartre calls 'extero-condi tioning'. Finally, Sartre produces a long and complicated analysis of the history of capitalism (as antithesis of the working class), the point of which is that as long as the human comedy takes place against a background of scarcity the basic situation will be 'conflict' {lutt?) because man in these circumstances is violently opposed to man - as 'other'. Thus, we come full circle to Marx' conception of history as the history of class-conflict. II. SARTRE AS A HISTORICAL MATERIALIST Sartre sets out in the Critique (p. 9) to develop a Marxist anthropology. He sees existentialism as a methodological 'enclave' in Marxism which is the 'unbeatable philosophy of our time'. Both of these stand in direct contradiction to Soviet Marxism-Leninism which considers its historical materialism to be the last word in Marxist theory of man and society and which rejects out of hand existentialism and its phenomenological method. We will examine some of Sartre's critiques of Marxism-Leninism and then evaluate them from the point of view of traditional historical materialism. But first a note on Sartre's 'Marxism'. Is Jean-Paul Sartre a Marxist? He not only claims to be one but presents his Critique as being essentially the anthropology underlying the sociologi cal theories of Marx. Is there any justification for this? It seems to us that Sartre is a Marxist in the best meaning of the word: i.e., he has taken the essential insights of Marx the sociologist and given them a solid foundation in the form of a total doctrine on man. One can 128</page><page sequence="8">SARTRE AND THE OPACITY OF MARXISM-LENINISM argue with the doctrine: one can hardly contest its solidity. More than this, Sartre has overcome the irritating and petty distinction between the 'early' and the 'late' Marx. Basically, he does this by isolating out and destroying the accidental accretions due to ('poor old unphilosophic') Engels. A case in point is the famous 'dialectic of nature'. Sartre points out that Engels' enterprise is to say the least premature: one has to establish historical materialism before one can seriously worry about any dialectic of nature - if one even has to worry about it then (cf. pp. 129-135) ! More precisely, however, Sartre begins with the same man as the so-called 'early' Marx, i.e., the animal laborans who finds himself alienated in an improperly structured world - and the improper structuring is due to man(!) for both Sartre and Marx. Sartre ends up - as does the so-called 'late' Marx - with man's conscious efforts to escape out of an unjust (inhuman) social context into another, more just (more free) one by means of violence {lutte des classes). Thus, in a sense, Sartre provides a basis on which Marx becomes more Marx than was at all possible on the sole basis of his own works. Whether or not Marx would agree with Sartre's results is really not our problem. The question of Sartre's confrontation with contemporary Soviet Marxism Leninism can be seen from two different - albeit complementary - points of view: (a) the assimilability of Sartre's doctrine on man and society, as described above, to the tenets of historical materialism; (b) the validity of Sartre's explicit criticisms of what he calls le marxisme id?aliste which is held by les simplistes du marxisme. While an optimistic view on man and society is 'natural' to historical materialism, the existential-phenomenological method is not. To the extent that Sartre founds his 'dialectical reason' in the practising individual, he commits the cardinal sin of reducing social being (practical man in real society) to social consciousness (the ideologies, especially in their psycho analytic form). He is thus guilty of 'objective idealism'. To the extent that Sartre makes individual practice and individual liberty the impregnable foundations of his conception of man and society, he is guilty of 'bourgeois individualism', which refuses to recognize that the value and validity of history transcends the mere individual with his subjective need {besoin), goals {fins), and milieu {la mati?re ouvr?e / the practical-inert). For that matter, historical materialism would see the 129</page><page sequence="9">THOMAS J. BLAKELEY practical-inert as an anthropomorphism since it designates matter as receiving its specification not from objective laws of the dialectic but from the practising subject. This is rank subjective idealism. The tiers which plays such a key role in Sartre's account of the establish ment and functioning of human relations is also a subjective-idealist conception. The third's grasping of the other two is of significance only within the context of the Marxist-Leninist categories of forces and rela tions of production: but these are independent of the mind and will of man. Sartre's distinction between the collective and the group may have some heuristic value for the understanding of history. But, it is based on the same subjectivist notions of tiers, besoin, etc. Ultimately then, Marxist Leninist objections to Sartre's conceptions will all be reducible to his stress on the role of individual liberty and individual practice in an anthro pology which would serve as a means to understanding history. This - as we see it - is Sartre's typically 'Marxist' failing. The situation is fairly exactly reversed when we turn to examine Sartre's explicit criticisms of le marxisme id?aliste. Since these criticisms are spread over the 700 and some pages of the Critique, we will try to group them into major categories and limit ourselves to quoting only representative passages. The following divisions are not mutually exclusive: (a) social political criticism (pp. 25-28 and 629-31); (b) criticisms of Marxism Leninism's historical method (pp. 39-40, 63n., 86, 120 and 123); (c) criticism of the conception of man and society to be found in Soviet historical materialism (pp. 43, 58-9, 60, 98, 109, 277 and 373); and (d) finally, criticisms on various particular points such as: condemnation of the Soviet refusal to take psycho-analysis seriously (p. 47); an out and out destruction of Engels (p. 670); and indirect criticisms included in his notion of materialism (p. 131) and of the individual (pp. 432 and 543, among others). This is by no means a complete catalogue but it will serve to illustrate the thrust of Sartre's critique of Marxist idealism. (a) Sartre's social-political criticism of Soviet Marxism-Leninism is particularly devastating: "This means that the 'dictatorship of the prole tariat' was an optimistic notion, too hastily formulated because of lack of knowledge of the formal laws of dialectical Reason: first of all, there was a time when it was too early for the exercise of this dictatorship in the 130</page><page sequence="10">SARTRE AND THE OPACITY OF MARXISM-LENINISM USSR. The real dictatorship was that of a group which reproduced itself and which exercised its power - in the name of a mandate which the proletariat had not given it - over the bourgeoisie which was being liqui dated, over the peasantry, and over the working class itself. From the point of view of the masses, the sovereignty of this group was neither legitimate nor illegitimate: its practical legitimation came from the fact that the sovereign had constructed its illegitimacy by its faults and its crimes - this is the judgment of history. Today, it is too late and the real problem which poses itself is that of the withering away of the state in the name of groupings of ever-expanding, extero-conditioned serialities. The reason why the dictatorship of the proletariat (as the real exercise of power by the totalisation of the working class) never appeared is that the very idea is absurd, i.e., a bastardised compromise between the action group (which is sovereign) and passive serialit?" (pp. 629-630). In this and in similar passages Sartre simply documents the failure of Soviet Communism to live up to its supposedly Marxist origins. Despite the de-Stalinisation, this point of view is totally false for a historical materialism which prides itself in having invented the dictator ship of the proletariat as the natural expression of class-conflict during the take-over and consolidation of power. Sartre's mistake is due to his 'subjectivisation' of the working class and his ignorance of the role of the Communist Party as the vanguard thereof. (b) On the dialectical method of Marxism-Leninism, Sartre has the following to say: "This difficulty (on the relationship of being and truth, t.b.) seemed insurmountable to today's Marxists: they saw only one way to resolve it, viz., to refuse any dialectical activity to thought and to dissolve it in the universal dialectic: to suppress man by dissolving him into the universe. Thus they can substitute Being for Truth. There is no longer anything which is properly knowledge', Being no longer manifests itself in any form at all: it evolves according to its own laws; the dialectic of nature is nature without men. Therefore, there is no longer any need for certitude or criteria: it becomes useless to criticise and establish thought" (pp. 123-124). Of course, Sartre's criticism here touches on a fundamental point: he is accusing Marxism-Leninism of remaining at the level of a mechanistic materialism which precisely sacrifices the originality of human thought to a dialectically ordered universe, where man is but one material element among others. 131</page><page sequence="11">THOMAS J. BLAKELEY A good dialectical materialist would have to reply that Sartre obviously has not read even the most elementary Soviet texts. If he had he would have found 'the Leninist theory of reflection' which solves all of these problems by indicating that the 'subjective dialectic' reflects the 'objective dialectic' and that the two are 'dialectically related' in man. It is precisely Sartre who ruins the whole Marxist world-view by assimilating material reality to his neo-Hegelian 'dialectical reason'. For example, the synthesis of interiority and exteriority accomplished by the tiers is purely con ceptual: in fact, the interiority and exteriority themselves are purely con ceptual. Sartre can discredit Marxism-Leninism only by falling into pure subjectivism himself. (c) As Sartre sees it, Marxism-Leninism has totally forgotten man to the extent of being unable to deal with specifically human properties, especially goals: "One must resolutely reject the supposed 'positivism' which inspires the contemporary Marxist and which pushes him to deny the existence of these ultimate meanings. The supreme mystification of positivism is that it pretends to approach social experience without a priori, whereas it has decided from the beginning to deny one of its funda mental structures in order to replace it with another. It was legitimate for the natural sciences to free themselves from that anthropomorphism which involves attributing human properties to inanimate objects. But it is completely absurd to introduce the rejection of anthropomorphism into anthropology: when studying man what is more exact and strict than recognizing his human properties!" (p. 98). Sartre is a Don Quixote caught in his own windmill. Marxism-Leninism does recognize the human properties of man - not his subjective and alienated properties (like the soul and God), but his real, economic pro perties, viz. his work, his class-position, etc. Again Sartre would do well to abandon his subjectivist dialectic and to study some of the basic texts of Marxism-Leninism. (d) As to the particular criticisms, we will only briefly note that Sartre's reference to psycho-analysis has long been current among Western Marxists3 and is the type of thing which enrages the Soviets. The same is true of Sartre's attacks on Engels. He really pulls no punches ; and he must be aware that as the inventor of the dialectic of nature (and, therefore, Lenin's direct inspiration in his views on science) Engels is a sacred cow to the Soviets. 132</page><page sequence="12">SARTRE AND THE OPACITY OF MARXISM-LENINISM III. SOME SOVIETS AND SARTRE If we have taken the time to reproduce Sartre's criticisms of Marxism Leninism and to answer them ourselves from the point of view of doctri naire historical materialism, this is due to the fact that there is little Soviet comment. Although it has been almost seven years since the Critique was published, we could find only five articles which made any extensive mention of it - and four of these were in the same book. Before looking at the articles, here is the concluding paragraph of the article on Sartre in the Philosophical Encyclopedia: "The life and work of Sartre show how an error in the philosophical basis forms an obstacle to any effective po litical activity and condemns him to be only subjectively revolutionary as long as he does not re-examine his basic philosophical postulates."4 To look at the title of the first article, 'The Category of Social Being and the Method of its Analysis in the Existentialism of Sartre', by M. K. Mamardasvili5, one would expect to find the essential confronta tion between Sartre's 'Marxism' and that of Marxism-Leninism. Unfor tunately, such is not the case. Mamardasvili seems so overawed by the standard Soviet slogans on Sartre's 'mysticism', 'sensualism', etc., that he never gets around to seriously trying to see if the Sartre of the Critique is the same as the Sartre of L'?tre et le n?ant. Mamardasvili assumes that Sartre is the same old pessimist o? L'?tre et le n?ant: he therefore fails to seriously examine Sartre's methodological presuppositions, where he could have seriously criticised Sartre. He also fails to realize that the taking of 'lutte9 as a basic category in the Critique at least attenuates the despair and absurdity which reigned in Sartre's earlier work. Thus, Mamardasvili repeatedly mentions 'unhappy consciousness', a Sartrean term which I believe occurs only once, if at all, in the Critique. However, in his own rambling way, Mamardasvili does manage to put his finger on the two main objections which any Marxist-Leninist has to put to Sartre, i.e., the basic subjectivism of the Critique and the fact that the social whole is constructed ultimately on the individual. All in all, the article is unsatisfactory in that it does not meet the Sartrean challenge directly. But some progress is to be seen in the fact that Mamardasvili does not get around to calling Sartre a 'political opportunist' until near the end of the article! In the second article, 'Sartre's Negative Dialectic', B. E. Byxovskij6 133</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS J. BLAKELEY recognizes that the Critique marks a new stage in the development of Sartre and limits himself to a consideration of Sartre's notions on dialec tical theory and method. Byxovskij takes up the question of the dialectic of nature, coming to the defense of the beleaguered Engels. And he does it badly. First of all, he asks if it is not the case that the dialectic of nature has been verified by science. This is really no way to carry on a dialogue! In the second place, and more to the point, Byxovskij seems to have missed Sartre's point. Sartre does not reject the dialectic of nature as such: he rejects the premature dialectic of nature as fathered by Engels. Finally, Byxovskij reduces Sartre's opposing of history to nature to the opposi tion - in L'?tre et le n?ant - between l'en-soi and le pour-soi. Such an opposition may be there but Sartre does not use it to affirm an irreparable cleavage between nature and history: he wants the dialectic of nature put on the shelf until a viable anthropology clarifies the whole matter. Byxovskij next takes up Sartre's notions of freedom and necessity. However, he obviously does not understand that Sartre's freedom is human freedom and his necessity is human necessity. Again, we find the inability of the Marxist-Leninist to put the human being in the center of the picture : when the Marxist-Leninist says 'freedom' and 'necessity' he means some thing in the so-called 'objective world' : as Sartre points out, there is no place for man here except as another object among objects. In this con text, Byxovskij has the nerve to call Sartre a 'Machian pragmatist'. The accusation of 'subjective idealism of a pragmatist type' comes up again when Byxovskij discusses Sartre's notion of relation. The Soviet is correct when he sees that Sartre's relations are transcendental, whereas the Soviet relations are 'nowhere' if not in mechanical motion and local proximities. However, it is difficult to see where he gets the term 'pragma tist' for Sartre except that Sartre does use individual 'practice' as one of his basic categories. There is little reason to go on cataloguing Byxovskij's misunderstand ings: his worst error is to claim that Sartre's dialectical reason does not cover analysis: Sartre says the exact opposite in that analytical reason is assumed into and transcended by dialectical reason. Sartre's Critique also comes up for mention in the same volume in T. A. Saxarova's article, 'The Problem of Man in the Conceptions of the French Existentialists'.7 However, the author's misunderstanding of the Critique seems total. There is no understanding of Sartre's effort to find 134</page><page sequence="14">SARTRE AND THE OPACITY OF MARXISM-LENINISM an anthropology which bases social theory rather than one which is deduced therefrom. Sartre is accused of ignoring the role of work - which is ridiculous in the extreme. There can be no real end to this study as long as Soviet Marxist-Leninists fail to face up to the real problems and challenges posed by Sartre in his Critique de la Raison Dialectique. Thus far, as we have seen, they have met the challenge with what might be called 'schematisms of pure Marxist Leninist reason'.8 On the other hand, we have seen that the bases of Sartre's view are antithetical to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. To engage in a real dialogue with this wayward brother, the Soviets will have to show much more readiness than they hitherto have to envisage serious 'revisions' of their world-view. REFERENCES * In view of the fact that we are talking about existentialism here, 'viscosity' might have been a better term. However, 'opacity' seems to fit better the visual-linear nature of Marxism-Leninism. 1 Critique de la Raison Dialectique (pr?c?d? de Question de m?thode), Tome I : Th?orie des ensembles pratiques, Gallimard, Paris, 1960, 755 p. 2 Puzzlingly enough, one finds 'Question' in the singular on the cover and title-page but in the plural both in the Table of Contents and in Sartre's introduction. 3 Cf., for example, Reuben Osborn's Marxism and Psycho-analysis, Barrie &amp; RocklifF, London, 1965, 160 pp. 4 Filosofskaja enciklopedija.

There is an equally indecisive mention of Sartre's Critique in G.D. SuPzenko's 'Teorija poznanija francuzskogo ekzistencializma' [The Theory of Knowledge of French Exist entialism] in the same volume, where it is question of the 'subjectivism' of Sartre's view on knowledge. 8 G. Ja. Strel'cova has just published 'Evoljucija filosofskich vzgljadov 2.-P. Sartra' [The Evolution of the Philosophic Views of J.-P. Sartre] in VF 1968,3, 74-84, a short, objective and realistic appraisal of the Critique. Although the interpretation of the Critique basically agrees with that of our first section (the author talks of Sartre's "historical optimism" (p. 82) and sees Sartre as on his way "from existentialism to Marxism" (p. 84)), Strel'cova fails to see the Critique as a challenge to Marxism Leninism and, above all, seems to be 'waiting at the summit' for Sartre to reach the objective truth which the Soviets already possess. 135</page></plain_text>
