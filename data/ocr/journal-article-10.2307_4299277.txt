Coastal classification: Systematic approaches to consider in the development of a comprehensive system. Journal of Coastal Research, 20(1), 166-213. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Many different kinds of classification have been applied to coasts in attempts to characterize dominant features in terms of physical or biological properties, modes of evolution, or geographic occurrence. Some of the earlier general classifications were broad in scope but lacked specificity while other specialized systems were narrowly focused, providing uneven coverage of taxonomic units for coastlines of the world. Due to more comprehensive study of coasts and the increasing availability of information, especially digital formats in GIS frameworks, integrated and systematic approaches to coastal classification are favored. The complex demands of today require sophisticated solutions to overlapping and interrelated problems in the littoral, as facilitated by organization of biophysical parameters into a coherent whole or universal scheme. The developmental approach to a new comprehensive classification system is thus proposed for the coastal fringe, a swath zone 5 to 10 km wide across the shoreline, which incorporates all important parameters necessary to categorize geomorphic units that can be mapped at meaningful scales. Consider- ation of coastal geomorphological properties are the theme of this approximation toward a modern taxonomic system where morphostructures are the unifying links that facilitate transition from one hierarchical level to another. The proposed approach employs differentiating criteria for hard rock (automorphic) and soft rock (allomorphic) coasts which are divided by chronometric parameters related to the antiquity of littoral landforms. Other levels of primary differentia include geodynamic-climatomorphogenic process zones, relief types (morphoregions), morphogenetic relief features, and relief elements and genetically homogeneous surfaces. Morphotypes are lower level taxons that provide examples of ingressional, egressional, and complex process-forms. The proposal for a unified system requires testing in the field and mapping at myriametric scales to update subsequent approximations.

INTRODUCTION Since modern scientific investigations of the land-sea boundary began in the early 1800's, the classification and no- menclature of coasts has been somewhat problematic. Al- though there have been many attempts to solve the problem, no mutually satisfactory or complete solution has yet been found. This situation obtains because philosophies of coastal classification are guided by existing knowledge and prag- matic circumstances that seek to service an identifiable au- dience. The coastal zone is multipurpose and therefore its study is germane to several academic disciplines. No single classification can equally serve all who seek to study coastal features for their own special purposes. To a large degree, a classification system reflects the level of perception of re- search and understanding of natural bodies (morphological features) in terms of process and form. KUBIENA (1948) suc- cinctly emphasized this relationship to the soil science com- munity when he stated "Show me your [classification] system and I will tell you how far you have come in the perception of your research." Although this comment was made over a half-century ago to researchers in another discipline, the ob- servation is relevant to the coastal sciences toady. To a cer- tain extent, coastal researchers are still attempting to un- derstand processial relationships between form, function, time, and space in one of the most dynamic environments on earth. It is thus not surprising that terminologies, classifi- cations, and morphodynamic models are approximations of the moment. The present situation was, to a large degree, forecast by R. J. Russell in his remark, "Much of the litera- ture on sea coasts is concerned with classification of shoreline types, but to me this is both unfortunate and premature. Tax- onomy should follow, rather than precede, the acquisition of more precise and factual information than we now possess ... I think we know altogether too little about coasts to line up examples and shove them into appropriate pigeonholes" (RUSSELL, 1967, p. 84). Although still true in certain re- spects, coastal geomorphology has certainly advanced a long way down the road of understanding, especially in the areas of morphodynamics and modeling. The preceding comments relate conceptually to the big pic- 03-777A received and accepted in revisions 20 July 2003.</page><page sequence="2">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 167 ture, past and present, but there are also perceptual inequi- ties that are associated with definitions of 'coast' as an object of study, related to areal and temporal extents, but perhaps most problematic is the complex compounding of time- (in)dependent forms one upon another at all scales. It might be suggested, therefore, that coastal classifications are some- what enigmatic because most coasts are compound represen- tations of overlapping terrestrial, coastal, and marine pro- cesses that produce multifaceted, polygenetic features and forms on an inherited geologic framework. Coasts are also difficult to define because they represent spatially and tem- porally transient manifestations that are loci of unique as- semblages of erosional and depositional processes (e.g. Rus- SELL, 1958, 1967; SHEPARD and WANLESS, 1971; BLOOM, 1978). As SHERMAN and BAUER (1993) and SCHWARZER et al. (2003) emphasize, coastline evolution occurs over different time scales ranging from storm events to millennia and be- cause of the time-transgressing nature of coasts, different methods are used to study, describe, and classify sedimen- tological and morphological variations and changes. Thus, small- and large-scale coastal behavior (e.g. COWELL et al., 2004a, b) and morphological modeling and description depend largely on investigations from short events to long-term pro- cesses. An additional complicating factor is the interaction of effects of coastal processes that operate on different time scales (e.g. HANSON et al., 2004). There is thus a complicated mix of temporal and spatial scales of observation that re- quires a degree of cognizance prior to rationalization of coast- al morphologies at different scales. Coastline length also militates against comprehensive sys- tems that must incorporate great diversity over long distanc- es where similar kinds of coast (kind, sequence and arrange- ment of morphological features) transcend national borders, suggesting that such efforts must be international in scope. One way to perhaps appreciate the magnitude (scale) of the problem is to consider length of coastline for ocean margins (not including coastline lengths of islands, archipelagos, em- bayments, etc.): Arctic Ocean (126,347 km), Baltic Sea (11,939 km), Indian Ocean (75,873 km), Mediterranean Sea (52,977 km), North Atlantic Ocean (216,320 km), North Pa- cific Ocean (216,832 km), South Atlantic Ocean (16,931 km), South China Sea (63,024 km), Southern Ocean (17,968 km), and the South Pacific Ocean (56,827 km), for a total of 855,038 km. The length of coastline for the top ten countries and territories comes to 531,864 km accounting for 63% of the world's total viz Canada (243,791; 29%), Indonesia (54,716; 6.5%), Greenland (44,087; 5.2%), Russia (37,653; 4.5%), Philippines (36,289; 4.3%), Japan (29,751; 3.5%), Aus- tralia (25,760; 3%), Norway (21,925; 2.6%), United States (19,924; 2.4%), and Antarctica (17,968; 2.1%) (World Fact- book). Because coastal forms successively overprint younger mor- phologies and because there is a multiplicity of morphologies associated with ascending and descending coastlines (associ- ated with temporal fluctuations of sea level), no classification of coasts is widely accepted but some general morphological and tectono-morphological schemes are favored viz. SHEPARD (1973), INMAN and NORDSTROM (1971). There is a multiplic- ity of special purpose classification schemes for intrinsic properties of discrete landform systems such as dunes (e.g. COOPER, 1958; OLSEN, 1959; SHORT and HESP, 1982; NORDSTROM, 1990), spits and bars (EVANS, 1942); coral reefs (e.g. DARWIN, 1839, 1842; FAIRBRIDGE, 1950a, 1967; MAX- WELL, 1968; GUILCHER, 1988), beaches (e.g. WRIGHT and SHORT, 1984; MASSELINK and TURNER, 1999; SHORT, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1982, 1993, 1999), rocky cliffs and platforms (e.g. TRENHAILE, 1987; SUNAMURA, 1992), or coastal landscapes such as oceanic islands (e.g. NUNN, 1994), coastal scenery (e.g. ARBER, 1911), or even coastal forms related to levels of wave energy (e.g. TANNER, 1960b) etc. but comprehensive ap- proaches that organize individual landforms into a universal hierarchy are yet to be devised. In addition, numerous sys- tems have been developed for the ecological regionalization of coasts (e.g. BAILEY et al., 1994; BAILEY, 1998; DETHIER, 1992; GREENE et al., 1999; HAYDEN et al., 1984; UDVARDY, 1975; WIELAND, 1993) and in the last decade there has been a proliferation of classification systems that qualifies the need for habitat classification (e.g. MUMBY and HARBORNE, 1999; ROFF and TAYLOR, 2000). This need has, in fact, led conservation scientists and resource managers to develop dozens of classification systems that target various types of coastal systems, as described by MADDEN (2003). Whatever the system features, whether ecological regionalizing (ecore- gions, bioregions), classification of biota and habitats, coastal- marine systems, biogeography, or land systems, organization of physical (geomorphological) systems provides a framework or underpinning for other types of classifications. The pleth- ora of coastal classification systems heralds the desire to for- mulate a universal scheme for geological (geomorphological) zones (and features) that in turn can be used as underpin- nings to biologically-based systems via terrestrial forms and bottom types (sublittoral and submarine morphologies). Al- though physically based coastal forms are the subject of this paper, they are discussed in relation to other approaches as all efforts combine into a larger coherent whole where the sum is greater than any of its parts. Purpose This paper attempts to define a universal, catholic ap- proach to coastal classification, but the proposal is seen as an open-ended approximation that can be modified. The original purpose of the proposed classification system was to provide organization to a laundry list of coastal landforms that are likely to be encountered in amphibious landings anywhere in the world, as part of a U.S. Navy research project. Some sites were clearly unsuitable as landing zones and they needed to be identified just as clearly as sites that are suitable. The development of a coastal geomorphic site selection system (FINKL et al., 1997; YUHR et al., 1997), after an on-and-off gestation period of several years, now seems to have grown beyond what was initially perceived as a relatively special- ized but simple coastal classification system. The purpose is presently seen as an attempt to consider the development of a multipurpose, comprehensive, and unified classification system for coastal landforms. Strictly speaking, this proposal is not a 'new' classification per se but an approach to an amal- Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="3">168 Finkl gamation or re-organization that employs useful parts of pri- or efforts. Philosophical Background to Classification Because the nature of the problem requires careful consid- eration, it is appropriate to inquire into the objectives of coastal classifications and to examine some principles in- volved in their construction (see discussions by TANNER, 1960a; COOPER and MCLAUGHLIN, 1998; FAIRBRIDGE, 2004). Although these objectives and principles are often implicit, there has been some direct discussion and philosophical sum- mations of classificatory underpinnings of specialized schemes that organize coastal morphologies (e.g. GUILCHER, 1958, 1988; KING, 1966; DAVIES, 1964, 1973; BIRD, 1976; FITZGERALD and HETEREN, 1999). Inevitably and ultimately, however, the problem of classification in general entails the problem of terminology and nomenclature (e.g. FINKL, 1981). Scientific names denote a group or class of objects of concern into classes or categories to which names can be given. Thus, the first purpose of classification is to provide groupings with appropriate names that can substitute for a description of the objects that are classified. Only by use of specific names or categories can researchers communicate effectively. To be successful, therefore, a system of nomenclature and classifi- cation must have general agreement of those who have need of the system. According to MILL (2002, reprinted from 1843 edition), who discussed the logical bases and principles of the overall classification process, natural phenomena are classi- fied in order to: (1) Organize knowledge (thereby contributing to economy of thought) (2) Bring out and understand relationships among individ- uals and classes of the population being classified. (3) Remember properties of the objects classified. (4) Learn new relationships and principles in the population that is being classified. (5) Establish groups or subdivisions (classes) of the objects under study in a manner useful for practical, applied pur- poses in: a. Predicting their behavior. b. Identifying their best uses. c. Estimating their productivity. d. Providing objects or units for research and for extend- ing and extrapolating research results or our obser- vations. In general and rudimentary classifications, the system is arranged or structured so that it does some or all, of the above five functions. Classification for a specific, applied, practical purpose is referred to as a technical grouping. How- ever, in scientific activities knowledge is organized without reference to a specific, applied objective, so that the classifi- cation system is set up in such a way that each group has as many unique, natural properties as possible and its name and properties relate to it but separate it from all others. Such systems are commonly called scientific or natural clas- sifications. Stated another way, the purpose of a natural clas- sification is to bring out relationships of salient properties of the population being classified, without reference to any sin- gle specified and applied objective. In a natural classification, all attributes of a population are considered and those which have the greatest number of covariant or associated charac- teristics are selected to define and separate (MILL, 2002, re- printed from 1843 edition). It is often posited that precision in classification leads to precision in thought and is therefore of great value as a men- tal discipline. A classification embodies in shorthand form knowledge about a subject; the construction of a classification is thus an attempt to organize knowledge. In short, its second objective is the schematic representation of ideas or concepts. Coastal features, being objects of common experience and ob- servation, were subject to early classification efforts. With increasing sophistication of coastal research, greater knowl- edge about materials, processes and forms (coastal configu- ration, landform evolution, morphodynamics), the classifica- tions became broader in scope, more focused, and better or- ganized. Approaches to Coastal Classification There have been various attempts to classify coastal land- forms (including shores and shoreline features) but none were entirely successful (BIRD, 1976), for reasons already indicat- ed. Although many different schemes have been proposed, no completely satisfactory classification of coasts has yet been devised. This situation perhaps partly results from wide- spread beliefs in the superiority of genetic approaches over descriptive classifications, as reported by KING (1966). Part of the difficulty also stems from the fact that a genetic clas- sification can only be applied satisfactorily when the process- es of landform development are known. Other attempts to use particular types or associations of landforms as indicators of particular modes of origin frequently cause interpretive er- rors that are exposed by subsequent research. Previous investigations propose that several salient factors should be taken into account when devising a coastal classi- fication (cf KING, 1966; DAVIES, 1964, 1973; BIRD, 1976; FAIRBRIDGE, 1989): (1) the shape or form (morphology) of the land surface (above and below sea level), (2) the movement of sea level relative to the land and vice versa (e.g. change in relative sea level, RSL), (3) modifying effects of marine pro- cesses, (4) climatic influences on process and form, and (5) age and durability of coastal materials. Some of these factors have been used in various proposed classifications. An addi- tional factor that must be considered is the scale of obser- vation (e.g. SHERMAN and BAUER, 1993), a parameter that is often implied but not explicitly indicated. A range of spatial scales determine the kinds of features, materials, or process- es that can be seen in the field, on maps, and from photo- graphs or satellite images. For the sake of the following dis- cussion, the range of scales in common usage include: global (worldwide coverage), continental, regional, and local (de- tailed). The general categories of phenomena that are studied in coastal classification can be grouped in terms of (1) pro- cesses, (2) materials, (3) forms, (4) age or stage of develop- ment, and (5) environments (e.g. ecological regions, land sys- tems, morphodynamic zones). Most systems focus on one or Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="4">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 169 two of these categories and are thus specialized rather than comprehensive. PROCESS-RELATED COASTAL CLASSIFICATIONS Due to the complexity of coasts, numerous attempts to or- ganize coastal features or processes have been put forward but no single system of classification has been comprehensive in scope or coverage. The following summation groups the main kinds of coastal classification that have been attempted so far. Most of these preliminary systems were genetic in ap- proach, global in scope, but often of limited perspective. The following brief review, for convenience, groups some of the better known schemes into the following categories of clas- sification: (1) geotectonic systems (geodynamic processes), (2) sea-level change (eustatic processes), (3) marine modification and terrestrial inheritance, and (4) coastal erosion (shoreline retreat) and deposition (shoreline advance). It is noted that most coastal classification systems overlap in certain ways and are not mutually exclusionary. They also tended to adopt the dogma of the times and thus to some extent they are records of conventional wisdom at select points in history. Coastal Geotectonic Provinces Early attempts at classification of coasts were general but not necessarily comprehensive systems that were intended for application over broad areas from regional to global scales. One of the earlier attempts was made by SUESS (1888), almost incidentally, when he proposed in his book The Face of the Earth, the now well-known geotectonic classifica- tion of "Atlantic" and "Pacific" coasts. Resulting from differ- ent tectonic styles, these two broad types of coast were seen to have distinctive characteristics that are still recognized to- day in the framework of plate tectonics and continental drift. In Atlantic type (transverse) coasts, the general trend of tec- tonic structures strike the coastal margin at right angles. Most plate-imbedded, or trailing edge coasts, which corre- spond to Suess's Atlantic-type coasts, have hilly, plateau, or low hinterlands, and wide continental shelves. The structural lineations of these coasts are discordant with the shore. In general, Atlantic-type coasts tend to be indented, partly re- sulting from lines of structural weakness and exposure of rocks of variable resistance to wave erosion, as seen in the example of a rocky coast near Halifax, Nova Scotia (Figure 1). In the Pacific (longitudinal) type coasts, structural lines (geologic grain) parallel the coast. Pacific-type coasts tend to be fairly straight and regular in planform, with few inden- tations where rivers have broken through resistant strata to expose weaker inland materials. There may be a flight of raised terraces on the steep, tectonically unstable mobile hin- terland, which is an abundant source of coastal sediment. Al- though the structural dichotomy is much generalized, it can be applied in a broad sense to the hinterland of most coasts. They are high, straight coasts with narrow continental shelves, as seen for example along the Pacific Coast of Mexico near Manzonillo (Figure 2). A different dichotomy (an alternative to classification of coasts into Atlantic and Pacific types), although this desig- nation is useful and deployed in other schemes (e.g. INMAN and NORDSTROM, 1971), was proposed by COTTON (1918, 1925) where there were two major divisions between coasts of stable regions and those of mobile regions (Table 1). Sub- merging and emergent coasts occupied a lower second level in the scheme. Cotton's classification considers aspects of structural (tectonic) stability of the land surface and related changes in relative sea level. Many of Cotton's examples are taken from New Zealand which is affected by earth move- ments along parts of its coast. KING (1966) suggests that Cot- ton's classification could be considered partly as a sub-divi- sion of the all-embracing compound group of JOHNSON (1919). Thus, it is suggested that the last major change in base level (i.e. the grand base level in a geomorphological sense, mean sea level) is the most important in defining the types of coasts which may be combined with other features, such as faulting or flexure, to give different categories of coast. BIRD (1969) indicates that Cotton's system is most useful as a clarification of Johnson's scheme, the analysis of submergence and emer- gence enabling certain types of compound coast to be sepa- rated. Building on Suess's lead more than a century earlier, FAIR- BRIDGE (1992) discussed the regional aspects of Holocene coastal paleogeography of the United States and suggested that there are two basic categories of environmental setting that are of overriding importance: primarily, the geotectonic province and secondarily, the climatic province. He broadly defined seven main geotectonic provinces as: (1) active (con- vergent) plate margins and back-arc basins (Subduction Coasts), (2) taphrogenic (mainly strike-slip) plate margins (Taphrogenic Coasts), (3) passive plate margins (beyond gla- cial forebulge) associated with thick geosynclinal sedimen- tary sequences (Sedimentary Coasts), (4) passive plate mar- gins (with former glacial forebulge), also with thick sedimen- tary sequences, (5) active plate margins and back-arc basins (within former glacial loading and forebulge areas), (6) semi- stable platforms, dominated today by wind and meteorologi- cal tides and by geostrophic current dynamics, and (7) oceanic fracture-zone volcanic complexes and seamount-related atolls. Superimposed on these seven structurally dependent foun- dations are the latitudinally related regional-scale climatic provinces that often appear to play a dominant role on a short-term basis. FAIRBRIDGE (1992) designated the climatic provinces, with some generalization, as follows: (1) high Arc- tic, (2) Sub-Arctic, (3) west-coast westerly, (4) east-coast west- erly, (5) subtropical and trade wind. By linking geotectonic and climatic provinces, Fairbridge provided a useful means for describing broad coastal characteristics that are now com- prehended in an updated reformulation (FAIRBRIDGE, 2004) that is much more complete and globally comprehensive. Classifications Based on Changes in Relative Sea Level Rather than being based on tectonics or structure, other earlier classifications of coasts emphasized relative move- ments of land (geodynamic processes) and sea (eustatic pro- cesses), giving the main coastal groups as those dependent on relative submergence or emergence.

The sedimentary strata dipping seaward show little modification by marine processes, except for the formation of structurally controlled platforms that have formed along unconformities. Note the presence of re-entrants where weaker beds have eroded away allowing ingression of the sea. [Classification (Hectometric scale): Automorphic rocky intertidal coast] searchers to recognize the influence of submergence on the coastal outline was DANA (1849), who reported that the deep- ly embayed coast of Tahiti was the result of a rise in sea level which drowned coastal valleys to form deep inlets. The part played by marine modification was not explicitly formalized by DAVIS (1898) in his classification due to his emphasis on the cyclicity of marine erosion. In that system, sequential stages of coastal types were deduced as having resulted from a cyclic progression of landform evolution. DAVIS (1898) and GULLIVER (1889) both used the distinction between submer- gence and emergence as the basis of their coastal classifica- tions, although SUESS (1888) and RICHTHOFEN (1886) had also considered submergence and emergence criteria in coast- al description. DALY'S (1926, 1934, 1938) work on the glacial control of sea level, in relation to the formation of coral atolls and other features, drew attention to oscillations of sea level resulting from glacial-interglacial cycles. Perhaps one of the better known early coastal classifica- tions is the one proposed by JOHNSON (1919), a scheme that is often appreciated as a classification of coasts, rather than of individual coastal types. Enlarging the previous dichotomy of coastal types put forward by other workers, Johnson re- tained two major groups, coastlines of submergence and emergence, but added neutral and compound coasts (Table 2). Neutral coasts included those which were not mainly due to submergence and emergence such as delta shorelines, al- luvial and outwash plains, and fault shorelines. Compound shorelines showed features of two or more of the other three main categories. Johnson's main coastal types are subdivided to give the classification outlined in Table 2. This classifica- tion has the advantage of being based on genetic interpreta- tions but, when strictly applied, many coasts fit into the com- pound category. Recent research shows that very few coastal areas have not been affected by sea-level change as a result of glacial control (e.g. VALENTIN, 1952; BLOOM, 1978, 1983; FAIRBRIDGE, 1950b, 1992). Relative sea-level change is also related to tectonic movements and other crustal instabilities such as isostatic rebound, diastrophism, and orogenic move- ment. KING (1966) points out that perhaps the least satisfac- tory group in Johnson's classification is the last category of compound coasts. In the emergent category, Johnson recog- nizes only the emergence of a very flat gradient seafloor Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="6">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 171 Figure 2.

This classification (Ta- ble 3) is somewhat comprehensive and has much to recom- mend it; however, the lack of a category for emergent coasts, as noted by COTTON (1954), is an obvious disadvantage. Some workers also refer to perceived difficulty in the application of this coastal classification to actual examples. This observa- tion is, however, common to most coastal classification sys- tems for reasons already discussed here. KING (1966), for ex- ample, asks the question, "How does one determine the pre- cise moment when a coast is sufficiently altered by marine agencies to allow it to be classified in the second major group?" The classification also cuts across the commonly used system of cyclic description. Coasts can be described in terms of the state of development by marine processes, from an ini- tial form which is defined in the classification. This new clas- sification uses what would normally be considered as the youthful stage of development as the second group of the clas- sification, so that a coast which is put into the second group automatically loses any reference to its initial form at the beginning of the cycle, which is running its course at the pre- sent time (BIRD, 1976). Shepard modified and elaborated his classification in 1973, but retained its basic structure. Table 4.

Coasts of retrogression (Coasts eroded back to a continuous line of cliffs, provided by reversal process has not caused deposition in front of the cliff.) 1 Features can only be placed in Category I if simultaneous subsidence does not counteract the effect of outbuilding The way in which base level varies through time is crucial to the problem of coastal classification, as it is to the whole concept of a marine cycle of erosion. The fundamental dis- tinction of process here is between advancing and retreating coasts, noting that advance may be due to coastal emergence and/or progradation by deposition, while retreat is due to coastal submergence and/or retrogradation by erosion. The concept of a changing base level consisting of periods of rapid change alternating with periods of stillstand forms the basis of VALENTIN's (1952) classification (Table 4). This system was devised for use on a map scale (1:50,000,000) of global coastal configurations. The emphasis in this classification is on tem- poral change. This system features present coastal change rather than the initial form of the coast before modification by marine processes. An important aspect of this classifica- tion is the recognition that marine forces are continually ac- tive and influence the coast even during changes in base level which should, on the basis of the older classifications, initiate a new cycle of erosion on a new coastal type (BIRD, 1976). According to VALENTIN (1952), the possibility is left open that changes of base level are continually operating and that still- stands are the exception rather than the rule. Valentin's clas- sification is expressed graphically by means of a diagram on which each of four axes represents one of four possibilities, coastal erosion and submergence on the negative side and coastal outbuilding and emergence on the positive side. This classification does not specifically consider coastal morphol- ogy nor provide groupings of coastal features in a hierarchical system. Nevertheless, it does provide a rudimentary yet use- Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="8">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 173 ful frame of reference for conceptualization of the basic role of coastal advance and retreat. SPECIAL PURPOSE COASTAL CLASSIFICATIONS In addition to genetic and descriptive approaches to coastal classification, there are practical attempts to map coastal fea- tures in relation to some specified purpose. Although not in- tended to be coastal classifications per se, the map units often provide a useful list of "what is" along the coast (see, for ex- ample environmental sensitivity index units used by GI- BEAUT and GUNDLACH, 1990). The sensitivity of coasts to oil spills, for example, provides the impetus to map coastal fea- tures along tanker routes in many regions. Summarized be- low are two examples, one from a cold region in Canada and the other from a subtropical zone in Florida. Both examples illustrate a potential for classification and the incorporation of mapping units in a relational geomorphological database. The cold-region example from Canada is especially important because the length of coastline (243,791 km, including 52,455 islands) comprises about 29% of the world's coastline (World Facts and Figures and CIA World Factbook). The subtropical Florida Atlantic shore, by way of a small-scale comparison, has only 933 km of seacoast based on measurements made with unit a measure of 30 minutes of latitude at a scale of 1: 1,200,000 or 5630 km of tidal shoreline (based on largest- scale maps and charts available to head of tidewater or to a point where waters narrow to 30 m). The tidal shoreline is longer because it includes total shoreline length viz. outer seacoast, barrier islands, sounds, bays, estuaries, and tidal rivers. Coastal morphologic units in the Florida example are thus much more detailed than those in the Canadian over- view. Regional or Reconnaissance Classification of Cold Region Coasts in Canada for Sensitivity to Oil Spill Clean-up The factors that control coastal variability, both in time and space, are outlined by OWENS (1994) as part of an effort to control the fate of spilled oil that reaches the coast. This specialized classification (Table 5) is considered within a framework or context of individual sections of shoreline that have been identified and mapped from regional surveys. The character of a coast is a function of the existing ma- terials and the processes acting upon those materials. There is a primary distinction between coasts that have sediment in the shore zone and those that do not. In the former case, the primary distinguishing feature between shoreline types is the size of the materials and the presence of vegetation (Table 5). On coasts without sediments, the type of material is the defining shoreline type. Coasts that are entirely with- out sediment are rare, and many rock cliffs or platforms have pockets of sand or pebbles. The character of the shoreline can be described by the form that results from marine and coastal processes that act on the various materials (Table 5). This approach is rudimentary because many coasts are combina- tions of one or more basic types. The system is also scale dependent showing only broadly defined units at the regional level. Table 5.

This kind of shoreline classification is less easily incorporated in a geo- morphological classification system. The mapping units do, however, provide information that can be interpreted and re- grouped into units more compatible with geomorphological terminology. This kind of information is now updated by the Florida Marine Research Institute (St. Petersburg, Florida). Environmental Sensitivity Index Mapping The most widely used approach in the United States, NOAA's Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI), systemati- cally compiles information for coastal shoreline sensitivity, Table 7. A genetic classification of oceanic islands. (After Nunn, 1994). Level One Level Two Plate Boundary Islands Islands at divergent plate boundaries Islands at convergent plate boundaries Islands along transverse plate boundaries Intraplate Islands Linear groups of islands Isolated islands Clustered groups of islands biological resources, and human-use resources. ESI maps identify sensitive resources before an oil spill occurs so that protection strategies and clean-up procedures can be de- signed in advance. ESI maps include geomorphological clas- sification of shoreline types that are integrated with other coastal resources (BATTISTA and MONACO, 1996) that help define risk during oil spills. These kinds of maps are compiled into atlases that are available for coastal states (including the Great Lakes) in paper and digital formats. The usefulness of these maps is that they provide a standardized approach for coastal geomorphological mapping, including color schemes and symbolization for coastal habitats. Classification of Oceanic Islands, Exclusive of Coral Reefs The classification of oceanic islands has always challenged attempts to summarize and group islands according to orga- nizing parameters. As NUNN (1994) points out, in order for a classification of islands to be practical, its purpose and level of generalization must be identified before differentiating characteristics can be selected. Because no single classifica- tion of islands meets the requirements of every specialist pur- pose, none of the attempts to produce a unifying or natural classification of islands provides a suitable basis for general and detailed investigation. Of the numerous island classifi- cations produced for educational purposes, most have ante- cedents in the seminal works of DARWIN (1842) and WAL- LACE (1881). Both of their approaches are uncomplicated and intended to be of wide utility. Previous attempts have focused on descriptions of island composition (limestone, basaltic vs. andesitic volcanic islands), geographic occurrence, nature of the underlying lithosphere (oceanic, continental, intermedi- ate) (see discussion in NUNN, 1994). Nunn uses a general genetic classification of oceanic islands based on the location of an island relative to particular physical elements of the earth's lithosphere (plate boundaries). Thus, the distinction drawn between plate-boundary and intraplate (mid-plate) is- lands forms a high level dichotomy in NUNN's (1994) scheme (Table 7). Coral reefs are frequently associated with oceanic islands, particularly those of volcanic origin. The model proposed by ScoTT and ROTONDO (1983) explains the origins of all major types of island found on the Pacific lithospheric plate where tens of thousands of seamounts are scattered over the oceanic crust of the plate surface. Because most of these igneous, sub- merged monoliths never reached the ocean surface, they are Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="10">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 175 Table 8.

Irregular uplift may preserve terraces protected from modifications induced by subaerial weather- ing and erosion. Back in 1842 Darwin proposed the elegant explanation that coral atolls resulted from the slow submer- gence of volcanic islands. His ideas were contested and went unproved until 1951 when drilling through the carbonate platform on Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands encountered volcanic basement rock at depths about 1200 m (LADD, 1973). Despite Darwin's early linkage of intraplate volcanoes to atolls, it was not until the mid 1900's that researchers fo- cused more critical attention on the interwoven histories, building on the work of WIENS (1962) and SCOTT and Ro- TONDO (1983) to differentiate eleven distinct island types (Table 8). Precursors of island types on the Pacific plate are volcanic islands with no (or incomplete) fringing reef. All oth- er types then depend on the development of a fringing reef and then some degree of subsidence or emergence or some combination of the two. Although many names have been used in reference to island types and specific atolls, these categories provide an indication of important types. The sub- division of coral reefs into distinct categories is thus consid- ered in the following section. Classification of Coral Reefs and Reef Islands Following the extremely broad and laconic classification of DARWIN (1842), coral reefs are still divided into three main types: fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. Within each class of reef there is much morphological diversity and this is particularly true of the reefs of continental shelves which fall generally within the barrier reef division of Darwin. Two significant attempts have been made to produce a genetic Table 9. Classification of shelf coral reefs and associated geomorphic features. Reef Type Description Juvenile Stage of Development I. Unmodified Antecedent All reefs must go through this stage dur- Platform Reef ing their initial development. Relief re- flects the antecedent platform topogra- phy and may include mesoscale karst features. Soil and regolith formed dur- ing subaerial exposure will be removed. II. Submerged Shoal Reefs Relief enhancement commences as the reef accretes at its maximum rate. III. Irregular Patch Reefs Occurs when the reef reaches modern sea level and begins development of reef flat very irregularly. Mature Stage of Development IV. Crescentic Reefs Coalescence of initial reef patches to form the first hard-line margin to the reef. Lateral movement of sediment forms a prograding sand wedge into the central reef area. V. Lagoonal Reefs Closing of the reef flat around the mar- ginal rim on the leeward side creates a lagoonal reef. Senile Stage of Development VI. Planar Reefs Final choking of lagoons takes place with complete sediment infill and merging of patch reefs. Terms and descriptions summarized from Hopley (1988) classification of these reefs. An initial classification by FAIR- BRIDGE (1950, 1967) was elaborated by MAXWELL (1968), al- though both classifications were based on the premise of Ho- locene origin for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia). In broad outline, if not in detail, their progressive development of reef forms with time is similar to HOPLEY's (1982) proposal for Quaternary development of GBR coral reefs. GUILCHER (1988) additionally considers bank reefs and patch reefs to be special types. Based on criteria considered by previous workers, HOPLEY (1988) developed a classification of shelf reefs (Table 9). The basic classification emphasizes small to medium-sized reefs that grow from antecedent platforms with single depressions in the diameter range of 1.75-3.25 km. Smaller reefs, where antecedent surfaces lack a protolagoonal relief, but because the width of reef flat initially developed around the reefal margins occupy such a high proportion of the total reef area, any lagoon that forms will be shallow and quickly filled. The mature phases will be either bypassed or persist for a very short period. In contrast, the largest reefs will remain in ma- ture stages for long periods because of the low ratio of pro- ductive margin to lagoon area. A major subgroup is ribbon reefs which grow from linear foundations that are either discrete antecedent platforms or high rims on much larger and usually deeper platforms. The basic feature is depth of water behind the narrow reef flat that develops from the foundations. Although sediment move- ment is to leeward, accretion is very slow and widening of the reef flat is retarded.

Mangrove cays III. Multiple Islands IV. Complex Low Wooded Islands ribbon reef can be equated with those in the basic classifi- cation. Reviewing literature on reef islands, STODDART and STEERS (1977) suggest that cays and low wooded islands of the GBR show greater morphological variety than reef is- lands of any other coral reef region. Forms range from small ephemeral sand patches emerging only at low water to the complex low wooded islands consisting of leeward sand cay, windward shingle island cemented with rampart rocks, and central mangrove swamp. In the division of island types de- scribed by HOPLEY (1988), the numbers of islands on reef tops, their degree of complexity, and the overall morphology in relation to the presence or absence of centripetal processes, are used as additional differentiating factors (Table 10). GUILCHER (1988) proposes a slightly different classification of reef types which are summarized in Table 11. In addition to the classification of reef types, Guilcher discusses many kinds of surface features that are associated with coral reefs. Classification of Beaches and Beach Geomorphology Sandy coasts, which constitute about 20% of the world's coastline, occur juxtaposed to muddy and rocky shores. The term beach is traditionally applied to a 'shore with a cover of sand or shingle' (SHEPARD, 1973). Although most classifica- tions deal with sandy beaches (see following discussion), shin- gle or gravel beaches (e.g. CARTER and ORFORD, 1984; WELLS, 1996) represent coarse-grained end members that are related to morphodynamic properties that are distinct from fine-grained counterparts. JENNINGS and SHULMEIS- TER (2002), for example, consider the Iribarren number, beach width, average grain size, and storm berm height as discriminating factors in the classification of gravel beaches. For sandy beaches, the orthogonal system of classification ex- tends from the landward limit of the swash to the depth at which wave action ceases to be competent to transport non- cohesive seabed sediment (HARDISTY, 1990). Usage of the or- thogonal system encompasses the term shoreface. Although no permanent lines can be drawn for the boundaries of the orthogonal system because both the landward and seawards limits will move continually under changing wave and tidal Table 11.

Beaches exhibit a more or less smooth profile which is con- cave upwards and has a more or less straight or gently curved plan shape (RUSSELL, 1958). This worldwide uniformity of form suggests the action of common processes and it is their identification and analysis that leads to an understanding of the general features of beaches (HARDISTY, 1990). These gen- eral features are referred to as first order forms. The shape of the beach profile is generally due to orthogonal processes, those which operate along a vertical plane in the direction of wave advance (diabathic transport), which is roughly shore normal, while the plan shape of the beach is due to longshore processes which operate in a shore-parallel or coastwise (par- abathic) direction. First order forms often have superimposed on them smaller scale second order features (Table 12). If the beach is exam- ined in finer detail, then third order forms are revealed which range from wave generated ripples, swash and backwash marks, and drainage channels to the individual grains and internal bedding structures which constitute the fabric of the beach deposit. Second and third order forms are the product of local beach conditions. Wave-Dominated Beach Types The term beach type refers (according to SHORT, 1975, 1993) to the prevailing nature of a beach, including the waves and currents, the extent of the nearshore zone, the width and shape of the surf zone including its bars and troughs, and the dry or subaerial beach. The first comprehensive classification of beach types (morphodynamic states) (SHORT, 1975) and change was developed by the Coastal Studies Unit at the Uni- versity of Sydney (New South Wales, Australia) in the 1970's and subsequently modified by WRIGHT and SHORT (1984) and Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="12">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 177 Table 12. Glossary of examples for second order beach features. Form or Feature SNP SPP Definition Backshore X The zone of the beach lying between the berm crest and the dune, bluff or cliff. Bar (longshore bar, ball or ridge) X An elongate, slightly submerged sand ridge or ridges which may be exposed at low water. Barrier X A sand beach (barrier beach), island (barrier island), or spit (barrier spit) that ex- tends roughly parallel with the general coastal trend but is separated from the mainland by a relatively narrow body of water or marsh. Beach face X Berm crest to low tide waterline, swash zone (morphological term); steeper reflec- tive part of upper beach profile above MSL and typically surmounting the berm. On estuarine beaches, the beach face is adjacent to the MHWM, is planar, and slopes relatively steeply to a broad tidal flat. Beach ridge (storm beach, chenier) X A low lengthy ridge of coarser beach materials (gravels, shells) piled up by storm waves landward of the berm. Berm X The nearly horizontal part of the beach landwards of the sloping foreshore. Accre- tionary berms have a steep beach face (8-14 degrees) rising to a distinct ridge and a gentle backslope of about 4 degrees. Erosional berms have no clear bound- ary with the beach face. Berm crest X The seaward limit of the berm; break in slope between berm riser (beach face) and berm tread, terrace. Cusps X A series of arcuate scallops with adjacent horns on the beach face extending nor- mal to the shoreline and recurring at more or less rhythmic intervals. Foreshore X The sloping part of the beach between the berm and the low water line (swash plus inner surf zone). Low tide terrace X An alongshore bar attached to the beach face that becomes a terrace at low water. Offshore X The zone seawards of the low tide mark. Rip channel X X Channel cut by seawards flow of rip currents which usually crosses the longshore bar. Shoreface X X Low water line to flatter slope of continental shelf. Trough (longshore trough, runnel, low) X Elongate depressions or series of depressions along the lower beach or in the off- shore zone which may be exposed at low water. Notes: SNP = Shore Normal Processes, SPP = Shore Parallel Processes. Although terms and definitions differ somewhat depending on points of view (e.g. morphology, hydrodynamics), these are meant to be illustrative of guidance based on Shepard (1973), Schwartz (1982), Short (1999), and EM 1110- 2-1810 (31 Jan 95) SHORT (1993). This classification, which is used internation- ally where the tide range is less than 2 m (microtidal range), recognizes three main beach types: dissipative, intermediate, and reflective (Table 13). The system, as applied to the east coast of Florida (BENEDET and FINKL, 2003; BENEDET et al., 2004a, b), shows a predominance of dissipative beaches north of the Cape Canaveral cuspate foreland but intermediate morphodynamic states occur south of the Cape foreland where beaches are characteristically single or double barred, with a well developed berm and rhythmic features (beach cusps) associated with rip currents. Reflective beach morpho- Table 13. Classification of morphodynamic beach types, based on the pre- vailing nature of a beach, including the waves and currents, extent of the nearshore zone, width and shape of the surf zone with its bars and troughs, and the dry subserial beach. This comprehensive classification of wave- dominated, micro-tidal beach types, first developed for the New South Wales coast, is now used worldwide where the tidal range is less than 2 m. (After Wright et al., 1982; Short, 1993, 1999). Wave-Dominated, Micro-Tidal, Beach Types Dissipative Intermediate Longshore Bar-Trough Rhythmic Bar and Beach (Normal or skewed) Transverse Bar and Rip (Normal or skewed) Ridge-Runnel or Low Tide Terrace Reflective types occur exclusively downdrift of inlets in wave shadows induced by jetties (BENEDET et al., 2004b). Reflective Beaches These beaches are characterized by steep, narrow beaches usually composed of coarser sand and lower waves. Almost all beaches composed of gravel, cobble and boulders are al- ways reflective, no matter what the wave height. These beaches have a steep, narrow beach and swash zone and beach cusps are commonly present on the upper beach face (Figures 3 and 4). The pocket beach near Halifax, Nova Scotia (Figure 3), contains cobble-sized clasts that can range up to 30 cm in diameter. At the lower end of the particle-saize scale are reflective sandy beaches such as the one at Taquarinhas Beach on the southeast coast of Brazil (Figure 4). Most re- flective beaches containing a range of sand sizes have what is called a beach step. The step is always located at the base of the beach face around the low water mark. It consists of a band containing the coarsest material available including rocks, cobbles, boulders and shells. Most steps average a few decimeters in height but some may reach a maximum of per- haps a meter. Immediately seaward of the step the sediments usually fine markedly and assume a lower slope. Intermediate Beaches These beach types are intermediate between the lower en- ergy reflective beaches and the highest energy beaches called Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="13">178 Finkl Figure 3.

This particular beach contains coarse siliciclastic sand (average mean grain size is 0.8 mm on the beachface) and nonbarred, steep profiles typical of reflective beaches.

A characteristic feature of intermediate beaches is the presence of a surf zone with bars and rips. Intermediate beaches are commonly classified into four beach states. The lowest energy one is called 'low tide terrace,' then as waves increase the 'transverse bar and rip,' then the 'rhythmic bar and beach,' and finally the 'longshore bar and trough' (SHORT, 1993, 1999). Low tide terrace (LTT) beaches tend to occur where sand is fine to medium grained and wave heights average between 0.5 and 1 m. These beaches are found toward the lower en- ergy, more protected end of long beaches, in moderately pro- tected embayments, and in more exposed locations where sand is coarse grained. LTT beaches are characterized by a moderately steep beach face, which is joined at the low tide level to an attached bar or terrace, hence the name low tide terrace. Bars usually extend 20 to 50 m seaward and continue alongshore attached to the beach. The bars may be flat and featureless; have a slight central crest, called a ridge; and may be cut every several meters by small shallow rip chan- nels called mini rips. Transverse bar and rip (TBR) beaches occur where sand is generally fine to medium grained and waves average 1 to 1.5 m. These beaches are thus named in reference to bars that are transverse or perpendicular to and attached to the beach, separated by deeper rip channels. The bars and rip channels are usually regularly spaced every 150 to 250 m, but can reach spacing of 500 m. Their surf zone ranges from 50 to 100 m wide. The longshore variation in wave breaking and swash causes the beach to be reworked such that slight ero- sion usually occurs in the lee of rips, and slight deposition in the lee of bars. This pattern results in a rhythmic shoreline where the undulations are called megacusp horns (behind the bars) and embayments (behind the rips). The rhythmic bar and beach (RBB) types are associated with dissipative to intermediate the energy states. These beaches are mostly associated with medium-grained sand, but RBB morphotypes may occur where the sand is finer than medium and where waves occur in the general range of 0.5 m as seen, for example, in Florida (BENEDET et al., 2004a). The RBB type has much in common with the transverse type except that waves are usually higher and the bars are de- tached from the beach. As the name implies both the surf zone and bar are rhythmic as they weave between rips and bars, and the beach is rhythmic as it weaves between me- gacusp horns and embayments, as described for the trans- verse beach type. The longshore bar and trough (LBT) beach type is charac- terized by waves averaging 1.5 m or more, which break over a near continuous longshore bar located between 100 and 150 m seaward of the beach, with a 50 to 100 m wide 2 to 3 m deep longshore trough separating it from the beach. The beach face, unlike the transverse and rhythmic beaches, is straight alongshore and usually has a lower gradient. Dissipative Beaches When dissipative beaches occur, the combination of high waves and fine sand ensures that they have wide surf zones and usually two or three shore parallel bars, separated by subdued troughs. The wide beach with no distinct berm shown in Figure 5, Balnetirio Camboriui Beach (Santa Catar- ine State, Brazil), is characteristic of many dissipative mor- photypes. The beach face is composed of fine sand, and al- ways wide, low and firm enough to support a 2 WD car. Wave breaking begins as high spilling breakers on the outer bar, which reform to break again and perhaps again on the inner bar or bars. In this way they dissipate their energy across the surf zone which may be up to 300 to 500 m wide. This is the origin of the name 'dissipative.' Beaches not in present contact with the contemporary coastal regime are referred to as relict or carry a paleo epithet to designate their morphodynamic status in stasis. Progra- dation of the coast may leave older beaches stranded behind younger ones, for example, as beach-ridge plains. Uplift along neotectonic coasts is another example where the nexus with the present coast is broken and beaches become elevationally stranded by uplift or downfaulting (drowning). There are many mechanisms of stranding and different forms result (see discussions, for example, in TAYLOR and STONE, 1996). Tide-Dominate Beach Types Although dissipation of incident wave energy is the most important process that affects the morphology and hydrody- namics of beach environments, the degree to which tide-re- lated processes effect coastal morphodyanics increases with tidal range. Distinctive beach morphotypes can be recognized because (1) the tidal stage determines where certain near- shore processes operate on the shore profile and (2) the tidal translation rate determiones how long processes act on the bed and affect beach morphology (MASSELINK and TURNER, 1999). Consideration of tidal cycles (amplitude and duration) adds another level of complexity to beach morphodynamics where beach morphotypes can be differentiated on the basis of breaking wave height and period, the high tide sediment fall velocity, and the mean spring tide range. These four mor- phodynamic variables were used by MASSELINK and SHORT (1993) to develop a beach morphodynamic classification scheme that incorporates tidal effects. This system recognizes the following main morphotypes: reflective (reflective beach- face and reflective high tide beach-dissipative low tide ter- race), intermediate (barred: steep beachface with pronounced deep trough, steep beachface with subdued bar morphology, and steeper beachface with low tide transverse bar and rip morphology), and dissipative (barred dissipative and ultra dissipative). The example of a tide-dominated reflective beach on San Salvador Island, Bahamian Archipelago (Figure 6), contains beach rock on the upper beach profile and a low tide terrace. Classification of Coastal Dune Morphology There are no major classifications of coastal dunes per se. Until very recently, there was a tendency to rely on the sem- inal contributions of BAGNOLD (1941) together with a small collection of widely cited papers-for example LANDSBERG (1956), COOPER (1958), and OLSEN (1958). Many of the ear- lier investigators did not attempt to identify the differences between coastal and interior dunes.

Balneairio Camboriti Beach (Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil) during low tide. This wide flat beach is characteristic of dissipative states in the morphodynamic classification of beaches, as defined by SHORT (1999), with an average beachface siliciclastic grain size of about 0.20 mm. Note the low gradient of the beachface, lack of a berm, and compacted fine-grained sand that formed ripples during high tide. [Classification (Decametric scale): Scoliomorphogenic dissipative morphotype on a mature or subsiding coast] cess-based studies of coastal dunes (Figure 7) have begun to revise and even question many long-held views (see, for ex- ample, SHERMAN and HOTTA, 1990) and there is a noticeable shift towards exploring the morphodynamic status of dunes (SHORT and HESP, 1982). Recent advances in dune geomor- phology include the linking of shoreline morphodynamics to dune formation (e.g. SHORT and HESP, 1982; STEWART and DAVIDSON-ARNOTT, 1988; MARTINEZ and PsuTY, 2004), the development of storm-driven cyclic models of environmental change for low barrier dunes (HOSIER and CLEARY, 1977; SORENSEN and MCCREARY, 1985), and for re-evaluation of many of the long-accepted transport formulae (HORIKAWA et al., 1986; HOTTA, 1988). For further consideration of coastal dune morphology, the reader is referred to NORDSTROM et al. (1990). Dunes and beaches are intricately linked as integrated morphodynamic compartments that interact over different spatio-temporal scales. Coastal dune forms are essentially a function of sediment budget where the dune-beach sediment budget evolves, and through feedback mechanisms, new dune forms emerge. Leakage in the system contributes to local site diversity but the balance between the regional beach budget and regional foredune budget maintain the dune-beach mor- phological system (PSUTY, 1988, 1994; MARTINEZ and PSUTY, 2004). The range of coastal dune forms is conceptualized by MARTINEZ and PSUTY, 2004) in terms of a foredune devel- opmental sequence that pars foredune and beach sediment budgets. The resulting continuum extends from the condition of an extremely high positive sediment budget to a condition of extreme negative sediment budget where the sequence is highlighted by initial foredune mass increase, attainment of maximum mass, and then a decrease. The spatio-temporal sequencing of coastal foredune development results in a range of morphotypes from accretionary foredune ridges, ac- tive foredunes, parabolic dunes, to and sheets. Beach width, which acts both as a major control on sediment supply to foredunes, is in turn often affected by longshore sand waves (DAVIDSON-ARNOTT, 1988) thereby highlighting the beach- dune linkage and spatio-temporal influence of dune morpho- types. SHORT and HESP (1982) and SHORT (1988) clarify the deduction by specifically integrating dune morphotypes with beach states where waves, sediment supply, and grain size Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="17">ODO LN 171 Figure 6.

Some of the larger root casts contain interior linings of travertine, which makes the casts much stronger than those without microcrystalline carbonate linings.

Classification of Rocky Coasts (Cliffs and Platforms) A rocky coast may be defined as a coast that is cliffed and yet composed of consolidated material irrespective of its hard- ness (SUNAMURA, 1992). Rocky coasts (Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10; cf Figures 1 and 2) thus include shores composed of ma- terials ranging from hard rocks such as granite and basalt to relatively soft but cohesive material such as glacial deposits. These shores are thus commonly characterized by cliffs of various types and associated subjacent platforms (GRIGGS and TRENHAILE, 1994). Although cliffs occur behind approx- imately 80% of the world's coastline (ISAKOV, 1953; EMERY and KUHN, 1982; SUNAMURA, 1992), they have tended to re- ceive relatively little attention in the scientific literature. Since the postglacial sea-level rise (most recent transgres- sion initiated during the Hypsithermal Climatic Interval in the early Holocene) when the rate of sea level rose initially at an accelerating rate but then began to slow down (6000- 5000 YBP), marine processes have been working on rocky coasts to create characteristic shore-zone morphologies. Rocky coast morphologies are influenced by major variations that reflect: (1) lithological factors (i.e. rock types and geolog- ical structures, discontinuities, such as bedding planes, joints, and faults), (2) weathering properties of rocks, (3) tides, (4) degree of exposure to wave attack, and (5) the in- heritance of minor relative changes in land and sea levels. Recognition of relative land-sea movements was appreciated by many early workers who used various terms in reference to the vertical displacement of coastal features such as ter- races and platforms that would today be recognized as poly- genetic paleomorphs (see subsequent discussion). Uplift and displacement of coastal features from sea level to higher el- evations, for example, form terraced coasts (HOBBS, 1921, p. 104) viz. coastal terraces of San Clemente Island (California), raised reef terraces of Obi (Moluccas), terraces of the Coast Cordillera (Peru), coastal terraces of Oregon, tilted reefs on Alu (Solomon Islands), raised reef terraces on Eva (Tonga Islands), terraces on Siompu (Celebes), etc. Similar examples are cited from Central America and the Caribbean areas (e.g. VAUGHAN, 1919). Platforms developing around present sea level are fre- quently classified into: (1) gently sloping platforms without a significant topographic break, extending from the base of a cliff to the nearshore sea floor below low tide level, and (2) nearly horizontal platforms with a marked drop at their sea- ward edge. There are also steeply descending (plunging) cliffs that pass far below sea level without any shore platform. This classification follows BIRD (1976) who subdivided subhorizon- tal-platforms into two distinctive types according to the plat- form elevation, viz. high-tide and lowtide platforms. For sloping platforms, the literature has employed various terms: abrasion platforms (JOHNSON, 1919; WEFER et al., 1976); beach platforms (WOOD, 1968), benches (ZENKOVICH, 1967), coastal platforms (So, 1965), shore platforms (BAR- TRUM, 1916, 1924; BIRD and DENT, 1966; WRIGHT, 1967; BIRD, 1976; ROBINSON, 1977; TRENHAILE, 1987), submarine platforms (HEALY and WEFER, 1980), wave-cut benches (LEE, 1980), wave-cut platforms (BRADLEY, 1958; FAIRBRIDGE, 1968; BRADLEY and GRIGGS, 1976), wave-cut terraces (VON ENGELN, 1942), and wave ramps (HILLS, 1971, 1972). There are also other terms that describe horizontal or subhorizontal platforms, as discussed by SUNAMURA (1992): abrasion or de- nuded benches, coastal platforms, low rock terraces or plat- forms, rock platforms, shore benches, shore platforms, storm- wave platforms, wave-cut benches, wave-cut platforms, etc. Some of the nomenclature includes a genetic connotation such as "wave-cut," "abrasion," or "storm-wave." Because the platform genesis and formative processes have not yet been fully elucidated, purely descriptive terms are probably pref- erable (BIRD, 1976; PETHICK, 1984; TRENHAILE, 1987). Be- cause the term "shore platform" is appropriate and widely used in the modern literature, it is useful to distinguish two basic types on the basis of slope: Type-A (sloping) and Type- B (horizontal). According to TRENHAILE (1987), Type-A platforms are most common in macrotidal environments and Type-B platforms (Figure 8) in meso- and microtidal regions (Table 14), as shown in the example of Eva's Cay (Long Island), Bahamian Archipelago. Type-A platforms tend to develop in softer rocks, Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="19">184 Finkl Figure 8. Eva's Cay near Saltpond, Long Island, Bahamas. This microtidal tropical marine bench, exposed at low tide, was formed in calcarenite by the combined processes of marine biological weathering and erosion of the honeycomb structures by wave and current action during storms. Note the sandy perched beach sitting on top of the platform in front of the vegetation line. These rocky intertidal platforms provide natural protection against coastal erosion along the shores of many small islands. [Classification (Decametric scale): scoliomorphogenic rocky coast with marine bench, fringing the Bahama Bank Morphotype] but BIRD and DENT (1966) found that Type-B platforms give place to Type-A platforms at a place where locally derived shingle is available as an abrasive tool for waves. EDWARDS (1951) and HILLS (1972) recognized that Type-B platforms are well developed on headlands, with Type-A in intervening embayments, composed of less resistant materials. Recession of coastal cliffs is essential for both Types-A and -B to develop. Tides are also important in that (1) water level determines the elevation of wave action and controls the type of waves arriving at the cliff and (2) the tidal range may in- fluence weathering and biological activities, although the tide itself has no force to erode the cliff (SUNAMURA, 1992). Cliffs above the shore platforms may take various forms, in part due to inheritance and to marine processes. Some common types include, for example, plunging cliffs, castellated, and slope-over-wall (BIRD, 1976). From a geomorphological point of view, coastal cliffs are commonly grouped into the following main morphotypes (after BIRD, 1976): castellated, plunging, and slope-over-wall (Table 14). Examples of cliffed coasts are shown in Figure 9 (Oregon coast near Tillamook Bay) where a dissipative beach fronts cliffs of the Coast Range. In the example of northeastern Eleuthera Island (Figure 10), Ba- hamian Archipelago, steep-to cliffs front the Atlantic Ocean without beaches. CLASSIFICATION OF COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS Previous discussion has focused on physical processes and morphologic development of coastal morphologies, shapes and forms. Even though the units of classification were not clearly stipulated in some earlier systems, they were as- sumed or evident by their description. This section considers alternatives to the initial physically-based approach that con- siders form and process. Although environmental approaches are relatively new, they offer opportunity or possibilities to evaluate the coast in terms of ecological or biophysical sys- tems. Development of an internationally consistent world system of coastal classification is scientifically challenging. Terres- Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="20">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 185 trial, coastal, and marine realms are approached in quite dif- ferent ways. Thus, terrestrial biotic provinces are classified, for example, by UDVARDY (1975), AXELROD (1958), and ARE- CES-MALLEA et al. (1999) largely on the basis of vegetation. Coastal classification is largely by physical landforms and physical processes (e.g. COTTON, 1954; KING, 1966; BIRD, 1976; DOLAN et al., 1972, 1975); marine realms have been treated both physically (e.g. water masses) and biotically but no one method dominates. Some more recent approaches that focus, for example, on nearshore continental and oceanic is- land environments, within the littoral zone, are based on the water column and underlying benthic substrate together to form an integrated habitat unit (e.g. ZACHARIAS et al., 1998; ZACHARIAS and ROFF, 2000; ALLEE et al., 2001) as opposed to deeper water environments (e.g. GREENE et al., 1999). In the example of the Bahamian Archipelago, classification of coastal environments is based on combining elements of the NOAA marine classification (ALLEE et al., 2001), Caribbean vegetation classification (ARECES-MALLEA et al., 1999), and COWARDIN et al. (1979) to describe ecoregions and smaller ecounits of the natural system. The classification of coastal landscapes is a difficult task because within the general framework of landscape there is no separated definition. Most approaches consider the geographical landscape, geo- complexes, or characteristic complexes of ecosystem that is biocenosis with biotype as environmental approximations. LIND (1969) and FURMANCZYK et al. (2002) provide insight into coastal landscape classification by applying a linear ap- proach that differentiates natural components in unit-seg- ments of coast. DOLAN et al. (1972, 1973) provide insight into initial at- tempts to develop comprehensive classifications of coastal/ marine environments. The key element here is the consid- eration of environments as the objects of classification, not coastal features or morphological properties as discussed pre- viously. The coastal environment is a complex biophysical system in which terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric pro- cesses constantly interact. According to these workers, the processes are inseparable but modes of interaction (defined as natural coastal environmental complexes) can be identified by analysis of dominant processes. Classification of coastal environmental zones requires systematizing information both along and across the coast, as also described by LIND (1969). This stratification is based on scale and the natural variabil- ity of coastal environments. Because processes operating along-the-coast are mostly global and those operating across- the-coast are regional and local, the development of a clas- sification system demands analysis of relationships between atmospheric and marine processes, organization of geologic materials, and ecological donation within the coastal zone. Environments distributed across the coast are viewed as be- ing within and coupled to environments along the coast. Con- sequently, the two components of the so-called orthogonal coastal classification have a common unit, the elemental unit. Process zones across-the-coast include: (1) the deep water zone of the outer continental shelf, (2) shallow water zone of the inner continental shelf, (3) zone of intense shoaling and breaking (surf zone), (4) zone of extreme wave energy dissi- pation (surge zone), (5) zone of maximum tidal and atmo- spheric penetration, and (6) transitional zone of marine phys- iographic to continental physiographic dominance. Analysis of the sequence of environmental zones across the coast re- quires the amassing of data on the physical characteristics and dominant processes of the coastal environment. Accord- ing to DOLAN et al. (1973), most important information sets include: (1) mean and extreme wave climates, (2) tide ranges, (3) submarine topography, (4) terrestrial topography, (5) at- mospheric fluxes. The process of classification along the coast is divided into four steps: (1) analysis of the process, (2) mapping the distri- bution of geologic materials, (3) analysis of biotic systems in the vicinity of the coast, and (4) integration and assembly of these subunits of the classification. The process context is of two parts and yields the first two levels of the classification: atmospheric regimes and the oceanic subregimes. Analysis of the atmosphere is based on air mass climatol- ogy whereas oceans are characterized by the analysis of wa- ter masses. The materials context is stratified via the infor- mation gained through analysis of coastal landforms. This provides the information needed to integrate the principal units of the coastal interface with the ocean and atmosphere. The third part of the classification, verification of the re- gimes, subregimes, and interface units, is achieved through analysis of biotic provinces. The final phase is the integration of all three subunits of the classification. The Regimes The dominant characteristics of coastal climates are the consequence of specific atmospheric phenomena. These are: (1) dominant air masses, (2) confluence of airstreams in the coastal zone, (3) the path of the air mass systems, and (4) seasonality of the atmospheric phenomena. An understand- ing of the spatial and temporal distribution of these phenom- ena permits inferences about the weather elements: temper- ature, rainfall, winds, humidity, etc. The Subregimes Three continuous variables account for differences within the marine fluid environment: (1) water temperature, (2) sa- linity, and (3) currents. Other phenomena such as waves, tides, and turbidity tend to be discontinuous and are there- fore treated at a smaller scale (across the coast). The Interface The character of the coastal interface is the consequence of one or more dominant coastal zone processes: (1) marine (waves, tides, currents, etc.), (2) biologic (coral and mangrove growth), and (3) fluvial (fresh water drainage). The analysis and subdivision of these interface types requires complete coastal landform analysis and classification which was con- structed using topographic, geologic, hydrographic, and veg- etation maps and recorded observations in the Sailing Direc- tions Publication. A means whereby these classifications might be made more compatible is through consideration of physical and biotic properties together, as proposed by HAYDEN et al. (1984).

As a partial solution, HAYDEN et al. (1984) propose a classification system based on physical environments and related marine faunal provinces that come together in a 'zoophysiographic classification of coastal and marine environments'. An impor- tant problem concerns the 'coastal zone,' a broad ecotone that both divides and unites marine and terrestrial systems. RAY et al. (1981), following KETCHUM (1972), defined the coastal zone boundaries as follows: (1) The terrestrial boundary is defined by (a) the in- land extent of astronomical tidal influences, or (b) the inland limit of penetration of marine aerosols with the atmospheric boundary layer and including both salts and suspended liquids, whichever is greater. (2) The seaward limit is defined by (a) the outer extent of the continental shelf (approximately 200 m depth), or (b) the limit of territorial waters, whichever is greater. Definition 2b is jurisdictional, not biogeographical. It should be obvious that the coastal zone is very extensive, and that neither purely terrestrial nor purely oceanic approaches will suffice for its delimitation and ultimate classification. PIELOU (1979) observes that profound differences in com- munity structure and ecosystem function make the designa- tion of terrestrial and marine biogeographic regions by simi- lar methods difficult. She further observed, that: (1) vegeta- tion does not form a structural environment in most marine systems, (2) the oceans are contiguous and marine species have greater ranges than terrestrial species, (3) the bound- aries of dispersal are more subtle but the closer to land the clearer are the boundaries between regions, (4) latitudinal zonation is often more marked for marine species than for terrestrial ones, and (5) the ocean is three dimensional and biogeographical zonations are ones of depth as well as loca- tion. It thus appears that life forms are more varied in the sea than on land. Consequently, a marine coastal classifica- tion should not be approached in the same way as such an undertaking on land (HAYDEN et al., 1984). HAYDEN et al. (1984) provide a classification of marine and coastal areas according to attributes of the physical environ- ment and by the faunal assemblages involved. Ocean and coastal-margin realms are defined and mapped with the mar- ginal seas and archipelagos named according to their connec- tions to oceanic realms. For the Atlantic Ocean region, for example, there are four ocean realms (Table 15) and thirteen coastal-margin realms (Table 16). The defining characteris- tics of these realms are the seasonal variations in ocean sur- Table 14. Continued.

This incomplete list is meant to provide examples of the range of complex forms that are associated with cliffs and plat- forms.

While the boundaries between faunal provinces do not always match boundaries between ocean and coastal realms, the foundation is laid for a binomial designation system with the coastal or oceanic realm as 'genus' and the faunal province as the 'epi- thet' (HAYDEN et al., 1984). This brief summary of subglobal coastal-marine biogeographic provinces, following UDVARDY (1975) for the land, provides an example of an attempt that holds promise for rational comprehensive classification of coastal environments. RAY and HAYDEN (1992) take this approach on step further in their physical approach to classification within-province, coastal-zone structures for defining coastal units in which the connections among mass, energy, and biota across the coastal zone are stronger than along the coast. Here they recognize structural subdivisions of the coastal zone with each defined by gradients in ecological processes and attributes with: (a) simple type coastal systems in which the flow of water is restricted to tidelands and the shoreface entertainment vol- ume and (b) complex coastal systems in which a large drain- age system has sufficient flow to bypass the shoreface en- trainment volume and drains more less directly into the off- shore volume.

The length of coast, including only significant embayments and irregular indentations, is about 8500 km and spans more than thirty-five degrees of latitude from 40 30' N to 300 44' S Latitude at a scale of 100,000. Character- ization of the biophysical environment defines major prop- erties of the continental platform to variable distances in- land. Biogeographical classifications as well as geomorpho- logical groupings are included for each folio sheet. Examples of geomorphic units for the Rio de Janeiro littoral include: modern and Holocene fluvial deposits, rocky platforms, sandy shore, coastal plain, dunes, cliffs, coastal valleys and marshy lowlands, littoral plains, mountains and escarpments, etc. Many of the classificatory units are combinations of the geo- morphic base plus the soil cover, vegetation type, and drain- age (hydraulics).

The Brazilian classification of coastal environ- ments is comparable to the Canadian effort (OWENS, 1994) as far as length of coastline classified is concerned, but the MMA system is more diverse and comprehends a greater range of environments whereas the geomorphology of Cana- dian shores is more clearly elucidated. Both schemes inter- pret coastal environmental resources in terms of susceptibil- ity or sensitivity to perturbation due to anthropogenic input (i.e. risks from oil spills). Both the Brazilian and Canadian systems, which have specialized goals and different purposes, contain useful elements that should be considered in the de- velopment of geomorphological classification of coasts; nei- ther of these approaches are universal or comprehensive, however. Method of Coastal Land Systems Mapping Generalization of map units incurs apparent loss and change in spatial distribution at different scales. Tradition- ally, an area-class map such as a vegetation or geologic map consisted of a set of map units, or polygons, with a single attribute identifying the predominant class within it. The classes themselves are usually described in terms of the mix- ture of associated classes that could typically be found in a nonhomogeneous area. Seldom are individual map units characterized more fully in terms of the set of classes within them. If a single-attribute map is generalized, map units are aggregated and the dominant class of the aggregate is as- signed as the attribute. Both spatial and taxonomic precision are lost as the result. Similar problems are faced in terrain mapping, land resource assessment, and coastal classification where small or included subsets are unnoticed. One method used to overcome this problem is seen in the Australian concept of a land system (CHRISTIAN and STEW- ART, 1953; BRINK et al., 1966; SPEIGHT, 1968) where a "land system" consists of a recurring pattern of landforms, soils, and vegetation. The lower order "land facets" which make up the land system are described but not mapped. The concept of a land system has been adapted to coastal conditions ex- tent along the southeast coast of the Florida peninsula in the Broward Coastal Zone (BCZ). Coastal land (hydrologic) sys- tems in the BCZ were reproduced at a scale of 1:24,000 to conform to U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangles (FINKL, 1994a). The map units were subsequently digitized and brought into GIS because the ability to store multiple attributes for each map unit in a relational database system is a powerful advantage of modern GIS over traditional map products. In a simple land system, there is a group of closely related topographic units that are produced by common geomorpho- logical (land-forming) processes. The topographic units thus constitute a geographically associated series that are directly and consequently related to one another. The landscape pat- terns within a land system are regularly occurring groupings that always exhibit the same spatial interrelationships. The approach used by FINKL (1994a) follows the land-system sur- veys of the C.S.I.R.O. (Commonwealth Scientific and Indus- trial Research Organization, Australia) (e.g. CHRISTIAN and STEWART, 1953, 1968; BECKETT and WEBSTER, 1965; BRINK Table 18. Coastal land systems as applied to the southeast Florida coast. (After Finkl, 1994). Coastal Land Systems Description Lauderdale Strand Narrow littoral belt of Holocene shore and beach, including dune fields and overwash fans Spanish River Sand Hills Narrow coastal uplands containing Pleis- tocene parallel dunes, includes ridge and swale topography St. Mathew Marshlands Low coastal wetlands that were formerly freshwater marsh but now converting to saltwater marsh McNab Floodways Flat lowlands with galeria-like forests that border meandering streams and rivers Stranahan Prairies Coast-perpendicular valleys that are broad, flat-floored, and contain sandy lowlands with grassy tracts, flooded part of the year Himmarshee Sand Plains Sandy upland terrain characterized by plains of low relief which lack defined drainageways Miami Ridge High limestone rockland with undulating relief which rises sharply above the surrounding landscapes, now karstified with solution holes Mickel Transverse Glades Coast-perpendicular valleys that are east-west extensions of the Florida Ev- erglades et al., 1966). This system of land pattern recognition in en- vironmental division is based on hydrologic and climatomor- phogenic principles. The main advantage of this system is that it coordinates all of the major landscape features into one unit rather than separately identifying landforms, soils, vegetation, and hydrology. Coastal land systems occurring in the BCZ include subdivisions of low coastal wetlands, alluvial plains and terraces (including floodways), coast-perpendicu- lar valleys, upland sandy terrain, and high limestone rock- lands (Table 18). Primary coastal land systems (combinations of topography, drainage and hydrology, soil associations, geology, and veg- etation) were mapped (FINKL, 1994a) from the shore to about 2.5 km inland. The land systems are subdivisions of WHITE'S (1970) Everglades, Atlantic Coastal Ridge, and Eastern Val- ley physiographic units. Identification of natural land units is directly related to the recognition of pre-development nat- ural drainage ways (e.g. swales, sloughs, swamps, transverse glades, etc.), basin outflow points, soils subject to prolonged flooding, determination of flood prone areas, etc. Mapping of coastal environments was based on aerial photointerpreta- tion of circa 1940-45 imagery (uncontrolled mosaics and ste- reo-paired aerial photographs, produced by the USDA Agri- cultural Stabilization and Conservation Service and available from the National Archives) at a scale of approximately 1: 40,000. Aerial photointrepretation was based on older imag- ery because natural landscape (geomorphic) features are more clearly evident prior to extensive drainage of coastal wetlands (Everglades, transverse glades, wet prairies, marshes, and sloughs), canalization, and urban development. Definitions of the various coastal environmental units incor- porates historical (predevelopment) and recent data from Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="26">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 191 vegetation surveys, particularly those that stress vegetation- soils-topographic-drainage relationships (e.g. DAVIs, 1943; AUSTIN, 1976), soil surveys (e.g. PENDLETON et al., 1984), U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps (AMS4936 IISE-Se- ries V847: Boca Raton, Pompano Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Port Everglades, Hollywood sheets), geological-geomorpho- logical survey reports (e.g. SANFORD, 1909; WHITE, 1970), and ecological and hydrology-climatology maps (e.g. sheets from the Florida Ecological Atlas-US Fish and Wildlife Ser- vice (FWS), 1984). Primary classical sources of habitat de- scription for southern Florida were generally compiled after 1900 and are summarized in FINKL (1994). Eight coastal land systems are identified in the BCZ (Table 18). For ease of reference, each land system is identified by a geographic name that precedes a descriptive physiographic term. The named systems listed here, in general order ac- cording to their relative elevations above sea level and dis- tance inland from the coast, are as follows: Lauderdale Strand, Spanish River Sand Hills, St. Mathew Marshlands, McNab Floodways, Stranahan Prairies, Himmarshee Sand Plains, Miami Ridge, and Mickel Transverse Glades. Each land system is briefly described in terms of salient natural features and geographic extent in the eastern BCZ. Lauderdale Strand The Lauderdale Strand, a coastal unit that makes up the shore and beach, is characterized by narrow littoral belts that are com- posed of Holocene beaches, dune fields, and overwash fans. Eleva- tions of sand dunes and beach ridges in this narrow coastal belt range from near sea level to heights of about 7 m along dune crests. Vegetation associated with the Lauderdale Strand includes cabbage palm, seagrape, sawpalmetto, cactus, and sea-oats and other grass- es. Backdunes that provide some protection from ocean winds and salt spray support dense growths of trees and shrubs. Thin weakly developed, coarse-textured soils are associated with these excessive- ly drained dune sands. Spanish River Sand Hills These old coastal dune systems comprise narrow coastal uplands. The older dunes are aligned roughly parallel to the present coastline and form a ridge and swale topography where long, narrow, shallow, trough-like depressions (swampy runnels) occur between dunes. The vegetation that occurs in association with these landforms is dis- tinctly zoned. Low-growing grasses, vines, and stunted shrubs grow in the dry ridge crests whereas larger trees are found in the swampy runnels. Sandy, excessively drained (droughty) calcareous soils with minimal profile development occur along the ridge crests and con- trast strongly with the poorly drained organic-rich soils of the run- nels. St. Mathew Marshlands The St. Mathew Marshlands are low coastal wetlands that were fresh water marsh prior to the cutting of inlets and the Intracoastal Waterway (ICWW), canalization, and digging of drainage ditches for mosquito control in the late 1920's and early 1930's (AuSTIN, 1976; FINKL, 1993). These landscapes have flat to hummocky topographies that lie at elevations generally less than 2 m above mean sea level. Some relict beach ridges occurring inland from the Lauderdale Strand produce a faint linear relief that lies more or less parallel the present coastline. Unconsolidated deposits with lenses of organic materials and buried beach ridges range up to 4 or 5 m in thickness. These sandy and organic-rich materials overlie solution-pitted oolitic and shell-hash limestones in eastern Fort Lauderdale. These marsh- es occupy broad shallow depressions in the limestones where beach sands, peats, and mucks have accumulated. The natural vegetation of these marshes (glades) mainly consists of sedges, rushes, and a few hydrophilic trees along the drier margins. Soils in this unit are characterized by very poorly drained mucks or sandy clay loams that overlie loamy sand and organic soils that are in turn underlain by clay or sand. McNab Floodways The McNab Floodways are flat lowlands that border meandering streams and rivers. The narrow floodways are usually dry but may become inundated by rising waters at flood stages during the wet season or after high rainfall events. Galeria-like forests containing bald cypress, live oak, gumbo limbo, and palmetto palms flank the sinuous river valleys. These fringing forests apparently impressed early settlers who described the "jungles" for which the region was once known. Organic-rich alluvial soils cover the contemporary flood- plain and older terraces. The McNab Floodways link the Everglades, via coast-perpendicular valleys, with the coastal St. Mathew Marsh- lands. Stranahan Prairies The Stranahan Prairies occupy coast-perpendicular valleys that tend to flank the Mickel Transverse Glades. These broad, flat- floored, sandy lowlands are grassy tracts that connect with coastal river floodplains and merge with the Everglades inland. Natural vegetation consists of grasses, rushes, sedges, and other herbaceous plants and low shrubs. The very poorly drained soils are often sat- urated for two or more months of the year but seldom have ponded water at the surface. The soils are coarse textured or have mineral surfaces that are underlain by clay or sand. These wet prairies occur at somewhat higher relative elevations but flank or merge with the St. Mathew Marshlands, McNab Floodways, and Mickel Transverse Glades. The Stranahan Prairies occur mainly inland of the Miami Ridge except northeast of Fort Lauderdale where they butt up against the backdunes of the Lauderdale Strand. These wet prairies are transitional landscapes that occur between lower-lying wetlands and dry sandplains of the uplands. Himmarshee Sand Plains This upland sandy terrain is characterized by plains of low to mod- erate relief. The sand plains lie at an average elevation of about 2.5 to 4 m above sea level. These sand plains, which lack defined surface drainage networks, are composed of thick accumulations of porous white sands. The deep sands tend to be well drained but in some topographically restrictive situations they may be stained black or red by dissolved iron compounds or organic matter. The vegetation of these dry sandy uplands is dominated by flatwoods, open pine stands with an understory of sawpalmetto and grasses. Thick, strongly developed soils occur throughout the plains. These soils are notable for their dark colored surface horizons that overlie bleached layers that in turn overlie dark brown-colored illuvial horizons that are several meters thick. Miami Ridge This land system is a high limestone rockland. The rocky lime- stone ridges with undulating relief rise sharply above surrounding landscapes to reach extreme elevations of 7 to 8 m above MSL. The ridge is mainly composed of case-hardened oolitic (egg-shaped) cal- careous sands that are very porous. The surface of the ridge is often pock-marked by solution holes that extend for several meters below the ground surface (PARKER et al., 1955; PENDLETON et al., 1984). The holes, which are commonly filled by fine-grained materials, now provide good sites for vegetative growth. The predominant vegeta- tion of live oak, laurel, and water oak along with gumbo limbo, mas- tic, and sable (cabbage) palm continues to form an open hardwood subtropical hammock where left undisturbed. The sandy soils are generally thin and rocky. These lithosols show little modification of their calcareous parent materials and mainly result from meager accumulation of organic detritus from the xerophyllus vegetation. Aside from the occasional massive outcrop, limestone rocks are fre- quently strewn about the ground surface or occur near the soil sur- Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="27">192 Finkl face in many places. Thicker and moister soils occur in large solution pits and karst depressions that are distributed sporadically about the ridge surface. Mickel Transverse Glades The Mickel Transverse Glades are cost-perpendicular valleys that are essentially east-west extensions of the Everglades (PARKER et al., 1955). These broad, flat-floored, shallow valleys of low gradient have poorly defined thalwegs. The upper valley side slopes of the shallow depressions merge upstream with the Everglades whereas downstream the diffluent drainage of the floodways merge with prai- ries and alluvial floodplains. The natural vegetation is predomi- nantly wet grassland (marsh bog) that is composed of sawgrass and other sedges and rushes. The soils are very poorly drained with marly or organic surfaces that are underlain by unconsolidated sed- iments that in turn overlie limestone. Ecological Classification of Coastal Environments Although there are many examples of ecological character- ization of localized coastal environments, experience with the Florida Spring Coast (WOLFE, 1990) illustrates the tech- nique. Landscapes of this Gulf-coastal watershed on the west coast of the Florida peninsula are described in terms of ter- restrial, freshwater, saltwater wetland, estuarine, and marine habitats. The classification system used here consists of 15 general categories of native biological communities, and an- other three of human-dominated habitat types. This classi- fication (Table 19) is similar to the one used by the FLORIDA GAME AND FRESH WATER FISH COMMISSION (1976), which provides for comprehensive investigation of habitats in north central Florida, and is based in part on information obtained from the CORPS OF ENGINEERS (1978) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services' Gulf Coast Ecological Inventory map series (BECCASIA et al., 1982). The advantage of this organized sys- tem is that it is open-ended and additions of both general and more specific units can be accommodated. Although no clas- sification systems fits the real situation perfectly, this ap- proach seems to approximate habitats and their interrela- tionships better than a lengthy list of map units or habitat types (WOLFE, 1990). The main categories of terrestrial and fresh water habitat are listed in Table 19. Classification of saltwater habitats generally follows the scheme of COWARDIN et al. (1979). The Springs Coast occupies a zone of transition in coastal vegetation, changing from mangrove dominated coastal habitats in the south to salt-marsh-dominated habi- tats in the north. The entire coastline, however, discharges substantial quantities of freshwater from myriad streams, springs, and areas of sheet flow. This, coupled with the low- energy regime, yields a coastline that generally has salinities below those considered marine (&gt; 30 ppt) and that is heavily vegetated. The inshore waters of the Springs Coast exhibit typical estuarine salinity patterns, and the flora and fauna found therein are characteristically estuarine (WOLFE, 1990). More recent efforts at ecosystem-oriented criteria feature the development of a national coastal/marine classification standard for the US (MADDEN, 2003) that can be used across multiple spatial (from micro, 1 m, to continental, 107 m) and temporal scales. In this system, relationships between levels of the hierarchy are defined by environmental processes and biological interactions. The goal or purpose of this effort is to support the production of a set of detailed, quantitative GIS Table 19.

Classification of Coastal/Marine Environments Using Digital Aerial Photography and Satellite Remote Sensor Data Satellite and airborne remote sensors have been used for several decades to map land use and surface cover to assist in the interpretation of natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Environmental remote sensing offers the ability to classify large areas of the earth's surface and provide accu- rate descriptions of biophysical resources and changing con- ditions through time. Through NOAA's coastal ocean pro- gram, the change analysis project (C-CAP) is designed to de- termine land/habitat cover and spatial change for sea grass, emergent wetlands and adjacent uplands in coastal regions of the U.S. on a one to five year repeating basis (PATIENCE and KLEMAS, 1993). The advantage of these remotely-sensed systems is that they can provide nearly continuous coverage over large areas and data can be acquired in a timely manner for regional-scale surveys. The C-CAP project uses digital re- mote sensor data, in situ measurement in conjunction with global positioning system (GPS) technology to monitor chang- es in coastal wetland habitats and adjacent uplands. Landsat Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="28">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 193 Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data, landsat thematic mapper (TM) data, and spot high resolution visible (HRV) data have been used successfully to detect major categories of coastal wetlands and nearshore bottom (coral reef) features (e.g. FINKL and DAPRATO, 1993). The use of satellite imagery for mapping wetlands provides a number advantages over con- ventional aerial photographs including timeliness, synoptici- ty, and reduced costs (DOBSON et al., 1995). The C-CAP na- tionally standardized database is used to monitor land cover and habitat change in the coastal regions of the United States and to improve understanding of coastal uplands, wetlands, and submerged habitats. C-CAP regions (based on NOAA/ NMFS administrative regions) are commonly subdivided on the basis of state or other administrative boundaries or ecore- gions. Most boundaries encompass coastal watersheds, (e.g. estuarine drainage areas) plus offshore coral reefs, algae, and seagrass beds in the photic zone. Coastal land cover information is typically stored in the C-CAP database. The C-CAP Land Cover Classification System includes three superclasses (KLEMAS et al., 1993): upland, wetland, and water and submerged land (Table 20). These superclasses are subdivided into classes and subclasses that reflect ecological relationships and land-cover classes that can be discriminated primarily from satellite remote sensor data. The system was adapted and designed to be compatible with other nationally standardized classification systems, viz. (1) the U.S. Geological Survey "Land Use and Land Cover Classification System for Use with Remote Sensor Data" (AN- DERSON et al., 1976), (2) the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service "Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States" (COWARDIN et al., 1979), and (3) the U.S. En- vironmental Protection Agency Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) classification system (see discussion in DOBSON et al., 1995). While all categories of the C-CAP classification system can be represented as two-di- mensional features at the mapping scale of 1:24,000, some features may be mapped as lines (e.g. rocky shore) or points (e.g. unique landmarks). Most liner and point features, how- ever, can be obtained from nonsatellite sources of information (e.g. aerial photography or in situ measurements using GPS). The upland superclass consists of seven subclasses: Devel- oped Land, Cultivated Land, Grassland, Woody Land, Bare Land, Tundra, and Snow/Ice. These upland classes are adapt- ed from ANDERSON et al. (1976). Wetland in the C-CAP Coastal Land-Cover Classification System includes all areas considered wetland by COWARDIN et al. (1979), except for bot- toms, reefs, aquatic beds, and nonpersistant emergent wet- lands. All areas of open water with less than 30% cover of trees, shrubs, persistent emergent plants, emergent mosses, or lichens, are assigned to the superclass Water and Sub- merged Land, whether the area is considered wetland or deepwater habitat under the COWARDIN et al. (1979) classi- fication. Clearly these kinds of units provide valuable and useful information for the characterization of coastal environments. The C-CAP project provides the added advantage that much data is already archived and if it is not available for a specific area, it can be readily acquired following the C-CAP proto- cols. Important maps and other sources of collateral data in the US include the National Estuarine Inventory (NEI), the National Coastal Wetlands Database (in digital format as the National Estuarine Inventory Data Atlas), characterization of shoreline types (Strategic Assessment Branch of the Ocean Assessments Division, NOAA) [estuarine shoreline: fringe tidal flat, deep tidal flat, non-tidal flat, fringe marsh, deep marsh, ocean boundary, modified shoreline] (NOAA, 1986). COASTAL CLASSIFICATION AND MAP LEGENDS: GLOBAL AND CONTINENTAL SCALES The encyclopedic compilations of BIRD and SCHWARTZ (1985) and relevant topics discussed in SCHWARTZ (1982) and SNEAD (1982) were perused in an attempt to abstract the names of classification units applied to coastal segments. The terms used for the enclosed maps of coastal geomorphology are related to local scales. The National Atlas of the United States (1970), for example, bases most of the maps for the conterminous U.S. (exclusive of Alaska and Hawaii) on a scale of 1:7,500,000. The classification is broken down into three parts: (1) Coastal Configuration, (2) Coastal Composi- tion, and (3) Shoreline Characteristics. The coastal maps were prepared by Robert Dolan (University of Virginia) and the logic of the classification is consistent with some of his later reports (e.g. DOLAN et al., 1972, 1973). Map units are listed in Table 21 along with some suggested alliterative ap- proaches that might have more applicability to a world clas- sification system rather than one based on the US shoreline. Another approach is seen in the World Ocean Atlas (1979), published by Pergamon Press and edited by S.G. Gorshkov, the Admiral of the Fleet of the Navy of the USSR, in two large volumes. The atlas is one of the most complete and com- prehensive modern studies of the world ocean (GORSHKOV, 1979). [The Russian legend for coastal geomorphology is par- tially translated and summarized in Table 22] A PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM OF COASTAL CLASSIFICATION BASED ON GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SITE CHARACTERIZATION The foregoing examples of different approaches to coastal classification provide a base from which to consider which applications are most relevant to specific needs. Before any conclusions can be reached, it is necessary to briefly review methods and procedures that are specifically related to geo- morphological survey and mapping. Previously discussed sys- tems refer to coastal geomorphology or geomorphic features but they are not morphological classifications sensu stricto. Fortunately, the International Geographical Union (IGU) has sponsored decades-long research into the philosophy of geo- morphological mapping as well as assisted with the devel- opment of morphological classification at a variety of scales ranging from global coverage to local plans (GELLERT, 1971). This last bit of information is crucial to the proposed univer- sal approach for a scheme that depends on previous success in coastal classification as well as adapting relevant princi- ples of geomorphological classification as related to the coast- al zone.

General Principles of Geomorphological Mapping in Relation to Coastal Forms The subject of geomorphological mapping is the Earth's re- lief, i.e. the surface of the Earth's crust at its contact with the hydrosphere, atmosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere. This complex zone of surface amplitudes is what BUDEL (1982) Table 21.

The relief sphere is the subject of geomorphology. Relief is complex and consists of elevations and depressions. The aim of geomorphological mapping is to investigate the morphology, genesis, and age of the relief. The following points are of primary consideration in achieving the goals of geomorphological mapping (DEMEK, 1972; DEMEK and EMBLETON, 1976): (1) Effects of structure in terms of lithology and tectonics, (2) Dynamic processes (both endogenic and exogenic), (3) Development and age of relief, (4) Spatial distribution of the different forms and form as- sociations, (5) Practical significance of the relief to society. Principles of Geomorphological Classification The basis of geomorphological classification is the principle that relief elements of lower order depend on elements of higher orders. That is, morphological continuity throughout the system of classification is achieved by logical transition- ing via morphostructures between units of higher or lower order. The relief forms are thus a complicated geosystem with numerous feedbacks. The characteristics of different orders, or levels, in a classification system vary according to the properties of the objects being classified. Classifications should reflect both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the objects. The main units of classification must posses unified and distinctive characteristics. These principles apply to each level in the taxonomic hierarchy. Classification must be of a cause-and-effect nature; it must be historic and genetic. Each relief element of any order has its own genesis and history of formation. At each level in the hierarchy, the classification must reflect a regular relationship between the general and the separate (DEMEK and EMBLETON, 1976). Prerequisites and Bases of Geomorphological Classification The study of morphostructures, morphostructural analysis, is a primary basis of geomorphological investigation. Mor- phostructures of various taxonomic ranks reflect different de- grees of interaction of endogenic and exogenic processes, Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="31">196 Finkl Table 22.

Classification of geomorphological maps, for the Geomorpho- logical Map of Europe, as recommended by the International Geographical Union, Commission on Geomorphological Survey and Mapping. Map Scale' Type of Map Scale Range Large-scale maps Plans 1:10,000 and larger Basic maps 1:10,000-1:25,000 Detailed maps 1:25,000-1:100,000 Medium-scale maps Synoptic maps 1:100,000-1:1,000,000 Small-scale maps Maps of countries 1:1,000,000-1:5,000,000 Maps of continents 1:5,000,000-1:30,000,000 World maps 1:30,000,000 and smaller 1 Based on Gellert (1971) greater or lesser tectonic activity, and different climatic con- ditions on the earth's surface. Morphostructures of the 1st order represent fundamental units of the Earth's relief, the continents and ocean basins. These are the largest morphostructures, related to differenc- es in the thickness and composition of the Earth's crust and upper mantle. The 2nd order morphostructures deal with the continents and oceans as a whole which finds its expression in forms such as continental platforms, shelves, slopes, abys- sal plains, and midocean ridges. The 3rd order includes the continental platforms which are subdivided into two separate morphostructures, plains and mountains. Continental plains of the 3rd order are subdivided into 4th order plains of de- nudation and deposition. The morphological difference be- tween these depends on whether uplift or subsidence has been dominant in the neotectonic period. In the 5th order, depositional plains are divided into separate morphostruc- tures according to the type of depression in which sediments accumulated and the depth of the basement complex. Differ- ences between morphostructures in the 6th order are even more sharply defined. Depositional plains are differentiated according to the character of sedimentation, e.g. fluvial, gla- cio-marine, lacustrine. Classification of megamorphostructu- res in the first five orders can provide a basis for geomor- phological maps of the world and continents on scales smaller than about 1:15,000,000 (DEMEK and EMBLETON, 1976). The classification of morphostructures is the basis of the legend for medium-scale (1:100,000 to 1,000,000) geomorpho- logical maps. Relief classes are based on relief amplitude, the relative difference between the lowest and highest points in an area of 16 km2. Relief type refers to a regional unit com- prising a distinctive and homogeneous assemblage of forms grouped within a certain altitudinal range. Each unit is char- acterized by similar morphology and genesis related to a com- mon morphostructural basis, by the same complex of geo- morphological processes and by a similar history of develop- ment. The relief type is in turn formed of particular relief forms such as river terraces, gullies, terminal moraines. Definition and Classification of Geomorphological Maps Scale is of considerable significance for geomorphological mapping because at a scale of approximately 1:500,000 the content of the map changes substantially (Table 23). Whereas maps on a scale larger than this (they cover relatively smaller Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="32">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 197 areas) usually depict relief forms, maps on smaller scales (they cover relatively larger areas) show form associations on a morphostructural basis. The scale thus indicates the degree of generalization, synopticity, and the sizes of features rep- resented. On the basis of scale, several types of geomorpho- logical maps can be distinguished. The International Geo- graphical Union (IGU) recommends the scheme in Table 23. Geomorphological Methods and Procedures in Geomorphological Mapping Geomorphological mapping, especially at medium scales, is based on one of the following methods of analysis, or on com- binations of two or more of them. The morphological method consists of (1) determining the limit and dimensions of indi- vidual relief elements, (2) defining the component of complete landforms, and (3) establishing the relations between differ- ent relief elements for an entire area, the character of their associations and the pattern of their arrangement. The mor- phological method also includes morphometric analysis. The morphofacies method is used to study relationships between the relief and correlative deposits, as well as de- tailed investigation of these deposits. The investigations in- clude laboratory studies to determine the age of the deposits and studies of the relation between the deposits and the land- forms. The morphostructural method is used to determine rela- tions between the landforms and geological structure. The distribution of relief elements is in direct relationship to the geological structure of the area. The distribution of rocks of different resistance within these tectonic units will also con- tribute substantially to the relations of the landforms with geological structure. The morphogeographical method is concerned with the study of the relation of the relief with other geospheres of the Earth, mainly atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and bio- sphere. The distribution of exogenic processes on the Earth's surface is controlled by the pattern of latitudinal climatic zo- nation which is disturbed and complicated by mountainous relief. The morphodynamic method studies the dynamics of pre- sent day endogenic and exogenic processes as essential for understanding the genesis and age of landforms, and the di- rection and intensity of their development. This necessitates observation of processes in the field, especially when their activity is greatest. These kinds of observations are essential for practical purposes, engineering works, etc. Several pro- cedures are used to study present relief-forming processes. The most important are those which involve: (1) field obser- vations at fixed sites, (2) prediction of catastrophic exo- and endogenic events on the basis of statistical analysis of their recurrence intervals, (3) experimental study, and (4) compar- ison of air and space photographs taken before and after par- ticular events. The paleogeomorphological method studies the relief of previous geological periods since remnants of former land- scapes are frequently incorporated in the present landscape. In analyzing the present relief, special attention is paid to the stages of transformation of the primary land surface into the present one. Attempts should be made to fix approximate dates for these major stages in the evolution of relief and drainage. Generalization of Geomorphological Maps The purpose of the general geomorphological map is to ex- press the morphographic and morphometric features of the re- lief forms, their genesis and age. The uniform map legend provides for the smooth transition from detailed geomorpho- logical maps to the synoptic ones. The main problem of the construction and generalization of geomorphological maps is that of the classification and systematization of relief forms (cf TRICART, 1955, 1965). The smallest taxonomic unit is the genetically homogeneous surface (GHS), a geometrically sim- ple flat area without a more distinct break of slope, generally of a size from some tenths of square meters up to some square kilometers. GHS units combine to create relief forms. These forms usually correspond to longer stages in the relief devel- opment (DEMEK, 1967). Their dimensions vary over a rela- tively large range from some hundreds of square meters up to hundreds of square kilometers. The forms compose the re- lief type, a complex of forms on a more or less distinctly lim- ited area, noted for the same absolute elevation and the same genesis depending on the same morphostructure, the same complexes of morphogenetic agents, and the same history of development. The relief type is not a concrete unit, but an abstract unit established deductively. Detailed Geomorphological Maps (1:10,000-1:50,000) The main contents of detailed geomorphological maps are the concrete relief forms and their parts. The decomposition of relief forms into GHS units appears to be a practical so- lution (DEMEK, 1967). These surfaces are mapped in the field by noting the edges and breaks of slopes bordering them. The GHS units are divided into groups according to their incli- nation, origin, and age. The representation of morphostruc- tures in the geomorphological maps provides a basis for in- corporating dependence of relief on geomorphological struc- ture, prevailing rock type, and as well as helping to establish the direction of the general development of the relief reflect- ing the development of the structural-geological units. The morphostructures thus allow for a transition to small-scale maps, the main contents of which are relief types defined in relation to morphostructure (DEMEK, 1967). These maps are built up from plans and basic geomorphological maps that contain form elements, miniforms, and microforms (cf Table 24). These maps show genetically homogeneous and indepen- dent forms where the dominant process acts without mor- phographically recognizable interruption (DEMEK and EM- BLETON, 1967). Medium-Scale Geomorphological Maps (1:200,000 to 1:500,000) The concept of medium-scale maps is that they should be similar to detailed maps but the contents of these maps, con- crete relief forms, are suitably simplified according to the scale. These maps are analytical and contain all the neces- Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="33">198 Finkl sary data that would enable the delimitation of relief types and thus the transition to small scale maps. Experience has shown that maps of concrete relief forms are more practical than maps of relief types because practice reckons with con- crete surfaces (DEMEK, 1967). These maps show mesoforms that are comprised by genetically independent cyclic forms that represent partial integration of a number of microforms. The dominant factor acts with one or several effective breaks conditioned tectonically or climatically (DEMEK and EMBLE- TON, 1976). Small-Scale Synoptic Maps (1:1,000,000 and less) These maps are usually constructed on the basis of the re- lief type representation. These are maps of geomorphological regions completed with selected relief forms. These maps of countries, continents, and the world integrate macro- and megaforms. They show the largest, continuous, form complex of individual character predominantly controlled by tectonics (DEMEK and EMBLETON, 1976). STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF THE NEW UNIFIED GEOMORPHOLOGICAL COASTAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM The purpose of presenting summaries of prior coastal clas- sifications was partly review, a reminder of what has been done before, according to the philosophy that the present can not be built without reference to the past. The point of that effort was to briefly summarize the main features of extent systems being sure to indicate advantages of each classifi- cation as well possible deficiencies. From some of these sys- tems (e.g. SUESS, 1888; JOHNSON, 1919; SHEPARD, 1973; COTTON, 1952; VALENTIN, 1952) it is apparent that with time the coastal classifications became more comprehensive and sophisticated in approach because increasingly numerous pa- rameters were considered in the characterization of coasts as shown by the evolutionary trends implied in Table 24. Be- cause the list of individual parameters grew with time and experience, many researchers came to appreciate critical cat- egories (structures, processes, materials, etc.) that were nec- essary to achieve more complete understanding of coasts. One of the most important properties of coasts is, for example, associated with antecedence, the inherited characteristics that give the present-day coast its distinctive appearance (e.g. EVANS et al., 1985; HINE et al., 1988; RIGGS et al., 1996; FITZ- GERALD and HETEREN, 1999) as recognized in emergent or submergent categories in the classifications. Because most coasts are now seen as having a polygenetic history, i.e. they retain component features (forms or materials) left over from previous cycles of development associated with changes in relative sea level, modern coastal classification is inherently complex. The degree of complexity depends in part on the width (across-the-shore component) of the coastal segment being classified, age of the coastal zone, and whether previous sea level stands are revisited by younger fluctuations to pro- duce palimpsest patterns. Superimposed on complex inher- ited coastal morphologies is the imprint of more recent ma- rine processes as they affect the erodibility of different kinds of materials under different climatic regimes. Table 25 lists some of the more important parameters that have been considered in previous systems, whether the coast- al property was given a high or lower position in the classi- fication scheme, and how these parameters relate to the pro- posed classification system outlined in Table 24. The JOHN- SON (1919) and SHEPARD (1948, 1973) systems were perhaps intended to be comprehensive global classifications but they lacked scope, flexibility, and the degree of specificity that is now possible through modern data acquisition techniques such as satellite remote sensing. More recent coastal classi- fications abandoned some of the more subjective aspects of previous systems (e.g. interpretations of emergence, submer- gence) by focusing on coastal materials and forms (e.g. SFRPC, 1984; OWENS, 1994; SUNAMURA, 1992; SHORT, 1999) that could be observed in the field, summarized from existing topographic-geologic maps, from aerial photographs, or from space imagery. Some of the specialized classifications, as op- posed to the global schemes, which concentrated on specific kinds of features such as coral reefs, beach types, cliffs and platforms, islands, and coastal habitats (including coastal zoogeographic provinces and realms) are useful but limited schemes. Thus, from these different kinds of coastal classifications, it is clear that a new scheme is required, one that is unified, comprehensive (global in scope), and structured. It is sug- gested that the unifying property in the new scheme should be coastal morphology; morphometry (in a range of scales) will provide transitioning from one categorical level to anoth- er and is the thread or theme that will run through the sys- tem from highest to lowest levels. This new geomorphological classification of coasts needs to embrace all important factors that are related to the identification and classification of coastal features in terms of: shape or form, lithic composition, susceptibility (or resistance) to erosion, effects of lithospheric (geotectonic, isostatic movement) and oceanic modulation (eustasy, steric effects, tides, etc.), antiquity of coastal land- forms as related to hypsometry and order of sedimentary se- quences, paleogeography of global shorelines, and erosional (destructional) and depositional (constructional) process, among others. These disparate factors or considerations can be grouped in a more orderly fashion under the general head- ings of: lithic criteria, chronometric parameters, geodynamic and climatomorphogenic processes, morphogenetic (morpho- dynamic) relief features, and polygenetic forms. With these thoughts in mind, the new system is based on the principles and practices of geomorphological mapping that have been worked out for the geomorphic map of Europe (see previous discussion). This multinational project, which was initiated through the International Geographical Union (IGU) in the early 1960s and largely completed in the late 1980s, provides a sound basis for devising a comprehensive classification of coastal landforms. The essential principles laid down in the manuals for geomorphological mapping are thus adapted to special needs in coastal areas. There are many problems associated with coastal classification (see pre- vious discussions) and perhaps the most important or over- riding problem is that coasts tend to be complex with older and younger features occurring in close proximity to produce a palimpsest pattern of forms.

An example would be a younger Holocene sea level revisiting the approximate level previously occupied by a Pleistocene sea level, as commonly seen along tectoni- cally stable shores in the Bahamian Archipelago and Austra- lia. The question thus arises as to which shoreline feature is being classified and to which 'coast' does it belong? Further, in order to comprehend present coasts it is necessary to un- derstand the relevance or impacts of the hinterland on the coast. One possible solution is to follow the suggestion of Mc- GILL (1958) and classify the coastal fringe, a zone about 5- 10 km wide that includes both landscapes and seascapes. The unifying concept of the classification is based on mor- phostructures, which may be large or small and which cut across all taxonomic levels in the system. Because the system is geomorphic, it focuses on the shape (morphology) of land- forms or individual features and provides for consideration of the processes responsible for their formation, age of the forms, and their relationships with adjacent or juxtaposed morphostructures. The main taxonomic levels in the coastal geomorphic clas- sification system summarize as follows: (1) control of coastal morphostructures, (2) morphostructural process types, (3) geodynamic-climatomorphogenic process zones, (4) relief types (morphoregions), (5) morphogenetic relief features, and (6) relief elements and genetically homogeneous surfaces. Each of these main groups is briefly described in what follows (see Table 25), along with indications of subdivision within the main categories. The system thus first considers the lithic competence of the material comprising the coast. Mechanical and chemical fac- tors that affect the stability of rock units are related to ther- mal, abrasion, percussion, and cryoclastic processes (the me- chanical factors) and water-saturation, cementation, and compaction (the chemical factors). Lithic competence is a pri- mary criterion for all coastal rocks, soft and hard, as it is directly responsible for the stability (ease of development and preservation potential) or degradation (physico-chemical breakdown) of coastal forms. Next in importance and closely related to lithic properties and coastal forms are the chro- nometric constraints on the feature. Morphostructural units are separated into broad age groups that progress from youn- gest (less than 100 yrs old) to oldest (more than 1 million years) by orders of magnitude. This grouping, although ar- bitrary, provides for a coastal chronology that is useful for general age comparisons. Many coastal features have been dated by radiometric methods (e.g. coral reefs, beach ridges) and chronometries are available along some well-studied coasts, both contemporary neomorphogenic shores and older (raised or submerged) paleomorphogenic shoreline features (e.g. BLOOM, 1965, 1978; STAPOR, 1975; TAYLOR and STONE, 1996; RINK and PIEPER, 2001; RINK, 2003). Other environ- mental factors that influence the character of the coast in- clude volcanic activity, isostatic adjustment (e.g. neotectonic movements or glacial rebound), eolian deposition, and bio- genic development that results in accumulations of reef cor- als, shell middens, or mangrove muds. In this morphogenetic system, all coasts are broken out into two hierarchical orders that define the most basic types of coast. The allomorphic order embraces most soft rock coasts that are created by marine processes of erosion and deposition. Allomorphic relief forms and types are comprised by mostly uncemented sedimentary materials. Most hard rock coasts belong to the automorphic order. These are pri- mary, self-derived coasts that are formed by magmatic, geo- tectonic, or subaerial processes. Automorphic coasts include terrestrial morphostructures that have been modified by ma- rine processes. Suborders refer to geodynamic and climatomorphogenetic process zones. The bicameral grouping recognizes suborders associated with geodynamic continental margins and clima- tomorphogenic provinces. There are a variety of continental margins, which define broad differences in the structure, form, and outline of coasts, with the Atlantic and Pacific types being well established in the literature. To those coasts that truncate the tectonic grain of the hinterland (transverse coasts) and which run parallel to the structural grain (lon- gitudinal coasts) (after SUESS, 1888) we add taphrogenic and sediment loading (after FAIRBRIDGE, 1992) coasts. These sub- orders incorporate rifted coasts and continental borderlands. The sediment loading suborder embraces large alluvial ac- cumulations associated with basin subsidence. The great del- tas of the world, coastal plans, and partially drowned sedi- mentary basins are characteristic of this suborder. Climate exerts such a strong imprint on coastal develop- ment that the same geomorphic features such as coastal plains, sea cliffs, and beaches have distinctive morphotypes in polar, mid-latitude, and tropical regions (e.g. BIRD and Ho- PLEY, 1969; BUDEL, 1982). Different climatic regimes can also produce characteristic forms in the same rock type; gran- ites on tropical coasts are quite different than granites along Arctic coasts. Another important factor is deep chemical weathering that produces a variety of alterites and hard dur- icrusted residual covers (FINKL, 1994b). Erosion of deeply weathered landscapes brings predominantly kaolinitic clays to the coast whereas sediment transport in arid regions feeds feldspathc sediments to coastal margins. In mid-latitude hu- mid climatic regimes, smectitic-type (montmorillinoid) clays are common erosional products that are transported to coast- al regions (see FAIRBRIDGE and FINKL, 1980). The climate factor is so strong that many researchers recognize a range of climatomorphogenic regions where the morphology of the landscape and its weathering products can be arranged in sequence, for example, from physical weathering in Polar Re- gions to intense chemical weathering in the tropics. The con- tinuum of climatomorphogenic regimes is organized here into nine discrete provinces viz. (1) humid tropical, (2) tropical wet-dry, (3) savanna, (4) tropical-subtropical desert, (5) hu- mid subtropical, (6) humid mesothermal, (7) humid micro- ermal, (8) polar/subpolar, and (9) glaciated. Relief types are grouped into morphoregions that include morphosculpture complexes, as defined by DEMEK (1972) and DEMEK and EMBLETON (1976). These regional units that comprise distinctive and homogeneous assemblages of forms and which are characterized by similar morphology and gen- esis are broken down into mountain (hill), plainland, and val- ley morphostructures. Mountains in contact with the sea form distinctive coasts depending on dominant lithologies or Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="41">206 Finkl geological structure. Plateaus (uplifted plainlands) that are truncated to form coastal cliffs are subdivided, for example, into distinctive limestone, weathered, and volcanic morpho- types. Plainlands at or near present sea level are likewise subdivided but in this case on the basis of climatomorpho- genic zones to give Arctic, mid-latitude, and tropical morpho- types. Similar subdivisions of valleys obtain various types of drowned or partially drowned morphotypes. Continental free- board and relief roughness, the latter based on fractal anal- ysis of surface contours, provide a basis for morphometric analysis and classification at hectometric to kilometric scales. Morphogenetic relief features (macro- and mesomorphos- tructures and their elements) are divided into three groups on the basis of whether they are dominantly erosional (des- tructional), depositional (constructional), or polygenetic pro- cess-forms. The erosional and depositional taxonomic cate- gories are subdivided on the basis of shape, i.e. whether the morphostructures are linear or curvilinear in planform and broken down again on the basis of whether they lie parallel or transverse to the shore. The polygenetic or complex pro- cess-forms essentially boil down to submerged (or partially drowned) landscape features or emerged seascape features. A wide range of morphotypes are recognized for classes of ingressional and egressional relict forms. Examples of sub- marine morphostructures on the inner continental shelf off southeast Florida are given in FINKL and KHALIL (2000) where reef structures, calcareous hardground exposures, in- ter-reefal sedimentary troughs, and bar systems are corre- lated with coastal process zones viz. bioconstructor barriers, para(dia)bathic sediment transport zones, hydrodynamic bar- riers, log-spiral eddies, transverse bars, and coastal ocean process zones. Geomorphic features classified at the lowest level in the proposed scheme are relief elements (RE) and genetically ho- mogeneous surfaces (GHS). RE and GHS units commonly oc- cur in nature at metric to decametric scales and range in the extreme from some tenths of m2 to some km2. These kinds of features (e.g. solution pits, rillen and karren, micro-atolls, honeycombs) are usually mapped at the largest of scales. DISCUSSION The proposed considerations for a new comprehensive scheme (Table 24), that make up a defacto system, do not represent a new classification per se, but rather an integra- tion of many properties that are already included in other systems, descriptions, or analogs. The system is an approxi- mation that has benefited from contract work (YUHR et al., 1997; FINKL et al., 1997), collegial inputs, and suggestions for improvement (see Acknowledgements section). It is thus re- garded as organic, a work in progress that can be modified as new information or insight becomes available. The nested hierarchy is deliberately designed to be open ended so that it can accommodate additions, subtractions, and transforma- tion without destroying the overarching layout. The scheme is a broadly bottom-up approach that moves from specific fea- tures or forms to more inclusive or comprehensive categories viz. relief elements &gt; morphogenetic relief features &gt; relief types &gt; geodynamic-climatomorphogenetic process zones &gt; chronometrically determined morphostructures &gt; lithologi- cally controlled morphostructures. This sequencing thus mi- grates from a simple relief form to a linear or curved shape to a form-producing process to a relief type (mountain, plain, valley) as influenced by plate tectonics and climate, age, and lithology. Descriptions of specific coastal features or shore segments do not necessarily have to follow the outline because scales of observation are variable and therefore categorical levels are flexible. Notes to assist observational criteria are thus provided as guides as in the case of rock type, which can be important at myriametric scales. Geodynamic and climato- morphogenic processes, on the other hand, are operational mostly at megametric scales for regional and continental cov- erage. Some smaller units for local area coverage are best related at metric to decametric scales (e.g. solution pits, lime- stone pinnacles). An example of the flexibility of the system can be illus- trated by walking a southeast Florida beach scarp through the hierarchy. This protolittoral (&lt;100 years old) feature be- longs to the class of erosional linear parabathic morphostruc- tures associated with coastal plain relief in a humid subtrop- ical environment on a semi-stable (or neutral) divergent con- tinental margin containing allomorphic sandy deposits. The complete hierarchical sequence would not normally be given for a small scale morphological feature as in the case of the Linnaean system where genus and species identifiably is nor- mally adequate for most purposes. Related attributes of a fea- ture may be additionally referred to when relevant and war- ranted, however. The overall design of the system is based on the relative or combined influence (power) of materials that affect the char- acter of the coast (Category I) (Table 24). Geological inheri- tance is thus built into the system by incorporating rock type, its durability, and age of the material upon which coastal processes act. Because the coastline, and by inference the coastal zone, always transits preexisting landscapes, sea- scapes, or seabed in response to relative fluctuations in sea level (eustatic or geodynamic changes) it is important in the first instance to consider the nature of the material that is being converted into a coastal feature, as has been recognized in many prior systems (e.g. JOHNSON, 1919; VALENTIN, 1952; OWENS, 1994) (cf Table 24). In this regard, the relegational role of lithologic control is broadly likened to SHEPARD'S (1973) primary and secondary coasts where hard rock costs are regarded as automorphic, because they are primary, and secondary soft rock coasts that are produced by allomorphism (allomorphic coasts) as marine products. The age of morphostructures (Category II) (Table 24) re- lates to the paleogeography of global shorelines, rates of re- treat versus progradation (erodability, preservation poten- tial), and antiquity of the littoral landforms that are in turn related to hypsometry and eustatic sequence orders. The sys- tem thus embraces coastal forms of all ages sensu lato and is not limited to Holocene shores. This is advantageous because most coasts are complexly developed, polygenetic with pa- limpsest features and patterns, as recognized in other sys- tems viz. JOHNSON (1919), COTTON (1952), SHEPARD (1948, 1973) (cfTable 25). Additionally, paleo- or meiolittoral shore- Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="42">Systematic Approaches to Coastal Classification 207 lines and associated morphostructural units could be strand- ed and reside great distances inland from present-day land- sea boundaries (e.g. JOHNSON and LIBBEY, 1997; LIBBEY and JOHNSON, 1997). Plate tectonics and the large-scale coastal morphologies as- sociated with them are embraced at the third categorical lev- el in terms of geodynamic and structural provinces as diver- gent (passive) continental margin (Atlantic Type Coast) and convergent (active) continental margins (Pacific Type Coast), following the lead of INMAN and NORDSTROM (1971), and building on seminal works (e.g. SUESS, 1888; COTTON, 1952; SHEPARD, 1948, 1973) (cf Table 25), with modifications and updates from FAIRBRIDGE (1992, 2004). The climatomorpho- genic provinces are patterned after BUDEL'S (1982) percep- tion and understanding of climatic geomorphology. The fourth categorical level deals (Table 24) with relief types or morphoregions that are major regional morpho- structures or morphosculpture complexes that range from a few tens of kilometers to hundred of kilometers, hence hec- tometric to kilometric scales and larger for regional and sub- regional coverage. Types of mountains, plains, and valleys are modified by the height of continental freeboard and relief roughness, where appropriate. The cliffs of Dover are a good example of a plateau that is truncated by marine erosion to form coastal cliffs. Glacial fjords and fjards or deeply and shallowly incised valleys (e.g. Chesapeake Bay Morphotype) can be modified by terms in Categories I, II, or III as re- quired. These kinds of large, as well as small-scale features noted in Category V, are consistent with types included in other classifications (e.g. JOHNSON, 1919; SHEPARD, 1948, 1973; OWENS, 1994). Morphogenetic relief features (Category V) (Table 24), mac- ro- and mesomorphostructures and their elements occur on the order of a few tens of kilometers and are thus relevant to decametric and hectometric scales for subregional to local coverage. The units are subdivided in terms of erosional (des- tructional), depositional (constructional), or polygenetic (com- plex) process forms. These units make up the vast majorities of coastal forms that are so commonly referred to in the lit- erature. Their morphometry is described in terms of shape and orientation relative to the coast as linear (due to leiom- orphogenesis) or curvilinear (due to scoliomorphogenesis). Diabathic and parabathic modifiers are recognized. Morpho- types are identified for many units as suggested exemplars, which can be changed or added to as more information be- comes available. CONCLUSIONS Over the last century numerous types of coastal classifi- cation have been put forward. These attempts at organizing knowledge in the littoral were mainly been based in the phys- ical sciences, although there are now more numerous biolog- ical classifications for littoral systems and subsystems (e.g. rocky intertidal zones, coastal salt marsh) as habitats, eco- systems, faunal-floral realms or provinces, etc. In a way, it is surprising that there is no comprehensive classification of coastal landforms and yet, on the other hand, it is under- standable because "the coast" is a transitional zone between terrestrial and marine systems to which coastal specialists have laid claim only relatively recently. With increased in- terest in the coastal zone due to population pressures, de- mand for integrated resource management through integrat- ed coastal zone management (ICZM) practices, and recently as littoral battle space (e.g. FINKL, 1997), the time has come for clearer integration of understanding of coastal materials, landforms, processes, and their dynamic interactions. Such perception and appreciation derives from classificatory ef- forts which attempt to organize these factors or parameters into a logical, interrelated, and universal system. Although prior needs for systematization of coastal geo- morphologies were not as pressing as it is now, there are other factors driving the issue today. There are now, for ex- ample, large relational databases and GIS frameworks for many coastal sectors that compile inventories of coastal fea- tures. Remote sensing (multispectral space-borne and hyper- spectral aerial platforms) also brings to the arena a whole new field of data that is synoptically valuable on a range of scales never before possible. So, it is perhaps prudent to con- sider that: (1) the time has come for comprehensive and in- tegrated classification, (2) there exist huge coastal databanks (in analog and digital form), and (3) new techniques are avail- able for classifying the world's shoreline. All that is required is development of a suitable framework that is appropriate for a universal, global system of coastal classification. Its not that previous systems were no good or lacked merit, for the questions to be asked should evolve about purposes and goals of the systems in hand and the kind of information that was available at the time of formulation. Today's com- plicated issues in the coastal zone require sophisticated res- olution; it's a case where preliminary or rudimentary solu- tions no longer meet newer complex demands. In a sense, prior systems of coastal classification are apophoreta-appe- tizers for the main course yet to come. Thus, a new system of coastal classification needs to be developed and it is apro- pos to consider the purpose of the new system and determine exactly what is to be classified. The purpose of this proposal is to organize a smorgasbord of coastal landforms in terms of a multipurpose, comprehensive, and unified classification scheme. The subject of classification is geomorphological units (tax- ons); therefore, following the lead of the IGU Commission on Coastal Survey and Mapping, morphostructures provide the linking theme of the classification system and facilitate tran- sitioning from one taxonomic level to another. Morphostruc- tures exist at all scales within the spectrum of mapping. In addition to the purpose, theme, and units there are (classi- ficatory and mapping) constraints related to the definition of coast and this has to be comprehended in the scheme. To be useful in a broad or universal context, the new system must classify more than the shore- or coastline per se. The system must apply to a "zone" and not a line. The classification pro- cedure must allow for "across-the-shore" variation as well as "along-the-shore" extent, similar to what DOLAN et al. (1972) refer to as the orthogonal approach. LIND (1969) applies a similar approach in his distribution of coastal profile types where cross-shore profiles are given alongshore distributive properties so that disbathic sequences are parabathically Journal of Coastal Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2004</page><page sequence="43">208 Finkl linked. Due to the complexity of antecedence (inheritance) in coastal landforms, the classification system needs to consider a swath of certain dimension along the shore and not just the length and width of a particular landform. Because most coasts are the result of polygenesis (multicyclicity) over a range of time frames, composite classifications are required to consider rather broad areal extents both above and below present sea level along coasts. MCGILL (1958) refers to the area or zone that should be classified as the "coastal fringe" and this is adopted here as a swath along the coast that ex- tends for several kilometers on either side of the shoreline to include subaerial and submarine features. Finally, in addi- tion to being comprehensive and unified, the classification system needs to be open ended so that new information can be added as required. The scheme presented here is prelim- inary and should be considered as a work in progresses. The usefulness or value of a classification system can only be de- termined in the fullness of time by use in the field. And fi- nally, no classification is a completely accurate representa- tion of Nature and, no matter how well conceived and con- structed, the scheme is morphologically both an ontological and phylogenetic approximation of macro- and micro-devel- opmental forms. The contribution offered here is thus an ap- proach or approximation of what is yet to come. Whatever the form of subsequent efforts towards development of a com- prehensive coastal classification scheme, the evolving sys- tems should in one way or another deal with the criteria out- lined here.
