In view of the fact that Morrison is a Black woman writer, two approaches will be given special attention in this paper: the assimilationist one reflecting "larger society" values and stand- ards, and the feminist one mirroring gender-related positions. It will be demon- strated that critics who have lent themselves to the underlying ideologies tend to see problems in Morrison's fiction which become non-existent, if one takes the writer's point of view into consideration, and to ignore others that are raised by the novelist. It will also be shown that some of these critics even attempted to "rewrite" Morrison's texts. I. Toni Morrison has been widely acclaimed by critics and reviewers for her five novels published so far.1 For Song of Solomon she received the prestigious National Book Critics' Circle Award in 1977, and for Beloved the Pulitzer Prize in 1988. Academic interest in Morrison has grown ever since she won her first literary prize. In the light of the great attention given to this black woman writer, it seems surprising though that a body of criticism has evolved in the United States so far, which can hardly be called homogeneous. Whereas some of the causes responsible for the present state of Morrison criticism pertain to the general domain of literary criticism, others must be related to the conditions existing in contemporary U.S. American society. Thus if critics practise name dropping for self-aggrandizement by mentioning famous writers of the past, or the names of others who have contributed 1 The Bluest Eye, Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, New York 1970; Sula, Knopf, New York 1974, Song of Solomon, Knopf, New York 1977; Tar Baby, Knopf, New York 1981, Beloved, Knopf, New York 1987.</page><page sequence="2">110 Arìbert Schroeder to contemporary critical theory2 rather than to provide fresh insights into Morrison's fiction through comparative analysis or by application of "new" theories, such practice ought to to be condemned as much as overextension of thesis, forced analogy, or false use of terminology, which also occur in criticism of her works. Among the deficits having social causes, those will be given special attention that are due ideological approaches followed by several critics. These approaches are linked to "system[s] of beliefs publicly expressed,"3 which have evolved in the larger society on one hand and its minorities on the other. In this metacriticism, two groups of critics, those subscribing to assimilationist and/or feminist approaches respectively, will be given special attention. Theorists of the social sciences have discovered that empiricists follow an assimilationist approach, when they generalize patterns extrapolated from their subjects' behaviour by applying the terms "ethnic convergence" and "ethnic divergence" to it.4 Two aspects are characteristic of such a method. One is that a value judgment is included in this seemingly descriptive use of the two complementary terms just mentioned. Accordingly, the behaviour of minority subjects resembling that of larger society members is seen positively, whereas behaviour differing from it is viewed negatively. And the other aspect is that only the standards of larger society have validity for such social scientists. In view of these findings, it is suggested here that white "assimilationist" critics5 of Black literature, and Blacks who have internalized their views, tend to analyze Black fiction from a (white) "main- stream" perspective. In their unwillingness to allow a special creative focus to Black writers, such assimationists try to define for them what they consider to be "universal" or "ethnic" with regard to themes discussed, values expressed, or aestetic standards followed. In the eyes of such "larger society" critics, for example, fictional treatment of white racial oppression in the United States by Black writers is regarded as "protest literature", no matter whether it deals with life in the rural South and/or the urban ghettoes of the North, or "Black survival" during slavery. Compared to "mainstream literature" such fiction 2 E.G. Henry James, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner; Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida. 3 F.X. Sutton et al., The American Business Creed, Cambridge, Mass., 1956, p. 2. 4 Joseph Hraba, American Ethnicity, Itasca, Illinois, 1979, p. 171f. 5 Ishmael Reed identifies "assimilationists" in the "East Coast intellectuals" who determined during the "Modernist movement" what was significant in black writing," who promoted writers like Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin, and decided who was to be the Black writer. He ascribes similar powers to the "third generation of New York intellectuals," e.g. Susan Brownmiller and Gloria Steinem. Cf. Mel Watkins, "An Interview with Ishmael Reed," Southern Review 21 (1985), (603-614), p. 604, 605. He also deals with this problematic in his novel Reckless Eyeballing of 1986, as John A. Williams did before him in his novels The Man Who Cried I Am of 1967 and Click Song of 1982.</page><page sequence="3">AN AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN WRITER AND HER REVIEWERS/CRITICS 1 1 1 is viewed as being too "one-sided" or too "narrow." The bias of such critics also shows in that they give recognition to Black writers only if they believe they can demonstrate that the latter imitated the style of white ones, e.g. William Faulkner or Ernest Hemingway. And innovative writing techniques, if they cannot be "exposed" as imitations of white writers like James Joyce, are rejected for being too "complicated" or experimental."6 When a Black writer is given praise at all, significantly, he is compared to other Blacks only even if contemporary white novelists have covered similar ground. Not surprisingly, therefore, such assimilationist critics allow second place to Black fiction at best. The assimilationist approach will first be documented in the criticism of two white males, Stanley Crouch and James Coleman. In his review of Morrison's novel Beloved,7 Crouch claims that Morrison produced another piece of "protest pulp fiction" whose style "has dominated so many renditions of Afro-American life since [Richard Wright's] Native Son." The central idea of this fiction, according to Crouch, was formulated by James Baldwin, who described the downtrodden as saintly: "Blessed are the victims, the new catechism taught, for their suffering has illuminated them, and they shall lead us to the light, even as they provide magnets for our guilt." When the reviewer outlines the course, which "racial letters" took in his view, he accuses Morrison of two things which she failed(!) to do. One is that like Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones, and Alice Walker, she did not speak out against Stokely Carmichael, LeRoi Jones, Eldridge Cleaver, and H. Rap Brown, i.e. "against the wrongheadedness of a black politics that mixed a romanticized African past with separatist ideas, virulent anti-white racism, and threats to overthrow the government of the United States 'by any means necessary'." And the other accusation is that in her sections about the sufferings of African slaves during the "middle passage", Morrison, like "many other Afro-Americans, fails to mention the involvement of Africans in the slave trade in her "equation of injustices". After labeling Beloved a "blackface [sic!] holocaust novel" and suggesting that in her dedication of the book to "Sixty Million and more," Morrison only wanted to top the holocaust of the Jews, Crouch concludes that "Beloved fails to rise to tragedy because it shows no sense of the timeless and unpredictable manifestations of evil that preceded and followed American slavery, of the gruesome ditches in the human spirit that prefigure all injustice." As one can see, two ideological strands, a "mainstream" and a "white ethnic" one, have been combined in Crouch's review. Though his arguments mainly belong in the domains of African and US. American history, they 6 E.G. Melvin M. Kelly's Dunfords Travels Everywheres, John A.

In view of the thematic aspect one may ask though, why Black (women) writers cannot be as free in selection of their subject matter as their white female of male counterparts, even if, like Morrison, they attempt to give a fictional answer to the question inscribed in the walls of a West African slave castle, "Who will tell of our Holocaust?"8 But outside the literary field, too, one might argue, as another reviewer does, that Beloved ought to be regarded as an important book because it is, among other things, "about the devastating cost of slavery, our great historical trauma, and the racist shadow it continues to cast on the United States."9 Less damaging for the resulting interpretation is James Coleman's assimi- lationist approach in his essay on Tar Baby. In support of his thesis that this novel is a partial failure, Coleman argues:10 If Morrison had developed Tar Baby beyond the level of its superficial ending, it would be a work that confronted the possibility that Black writers must break the mold of Black novels that show Black characters successfully integrating and living by clearly defined Black folk values in the context of a white world. Conversely, Tar Baby might have shown that Black people must become in- creasingly sophisticated, in the white Western sense, and not exhibit perceptible Black folk values, as Son does. One can hardly fail to see that Coleman, like Crouch before him, tries to give a "prescription" to Morrison from a white perspective. But why, one may ask, must this Black woman writer offer solutions to the problems she discusses in her fiction? Perhaps she does not see any from her point of view. Besides, why can her novels not be open-ended, as she wishes them to be for reasons of her own? Had Coleman not better define what he means by "integration" and "the context of a white world" before he gives them as aims to Black writers, even more so since quite of few of them, including Toni Morrison, have voiced their misgivings about Integration?"11 And with an eye on the issue of "universality" the critic may be asked, how "clearly defined Black folk values" are expected to function in such a context. Do they eventually disappear, co-exist with white ones in a white-determined context, or do they contribute to definition of a new context which has validity for whites and Blacks? 8 Marcia Ann Gillespie , "Toni Morrison's Beloved Out of Slavery's Inferno," Ms., November 16, 1987, 66, 68. 9 David L.

In her eyes, 'lhe operative assumption [...] is that the black cultural heritage of 'ancient earthly wisdom' and formal education are mutually exclusive." In support of her views, Edelberg identifies education in The Bluest Eye as a white middle-class value and contrasts it with the "lusty funkiness" and the "godlike freedom" which Blacks lose if they seek it. Whereas Cholly Breedlove represents the latter quality, three prostitutes become "funky ladies" for Edelman. Geraldine, on the other hand, is one of those Blacks who "have taken up white middle-class values and have thereby lost their funkiness." The critic seems to be particularly incensed by Morrison's negative views about such 'brown girls', as her exaggerated collocations demonstrate: 'To 'learn how to do the white man's work' is necessarily to lose something very special, and like a traitor to play whitey's games and become an oreo or a coconut." But 'lhe arch-villain of The Bluest Eye," according to Edelberg, is Elihue Micah Whitcomb," who for a short period has even had an academic education. The critic's conclusion about the characters cited by her is that 'lhe omniscient narrator denounces educated, propertied blacks, applauds Mrs. Breedlove's funkiness, Cholly's freedom, extols the whores, and finds a major cause of Soaphead Church's twisted mind in his academic aspirations." Unfortunately, Edelberg's dichotomies invalidate her argument because they do not stand up to closer examination. And her analysis of individual characters cited in support of her argument must be called invalid, because it was made outside the context of white racism. In The Bluest Eye, for example, Morrison heavily draws on psychiatry in order to give expression to the destructive impact of racial oppression on Blacks. Accordingly, Cholly Breedlove develops a scapegoat syndrome, a special case of the displaced feelings syndrome, before he becomes 'dangerously free' and commits his terrible deeds against members of his own family. Cholly is first victimized by his parents, e.g. his own mother shortly after his birth, as Edelberg correctly points out, before he falls victim to white Southerners who force him as an adolescent to behave like the stereotyped "coon" during his sexual initiation. Remarkably, Edelberg does not discuss this episode, though the narrator derives Breedlove's scapegoat syndrome from it {BE, 136f., 42). His "Freedom", therefore, cannot be studied in isolation, uncon- 12 Cynthia Dubin Edelberg, "Morrison's Voices: Formal Education, the Work Ethic, and the Bible," American Literature 58 (1986), 217-237.</page><page sequence="6">114 Aribert Schroeder vincing as Morrison's monocausal explanation for Breedlove's behaviour may be.13 The three prostitutes, on the other hand, are nobody's victims. They have become what they are of their own volition. But they are not Edelberg's "funky ladies" either, if one goes by the narrator's definition of "funkiness" (BE 77), which the critic misses in the text. For both these reasons, therefore, they cannot serve as examples supporting Edelberg's thesis. Geraldine,14 finally, must definitely be counted among the 'brown girls' who, due to the values of the work ethic, 'the careful development of thrift, patience, high morals, and good manners', have got rid of their funkiness. But Edelberg fails to see that Morrison has developed this character from a double perspective. Seen from the perspective of white society, Geraldine and other Black women of her kind have put all their effort into assimilating to it. Despite this, however, they do not reap the professional rewards due to them in view of their educational background, because 'homemaking for whites and teaching to Black children are the only positions open to them' (BE, 77). In the light of these findings, therefore, Blacks, like Geraldine of her husband Louis, are trying to become assimilated to a white world, which is discriminating against them. Viewed from the internal perspective of the Black world, the price Blacks pay for this kind of assimilation is even heavier. Analogous with criticism aimed at similar "brown girls", the narrative voice hints, for example, that Geraldine does not enjoy sexual intercourse with her husband. And instead of loving her son, Louis jr., whom she tries to model after white precepts externally and internally, Geraldine gives all her love to a cat - which arouses her sexually (BE, 791.). As a result of this, the boy, like his mother, develops a displaced feelings syndrome in combination with a scapegoat syndrome. Being unable to hate his mother, he first turns his hatred upon the cat and later on the 'nigger[s]' among the black children, e.g. Pecóla Breedlove, whom Geraldine hates too, because they are not "colored" (BE, 81). As one can see, the narrator of The Bluest Eye wants the reader to understand that the results of internalisation of white values and standards of beauty in the presence of white racism are hatred of other Blacks and disturbed social relations with them. 13 It disagrees with Cholly's state of a "bad man" (BE, 147) and his courtship of, and early married life with, Pauline. Their relationship runs afoul only after they have arrived in the North. 14 Geraldine's name points to a black stereotype. Cf. Toni Morrison, "What the Black Woman Thinks About Women's Lib," The New York Times Magazine, August 22, 1971, (14-15+), p. 15; Aribert Schroeder, "Frauenbilder und die afro-amerikanische Identitäts- problematik in den Romanen von Toni Morrison," Frauenforschung 3 (1985), (19-41), p. 27f.</page><page sequence="7">AN AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN WRITER AND HER REVIEWERS/CRITICS 1 15 Another adult example of an "educated" Afro-American is Elihue Micah Whitcomb, called 'Soaphead Church.' When Edelberg summarizes Whit- comb's life by drawing on a certain passage of the novel {BE, 152), she makes him resemble the stereotyped "shiftless negro", which disagrees with the writer's intention. For Morrison's narrator makes subtle allusions to the impact of white racism on Whitcomb's life, as he does in a parallel passage, which is a summary of Whitcomb's professional life during the Thirties (BE, 157-58): Elihue, not knowing where to look, was thrown back on his own devices, and 'found' himself quite unable to earn money. He began to sink into a rapidly fraying gentility, punctuated with a few white-collar occupations available to black people regardless of their noble bloodlines in America: desk clerk at a colored hotel in Chicago, insurance agent, traveling salesman for a cosmetics firm catering to blacks. He finally settled in Lorain, Ohio, in 1936, palming himself off as a minister and inspiring awe with the way he spoke English. But as she has done before, Morrison then goes on to relate what Blacks, who have been affected by white racism, are (capable of) doing to other members of their community. By combining the types of West Indian Black and "Black aristocrat" in Whitcomb, both groups hold unique positions among Afro-Americans, the novelist discusses issues particularly painful to it (BE, 154f„ 1 63f . ) . The effects of what these fictional West Indian Blacks have practised are dramatized in Whitcomb himself, who is the perverse descendant of a ■fluke' (BE, 155). As his name and nickname indicate (BE, 154), 15 this black character has internalized standards of white beauty too. In addition, he has made white American conceptions of personal hygiene his own. Thus Whitcomb hates decay around himself. It is for this reason, for example, that he treats an old, mangy dog with cruelty. But due to his exaggerated sense of cleanliness, Whitcomb also becomes unfit for intimate sexual relations with adults, e.g. his first girl friend Velma (BE, 153). Whitcomb's "perversion" is revealed in his love of "worn objects', which can be interpreted as a displaced feelings syndrome: 'It was as though his disdain of human contact had converted itself into a craving for things humans had touched. The residue of the human spirit smeared on the inanimate objects was all he could withstand of humanity' (BE, 153). Contrary to Edelberg's claim that 'lhe narrator fails to censure him [Whit- comb]" for his odd behaviour towards small girls, Morrison condemns his behaviour too by giving Whitcomb a "voice" being limited and self-revealing in the paragraphs criticized. He certainly is a pervert in Morrison's eyes too (cf. BE, 167), but one who has become what he is due to the impact of white racism on his life. 15 The former is a pun on "white comb" ans the first part of the latter, 'Soaphead,' an allusion to the act of "processing" (BE, 154), by which some Blacks chemically straighten their hair in order to make it look "white."</page><page sequence="8">116 Aribert Schroeder Also in her discussion of educated characters taken from the other novels, Edelberg pays little attention to the racial context, in which Morrison has developed her characters from a double perspective. In Sula, for example, "maiming" is frequently referred to with regard to Black characters that have been maimed in the white world, like Shadrack, who are maiming themselves, like the protagonist Sula and her grandmother Eva Peace, and who are frequently maiming other Blacks in return. Similarly, in Song of Solomon, the social cultural consequences of white racism on Blacks are dramatized, among other things, in First Corinthian Dead's life. When Corinthians tries to emancipate herself from her Black middle class family, she starts to work as a cleaner for the 'State Poet Laureate,' a white woman, though she holds a liberal arts degree from Bryn Mawr ( SoS , 190ff.). This would be "an odd job indeed" for a person with her educational background, as Edelberg suggests, were there not the problem that this black woman's education is disregarded by those in the white world controlling the jobs available to Blacks. As it is, Corinthians can only choose among the positions open to her. But her educational background turns out to be an impediment in the Black world too, for example regarding her relations with black men. As most of them have been less educated than herself, they are given a lower social status. And even those who do enjoy the same status, e.g. the Black professionals, consider Corinthians "overqualified" because they can only see her in the role of housewife. In support of her thesis, Edelberg posits Jadine Childs's sophistication in Tar Baby, the latter holds a Fine Arts degree from the Sorbonne, against William Green's "primitivism". However, in doing this, the critic has not only taken into consideration just one among several possible dichotomies, but one, in addition, that is played down by the narrator himself, when he informs the reader that Green briefly attended A &amp; M College in Florida earlier in his life and that he successfully takes the required college entrance tests, when Jadine insists that her lover continue his academic education (TB, 265, 268f.). Still, Jadine and "Son" are more than just two contrast figures with the negative traits being vested in one of them only. If solutions to Jadine and 'Son's' problems are offered in Tar Baby at all, the novelist seems to look for them in a combination of both characters' positive traits rather than those of one figure only. But Edelberg has also ignored the racial context with its "neo-colonial" implications in Tar Baby. When William "Son" Green calls his lover Jadine an 'educated nitwit' {TB, 267), it is because, in his view, she does not know enough about the position of Black men and women in societies controlled by U.S. Americans. Though Jadine Childs is not the 'Tar Baby' Green sees in her (TB, 273), she can to some extent be regarded as 'lhe product" of a former candy manufacturer, Valerian Street, who, together with his wife Margaret, lives</page><page sequence="9">AN AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN WRITER AND HER REVIEWERS/CRITICS 1 1 7 in retirement on a Caribbean Island. Not only does Jadine owe her own education to Street, but she also means to draw on his finances in her plans of first establishing a fashion business and, later, of having her lover William Green obtain an academic degree ( TB , 265, 271). At the same time, however, she does not seem terribly concerned about her 'em- ployer/patron['s]' welfare {TB, 89). Unlike her aunt, Ondine Childs, Jadine does not understand either that Street will always be a 'master" {TB, 281), 18 or perhaps the modernized version of a benign slaveholder, a character Morrison has developed more fully in her most recent novel Beloved. Thus Jadine's privileged position of a 'guest' in the Streets' home, in which her own aunt and uncle are waiting on the owners and herself as servants {TB, 265), 17 depends on the "benevolence" of this man, and not on her education. And she also fails to understand that as a coloured fashion model she depends on white men as well, because it is they who will "buy" her only as long as they are attracted to her, or her image has a market value for them. Age, then, is not the only factor imperilling Jadine's glamorous modeling career {TB, 269f.). If one passes Edelberg's arguments about Morrison's "educated" black characters and their counterparts in review, it becomes apparent that her thesis that "formal education for blacks is destructive," is not supported by the dichotomies given by her, because Morrison either did not employ them in her novels, or in more subtle ways than the critic accepts them to be. Her argument is further invalidated by the fact that Edelberg, from her assimilationist perspective, has completely ignored the context of white racism in her analysis. Assimilationist approaches regarding the novel Tar Baby can also be ex- trapolated from the reviews and critical essays of Pearl Bell, Webster Schott, and Audrey Vinson. In her review article, which is in some ways a reaction to a profile written on Toni Morrison by Jean Strouse,18 Bell gives a lengthy introduction on autobiographical writings, her "ruminations". When one has been lead to believe that the critic will accuse Morrison of being too autobiographical, she argues that "the tone of the first two19 is intensely personal - not because the fictional story is modeled on the writer's life, but because the feelings and opinions attributed to their invented 16 Cf. Morrison's own statement: "He is the center. He's not the main character, but he certainly is the center of the world. I mean, white men run it." Cf. also Ruas, op. cit., p. 225, 228, Nellie McKay.

Ralph Reckley, "On Looking into Morrison's Tar Baby," Amid Visions and Revisions of Poetry and Criticism on Literature and the Arts, ed. Burney J. Hollis, Baltimore 1985, (132-138), p. 134. 18 Pearl K. Bell, "Self-Seekers," Commentary, August, 1981, 56-60; cf. Strouse, op. cit., 52-57. 19 The other novel discussed by Bell is Francine du Plessix Gray's World Without End.</page><page sequence="10">118 Aribert Schroeder creatures have the ring of a message." It apparently concerns the search 'lhe pursuit of the authentic self." Bell's verbal attack is opened with the following statement: The life depicted in Toni Morrison's earlier novels drew its strength from her flawless recollection of a cherished and painful past. Tar Baby is set not on the writer's native ground but on a French Island in the Caribbean where she, too, is only a tourist, and the novel seems to have been designed more as a vehicle for bitter judgments than as a reflective rendering of memory.20 And she goes on to state: This may account for its disjointed tone, its florid language, and the incongruity of its parts: a lush tropic locale; a gorgeously romantic and doomed love story; a melodramatic family scandal; and the harsh indictment of white civilization over it all. Bell's interpretation of Valerian Street, "he is hard to place in her [Morrison's] universe," and her characterisation of Strouse's article as "cover-story hype," indicate that only the last point of her judgment truly occupies her. Not surprisingly, therefore, she observes about William Green: "In an unrelenting tirade which summons up memories of the black power assaults on white America in the 60's and which puts no distance between character and author, Son pours out his wrath on the white barbarians." And Morrison's feelings about Jadine she characterizes as follows: "It soon becomes clear that she has little sympathy with Jadine's longing to get out of her black skin and be 'only the person inside,' for such dreams of self-realization are an offense against the race and herself." Bell's conclusion is that "though Miss Morrison tries to dramatize the lover's irreconcilable views, one senses a good deal of ambivalence and evasiveness beneath her uncompromising racial severity." Bell's review of Tar Baby not only gives evidence of the critic's assimilationist position, but it also serves as an example of forced analogy and twisted argument. Webster Schott, one of the reviewers of Tar Baby ,21 regards it as a "novel of ideas", in which Morrison suggests "that blacks seek ways to hate whites, that black people cannot be fully human on white values, that integration is another way of control, that physical prowess is embedded in black masculinity." Schott has great misgivings about Morrison's characters. With regard to Son and Jadine he claims, for example, that Morrison is fascinated by Son, "because he personifies freedom" and functions as the 'lhe official black male." At the same time, he seems to be biased in favour of the assimilated character Jadine: "Would Jadine drop 25 years of rearing, education, and conscience for a semi-literate she knew two weeks and slept with, perhaps twice?" He seems disturbed by the "stereotyped marriage of Valerian and Margaret Street," but not by the at least equally stereotyped 20 Morrison explains her own choices in McKay, "Interview," op. cit., p. 417. 21 Webster Schott, "Toni Morrison: Tearing the Social Fabric," The Washington Post Book World , March 22, 1981, 1, 2.</page><page sequence="11">AN AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN WRITER AND HER REVIEWERS/CRITICS 1 1 9 "ancient black servant couple," Ondine and Sydney Childs, who at the end of the novel "sense the ground shifting under them and look into Social Security," nor by Valerian Street's "apple-stealing black laundry-woman and yardman, a couple of New York - Haitian outcasts." In Schott's view, "logic takes flight" in Tar Baby. To believe Toni Morrison's characters, isn't to believe their dramatic behavior. They are real people - in a story. The reason we can't credit their behaviour is because, except for the most minor of figures, their actions are determined by Morrison's convictions, not their histories. The critic's positive bias for the white world and his negative one against the black world is obvious. One hardly needs to point out that he manipulated details regarding the coloured washerwomen Thérèse and the servant Sydney. As Schott cynically suggests, the latter, for example, does continue in his job, for example, - however with an important difference: He insists that he and his wife now be treated as human beings in return for working for the Streets as servants (TB, 289). This gives a new quality to their relationship indeed, as the critic senses too. Unfortunately, Schott's bias weakens his argument about Morrison's "ideas", for her "ideology" expressed in Tar Baby, as far as it affects the literary merits of this novel, is worthy of more critical attention than it has received so far. Audrey L. Vinson's paper on Tar Baby22 can be seen as an example of overextension of thesis. This Black critic, if one goes by the biographical details given about her on the back cover, tries to develop several analogies between Morrison's novel and a "classical" English poet's creation, John Milton's Paradise Lost. Thus she suggests that "Morrison's novel vividly depicts a terrestrial paradise," in which William Green acts as "a kind of universal son" who is "symbolic of the Son of Man and Son of God." The home of the Streets on Isle des Chevaliers "is both a garden and a cross symbolizing at once a prelapsarian and postlapsarian state." It also functions as a "microcosm, a little world representative of the larger world." In her argument, Vinson does not only vacílate between the Streets' "house" and their "greenhouse," she also employs the term natural habitat in a misleading sense. She suggests, for example, that Margaret Street and the Childses had been evicted from their natural habitats to come at Valerian Street's bidding to a land with which they are not in harmony." Ironically, the servant couple live in the Black ghetto of Baltimore, before they follow Valerian Street to Philadelphia (TB, 59, 124).23 But this critic also fails to demonstrate convincingly that Morrison's animistic and anthropomorphic 22 Audrey L. Vinson, "Garden Metaphor and Christian Symbolism in Tar Baby," Explorations, ed. Jones and Vinson, op. cit., 115-124. 23 For the irony lying in the image Sydney Childs has of himself as a 'Philadelphia Negro' - this is an allusion to a study made by W.E.B. DuBois -, cf. Susan Willis, "Eruptions of Funk: Historicizing Toni Morrison," Black American Literature Forum 16 (1982), p. 36.</page><page sequence="12">1 20 Aribert Schroeder elements, which she employs to suggest intimate relations of some of her characters with a spiritual world and nature, were derived from Milton's Paradise Lost. Though Morrison, no doubt, studied the poem in one of her graduate courses at Cornell University, or at an earlier date perhaps, a more probable point of departure seems to be the "African cosmology" she has read.24 Son may be christlike in some aspects, as Vinson suggests. Yet his role at l'Arbre de la Croix can still be interpreted differently. One critic holds, for example, that William Green is a "catalyst",25 who forces people to face the truth about themselves and their relations with others. This view ties in with another one set forth here, in which William Green is seen as (a personification) of the "Voodoo god" Legba on one hand, and as a Voodoo initiate, together with his lover Jadine,26 on the other. Though little attention has been given to this level of interpretation so far, the ramifications of Voodooism in Tar Baby cannot be explored here. On the whole, Vinson's arguments, in which she relates Tar Baby to Paradise Lost, are hardly convincing. Interestingly, Morrison, by drawing on "hoodooistic" elements, has attempted to include "Black Doubletalk" in her novel. When it succeeds, Blacks give a meaning to the linguistic signs employed by them, which differs from the one whites give to them. However in our times, there exists no guarantee any longer that all Black readers, or Black critics for that matter, are still conversant with the socio-cultural context required for understanding such doubletalk. II. An impressive number of insights has been provided by critics who analyze Morrison's fiction from the women's perspective. In several instances, how- ever, such criticism becomes less forceful, particularly when, somewhat dogmatically, it is based on narrow versions of a feminist ideology and/or a lesbian one. Deborah E. McDowell highlights some of the problems arising from such approaches for women's analysis of Black literature.27 By drawing on Annette Kolodny, for example, she warns feminist critics "against reading literature as though it were polemic because they might find themselves virtually rewriting a text, ignoring certain aspects of plot or characterization, or oversimplifying the action to fit our 'political' thesis." And with regard to lesbianism she points out that "one of the major tasks ahead of Black feminist critics who write from a lesbian perspective is to define lesbianism and lesbian literature precisely." 24 Pepsy Charles, "An Interview with Toni Morrison," Nimrod 22 (1977), (43-51), p. 47.

Son attracts her like a magnet, but she can't fit into his life." And alluding to Jadine's coat, made from the skins of baby seals, - a present from a white lover -, Lydon holds that "the recurrence of such violent images underscores the theme of racism, and its parallel to sexism. Jadine is trapped by both." Though both terms, doubtlessly, have some validity for an interpretation of this novel, they must be limited to Jadine's relations with white men, who control her economically and socially. But they cannot be applied to her relationship with William Green, save indirectly. Thus Son sketches Jadine's actual and future situation in the white world in categories of racism. And Jadine views her relationship with him through her own sexuality only, which can be regarded as a kind of reverse sexism, because Son is "objectified" by such an attitude ( TB , 121, 187, 294).29 Polemical criticism against men, i.e. a "criticism of the phallus",30 which is based on physical notions of gender, prevails in Madonne M. Miner's essay on The Bluest Eye.31 In it she analyzes the rape of Percola Breedlove by her father, Cholly, by drawing on the Philomela and Persephone myths as told by Ovid, Homer, and others. In the eyes of Miner, "men, potential rapists, assume presence, language, and reason as their particular province. Women, potential victims, fall prey to absence, silence, and madness." Her key term is "penetration." In the "See the Cat" section of the novel, Louis, jr., 'Ihe unloving black boy", throws a black cat at Pecóla and then shuts her into a room of his home. According to Miner, "Pecóla immediately responds to this unexpected penetration by sucking in her breath; metaphorically she draws herself inward." Instead of asking herself about the psychological implications of Junior's act of violence in the light of the boy's relations with his mother Geraldine, or for Pecóla, when a black cat with blue eyes is thrown at her, Miner has apparently preferred to model her interpretation of this episode analogous with the rape scene, in which the narrator compares Pecola's reaction to her father's rape of her in terms of a deflating circus balloon (BE, 150). Another forced analogy concerns the lengthening of Cholly's 28 Susan Lydon, "What's an Intelligent Woman To Do?," The Village Voice, July 1-7, 1981, 40-41. 29 For Morrison's views cf. Ruas, op. cit., p.229. 30 As a paraphrase of Ellman's term "phallic criticism", this is a reversal of the meaning intended by her. Cf. Mary Ellman, Thinking About Women, New York 1968, 28-54. 31 Madonne M. Miner, "Lady No Longer Sings the Blues: Rape, Madness, and Silence in The Bluest Eye," Conjuring: Black Women, Fiction, and Literary Tradition, eds. Marjorie Pryse and Hortense J. Spillers, Bloomington, Indiana, 1985, 176-191.</page><page sequence="14">1 22 Arìbert Schroeder penis and the tightness of Pecola's vagina. Miner comments: "Thus, on a literal level, Cholly expands as Pecóla contracts.". The dichotomies Miner operates with here do not even fit in the case of Cholly Breedlove and his daughter. If "madness" must be related to Pecóla, can "reason" be related to the former? Or is it not rather "unreason" which determines his behavior to quite some extent? Though she seems somewhat ambivalent in this matter, Toni Morrison has drawn Cholly as a male character who, after initially "breeding love," only breeds hatred later in his life. Cholly's rape, it seems, can also be seen as an act of perverted, or "inverted,"32 love (cf. BE, 149, 189). His attempt to practice 'tenderness;' 'protectiveness,' and 'politeness' towards his daughter, results in sexual desire in Breedlove's 'befuddled brain': 'he wanted to fuck her - tenderly" (BE, 189). This sentence, incidentally, immediately precedes the quote given by the critic in support of her ex- pansion/contraction thesis analyzed above. Miner's myth analysis, it seems, would considerably gain in value if it were freed from its polemical elements based on a physical conception of gender. Due to their feminist stance, Jane S. Bakerman and Cynthia Davis, too, misinterpret certain characters in Song of Solomon. In an otherwise infor- mative analysis of Morrison's novels, Bakerman,33 for example, does not quite bear justice to First Corinthians of Song fo Solomon and her lover Porter, when she concludes that "the fact remains that to live with Porter, she must subjugate herself utterly. For the careful reader, this compromise calls into serious question the ultimate worth of Corinthian's choice." But is there no worth in Corinthians's development from initially seeing her lover Porter, whose name signals his low social status, as a type, to accepting him as an individual, whom she can love? Both, First Corinthians and Porter, have come a long way before they are able to face each other as true human beings. Thus, initially, Corinthians is burdened with inter- nalised standards adapted from the white middle class, and Porter has to carry the burden of being a member of the 'Seven Days,' who define their (negative) identity by reacting to white racist murders by randomly assas- sinating an equivalent number of whites. As Corinthians's life, contrary to what Bakerman suggests, is neither determined nor controlled by Porter, their relationship succeeds, as far as it is outlined in the novel, despite her brother and father's attempts of having it terminated. This female character, therefore, cannot be cited as a case in point for Bakerman's view that Morrison "joins her basic theme [of beauty and love] with the initiation motif" 32 Jacqueline de Weever, "The Inverted World of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye and Sula," College Language Association Journal 20 (1979), (402-414), p. 407; cf. also Barbara Christian, "The Contemporary Fables of Toni Morrison," Black Women Novelists: The Development of a Tradition, 1892-1976, Westport, Connecticut, 1980, p. 150f. 33 Jane S. Bakerman, "Failures of Love: Female Initiation in the Novels of Tom Morrison," American Literature Forum 18 (1984), 150-154.</page><page sequence="15">AN AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN WRITER AND HER REVIEWERS/CRITICS 1 23 in her novels, and that 'lhe initiation experiences, trying and painful as they are, fail." Cynthia A. Davis, on the other hand, voices criticism of the female characters in Song of Solomon, in particular Hagar and Pilate, in her essay:34 From first to last, women exist for Milkman, and in the plot development, as functions: mother, wife, lover, sister. [...] we understand Hagar, for example, as a subject in the sense that we see her point of view, but ultimately her story is subsumed in Milkman's search for male models. Thus she regards Pilate, who is "Milkman's" aunt, as a iemale guide figure", who is not heroic: "While she embodies Morrison's values, she is not the complete hero that Milkman is, for she lacks his recognition of meaning. By contrast to his final state, she seems intuitive, personal, and rather passive." Davis finds 'this distinction bothersome because it comes so close to the old active-man/passive-woman stereotype." In conclusion, she states: Morrison's women can free themselves, like Sula, and be self-defined and disconnected; they can come close to a heroic life. But to serve the heroic integrative function, they need a new myth, in which women too are central. Davis looks forward to the day when Morrison will write about the female mode of heroism. As one can see, Davis not only employs ex nihilo arguments, when she points out what Morrison failed to do as a (Black) woman writer, but she also tries to "rewrite the text" when she suggests a completely new focus for Morrison's novel, in which the latter happens to be concentrating on the initiation story of "Milkman" Dead.35 Morrison's novel, Sula, has been singled out for interpretation from a lesbian perspective by Barbara Smith.36 In her view, Sula is a lesbian novel due to the emotions expressed, the definition of female character, and the way in which the politics of heterosexuality are portrayed in the novel. According to Smith, Morrison also gives evidence of her "consistently critical stance towards the heterosexual institutions of male/female relationships, marriage, and the family." Of Morrison's novel, Sula, no doubt, best lends itself to such an interpretation. There are the unique friendship of Sula and Nel, on which both their maturation depends, the failed marriages of Eve and BoyBoy, or Nel and Jude, and the dysfunctions revealed in the Peace and Wright families. However, Sula and Nel's friendship must be counted among the failures 34 Cynthia A. Davis, "Self, Society, and Myth in Toni Morrison's Fiction," Contemporary Literature 23 (1982), 323-342. 35 For Morrison's own views regarding these characters cf. Toni Morrison, "Rootedness: The Ancestor as Foundation," Black Women Writers (1950-1980), ed. Mai Evans, Garden City, New York, 1984, 339-345. 36 Barbara Smith, "Towards a Black Feminist Criticism," Conditions: Two 1 (October, 1977), 25-44.</page><page sequence="16">1 24 Aribert Schroeder too, because it comes to an end after Sula's seduction of Jude. And Nel discovers the value of this friendship for herself only after Sula has been dead for several years, i.e. at the end of the novel. Furthermore, Morrison essentially keeps this friendship between Nel and Sula at the spiritual level. On the physical one, their orientation is heterosexual, and the novelist's emphasis is on sharing, as in the playful acting out of sexual intercourse in the episode preceding the accidental drowning of Chicken Little (S, 57f.), which also has ritual implications, Sula and Nel's adult reminiscences about their sexual experiences as adolescents (S, 91), or their discussion of Sula's past fornication with Nel's husband (S, 130). The ideological corset, which Smith imposes on this fiction, therefore, turns out to be too narrow for it.37 Though Toni Morrison has resisted attempts so far of being claimed as a writer of colour and/or gender, refusing to be affiliated with a Black women's tradition or the feminist movement even,38 one may ask, whether critics were able to trace feminist elements in her fiction. Stanly Crouch, for example, raises the accusation that in Beloved the novelist "perpetually interrupts her narrative with maudlin ideological commercials," that Betoved was "designed to placate sentimental feminist ideology, and to make sure that the vision of black woman as the most scorned and rebuked of the victims doesn't weaken."39 Though this criticism seems exaggerated, one is surprised to note that in the context of white racism established in Beloved, Morrison celebrates a Black-white alliance of women by dealing with literary types. As a slave refugee, the protagonist Sethe, for example, meets the "poor white trash" woman Amy Denver who first saves her life and then assists her in childbirth (S, 84f.). And elsewhere in the novel, and abolitionist woman, Miss Bodwin, is drawn as a white "do-gooder." This strategy even results in certain inconsistencies. Thus the home of the abolitionist Bodwins, who have repeatedly helped escaped slaves, including the protagonist Sethe and her children, is characterized as that of racists. For when leaving their house on one occasion, Denver, the protagonist Sethe's daughter, notices, "sitting on a shelf by the back door, a blackboy's mouth full of money. [...] Painted across the pedestal he knelt on were the words 'At Yo Service'" (S, 225). Soon afterwards, both the Bodwins are transformed into types. Mr. Bodwin becomes 'the whiteman' (S, 265) and Miss Bodwin a "do-gooder." In an encounter with her former slavemaster, 37 For an enriching analysis of Sula cf. Karen F. Stein, "Toni Morrison's Su/a: A Black Woman's Epic," Black American Literature Forum 18 (1984), 146-150. 38 Bettye J.

Near the end of the story, she symbolically reenacts this crime trying to give it a different ending at the same time. For instead of taking her daughter's life once again, Beloved has returned to her mother as a spirit in the meantime ( B , 261 f.), Sethe now attacks the white man, i.e. Mr. Bodwin. Elsewhere, the Black women, who have witnessed Sethe's attack on him, recall that during this incident Bodwin had eyes only for the naked woman, i.e. Beloved, standing at the door of Sethe's home. Con- sequently, they worry about Denver's future in Bodwin's house as a servant (ß, 265). If in the first example, Bodwin "stands in" for a white slaveholder, with whom he is identified despite his past as an abolitionist, he represents white men who try to sexually exploit Black women in the second. His sister, Miss Bodwin, on the other hand, is placed in the context of white racism only when Denver says of her: "She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me" (S, 266). Examples of additional feminist elements must be omitted here though they seem to abound in this and other novels written by Morrison. In this paper, the author's focus was on assimilationist and feminist ide- ologies, and combinations of them, followed in Morrison criticism. It was shown that the assimilationist critics analyzed had made their evaluations from a white larger society perspective, due to which they failed to recognize Toni Morrison's main narrative strategy, which is to deal with the impact of white racism on black characters from various social strata, and the effects it has on their own psyche and their relations with other members of the Afro-American community. The feminist critics, on the other hand, were found to force versions of the feminist ideology, e.g. one based on the physical notion of gender, on Morrison's novels. Both groups did not quite bear justice to this Black woman writer's fiction. However, as all of those involved in Morrison criticism, including this author, are subject to ideological fallacies, metacriticism should remain high on the agenda of all. Perhaps Toni Morrison will then feel better understood by her critics than she has so far.40 Aribert Schroeder Anglistisches Institut Universität Düsseldorf 40 McKay, "Interview,", op. cit., p.425.</page></plain_text>
