<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes and Commentaries Sociological Imperialism: A Brief Comment on the Comment GRANTED that the columns of scholarly journals like The Sociological Quarterly provide one a forum to express one's opinions even in not too objective a fashion; yet, it hardly follows that one expresses oneself in such a manner that a meaningful communication between him and other scholars is rendered difficult if not impossible. Wilkinson's commentary is a case in point.' Her judgment of the situation is fancied and then misapplied; her terms are obscure, her usage of them anthropomorphic; her premises are unsupported and her contentions inconsistent. Imperialism, according to Wilkinson, "most often has reference to the national policy or advocacy of seeking to extend control or dominion either by forcible annexation of adjoining territory or by acquisition of alien colonies and dependencies . . ." (p. 397). Even if we agree with this definition of the author, it is not easy to accept it "as a framework for interpreting the increasing expansion and spread of sociology" (p. 397) in which sociology is like a "nation," having a "national policy" through which it advocates the annexation ("forcible!") of territory ("adjoining?"). In scholarly discussion personal opinions certainly have a place as long as they are backed by some evidence. However, statements based on unverified prejudgements are neither a substitute for truth nor worthy of serious scholarly consideration. One such example is Wilkinson's third consequence of "sociological imperialism": "inadequate conceptualiza- tion where emphasis is in the wrong direction." Since further exploration is lacking, the reader is at a loss to know why the conceptualization is "inadequate" and the emphasis is "wrong." At another place she writes, ". . . sociology has assumed an imperial- istic disposition. .. ." The anthropomorphism expressed here may be excusable, but the lack of evidence to prove that such a disposition exists hardly is. The inconsistency in her contentions is also obvious. In the first part of her article (p. 397), we read that "all encompassing, synthesizing, generalizing" sociology had exponents like Cooley and Thomas who made possible "the union of psychology and sociology into what was 1 Doris Y.

But later (p. 399) she maintains that a consequence of "sociological imperialism" is the "emergence of a one-sided and deterministic approach (emphasis mine) to the study of human social behavior and human social systems." In conclusion, I may add that it seems more plausible to say that if there is a continued growth in the number of sociological specialists, it is not for the reason that sociology has developed an "imperialistic appe- tite," but because it is trying to live up to its claims under its most widely held definition that sociology is a study of human behavior in all its varied forms. Also, inasmuch as sociologists claim sociology to be a sci- ence, they remain under constant pressure, not of sociological-imperial- ism, but of social determinism (e.g., extensive social demands to provide explanations for varied social phenomena), to continue adding to its list the so far unexplored areas of human behavior. And, as far as it is feasi- ble, they will also be creating special subareas within the broad spectrum of sociological endeavor so that the specialization expected by the social milieu within which they work is also provided.
