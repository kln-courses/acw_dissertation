<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eighteenth Century, vol. 23, no. 2, 1982 THE FATE OF THE FALL IN POPE'S ESSAY ON MAN Douglas Canfield I Alexander Pope claims to have omitted any reference to the Fall of Man from An Essay on Man because it lay outside his sub- ject;1 presumably an appeal to Revelation would be unfair in a strictly rational, philosophical explanation for the problem of evil. Critics from Voltaire to Douglas White and Douglas Atkins have agreed that Pope did omit reference to the Fall for that reason.2 But other critics from the Chevalier Ramsay to Maynard Mack and Anne Barbeau have maintained that he did not, that the story of the Fall is present implicitly and even explicitly. In his excel- lent and seminal introduction to the Twickenham edition of the poem Mack argues not only that Pope has performed the tradi- tional task of proceeding on the grounds of reason alone, but also that he has "telescoped" reason and Revelation and "submerged the second"; indeed, Mack argues that the Essay reflects the fun- damental pattern of the Christian story - "glory, ruin, and restora- tion." And throughout his edition Mack notes what he interprets as specific allusions to the Fall.3 Especially noteworthy are the references to the "Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit" (1.8) and to Milton's great theodicy, Paradise Lost. Pope calls special attention to the relationship between his poem and Milton's by his phrasing of his own purpose, to "vindicate the ways of God to Man" (1.16). Yet other critics, from Warton to A. O. Lovejoy and Michael Macklem, have maintained that Pope's theodicy is not based upon the Fall but contradicts it.4 I should like to pursue this line of An abbreviated version of this paper was delivered at the Fifth International Congress on the Enlightenment, Pisa, Italy, 29 August 1979. 1.

First of all, Pope's ontological explanation for the origin of evil is logically incompatible with the historical explanation. If "Wisdom infinite must form the best" of all "Systems possible"; if nothing is "created perfect," not even man; if "Man's as perfect as he ought"; if, in short, our world is what it is and never could be other, man included, then how could there ever have been an Eden? How could Adam's fall ever have "Brought Death into the World, and all our woe"?5 The other major philosophical optimists of Pope's age were aware that their theories at least problematized the story of the Fall.6 Some responded by rejecting the Fall as a fable, at least implicitly. Repeatedly in The Ethics , Spinoza insists that things are as they are by necessity and cannot be other. For example, proposition 33 states, "Things could not have been brought into being by God in any manner or in any order different from that which has in fact obtained."7 They are brought into being possess- ing the highest perfection possible. In the appendix to this part of his system, Spinoza sets out to bring certain "misconceptions before the bar of reason." Conceiving things anthropomorphi- cally, pre-Rationalists developed certain prejudices, which often hardened into superstition, concerning the nature of things. Spin- oza writes, "Consider, pray you, the result: among the many helps of nature they were bound to find some hindrances, such as storms, earthquakes, diseases, &amp;c.: so they declared that such things happen, because the gods are angry at some wrong done them by men" (pp. 75-76). Similarly, while articulating his optimistic system in The Moral- alists , Shaftesbury creates a dialogue of fictional characters (thus carefully distancing himself from them and their opinions) to explain the appeal of fabular explanations for the problem of evil. Here Philocles explains why the ancients invented - and his mod- World: Relations between Natural and Moral Imw from Donne to Pope (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1958), pp. 61-64.

Greene, The Death of Adam: Evolution and Its Impact on Western Thought (1959; reprint ed., New York: Mentor, 1961). My purpose is to add a small chapter to that history, which has not yet illustrated that the optimism in Pope's Essay and else- where is itself absolutely incompatible with the Fall, that those thinkers knew it, and that they therefore radi- cally reinterpreted Genesis. 7.

Prometheus was the cause If the people asked a question [the ancients] told them a tale, and sent them away satisfied And in reality . . . 'tis not to be imagined how serviceable a tale is to amuse oth- ers besides mere children, and how much easier the generality of men are paid in this papercoin than in sterling reason."8 In his Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil, Soame Jenyns writes, "Others have endeavoured to account for [the origin of evil] by the introduction of a golden age, or paradisiacal state, in which all was innocence and happiness." He quotes from Ovid and concludes, "Amusing dreams! as absurd in philosophy as in poetry delightful." All such "Fables," he generalizes, are "but mean expedients."9 In the preface added later, Jenyns denies that he was referring to the Fall (pp. 5-6). But this denial seems disin- genuous. Jenyns does, after all, employ the phrase "paradisiacal state." And he does more. "How far the literal belief" in "the Mosaic account" of a "paradisiacal state" is "essential to the true faith of a Christian," Jenyns writes, "need not be here decided" (p. 5). Furthermore, as scientists and philosophers had been doing for over a century,10 he reinterprets the Fall as referring only to the origin of moral evil, not physical, a moral evil that is neces- sary in the system (pp. 108-109). This last is an opinion Jenyns shares with the greatest spokes- man for optimism, Lebniz. In his Essais de théodicée and his supporting treatises, Leibniz denies that our world could exist "sans le péché et sans les souffrances."11 When he explicitly addresses the Fall, he treats it as the origin of moral evil, that is, as its entrance into the world, its first instance. But like Jenyns, Leibniz is radically reinterpreting the notion of origin: they both mean temporal precedence; they do not mean primary causality. For Leibniz, the Fall does corrupt mankind and make him more inclined to sin (p. 459 ff .), but man was created "prêt à tomber" (p. 125). Moreover, "la vraie source du mal est l'imperfection ori- 8.

The origin of all evil is ultimately in God's "vérités éternelles": "Cette région est la cause idéale du mal" (p. 121). Finally, the passion with which Leibniz articulates the injustice implicit in the story of the Fall - how a good God could punish so extremely not only offenders but those who never offended at all - indicates how antithetical he considered the two explanations of evil to be (pp. 36-38, 109-111). It seems obvious that for Leibniz the traditional interpretation of Genesis could no longer be literally believed. Meanwhile, Archbishop King had constructed his own optimis- tic theory and reinterpreted Scripture. He clearly argues that imperfection is part of all creation, that death and corruption are natural consequences of matter and motion. King concludes, therefore, that those who explain physical evil as a result of the Fall misinterpret Genesis, that man was not naturally immortal in Eden but was created mortal and granted immortality by special, gratuitous covenant with God - temporarily. All that the Fall did, besides costing us that gift, was exacerbate our natural condition and introduce moral evil into the world. Yet King insists that the Fall is an historical fact, taught us by Revelation, and is not an allegory.12 This brings us to the major thinker most likely to have had a profound influence on Pope, his close friend and the dedicatee of An Essay on Man , Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. In the midst of describing the world as the best that infinite wisdom could create, he argues that all of the interpretations and subse- quent trappings of the story of the Fall are ridiculous and absurd fables invented by power-seeking divines.13 First, the Fall is an ontological absurdity. If there ever were such a perfect world as Eden, it "would have unconnected the universe, and have broke the harmony, and the consent of it's [sic] parts" (5:36). Boling- broke repudiates Samuel Clarke's explication of the Fall and con- cludes, "To think worthily of God, we must think that the natural order of things has been always the same, and that a Being of 12.

Second, the story of the Fall grossly violates our sense of justice: "The Severity with which [God] pun- ished our first parents for a fault, which he foreknew that they would commit when he abandoned their free will to the tempta- tion of committing it, for there would be too much horror in sup- posing them predestinated to commit the fault; this severity, I say, and much more that which has been exercised on the whole race of mankind, who share the punishment, tho they had no share in the crime, cannot be reconciled to our ideas of justice" (4:310). Bolingbroke acknowledges that the Fall is an article of faith and therefore must "be defended as well as it can, since it is made the foundation of the christian system" (4:373); but what it could pos- sibly mean, nobody knows: "The very first principles of christian religion, concerning the fall and redemption of man, are so veiled in mystery of language, that without comment, or with one, and even with that of St. Paul, they give us no clear and distinct ideas, nor any thing more than forms of speech and words to pro- nounce" (4:26-27). Thus Bolingbroke denies any literal referential- ity of the story. The ontological argument has denied its historic- ity. II Does An Essay on Man deny the Fall? Michael Macklem has shown that several of Pope's early critics thought that it did, most notably Crousaz. In his extended commentary, translated by Samuel Johnson, Crousaz addresses the key passage in which Pope postulates that infinite wisdom necessarily created the best of all possible worlds. God, replies Crousaz, created intelligent beings free to abuse their liberty, which man happened to do: "The Knowledge of this Truth discovers the Original of that astonishing Mixture of Perfections and Imperfections, Light and Darkness, Virtue and Vice, which we find in the World."14 Thus Crousaz affirms the traditional doctrine of the origin of Death and all our woe. He warns that we should not confuse what God has done with what man has done (p. 16). And with characteristic irony he says that in order to understand the nature of man "our illustrious Travellers" in modern philosophy would have done 14. J.

In his Essay on Pope , comment- ing on Pope's purpose to "vindicate the ways of God to Man," Warton writes, "Pope seems to have hinted, by this allusion to the Paradise Lost, that he intended his poem for a defence of provi- dence, as well as Milton: but he took a very different method in pursuing that end; and imagined that the goodness and justice of the Deity might be defended, without having recourse to the doc- trine of. . .the depraved state of man."17 It is useful to follow War- ton's commentary on crucial lines from An Essay on Man as he annotates them in his edition of Pope's works: Man's as perfect as he ought. (1.70) Consequently man is not in a lapsed or degenerate state. He is as perfect a being as ever his Creator intended him to be; nor, consequently, did he stand in need of any redemption or atonement.18 The gen 'ral order, since the whole began, Is kept in Nature, and is kept in Man. - (1.171-72) It seems utterly impossible to explain these two remarkable lines in a way at all reconcileable to the doctrine of a lapsed condition of man, which opinion is the chief foundation of the Christian revelation, and the capital argument for the necessity of redemption. (3:33n.) Ere wit oblique had broke that steddy light, Man, like his Maker, saw that all was right. (3.231-32) It was before the Fall of Man, as the sacred historian tells us, that God pronounced - That all was good. But we must bear in mind that our Author never adverts to, or argues from or supposes, any lapsed condition of man. (3:109n.) Thus for Warton, Pope's Essay not only excludes the Fall, it pre- cludes it. 15. Crousaz, p. 19; cf. pp. 25, 54, 55, 83, 84. 16. Lives of the English Poets, ed. George Birkbeck Hill, 3 vols.

While denying the doc- trine of Original Sin as horrible and linking it with other similar myths of origin,19 Voltaire, as we know, thought none too highly of the theory that "Tout est bien." When in Candide Pangloss is explaining away the Lisbon earthquake, the spy for the Inquisition remarks pointedly, "Apparemment que monsieur ne croit pas au péché originel, car si tout est au mieux, il n'y a donc eu ni chute ni punition" (21:448). Voltaire argues on several occasions that optimism attacks the foundations of Christianity, and nowhere is the argument more poignant than in his response to the Lisbon quake (9:463 ff; cf. 21:585). Concerning his poem on the subject and its preface, Voltaire writes to Bertrand that in all ages men have believed in some sort of Fall but that "il faut avouer que Г ouvrage de Pope détruit cette vérité, . . . car si tout est bien , si tout a été comme il devrait être, il n'y a donc point de nature déchue" (38:556). Then Voltaire addresses the poet himself: "Mais mon pauvre Pope, mon pauvre bossu, que j ai connu, que j'ai aimé, qui ta dit que Dieu ne pouvait te former sans bosse? Tu te moques de l'histoire de la pomme! Elle est encore (humainement parlant, et faisant toujours l'abstraction du sacré), elle est plus rai- sonnable que l'optimisme de Leibnitz, elle rend raison pourquoi tu es bossu, malade, et un peu malin" (38:557). If Pope's critics attacked him for Pelagianism, did his admirers defend him or did he deny the charge? To my knowledge, the only contemporary critic to defend him on this score is the Che- valier Ramsay. In 1742, responding to a minor, implied attack on Pope's Pelagianism by Racine Fils,20 Ramsay asserts that Pope is "bien éloigné de l'erreur pélagienne" and that the Essay on Man describes the world after the Fall (Audra, pp. 99-100). Pope him- self eventually wrote a letter to Racine (1 September 1742) affirm- ing "that my Opinions are intirely different from those of Spin- oza; or even of Leibnitz; but on the contrary conformable to those of Möns: Pascal &amp; Möns. Fenelon: the latter of whom I would most readily imitate, in submitting all my Opinions to the Decision of the Church."21 But as Warton justly objects, "How could Pope, in the letter which he wrote to Racine, the son, 1742, venture to say, that his opinions were exactly conformable to 19.

I have been unable to examine the original; but Audra 's treatment of the exchange between Racine and Ram- say, which finally included Pope, focuses precisely on this point and seems thorough. 21.

(Works of Pope, 3:9; cf. 3:139). Moreover, in the letter Pope never explicitly denies the charge of Pelagianism, never actually mentions or implicitly endorses Ram- say's defense, but instead refers Racine to a "Work" he is sending along "written by the Learned Author of the Divine Legation of Moses" - in other words, William Warburton's answer to Crousaz in his Critical and Philosophical Commentary on Mr. Pope's Essay on Man.22 In his Commentary Warburton defends Pope against Crousaz's charge of fatalism, but he very carefully (p. 33) skips those pages in Crousaz's attack which include his explicit charge of Pelagian- ism, or he distorts Crousaz's critique by pretending that it refers to the origin only of " moral evil" (p. 39), which Warburton too reinterprets as simply the temporal origin of sin, its first instance. Finally, concerning the ontological explanation for the origin of evil generally, from Plato's theory of plenitude to Pope, Warbur- ton writes in his Commentary , "As to the Truth of the Notion, that is another Question; And how far it clears up the very diffi- cult Controversy about the Origin of Evil, that is still another. That it is a full Solution of all Difficulties, I cannot think" (pp. 25-26). In his notes to his edition of Pope some twenty years later, he has gained no greater certainty and speculates that the "full solution" may ever elude our grasp.23 This does not sound like a clergyman defending the doctrine of Original Sin - or defending a poet from the charge of Pelagianism. Ill What of the text of the Essay itself? The poem seems to me Pelagian. Certain passages appear calculated directly to challenge the historical argument. Consider the rhetorical force of first arousing the audiences expectations of the traditional with the references to the Garden and to Milton's great purpose and then asserting that if we grant "that Wisdom infinite must form the best" of all possible worlds, "Where all must full or not coherent be," then there must necessarily be "such a rank as Man" exactly where "God has plac'd him" (1.44-50). If man must be where he 22. 1742; reprint ed. New York: Garland, 1974. 23. Reprinted in W. Elwin and W. J. Courthope, eds., The Works of Alexander Pope, 10 vols., 2 (1871; reprint ed.

Reeling from that blow, the traditionalist is hit with the couplet, "Then say not Man's imperfect, Heavn in fault; / Say rather, Man s as perfect as he ought" (1.69-70). In other words, man's imperfection is really perfection, within his limits ("Call Imperfection what thou fan- cy st such" [1.115]). But maybe, says the unconvinced traditional- ist, Pope means, as Ramsay interprets him, after the Fall. Then why would he insist on mocking the notion that man was ever "Alone made perfect here" (1.120)? The crucial passage is again phrased in ironic discourse with Pope's fictional adversary, who grants the necessity of physical evil (so much for that aspect of the consequences of the Fall) and agrees that God acts "not by partial, but by gen ral laws; "Th' exceptions few; some change since all began, "And what created perfect?" (1.146-48)24 Pope interrupts to ask him - and us - the crucial question, "Why then Man?" Why then should God have made any special excep- tion to the general rule and created man any better than he is? Pope insists again and again that the entire world, including man, could never have existed in any other than its present state of imperfection. He mocks implicitly the notion of a Paradise: we have as much right to expect "eternal springs" and "cloudless skies" as we do "Men for ever template, calm, and wise" (1.153- 54). It is silly to think that man could ever have heard "the music of the spheres" (1.202). Furthermore, Pope removes the possibility of reinterpreting the Fall as the origin of moral evil: If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav n's design, Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline? Account for moral as for nat'ral things. (1.155-56, 162) Just as "all subsists by elemental strife" - a first principle of nature, without which nothing could exist - so also "Passions," the 24. Can the phrase "some change since all began" refer, as Mack in his note to the passage and others fol- lowing him suggest, to the Fall? The import of the foregoing evidence seems to me to forbid it. Moreover, if Pope wanted to introduce the Fall - the traditional explanation for the origin of all physical and moral evil, an event with cataclysmic consequences - why identify it with minor and very few "exceptions" to general laws of nature? Such a reading violates the context and distorts the next half-line, "'And what created perfect?"' If the supposed "change" is the Fall, then something must have been created perfect and Pope's logic is contra- dictory. If my argument here is correct, a fortiori it is correct in the later passage interpreted by Mack to be a reference to the Fall: "Or Change admits, or Nature lets it fall,/ Short and but rare, 'til Man improv'd it all" (4. 115-16). Man may improve imperfection, make it worse, but how could he do so if it did not previously exist? Cf. Warton's note to this passage: "The reasons assigned for the Origin of Evil, in these two lines, are surely not solid and satisfactory, and the doctrine is expressed in obscure and equivocal terms" ( Works of Alexander Pope, 3:135). Warburton, who especially in the light of Ramsay's letter would have had good reason for doing so, interprets neither passage as referring to the Fall.</page><page sequence="10">CANFIELD - POPE'S ESSAY ON MAN 143 "elements of Life," are "like Elements" ontologically "born to fight" (1.169-70, 2.111). There could never have been a time when Man's elements were not at strife, a strife which inevitably, by the nature of things, produces death: "Man, perhaps, the moment of his breath,/ Receives the lurking principle of death" (2.133-34). Thus, the greatest of physical evils is endemic to man. And with regard to moral evil, there could never have been a time when "The Mind's disease, its ruling Passion" was not "cast and mingled with his very frame" (2.137-38): Virtuous and vicious ev ry Man must be, Few in th extreme, but all in the degree. (2.231-32) If Man ever would have or could have been more perfect or if he ever aspire to a higher state, he would, as Bolingbroke suggests, destroy the "great scale" of Being itself (1.244). Thus it is that Pope can assert, The gen'ral order, since the whole began, Is kept in Nature, and is kept in Man. (1.171-72) IV So perhaps Pope omitted the Fall of man from consideration in his Essay not so much because it lay outside his subject but because it contradicted his ontological theodicy. And yet, of course, he did not omit reference to it. An Essay on Man alludes often to the traditional story, as in the references to "the Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit" and Paradise Lost already cited, or in these passages: In Pride, in reas'ning Pride, our error lies; All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies. Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes, Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods. Aspiring to be Gods, if Angels fell, Aspiring to be Angels, Men rebel. (1.123-128) Know then this truth (enough for Man to know) "Virtue alone is Happiness below." The only point where human bliss stands still, And tastes the good without the fall to ill. (4.309-312) But Pope does not simply allude to the story of the Fall. He builds into his poem a ubiquitous pattern of imagery of falling and rising, often employing the word "fall" in the key position of rhyme-word: Who sees with equal eye, as God of all, A hero perish, or a sparrow fall. (1.87-88)</page><page sequence="11">144 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY The least confusion but in one, not all That system only, but the whole must fall. (1.249-250) Created half to rise, and half to fall; Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all. (2.15-16) Fools! who from hence into the notion fall, That Vice or Virtue there is none at all. (2.211-212) And just as short of Reason he must fall, Who thinks all made for one, not one for all. (3.47-48) Or indolent, to each extreme they fall, To trust in ev'ry thing, or doubt of all. (4.25-26) Or Change admits, or Nature lets it fall, Short and but rare, 'till Man improv'd it all. (4.115-116) Or some old temple, nodding to its fall, For Chartres' head reserve the hanging wall? (4.129-130) Think, and if still the things thy envy call, Say, would'st thou be the Man to whom they fall? (4.275-276) Moreover, as Mack has shown, Pope fashions each epistle from a pattern of rising in pride, falling, and rising again. I would argue that the entire poem follows such a pattern: Man's rising through pride in his reason in the first epistle, dropping into him- self through mortifying self-knowledge in the second, and gradu- ally rising from self-love to social and divine. Why this super- abundance of imagery of falling? Because, I think, far from evading the clash between the ontological and the historical arguments, Pope insists on yoking them together - in order to subordinate the historical, to imply that it is no longer available for literal belief ( pace Archbishop King), in short, to reinterpret it as merely a metaphor. First, Pope reinterprets the Fall as a metaphor for something which occurs not once but perennially, synchronically, in man's continual fall through "reas'ning pride," through his rebellion against the nature of things, through the rebellion of his passions, through political rebellion, through religious rebellion. Man rises in pursuit of the wrong things - such as Fortune, fame, riches - only to fall. Thus perhaps the seeming poverty in Pope's recurrent rhyme "fall-air' may, as W. K. Wimsatt taught us to suppose,25 have semantic significance. Pope has reinterpreted the Fall as not just that of Adam and Eve but the Fall of All, of Everyman, at every moment in time and not just the first. A glance back now at all these references to falling reveals them to be metaphoric, even 25.

New York: Noonday, n.d.), pp. 152-66.</page><page sequence="12">CANFIELD- POPE'S ESSAY ON MAN 145 those apparently alluding to the historical Fall. The tempting "Garden" is not the Eden of the past but part of the setting of the present where St. John ( not the author of a Gospel) and Pope "expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man" (1.5). Men's rebellious aspiration to "be Angels" is a perennial activity ("Pride still is aim- ing at the blest abodes"), not an original one; and the sin of Man is no longer against God's edict in Eden but against ontological design: And who but wishes to invert the laws Of ORDER, sins against th'Eternal Cause. (1.129-30) Tasting "the good without the fall to ill" is obviously not a literal reference to Eden; it refers to thè virtuous resistance against a continuing temptation. Thus Pope's appeal to St. John, Teach me, like thee, in various nature wise, To fall with dignity, with temper rise, (4.277-278) is a fitting conclusion to this motif in the poem. We are all con- stantly falling, failing - poets too - and we must turn each fall into something fortunate as we attempt to rise again. Second, Pope reinterprets the Fall as a metaphor for something that occurs diachronically. For example, man's fall from the State of Nature is an original fall. But it is not the same as the Judeo- Christian Fall, as Warburton tacitly acknowledges.26 Pope's State of Innocence may be similar to that in Genesis; but here are no Adam and Eve, no tree, no serpent. The eating of the apple may be said to be replaced by the eating of meat, which Pope mem- orably satirizes here. Even so, is such carnivorism portrayed as the origin of death and woe? Apparently not. There is a falling off here, but no dramatic fall. As in all allegories and myths, what Pope omits is very instructive. Though he does not say so explic- itly, man in this State of Nature must by Pope's system be natu- rally mortal; he must already naturally possess the "Mind's dis- ease," its already tainted "ruling Passion." Is Pope offering this myth as the origin of moral evil, that is, its first instance? If so, why not portray the first instance as an event, a significant action of some kind? The absence of such a portrayal suggests that 26. Warburton refers to the description of the State of Nature in the third epistle as "the Description of Man in Paradise" ( Commentary , p. 43). When he comes to discuss it in detail, he notes Crousaz's comment: what Pope "tells us is much less credible, consider 'd merely in itself, than the Account which Moses hath given us (Crousaz, p. 180). Warburton asserts, "The Account here given of the State of Innocence is indeed no other than that of Moses himself" (p. 115). But when Warburton expanded on this section in the Commentary and Notes to his later edition of Pope's works, he revealed that he himself was reinterpreting Genesis. He again calls Pope's Golden Age "the state of innocence, as represented in Scripture," but his subsequent narrative relates no dramatic Fall but rather a smooth transition, even an ascent from natural to civil society (Elwin and Courthope, 2:481-82).</page><page sequence="13">146 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY Pope's account is decidedly a fiction - constructed, it would seem, for the purpose of refuting Hobbes. Like all utopias and myths of origin, it exists to reflect our place here and now and is itself ou- topos - no place. Moreover, Pope presents the history of society as cyclic, a series of falls; and the description of the ideal state at the end of the epistle is the rhetoric of desire, a holding out of the possibility of a better - but not perfect - concordia discors. Another diachronic use of the pattern of falling occurs when Pope suggests that if man's pride and rebellion press too far, the Fall is liable to be apocalyptic: On superior pow'rs Were we to press, inferior might on ours: Or in the full creation leave a void, Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy 'd: From Nature's chain whatever link you strike, Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike. And if each system in gradation roll, Alike essential to th'amazing whole; The least confusion but in one, not all That system only, but the whole must fall. (1.241-250) Yet even this Fall will not bear a literal interpretation. The status of the image is rhetorical: it reinforces Pope's claim that the pres- ent ontology cannot be other without ceasing to exist; and it rein- forces Pope's warning to our pride. Thus all these images of fal- ling are merely tropes. V In sum, Pope's claim to have omitted any reference to the Fall from An Essay on Man seems to me a protective smokescreen. The Fall does not lie outside his subject, for that subject is the origin of evil, and the ontological explanation logically contradicts the historical. The major optimists at least suspected as much; and most of Pope's early commentators, as well as some moderns, have read his poem as such a contradiction. The poem seems to me implicitly Pelagian. But rather than omit reference to the Fall to avoid that contradiction or at least leave it implicit, Pope does indeed, as Mack argues, submerge the "revealed" historical expla- nation of evil into the metaphoric texture of the poem, into perva- sive imagery of falling. By doing so, I am convinced, he signifies that the Fall refers to no literal, historical event but is only a met- aphor we use to explain the presence of evil and the absence of perfection. But by doing so, does Pope not also, willy-nilly, call attention to the metaphorical character of his own ontological system? What</page><page sequence="14">CANFIELD- POPE'S ESSAY ON MAN 147 can be more metaphorical than the Great Chain of Being, which dominates Epistle 1? The "ruling Passion," which dominates Epis- tle 2? The "chain of Love" in the opening of Epistle 3, which is displaced immediately by Newton's metaphor of attraction? "The World's great harmony" at the close of that epistle? Happiness as a "Plant of celestial seed" in the opening of Epistle 4? Can these controlling metaphors themselves bear a literal interpretation? Do they not underline the tropological nature of the entire poem, from its ironies to its paradoxes, rhetorical questions, and espe- cially its begging the question by constantly assuming the system to be proved (whatever is must be right)? The tropological nature of Pope's own system seems to me to reinforce another frequently discussed theme in the poem, the limits of human reason.27 We set out to explore what is a "mighty maze," whose "plan" is merely assumed a priori (1.6). We can "reason, but from what we know" (1.18), which is "too much knowledge for the Sceptic side" (2.5); and yet we reason "but to err" (2.10): Man is "Sole judge of Truth, in endless Error hurl'd" (2.17). Though we apparently have a "God within the mind" to divide light from darkness in moral matters (2.204, another meta- phorical use of Genesis, by the way); though we can apparently infer the existence of God a posteriori (3.225-226); and though common sense can apparently teach us wherein happiness lies (4.29, 335 et passim ); nevertheless, the height of wisdom is "but to know how little can be known" (4.261). Like his mentor Bolingbroke, then, whose writings are filled with attacks on reason, on rational philosophy and theology, Pope constantly presents us with the paradox of knowing what we can- not know. Despite his concluding statement that Bolingbroke was responsible for turning Pope "From sounds to things" (4.392), the dense metaphoricity of his poem implies that we never arrive at "things" in any absolute sense, that what we do know is just a sign, a likeness, an analogy. From the outset Pope problematizes the literal referentiality of his system in a remarkable anticipation of Kant: he begins the "Argument of the First Epistle" of An Essay on Man asserting, "We can judge only with regard to our own system , being ignorant of the relations of systems and things" 27. Nearly every recent critic discusses this theme. See esp. French, "Pope, Milton, and the Essay on Man'; F. E. L. Priestly, "Pope and the Great Chain of Being," in Essays in English Literature from the Renaissance to the Victorian Age Presented to A. S. P. Woodhouse, ed. Millar Maclure and R. W. Watt (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1964), pp. 213-28; Priestly, "'Order, Union, Full Consent of Things!'," University of Toronto Quarterly 42 (1972): 1-13; and Patricia Meyer Spacks, An Argument of Images: The Poetry of Alexander Pope (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971), ch. 3.</page><page sequence="15">148 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY (EM, p. 9, italics reversed). And in an equally remarkable letter to Caryll in 1714 Pope adumbrates this position: Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human sciences Half the things that employ our heads deserve not the name of thoughts, they are only stronger dreams or impressions upon the imagination; our schemes of government, our systems of philosophy, our golden words of poetry, are all but so many shadow images and airy prospects, which arise to us but so much the livelier and more frequent as we are more overcast with the darkness, wrapt in the night, and disturbed with the fumes of human van- ity. ( Correspondence , 1:236) Thus all our systems, our "golden worlds" (as Pope rewrote the phrase later), our Golden Ages, all our "golden words" at best are daydreams, shadows of an absent substance, set off in a false lumi- nescence against the darkness of our ignorance and our empti- ness. In a Swiftian image, Pope suggests that all our words are but "fumes" of vanity, which rise as we exalt our self-importance, a movement preparatory to another of those falls into self- awareness, which here means awareness of the limitations of lan- guage. The ultimate fall in An Essay on Man , then, may perhaps be seen as the fall into metaphor itself, into a figurative language which can never finally or precisely name the Ding an sich.28 Not that the poem is relativistic in any absolute sense, Pyrrhonic. But it is not strictly rationalistic either. Nor is it as conservative and orthodox as critics from Ramsay to Mack, Atkins, and Barbeau would make it. Pope has alluded to Paradise Lost in order, I think, to draw attention to the unbridgeable gap between the theodicy of Milton's poem and that of his own. But at the same time, in the supposedly ultimate Rationalist poem of its era, by metaphorizing the Fall and implicitly underlining the metaphori- city of his own and indeed of all philosophic as well as poetic utterance, Pope leaves us in need of the same act of faith as Mil- ton or Job or Moses. The answer to the ineluctable, cankerous problems of physical and moral evil, of all our suffering and loss, of death and all our woe, as Pope says in one of his most eloquent passages, and one of the last he added to the poem (in 1743), Who knows but he, whose hand the lighťning forms, Who heaves old Ocean, and who wings the storms. (1.157-158) 28. Cf. the old opinion, reaching back through the Renaissance at least to Saint Augustine, that language is imperfect because of the Fall (or Babel). While his opinion of language would appear to be similar, if I am right, for Pope language could not be historically fallen; it would be ontologically "fallen" and could never have been more perfect. Thus its metaphoricity would be radical in its root sense.</page><page sequence="16">CANFIELD - POPE'S ESSAY ON MAN 149 We are finally left with this enigmatic, anthropomorphic, meta- phoric figure of myth, in whose absent analogue we must choose to believe or not believe. I think Pope chose to believe it and that his poem everywhere urges an act of faith that, however fallen man and his language, the poet's metaphors can nevertheless shadow forth truth about ineffable "things,"29 such as Order and Meaning, Purpose and Jus- tice, and especially an Afterlife, where man's desire for perfection will finally be fulfilled. For though man could never have been perfectly "blest" in the past but is as blest as ever, Pope insists that "Nature plants" in man "Faith in bliss unknown" (4.345-46). Pope hints at this possibility of future bliss early when he writes, If to be perfect in a certain sphere, What matter, soon or late, or here or there? The blest today is as completely so, As who began a thousand years ago. (1.73-76) The "blest" of these lines is itself merely an intertextual trope. It refers to countless literary, mythic, anthropomorphic descriptions of some postmortem state of bliss from the Classical Islands of the Blest to the Christian Heaven to the Amerind's Happy Hunt- ing Ground, which Pope portrays as in some ways more appeal- ing than the Christian fictions of Heaven and Hell (1.99 ff.). Without faith, such a trope is merely a sign of our desire, an eter- nally floating signifier. But with faith, one can interpret the lines as referring, however obliquely, to those who have died and found their metaphoric "home" (1.97), a state of perfection, happ- iness, the bliss wanting here.30 With faith, the reality of that state can be seen to be as perpetual as the desire for it: Hope springs eternal in the human breast: Man never Is, but always To be blest. (1.95-96) Pope later asserts, albeit through the trope of personification, "Hope travels thro', nor quits us when we die" (2.274), and his question toward the end, "Will Heav'n reward us there /With the same trash mad mortals wish for here?" (4.173-74), presumes the existence of a "there," however nondescript. Part of the answer to the problem of evil, then, is that if we are naturally fallen here in this life, we need not eternally remain so. Pope has omitted any reference to a Savior (though he thought of appending an address 29. For one of the best recent attempts to argue the truth of metaphor, see Paul Ricoeur, The Rule of Met- aphor: Multi-disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in iMiiguage, trans. Robert Czerny et al. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1977), esp. study 8. For a brief glimpse of Ricoeur's position, see "The Metaphorical Process as Cognition, Imagination, and Feeling," Critical Inquiry 5 (1978): 143-59. 30. Cf. Kallich, ch. 2, with whom I am in obvious disagreement.</page><page sequence="17">150 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY to Him); but he obviously interprets the ubiquity of "Hope," which God gives man for his "blessing" here and now (1.93-94), as an unrevealed sign of eventual - if only eschatological - re- demption. To conclude: like Leibniz, King, and Warburton, and unlike Spinoza, Shaftesbury, Jenyns, and Bolinbroke, Pope seems to me to want to reinterpret the Story of the Fall (instead of merely neg- lecting or discarding it) in order to save it for religious signifi- cance. For him, in contrast to Bolingbroke, that Story would be "more than forms of speech and worlds to pronouce" - not liter- ally but metaphorically true, a sign of a lack that is natural but not necessarily eternal. It is in this sense that his opinions are "conformable" to those of Pascal. That is, at the same time that Pope must use language and reason to argue his position systemat- ically, he appears aware of the limits of both. Nevertheless, he also appears to urge a hope that his metaphors shadow forth a God Who cannot be scanned but Who may be inferred and in Whose ultimate resolution to the problem of evil we may trust. The part cannot contain the whole (1.32), yet we must "Hope humbly" (1.91) that our inferences are not altogether vain. The fate of the Fall in An Essay on Man is finally to be displaced from fact to fiction and to become a sign of the fictiveness of all attempts to arrive at absolute fact - except through faith itself.</page></plain_text>
