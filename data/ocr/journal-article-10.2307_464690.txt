Impression of cold. toxto/oortoxto TIlI IUOLLS ( 1 IBUNIAIU Roland Barthes (translated by David Savran) The dolls of Bunraku are between one and two meters in height. They are little men or little women, with mobile limbs, hands and mouths. Each doll is moved by three visible men who surround it, support it and follow it around. The master controls the top of the doll and its right arm; his face is uncovered, sleek, bright, impassive, cold like "a white onion that has just been washed."' His assis- tants are in black, a piece of cloth hiding their faces. One, gloved, with his thumb uncovered, holds a large stringed chisel with which he moves the doll's left arm and hand. The other, crawling, supports the body and makes it walk. These men traverse the length of a shallow pit which leaves their bodies visible. The scenery is behind them, as in the theatre. On the side, a platform supports the musicians and the narrators whose role it is to express the text (the way juice is pressed from a fruit). This text is half spoken, half sung; punctuated by great plectrum strokes of the shamisen players, it is measured and at the same time ejaculated with violence and artistry. Sweating and immobile, these voice-conveyors (porte-voix) are seated behind small lecterns on which is placed the grand text which they vocalize, whose vertical characters one catches sight of from afar as they turn a page of their book. A triangle of stiff cloth, attached to their shoulders like a kite, frames their faces, which are subject to all the torments of the voice. Antithesis is a privileged device in our culture, doubtless because it corre- sponds so well to our vision of good and bad, and to that inveterate emblematiza- tion which makes us convert every word into one defined by contrast with its antonym (creativity versus intelligence, spontaneity versus reflection, truth versus appearance, etc.). Bunraku mocks these opposites, this antinomy which rules all our ethic of discourse. In taking up a fundamental antilogy, that of animate/inanimate (present, moreover, in the very structure of the Japanese language) Bunraku ob- scures it, dissolves it, without promoting either of its terms. Among us, the mario- nette (Pulcinella, for example) is given the task of extending to the actor the mirror of his opposite; it animates the inanimate, but only to display more clearly its de- gradation, the indignity of its inertia. A caricature of "life," it defines, for that very reason, the moral limits of life, and claims to confine beauty, truth and emotion to the living body of the actor, who, however, makes of this body a falsehood. Bunraku does not mimic the actor, it frees us of him. How? Precisely through a certain conception of the human body, which inanimate matter expresses with infinitely more rigor and vibration than the animate body (gifted with a "soul"). The occidental (naturalistic) actor is never beautiful. His body is of a physiological and not a plastic essence: it is a collection of organs, a musculature of passions, whose every activity (voice, bearing, gesture) is submitted to a sort of gymnastic exercise. And although based upon a division of the essential passions, the body of the actor, through a particularly bourgeois reversal, borrows from physiology the alibi of an organic unity, that of "life:" it is the actor who has here become the marionette, despite the coherence of his playing (jeu), whose model is not the caress, but only the visceral "truth." Thus, under his "living" and "natural" exterior, the occidental actor preserves the division of his body and consequently, the nourishment of our phantasms: here a voice, there a look, there again a figure, each eroticized as so many pieces of a body, as so many fetishes. The occidental marionette (this is clearly visible in Pul- cinella) is also a phantasmic by-product: as a reduction, a grating reflection whose appurtenance to the human order is ceaselessly recalled by a caricatured simula- tion. It lives not as a whole body does in total vibration, but as a rigid part of the reprinted with the permission of Editions Skira. 44</page><page sequence="2">actor from whom it emanates, as an automaton which is still a fragment of move- ment, a jolt, shock, essence of discontinuity, a decomposed projection of bodily gestures, and finally, as a doll, reminiscence of a piece of rag, of a genital dressing, it is indeed the phallic "little thing" ("das Kleine"), fallen from the body to become a fetish. It could well be that the Japanese marionette retains something of this phan- tasmic origin, but the art of Bunraku imparts to it a different meaning. Bunraku does not aim to "animate" an inanimate object in such a way as to make a piece of the body live, a shred of man, all the while retaining its vocation as a "part." It isn't the simulation of a body which is sought, but rather, if we may say so, its palpable abstraction. All that we attribute to the total body and which is denied to our actors under the cover of an organic and "living" unity, the little man of Bunraku recovers and speaks without any falsehood: fragility, discretion, sumptuousness, extraordinary nuance, abandonment of all triviality, melodic phrasing of gestures, in short, the very qualities which the dreams of ancient theology accorded the glorious body, namely impassiveness, clarity, agility, subtlety. That is what Bunraku fulfills, that is how it converts the body from a fetish into an object of affection, that is how it denies the antinomy of animate/inanimate and dismisses the concept which lurks behind any animation of matter, and which is quite simply the "soul." Another opposition destroyed: that of inside/outside. Take the occidental. theatre of the last centuries: its function has been essentially to make manifest that which is reputedly secret (the "sentiments," the "situations," the "conflicts") while hiding the very artifice of the representation (machinery, scene painting, make-up, lighting). The Italianate stage is the space of this falsehood: everything happens there in an interior surreptitiously opened, surprised, espied, savoured by a hidden spectator. This space is theological, it is that of Original Sin: on the one side, in a light which it pretends to ignore, the actor (that is, gesture and speech); on the other, in the shadows, the public (that is, consciousness). Bunraku does not directly subvert the relationship between the house and the stage (no more than Brecht did) even though the Japanese theatres are infinitely less confining, less stifling, less oppressive than ours. That which it alters, most profoundly, is the motor link which connects the character to the actor and which we always conceive as the path of expression of an interiority. It must be remembered that the agents of the spectacle in Bunraku are visible and impassive at the same time. The men in black busy themselves around the doll, but it is without any affectation of adroitness or discretion, and, if we may say so, without the demagogy of publicity; silent, rapid, elegant, their actions are eminently transitive, operative, colored by this mingling of force and subtlety which distinguishes the Japanese repertoire of gesture (ges- tuaire) and which is the aesthetic envelope for efficiency. As we have noticed, the master's head is uncovered; sleek, naked, without make-up, this bestows upon him a civil (non-theatrical) mark, his face is offered to the reading of the spectators. But that which is so carefully, so precisely given to be read, is that there is nothing there to read. Here we may recognize the liberation from meaning which truly illuminates so many oriental works, and which we can scarcely comprehend, since, among us, to attack meaning is to conceal it or reverse it, but never to absent it. With Bunraku, the sources of the theatre are etposed in their emptiness. What is expelled from the stage is the hysteria, that is, the theatre itself, and what is put in its place is the action necessary for the production of the spectacle: work is substituted for interiority. It is, then, vain to ask, as do many Europeans (like Claudel), whether the spec- tator can or cannot forget the presence of the manipulators. Bunraku practices neither concealment nor the emphatic presentation of its means. Thus, it frees the actor's vitality from all traces of the sacred, and abolishes the metaphysical link which the Occident cannot keep from establishing between soul and body, cause and effect, motor and machine, agent and actor, Destiny and man, God and his creation.2 If the manipulator is not hidden, why do you, how can you make him a God? In Bunraku the puppet is not held by any wire. More than wire, thus more than metaphor, more than Destiny; the marionette no longer apes the creature, man is no longer a marionette in the hands of the divinity, the inside no longer commands the outside. Finally, an enterprise even more radical, Bunraku attacks the writing (6criture) of the spectacle. For us this writing implies an illusion of totality. "There is nothing more difficult for us to accept," says Brecht, "than breaking with the habit of con- sidering an artistic production as a whole."3 It is undoubtedly for that reason that recurrently, from the Greek choreia to bourgeois opera, we conceive of the lyric art as the simultaneity of many expressions (played, sung, mimed) whose origin is unique, indivisible. This origin is the body, and the totality demanded has for its model an organic unity: the occidental spectacle is anthropomorphic.4 In it, ges- ture and speech (without speaking of song) form but one fabric, clustered and lubri- lo, 06, X-% al ml Ilk, Yw S"Bunraku . .. is, in simplest terms, metaphysical theatre....

The unity of movement and voice produces the one who plays; or in other words, it is within this unity that is constituted the person of the character, that is the actor. In Bunraku, on the other hand, no person is on the stage, or to be more exact, no one person is installed there. The sensual (personal) illusion disappears, not because the actors are made of wood, of some material (we have it that Bun- raku, on the contrary, designates a certain affection for the human body), but be- cause its codes of expression are detached one from the other, unglued by the organic cement which maintains the occidental theatre. Bunraku practices in effect three separate modes of writing, which allow us to read simultaneously three areas of the spectacle: the marionette, the manipulator, the vocalizer: the effected gesture, he who effects the gesture, and the vocal gesture. Voice: the real issue at stake in modernity, the particular substance of language, which we try to make triumph everywhere. Modern society believes it is bringing about (it has often been said) a civilization of the image. But, in fact, that which it everywhere installs, and particularly in its leisure activities, overwhelmingly spoken, is a civilization of the word. Bunraku, on the other hand, has a limited idea of the voice; it does not supress it, but assigns to it a well defined function which is essentially trivial. In the voice of the reciter come together exaggerated declaration, tremolo, overly shrill feminine tone, broken intonations, tears, par- oxysms of anger, of pity, of supplication, of astonishment, indecent pathos, in short, all the cuisine of emotion, overtly elaborated on the level of this internal, visceral body for which the larynx is the mediating muscle. Still, this overflowing is expressed only through the very code of overflowing: the voice moves through some discontinuous signs of tempest; and the vocal substance, pushed out of an immobile body, triangulated by the costume, connected to a book which, from its stand, guides it, drily studded by the slightly out of phase (and by the same token, impertinent) strokes of the shamisen player, this vocal substance remains written, discontinuous, coded, submitted to an irony (if one divests the word of all caustic meaning). Also, that which the voice exteriorizes, in the last analysis, is not that which it carries (the "sentiments"), it is itself, its own prostitution. While feigning to bring forth the contents (anecdotes, passions) the signifier does nothing but craft- ily turn itself inside out like a glove. *041 ?-'a: Qt del I J(J* pow Ik, ?-o M al%- log,, Without being eliminated (which would be a means of censuring it, that is, of designating its importance), the voice is put to the side (scenically, the reciters oc- cupy a lateral platform). Bunraku gives it a counterweight, or better, a counter- march: that of gesture. The gesture is double: emotive gesture on the level of the marionette (the figures weep at the suicide of the doll-lover), transitive action on the level of the manipulators. In our theatrical art, the actor feigns action, but his actions are never anything but gestures: on the stage, merely theatrical, and yet an ashamed theatricality. Bunraku itself (that is its definition) separates the action from the gesture: it shows gesture, it lets the action be seen, it exposes the art and the work at the same time, reserving to each its own writing. The voice (and 46</page><page sequence="4">there is no risk of letting it reach the extreme limits of its range), the voice is doubled by a vast volume of silence, on which other traits, other writings are in- scribed with all the more finesse. And here an extraordinary effect is produced: ri- moved from the voice, and almost without the use of mime, these silent writings, the one transitive, the other gestural, produce an exultation as special, perhaps, as the intellectual hyperesthesia attributed to certain drugs. The word is not purified (Bunraku is not concerned with asceticism), but, if we may say so, amassed on the 4Pf side of play, the muddying substances of occidental theatre dissolved; it becomes reading, the stereotypes disappear without the spectacle running over into original- ity or "discovery." Surely, all this is in conformity with the distancing effect recom- mended by Brecht, who was the first, it must be remembered, to understand and speak of the critical importance of the oriental theatre. This distance, reputedly impossible among us, useless or derisive, and hastily abandoned, although Brecht had located it precisely at the center of revolutionary dramaturgy (and this doubt- lessly explains that), Bunraku makes comprehensible the way in which this distance can function: by the discontinuity of codes, by this caesura imposed upon the dif- ferent features of the performance, so that the copy elaborated on the stage is not at all destroyed, but is as if broken, scored, freed from the metonymic contagion of voice and gesture, of the spirit and the body, which cements together our actor. Total spectacle, but disunited, Bunraku of course excludes improvisation: it doubtlessly recognizes that a return to spontaneity is a return to the stereotypes of which our "profundity" is constituted. As Brecht recognized in the oriental actor, whose lesson he hoped to receive and propagate, here reigns the quotation,5 the pinch of writing, the fragment of code, since none of the organizers of the per- formance (jeu) may claim for himself what he hasn't written on his own. As in the modern text, the interweaving of codes, of references, of separate declarations, of anthological gestures, multiplies the written line, not by virtue of some metaphysical call but by the play of a combinatoire which opens into the whole theatre space: that which is begun by the one is continued by the other, ceaselessly. 5 "A priori, his play is reduced to quoting the character-but with such art! He needs only a minimum of illu- sion. What he shows provides interest even for one who has kept his wits about him."
