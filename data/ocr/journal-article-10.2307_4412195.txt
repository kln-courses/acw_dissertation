There was a strange silence about his manner of dying. The Hindu in its inimitable style observed 'Noted Tech- nologist missing'. It almost seemed an act of absentmindedness. Even today friends stop me and ask "Tell me, is he alive, living quietly in some ashram?" I sometimes dream that he is talking to the fishes, discussing the possibilities of algae or speculating about the dreams of photosynthesis. One misses the laughter of the man, the exuberance, and the strange sadness. C V Seshadri was more than a scientist. He used to growl "I am not a sociologist of science. I am a scientist and I want my science to do the talking." And talk it did in many voices. I can still remember the day he drove in late, stood in front of the car glaring at the tyre as if it was a new exotic species. He looked like a huge little boy lost and said "Gender was the first diversity and we muffed it." I asked him wickedly "Did you quarrel with your wife today?" and he said, "Yes", as if 'yes' was an affirmation of life in all its complications. For him everything was autobiographi- cal and everything was cosmological. He loved life in its grand patterns and loved life in its little particulars. I remember V Balaji once told me, "for Doc, science was not about policy and populations. Science was about particular persons. He wanted to know what troubled Rajathi and he turned her complaints into scientific problems." For Seshadri, an autobiogra- phy could not be an act of book keeping and he hated the chartered accountants of life. He made mistakes and he hurt people. Some of his decisions were disastrous particularly the choice of his successor. Yet he could reflect on his mistakes. He was a hundred unfinished hypotheses. He was fascinated by death, was himself quite a hypochondriac but saw hypochondria as a collection of redeemable hypotheses. He never wanted the last word. In that sense, his was a minoritarian politics. He did not seek to establish an alternative authority in scientific matters, just the possibility of difference. He could not comprehend the lack of forgiveness in radicalism. I remember, that when Claude Alvares and Vandana Shiva were savaging M S Swaminathan, he was strangely gentle. "One can't blame Swaminathan. It is the question of markers, of what we want. If you want petrol and hybrids and synthetic fertilisers you can't run away from the Green Revolution." He asked me once "How can JNU pro- fessors start a revolution? They don't even clean their own desk." All these little things were mysteries for him, curiosities he chewed over, again and again, seeking connections. And he loved connections and the surprises they created. The flowering of the bamboo fascinated him. The bamboo flowers simultaneously for hundreds of miles. He then added that nurses in a hostel would all have their periods simultaneously. The synchronicity of events fascinated him and he felt there was more to it than Jung realised. He felt Indians were cosmologists except when it came to modern western science and he missed this cosmic day dreaming and this thinking with the hands. He wanted sci- ence to be a life giving myth and he read and reread Descartes, Poincare and Feynman to see the possibilities of one. He saw the Cartesian meditations as an ethical exercise. His was an anthropologi- cal, even a religious sense of science as a mode of thought and a code of conduct. A Confucian science. An ethics of possi- bility. Not method but ritual and beyond method, life styles. He loved Paul Feyerabend but saw his epistemological anarchism as a truncated critique, a Dadaism that never really challenged method because it failed as a cosmology. He loved words, their magic, and their etymology. He was obsessed with dictio- naries as a form of life and always wanted to write one. An Ambrose Beirce on sci- ence, a philosophical dictionary, a "don't use me" dictionary. He had even scribbled the beginnings of one. For him everything was a sign to be read. Landscapes, build- ings and bodies. Even chemistry was an almost semiotic discipline, an alchemy where matter, meaning, sign, symbol and symptom could combine and yet be read separately. In that sense, history of science was a part of science and not separate from it as De Solla Price and other historians had argued. I begin by outlining the philosophical smell of the man because it is the man as philosopher and political scientist that I wish to talk about. V Balaji in the first Seshadri lecture talked about the innova- tor. Sunil Sahasrabuddhe in the second talked about his moral science and the importance of an 'ambient' science. I want to move away from this. Seshadri's work on thermodynamics is well known. His work on algae is happily visible, even consumable. I do not want to talk about his laboratory experiments, his work on boats, windmills, algae or biogas. It is premature to evaluate his work on time. I want to consider a few fragments of conversation, a few asides, a few unpub- lished notes. I want to talk of Seshadri's work as a possibility of politics, which I consider one of the hidden thought experi- ments of his work. My essay 'The Self, the Laboratory and the World' is an at- tempt to examine how Seshadri' s ideas can be applied to governance, justice, and citizenship. There is an irony here. Seshadri himself stood for elections and garnered 600 votes losing sadly to Vyjyanthimala. Economic and Political Weekly June 1, 2002 2163</page><page sequence="2">It is the unelected philosopher I propose to discuss. II Ram Manohar Lohia the socialist leader once wrote a fascinating piece on the two models for modern India, Mohandas Gandhi and Visvesveraya. He saw them as ideal citizens and emphasised the com- petitive complementarity between them. One was the author of 'Industrialise or Perish', the other of 'Industrialise and Perish'. Seshadri's ideas pushed this per- spective even further. He saw in each the idea of the autobiography as an experi- ment. Gandhi wrote of his life as an experiment on truth and Visvesveraya wrote everything as if it were a scientific report. The autobiography with the body as vessel and the self as experiment itself becomes a laboratory, a thought experiment. Seshadri wanted to see each life as a set of un- finished hypothesis. It is only when a life is incomplete that it is a part of the whole. Seshadri felt an autobiography as an ex- periment prevents it from being an icono- graphy or a hagiography. Otherwise India becomes a demographic anomaly, a popu- lation that makes no mistakes from Shivaji to G Parthasarathi. Science allows for that confident open-ended humility. When the self becomes an experiment, the standard dualisms of western science are broken or re-threaded in interesting ways. Bruno Latour once made a fascinat- ing Archimedean statement 'Give me a laboratory and I will change the world.' In this sentence, subject and object are still estranged, the observer and observed still distant. The experiment as an existential act is still on the other. To this the Seshadrian reply would have been, 'Give me a laboratory and I will change myself.' One could respond similarly to the ethics of the Descartian meditation, 'I think therefore I am.' It becomes 'I think of the other, therefore I am.' The 'I' of science is a denatured I. But there is the I of evolution, of cosmology, of genealogy, of civilisation, of citizen- ship. The reductionism of science and its power begins with the impoverishment of the 'I', the self in science. For Seshadri, an autobiography begins an experiment in the construction of the self and the self he wants to unravel is the brahminic, scientific self. In an everyday sense Seshadri knew his laboratory was called 'Iyer and Company'. He was deeply aware of his brahminism and deeply critical of it. He wanted to sustain it, reinvent it, and exorcise it. He realised the deep affinity between brahminism and science, an af- filiation as deep as that between Protes- tantism and science immortalised in the essays of Max Weber. In both, there is an effort to look at that devastating combi- nation of repression and creativity we dub as science. Seshadri and I used to talk about brahmin Madras for hours. I didn't interview him. We gossiped, compared notes, talked Qf intellectual pregnancies and philosophical corns. There was aloneness in each that the other recognised. I remember a line in Bar-Olman's book on physics where there was an inexplicable statement, about sci- ence as a solace, a balm for grief. It had been underlined almost tentatively, almost shyly. We were both preoccupied with gene- alogies, felt generations of time and multiplicities of time in us. We were brahmins. There is a crudity to the fact, even an obscenity we recognised. To be a brahmin is almost unforgivable in MGR's Madras. I remember a colleague of mine, a Lohiate Socialist, fat, in his forties, raving against brahmin hegemony. Seshadri lis- tened quietly and then asked "How many generations of public service will exoner- ate me for being a brahmin?" An ethical self was confronting a political cutout. Yet Seshadri knew he was a double anachro- nism, someone who didn't fit in the ghettoised world of brahmin Madras. He was fascinated by elite brahmins, who were the scientific hawks of the nation state, and who were also perpetual emigres of the mind, who saw San Francisco and Princeton as an annexe, an upmarket extension of Adyar, Madras. He also knew that in a deep and fundamental way we were the last Victorians. He knew that any critique' of Tamil brahmin science must begin with the grand- fathers. He saw grandfathers as a heuristic, a halfway house between genealogy and autobiography. He used to make me talk about my family and about Bengali scien- tists. We used to chuckle wickedly about a photograph of the Calcutta School of Science, which includes Raman, Ramanathan, Venkatesvaran, Ganesan, Krishnan, Ramdas and yes there was a Bannerji and Ghosh thrown in. Talking about science at that time we classified scientists in terms of two musical meta- phors - the piano and the violin. The piano was classically western. It stands outside Indian culture and yet has a niche in it. Popular culture captures it best. When there is something everyday but western the piano is all there. Think of all 'the happy birthday to you' and 'I love you' in Hindi films - which desper- ately need a piano. Yet it remains western. The violin is a hybrid. It is something Carnatic music absorbed and imbibed creatively. The violin represents the west we had taken and domesticated. For Seshadri, westernisation was not just the three-piece suit. It was the violin. In the idiom of science, Homi Bhabha was the piano; C V Raman was the violin. Yet neither actually produced a grammar for a modern Indian science and this is what Seshadri sought. There was something distressing, even authoritarian about science. It was a com- bination of the authoritarian and the au- thoritative. It was a kind of repressive masculinity. Let me emphasise science in brahmin India was not a theory of method. It was more, what Richard Rorty once called a collection of virtues. Live life iWn a certain way and the scientific becomes possible. It was a domestic civics, a gram- mar, hygiene, a ritual for living. Science in Tamil brahmin India was definitely male. What marked it off was that ghastly invention called home sci- ence. Physics was male, home science was female. My aunts practised home science or social work and worshipped physics. Home science and social work were the 'oikos' and 'polis' of a woman's life. Home science was to physics as female was to male. The women of that generation were talented, driven, close to science and deeply voyeuristic about it. Science was like their husbands, contiguous and strangely distant. Science in Tamil brahmin India pro- duced the bureaucratic ascetic. It was a service in that double sense Indians gave the English word. Science, especially physics was a sublimated field, a non- erotic domain. It was not so much truth but about certainty, predictability and correctness that mattered. There was an imperious intolerance about it, an authoritarianism articulated in linear time. In this world, 'Be scientific' and 'be good' were synonymous statements but what bothered one were the qualities of good- ness and science. Let me cite some of the stories Seshadri and I collected. The first was about my grandfather. I remember my father had brought me an electric train from Germany. I was about seven then. I wrote to my grandfather about it, claimed it ran at 500 miles an hour. Pat came the reply. "Your electric train could not possibly run at that speed. Please check and let me know the correct speed.' I think my disgust with science began that day 2164 Economic and Political Weekly June 1, 2002</page><page sequence="3">with grandfathers who calibrated fanta- sies. I secretly dreamt my grandfather and other scientists were clocks, or at least timetables. There was an arid precision to life that bothered me. In fact science was like table manners, a ritual correctness in life where morality yielded to routine. Clock time was central to their lives. When they went to office they put on their science, when they came home they put on their caste and their ritual clericalism. Time and honesty were the two spokes of their lives. In fact, the presentation of the watch was as important a ritual into manhood as the sacred thread. The clock was aridly male and it didn't menstruate. Te clock was secular and utterly indifferent to all other times. In constructing the civics for the scientist and of his surrogates the clerk and the accountant, we swallowed the variety of times. The Republic of Brahminic science was constructed on clock time, like the plan, the laboratory and the calendar. In fact Seshadri and I believed that the national movement was all about clocks. Remember Gandhi's clock, his punctual- ity and Nehru's obsession with plans. I remember a cousin of mine who went to meet S Chandrasekhar. He rushed in full of expectation to meet his uncle and was stunned to find the latter upset that he had not made an appointment. What I want to emphasise is the link between this disciplinary body, its time and its honesty and science as it was constructed by brahmin-Brahmo India. I remember Ashis Nandy's lovely story about P C Mahalanobis's father. The father of Indian planning was then only a child. He was travelling with his father to Burdwan. In those days, like today, you could travel on a half-ticket if you were under 12 years old. The train was chugging happily when Mahalanobis senior suddenly pulled the chain and demanded that his son get down immediately. The fellow passengers were flabbergasted and asked the father what the son had done? He replied that Prasanta was 12 a few minutes ago and was trav- elling under false pretences. Fortunately, common sense came to the rescue. The passengers suggested that the father should pay the other half and the journey pro- ceeded happily. What fascinated Seshadri and me was the strange stiffness of this generation, a definition of the body and the mind that it projected on to public space. It was a generation that dealt with love out of pipettes and loved the Emergency because the trains ran on time. It is a question we must ask. "Why did so many Tamil brahmin scientists love the Emergency?" We for- mulated the question in a different way. Science we felt was based on the impov- erished body, on an impoverishment of time, and an aridness of sexuality. Seshadri felt he wanted to create a science that was muscular, not machismo, a science that thought with its hands, a science that was more sexual and sensual, a science that was sensitive to suffering. He felt that there was a connection bet- ween the autobiography as experiment and the nation state as one. One remembers the old idea of Visvesveraya of nation building, character building, dam building as iso- morphic activities and Seshadri hinted that something had gone wrong with all three. Seshadri felt that the roots and the theatre for such an examination lay in science. I remember we were discussing the IITs and I told him about one of my cousins who complained "Who wants to marry an IIT engineer? They were so dull." Seshadri described IIT as "colourless, odourless and lethal." He added that the IITs were India's "favourite cash crop". For Seshadri, the autobiography as experiment was projected into a theory of state. He argued that the IITs like science suffered from the trauma of Gandhian untruth. He felt there was a discrepancy between self and other, method and life style and we can analyse this in terms of the dreams of energy in India. Ill Years ago in 1992, when Seshadri and I were at Amherst, we tried to articulate an aphoristic statement of what we were looking for and I phrased it as follows. If one were asked what were the beautiful and creative aspects of India I would answer our music, our dance and our agriculture. We have 40,000 varieties of rice that is like 40,000 varieties of dreaming. And then if we were to ask ourselves what is the dullest aspect of India, our answer would be our modern professions, our lawyers, our economists, our social scientists, our bureaucrats, and our scientists. Our search now is to make the latter enact the dance of the former and acquire a civilisational quality, which strengthens both. C V Seshadri was particularly concerned about science and democracy. We were fascinated by a hint first provided by the Yale biologist, Harold Morowitz in his Wine and Roses. Mdrowitz was asked to write an essay on the American Bicenten- nial. He began by stating that the greatest document America produced was its constitution. He then asked what is the second greatest document and he answered that it was the Gibbs equations on thermo- dynamics. He also recalled that Gibbs' work was published entirely by the Con- necticut Academy of Sciences and that America's greatest scientist always re- mained a provincial genius. It was the juxtaposition between the American constitution and the work on thermodynamics that fascinated me. I wondered what would have happened if Gibbs had read the American constitution. How would energetics of the constitution contribute to a theory of equality or jus- tice? What would be the outlines of a similar exercise in India? A simple introduction to the politics of energy in India can begin with Jawaharlal Nehru's off-quoted statement that 'dams and laboratories are the temples of modern India.' These temples of energy, these creations of science were indices of modernity. Reified, dams became the health of the nation. A threat to the dam or a nuclear reactor became a threat to state. When Medha Patkar and the anti-dam activists protested, they were arrested under Defence of India rules. A threat to the dam was a threat to the security of India. When a Praful Bidwai or a Dhirendra Sharma criticised nuclear energy, they are seen as anti-scientific and anti-national. Today the destruction of the mosque is seen as less sacrilegious than the destruction of the Narmada dam or Tarapore. The greening ,of democracy in India must begin by breaking the social contract between State- Science-Economic development. Under- lying all three is the metaphor of energy. Jawaharlal Nehru's statement on dams is only a variant of Lenin's more genocidal dictum "Soviets+Electricity = Communism". Energy provided not only a rationale for the state but a grid of discipline. Energy was a poetic metaphor, a polyvalent term, at once work, power, potential, vigour, effect; it is occult, spiritual, kinetic. What scientists and modern economics did was to desemanticise the term, break its varied meanings into one politically correct word, and transform an icon into an index; a multivalent possibility into one univalent quantitative concept. Simultaneously it became a disciplinary term; energy had to be measured, planned, channelised. What threatened excess or uncontrolled flow was now a controlled grid. Dam, reactor, labo- ratory were the pilgrimages of this new geography. Discipline and energy became deeply linked and stratified. So energy became transformed into what the state and the plan considered it to be and Economic and Political Weekly June 1, 2002 2165</page><page sequence="4">Petroleum, Nuclear, Hydel, Electric now constituted the alphabet of the energy of the new state. Expert energy was official energy. Energy generated by the people, the world of dung and fuel-wood was not considered immaculate and scientific. There was a further inversion where Indian politicians frequently spoke of harnessing the energy of the people. Energy, discipline and time are deeply linked. The plan was the language of the nation state. The nation state was in historical time, linear and plannable. Within the nation state, autobiography and history were lined up to provide the time of the nation state. The multiplicities of time that civilisations provided, peasant time, woman time, body time, time of seasons, time of cycles, geo- logical time was lost to the time of moder- nity, to the economic time of the plan, to the historicity of the nation state. It was not coincidental that Meghnad Saha was India's greatest advocate of calendrical reform and an advocate of the Metric System. India's other great planner Visvesvaraya was also obsessed with energy. His Mem- oirs of a Working Life is a remarkable document. For Visvesveraya character building, nation building, dam building were isomorphic activities. They were all aspects of engineering that needed disci- pline and what is discipline but the control of energy. You harness the individual, the dam, and the nation state. You plan for progress. Mahatma Gandhi realised in a. deep and fundamental way the danger of such a preoccupation with energy as an index of material progress. He warned, "the control over the hidden forces of nature enables every American to have 33 slaves. Repeat the process in India and every Indian will be 33 times a slave" and he was right. Energy has been the Trojan horse through which development has completed its bloodless conquest. In the late seventies when scientists like Hussein Zaheer and Adinath Lahiri requested Indira Gandhi to move away from the petroleum base of industrialisation we find the first recognitions of this impasse. But this was more reactive and desperate than system- atically epistemic. To systematise this, one must begin with a geneology of words. For Seshadri con- temporary constitutions like modern west- ern science were Judeo-Christian docu- ments. One must not allow for the im- maculate innocence of words and realise there is more violence tucked in words like health, poverty, and energy than in the worst annals of crime. Once you introduce words such as history, development, progress into poverty and suffering, you economise and scienticise it on Judeo- Christian time. For Seshadri it was the Judeo-Christian nature of modern texts that was a bit unsettling. Whether it is thermodynamics or the detective novel, one had to realise the Christian nature of the exercise. Con- sider the classic detective novel. It is a scientific text built on a Judeo Christian frame. Murder is a violation of order and the detective restores it. The detective in the text plays God. Remember the last chapters. All the characters are assembled around the table with the detective at the head. The whole act is modelled on the Last Supper. Seshadri's work is not an attack on Christianity but a critique of those who fail to explore the tacit knowledges underlying their life worlds. He said that Einstein was fond of saying that scientists imbibed their concepts with mother's milk. The Constitution, like the detective novel, has a theology. Our Constitution today is a coalition of documents. It includes the calendar, the Plan, the Metric System and the syllabus. They provide the standardised categories of time and space on which the legal constitution is anchored. The four together constitute the manifestos of eco- nomics and modernity. The violence of India is present in the act of creation itself for the citizen is born as an 'economic' man. Time as plan, as calendar, as standards had already created a Procrustean bed and the battle between right and left was only a battle between competing modernisations. Seshadri re- marks that the plan like the constitution is a moral document. Utility and efficiency are moral terms and it is the nature of this morality that we failed to examine. In fact, he echoed Arthur Koestler' s statement that the idea of a value-free science was the most pernicious myth of our time. Science as a value neutral philosophy became a paradigm for the market, for functional society in general and for amorality as a governing principle. He pleads for a re- embedding of India into a civilisation, a cosmology and its ecologies. Seshadri's approach to this crisis was two-pronged. The first and more celebrated was his critique of thermodynamics. The second caught mainly in unpublished essays was an attempt to provide science as a sacrament for democracy. There was a sense that India and China were the two civilisations that could withstand the cru- dities of globalisation. There was also a sense, a confidence that India was the clearinghouse for ideas across the world, that any idea however dull and deadened would be composted in the humus of Indian civilisation. The tragedy however was that the cre- ation myth of India as a modem society was postulated on a set of dualisms, of vivisections. The first of these was the separation of the nation state from the sense of a civilisation as sources of resis- tance. A civilisation suggests Seshadri incorporates more notions of time than the nation. A nation state exists in linear time. Civilisations have heritage, tradition and memory. Nation states only produce his- tory books. Nation states are modernistic and see civilisations as backdrops or read them negatively as in the term, the Hindu rate of growth. They become scientific projects that place their societies on the incline plane of history. The second dualism was the partition of India where we created an other, which con- stantly lead to reciprocal impoverishment. The third dualism is the one that we rarely recognise. It was the inauguration of our constitution that disembedded our society from its ecologies. We not only dislocated ourselves from our civilisation but from the very notion of nature. Our very act of citizenship was a semantic impove- rishment, a product more of the Indian Standards Institution than our philosophers. Seshadri reminded us that constitutions, like laboratories, are thought experiments. The "as if' nature of the assumptions is never fully suspended and secondly they are subject to constant and playful revisions. For Seshadri, the Indian Constitution like any other modern constitution is an anthropomorphic document. It tacitly acknowledges the superiority of man in the universe. Seshadri and other biologists have maintained that "this is by no means universally true and there are examples of bird, insect or animal communities excel- ling us in some attribute or other." It is this anthropic arrogance that led Lynn Margulis to demand a trade union to represent the role of bacteria. The Constitution tacitly allows for mastery and use of nature. Nature is made for man's use and secularised as a 're- source'. The covenant with life is broken. This is important in a civilisational sense for science must remind the constitution of the ecological and cosmological integu- ments in which a society is embedded. A Seshadrian would also argue that the constitution is a pre-Copernican document 2166 Economic and Political Weekly June 1, 2002</page><page sequence="5">in some senses. The heliocentrism of the Copernican revolution was not a complete process. Historians of science often talk of the great process of decentring that Copernicus, Darwin, Freud and Marx inaugurated. One disrupted geocentrism, one questioned man as a special creation, the latter two redefined the nature of his rationality. But if one thinks about it the relation of man to the sun is still to be worked out. As Seshadri put it "upto the year 1700, all economies were solar driven. For all times past and the future living beings are only solar driven. So the ques- tion is do we want to put our nuclear reactor 50 kilometres away at Kalpakkam or 93 x 106 miles away in the sun?" Seshadri added that any constitution as a cosmology and ecology must face the two Copernican problems. Firstly, there is no special place for man in the universe. Secondly there is no special epoch for man in the universe. I must make one last point in this regard. Once one sees a constitution as a bundle of cosmologies, contracts, ecologies, cov- enants and cycles, it becomes as it were an engineering aesthetics, a question of process design. Once one sees a constitu- tion as a multiplicity of times and their recognition it acquires almostfractal like quality. "Fractals are scale invariant. It is a structural idea. You have arrows and cycles at the same time." The question of the fractal allows one to see the constitu- tion as a kind of process design. V Balaji once gave an idiosyncratic example. "Have you read The Last of the Mohicans. Re- member the Indian who saves the Whites. I forget his name. They thought he was crazy. When the settlers were surrounded by fire and cornered, he decides to light another fire. Remember what he said; only I can light it. It is my judgment of the direction of wind flow. We need such concepts. There are so many switches in the cycle you can identify. You rely on local judgement. There is also a new sense of the relation between macrocosm and microcosm. The larger system always gets reflected in the smaller." Seshadri's vision of a biomass society was an attempt to respond to this problem. IV For Seshadri the idea of a biomass society was not anchored on a second rate science for a second rate society. He evaded many of the political traps associated with the intermediate technology movement. He repeatedly emphasised that the idea of biomass demanded a new epistemology and a reinvention of citizenship. He also added that the concern with biomass so- cieties is not only a third world discourse but emerged at two levels. There was firstly the northern discourse that began with the oil crisis and the discussion of the Limits to Growth model and also the discussion of the need for soft energy paths in a nuclear world. There was a radicalism to the discourse, a critique of industrialism where to paraphrase Patrick Geddes 'the economics of the leaf and the economics of metals was in opposition.' But sadly the radical edge of such a discourse became co-opted into the technocratic ecocratic discourse called sustainability. In the third world biomass as a discourse arose mainly as a challenge to the surreal science of elites who worshipped electri- city. It was a crisis of wood and cooking. But the biomass discourse began as a radical critique of industrialism at two levels. A theory of limits became a praxis of creative possibilities. We realise today that oil, the green revolution and modern medicine cannot deliver. Given this the local, the traditional, the futuristic - all become sites of innovation. The radical possibilities of a biomass as an epistemology can be easily suppressed. For example in anthologies of energy, biomass is categorised as a way of life, of societies outside the pale of industrialism. It is usually chapter 10 or 12 of a textbook on energy, a sidebet following the pre- occupations with nuclear, oil, hydel or even wind energy. It is seen as residual. There is simultaneously a split in the construction of the globalisation regime. Oil and nuclear is for the industrial and biomass is for the societies of Africa and Asia that might be triaged out of history. Biomass then becomes the discourse of the defeated, the third world and the third rate. Consider how the regime of biomass appears in spy thrillers that Seshadri was so fond of. Into the happy life of western industrialism appear the oil sheikhs, the OPEC cartels and the urban guerrilla. Constructed simultaneously with the oil crisis is the wood crisis. The pictures of the woman carrying wood, the guerrilla in the forest and the oil sheikh become the three archetypal figures of the crisis. Yet we should not succumb to such a reading because it not only predetermines narra- tives but also creates pre-emptive futures. We have to remember that the Vietnam War represents the victory and resistance of a biomass society over an industrial high calorie regime. Seshadri repeatedly emphasised that biomass is the conver- sation of the leaf talking to its ancient friends coal and oil, establishing similar- ities and differences in their common genealogy to the sun. One must emphasise some dangers here. The first is the'sheer economism of discourse and the danger of conventional economic categories and thought. The sun is not a conventional factory. It is not too keen to subject itself to man-made time and organisation. Secondly biomass should not be reduced to the language of scarcity and crisis. There are shortages, there is poverty but biomass need not be reduced to a discourse on scarcity. Nicholas Xenos' comments are apt in this context. In his Scarcity and Modernity Xenos observes that the European 18th century saw the invention of both the steam engine and of scarcity. Scarcity as anthropologists have pointed out is seen as episodic in most societies. "It signified a period of insuf- ficiency or dearth. This remained the principal usage until the late nineteenth century, when neo-classical economics made the scarcity postulate its founda- tion." The notion of scarcity also opens out a Pandora's box of technological fixes, where problems of biomass need bio- technology and then the entire spectrum of biotechnology gets reduced to genetic engineering. Seshadri explained Biomass is a word for people. It smacks "of the ordinary and the non-mechanical. Com- pare the tree to a factory, or a cow to a reactor. Like the people it is not amenable to efficiency and control in a factory sense. You can't boss over the science of photosynthesis." The state thus has problems with bio- mass in the way it does not have with electricity. Electricity is a disciplinary grid but biomass offers little ground for collectivisation to "turn the stinking pastry of the ordinary people into a tasty pie by trainers, educators, the masters." You can't say Soviets+Electrification = Communism in a biomass society. Unless, you are a Pol Pot. It is around biomass that the resistance to the state can come into being. Biomass reopens the debate in a tremendous way. Firstly energy forms like oil, nuclear or large dams are state oriented while bio- mass speaks the language of civil society. Secondly by linking life and death in the idea of the cycle, it brackets the idea of obsolescence, preventing it from being read as a universalising process. It brackets the idea of progress in its linear form by offering the multiplicity of Economic and Political Weekly June 1, 2002 2167</page><page sequence="6">times that democracy so desperately needs. Biomass also recalls the idea of the commons and particularly the idea of cognitive justice. The two concepts are closely interlinked. The idea of the com- mons is not just an amalgamation, a mapping of physical and natural resources. It is also the diversity of skills required to understand, access and dwell within it. Seshadri dubbed it "a commons of the mind". It is in this context that we must emphasise that rights often speak the economistic language of access. Speaking a language of rights in a biomass society only leads to conceptual inflation, to a proliferation of rights including the rights to food, fuel, and employment without tying or connecting them at a moral or epistemic level. The language of rights, particularly in its individualistic- economistic language becomes partly alien to a biomass society creating in fact the tragedy of the commons. One does not seek to abandon it but to trans- late it into the language of community and cosmos. In that sense the politics of a biomass society goes beyond the standard discourses of the French revolution, both of the CommunistManifesto or the Rights of Man. Firstly it goes beyond the discourses of liberty and equality to an emphasis on fraternity not merely between communi- ties but between man and nature. But it should not be seen only as an ecolacy of nature but of technology. It reads liberty, equality and fraternity as the first triangle of modern politics. But it counterposes to it a second triangle of pollution, waste and obsolescence and it reads it in terms of a community of multiple times. The notion of the cycle becomes fundamental here. "When Seshadri introduced the centrality of food, he knew that food chains exist in cycles. Through food you can see the interrelationship between a wide variety of complex systems. Terrestrial. Aquatic. Cosmic. A variety of cycles interface and Doc wanted to track the process through energy." It is around the idea of cycles that the discourse on waste, pollution and obsoles- cence is constructed. Seshadri's idea of shakthi was an attempt to develop quality markers for creating a grammar for this discourse. Seshadri, the early Seshadri, talked in aphorisms and epigrams. I re- member him grinning and observing "pol- lution is someone else's profit" or that "one man's waste is another man's re- source." But these were notjust pretty little proverbs. Consider the popular idea of recycling. He said, "You can't recycle waste without violating the second law of thermo- dynamics. The question of recycling has to be looked at in this perspective for all waste is useful in some context. For Seshadri it was more fruitful to recycle ideas instead of things. He provided the example of sheet metal stamping. "Circular blanks of metal are stamped out of metal sheets leaving behind perfo- rated sheets which the manufacturers characterise as waste. But one man's waste is another man's resource. The perforated sheets are used by several poor people as fencing, structural elements in housing, tracks for paths, etc. What has been re- cycled is neither material nor energy. Only the idea. A waste has been turned into a resource by perceiving it differently. A low value high entropy perforated sheet be- comes a high value low entropy fence, tracks and such by recycling ideas. The process also adds value locally." "The classic recycling option would be to melt down the perforated sheets and then re-roll them. The material is recycled at tremendous cost. Idea recycling is far less energy intensive than material re- cycling." Recycling of idea is the forte of the squatter and scavenger. The Indian slum becomes the great laboratory for recycling ideas. For the wasted people of our states, wastes and nature are the only resources left for them to build on. Only these resources are available outside the commercial mainstream. The idea of cycles substitutes and goes beyond the alchemical limits of the per- petual machine. In fact the idea of cycles is disappearing in modern agriculture. As one Japanese scientist noted "modern agriculture has replaced most of the cycles in nature by products of manufacturing, especially with chemical fertilisers and petroleum products. These are not com- patible with the cycles of nature." Seshadri's still incomplete idea of 'shakthi' was developed as a quality marker to understand such processes. V Balaji observed that "it helped one redesign processes, identify the real wastes in the system like the amount of pure water used in flush toilets in western countries, or the consumption of processed water in chemi- cal industrial processes. Viewed this way the efficiency of the thermal plants may be scaled down by 50 per cent." "The notion of shakthi is scale invariant. It can range from the depth of the ocean to the upper atmosphere. It can look at the interaction of two microbes in a biogas digester." Balaji added it is an engineer's understanding of thermodynamics. It is like a 'thanedar's' understanding of thermo- dynamics rather than a commissioner's. It sensitises you to the real costs of water and nutrients, say, in an agricultural process as for instance the over-application of water and fertilisers in hybrid seed technology. Shakthi would give you a knowledge intensive rather than an input intensive approach to agriculture. You apply that many grams of fertiliser at thattime on that place. A 'vaidyar's' approach rather than that of agri-business. But biomass is not merely a discourse on nature and the environment; it is a plea for a new pedagogy of citizenship. Seshadri felt that the state was not going to wither away or was it something easily compostible. The more interesting chal- lenge for lateral thinking in politics was to reinvent nature, citizenship and civil society. In this context he and Joe Thomas would often talk of the Juliflora almost as a fable. I remember one of the first times Joe and I were having tea outside the MCRC gate. Joe showed me a beautiful garden fence, exquisitely green, trimmed and beautiful. "The prosopis Juliflora", he announced. No compere could have been prouder and more delighted. The Juliflora, a mesquite, provides 40 per cent of Madras firewood. The irony is it is not a creation of state forest policy but an inadvertent introduction and it grew despite the state. One felt that Seshadri wanted the Julifloras of citizenship. Deep down Seshadri defined himself as an inventor. He saw invention as a process of thinking with the hands and held it constituted the basic core of citizenship. As Joe once said that "for Doc, there were two inventors, Bucky Fuller and Gandhi, and more and more, he veered to the latter". The Gandhian notion of invention had a sense of communities fighting obsoles- cence inventively. In that sense khadi was not a Luddite act of resistance but a theory of invention and inventiveness. Within such a perspective the problematic of the French Revolution raised two inco.nplete problems. The first and more visible was balancing the relation of individual and community between the competing de- mands of liberty, equality and fraternity. The less visible problem articulated more in the Cultural Revolution was the relation between citizen and scientist. The Cultural Revolution posited it as the opposition of red and expert. Liberal theory saw the citizen as consumer of science. The citizen is merely a consumer with a political preference and faith in science. Seshadri 2168 Economic and Political Weekly June 1, 2002</page><page sequence="7">like Gandhi dreamt of the Citizen-Scien- tist. Every citizen has to be a craftsman and an inventor. Gandhi was a master citizen and inventor. He was craftsman, cook (a horrible cook), weaver, scavenger, lawyer, surveyor, drainage expert, psy- chologist, a theologian of Christianity, a practising Hindu and his own Havelock Ellis and Masters and Johnson. One must emphasise that inventiveness demands irony and humour. Jamnalal Bajaj once donated a car to Gandhi's ashram, which refused to function after a while. A pair of bullocks pulled it on occasions. Gandhi called it his own Ox-FORD. It is in this context that Seshadri argued for a new pedagogy for citizenship building on Garrett Hardin's work, Filters against Folly and John Paulos's book on Innumeracy. Citizenship as craftsmanship also needs ideas of numeracy and literacy. Develop- ment like citizenship involves not only access, but also competence and judge- ment. "Development involves vast trans- fers of knowledge. Before we undertake this, it is important to transmit the science of knowledge that underpins the knowl- edge we transfer." Loosely, numeracy is the ability to see discrete entities in a connected whole or a continuum. Those lacking in numeracy usually possess two kinds of deficiency. The first is the inability to see discreteness in continuity. The second is to see only discreteness and not to perceive the con- tinuum at all. Both deficiencies can create survival problems in a developing society. Deficiencies of the first kind: (i) This would include all tribals who gather fuelwood thinking it is a free good, un- aware that energy has a value in the market place and who are gradually being denied access to the traditional resource of fuelwood. (ii) All people who do not realize the difference between rearing five children and seven. (iii) All roads in south India are used as solar dryers. However, roads do not belong to the village any more. They belong to the lorries, buses and cars of a larger system. The enormous wastage of grain and cere- als due to traffic is not accounted for- if it were then people perhaps would arrange for a better drying system. One must emphasise that innumeracy is not just a lack of arithmetical skill. It demands tacit knowledges, the awareness of resource limitation, and a feel forquantity and its allocation that our people lack.He then talked of deficiencies ofthe second kind. Deficiencies of the second kind: (i) These include all people who thought Silent Valley was equal to so many mega- watts of hydel power. (ii) All people who do not realise that over 50 per cent of the total energy consumed in the country are consumed in the cooking stove. (iii) All the people who think that because non-commercial energy cannot be ac- counted for in our theories, it need not be accounted for. This is saying that discretisation of the money market is the only part of the continuum that exists. (iv) "All people who consider develop- ment as increase in average per capita income." Numeracy is an absolute essen- tial for survival in a developing society. It is also linked to time in a significant way. "Time is an essential constituent of numeracy, in fact time is the prime numeraire." This problem of time, science and development constitutes one of the fundamental issues of exploitation. Once the opposition between literacy and numeracy is understood, we can re- cognise that democracy in India cannot operate on standardised time. Standardised time belongs to the Benthamite Panopticon. Standardised time emasculates a series of vernacular times in a process called economic development. Seshadri observes that the Gregorian Calendar is a measure of time. Peasant time is time. Confusing time with its measure is one of the greatest tragedies that have befallen the poor in the tropics. "The tax structure and collection, the education system, the weekly and yearly holidays are all tied to an artificial system that bear no relation to the cycles of the peasant and those of husbandry. The 'oestrus window' of his cattle, the 'plough- ing windows' of his fields, the synchrony of crop harvest have no place in printed calendars. The latter measure concepts of time far removed from nature befitting Roman emperors of bygone days." The East India Company used calendar time as the most potent tool to separate the farmer from his land. The time of modernity is an attempt to impose Cartesian time on a basically a- Cartesian people. Concepts of time ex- pressed independent of human existence fall into Cartesian categories. Peasant time is lived time, the time of the body, the time of nature's cycles. Modernity imposes a mind-body separation through time. The digital watch becomes an extreme example. Time is no longer a continuum here. It is discretised and attached to a number system. Consider the negative discrimination that time imposes on the following people. The educational calendar is designed with the children of city office-goers in mind. The monsoon generally comes in June when school starts for the year. The question arises: should the farmer send his able- bodied children to school or should they assist him on the farm. It is not surprising that 8-10 year old children have the highest dropout rates. I have hinted enough to state that bio- mass provides a new epistemology for democracy demanding a Durkheimian approach which looks seriously at time and number and its links to plurality. We now link science to democracy in a more specific sense. The statement on the sci- entific temper fails on grounds of literacy. It demands to be playfully replaced by atentative axiomatics of science, as a sacrament for democracy. Seshadri begins with language. He observes that statements on the scientific temper become overt statements that ignore the tacit knowledges underlying science. He claimed that development has its own epistemology. Therefore it is important that we grasp the knowledges we transfer. It is-in this context that he emphasises the importance of language. I) (i) Language is important for lan- guages can be exploitative. (ii) The language of science and tech- nology is English. From English, if at all, we translate science and technology and development into our languages. (iii) Thus the scientific temper is to be created in this country through this language. (iv) But who is to temper the English language? England has the traditions of a small island that had to exploit the outside world for their benefit. (v) The semantics of western science and technology is by and large growth- oriented. This semantics is not helpful for resource conservation, or for resource distribution. (vi) The technology and therefore its semantics are ultimately related to the market economy and the language of market forces. Seshadri asked, "How can such a lang- uage be used for the aid of a people who are completely outside the market economy? We think there is a need for a less exploitative linguistics. This system may be symbolic or pictorial and need not be related to existing developmental languages. This language should be understood by all Indians." Economic and Political Weekly June 1, 2002 2169</page><page sequence="8">II) Science must govern the choice of technique. (There is no immaculate inno- cence here.) Science and technology have always been and will always be the pursuit of exploitable knowledge with all the artefacts of such exploitation. All we can do is seek to minimise these effects. III) (I) A belief system should not be independent of lifestyle. Lifestyle is co- eval with the technology that enables its practice. Violating this belief leads to the trauma of thermodynamics or Gandhian truth inconsistency. Science can no longer settle for observer participancy. It must be linked to questions of lifestyle. If not (a) Technology will become a substitute for ideology (b) Technological imperatives may lead you to emphasise the wrong value system. IV) (i) "Indians should have a lifestyle that is evolved for Indian conditions. This includes resource constraints, disparities in society, overall lack of complex modern systems and the fact that the third world does not have the fourth, fifth and sixth world to exploit any more." (ii) Science links lifestyle to ecolacy. We must ask the question democratically and scientifically: "What level should we live at? Is it 5,000 kilocalories a day or 10,000 kilocalories a day? This number must be arrived at by consensus." V) Science must be linked to citizenship. A citizen is a person of knowledge. No science can be deskilling. Knowledge is a commons. Science must address itself to the question of diversity where life forms are disappearing, whether it is one variety of plants a day, or one language from a week. Paradigms must be linked to lifestyles to create ground rules for citizenship. Such ground rules should be seen as Gadeken experiments. Gadeken experiments reveal the nature of choices, the knowledge base and their link to lifestyles. C V Seshadri did not complete his axiomatics of a compassionate science. He was deeply influenced by Sam Neillson's Nobel Symposium 'The place of value in a world of facts', particularly by Linus Pauling's argument that science must be based on an axiomatics of suffering. Yet it is necessary to emphasise that the text of suffering must remain polyvocal enough so that it is not reduced to innumerate indices of poverty or nutrition as calories. Yet he also emphasised that the constitu- tion of India must guarantee a basic daily metabolic intake to all its citizens. The Seshadrian experiment remains incomplete. The laboratory stands but as an unhappy shell. The hypotheses and wishful thinking, the daydreams he con- spired to construct with Joe, Jeejibhai and Balaji are now memories. What we need today is remember that he emphasised that memory is reinvention. We can turn him into a monument. We have to reinvent him and quarrel with his ideas in new and playful ways. He felt a sense of defeat in his last years, a sense of the em- bourgeoisement of radicalism, a feeling that NGOs had added to the overall sense of cynicism. He wanted more oddballs, eccentrics, dissenters and classicists as citi- zens. I remember his comments during a seminar at the Max Mueller Bhawan in Madras. He was complaining there were not enough cranks in room. "Have you read Schumacher's comments on the crank?" he asked. Schumacher said a crank is a simple everyday instrument and yet every time it is turned around it produces revolutions. This essay then is a tribute to a classicist scientist, a crank who wanted to reinvent democracy, a crank who saw autobiogra- phy, the laboratory and the constitution as thought experiments, a visionary who felt India could transform the current idiocies of globalisation into something life-giving and a crank who believed that Tamil brahmin Madras had something radical and creative to contribute. Ml% [This essay based on a C V Seshadri lecture is the story of a great dissenting scientist. Seshadri was director of Murugappa Chettiar Research Centre at Taramani in Chennai. A small collection of shacks masquerading as buildings, it became the life centre of dissenting, innovative ideas in science, technology and democracy from the seventies to the nineties. This essay is part of a larger study of these exponents in democracy and science.] PROGRAMME COORDINATOR Centre for Youth and Social Development (CYSD) is a leading autonomous development organisation working with the deprived and the disprivileged towards the goal of people centered development.
