<plain_text><page sequence="1">388 SOME ASPECTS OF SPIRIT WORiSHIP AMONGST THE MILANO OF SARAWAK. BY A. E. LAWRENCE, Assistant Resident of Mukah, Sarawak, and JOHN HEWITT, B.A., Curator of Sarawak Museum. [WITH PLATE XXXIV.] General Remarks on MAlilano. THE Milano of Sarawak are a tribe of people now occupying the coastal regions of North-West Borneo, from the Rejang delta on the south-west up to the Baram mouth on the north-east. On the whole they are a fairly pure race, very distinct from the neighbouring Sea Dayaks or Malays, though the northern Milano have to a certain extent mixed with other tribes. Their language is very widely different from Malay, but has many words in common with the various languages of the more aboriginal races of the archipelago. Unlike other natives of Borneo, they have a settled industry-the worLing of sago, which, excluding the sea fishing common to all natives living on the coast, constitutes their only occupation. It is not certain how long these Milano have occupied the coastal regions: there are traditions stating that they came from the interior, but this gives us no sure indication of the date when they left it: however, it seems probable that this must have been several centuries ago, and, indeed, their tradition places the date of their establishment on the coast before the time of the conversion of Brunei to Islam, which occurred centuries ago. For a long time they have had relations with Brunei as their governing power. From Brunei was introduced a certain civilization-e.g., in clothing-but this does not appear to have appreciably modified their notions of religion and morality, excepting within recent times, when the Islamism of Brunei has succeeded in grafting itself on to the old religion, which it is very slowly supplanting, Notions of Spirits and Ghosts. Very characteristic of the Milano is their intense belief in a world of spirits, which makes thenm refer all the events of their lives to the agency of these spirits. For all the ills of miankind malevolent spirits are directly responsible, though, on the other hand, they do not usually consider good fortune to be the gift of the gods, as if the good things of life were man's normal lot. These numerous spirits are quite distinct from the souls of the departed, which latter, however, now roani</page><page sequence="2">A. E. LAWRENCE AND JOHN HEWITT.-Some Aspects of Spirit Worship. 389 harmlessly in the neighbourhood of their former homes. In accordance with his religious theory, the Milano's methods of retrieving his fallen fortunes or of healing the sick is directed towards the appeasing of the offending spirit. In treating the sickness, therefore, there is no need whatever to administer medicines, the treatment simply being the pacification of the spirit by offerings and by iinjunctions offered through the inedium of pith images, shortly to be described. It will be seen, in fact, that their method of healing is but a form of the world- wide faith cure and that to the great healer, Dame Nature, the Milano patient owes his recovery after the ministrations of the witch doctor. We ought to mention, however, that simple plant remedies are used to some extent by those people who have come under the influence of Islam, and the use of these is gradually spreading. The whole system of communication between men and spirits (not including the souls of the dead) for the purpose of recovery from sickness, prayer for long life, riches, children, or other good things, or for bringing misfortunes upon an enemy, is known as " Bayoh ": the person who acts as medicine man or witch doctor is the " orang bayoh." The Bayoh McAn. He is supposed to be constantly in friendly intercourse with the spirits, and not unusually abuses his privilege by threatening to bring about illness or death unless some unfortunate layman hands over money or coveted goods. The Bayoh man-sometimes women hold this office -does not neglect to impose on the credulity of his people by methods not strictly spiritual. Frequently he is a conjurer, and, whilst addressing some spirit for money or tobacco, will suddenily produce it from his person, or from some unexpected place in the roomn. Conmnunication with the Spirits. As just mentioned, communication between men and spirits is effected by means of images cut in sago pith, known to Mukah Milano as " Dakans," and to the Oya people as " Belum ": these images are supposed to be mnaterial likenesses of the spirits they represent. When a person falls sick, the mode of procedure is as follows: a medicine man (orang bayoh) is called in to diagnose, and he decides which spirit (antu) must be considered to be responsible. Then he returnis home, procures a log of sago palm, and the next day appears at the patient's house with a dakan representing the antu. Then, sitting down by the patient, he begins to beat a drum, not loudly, but in a peculiar way that cannot be mistaken, reciting a monotonous chant in a semi-obsolete language the while: thus calling on the spirit to enter his image and beseeching him to stop the sickness, he now spits on with sireh, which marks the end of his incantation, and then he pours water over the dakan, letting it trickle from the image over the affected part of the patient. During this time, the patient himself does nothing whatever, but just awaits the result of the witch doctor's efforts to cast out devils. After this, the</page><page sequence="3">390 A. E. LAWRENCE AND JOHN HEWITT.-SOMTe Aspects of image is taken to the jungle or hung up on a tree in the air, or placed in the river according as the spirit's real home is jungle, air, or water. Such a ceremony is known as "Bayoh Sukat." In case the patient does not improve in health, another Bayoh man may be called in, who goes tlhrough quite the same ceremoony, using a different spirit, which, however, would probably be allied to the former one. But if the patient becomies seriously ill, a more important ceremony, known as the Berayun, is resorted to. Sometimes this Bayoh ceremony is used when aniy thing special is being asked of the spirits, as for instance a child by a womanl. The "Bayoh Sukat" is carried on in private, but the Berayun (Payun as the Milano call it) is as public as it can possibly be made. The Berayun Ceremony. The Berayun is the most important of all Bayoh ceremonies, and it is only performed in extreme cases: such persons as are really seriously ill or those ardently desiring some great benefit would alone turni to this, their last hope. In the Berayun ceremony the spirits approached are few, in fact only the most powerful of the nulmerous deities of our list. We have never yet come across a Berayun ceremony held for the purpose of obtaining a benefit, but have been assured by Bayoh people that they sometimes do occur, although very rarely. For a description of the Berayun ceremony we are quoting Mr. W. M. Crocker (Sarawak Gazette, Nos. 120 and 121). " Should the sickness still continue, then the last means is resorted to-that is the 'Brayune.' A sorcerer is again called in; he or she is supposed to have power of invoking the good spirit against the bad, and of, in fact, exorcising all kinds of sickness. Should they fail, there is no help for the patient. This sometimes lasts for seven or eight days, during which time their neighbours' sons and daughters all meet, dressed in their fine clothes, and feasting goes on as well as a great deal of flirtatioii. I visited one of these ceremonies some time ago, out of curiosity. On entering the house, I fouind crowds of people assembled, a seat of honour being placed for me in the middle of the room near the centre of operations. This same seat was an absurd representation of a Chinese dragon with a seat on his back, having also horns, and scales painted all the colours of the rainbow; he was represented as standing on the back of a skate, the whole being a masterpiece of carving. It was afterwards given to me." (This is nothing more nor less than a large carving of the dakan, " Naga Terbang Bau Pari," described further on.) "1 The room itself was decorated with parti-coloured cloths, a swing composed of rattans hung across the room to which were attached several small bells, and flowers of the beautiful areca palm. In the background a large band of players on drums and tomtoms kept up the life of the entertainment. The wizard got upon the swing, which he commenced vibrating slowly, keeping time to the music. Presently he comimenced swaying his body in every possible posture, increasing the time and tinkling the bells. Around his person floated two loose silk scarfs, his head being decorated with a gold crown and a, gaudy red silk handkerchief.</page><page sequence="4">Spirit Worship amongst the Milano of Saratwak. 391 The music increased in noise and time until he fell from the swing, apparently inseinsible, but still struggling with the evil spirit over which he was trying to gain the mastery. "A woman afterwards got up. She commenced singing in a low, monotonous half wail, very wild, weird, and musical. She was entreating the evil spirits to be merciful. She then commenced an imitation of paddling, and was supposed to travel into the next world and converse with the spirits. By and by her appeals becarne more violent: she got on the swing and worked herself into such a frenzy that she had to be removed by force. Meanwhile, the sick person was lying in a corner of the room, being disturbed continually by the operators, who waved the flower of the areca palm over him in a wild and witch-like miianner." At a Berayun which one of us had the opportunity of attending, an old lady was being treated for severe dysentery. The dakan employed was Belalangan sian pepugong, which is supposed to be very powerful. It was enclosed in an elaborately carved model house 4 or 5 feet square. The room was decorated with coloured cloths, the flowers of the areca palm and leaves split and plaited into fantastic shapes, mostly representations of birds. The swing was, as is always the case, a single long rattan of the kind called sega (Calamus optimus), from the end of which a ladder made of plaited leaves has to be brought down into connection with the receptacle (model house or boat) of the dakan. This rattan serves as a sort of bridge, by means of which the spirit, after being called from his dwelling place, approaches the dakan. One Bayoh, a man in this case, was conducting the ceremony, but he was not the only person who got upon the swing. It is the usual custom that anyone who knows how, and feels so disposed, can mount the swing and go through the perforinance. Before the swinging commenced, the chief Bayoh man took yellow-dyed rice, and scattered it three times towards each of the four walls of the room (i.e., three times towards each end of the rattan swing, and three times each way across it), chanting an incantation the while and waving an areca flower. Whenever, during the evening, the swing did not happen to be occupied, an areca flower was at once hung across the middle of it. The procedure of those who mounted the swing was much the same as in the preceding account, except that every one of them, besides swaying the body, at the same time recited almost in a monotone an incantation in the old language, addressed to the spirit, begging him to come down and take the sickness out of the patient's body. After recovering from the stupor or frenzy, each performer would go over and see the patient, muttering incantations over her, sprinkling yellow rice and waving an areca flower. The finish of the whole thing was that on the last night the patient herself was supported and swung on the rattan, and finally, after the conductor of ceremonies had also had a swing and recovered from his resulting trance, the desired spirit was pronounced to be present in the dakan receptacle, having comne</page><page sequence="5">392 A. E. LAWRENCE AND JOHN HEW1TT.-Sorme Aspects of along the rattan and down the ladder of leaves; then both patient and doctor got inside it. While there, the Bayoh man spat sireh on to the image (dakan) and poured water over it, sprinkling the drops over his patient's body and muttering his incantations to the spirit meanwhile. No swinging took place after that. Early next morning the dakan in its receptacle was taken from the patient's house with full musical honours, and tied up in a side streamil not far away, where it was left to rot. With the dakan were placed several areca flowers, padi prepared in a certain way, and yellow rice. As the dakan leaves the house, so does the troubling spirit leave his victim's body in peace. Sickcness Boats and Houses. In the Berayun ceremony it is customary to provide the dakans used with special receptacles, often in the formii of a house, but in the case of Iang spirits it is a model boat of sago pith manned with a pith crew and armed with cannon made of the same material. The boat is decorated with flags; inside is a leaf tray containing food. The whole, with the contained dakan, is floated down the river. If the spirit be a Gun spirit, the dakan in its house is consigned to the jungle. In case of epidemic sickness, sometimes a whole village will club together to make a very large and elaborate sickness boat. Such a one was made at Oya a few years ago; it must have been at least 25 feet long, and as it was towed slowly down to sea along with its crew of images, the whole population of the village escorted it along with full musical honours. Familiar Spirits. Each Bayoh man nas a familiar spirit, whom he invokes in all his incantations and by whom he effects communication with the spirits represented by the various dakans. As a rule the different Bayoh men have different familiar spirits, who vary in importance and potency, and, accordingly, Bayoh men vary in power. *For minor cases a Bayoh man whose familiar spirit is not particularly powerful will suffice, but for a serious case the most powerful spirit is considered necessary, and the owner of this spirit used to demand a correspondingly high fee; indeed, before the time of the English Rajahs in Sarawak, the Bayoh men extorted very excessive fees in brass guns, gold, etc., from their patients.' Enchanted Dakans. Prior to the incantation ceremony the dakan is not an object of fear to the natives, but after the incantation so much are they feared that an ordinary Milano would never afterwards even touch them, fearing, in fact, that the sickness for which the dakan was made would be inflicted on the individual who interfered with it; 1 Cf. Ling Roth, Natives of Sarawak, vol. i, p. 285, note 27.</page><page sequence="6">Spirit Worship amongst the Milano of Sarawak. 393 they apparently imagine that the spirit which brought about the sickness now resides in the dakan. The Bayoh people, on the other hand, have no such scruple, and handle the images with impunity. The Spirits and Mortality. This world of spirits by which the Milano are surrouinded appears to dispenise its favours or ills quite irrespective of the morality of the unfortunate object of their attentions. The spirits are always amusinig themselves by annoying some mortal, and his ill luck is not attributed to any " sin " of which he may be suspected, nor indeed do the Milano consider that "wicked " actions are ever punished in this world or the lnext. All the dakan spirits are malevolent, but one or two can also confer benefits. For example, a woman wanting a child, or a man desiring wealth, might undergo a Berayun ceremony, asking their desires of a benevolent spirit. But it is noteworthy that the spirit in conferring favours on a particular person does it at the expense of some other person; if riches are granted, it means that some other person at the same time becomes poor. The most powerful spirit of all, especially for good, is To iang. The Three Classes of Spirits. The spirits which thus trouble mankind are numerous, at the present day being eighty or more; they fall into three classes, accordinig to the places of abode of these spirits, viz., the water spirits of the Iang class, the air spirits of the Langit class, and the jungle spirits of the Gtun class. It is impossible to state in some cases by what methods of reasoning the particular antu hereafter described were associated with a particular disease, but in many cases a fairly reasonable connection is apparent. For instance, the Iang spirits of the water are always held responsible for dysentery, and that is just what might be expected from the fact that when out fishing the Milano invariably eat raw fish and other uncooked food. Cramp, too, is often attributed to a sea spirit. The Langit spirits again are the cause of headache, sunstroke and fever, such as one may easily acquire by exposure to a tropical sun. The Gun spirits are held responsible for swellings of the lower limbs and for ague, diseases often attendant on life in the swamp jungle. A very usuial line of argument, well exemplified in dakans Data gun and Pulum, is as follows: One main hits another in the eye and the sufferer is thus blinded; if, therefore, a person " spontaneously " becomes blind, it follows that a spirit has hit him in the eye. As may be seen, then, by careful examination of our dakan list, in the majority of cases where the real facts concerning the image and its use are clear, there is a sound logical.connection between the sickness and dakan used; in our opinion the study of this phase of their spirit worship is a most interesting chapter in the deductive science of a primitive people.</page><page sequence="7">394 A. E. LAWRENCE AND JOHN HEWITT.-SoMe Aspects of In the following accoulnt of dakans we condense the facts relating to the ceremoony, as it is almost invariably the same as already described. Dakans vary much in size: an average dakan from Mukalh has a length of 8 or 9 inches, but some are smaller and others much bigger. The same kind of dakan varies in its proportions according to the maker. Particular Acco'ant of Dakans. lang Class. Nacga Sebalun.-A wingless, four-footed dragonl, with the tail coming over his back. Used for bilious attacks or poisoning. After the incantation ceremonoy it is deposited on the river banik. Naga Sitnga.-A dragon's head on the legs and feet of a man. Singa in Malay means " a lioln," but they have no acquaintance whatever with this animal. Used for heartburn. This is a river spirit, but the dakan is not taken out of the house. Naga Permaclei. (Known at Oya as N. penganan.)-A dragon's head on the body of a snake. They believe that when a certain poisonous water snake becomes old it turns into this spirit, and now disappears from human gaze to live only at the bottonm of the river. This dakan is used for a heart affection. Their mode of reasoning appears to be that just as when a poisonous snake bites a person the result is a heart failure, so probably a heart disease to which no material cause can be assigned is due to the action of a snake spirit. This dakan after use is attached by a string to a pole standing on the river bank, the dakan itself restinig on tlhe water. Naga Tliimun.-A dragon's head on a body like a cucumber. This dragon is the spirit which, flopping about in the rivers, causes a turmoil in the water, thus undermining the banks and brlinging down the trees growing thereon. This spirit is harmful to mankind in causing the infantile sickness which we associate with ain ,~~~~Q NAGA TIMUN. overloaded stomach. They evidently connect the internal motions of the stomach with the violent comiiotion of water. After the incantation, this dakan is put on the river and allowed to drift: if it were tied up near the house, as in the previous case, the bank would collapse. Naga Berkalih.-Two dragons, each with a snake's body, the tail of the one joined to the head of the other. This spirit has his dwelling place in all whirlpools, both in rivers and seas. He causes people to retch violently without being able to vomit. After the ceremony, this dakan is floated away in the water. The next dakan is scarcely distinguishable from this. iVaga iang angan.-Two dragons, each with a snake's body terminating in a</page><page sequence="8">Spriit Worship amongst the Milano of Sarawvak. 395 pair of legs. This spirit lives in the foam of rivers and is specially in evidence during floods. It causes bad stomach ache with internal noises "as if from a living creature within." After using, the dakan is floated away in a patch of foam. Naga Bertampa.-This is a Naga permalei holding captive under its head a belalangan iang (q.v.). The latter is the familiar spirit of the Naga. The Bayoh man's incantation is directed towards the reinoval of the bela- langan iang. It is used for dysentery. After the in- cantation it is tied up to a pole in the river. Belalangan Ictng.-A person with arms over his chest, the body legless, but ending in a swimming tail. This spirit swims about in the water. He causes dysentery. After use it is tied up to a pole in the river. We have another dakaln of this name very like the one just described, but differing in that this second dakan is T NAGA BERTAMPA. eating his tail. This river spirit causes dysentery: the bleeding of the bitten tail they associate with the loss of blood caused by the disease. Belalayang Iang.-A person with a long bent swimming tail, bifid at the end. This spirit is the cause of lulnacy. The image is tied up in the river near the house ladder. Belalangan Sian Pptngong.-This dakan is a composite structure, in shape like a circular tower, the walls of which are made up of water spirits separated from each other by upright columils, representing the walls of their dwellings. The spirits here are supposed to be workinig together. The names of the individual spirits are:-naga iang, belalangan liso, belalayacq iang, sGpIran,gin iang, gelap iang, dalong iang, jakau iang, gin iankq, belalanqan sian iang. Around the top and bottom of the dakan are twisted the figures of snakes, and these snakes are the guardians of the spirits' dwelling place. This dakan is often used for dysentery. After the ceremony it is tied up in the river near to the patient's house. Bnt-An-Iang.-We have no less than three dakans of this name: (a) Sea-spirit.-A person with one hand up to his ear and the other on his back. This spirit causes fever, with sharp pains in the chest and deafness-note the position of the hands. It is floated out to sea. (b) Sea-spirit.-A person wearing a sun hat, his neck enicircled by a spiky collar. The spirit is the cause of relaxed throats. The dakan is tied up in the water at the mouth of a river. (c) River-spirit.-A person with curious turreted head and with one hand on the chest and one on the abdomen. This is the cause of a tinglingo, sensation all over the surface of the body. The image is consigned to the river, its feet being weighted so that it floats upright.</page><page sequence="9">396 A. E. LAWRENCE AND JOHN ITEWITT.-Some Aspects of UPE 7 1 BU-AU-PENGAMAU-IANG. Bu-Au-Pengamau-Iang.-A person with arms wide spread out and with a very long tongue hanging down on the chest. The spirit lives in shallow waters near the banks. It attacks children, giving them fits, when they assume more or less the appearance of the dakan. Finally it is placed close to the edge of the river in shallow water, its legs buried in the mud. Bm-Au-B6rdindinqg.-A person with shades above and at the two sides of his face, the arms folded up over the abdomen. This water spirit causes unusual labour to a woman in confinement. The dakan is tied up in the river below the place where the family tread out their raw sago. iTo Iang.-This is a composite spirit and as such is the most powerful of all the water spirits: it can give orders to the other spirits. The dakan in shape is a circular tower, the various spirits being arranged in an upright position all rounid. Between adjacent spirits are living posts, which also have lnames. At the top, bottom and middle of the tower it is encircled by snakes. The names of the individual spirits are:-Gelap iang, Dalong iang, Jakau iang, LMliso iang, S'layong iang, Gin iang, Pulumn iang, Semara iang, BuAu-Leliso bulu, Bela-langan sian iang, SNbah iang, Tujah iangq. The names of the posts between these spirits are: Siat, Babang, Benenawa, KMenatio, Bd1ipan, Tiekc, Tatin, BMebai, Tado, Belebang, Belelayang, Selepanai, andc7 Belulei or BKbuyun. The words just nmentioned-we give the meanings later on-are almost all the names of insects, and it is no uinusual thing for a clever Bayoh man to make use of such insects and by sleight of hand to draw them out of a sick person's body. This spirit causes dropsy. Also, however, it has great power for good, alnd people are wont to intercede with it when in pursuit of wealth or of children. After the incantation ceremony this dakan is tied to a stake fixed in the river GELAP BERANTE1. bank. fTo Dat.-This is a married couple who are never seen separately. They each have turreted heads and the hands are ventrally applied. The wife wears ear ornaments. They cause dysentery. Their home is far out at sea where the barongzs (sea boats) fish. After using, they are taken out to sea and allowed to drift. Galap Iany.-A person with both hands to his ears and with a turreted head. This river spirit causes sharp pains in the liver region. The dakan is deposited amidst the reeds at the side of the river. Ge'lap BMrantei.-A person wearing a sun hat, with chains around his chest and with one hand up to the ear, the other on his chest. This dakan is not used alone, but only in conjunction with Jin Berantei, whose slave he is.</page><page sequence="10">Spi ri t Worship amongst the Milano of Sarsawak. 397 Jin B6rantei.-A person riding on a ray fish; he has a chain round his body, has a hole in his hat to hold a torch, and he holds his beard in both hands. They say this is the spirit of the ikan (fish) Remahan. Fishermen often see this antu at night in the shape of an incandescent light-the torch-on the water. When they have this experience they always riin away. The effect on a person victimised by the spirit is severe pains in the left side, followed by fainting. This dakan is floated off to the sea after use. Jin lang.-A person wearing a sun hat, hands up together on the chest, with a scaly body as usual with Iangs. This sea spirit has exactly the same effect on man as Jin Brantei. This image is floated off to sea. Berantei Iang.-A person with a snake twined round his neck, its head grasped in his two hands below. This river spirit causes a feeling of fulness in the chest and nausea. This image is tied up in the river below the house ladder. Note the connection of thought between the entwining snake and the feeling of fulness in the chest. Dengong Iang.-A person with head turned round to one side, one hand being on his chest, and the other on his stomach. This sea spirit causes the tendons of the legs to retract, making it impossible to walk. Daloonq Ianq.-We have two dakans under this name: BERANTEI IANG. (a) A boat containing two antu and two dogs. When this spirit company meets a person, if the dogs bark the antz will throw spears at the person, and the result of this is that the unfortunate sufferer has sharp pains in the intestines, accompanied by dysentery. In making this particular dakan, our Bayoh man did not make the spears of the antua lest they should be misused. The dakan is floated down the river at evening. DALONG IANG. (b) A man with hands crossed over his chest, wearing a chawat (a loin cloth as now worn by Sea Dayaks and formerly by Milano). It causes dropsy, perhaps that of beri-beri. The dakan is floated down the river at evening. Dohig Iang.-We have two of this also: (a) A man with a head cloth, with both hands on his chest. This spirit causes dropsy. It is floated down the river at night, and as it goes past the houses its influence makes the people sleep. VOL. XXXVIII. 2 D</page><page sequence="11">398 A. E. LAWRENCE AND JOHN HEWITT.-SOree Aspects of (b) A female spirit. She is bareheaded and has one hand on the chest, the other on the abdomen. She causes a painful swelling of the knee joints. It is floated down the river after use. Potianak Laut.-Two people stuck together at the side like Siamese twins. They always work together. This spirit is the cause of hard labour in women during childbirtb. The dakan is eventually floated out to sea. The name Pontianak (Malay), as an evil spirit associated with childbirth, is one of wide distribution, stretching up through the Malay Peninsula into Siam and India. Jakau 1ang Angan.-A person sitting down, with wings like scales all over his back. This river spirit causes dropsy. It is tied to the house ladder and allowed to float on the surface of the river. Tmujah Iang.-A man with a high scaly head-gear, with one hand on his chest and the other on his stomach. This river spirit causes sharp pains in the small of the back (lumbago). It is floated off in the middle of the river. Kerawi Iang.-A four-footed person with curved head-gear and with a tail which curves up and is held up to the throat. This is a river spirit which causes severe coughs. It seems to be their belief that coughs are caused by a spirit pressing on the throat of some unfortunate human being. The dakan is floated in the river tied to the house ladder. &amp;Sbah Iang.-We have two kinds of this name: (a) A person wearing a sun hat, with both hands over his forehead. It causes headaches: note the position of the hands. It is finally deposited on the seashore. (b) A person with one hand on the throat and the other across the abdomen. This river spirit causes shiverilng and a violent con- traction of the throat, so that the sufferer can scarcely speak. The dakan is finally consigned to the river. Gelainat Iang.-Of the two spirits under this name one is male and the other female. They are always used in conjunction. The male has a three-peaked head- dress, is winged on the back, and has his hands crossed over the chest. The female is very scaly all over and is winged behind. She has a conical head-gear, and her hands are together on the abdomen. This spirit couple lives in the rivers and causes dysentery. Spirits of the Air. (Langit Class.) Naga Terbang.-A dragon, whose tail curls up and goes into the back of the head. This dragon spirit makes one hot and bilious. After the ceremony it is stuck out at the end of a long pole, so as to be freely exposed to the air. Naga Terbang Langit.-A winged dragon with two legs and a fan-shaped tail. This is for biliousness and beartburn, Used exactly in the same way as Naga Ter bang.</page><page sequence="12">Spirit Worship amongst the Milano of Sarawak. 399 Naga Ter bang Bau Pari.-A Naga Terbang standing on a ray fish. This makes one hot and feverish, with a feeling of fulness in the chest. The dakan is hung up on a tree near the house.

Jin Separangin.-A person wearing a large head-dress with angel-like wings and with his hands up over his eyes. It causes fever and delirium. This dakan is placed in a specially colnstructed receptacle in a tree near the patient's house. Jin Separangin Langit.-A winged personi wearing a sun hat, one hand to his head and the other on his chest. This spirit causes sharp pains in the back. It is stuck out on a pole near the house.

The boat has at its sides a pair of wings, and it ends in a dragon's head. The contained spirits are Sebulan Langit and Gelap Lctngit, both of which bring about delirious fever. The dakan is put out at the end of a long pole near the house. Gelap Separangin.-A person with one hand across his chest and the other on the head. This spirit causes fever, with a soreness all over the body. It is fastened to a branch of a tree near the house. K6rawi Langit.-A winged, four-footed creature represented hiding the face with its tail. Another specimen of this dakan is a winged person with tail only reaching as far as the chest. He wears a crown of horns. It is used for chronic cough, caused by pressure of the antit's tail on the chest. It is placed in a little receptacle high up in the air, near the house. Siau Langit.-This is a fowl. The fowl spirit causes asthma. They probably see a connection between the noise of fowls and that of asthmatic persons. The dakan is put on the end of a long pole above the house. (Siau, fowl.) Maiau.-A male and feinale hornbill. This spirit of the horubill causes bad coughs in children. The cry of a hornbill remninds one much of a harsh cough! The dakans are each placed on a split stick above the roof of the house. (Maiau, a certain kind of hornbill.) Potianak Buronq.-A winged animal with large curved beak and two pairs of POTIANAK BTYR,-GI POTIANAK BURONG. legs, the anterior pair coming up towards the beak, and protruding outstretched hands as if lapping up a liquid. This spirit drinks the blood of childbirth. He may or may not cause special sickness to the woman. The dakan is hung below the house of a woman in con- finement. There is no sprinkling of water in this case.' Tujah Lcangit.-A winged person with one hand up to the head and the other across the abdomen. He causes fever, great weakness and perspiration. The image is hung in a tree near the house. Babang Langit.-Babang is a large stag-beetle which attacks the coconut palm. The dakan is a crude representation of such a winged animal; his tail ends in a fan and the head has an armament resembling that of the beetle. The spirit of this beetle causes ear-ache. The image is impaled on a sharpened twig of a tree near the house. Bua Dian.-A hollow ellipsoid containing two figures of spirits, Dlciso langit. The surface of the image is much spiked. The spirit's inside are brother and sister. This causes very bad headache when the head feels as if splitting. Perhaps the forcible splitting of the durian fruit when ripe suggested this dakan. It is finally hung up on a growiiig tree near the house.

But-Ant-Pengamau.-There are two kinds of this: (a) A person wearing a sun hat, his hands over his chest. The spirit dwells near the sea in Mahommedan graveyards. He meets people out walking, and causes them to have a fit. The image finds his resting place on the ground of the graveyard. (b) A person sitting down with hands folded up over his chest. This spirit dwells inland in the graves of " heathen " Milano. He causes children to have convulsions. The dakan is placed on the ground in a Milano graveyard. Bu-Au-Th.-We have two kinds of this:- (a) A person with curiously peaked head-dress, with one hand on his forehead, and the other on his chest. The spirit hits children on the head and thus causes convulsions. It is supposed to feed on the roots of the Kalinut tree, at the base of which the dakan is finally deposited. (b) A person wearing a sun hat, his hands meeting over the chest. This spirit causes swelling of the leg. The dakan is deposited at the foot of any large tree. Dohig Balo (Balo, widow).-A widowed lady with a long mourning cloth hanging from her head behind. She holds one hand on the tip of the heart. This spirit causes a numbness and great weakness throughout the body. Presumably the pain of mourning and the subsequent physical exhaustion after the death of a husband is so very general, that it is supposed to be due to this special spirit, which may also cause physical weakness on occasions other than a bereavement. This dakan is placed on the ground in the jungle. Dohig Assam.-A long-haired old man with his left hand to his lumbar region. It is used for lumbago. This spirit frequents the neighbourhood of the Assam paya trees (Zalacca conferta) in the swamps, and he eats the fruits of this palm. Sometimes one meets it in the jungle, and then one should throw a dead stick at it. The dakan is put out into the jungle on the ground. DOHIG BALO. Dohig Darat.-A woman wearing a sun hat, her long hair sticking out behind, When she meets a mortal being, her hair pricks one's skin and the sufferer has a feeling of pins and needles all over, with internal fever. It is eventually deposited in the jungle. Pulum.--A person with a long, peaked head gear, and with a dart stuck in one eye.

The spirit inhabits Moslem graveyards, where the dakan is eventually deposited after the dart has been extracted. Dalong ]7ugan.-A person armed with a parang (sword) and shield, and in the act of throwing a spear. When this spirit throws his spear the result is sharp pains in the chest; if it catches the heart, the sufferer will succumb. The dakan is put on the ground in the jungle. Bldlangan To.-A person with a blow-pipe and bamboo case containing darts. In the specimen belonginga to the Sarawak Museum, the dakani is without its blow-pipe, as the maker of the image was afraid that the weapon would have been misused. This person is ornamented with a bead necklet and a pair of armlets such as the less civilized of Sarawak natives now wear. This spirit, by blowiilg his darts, causes sharp painis in the thorax, or in anly other iegion of the body at which he may choose to aim. The dakan is often used after Dalong Tfugan has been tried without success. It is eventually placed in the jungle. PULUM. BELALANGAN TO. SEBAR GUN (A). DATA GUN. DATA TANAH. S&amp;bcth Gtn (GCan, jungle).-There are two dakans of this name: (a) A person wearing a sun hat, his hands over his chest. He causes sharp pains in the chest and giddiness. The dakan is placed at the foot of any jungle tree. (b) A person with one hanid on the abdomen and the other to his head. This spirit causes sharp painis in the abdolmien. The image is buried up to the waist in the middle of a path in the jungle. Data Gun.-A person with an elongated spiky head-dress. This jungle spirit lives in the ground, and wheni he hears anyone coming, raises his spiky head out of the groulnd so that the man treads on it. Such is the explanation of a curious swelling of the feet followed by sores, attendant oni a life in the jungle. The image is buried in the jungle. Data Tanah.-This is a person whose body ends in a broad, sharpened tail.</page><page sequence="16">Spirit Worshtp amongst the Jiitano of Scarawvk. 403 He causes exactly the same sort of swelling as Data Cnn. The dakan is set down on the ground in the jungle. GC1ap Gun.-A person wearing a sun hat, his hand up to his throat. He causes coughs. The image is placed at the foot of a large tree. Jakau Gun.-A person with a bifid head-dress, his hailds crossed over the chest. This spirit causes ophthalmnia. The image is put at the foot of a small tree in the jungle. Bduum Gun.-A small person wearing a sun hat, his hands together over the stomiach. This spirit causes the feet to swell anid itch. The image is buried in the jungle. Bubun Banei Bejerunei.-This spirit lives far away in the deepest recesses of the jungle and is Rajah of all the jungle spirits, whence he I-% Ii )l I" v %M%I GELAP GUN. issues his orders to the other jungle spirits. He has some power for good and can grant long life, riches and children, though he is not so powerful as To iang. He causes very low fever. The image finds its resting place at the foot of a fig tree in the jungle. Dalong Pelekong.-A man armed with sumrpitan held up to his head, and with parang by his side; beside him trots his dog. This jungle spirit is made like a Kayan, seeing-that the warlike Kayan, four or five generations ago, were wont to swoop down from- the interior upon the villages of the unsuspecting Milano. This spirit is supposed to come down from far up river, floating in a doyan or dyeing trough. With his sumpitan (blow-pipe) this spirit blows darts at unsuspecting mortals, causing sharp pains in the regions of the lower ribs. The image is put in the jungle either at the foot of a large tree, or at the source of a jungle stream in the water. Obsolete Words and their Meanings. The words used as names for these dakans are mostly of unknown meaning. Some few are known elsewhere, e.g., Potianak (see note on Potianak laut); buanb, which is well known to Land Dayaks as the ghost of a person killed in war; iang, also a Land Dayak deity, their divine instructor, the word yang being an old word used of the greater Hindu deities; and jins, the genii of the "Arabian Nights pulumt may, perhaps, be the same as the polong of pagan Malays.' At Matu and Oya the Milano name for the pith images is bMlum; at Mukah belumrt means an enemy in the jungle. In our description of the dakan Co lang we mention the names of the living pillars separating the spirits; these names, belonging as they do to the obsolete " spirit " language, are almost all unknown to the average Milano. Such are bUlUbang, meaning a butterfly; tatin, the carpenter- bee; bUlebai, the smiall phosphorescent centipede; kle'natio, the biting field-cricket; belulei, a night-flying beetle; sdlepunai, a small hairy caterpillar; be'nnaea, a large grasshopper; and bUllayang, the long-beaked fish known to Malays as i/can julong I Skeat's faltay Magic, p. 328.</page><page sequence="17">404 A. E. LAWRENGCE AND JOHN HEWITT.-Some Aspects of (Hemirhamvphus). The other living pillars of the same dakan have names of modern use, viz., babang, the coconut-beetle (a large Dynastid); siat, a large white beetle larva (of Oryetes r,hinoceros); tiek, a jumping beetle (an Elater); and tado, a caterpillar with poisonous hairs. In the case of the dakali namies to which we can assign no meaning, it may well be that many of them are old Milano words of some such simple significance as those just mentioned, though some may be the names of the reverenced deities of other peoples with whom they have come in contact (e.g., their Jin). At the end of this paper we give some verses of the obsolete language as used by the medicine doctors in the incantation of a Bayoh ceremony. In all probability this " language of the spirits " is but the language of the common people as spoken by them a few generationis ago; in recent times Malay has come into general use, especially where the Milano have adopted Islamism. Even the lnames of the dakans have now, in many cases, a Malay rendering in common use. For instance:- Pontianak7 laut is the Malay formn and Potianak dat is Milano. Naga tercbang ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, Naga besilieng Dohig darat ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, Dohg daya In these and several other cases the first form is ordinarily employed by Milano. Burial Customs. Coffins of Milano are made to represent either a crocodile or a dragon, the cavity being cut in the body of the figure and closed by a lid above. Within the coffin is placed the corpse, specially draped for burial, and on the lid is an anthropomorphic image of plaited nitpah leaf, which is covered over with a red cloth, red being their mourning colour. A similar leaf image is taken home and kept by the nearest relative. The coffin is deposited in the family dead-house or bakut, where it rests on two trestles of bilian wood. From a hole in the bottom of the coffin a bamboo tube leads downwards into the ground and serves to carry away putrefied matter; the lid is sealed down. When nothing remains but the dried skeleton, it was, in former times, customary to remove these bones to a mortuary called a jerunei. This is a cylindrical wooden structure, vertically arranged, reaching above ground to a height of about 18 feet, and having a width of about a yard. Below, it rests in a deep hole, and in placing the jerunei in its position it was customary to have a slave at the bottom of the hole; the huge structure was, during the ceremony, dropped on the person of the helpless slave. Soinetimes another slave would be bound to the top of the jerunei, where he would starve to death. At the top of the mortuary a large jar is supported between four prongs sticking upwards from four corners of the jerunei, and this jar receives the newly- arrived remains. Lower down the structure a large aperture in the side leads into the cavity of the mortuary; into this cavity the skeletons of the jar are placed when there is iio further room for recent arrivals. The woodwork is elaborately</page><page sequence="18">Spirit WVorship amoongst the iltano qf Sarawak. 405 carved with phyllomorphic designs. Only very few of these jerunei are now in existence, and it is almost certain that no more will be made. Some fine specimens of this odd-looking grave are still to be seen amolngst the Long Kiput of the Baram River. The bakcut mentioned previously is a one-roomed house built according to no stereotyped designs, and there is much variety of taste shown in those of a graveyard. They appear to vie with each other in producing a building of greater beauty and endurance, so much so that it is often said of them that the houses of the dead are usually better than those of the living. Often the wood is of bilian, the toughest and most enduring of Bornean woods, and this is elaborately carved at the sides and on the ridge of the roof, the side designs being apparently phyllomorphs and those of the ridge being largely made up of dragons in various attitudes. The size and filnish of the bakcut varies according to the wealth of the family who built it. From the roof and sides of the house project a number of flags and opened umbrellas, which give an air of gaiety to a place of otherwise sombre features. The graveyards may contain a great number of such ba/cuts. Coffins are temporarily buried, but this only occurs soinetimes when there is no ba/cut (family dead-house), and burial should not take place until the sabong (cock-fighting) and feast have been held. In such case the coffin is buried from one to ten days after death, according to means: it is the custom that as long as there is an unburied corpse in the house, food and drink must be offered to all who enter, which, of course, entails considerable expense. Having buried the coffin, the relations put up a ba/ut as soon as possible, and when it is finished the coffin is dug up and placed in it. If they already have a family ba/cut, the coffin is put straight into it. Those who can afford it always have a sabong (or cock-fight) for the benefit of the dead man's soul. This may continue several days, and absolutely open house is kept all the time. As much as $800 was spent over this on one occasion lately, but from $200 to $500 is more usual, nowadays. All the cocks killed and things used at this sabong are supposed to become the property of the dead man's spirit. When a man dies, his soul comes out of his body and is met by Jepang. Jepadng conducts the soul to the entrance of Hades, where Balo Adat, chief of the realm of the dead, receives it and allots it a place. After the sabong a journey is made to the burial ground, the coffin opened, and some one knocks loudly on the lid with a piece of wood. Then another person, who is conversant with the ancient language, sits before the opened coffin and, talking in that tongue, asks Balo Adat to allow the dead man's spirit to revisit the resting place of his body, and the soul accordingly makes the journey back from the country of the dead. Then it is told what has been done during the sabong and asked to take possession of the things offered for its, prosperity in the next world. The soul then goes back to the realm of shades, where it henceforward is enabled to enjoy all the property presented to it by its relations on earth. The coffin is then shut and returned to its place or</page><page sequence="19">406 A. S,. LAWRENGC AND JOHN H1WITT.-Sorme Aspects of buried, and this ceremony, the last duty of the living towards the dead, is finished. The Mukah Milano, although now great gamblers-having caught the vice from Chinese and Brunei people-do not bet on the result of these cock-fights. When a cock is killed, it is handed over to the women to be cooked and forms part of the feast. -Distribution of this and Cognate Forms of Spirit Wor-ship. It is somiewhat renmarkable that the dakan custom of Spirit Worship is a very isolated one in Borneo. It is, in fact, confined to the Milano: at the same time it is quite a usual thing for other natives of this island to make inmages to represent spirits, but these are rather of the nature of tutelary deities and remain about the house or village for an indefinite period. And again, in cases of general epidemics or of serious sickness of some inmportant persoin, it is a general custom of other races as well as of Malays to construct small or large spirit boats, known as lanchangs, which are floated down the river.' According to Mr. Boden Kloss, a similar custom is in vogue in the coast villages of Singapore, Johore, and East Sumatra, and in the islands of the Rio Linga Archipelago: here, when a man falls ill, he makes either a human image or a house, or a smiall ship, into which the spirit of sickness enters to the relief of the sufferer: the former two would be taken to the jungle and hung on trees, and the boat would be sent off to the sea. Such is the custom of people who are real Malays. In many parts of the Malay Archipelago images of similar appearances are common, but they are usually more permanent and are not used in the same way as the Milano dakans. A collection of images acquired by Mr. C. Boden Kloss from Nias, West Sumatra, has a fairly general resemblance to our dakans, and in the case of a few individual images the likeness is very striking. We are informed by Mr. Boden Kloss that the Nias images are kept in the houses of the natives as household deities. Something very similar to the Milano custom is to be found also amongst the Toba Batak, living in the interior of Sumatra to the south of the Tobo Lake, where in case of disease they carve images out of the stem of a banana tree. Iln the southern part of Bantam (island off Java) images are made of a kind of vermicelli mnade from rice paste, and these images are deposited in the jungle to please the spirits. As we have previously mentioned, the Milano are quite distinct from Malays, belonging to the group of tribes known as Kalaniantan, which, we opine, is closely related to the wilder tribes of Sumatra and other islands of the Archipelago. But we have seeni that their religious customs are shared to some extent by Malays as well as by the more closely related tribes, and we are inclined to think, therefore, that the spirit worship just described is but a much exaggerated product of a simple religion which in essential principles was common to pre-Islamic Malays and to the above menitioned peoples (Indonesians); and that it is carried to the greatest extreme I See also Skeat's Matay Magic.</page><page sequence="20">Spirit WorsAip amiongst the Milano of Sarawak. 407 by the Milano of Sarawak. We suspect that the images made in these islands have a unity of origin, in spite of the fact that they are used quite differently in the various localities. When the ancestors of these people learned the notion of image making we do not klnow, but it seenms probable that the custom is one of considerable antiquity, and of internal origin, seeing that the Indonesialns of practically all the far-off isles practise some such form of spirit worship. The materials for most of the facts mentioned in our account of dakans was supplied by an aged Bayoh man of Mukah. Many of his statements and- names have been satisfactorily checked by information supplied fronm a perfectly independent source in Kuching. Quite possibly, however, one or two of the lesser dakans are special pet inventions of his own, and we imagine that most Bayoh men occasionally strike out a little way in a new direction. In conclusion we venture to predict the gradual extinction of these interesting customs at no very remote date: Islamism- and Christianity are gradually displacing paganism, and at the same time, by contact with Europeans and civilization, the Milano are perhaps becoming less credulous.

(NOTE.-In the above, final ei represents the sound of ay in the English "day," "tray," etc.) The Bayoh calls on the spirits (the names "Jin " and "Arabi Diwa" seem to be borrowed and incorporated into the old verses, but ffdkut meran bunga, or " noble," a female spirit, does not sound so familiar) as if they were far away up river, to " come in boats floating quickly " (pado paman dena) and take away the sickness, remove the evil, etc., saying that if the spirits wish to do so it is certain that they can. In fact, the whole incantation is a succession of appeals of this sort to the spirits, who come gradually nearer and nearer until the chant addresses them as if they were just outside the house, and finally as though present in the room. NOTE. Even in this old language or tdabau dana there is a good sprinkling of Malay words, often pronounced wrongly because a Milano either cannot or will not give them the proper sound in speaking. i.e., bato, in line 16 is the Malay batu bayo ,, ,, 37 ,, ,, ,, baju atai ,, ,, 19 ,, ,, ,, hati linga,, ,, 34 ,, ,, ,, tlingc. These have been written in the Milano style for the sake of rhyme, as they sometimes end a line in the chant, but a few other words have been written as pronounced by Malays. Thus chelaka, if written as pronounced by Milano, should haye appeared selaka. An ordinary Milano cannot pronounce the sound ch. The word yadin in line 74 has been written as the Milano pronounce it, in order to show how an adopted word is sometimes distorted. It is the Malay jadi.</page><page sequence="22">FIG. 1.-SICKNESS BOAT OR LANCIIANG. FIG. 2.-GROUII OF MILA~NO FIG. 3.-A GRAVEYARD.
