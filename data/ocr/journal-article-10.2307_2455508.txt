<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRESENT PIOBLEMS IN PLANT ECOLOGY' THE TREND OF ECOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR HENRY C. COWLES UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THAT Scl-iimiper was a prophet as well as an ecologist of the first magnitude is well attested by this sentence from the preface to his plant geography: The ecology of plant distribution will succeed in opening out new paths on condition only that it leans closely on experimental physiol- ogy; thus only will it be possible to sever the study of adaptations from the dilettantism which revels in them, and to free it from anthropomorphic trifling, which has threatened to bring it into com- plete discredit. The close interdependence of physiology and ecology is being more and more recognized; this is made! manifest by a survey of the titles presented to the botanical meet- ings year by year. Suggestive among this year's titles are: Bog toxins and their effect upon soils; experi- melntally induced root-regeneration in Parthenium; the relation of evaporation to the treelessness of prairies; are alpine plants exposed to increased evaporation? Titles such as these would have been quite impossible a few years ago through the failure. of ecologists to recognize the fundamental necessity of building their work upon physiological foundations. Quite as fundamental but less fully recognized, especially by many physiologists, is the dependence of physiology upon ecology. The in- crea~sing sanity of physiological problems is due in large measure to the wholesome influence of ecology. In the old days when physiology was a mere laboratory science, and therefore artificial, no experimental test could be too 'A series of papers presented before the Botanical Society of America at the Baltimore meeting, by invitation of the Council. 356</page><page sequence="2">No. 510] PROBLEMS IN PLANT ECOLOGY 357 bizarre to be applied to plants. A thing never to be lost sight of is that evolution has taken place out of doors, and that the contortions of a puny plant in our illy lighted and gas-ridden laboratories do not solve our most im- portant problems. In recent years no physiological work of greater import has appeared than that from the Desert Laboratory, where the direct stimulus to research has been contributed by the desert itself and its ecological problems. The developments of the past decade, therefore, make it essential that physiology and ecology break down the barrier erected for them in Madison in 1893, where it. was declared that physiology is experimental and ecology ob- servational. The ecologist must experiment in order to resolve a natural complex of factors into its individual elements, while the physiologist must be a student of field conditions, if he wishes to deal sanely with the great problems connected with the evolution of form and behavior. Recognizing, then, the interdependence if not the complete identity of experimental ecology and field physiology, it becomes necessary to consider the underlying philosophy that serves as a motive for all research along these lines. The importance of one 's philosophy upon his research can scarcely be overesti- mated, for it determines the problems to be attacked, the methods to be employed, and, on account of the per- sonal equation, is likely to give some color to the results secured. But it is not necessary that the working theory be true; indeed it is often better that it be most untrue, since it may thus lead to the testing of more theories than might otherwise be employed. The fundamental test of a working theory is that it be that one which will stimu- late the maximum of discriminative research. There can be given no better illustration of an unproductive theory than the theory of vitalism. This supposes that there is a fundamental difference between the living and the non- living, :hence one would not expect a vitalist to lead in the attempt to create living matter by experiment.</page><page sequence="3">358 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. XLIII Vitalism, whether true or not, conduces to lethargy, be- cause it assumes a barrier instead of attempting to find if the supposed barrier can be broken down. Thus the mechanistic theory of life is best as a, working hypothesis because it leads to decisive experimentation and to the attempt to create living matter, and in this way leads to the solution of many great problems and may some day cause the settlement of that greatest of all problems, the origin of life. On the other hand, vitalism, by assuming to answer the question in a. way that transcends the possi- bility of experimental test, is a hopeless theory and leads to repose and scientific. slumber rather than to activity. While theories of vitalism in whatever form have ever blighted scientific endeavor, they have been especially harmful in ecology. No biologists are brought into closer touch with life than are the ecologists; their whole atmos- phere is pregnant with dynamics and the aspect which they have of plants is that of extreme plasticity. The ecologist comes into daily contact with profound changes in plant form and behavior, and he sees ever before him the panorama of succession. What wonder is it that many ecologists have been carried off their feet by vitalism and have dabbled in anthropomorphic similes? And what wonder that, because of this attitude, some of our best biologists have seen naught in ecology but superficial vaporings or scientific, nonsense"? But the view-point of ecology.t has been shifting, indeed has largely shifted, and there are reasons for believing that the ecologists are now closer to the problems of to-morrow than many of the other biologists. The rescue of ecology from dilettant- ism and anthropomorphic trifling, which Schimper so keenly wished for a decade ago, has been essentially real- ized. It may be of value to outline the steps that have led to the present happy state. From the beginning one of the greatest of ecological problems has been that of the origin and significance of adaptations. In other days the solution was sought in special, creation, one of the most unscientific' of all</page><page sequence="4">No. 510] PROBLEMS IN PLANT ECOLOGY 359 theories, because altogether subversive of experiment. The entire question was prejudged at the outset. The theory of special creation, however, has not been espe- cially harmful, because it has generally seemed so un- likely as to have received but little support among scien- tific men. Perhaps the most baneful of all ecological theories has been the Lamarckian theory of direct adapta- tion. In its day, that is before 1859, it marked a distinct advance, because it was the first significant attempt to displace specia-l creation by something better. The great merit of Lamarekism was the recognition of plas- ticity, the substitution of a dynamic for a static nature. Ha.d it been generally accepted, it might easily be said to have marked the greatest single step in the advance of scientific thought, but the world was not then ready for dynamic conceptions. The leaven of Laplacian as- tronomny had scarce begun to work, and the Lyellian geology was as yet unborn. The evil wrought by Lamnarckism is due to its accept- ance by modern biologists. It is essentially a vitalistic theory, presupposing that plants and animals have some inherent, mysterious power to contravene the ordinary laws of matter. They are supposed to be able to sur- vive hard conditions because able to adapt themselves advantageously. Of course it is clear that those plants which do respond favorably to changing conditions will be most likely to survive, but a-daptationists have appar- ently overlooked the fact that thousands of species must have died because unprovided with a.n adequate capacity for advantageous response. Their conception of nature is distorted by centering their attention upon those suc- cessful plants that appear to have survived because of their adaptations. The depressing effect of the adapta- tion hypothesis is most obvious in that it has encouraged sterile imaginings as to the advantages of this, that or the other plant structure and has thus discouraged attempts to discover the real facts involved in the origin of such structures.</page><page sequence="5">360 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. XLIII Evidence against the reality of adaptation in a sub- jective sense has been accumulating. At first sight the increase of cutin in plants exposed to increasingly xero- phytic conditions, or the increased development of air chambers in plants exposed to increasingly hydrophytic conditions look like adaptations, and such changes cer- tainly seem advantageous. However, there are facts that point in another direction. There is no more important source of strength in plants than that afforded by bast and similar mnechanica.l tissues. Yet recent experi- menters have failed to get any significant response in the way of great bast development by exposing growing organs to considerable tension. Bast primordia, how- ever, are very plastic and respond readily to changes in moisture. Thus we have in bundles of bast fibers tissues that do not adapt themselves to a demand for tensile strength, although such a response would be highly ad- vantageous; on the other hand, they respond to increased transpiration, although it has not been claimed that bast fibers are of especial value in checking transpiration. Again, increased conduction, whether due to high tran- spiration or other causes, often results in an increased development of the vascular tract. The advantage of such a modification is at least dubious in xerophytes, but the case is much more striking in such plants as Arte- misia, when parasitized by Orobanche. The Artemisia root is stimulated to excessive development by the attack of the parasite, and examination shows that the vascular tract in particular is greatly increased. If this change in the Arteinisia root is an adaptation, it is an adaptation for the Orobanche and not for itself, and what adapta- tionist could expect a plant to be so altruistic as all this? Similar phenomena are seen in fungus and insect galls, and in the cynipid galls in particular, food accumulates in large amount in definite lavers around the larval charn- ber. Can the oak be supposed to be so thoughtful for the insect as to provide it food? Or, if one chooses the other Horn of the dilemma, can the insect be supposed to have</page><page sequence="6">No. 510] PROBLEMS IN PLANT ECOLOGY 861 learned the ha-bits of the oak, and found just how to tap it? How much more sane it is to regard these and all other plant reactions as brought about through the in- fluence of specific stimuli, treating any advantage that may come (or any disadvantage) as quite incidental to 'the main problem! At the present day Lamiarckisn and adaptation are scarcely as detrimental to ecological thinking as is the misapplication of Natural Selection. The publication. of the "Origin of Species" in 1859 influenced. biological thought more profoundly than any other work of all his- tory. It compelled the world to accept the doctrine of organic evolution, and it showed most clearly why certain species die and others live. But it shed only a little light on the great questions involved in the evolution of new species. In view of this it seems most unfortunate that the book was entitled "The Origin of Species"; the alternative title commonly printed just beneath in smaller type presents the, real thesis of the book: "The Preserva.- tion of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life." Per- laps in part because of the title, but more because of Darwin's over-zealous supporters, natural selection has been made a fetish and has been supposed to account for new forms and structures, as well as for their preserva- tion. In other words, it has been erroneously regarded by many as a theory of evolution instead of a means of accounting for the perpetuation or destruction of species previously formed. The theory of natural selection has worked great harm in the ecological study of plant struc- tures. Thorny plants have been supposed to be selected by reason of animal incursion, and such complex things as floral structures have been supposed to be the result of parallel selection on the part of flowers and insects. There is no adequate evidence, experimental or otherwise, for views of this character. Such experimental work as has been done appears to slhowT that the success or failure of a plant rarely depends upon this or that little advan- tage, upon which natural selection may be supposed to</page><page sequence="7">362 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. XLIII work, but rather that its perpetuation depends for the most part upon other things than its so-called adaptations. Few more perfect adaptations for their function can be thought of than the digestive glands of insectivorous plants, and yet there is no evidence in support of the idea that such plants have been able to survive by reason of these glands. The evolution of such a complex flower as that of the orchid along lines that are parallel with the evolution of the mouth parts of a special insect requires a nicety of operation that seems staggering, and' all the more because the flower, at least, seems to have evolved so far along the lines of zygomorphy a.s to be a. source of disadvantage rather than of advantage, an impossible idea to the natural selectionist. The facts of regenera.- tion show, as pointed out so ably by Morga-n, that plants and animals are often in a position to make an instant new reaction to conditions unlike those to which they have ever been accustomed, and that these reactions may or may not be advantageous; in any case, natural selection can have no possible connection with their origin. The trend of the time, especially among botanists, is unmis- takably toward the abandonment of natural selection as a theory of evolution, but ecological work is finding a dominant place for it a-s one of the controlling factors in succession. The student of vegetation dynamics, more, perhaps, than any other, finds displayed before. him an incessant struggle for existence; in the changing condi- tions, the fitness of an old species to remain or of a new species to displace, it is commonly a matter of profound importance in the vegetative change produced. This is not the place to enter upon a discussion of those evolutionary theories that to-day hold the foremost place. We are awaiting with keen anticipation the noteworthy symposium on evolution that is to make this meeting historic. Suffice it to say that the downfall of the theory of adaptation does not mean the downfall of epigenesis or of extrinsic theories in general. The likelihood of a profound influence of the external world upon the trend</page><page sequence="8">No. 510] PROBLEMS IN PLANT ECOLOGY 363 of evolution was never more evident in the past than it is to-day. The work of Kilebs has opened up almost limit- less possibilities along such lines. The intrinsic theories of evolution, such as orthogenesis and heterogenesis (or mutation) are also vigorously maintained. All such theories, both extrinsic and intrinsic, appear to be in harmony with the present results of ecological research, and the future alone may say whether some or all of these and more are true. To the working ecologist the necessary consequences of the abandonment of the idea of adaptation and of nat- ural selection as a causative factor are most vital. First and foremost there comes the possibility of disad- vantageous trends in evolution. To some extent such tendencies wTill be checked by the destructive operation of natural selection, so that only such new species as are most fit are likely to survive and have progeny. Bnt in view of the ideas that have generally prevailed in past years, it can not be emphasizeA too strongly that plants may retain useless structures and even structures that are moderately harmful, and yet live on if they also possess other structures or habits that are sufficiently ad- vantageous. This conception at once relieves ecologists of one of the most arduous of their former duties, the establishment of an advantageous function for every or- gan, and of a benefit in every function. TIme chapters omi the uses of palisade cells, crystals, poisomis, latex and the myriad kinds of hairs are likely to be shorter and less dogmatic in future ecological treatises. Even such or- gans as stomata are apparently being divested of their erstwhile most important function, the regulation of transpiration. It has been so long the fashion to regard the various kinds of floral structures as most useful that it may be thought ecological heresy to question their utility. The intimate correlation between the evolution of the insect and the flower was such a pretty story that it seems rude to question it, but, do we have any adequate evidence of</page><page sequence="9">364 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. XLIII advantage in the myriad diversity seen in flowers, much less any advantage great enough to have been of sig- nificance in directing to any notable degree the trend of evolution? It is usually assumed that dichogamuy, hetero- styly, prepotency of foreign pollen, and zygomorphy are advantageous characters because they promote cross pollination or pollination by special insects, but the facts on which such conclusions are based are very slender. There are many plants which are regularly close-polli- nated and they seem to succeed as well as others. The Composite are often regarded as the highest of the seed plants, and they are of especial interest because they are a group that is ecologically successful as well as morpho- logically advanced, features that often fail to coincide elsewhere. But the Compositm show comparatively little zygomorphy or insect selection; as a group they are notably geitonogamous or even autogamnous, and yet none of the supposed disadvantages of close pollination are evident. Indeed the massing of flowers in heads and the consequent facilitation of pollination between near-by flowers may be one of the reasons for their great success. But there are rea-sons for believing that any or all kinds of pollination are vastly inferior to vegetative reproduc- tion in determining the success of a group. The notable success of the grasses and sedges is doubtless due to their rhizomes far more than to their flowers, and in the duck- weeds and many aquatics the flower has become almost a negligible quantity. Such considerations make it at- least doubtful whether many conspicuous floral structures possess the great advantages in the life of plants that have been commonly ascribed to them. The conception that plant structures may often have originated quite independently of any important use or function, or even independently of any environmental influence is useful at many points. It explains how there can exist the phenomenon of " over-adaptation," which appears to be exhibited in the orchid flower and in the testa of many xerophytic seeds. It makes possible a new</page><page sequence="10">No. 510] PROBLEMS IN PLANT ECOLOGY 365 and seemiingly saner ecological classification of plant structures. The work of Witte seems to show that plant forms may be either obligate or facultative, that is that they may be inherent or may be subject to environmental control. In a xerophytic flora, such a~s that studied by Witte in Sweden, there are many plants of dwarf habit. Experi- ment shows that these dwarfs behave very differently in mesophytic conditions. Some develop into tall and luxuriant plants, while others remain as truly dwarf as in xerophytic soil. The dwarfness of the former is facul- tative, of the latter obligate. The former is clearly a response or reactive xerophyte, owing its form to its sur- roundings; the latter appears to be an inherent or con- genital xerophyte, the cause of whose development is as yet unknown. It is probable that further experiment along these lines will show that many other plant forms apparently identical are most unlike in nature and origin. Time will permit but one further illustration. In nmeso- phytic forests one sometimes finds plants that appear to be xerophytes. A notable example of this is seen in many species of Begonia and Peperomia that grow in the depths of the rain forest. Both in external aspect and in all the details of leaf structure such plants appear xerophytic; it seems almost certain that these plants are congenital xerophytes, species whose xerophytism is stamped upon them to such an extent that age-long ex- posure to the moisture of the rain forest has not de- stroyed it. Whether congenital forms in the final anal- ysis differ in any radical degree from reactive forms can not now be told; it may be that all plants are or have been plastic, but it is clear that the recognition of the double possibility in the interpretation of plant structures is at present advantageous. A minor but necessary matter is tlhat of terminology. One of the unfortunate features about language is that expressions lag behind ideas. Long ago we knew that the heart is not the seat of the emotions, but our language</page><page sequence="11">366 THE AM1ERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. XLIII still retains the old phrases. We continue to speak of the rising and setting of the sun. In like manner we still employ such terms as adaptation, adjustment, accorn- modation and regulation, although these are vitalistic words which imply that plants and animals can transcend their environment and can contravene the ordinary laws of matter (though it is to be pointed out that the word adaptation is harmless when used objectively). The old- time ecologist was very alnthropomorphic and delighted in words derived from OfACX6 (I love). Ecological litera- ture is still burdened with such words as xelrophile, geophilous and entom-iophily; particularly objectionable is the word mlyrinecophily, since it is found that plants merely endure the visits of the ants. Such terms as storage and reserve food appear to imply forethought on the part of the plant and should be abandoned. Words like normal and type are far too freely used, for it can not be emphasized too much that one structure or habit is about as, normal or typical as any other. The word fimction, which is per se harmless, has almost come to be a synonym of purpose and may.y, perhaps, give way largely to role. It, is not an inconsequential matter that we clothe our ideas with words that are correct and adequate. It is worth the effort, even if we are obliged to substitute a. cumbersome. though scientific phrase for a euphonious but anthropomorphic word. But of course our language is less important than our thoughts. Our scheme of philosophy is fundamental, for it determines the motive, the scope and the direction of our research. The -most blighting of philosophies is that which predicates a maxi- aium of dogma, the most stimulating is that which de- nmands a maximum of experimental test. DISCUSSION ON PROFESSOR COWATLES 'S PAPER. PROFESSOR SHAWAr: If we should, as Professor Cowles says, discard the word "storage" and, in short, if I uilderstand him correctly, all the words which carry teleological ideas, I should like to inquire what we shall say. What resources of the lailguage shall we use to talk to a class about a starchy tuber and avoid implying purposeful adaptation?</page><page sequence="12">No. 510] PROBLEMS IN PLANT ECOLOGY 367 PROFESSOR COWLES: It is a difficult question that Professor Shaw asks, I have been working at that for several years, aid I have not all of the answer yet, but I have part of it. We now use the word "'response,'" which I am convinced is expressive of no teleological idea. To speak of a response in the living and noon-living will auiswer nearly all purposes, and is entirely free from teleological ideas. The Word "'storage " is more difficult to handle; personally I use the word accumulation. Take the word "gall," for instance-oak gall; dne would hardly teach his class that an oak gall stores, but to speak of food accumulation of an oak gall is not incorrect. PROFESSOR CLEMENTS: It seems to me that Professor Cowles puts emii- phasis on the wrong part of the dilemmina. If we change our ideas in the proper direction, it is not at all important what we call them. ''Response'" implies more of vitalism than adaptation, yet I would adopt the idea and let the word stand. DR. LIVINGSTON: We soimetimies try to cut short our expressions too much, as there is a tendency in all things to adopt shorter expressions in- stead of long ones, and finally a phrase comes to be a single word, and if the process goes on long enough, a short one. In the present stage of ecology, there is perhaps too much tendency to cut our phrases clown to single words before the majority of people who are using the words have yet appreciated what the phrase means, and I am quite agreed with Professor Cowles that we can sometimes -find other words, as in the case of accumu- lation instead of storage, which will express the point; but, I think that in many cases, in order to keep our ideas clear, so that elementary students understand them, we must express the thing in mathematical language, so as to say exactly what we mean. With reference to adaptation, there are one or two points which ecologists have had to study, and of which Professor Cowles makes no special mention, viz., the survival of the fittest and the operation of natural selection in the succession of certain plants. In the survival of the fittest species, for instance-what makes these species the fittest? It is their adaptation to their environment. We may be able to disprove certain specific cases of adaptation that have been passing current and taken for granted for years, but can we get rid of the general idea at all? PROFESSOR COWLES: These are points which I had to leave out of my paper, on account of my limited time. Personally I distinguish between adaptation in the subjective anci in the objective sense. It is quite correct to speak in these plants of survival: I object to the use of language implying that these plants adapt themselves in the subjective sense. The use of the word in the objective sense is all right, but the subjective use of it I object to. PROFESSOR HARSHBERGER: Some one has said that our ideas never keep pace with the growth of our language, and our language never with our ideas. That has always been found the case in making hard and fast terminology. Where we assign a particular name to a definite idea and purpose, in a short time our ideas change so that our term has to be made more elastic. Now it seems to me that one of the difficulties always being met with is having to adapt our language to our changing ideas. Would'</page><page sequence="13">368 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. XLIII it not be better to have a less hard and fast terminology, to have a few terms that are generally applicable, and then use in a definite way a description, so that a person, in reading the description, will of necessity get from that description the idea which the author wishes to convey, and instead of building up a vast terminology, we shall have a few simple terms of general application, and apply these terms with latitude, so that with the growth of our ideas, beginners or even the person who has been accustomed to the use of the words, will have a chance to adapt the new ideas to the old terminology? PROFESSOR IBOLLEY: If, as Professor Cowles says, plants respond to stimulation, will he grant that these responses may be hereditary, and if they are hereditary-why is it not adaptation? PROFESSOR COrALES: I would rather not go into this question of heredity. I don 't think we know enough about it to ask or answer that. I don 't believe it has been proved that there could be such response as is suggested, nor have we disproved it.</page></plain_text>
