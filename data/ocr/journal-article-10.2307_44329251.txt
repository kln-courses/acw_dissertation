<plain_text><page sequence="1">CITIES IN BEZIQUE : ADRIENNE KENNEDY'S EXPRESSIONISTIC VISION By Kimberly W. Benston I Afro-American drama has, until recently, been rooted in the mimetic tradition of modern Euro-American realism. Yet con- temporary black playwrights have come to reject increasingly the formal limitations of the theatrical mainstream to which they are heirs. For the naturalism of which Hansberry's, Bald- win's, Bullins's, and Imamu Baraka's early works are ex- emplary seems to be satisfied, more or less, with the forms it finds in life: prose; non-figurative language; an illusion of non- selected events; a " natural " sense of emphasis; and a non- musical (not necessarily cacophonous) sound. The most dis- tinctive attribute of this form is its guiding sociological and materialistic conception of man. Naturalism takes man to be a part and function of his environment and depicts him as a being who, instead of controlling concrete reality, is himself controlled and absorbed by it. The milieu takes a preponderant part in shaping human destiny; all actions, decisions, and feelings contain an element of the extraneous, something that does not originate in the subject and that makes man seem the unalterable product of a mindless and soulless reality. So long as Afro-American drama maintained naturalism as its dominant mode, then, it could do little more than express the " plight " of black people. Its heroes might declare the madness of reality but reality inevitably triumphed over them. In its search for a more triumphant vision than naturalism affords, black theatre has produced a number of agit-prop and simplistically allegorical plays. In works such as Baraka's Ex- perimental Death TJnit # 1 and Salimu's Growiri Into Black- ness , the purchase made upon reality, the means by which the playwright sought to surpass works like Bullins's Clara's Ole Man , was that of explicit moral concern. That was both their strength and their limitation. For a dramatically communicable 235</page><page sequence="2">236 Kimberly W. Benston vision could not advance its claims in the Afro-American theatre very far as long as it was simply a question of replacing naturalism's topicalities by a moral seriousness. What was needed even more than the thematic clarification produced by morality play structure was a more profound vision and, there- fore, new techniques. Hence, the didactic element had to be presumed and thereby theatrically dampened, which meant not that it had to be eliminated but that it had to be grounded in something less idealistic than moral fervor. This other grounding was provided by poetry - both linguistic and vis- ual - the rising prestige of which was due to the growing em- phasis on both spirituality and the development of black self- hood. For the Black Arts Movement, Baraka's Four Black Revolu- tionary Plays showed the way to putting new life into sterile forms, and even though the salient feature of these works is their platitudinous satire, stirrings of a more profound insight were evident. Yet more quietly, less influentially, the strange, surrealistic plays of Adrienne Kennedy had already taken the first steps toward a complete departure from naturalism. The overall effect of her oeuvre, from Funnyhouse of a Negro (1962) to Sun (1970) , is one of mystery, mythic fantasy, and poetic ambiguity. The growing interest in and appreciation of her work among Afro-American artists and critics attest to their increased acceptance of expressionistic, or " subjective " ex- plorations of the black psyche. Cities in Bezique 1 - a dramatic distich composed of The Owl Answers and A Beast Story - is one of Kennedy's most complex and lyrically beautiful pieces. Though written at different times, these plays are quite clearly complementary investiga- tions of black identity organized around a specific cluster of themes (sexuality, family/tribal structure, death) and symbols (animals, light/dark motifs, musical accompaniments, and in- numerable objects of all kinds) . Together they provide an excellent model of Kennedy's dramaturgy and vision. 1 All quotations from Cities in Bezique are from Kuntu Drama, ed.

Kennedy's settings, for example, are a mixture of real and surreal which reinforces the plays' thematic ambiguities: The Owl Answers takes place in a subway that is simultaneously St. Peter's, the Tower of London, and a Southern black preacher's den; the set of A Beast Story is the " gloomy house of a minister in a drab section of a midwestern city " that is transformed into a bleak landscape of monsters, apparitions, and nightmares. Kennedy includes with her text a " costume plot " and set de- sign, thereby emphasizing the importance of visual elements in the total meaning of her work. Most crucial is the way in which an economy of symbols and motifs, usually concretized by objects such as the ax in A Beast Story or by symbolic figures such as The Owl Answers9 s Negro Man, join with spec- tacular and supernatural effects to create an aura of lyric other- worldliness and a conciseness of dramatic statement. The result of such an assembling and ordering of symbols is to add a function to action itself. Instead of treating a plot that explores human relations in their moral aspect, Kennedy makes action into another signature of emotion. It is not an end in itself, flowing from and dependent on what we naturalis- tically call " character," but invokes instead the intimacies, ecstasies, and anguish of the Afro-American's soul-life. In her plays, relations between men matter less than the struggle of a soul with an all-enveloping spiritual mystery. The coherent action-sequence that illustrates the moral nature of black life (' vide Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun or Bullins's The Corner) gives place to a complex pattern communicating a spiritual in- sight. In this pattern action is sometimes, it is true, an element of the life of human relations; more often it is an element of the unseen life of the soul and of spiritual powers, presented in poetry through anthropomorphic images. In the mingling of these elements of seen and unseen, of natural and fantastic, of human and divine, " action " comes</page><page sequence="4">238 Kimberly W. Benston to have the force of symbol, and conversely symbol assumes sometimes the character of action. Kennedy opened the way for black writers to become poetic dramatists rather than sim- ply dramatic poets. Her plays allow the spectator to close the gap between himself and the spectacle only by an act of in- terpretation. Thus, a typical Kennedy drama invades the spec- tator's mind, putting him in intimate contact with the inner visions he and the playwright share. Ultimately, the charac- ters' struggles become the audience's empathie concern. m The Owl Answers is what Paul Carter Harrison would call a Hantu form 2 ; that is, its structure turns upon a fluid time / space relationship which eschews linear presentation of images in favor of a more interpretive and poetic design. Thus the multiple personalities of the characters and their various en- vironments change rapidly, often obscurely, and together form an intricate matrix of associations which alone defines the totality of their world. The main figure is " She Who Is Clara Passmore who is The Virgin Mary who is The Bastard who is the Owl " ; she has come from Georgia to London to mourn her Dead White Father who was once " Goddam Father who is the richest White Man in the Town" and who is also her stepfather, the black Reverend Passmore. She Who Is is held prisoner in the Tower of London by a chorus composed of Shakespeare, Chaucer, William the Conqueror, and Anne Boleyn (who is also both the Bastard's Black Mother - once a cook for Goddam Father - and the Reverend's wife) . SHE's attempt to assume the white, English patrimony of the Dead Father by visiting his bier, which lies in St. Paul's, is the play's central action. SHE's claim is to the lineage of her blood an- cestors, a claim made poignant by the juxtaposition of her love for English culture and her brutal rejection by the chorus of exemplary Anglo-Saxon heroes: SHE. My father loved you William . . . THEY. interrupting. If you are his ancestor why are you a Negro? . . . 2 See The Drama of Nommo (New York: Grove Press, Inc., 1972).</page><page sequence="5">Advienne Kennedy's Expressionistic Vision 239 SHE . Let me into the chapel. He is my blood father. I am almost white, am I not? ... I am his daughter. For SHE, as Robert L. Tener has observed,3 the search for the father and the quest for identity become one. While the in- dividual roles of the father and mother are unique beings, each representative of a distinct and partially valid aspect of SHE's ancestry, SHE's roles are fragments of a single personality, either designated imperialistically by others or personally em- braced in her desperate pursuit of selfhood. THEY are cold, abstract, aloof; she moves among their apparitions desiring love in a lifeless world: DEAD FATHER rises, goes to her, then dies again. Great clang. BASTARD'S BLACK MOTHER shakes a rattle at SHE. SHE screams at the DEAD FATHER and the MOTHER. SHE. You must know how it is to be filled with yearning. THEY. laugh . Finally, a dark Negro Man, whom SHE calls " God," tries to supplant her vision of love with the sordid sexuality of a Harlem hotel: NEGRO MAN . What is it? What is it? What is wrong? (He tries to undress her. Underneath her body is black. He throws off the crown SHE has placed on him.) . . . Are you sick? SHE . (smiles) No, God. (SHE is in a trance.) No, I am not sick. I only have a dream of love. A dream. Her dream-world bursts into flame as she and the Negro Man grapple in a space that is suddenly transformed from hotel room to High Altar. SHE's once-calm demands upon the past give way to a final hysteria in which she strips through each available identity - Clara, the Negro child of Reverend Pass- more; Mary, the martyred Virgin; Bastard, the Mulatto daugh- ter of Dead White Father - until, enflamed and dripping in her suicidal mother's blood, she at last becomes the mysterious Owl. 8 " Theatre of Identity: Adrienne Kennedy's Portrait of the Black Woman," Studies in Black Literature , 6, no. 2 (Summer, 1975), 2.</page><page sequence="6">240 Kimberly W. Benston The owl, solitary, wise, dispassionate, cries out the question embedded within the name " SHE WHO IS " - Whooo? Denied the complex legacy of her blood ancestors, surrounded by de- ception and death, SHE nearly answers by asserting an identity with the nocturnal creature. Yet this concluding statement is only a muted, seemingly painful, and ultimately enigmatic moan: " Ow. . .ow." 4 One of the most notable features of this play is the addition to naturalistic psychological torment of symbolic overtones that actually alter the character's psyche as they resonate at climac- tic moments, so that, as the play progresses, character becomes symbol and the work moves into another dimension entirely. Kennedy's plays require of their audiences a sensitivity to these shifts in aesthetic key - some slight, some abrupt, some daring - and especially to those moments of symbolic expansion when the characters lunge forward, thrusting their significance at the beholder. The feeling of dislocation that the audience experi- ences as the plays move back and forth between the realistic psychological mode and the symbolic one involves it in a con- stant, conscious process of readjustment to the fictional world. It also accounts, in considerable part, for the sense of menace that pervades Kennedy's work. But it is the threat of meaning, of horrible or blinding revelation, rather than the threat of violence that lies at the root of this menace. It is the fear that what lurks in the inner self and the collective past will emerge still-born, grotesque, or useless. The result is that when the audience begins to hear the play's symbolic resonances it also begins to feel the special frightening unease characteristic of them. For that sense of menace is intimately related to a para- doxical phenomenon: the further the plays move into the sym- bolic realm, the nearer they come to the world of the audience itself. In a work like The Owl Answers , Kennedy is pioneering for black theatre a subjective-critical mode which is a deeply in- novative dramatic response to the visionary aspect of the Black Arts Movement. The conventional nature of her drama 4 Tener's article provides an extensive review of the possible mythic sig- nificances associated with the owl symbol. See Ibid., 1-5.</page><page sequence="7">Adrìenne Kennedy's Expressionistic Vision 241 should be clear; borrowing from both the folk-tale and the Strindbergean dream-play, it crashes the barriers of realism by establishing a lyric metaphysical emphasis. A Beast Story is essentially an extension of The Owl Answers in theme and technique. Yet in the later play pretensions to realism are shed even more while the symbolic investigations of identity, sex- uality, and death are rendered with greater clarity. In ad- dition, A Beast Story adds to The Owl Answers an interest in the confused relation betwen Nature and the self - the ani- mal and the social being inscribed into and enacted out of a single consciousness. The multi-dimensional personalities of The Owl Answers are reduced in A Beast Story to stark, monolithic figures whose only role-fragmentation is evinced in their dual nature of " beast " and Negro. The four characters - Beast Woman, Beast Man, their daughter Beast Girl, and Beast Girl's husband Dead Human - form a " black family " locked in a timeless struggle of wills, desires, and antipathies. The Owl Answers' s study of ancestral connection is here supplanted by a concern with the poisonous inheritances possible within a given family structure.5 Beast Man, a minister, has performed the marriage rite for his daughter and her now dead lover. This event was shrouded in uncertainty and accompanied by evil portents. Yet for Beast Girl it seemed a moment of perfection in which the truth of selfhood was found: Beast Girl . My father preached our wedding service and a black sun floated over the altar. A crow flew through an open window while my mother played the organ and the black sun floated. . . . He had to stop singing, he had to stop singing, the room was silent. ... It was morning when I awakened, a red sunrise morning, the first day of my mar- riage. At last I knew who I was ... no shadow of myself, I was revealed ... to myself. The darkened sky, ominous bird, and interrupted ceremony are merely outward signs of the horror that awaits the young 6 In this respect, A Beast Story resembles such plays as Ron Milner's Who's Got His Own, Lonne Elder's Ceremonies in Dark Old Men, William Wellington Mackey's Family Meeting , and Baraka's Great Goodness of Life.</page><page sequence="8">242 Kimberly W. Benstori couple. Beast Girl, stalked by her enigmatically lustful father and frightened of her sexuality by her mother's passionate denial ("I cut the throat of a pigeon poult to keep myself untouched ") , shuns her husband's advances. They struggle and he wins. Their child seems to her a reward of sin; her parents force her to kill it and, with a countenance of ravaged innocence, she slays her husband also. Beast Girl's acts of murder are to be seen in two terms: the religious outrage of life's denial and the chaotic sensuality of passion in which death, too, plays its part. Beast Girl is forced into a criminal position which is repulsive to her. She accepts her acts as final and yet her obligation remains to herself, a conscience which will not allow her an artificial martyrdom. It is plain that in the background of elemental, sexual struggle between father and mother - initiated by Black Man and Black Woman and tragically repeated by Beast Girl and Dead Human - is the issue of the emergence of woman as an in- dividual. She comes to recognize the destructive cycle of sup- pressed desire, bestiality, and death which her forebears - " southern Negroes who came to the city " - have traversed: Beast Girl. My father built a crib. (Staring at her father.) How he loved me, saw me in the crib, circled by the golden aureole. My mother. Black shadows were etched under those pale eyes, for she hardly slept at night and suffered endless wakeful fits. . . . Above the bed hung a doleful picture of the Virgin and Child. . . . Now the moon is out. A bird perches on my bedpost, a great toad runs through the house. I killed his baby with quinine and whiskey. Beast Girl seems to divine, as the play progresses through moments of accusation and insight, that the antidote to her parents' sublimation of inherited burdens is violent repudiation. Killing her husband and child, however, is useless and coward- ly - their ever-present forms and the wild beasts (jackal, toad, crow) who are " glad " at their passing attest to her continued weakness. Haunted by the "nightmares and visions" of her mysterious father (Beast Girl: " My father comes toward me, saying something I do not comprehend and the sky turns black ") , Beast Girl is finally driven to an apocalyptic destruc-</page><page sequence="9">Advienne Kennedy's Expressionistic Vision 243 tiveness. As her parents look on with satisfaction, she hacks away at the monsters and loved ones of her life, ending in utter despair: A bilie crow behind her, she turns and instantly kills it with the ax . A giant toad hops to the room, Croaking . She sees it and wildly axes it to pieces. Beast noises . She swings the ax, wildly screaming . Noises louderé She drops the ax, falls down weeping. Silence Beast Man and Beast Woman. Now the sky above our house is blue, three robins with red chests appear on the horizon. All is warm and sunlit. Silence. Strange bright sunlight, then darkness. I have traced the narrative of A Beast Story in a summary way, omitting a mass of detail, because it is necessary to assert that the play is a controlled formulation of a specific theme. The play's inquiry, when its pattern is accepted, can be seen, not as obscure, but as a powerfully original projection of deeply considered experience. It deals with the impossibility of main- taining a dream untarnished - specifically, the dream of identity achieved through love - amid the corruption which is life. The play is unrelentingly melancholy - we have sublimations and deaths, tiredness and disillusion, frustration and disenchant- ment. The cultural institutions it probes, from the family to the " Old Spirituality " represented by Beast Woman's insidious prayers and vanity-table altars, are depicted as vapid and ruinous. As the sun turns black at Beast Girl's wedding, so her world grows dark until only the " strange " light of her failure illumines it again. Nevertheless, the final impression left by Cities In Bezique is painfully complex. Though Kennedy's heroines are caught in webs of congenital horrors, products of both the history of race and the human condition, they still pass through crisis to epiphany, shattering though this process may be. Moreover, a more concrete, positive apologue is discernible in both plays: neither SHE nor Beast Girl fully embrace the realities of her past, her sexuality, or her blackness. The menacing quality of their unfulfilled quests is perhaps less a reflection of the author's</page><page sequence="10">244 Kimberly W . Benston nihilism than a warning to those who look on. Kennedy fur- nishes her plays with a reality of motives and inclinations but her world is like a beachhead on the edge of a darkness teeming with a host of spirits, generally inimical to man. Her plays leave an impression of restlessness and an unresolved longing to believe. They have helped infuse an overriding and overt spiritual impulse into black theatre. Thus far, it has been left to others to evolve in this spiritual mode from search to celebra- tion. Yale University New Haven , Connecticut</page></plain_text>
