<plain_text><page sequence="1">Betty's turn STEPHEN MELVILLE 1. Acknowledgment and revelation "What," Stanley Cavell asks, "does it mean to say that a painter discovers, by painting, something true of all paintings? Is it a case of something hidden in unconsciousness becoming conscious?"1 It is a good, tough question. His own immediate answer is: It is like something hidden in consciousness declaring itself. The mode is revelation. I follow Michael Fried in speaking of this fact of modernist painting as an acknowledging of its conditions. Any painting might teach you what is true of all painting. A modernist painting teaches you this by acknowledgment?which means that responding to it must itself have the form of accepting it as a painting, or rejecting it. Cavell goes on to both give a general sense of what he means here ("a painting may acknowledge its frontedness, or its finitude, or its specific thereness") and supply a gloss in terms of painting after Pollock? most particularly in terms of a certain play of candor, frankness, and finish in Morris Louis's "Unfurleds." I take the turn from "something hidden in unconsciousness becoming conscious" to "something hidden in consciousness declaring itself" to be not a rejection of the thought of an unconscious but rather a deft rephrasing of precisely that thought, thus enabling the next paragraph's remark that: in reasserting that acknowledgement is the home of knowledge, [modernism] recalls what the remainder of culture is at pains to forget. To speak now of modernism as the activity of an avant-garde is as empty as it is in thinking about modern politics or war, and as comforting: it implies a conflict between a coherent culture and a declared and massed enemy; when in fact the case is more like an effort, along blocked paths and hysterical turnings, to hang on to a thread that leads from a lost center to a world lost.2 I take it that any attempt to explore Cavell's question and answer further will have a certain reading of Freud as one of its dimensions,3 just as I take the implicit play between the necessity of judgment and a certain loss of the world to point toward a reading of Kant also at work here.4 And finally I take it that the attempt to go on with Cavell's answer must be at least partially motivated by a sense that we are still far from done with the emptiness and comfort (isn't this just to say "nihilism"?) that Cavell clearly takes as some kind of barrier, or at least alternative, to what he means by "acknowledgement." The essay that follows will for the most part keep its distance from these larger theoretical frames and issues, which is why it is perhaps worth marking their underlying presence at the outset. A reluctance some readers may feel about going on with Cavell's thought here is likely to come to a particular focus around the sentence: "The mode is revelation." "Revelation" is not, I think, a word we are fully comfortable with?we are very quick to take it as aimed beyond the terms of the world. This suspicions seems to me complex and difficult to disarm, but it may be useful to underline the relative ordinariness of the term?the way in which it is just the right word for those moments when we see that this particular bit of a print that we took for cast shadow is actually a bit of underbrush or make out that this bit in a painting we took for a highlight is instead a reflection. Often we register this as a kind of passage from seeing to reading? the kind of thing that lets us understand without difficulty a sentence like (to take an example at once arbitrary and familiar enough) Wolfflin's assertion that "everything depends on how far a preponderating significance is 1. Stanley Cavell, The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1979), p. 109. 2. One is surely meant to hear in this echoes of a key formulation from Cavell's "Knowing and Acknowledging" (1969): "A 'failure to know' might just mean a piece of ignorance, an absence of something, a blank. A 'failure to acknowledge' is the presence of something, a confusion, an indifference, a callousness, an exhaustion, a coldness. Spiritual emptiness is not a blank. ?Just as, to say that behavior is expressive is not to say that the man impaled upon his sensation must express it in his behavior; it is to say that in order not to express it he must suppress the behavior, or twist it. And if he twists it far enough or often enough, he may lose possession of that region of the mind which that behavior is expressing." Stanley Cavell, Must We Mean What We Say? (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 264. 3. Cavell's interest in psychoanalysis becomes an increasingly prominent feature of his work over the course of his career and is strongly inflected by Lacan. One might note, for example, the good fit between Cavell's remark about what is "hidden in consciousness" and the general terms of Lacan's celebrated seminar on "The Purloined Letter." 4. Immanuel Kant seems to me the strongest and most important figure here, but of course the sense of a mourning or melancholia endemic to modernism is widespread (see, for a recent overview of this in particular relation to art and its history, Michael Ann Holly, "The Melancholy Art," The Art Bulletin LXXXIX, no. 1 [March 2007] :7-17).</page><page sequence="2">32 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 assigned to or withdrawn from the edges, whether they must be read as lines or not/'5 Did Wolfflin refer to "reading" because he discovered that what was to be seen still needed words for it? Wolfflin's experience cannot be cleanly separated from similar experiences of the world, moments where a thing seen but not caught finds its visual ground, snaps into new focus, connecting up with the more general interpretability of things.6 Typically, these moments feel like moments of recognition?something one had not managed to know or had somehow mistaken gets rightly known, fully fitted into a context in which it had been a momentary disturbance, and so also affirms a certain self-understanding. More often than not, the kind of revelation that calls for acknowledgment works the other way around, disturbing a context that had seemed settled, so that the revelation does not put an end to something and instead engenders a demand, makes a difference?something follows for me from seeing that. Michael Baxandall often builds his revelations out of small recognitions, as when he says, of Chardin's Lady Taking Tea, "if the teapot were white it would fall off the table" or "behind all this colorful bustle, a little behind even her dress, is the lady . . . "7 Fred Licht's observation that in Goya's Session of the Company of the Philippines "even the carpet, an element that was always used by earlier painters to introduce a comprehensible, continuous bridge between the front and back of a composition, does not help us to orient ourselves in space"8 does the same kind of work, although it may also feel as if the registration of this detail is all but immediately a revelation of the painting or its space as a whole. I recall a lecture by Fried on Kenneth Noland that turned on the moment at which he announced Noland's "discovery" that the point of his use of chevrons could be lifted from the bottom of the canvas; Fried figured this as first of all a revelation to Noland, while for me at least it was quite simply a revelation of "Noland," and so the opening of an obligation I had not previously known myself to have. But of course now we seem to have definitively crossed that line we believe we know better than to cross: There is nothing?no detail, no particular bit of close reading?Fried is drawing our attention to, nothing we discover ourselves to have known wrongly and now see rightly; we saw all there was to see and saw it rightly enough?and so the revelation, should it come, is a more naked version of the revelation that came upon Baxandall and Licht. We are asked to acknowledge that what we had known to be a painting is indeed a painting, and with that acknowledgment our knowledge is put in its place. The statement that the grey background to most but not all of Gerhard Richter's 1988 portrait of his daughter Betty (fig. 1) can only be a rendering of one of his own grey monochromes hanging on the wall behind or before her may be revelatory in two ways. First, by indicating what something in the painting is, such a statement indicates something crucial about how the painting as a whole is?it shows that it is a painting. (That we already knew this is irrelevant in the face of our new sense of it.) Second, this statement makes clear that the background?or more exactly the little patch of cream at the very bottom right of the painting that sets the grey off?is hardly the first thing we notice about Betty. What we notice first, I imagine, is her?that is, presumably, some mix of the patterned jacket or sweater and the little we have of a head turned away from us. It is clear enough that we are in front of a portrait?format, content, title all underline that?but most of what we expect and want from a portrait is not given to us; we have no actual sense of what this person looks like and know only that she is young. For all that, we are sure that she is a particular someone (the photograph that it so clearly depends on or continues plays a part in locking in that sense). What is this portrait of a person evidently not facing us, not facing the painter? Why don't we take it as refusing or denying us something? 2. Painting and facing Paintings face us. The statement seems true enough, but its sense and interest are hardly clear. It could be a special thing to say, called forth by some particular situation or work?for example, we might encounter a people who turn their works to the wall; then we might have some reason to say something like: "Oi/r paintings face us." Outside of such peculiar circumstances, does 5. Heinrich Wolfflin, Principles of Art History: The Problem of the Development of Style in Later Art, trans. M. D. Hottinger (New York: Dover Publications, 1950), p. 19. 6. And here, of course, we touch on other dimensions we can expect to figure in any effort to go on with Cavell's remarks: a certain proximity to Heidegger on interpretation and a particular orientation to the difference language makes to the visual (Derrida, early on, tries to catch this by saying "there is no such thing as perception," but it's at least as accurate, and perhaps more useful, to say that language makes the difference to what would otherwise be purely visual). 7.

And if so, is it true of all of them in the same way, or is it something painting can, so to speak, work on or take a stance toward? Is it a literal statement or a metaphor of some kind? This last question turns out to have a somewhat surprising answer. The word "face" itself is, etymologically, a metaphor or catachresis deriving from the Latin facere (to make or to set up), the infinitive, whose perfect form (fecit) is, of course, one way of signing a painting. It suddenly seems oddly tempting to say that the word face is itself a metaphor derived from something like painting, something made and set up. When we learn that "visage" derives from visus (to be seen) and</page><page sequence="4">34 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 "countenance" from continere (to contain), the very notion of a face becomes somewhat unstable, unsure of its own ground. Or, to put it a little differently, we notice, somewhat surprisingly, that our ways of naming this thing so intimately involved with our sense of ourselves do so as if from the outside?as what is set up, what is seen, what contains. . . . We might have expected the roots of such a word to have been more "inward," more bound up with subjectivity or some notion of expressivity. "Expression" is of course a word we can use to describe faces. We say, among other things, that faces wear expressions. All of this has no particular use or destination. It is a kind of finger-exercise, the good of which, if any, is to make "facing"?the word and the fact?odd enough that one might be prepared to entertain the thought that paintings' facings of us may be worth remarking and that they may be so in part because our facings of one another are not without their own questions and uncertainties. * Facing Velazquez's Las Meninas?that is, doing so now, in a certain context (Betty's context) and in a certain mood (self-reflective or self-critical)?I might begin with the various portraits embedded in it: of the infanta, of her attendants, to many of whom art history can assign names, and of Velazquez himself at work on his painting. That painting itself is (on the evidence not of any of these figures but of another figure or figures not directly shown in it but presumably standing more or less in the position of its viewer) a portrayal of Philip and Isabella, king and queen of Spain?a reading evidently secured, more or less on the rebound, by the small portraits, identifiably of Philip and Isabella, painted as if in a mirror at the rear of the work. That we read this as a mirror is a function both of its clear legibility in contrast with the apparent paintings hanging on the same wall and the general turning of the figures in the painting toward the space we take the mirror to reflect. While the presiding perspective scheme seems clear enough in general, it does not appear to be immediately clear in detail, and it is possible that what is reflected in this mirror are not the king and queen themselves but the painting we presume to be of them and before?or behind?which Velazquez shows himself standing. However these readings fare in detail?and much recent ink has been devoted to working this out?it seems clear enough that the presence of Philip and Isabella as at once viewers and objects of the scene?as subjects in a' double sense?is forcefully implied by the painting; we may be less certain how far we want to say that those other figures shown in the painting?the Infanta, the painter, the others?are to be taken as viewing the king and queen and how far they are merely exposed to their sovereign gaze. If we move away from the figures portrayed, we may be tempted to say that the remainder of the painting explores or presents with a certain systematic insistence a variety of figures for painting itself. Moving roughly left to right these would include: the canvas not facing us but whose back we see; the other paintings barely visible on the back wall and to which art history can also assign names in some instances (Rubens prominent among them); the mirror; the door in which yet another figure is silhouetted; and the window on the right. Many will be tempted to include the frankly painted wall through which that window opens in this list as well; how far one is willing to go will probably depend on just how powerfully the other elements I mentioned strike you as orienting the painting to an exploration of its own condition of making and presentation. Velazquez shows himself painting?that is, he shows himself in the standard position of self-portraiture?and given the apparent fair-enough fit between the painting we see and the canvas portrayed on it, there is a strong invitation to tacitly take him to be at work on the painting we are in fact looking at (it is much harder to imagine that he is working on a portrait reflected in that mirror). This view is of course palpably at odds with the other things I said or implied about the painting (that it is of the king and queen, that it was of the infanta up until the moment of royal interruption). It is in that sense wrong, and it cannot be optically right in any way?but the temptation is locked in place before us by a variety of other elements: the sense that the painting is interested in exploring its own status as painting; the vague echoing of Velazquez by the courtier in the door that twins the mirror; the fact that the rendering of the artist within the painting is in fact a self-portrait of the artist at work; and, I suspect, the presence within the painting of the mirror, however differently aimed and filled, that is the standard means of self-portraiture. One way to make peace with the tension among these various readings would be to say that what Las Meninas gives us, at some level, is a portrait or self-portrait not of Velazquez or any of its other subjects but a portrait or a self-portrait of painting as Velazquez understands and realizes it. If we take it this way, the claims of the painting are considerable: painting shows itself not only as subsuming all its tropes?of reflection, transparency, materiality?within itself but also as capable of</page><page sequence="5">Melville: Betty's turn 35 simultaneously displaying its front and its back, of taking in both what is within it?the scene it shows?and what lies beyond it?the king and queen, the conditions of its exposure. In making peace with our temptations, we are then not called upon to choose among them; a significant part of the painting is a determination to make all its possibilities actual, and these possibilities extend it beyond what one might otherwise assume as its inevitable material limits. It is a painting that shows painting as having within itself, as available to it, all the resources of sculpture?something the Rokeby Venus also renders explicit in its way, and something that seems integral to Velazquez's highest ambitions for painting and for his practice of portraiture in particular.9 The path I have followed generates the terms "portrait" and "self-portrait" as descriptions of the painting (and not or not simply what it represents) out of the play between the portraits within it and those other elements inside the painting that seem clearly enough to reflect on the nature of painting or paintings. They can be brought together in a term I have not used yet: We can say that this is a painting palpably concerned with questions about who or what faces which or what other, and its largest claim would be that painting faces us as sculpture does?on all sides and without concealment. That would be a way of stating its deceptive lucidity. Phrasing this relation to sculpture seems to me to call for some care. When and if we speak of a sculpture facing us, it is presumably because we are aware that there are alternatives?that if, for example, we stand behind Michelangelo's David, then David, at least, does not face us but faces away. Painting is not like this: it has only one surface and so necessarily faces us and offers no alternative possibility, which would be part of why we don't know how serious it might or might not be to say of a painting that it faces us. What I am saying about Las Meninas is then both that it is interested in measuring itself against the three-dimensionality of sculpture and the possibility of facing that comes with it, and that it is interested in defeating the contingency of such sculptural facing by showing that in painting what turns away also turns toward, that the three dimensions of sculpture find their fullest realization on the two-dimensional surface of a painting. In spending as much time as I have with Las Meninas, I am trying to make clear the kinds of circumstances in which talk of facing might be serious and even necessary, so it may be useful to end this part of the discussion with two further contrasts. Velazquez's The Fable ofArachne seems as reflexively engaged with itself (and its situation of painterly emulation) as Las Meninas, but its reflexivity unfolds differently, in a way that leads us to speak more easily of allegory than of self-portraiture. That Las Meninas poses things as it does means, in part, that it demands that we take it on at the level of description rather than of interpretation or decoding; it shows or enacts its claim rather than states it. On the other hand, Rembrandt's interest in self portraiture obviously runs very deep and is capable of informing our sense of his painting as a whole, but it seems to me unlikely that a word like "facing" will play a significant role in articulating our sense either of the self-portraits or the enterprise as a whole. Indeed, it seems in this light a notable feature of Rembrandt's self portraiture that it is not open to displaying the painter in relation to his canvas but tends instead to short-circuit that relation, as if the rendered face were linked solely to the brush or hand, visual presence rendered as material fact. The major exception to this?the 1629 Painter in His Studio at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston?seems to show the purely visual relation as a threat or a problem, something to be defeated. By contrast with both the Arachne and with Rembrandt's self-portraiture, Las Meninas appears as almost a systematic treatise on the relations between painterly and human facing, a treatise we cannot but read as utterly continuous with its facing of us, a facing in which the painting, portraiture, and self-portraiture are gathered in a particular knot. A question one might imagine as if inscribed within this knot would be: how far might we or might we not take it as a model of human facing, my being before you and your being before me? * Betty sets its subject against the overall dark-grey background of Richter's monochromes hanging on a wall 9. One might say equally and perhaps better, "all the resources of the real": The question is, I think, where one supposes Velasquez to stand in relation to the history of painting?that is, how far one sees him as consequential in its invention?as establishing something that defines itself in part over and against sculpture in a significantly new way. On this, see Louis Marin, To Destroy Painting (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995); Thomas Puttfarken, The Discovery of Pictorial Composition: Theories of Visual Order in Painting, 1400-1800 (London: Yale University Press, 2000) and my review of it, "Painting in the Pre Medium Era," Art History 27, no. 2 (April, 2004):320-324; and Victor Stoichita, The Self-Aware Image: An Insight into Early Modern Meta Painting (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997). (I should note that my awareness of the issues outlined far too glancingly here arises in no small part from conversations with Erika Naginski to whose close commentary I am greatly indebted throughout.)</page><page sequence="6">36 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 that is indicated by the small patch of cream below it.10 How far might we feel that with the recognition of this painting within the painting, a mirror has somehow also entered its space? If some intimation of that kind does seem to accompany it, do we relate to the camera that is so obviously involved in the painting? How far might our sense here be affected by what we know of Richter's studio? In Richter's major retrospective at the Tate Gallery in 1990, this painting was hung directly opposite one of his dark mirrors, a hanging I take to constitute a reading?whether Richter's or the curator's?fully consonant with the description I am offering of the painting; it is a reading and a hanging that explicitly recalls the long-time situation of Las Meninas in the Prado. Betty evidently shares with Las Meninas a concern with a question of facing enacted in a constant sliding between the painting and the painting's presumed subject that works to test its reflexive capacity. That such a comparison is even possible perhaps shows us something of Betty's ambition. The means of Richter's exploration seem much reduced in comparison with Velazquez's, of course, and any sense of the painting's actual achievement will have to reckon with the force or necessity of that reduction. At least as importantly, the terrain on which Richter's work conducts this exploration seems dramatically shifted: There is no question of a claim on a sculptural capacity to painting?the close and pressing background, itself both paint and painting, cuts off any imagination of the space in which such a claim could be entered, and the painting makes no obvious effort to inscribe its viewer within the narrow space it opens. Indeed, it presents that space as, to a high degree, a space of aversion?Betty not facing us even as her picture does. But, of course, if there is no pressure from or impulse toward sculpture in evidence here, there is ample evidence of a pressure from something other than painting?of a pressure from photography, such that it makes sense to see Betty as both turning away from her father's camera and turning toward his painting?and so we have some motive to see in the complexity of this gesture something powerfully responsive to the Velazquez. If one is at all inclined this way in seeing the painting, then it will be interesting to ask what it means that photography can take on for Richter something of 10. One may be tempted to take this patch as indicating a bench or perhaps the floor on which she is sitting, but both readings end up forcing a difficulty in her posture that renews our sense of the rather narrow and difficult space she occupies. the force of sculpture and how it can also absorb within itself the force or work of Velazquez's mirror. Betty appeared in 1988 in the context of Richter's ongoing series of Abstrakte Bilde (abstract pictures). I will have nothing to say, now or later, about these abstract paintings, although I take it for granted that it is part of one's immediate experience of them that they bear a relation to photography, however hard it may be to pin that sense to particular features of the paintings. But I do want to understand, first, how a body of painterly work divided this way has come to be possible, and, second (but this may simply restate the first point), how it has come to be compellingly visible. Before leaving Richter and bringing this long preliminary exercise to an end, I want to adduce one further piece of context for Betty? the series of paintings collectively entitled October 18, 1977 that assumes a clearly complex stance toward painting and its genres (portraiture, still life, history painting), toward photography, and toward matters of history, memory, and politics. These belong very much to Betty's time within the course of Richter's painting; thus, the sense we make of Betty should at some level make sense of them as well.11 3. Abstraction and after If Richter's means appear reduced in relation to Velazquez's, they are nonetheless expansive in relation to the main lines of abstraction that immediately precede him. In particular, abstraction in its great moment appeared as an alternative to representation and not, as it evidently is with Richter, somehow continuous with it. If with the work of Jackson Pollock we are at one kind of distance from Richter, we are also equally or more obviously at some considerable distance from Velazquez. In the best account we have of Pollock's work and the work of Abstract Expressionism in general, there is no question of painting's capacity to exhibit within itself the resources of sculpture; indeed, the claim is precisely that this is painting and nothing but.12 It is 11. Betty is the last in a short series of photo-paintings (663-1 through 663-5) embedded in the midst of a sustained suite of abstract paintings (657-666, with various sub-numbers); The October 18, 1977, paintings are assigned numbers from 667 through 674. "Dietmar Elgar has pointed out that Richter, no doubt deliberately, shifted [Betty] several numbers ahead of the October cycle in his catalogue raisonne," Stefan Gronert, Gerhard Richter: Portraits (Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2006), p. 57. 12. There is an important line of resistance to this reading, associated with Hubert Damisch and Yves-Alain Bois, that I will not consider here but that insists on Picasso and Mondrian as aimed</page><page sequence="7">Melville: Betty's turn 37 an integral part of this view of Pollock's achievement that we see such painting as having divested itself not only of representation but also of all forms of reference, and self-reference, as well as perspective, and all the other conventions that Velazquez mobilizes in his painted meditation and that enable his claims on the sculptural?conventions that Richter evidently feels once again free to draw on in making a painting like Betty. These things, this account says, are what modernism has had to surrender in order to preserve the essential claim of painting, its unique value. If with Velazquez we encounter painting performing in and exerting its claim over an expansive field supported by a generous tradition, in Pollock, and what he can stand for of Richter's relevant pictorial past, we have painting reduced by a demanding history to its essential inner terms and so operating within a distinctly contracted field. Clement Greenberg, the figure most closely associated with this reading of Pollock and modernism, tended to put this problem into particular and by now very familiar terms: The reductive tendency of modernism unfolds in the name of a need for the individual arts to secure their own proper ground under the weight of the critical force of Enlightenment; they move to do so through a process of self-criticism running from Manet down through Pollock and beyond; this process entails the constant shedding of conventions discovered to be merely external and imposed in order to arrive at something that would be "pure," Greenberg's favorite term for what I have referred to as painting and nothing but. Sometimes Greenberg understands this as a process of what he calls "Kantian self-criticism," an attempt by the individual arts to secure and make wholly visible their proper conditions of possibility and competence, and at other times he tends to put it in terms of art's sharing in the dominant modern drift toward a certain positivist materialism (these two descriptions do not necessarily set easily with one another). In the particular case of painting, purification means a movement toward pure opticality?existence only for the eye and for an eye purged of any remnants of the tactile, an eye that sees without grasping. This is a version of the values rehearsed in Las Meninas, but it is a version that has been obliged to renounce the sculptural as a painterly capacity just as it has renounced the temptation to imagine within or behind the painting any depth of meaning or illusion or penetrable space. precisely toward renewing these claims and that is able to integrate Pollock into this implied narrative in ways that open toward a very different history and set of issues than I am exploring here. Such painting is, in a rather special sense, "flat." The specialness here is that its flatness is related precisely to its ungraspability and even untouchability: If there is still some residual illusion in the painting, the depth one sees is only to be seen and cannot be sensed or felt as that into which something?a hand, a body, a sliver?might be inserted, cannot be sensed or felt as that which might contain something. Similarly any object (no matter how flat it may really be) that seems to invite at some level our real or imaginative touch, that leads us to taking our eyes as instruments of apprehension, will not be flat in Greenberg's sense?that is, will not be "optical." The flatness of painting cannot be thought of apart from its opticality: Flatness describes the modern ambition of painting insofar as it is purely visual, and thus distinct from every other medium of art as well as from the objects we encounter in everyday life or in scientific abstraction. It is in these terms that Greenberg champions the art of Picasso and Mondrian before Pollock, and of Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland after him, the whole line understood as a movement ever closer to the irreducible core of painting itself. These ways of putting Greenberg's position are well known, as is the crisis they engender with the work of Frank Stella. Appearing to some Greenbergians (although not Greenberg himself) as one more compelling move along this line, Stella's works seem to others to show that painting's flatness is, quite simply, the flatness of an object?as if, having actually arrived at the supposed irreducible core of painting, the discovery was that painting was not irreducible but showed itself to be ultimately supported by a merely conventional distinction from the equally conventional and empty notion of sculpture, so that what was left to visual art was nothing other than the condition of being an object. The work of the artists who understood Stella in this way?the work we now call Minimalist?marks a turning point in postwar American art; many would argue that it marks a turning point within modernism more largely, and some would argue that the turning in question is not within modernism but from it toward postmodernism. The particular historical force of Minimalism is clearly bound up with the way in which it represents a kind of crisis internal to the Greenbergian narrative itself, scattering its friends and enemies alike. But it is to a degree both prepared and accompanied by an assault that comes more nearly from outside the Greenbergian narrative. This is the role usually assigned to Pop Art, and for my purposes it is well emblematized by Jasper Johns's Target with Four Faces, which can be usefully contrasted with a target by Kenneth Noland, one of the</page><page sequence="8">38 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 artists Greenberg actively supported. Without trying to make the visual case, I will simply say that the Noland exemplifies one moment in the pursuit of optical flatness Greenberg so valued. The Johns, by contrast, seems to make fun of it (the Johns is in fact the earlier work); what we have here is a lumpy?because there's collage underlying the paint and the paint itself is encaustic?picture of something flat (a target here, maps and numbers and letters elsewhere in Johns), and that picture just is the painting, so it is a flat painting in an utterly un-Greenbergian sense, and if?or when?you like it, you are likely to lose all patience with the Greenbergian sense. It includes across the top a series of facial casts that are naturally enough taken as references to that Greenbergian devil Duchamp and that in their incorporated three-dimensionality play further havoc with the presumed specialness of painterly flatness as well as the concomitant radical distinction between painting and sculpture. Johns did a number of pieces more or less like this?one puts a tray of watercolors where the casts are, another casts body parts in place of the faces, still another substitutes piano keys for the boxes in which the casts are set, and in yet another the target resolves itself into a cornea. Each of these has its way of making punning, Duchampian sense, and taken together they come close to sketching out a general system of transformations at work within Johns's painting. But of course I am focusing on this one because of the faces in it, because of the way the painting conjoins a certain parodic flatness with a certain display of faciality. I say "certain display" because these are not whole faces; they are boxed: blind, hooded, or veiled. If we want to say they face us, we have to recognize that they do so in much the way people face a firing squad, a condition that no doubt helps bind them to the target they surmount, but that also means they face us without any prospect of recognition. They are kept from seeing us (that's a mercy), and we are kept from seeing them seeing (that, too, may be a mercy but a less moral one). "Facing" is clearly an odd term to use here, and we may not feel clear about whether or not it can, or how it might, count in a description of the painting. We may not know how or whether it might be taken as part of Johns's response to Abstract Expressionism. I've set the Johns up against Noland's Greenbergian optical purity. I want now to slide a further work in between?this time by Morris Louis, another of Greenberg's heroes, from the series of paintings generally referred to as "Veils" and made by pouring stain down the canvas so that the color is literally continuous with the weave of the cloth (in it, then, and not on it). Where the hoodedness or veiling of Johns's faces has everything to do with the very real and tactile depth in which they are installed, the veiledness of these paintings is strictly optical: there is nothing graspable behind the veils and they fall in front of nothing other than themselves. In this sense, they are not different from the "Unfurleds" that follow them in Louis's career, of which one can say that they open and close on nothing other than themselves. What interests me is that these things should be called "Veils" at all, and it interests me also that the "Unfurleds" should be praised in terms of their "candor," a word that can be very rich in this context (it names their openness well and at least etymologically it ties that openness to the whiteness that is the central fact of the mostly empty canvas), but that is also quite distinctly bound up with our notion of persons and how they present or disguise themselves. I am particularly caught by some remarks by Cavell, a close friend and, in effect, collaborator with Stella's leading Greenbergian supporter, Michael Fried. Cavell writes, trying to characterize the "Unfurleds": The quality I have in mind might be expressed as an openness achieved through instantaneousness?which is a way of characterizing the candid. The candid has a reverse feature as well: that it must occur independently of me or any audience, that it must be complete without me, in that sense closed to me. . . . This openness and closedness do not describe particular forms within paintings, but conditions of painting as a form of art.13 "Closedness" here seems to name something that is not a matter of concealment; indeed, as Cavell's discussion develops, this theme turns toward the question of finish both as facture and as the relation between the thing and the process that has produced it. In this instance, we do not, for example, know what sense it would make to say that the "Unfurleds" are more open as paintings than the "Veils," just as in calling the earlier series as we do, we do not imagine that the pours of color that compose them conceal anything; they are rather that in or by which what is there is revealed. If we have anything to say here it is probably just that "Veils" and "Unfurleds" alike expose something of the conditions under which painting can and must be said to face us, conditions in which closedness? an unavailability on grounds other than those of concealment, an unavailability that is caught up in and as the sheer fact of contingency?and openness happen at once, as each other's enabling condition. This is presumably an interpretation of what the textbooks call the "frankness" of modernist painting or its "laying bare 13. Cavell (see note 1), p. 111.</page><page sequence="9">Melville: Betty's turn 39 of its own mechanisms," as it is also an interpretation of Greenberg's celebrated "flatness." And I am interested in this claim because I am interested in the further thought that in facing us in this way, Louis's work may show us something about faces like our own?about how candor and limitation or contingency in or on them are not opposed states but mutual conditions. So I am clearly tempted by the thought that saying these paintings face us is a fully serious thing to say of them. You may or may not be willing to go along with that sense as I have developed it so far. But even if you do, you may well feel that this is something unique to Louis, that there is no general art historical issue here. You might, for example, turn to Pollock and suggest those works want more nearly to overwhelm than face their viewer and that to the extent there is anything in them that feels like content or reference, it has more to do with nature?say, the nature that generates such titles as Autumn Rhythm or Lavender Mist?than it does with the human visage. Interestingly, there are a number of remarks peppered through Greenberg's criticism that suggest that he does think of abstraction in relation to portraiture, or at least that he takes a certain impossibility in representing the human to be constitutive of modernist art and its drive toward abstraction. For example, in a 1943 review of shows at the Whitney and the Metropolitan, he writes that, "American painters, and to a less degree most painters since Modigliani, can no longer handle portraits and figures with true feeling. Society does not circulate an adequate notion of the human personality to which they can refer."14 Elsewhere, he writes that "present age as much as any in history lacks an operative notion, a viable concept, of the human being?a lack that is one of the 'still centers' around which the crisis of our time revolves,"15 and in the 1957 essay, "Picasso at Seventy-Five," he writes: "The ornamental or decorative treatment of the human physiognomy generates rococo associations by now that no amount of formal Tightness seems able to overcome; and in Picasso's, as in Matisse's, later painting, it is no accident that full success comes much oftener, on almost any level, where the subject tends to be more 'humanly' indifferent, as with the still life, interior, or landscape, and that there is usually a better chance of success when the human visage is suppressed."16 Clearly, all these comments are in one sense or another marginal?they are asides, marking reservations, indicating hopes or possibilities, and they seem generally to reflect a relation to the passage to abstraction that will cease to be of interest to him when that passage has been?to his mind?accomplished. Fried recalls these various Greenbergian remarks in his writings on Louis, and he does so as part of his attempt to understand the passage from Pollock to Louis.17 He's particularly interested in questions about Pollock's interest in figuration, its defeat by the mobile line and painterly skein, and its problematic renewal as a kind of negation of, or cut-out from, the web of paint that we otherwise recognize as the core of Pollock's achievement. When Fried looks to articulate the particularity of Louis's achievement, he produces a complex statement on influence that places at its center one of Pollock's late, "failed" works, Number 3, 1951, also called Image of Man, which, he claims, is rediscovered or reinvented by Louis's deployment of undrawn, stained color. Presumably?but now I go beyond the terms of Fried's readings?the way is open to look to Pollock's drawings with their frequent jumbling of an abstract and a figurative, a jumbling that shows up again late in Pollock's career with A Portrait and a Dream (1953), and so also offers a way to think about what it means when Greenberg writes "that there is usually a better chance of success when the human visage is suppressed." In particular, we may see Pollock's work in a new way as just that suppression, its nature?as painting and as support for or subject of that painting? that relation to human nature. One's sense is that there is something going on here?something that does not figure in Greenberg's explicit theoretical excurses but that importantly nerves his experience of work?may be strengthened by looking at some of his characterizations of painterly success and failure. For example, from 1945: "With many paintings and pieces of sculpture it is as if you had to catch them by surprise in order to grasp them as wholes?their maximum being packed into the instantaneous shock of sight. Whereas if you plant yourself too firmly before 14. Clement Greenberg, The Collected Essays and Criticism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), vol. 1, p. 134. 15. Ibid., vol. 2, p. 26. 16. Ibid., vol. 4, p. 32. See also ibid., vol. 2, p. 207: "Let no one think that the prominence of the human figure in Giacometti's latest work means a return to 'humanism.'

The picture does this to you, willy-nilly, regardless of whatever else is on your mind; a mere glance at it creates the attitude required for its appreciation. . . . You become all attention, which means that you become, for the moment, selfless and in a sense entirely identified with the object of your attention. . . . The picture repeats its instantaneous unity like a mouth repeating a single word."19 Remarks of this order display a rhetoric of facing at work within Creenbergian opticality and flatness, which is to say, within his understanding of modernism and its orientation to abstraction. In bringing that rhetoric to the surface, we touch on something close to the moral or political stakes at work within what may otherwise appear a purely formal theory. This thought opens the way to what seems to me a truly extraordinary remark by Greenberg. It is from 1951 and as far as I know is not repeated anywhere else in his writing: "Art demands of the artist that he censor or immolate a good part of his feeling for the very sake of art?in the public interest, as it were. Art is ultimately social, its medium social-ness incarnate."20 The first part, about the immolation of feeling, is more or less straight T. S. Eliot and should offer no particular surprise. What is, I hope, surprising is both the assertion of "social-ness" as a medium and Greenberg's willingness to use the word "medium" in this way?as something art in general, rather than a specific art, might have. "Art in general" is the terrain Minimalism claims for itself, and something like socialness does with increasing explicitness appear in its wake as art's favored medium. These are the ground on which something like portraiture reemerges in the 1970s and 1980s, and, of course, one might also want to think more broadly about how something like facing and something like socialness are more variously at work across much recent art. What will likely be striking here is how often we find ourselves looking at work that is at once confrontational and skeptical about its own visual resources, about the costs or limits of such expositions of the person.21 4. Social-ness incarnate When painting's flatness comes to be seen as the flatness of an object, the object into which it contracts and which it recognizes as its newly objective self is first of all a cube. Unlike the painting, this cube will appear unlimited in its facing: wherever we are, we are before it and it before us. No imposed conventions constrain our encounter, and that encounter is freed of the shackles of the "purely visual" so the cube appears to us whole and, in that wholeness, simple and unanalyzable?a Gestalt, then. And, appearing before it, we too find ourselves released into wholeness, no longer restricted to the mere abstraction of our eyes but bodily engaged by the work. This work is of art in general and its essential medium is its engagement of us?what Greenberg called "social ness incarnate," even as he did not admit the possibility of work directly forged of that stuff. It is Frank Stella's work that is the crux here. On the one hand, Stella's black paintings and subsequent shaped canvases may seem?and to Fried do seem?to extend the formal dialectic of modernism and so, as I am reading that dialectic, bid to renew our acknowledgments of abstract painting's capacity to face us. On the other hand?this is the reading Fried calls literal ist?these works can equally appear to break with the way painting holds candor and concealment together on or as its surface and instead move into the third dimension, taking on the look but not the history of sculpture. This contrast is important: It means that in turning to three-dimensionality the assumptions artists brought to the work were not those that emerged from painting at its perceived limit?issues I posed earlier in terms of candor as a certain play of openness and closedness in which closedness was linked to the contingency of its finish, a term whose virtue is to link the fact of surface and the particularity of form in one's experience of the work. If one's experience of Stella's work is instead the experience of something 18. Greenberg (see note 14), vol. 2, p. 34. 19. Ibid., vol. 4, p. 81. These passages are very likely to trigger certain theoretical reflexes having to do with notions of "the gaze" and "interpellation." But it should remain an open question whether theory shows us what Greenberg means or whether Greenberg's remarks illuminate the context in which certain theoretical formulations can be received and gain a certain salience. 20. Ibid., vol. 3, p. 77. 21. Donna De Salvo's 1995 exhibition "Face Value: American Portraits" (the catalogue of which was published by Flammarion in New York in 1995) provided a first occasion for thinking through many of the issues engaged in this paper. The larger context includes another show just a year earlier: See Face-Off: The Portrait in Recent Art, ed. Melissa Feldman (Philadelphia: Institute of Contemporary Art, 1994). It is worth noticing how these two titles break along the line between confrontation and skepticism.</page><page sequence="11">Melville: Betty's turn 41 incompletely as an object, arbitrarily or merely conventionally constrained to a fixed format and situation, then its closedness will no longer strike you as a condition of its openness but as the concealment or refusal of its other faces or other side. This general reading of Stella ramifies easily: The depicted forms that repeat the limits of the work may strike you as setting up a recession at odds with the claims of the surface and so pointing to a depth beyond it; they may equally strike you as setting up a system of self-reference ultimately anchored in the merely institution or conventional fact of the frame, which will then be your way of understanding what "self-criticism" in this instance means; and all of this will mean that the movement off the wall and into three dimensions will be premised on, and so give expression to, a certain experience of hollowness. What in them as paintings counts as an acknowledgment of contingency will be refigured in three dimensions as interiority, the work's withholding of itself or its meaning despite or behind its obdurate presence. This is to say that such work is necessarily experienced as hollow; that it is in fact constructed as such more often than not is, as it were, only the technical confirmation of a necessity grounded in the formal conditions of its emergence. If such works still in some sense face us, they now do so partly as we sometimes imagine things do and partly as we sometimes find people do: blankly, indifferently, holding themselves in and so also apart. The Minimalists wanted to count this as a step into pure, or at least purer, abstraction, which is why they prided themselves on their break with the "anthropomorphism" they associated with the sculpture of David Smith. Fried sees the position as more nearly that of humans refusing to present themselves as such, hiding behind their faces. He seems to find anthropomorphism less worrisome than the thought that what some humans do, with themselves or with their art, is hide their resemblance to the human?this is presumably a way toward the sense of the social or moral concern that clearly animates his attack on Minimalism. With Stella's work we seem to reach a limit of, or in, abstraction that needs thinking about. It is not the case that with it we have reached some point beyond which abstraction is no longer possible?Minimalism is the immediate disproof of that. Rather, we seemed to have reached a point beyond which the relation between abstraction and its material or conventional?painterly or sculptural?conditions can no longer be sustained, and the thought that follows is that in the new conditions of objecthood the sense of abstraction undergoes a sea change. What I am tempted to say, following (roughly) Fried, is this: The move into such abstraction, the move into what can imagine itself as socialness incarnate, is predicated on a reduction of painting's facing of us to the blankness of sheer objective individuality, supported by nothing more than the prospect of an inaccessible and immeasurable reserve. If in doing this, Minimalism also opens a new world of social and political explicitness, this odd and skeptical coupling of privacy and publicity becomes its inner lining (Warhol also, of course, participates in this tendency in his own, vastly influential way; in many ways the deepest stakes and logic of his work seem now far closer to Minimalism than to the work of, say, Johns and Rauschenberg). We have passed from a logic of painterly exposure? of painting's facing, of our being faced by it?to a logic of the object's exposure or submission to us and of its simultaneous withdrawal from or persistence beyond or behind that exposure. The status of abstraction and representation alike is radically transformed in this move, so the largish art historical claim in play is that abstraction as it emerged under the conditions of medium-specificity had a fundamentally different shape and social consequence than it has assumed in its guise as art-in-general in the wake of Minimalism. This will be interesting to the extent that we can see Minimalism as implicated in or enabling a certain return of the figure, a certain return to what will necessarily be a double project of representation and critique of representation. One way to say how this comes about would be to say that the Minimalist work contains both a self and a mirror, or, better, presents itself as a distinct play of selfhood and mirroring. In the first instance the self is that of the viewer in his or her direct engagement by the work and the mirror simply is the work insofar as it insists on returning the viewer to his or her own placement and embodiment. In another moment, the self is that which recedes behind or within the work and the mirror the means of the presence that recession denies. And in a third moment, the mirror is the viewer whose presence allows the work to recognize itself as present despite its withdrawal. The Minimalist work and its beholder point toward one another as their way of pointing to themselves and, like my finger pointing in the mirror, at once aim toward and elude themselves. The self finds and loses itself in the other, finds and loses itself before the other. And what calls itself work is just the situation in which such finding and losing take turns with one another. The viewer is not outside that circumstance. It is at least not obvious that this amounts to a serious imagination of either self or sociability.</page><page sequence="12">42 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 These lines rehearse FriecTs charges against Minimalist literalism and theatricality, and in some ways it is seeing the sense of this pairing of apparently antithetical terms that will bring Fried's critique home. The nonabstract outcome of this is a diverse body of work that exerts a considerable pressure on the practice of portraiture. This pressure is complex because it insists both on the presence of subject and on its falsification by or withdrawal from representation. The field of vision thus drifts toward becoming a field of power?a field in which the presiding questions are about who represents, who has representation imposed upon her, and what means of resistance to such imposition lie in or beyond representation. Portraiture will be obliged to find its place in a politicized visual field and as a site of contestation in that field?contestation that may be variously cast as the undermining or reversal of stereotypes, the display of discursive locations, the construction of narratives or counter-narratives, the turning of images against themselves, and their evacuation or their appropriation. * What do we imagine Greenberg concretely means in saying that "our age lacks an operative notion, a viable concept of the human being," or that "society does not circulate an adequate notion of the human personality" to which portraiture might refer? About as much gloss as he ever gives to such comments is that formal Tightness gets defeated by Rococo, and this just leaves you with whatever sense you have of Rococo and its badness, its distance from what Greenberg calls "true feeling." That is not nothing of course?our sense of the Rococo is probably firm enough to make it clear that the problem is not about resemblance (not, say, linkable to the claim that the camera has put portraiture out of business) and it is not a problem about being unable to render the human in general; it is evidently a problem about the terms under which people appear to one another such that the rendering of that appearance fails not so much because it falsifies the appearance as because that appearance's falseness or inadequacy?its will to appearance rather than appearing?shows problematically through. This means then that it is also not a problem about stereotypes, at least not directly. All of which is to simply underline Greenberg's assertion that the problem is not in the painting: It is in the person, the fact, or notion a society circulates, the access it permits or baffles. Praising Louis's work for its candor counts in this context as praising it for manifesting an appearance not prone to the failings of our own (presentness is grace), able to take its surface seriously, as that from or on which it depends, something that would not be true of us: Our faces?modern, Baudelairean faces?cannot hold their depth to them the way a painting can, and it is a part of what it means that such faces are modern that there are no codes of gesture or allegorical expressiveness that can overcome or hold at bay that unbinding. I am deriving this thought from Greenberg's margins but it is also strongly at work in Harold Rosenberg's cultural criticism. This is why, for example, he turns repeatedly back to Marx's 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon and its version of Baudelaire's question of modern heroism, a version that stresses how far we are condemned to repetition, to showing ourselves only in the outworn costumes of those who have come before. At bottom this belief is founded for both writers on Marxist diagnoses and hopes?the thought that the human has yet to happen but that we might find our revolutionary way there still. The faith runs deeper in Rosenberg than it does in Greenberg, both for the future and in their present, so Rosenberg was able to imagine that in the painting of Pollock or Rothko or Newman we get something like clothing of their own design, not costume but genuine or authentic expression, as near to human self-showing as we can come. The inner threat is, of course, that this, too, will prove mere fashion, a new repetition in which to dress ourselves and so give those selves away, and so Rosenberg is drawn to Pop Art both because it is iconoclastic in the right way, refusing old clothing, even abstract, for the self, and because it makes an explicit issue of the repetitions to which we are given over, tying these repetitions to the order in which inadequate notions of the human personality are circulated. This may leave him with his political faith intact but risks putting art's standards out of reach, whereas Greenberg might be said to let the political faith go in order to save the standards. This makes the positions a little more symmetrical than they actually are: Rosenberg dreams of the day when the dead will have buried the dead and the living will wear only the clothing of the present while Greenberg's day is more nearly the one in which we are all equipped for difficulty. Rosenberg's day will come when we all, finally, share a human face; Greenberg's when we are willing to face one another. A question one might ask of each is whether, come that day, we will have any need of art and what that need might be. I suspect that Rosenberg would have to say we would have no such need, that what we now call art?the activities of making paintings and sculptures and the</page><page sequence="13">Melville: Betty's turn 43 like?will once again become simply continuous with the living of our lives; and I suspect that Greenberg would want to resist saying that because in some sense art for him is tangled up with maintaining what I have just posited as a willingness to face one another (it is neither possible nor desirable to return to a situation in which these things were just the means of our direct and fully mutual recognition). 5. Some cameras The last two bits?the attempt at renewing Fried's description of Minimalism and its consequences and the loose imagining of the stakes in modern portraiture?can, I hope, count as the creation of a double context in which perhaps the most striking feature of much contemporary portraiture?which is the strong presence (sometimes direct and sometimes mediated) of photography?can find its complex place. The camera has, of course, been available as a means of portraiture for a long time now. For the most part it has Until recently done that job straight, but sometimes also in expressively bent ways, without fundamentally disturbing the practice of portraiture itself. The camera's very success at representation has often seemed to condemn it to be unable to raise any questions about representation; those photographers who have wanted something more of their practice tended to show what the camera and its subjacent technologies could do beyond automatically represent what it found in front of it?as if doing that was both clear enough and not open to any deep questioning. Here's a story about the vicissitudes of the camera: When first picked up, the camera is an irreducibly realist tool, offering or threatening to set a standard for visual representation. We learn to recognize ourselves in it. We imagine it capable of putting an end to other practices, such as painting, or capable of driving them to abstraction. At a second glance, the camera strikes us as an image duplicator, as the very paradigm of representation's theft of presence, and in this way continuous with a larger cultural logic of repetition and reproduction. The recognitions it once offered turn out to have been misrecognitions, thefts, or impositions. Pop Art picks this camera up along this way, and Rosenberg understands its doing so?as does Benjamin Buchloh, who, in an essay on recent portraiture, asks a question in some ways quite close to my own. As he puts it: "Why did the literal disappearance of the sitter from the surface of the painting appear to be a pictorial necessity as much as an epistemic condition in the conception of subjectivity?"22 His answer, hinged to a view of Warhol and Lichtenstein and appealing to the problematic status of representation and its critique more or less as I have sketched it, is: "Spectacular subjectivity in late-capitalist consumer society is measured according to the degree of acquired visibility and public exposure." This leads him to be suspicious of any portraiture?he instances Thomas Struth and Thomas Ruff?that claims to move beyond the implicitly critical Pop Art equation of the representation of subjectivity with commodity exchange. A third camera emerges out of the Minimalist cube as an explication of its internal logic of self and other. In many ways, the things it shows connect well with what Pop Art knows, but it is also different at least insofar as the camera itself?now perhaps best described as a machine for generating automatic perspective renditions of the world, or, more loosely, as a renderer of objects for a subject?seems in its very mechanism to engage the positional logic of the Minimalist cube, embracing its situation of subject and object, self and mirror, presence and absence bound and divided, taking one another's turn. This camera is most at home in the hands of conceptualists, and Adrian Piper is perhaps an especially apt example here. But in thus reinscribing the fact of reduplication within the field of positionality it discovers within itself another possibility?that its work is neither realist nor simply reproductive nor blankly positional but a matter of displacement. Robert Smithson sees this, I think, first and most clearly?remaking Minimalist repetition as shift and displacement and discovering this as a mirror's work as well; documenting this, he brings it home in and to the camera; Richter's camera is, in the end, a version of this, its realism an effect of the world.23 The realism of this camera is that it knows this work does not begin with it, that it is in some way the world's work: that what the world does is show, giving itself over to representation. This is to imagine that the world opens itself toward us, that it has gaps within itself, separates from itself in or as its appearing to us, figures itself in the continuous displacements of its appearing, and is in all these ways impressive, impressing us, like light on a photographic surface. Svetlana Alpers thinks that something like this is the faith of Dutch painting and that 22. Benjamin Buchloh, "Residual Resemblance: Three Notes on the Ends of Portraiture/' in Feldman (ibid.), p. 54. 23. Rosalind Krauss has picked out a similar dynamic in surrealist photography insofar as it discovers the ceaseless writing of the world. See Krauss, "Photography in the Service of Surrealism," in Rosalind Krauss and Jane Livingstone, L'amourfou: Photography and Surrealism (New York: Abbeville Press, 1985).</page><page sequence="14">44 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 it informs Las Meninas in fundamental ways as well?so she speaks of the "surface onto which an image casts itself" as against the window or perspective grid through which a world is ordered into representation. She also insists on the way in which within this faith the world is conceived as prior to the artist-viewer who is not, then, its creator, and imagines painting in this mode as a work of impression. Her language here overlaps suggestively with Fried's description of the way Stella's canvases "stamp themselves out" as shape.24 All of this, I believe, belongs to the cameras both Cindy Sherman and Richter pick up along their different ways. For Sherman this has meant, at least in her early work, the recognition that representation is not simply imposed but is also the way one has one's self in the first place. What has been hardest for many of her interpreters to accept is just that these photographs are, in every sense, of Sherman; she is in them and they cannot be read simply as stereotypes from which she retreats or withholds her self. And this means that the second hardest thing to accept is that they do not constitute a parade of simulacra wholly empty of self. They are, in this sense, sites neither simply of recognition nor misrecognition but of the absolute enfoldedness of the one within the other, and they work to acknowledge the necessity of such enfolding. Candor is probably not the word we will want here. I am not sure what is; it is a matter of making peace of a sort with masquerade, of acknowledging how custom is our nature. For Richter this may mean that the enjoined realism of the camera ultimately rejoins the gratuitousness of painting, which would be why each can count in some measure as a standard for the other (Richter's writings and conversation return to this knot again and again). "Candor" continues, I think, to be a good word for what his painting achieves, although unlike Louis's more straightforward delight in the showing of painting, Richter's candor takes irony to be one of the inevitable dimensions of the world's showing of itself. Likewise, it can take on, in a way Louis's painting cannot, the association of such candor with the ordinary contingency of the candid in its beauty, banality, and endlessness. As with Sherman, there is renunciation here, now played out across the dividedness of his mediums and styles. In 1988, preparing for a press conference on his Baader Meinhof series, Richter writes: "My motivation counts for nothing, as far as the pictures are concerned: they are independent of it, because they are themselves pieces of reality/'25 6. October 18, 1977 One recent commentator on Richter's portraiture suggests that "in visual terms, there is nothing about Betty to suggest that it should be understood as a counterpart to the picture of Ulrike Meinhof" in Richter's October 18, 1977, cycle, despite their being painted at virtually the same time.26 But this remark seems peculiarly empty given that whatever one imagines as the "units" of Richter's painting, they clearly are not based on visual resemblance, and that these two unquestionable masterpieces were created in the space of a few months in 1988. Any attempt to map the thought that binds Betty and the October paintings to one another will likely have to begin with their most marked contrasts?grisaille/ color, domestic/public, single/multiple, life/death, and so on?all the terms of their visual dissemblance. But these will not be instructive until they can show their sense as terms of a larger practice. How might one begin to get at that? Here's one thought: A prominent feature of the October paintings is repetition. It is there in the choice of photographs even in advance of the decision to make paintings of them; it is there in the sequence of paintings themselves; and it is emphatically there in Richter's own summary of the cycle: What have I painted. Three times Baader shot. Three times Ensslin hanged. Three times the head of the dead Meinhof after they cut her down. Once the dead Meins. Three times Ensslin, neutral (almost like pop stars). The a big, unspecific burial?a cell dominated by a bookcase?a silent, grey record player?a youthful portrait of Meinhof?twice the arrest of Meins, forced to surrender to the clenched power of the state.27 It's almost there in the not-quite-paired cells, and oddly there and not there in itself in the catalogue raisonne's pairing of the Meinhof Youth Portrait and Record Player, the latter an object oddly salient both within the events depicted and in terms of this thread of reproduction and repetition. Is it there as well in the 24. See Michael Fried, "Shape as Form/' in his Art and Objecthood: Essays and Reviews (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998). 25.

If these things do seem to belong together, then we will be prepared to accept that Richter's recurrent interest in the interplay of a certain kind of shallow represented space?one in which shadow plays an important role and in which the ground tends to drift toward the condition or form or representation of Richter's grey monochromes?is part and parcel of his larger interest in repetition, and that these interests are connected in turn to a larger interest, evident one way in Richter's mirrors and another way in the nonnarrative structure of the October 18, 1977, cycle itself, in the space across which a painting shows itself in relation to another (much of this appears summarized in the sculptural piece called Double Glass Section, which puts both sides of his monochrome mirrors in play against one another and against?or in relation to?whatever work surrounds it). The argument would then be that for Richter repetition discovers a space that is in some sense specific to painting, but that also shows up in it as a sort of discovery of photography or the photographic surface. While it is not particularly strange as a rendering of space (it does not claim the kind of novelty that perspective did in its moment or that a range of European and American modernisms laid claim to in theirs), it is peculiar in its relation to exteriority, as if turning the reserve of inwardness Hegel situated on the unreachable far side of the painting's surface (and that Minimalism then placed at the center of its cubes)?as if turning that reserve back into the surface itself, the very stuff of its exposure. The surface is then everywhere caught up in the repetitive business of showing itself, and doing so in ways that carry pretty much all the complexity that comes with trying to imagine what it is that our faces do and do not show, the kinds of capacity we can and cannot imagine ourselves to have either to show them or to be responsible for their showing. It is this internal repetition that necessarily spills over in the decentered mutual facing that holds the October cycle together as a whole and that, differently, binds that cycle to Betty, which in turn gathers that cycle's resources back into a single painting. If Richter's summary of the October cycle emphasizes the repetition internal to it, it also makes notably strong use of proper names?"Three times Baader. . . . Three times Ensslin. . . . Three times . . . Meinhof. . . . Once. . . . Meins. Three times Ensslin. . . . Meinhof?twice . . . Meins. . . ."?and it seems right to connect this way of describing the work with his remark that "knowledge about individual people was the foundation of the pictures." I asked at the outset, "What is this portrait of someone evidently not facing us, not facing the painter? Why don't we take it as refusing or denying us something?" It seems to me that we are now perhaps in a position to see that our not taking it that way is the mark of Richter's successful defeat of Minimalism. And it is genuinely a defeat and not a refusal: It takes on the question of the individual as Minimalism reshapes it and finds within that question resources for answering it otherwise, turning individuality away from inwardness toward the singularity of its exteriority, its "ex-timacy," in Jean-Luc Nancy's coinage, opening a world in which the temptation to skepticism and the facts of care or compassion are not at odds with one another. 7. Betty Leo Steinberg picks out three registers in Las Meninas: "The painter gives us the real, the reflected, and the depicted as three interdependent states, three modalities of the visible that cause and succeed one another in a perpetual round." This seems to me about right. But then he turns this toward the viewer as if the viewer remained undivided by it and says that: ... the picture conducts itself the way any vital presence behaves. It creates an encounter. And as in any living encounter, any vital exchange, the work of art becomes the alternate pole in a situation of reciprocal self-recognition. If the picture were speaking instead of flashing, it would be saying: I see you seeing me?I in you see myself seen?see you seeing yourself being seen?and so on beyond the reaches of grammar. Confronted mirrors we are, polarized selves, reflecting one another's consciousness without end; partaking of an infinity that is not spatial but psychological?an infinity not cast in the outer world, but in the mind that knows and knows itself known. The mirror within Las Meninas is merely its central emblem, a sign for the whole. Las Meninas in its entirety is a metaphor, a mirror of consciousness.29 This is, as always with Steinberg, wonderful writing. However, it gives in far too easily to the desire on which the painting clearly plays and on which it partly 28. See sheets 470-479?471 is especially notable?in Gerhard Richter, Atlas, ed.

Were the painting indeed Steinberg's mirror of consciousness, it would not have been a painting, and so Steinberg's conclusions strike me as almost word by word exactly wrong. I think of Betty as helping to show all this, and so as perhaps helping one hear the beat of wrongness passing through Steinberg's words. What Betty turning, faces is and remains as opaque, expressive, and discrete as the turn of her neck, and what the painting of her offers us is a vision?an admission?of our separation and exposure that very precisely refuses the perils and prospects of the mirror, the consciousnesses and self-consciousnesses it so easily emblematizes, which is perhaps one way of saying what Greenberg's abstraction, faced with the unrepresentability (the mere representability?) of the human, could not do. 8. Angles of Vision Did you see him there?just off to the side, between two of the columns, almost flats that would make of the room something like a proscenium theater? At least I think that's him, although he's not looking very much himself. Standing that way he looks a little (just enough) like Velazquez behind his canvas, but he is not painting (he saved that for the picture of the royal family with its seamless and invisible mirror). On the back wall there is something that looks like an immense Stella (almost as big as the painting itself is in reality); it is not that, of course, but Stella, we are told, always did want to paint like Velazquez. Licht's account suggests that standing there he is just about to merge with or vanish into the vast, blank, and indifferent background of the prints or the deep underlying blackness of the paintings at the Quinta del Sordo. He poses this well, as a matter of modern light, but it seems also a version of what Lacan famously calls "the gaze." He's been there all along.</page></plain_text>
