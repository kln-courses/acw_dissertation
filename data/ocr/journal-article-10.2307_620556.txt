<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM MONTGOMERY WATT: Early Islam: collected articles. xi, 207 pp. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1990. ?25. Twenty-three articles, covering the Qur'an, Muhammad and early Islamic theology, are brought together here in one fairly cohesive volume, representing studies published by Watt between 1943 and 1983. All the articles have been edited with a view to a consistent transliteration and all the footnotes have been put into one overall series; no attempt has been made to update any of the material, however. In the first section, consisting of 11 articles on Muhammad and the Qur'an, two themes which predominate in much of Watt's writing are in evidence. One, clearly stated in chapters such as 'His name is Ahmad' (1953) and 'The Christianity criticized in the Qur'in' (1967), is that there are no barriers to Muslim-Christian mutual understanding and tolerance when Islamic history and its sources are assessed fairly and in light of the historical-critical method. Two, an understanding of history is a valuable, even essential goal in itself and the truth behind it is not all that difficult to attain. This sentiment appears most clearly in 'The reliability of Ibn Ishiq's sources' (1983), which, as far as I have been able to determine, is Watt's one attempt to grapple with more recent approaches to Islamic history. His fundamental point can stand repeating: '... it is worth reminding ourselves of a general principle of all historical research, namely, that the ostensible sources for any series of events are always to be accepted unless some grounds can be shown for their rejection or partial rejection' (pp. 13-4). With such a view of writing history, Watt has not moved very far from the perspective with</page><page sequence="2">196 SHORT NOTICES which the Muslim historians of the eighth and ninth centuries (the 'scholar' Ibn Is1hq, for example) wrote their own chronicles: it is simply a matter of retelling 'what really happened-', filtered, of course, through our own contempor- ary sense of' what makes sense'. Despite what I would consider an inadequate view of the task at hand, these articles of Watt may, in no way, be simply dismissed. They include a number of valuable if unexciting con- tributions. The article 'The dating of the Qur'an: a review of Richard Bell's theories' (1957) is an excellent overview of the principles behind Bell's work in his Qur'dn translation and raises all sorts of interesting problems regarding analysis of the scriptural text. The previously mentioned 'His name is Ahmad' brings together the evidence that, prior to about 125 A.H., Ahmad was not used as a Muslim name and the Qur'anic reference in sira 61, verse 6, was previously taken as an adjective rather than a proper name. Other articles in this section include items on Banfi Qurayza, conver- sion to Islam, and the concept of khalTfa, as well as treatments of various Qur'dnic passages (Q. 7:40;85:4-7;93). The second section of the book brings together 12 articles, including several from rather obscure sources. The themes of the first section of the book continue, especially in the first three articles which are reprinted from the hard-to-find (at least in more distant places) Transactions of the Glasgow University Oriental Society. Included are articles on tahrif, bi-ld kayf and anthropomorphism, and the status in Islam of the idea of humans being created 'in the image of God '. Other studies in this section focus on epistemology in theology, the doctrine of acquisition, the Kharijites, Shi'ism, and heresiographers and their subjects. There can be no doubt about William Mont- gomery Watt's contribution to our field of study. Many of us remember very well the role Watt's writings played in our post-graduate years and it would be churlish not to acknowledge the debt which we owe to this scholar. His works will continue to be significant, will continue to be studied, and, indeed, continue to be refuted wherever necessary. This collection of articles is a fitting reminder of the contribution he has made. A. RIPPIN</page></plain_text>
