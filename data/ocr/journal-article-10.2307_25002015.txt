<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCIENT SUMER AND THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT: The Process of Reaching Behind, Encompassing and Going Beyond Mary K. Wakeman The strokes are broad with which I will attempt to paint a picture placing the present-day women's movement in the context of the evolution of West ern culture since the beginnings of cities in ancient Sumer. At the same time, the point of view is narrow, in that I speak as a white, middle-class, Protestant, American woman who is now reevaluating the elite, white, male, Western tradition in which she was educated. For me, as for many others, the women's movement has been a religious movement. It has served as a conversion experience, a turning around, as "the pieces of my life have fallen together in a new way."' In liberating us from old roles, the movement caught us up in the profoundly disturbing experience of suddenly becoming personally accountable in a way we had not known before. We were abruptly torn out of mythic being and tossed into historic being: from experiencing ourselves secondhand, through internalized, man-made images of women, we were called to realize ourselves as culture-making, history-making, per sons-in-charge. We sought out other women to "hear one another into speech,"2 and in the process, to found a world on values that would better meet the challenges of our present human circumstances than the ones tradition had taught us. Feminist scholars are taking a serious interest in ancient Sumer as the birthplace of cities and of Western civilization. (See map on p. 27.) Some of the impetus for exploring ancient history emerges from a religious need felt by participants in the women's movement for a new myth of origins that will reempower women. Several scholars have explored the evidence for the relation between the worship of goddesses and the political and economic power of women in ancient times.3 The record of ancient Sumer can be read 1 Judith Plaskow, "The Coming of Lilith: Toward a Feminist Theology," in Womanspirit Rising, ed.

They bought and sold land, engaged in trade, and managed estates. There was once a time (so this way of telling the story goes), well within recorded history, when women were regarded as fully the equals of men in their capacity to wield economic, political, religious and military power.4 On the other hand, as I read it, the evidence can be seen stereo scopically, providing a picture of changing relations among gods and god desses, among men and women, and between divinities and humans, that makes ancient Sumer a splendid laboratory for studying the evolution of a patriarchal social order. Other feminist scholars have noted the increasing limitation on women's independent exercise of power, as Sumerian civilization developed.5 In my discussion of Sumerian history I will focus on the changing definitions of political power and how those were sanctioned in religious terms. In doing so I will take issue with those who find in the Sumerian goddess Inanna a feminist goddess or role model.6 I will argue that the religious ideas associ ated with this goddess were adapted at each new stage of Sumer's history to support the emergence of patriarchal structures of authority. As I investigate this question I find that Inanna points forward to the acceptance of historical process as real, of human initiative as sacred. She also points backward insofar as she remained important in the ancient Sumerian world of in creasingly male gods and human leaders because she conserved the values of a time when power was female and communal, when the processes of life, fertility and death were respected, when the fruitful integration of the powers of heaven and earth was celebrated. The various assessments of Inanna's significance may reflect differences in ideological orientation within the women's movement. Some of the cur rent interest in ancient Sumer is an expression of the explosion of interest in ancient and other goddesses that is informed by what I call "the myth of patriarchy." The myth of patriarchy is a story of how contemporary social and political problems result from mismanagement by men, who deliberately and violently wrested control of human affairs from the women in whose hands those affairs were more competently managed.7 The story has a very important function in justifying female anger and encouraging female ini tiative. It is useful for exorcizing the negative self-images that have been left by "the myth of matriarchy." The myth of matriarchy is a story of how women once ruled but then lost their authority, either through their own fault (e.g., Eve in the Bible), or, again, because it was wrested from them by men. Historically, the world religions (Buddhist, Islamic, Hindu, Jewish, Chris 4 Ochshorn, The Female Experience. 5 Boulding, The Underside of History; Rohrlich, "State formation in Sumer." 6 Sylvia Perera, Descent to the Goddess: A Way of Initiation for Women (Toronto, Canada: Inner City Books, 1981); Diane Wolkstein and Samuel Noah Kramer, Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1983). 7 Elizabeth Gould Davis, The First Sex (New York: Putnam, 1971); Merlin Stone, When God was a Woman (New York: Dial Press, 1976).</page><page sequence="3">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 9 tian) developed at a time when male dominance in political and social life had been firmly established. These religions served as charters authorizing the patriarchal order, justifying it by one form or another of the myth of ma triarchy. At the same time they preserved visions of the value of persons, the "person" was assumed to be male. Women were represented as men experi enced them, associated with sex and death, nature and mortality, with forces that men feared, and sought to control. In traditional societies the myth of matriarchy is told to a young boy at puberty, during the rite that initiates him into manhood.8 The story helps the boy make sense of his experience when he passes out of a household dominated by women and takes up his role as an adult man among men. His new authority over women is thus legitimated. As women hear the story, it serves to "inculcate in them a sense of moral failure."9 Presumably, the myth of patriarchy, if men took it seriously, would have a similarly deleterious effect on their self-esteem. In my view, men and women have always been and will continue to be interdependent. My impulse to give an account of Sumer as a model of a society in transition may be a response to the religious need for a myth of origins, but the story need not be either the myth of matriarchy or the myth of patriarchy. It is possible to talk about how patriarchy began without blaming either women or men. Part of the fascination Sumer holds is the possibility of an end inherent in a beginning. As we look to Sumer for the origins of private property, slavery, capitalism, militarism, and the pa triarchal family, we are also made aware of alternative possibilities. Perhaps we are not so different from the ancient Sumerians in our need to understand the new in terms of the old. In ancient Sumer, as we will see, religious sanctions were provided for each new stage in the development of political power by reaching behind, encompassing, and going beyond the previous stage. The ethic emerging in the women's movement today can be described as the result of our reaching behind the biblical, monotheistic world view to affirm bodily and social processes, natural and cultural diversity. In so doing, we encompass the intervening achievement of male-dominated Western civilization (acknowledging how we have been shaped and misshaped by it) and go beyond to new possibilities-taking charge of ourselves and of this small garden we inhabit and share with other species. Changing Definitions of Political Power: How These Were Sanctioned in Religious Terms Among the earliest evidence of religious activity in the ancient Near East are female figurines expressing fertility. They testify to a time when the power of fertility was associated with the female; the role of the male in 8 Joan Bamberger, "The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society," in Woman, Culture and Society, ed.

(It stands to reason that until people began domesticating animals, or at least living with enough agricultural abundance that women could menstruate regularly, the connection between sexual intercourse and birth was not obvious.) These figurines are not necessarily goddesses, but they symbolize awe before female procreative powers, and represent an attempt to relate to and appropriate those powers. With the discovery of the male role in procreation, the power of fertility was expressed through male divinities as well. Many of the earliest temple communities of ancient Sumer belonged to male gods associated with the power of fertility in underground water (Enki), in the moon (Nanna), in the sun (Utu), in the sky that brought the round of seasons (An), in spring storms that brought the water flooding down from the mountains (Ningirsu). If their gods were male it did not necessarily follow that human authority in the early temple communities was assumed exclusively by males. Temples housed goddesses as well as gods; women as well as men were managers of temple estates.10 The fact that the prefix "Nin" occurs in masculine as well as feminine god names is suggestive. This prefix, usually translated "Lady," or better, "Queen," is written with signs that connote authority. Perhaps the connotation of authority that had more naturally belonged to the female (as mother) came secondarily to be appropriate for male figures as well. The development of city culture was supported by a religious cult that superimposed on the prehistoric mother goddesses associated with herding and farming at the village level an increasingly elaborate system of deities. While farmers were concerned with fertility in fields and flocks, the urban managers were concerned, in addition, with sanctioning innovations in management. Anthropomorphic divinities lent themselves to the expression of changing power relations among human groups, as family relations were worked out among gods and goddesses. Two Paradigms of Change At the very beginning of Sumer's history (c. 3500 B.C.E.) its two most ancient cities, Eridu and Uruk, provided two types of religious sanctions of political power. These served as paradigms for every subsequent stage in Sumer's development. Uruk's doctrine of a marriage between heaven and earth, reflecting the experience of a pastoral group, supplied the formative element in the development of a systematic pantheon in ancient Sumer. 1 All of the gods were descended from Uruk's god An (whose name means "sky") and his wife Ki ("earth"). Uruk's goddess Inanna, the bright star (Venus), sister of Utu, the sun, (both children of Nanna, the moon), is one of the 10 Thorkild Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), p. 81. u J.

Enki, god of fresh ground waters and god of the city of Eridu, was the product (son) of a syncretistic union between Uruk's sky god (An), and Eridu's (chthonic) Nammu. The Eridu paradigm. The earliest concept of power supporting the complex order of the city-state through its central temple was expressed in the masculine cult of Enki, which celebrated the phallic force of fertility. Sumerian myths of origins in which Enki played a prominent role preserve the historical memory of Eridu's preeminence.13 They also provide an image of a nonmilitary mode of male power. Before there were storm gods cele brated for their association with the thundering chariots of war, there were male deities who took over the functions of the mother goddesses, expressing the power of fertility in the waters that fell from the sky and welled up from under the earth, to fructify it. In the course of Sumerian history and reflecting the development of patriarchy, Enki (as he is portrayed in myth, e.g., "the creation of man")l4 came to incorporate the other powers of his mother, giving form and giving birth. By about 2000 B.C.E. the name of the mother goddess in the god lists had been completely replaced by that of Enki.15 The Uruk paradigm. There is a story about how Inanna, goddess of Uruk, traveled to Eridu and tricked Enki into giving her the powers of office.16 At the same time as it acknowledges the priority of Enki, and his city, Eridu, this story may be a way of accounting for the fact that, very early, Uruk took over from Eridu the role of dominant city in southern Sumer. In Eridu's rival city, Uruk, there was an alternative way of expressing male authority under the power of a female deity.

Sacred Marriage: The Union of Heaven and Earth As far back as anything is known about Uruk, there is a tradition of Inanna and Uruk's ruler living together in the gipar (a quarter of the temple), as husband and wife. From the beginning of Uruk's history we see evidence of a harvest rite of celebration that took the form of a marriage between a god, Dumuzi, the power inherent in seasonal foods (grain, milk, dates) and the goddess Inanna, in whose house, the temple, the foods were to be stored. We may assume that this goddess symbolized the power of the community to provide for itself. The evidence of the Sacred Marriage that we have from this time is a vase, decorated with a design showing a procession of people bearing baskets of dates, grain, or wool, and leading livestock to the door of the temple where the goddess sits to receive them. In the ordinary marriage custom of the Sumerians the groom came bearing gifts of food to the home of the bride. If the family accepted him, and when the bride was ready, she would open the door. That simple gesture concluded the marriage and the next morning, after the marriage was consummated, a great feast would be provided to entertain the wedding guests. Here, the ritual pictured on the vase, the gathering of produce at the temple to store it for later distribution to the people, was apparently experienced as a kind of marriage. The produce was the god (represented by the en, the manager of the goddess's estate), entering into or being received by the goddess, the storehouse (represented by a priestess). So the two ways for a man to claim authority in the earliest temple communities were as the trusted servant, or as the husband of the divinity whose estate he managed. Sumer grew by the northward extension of intensive agricultural use of land, and by the political hegemony of one city over its surrounding territo ries. As Sumer developed, differences in wealth and resources among the temple communities and between them and the unsettled countryside re sulted in more and more frequent raids, calling for a leader in defense. Over the course of a thousand years, kingship developed as an institution, the king being at first a commander in battle, then an adjudicator of boundary and other disputes. As communities grew, they impinged on one another. Quar rels over water rights and access to other resources developed. Eventually magic and ritual duties were added to military and judicial ones, and the king took on some priestly roles. At a certain point, the king himself came to be worshipped for the power of the center that he provided. The king was sacred as a symbol of unity; he served to bring together diverse groups of people, each of which had started out as a temple community, with its own god or goddess symbolizing the power inherent in that community. It is important to notice here the distinction between the relatively small</page><page sequence="7">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 13 and homogeneous temple community that worked largely by consensus, and the sacred power that inhered in the very notion of a central figure who could coordinate the activities of groups of people with interests that might other wise be pulling against each other. For the power of the spirit in the community was substituted worship of authority at its center. What began as a temporary conferring of authority on one man who then had the power to command an army to preserve the community against attack, became a sacred institution, as such emergencies became a chronic condition. The origins of male dominated hierarchy, or patriarchy, are re flected in the changed significance of the Sacred Marriage ceremony at the beginning and the end of Sumer's history. In the beginning it was a harvest celebration when produce was brought into the temple to be stored. At the end of Sumer's history, c. 2000 B.C.E., the Sacred Marriage was still performed, but now it was the king of all Sumer who was the god Dumuzi incarnate. The goddess Inanna comes to him not as the spirit of the com munity, but as a representative of the whole pantheon of gods, who have conferred authority upon the king. Their marriage still recreates and cele brates a harmonious relationship between the human and the divine or natural worlds. The goddess associated with creativity in nature as well as culture and the king responsible for the safety and material welfare of his people express mutual attraction and dependence on one another. But the ceremony also expresses the elevated status of a king who is in effect a god, with the authority to take initiative in manipulating the natural and human environments for greater productivity and security. The palace had, in effect, become the temple, as power-over rather than mutual enpowerment was worshipped. There had been a shift three ways: the center of power in the community was the palace rather than the temple, a human being rather than a god, male rather than female. The role of the religious functionaries shifted from serving the people (the manager of the temple estate) to serving the king/warrior elite. Religion validated the structures of power-over rather than empowering the community as a whole, and all this under the aegis of Inanna! How did this come about? Shifts in Power During the period of about 3500-2000 B.C.E. one can observe the development of power: of sheer numbers of people brought under one rule, as the effective political center of Sumer moved upriver from city to city (south to north) in consecutive waves of consolidation and disintegration. In what follows, I will refer to three stages of Sumer's historical development. During the Early Dynastic (ED) period, c. 2900-2350 B.C.E. important centers at Nippur in the north, Lagash to the east and Ur in the south experimented with a variety of ways of sanctioning male authority based on the two original paradigms. Next, the Akkadian empire (2300-2150) founded</page><page sequence="8">14 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion by Sargon of Agade brought Inanna to international prominence as the tutelary goddess of all Sumer and Akkad. Later, during the Sumerian Renais sance (c. 2100-1800) when the third dynasty of Ur and then the kingdoms of Isin and Larsa dominated all Sumer and brought Sumerian culture to its fullest expression, kings became gods through marriage with the goddess. The process by which power shifted from the temple to the palace, from gods to human beings, from female to male, can be seen in these developments. In Sumerian tradition,17 Eridu, the southernmost city of Sumer, was the first of five cities to hold kingship over the land before "the flood." As noted above, Eridu was superceded in importance by Uruk (upriver and to the west). The "urban revolution," first evident at Uruk at the end of the fourth millennium, involved not so much an increase, as a redistribution of popula tion, concentrating in urban centers, decimating the countryside.18 City culture was characterized by greater population density, more intensive use of land, and differential access to wealth. The appearance of writing testifies to the growing complexity of commerce and administration. Kin-based or ganization yielded to social stratification. An almost complete cultural break, referred to as "the flood," occurred, as a result of the influx of Semitic speaking people from the north and northwest.'9 After "the flood," Sumer extended from Eridu in the south to the Semitic city of Kish in the north. The Early Dynastic Period: Power Shifts from Temple to Palace During Early Dynastic times (2900-2350 B.C.E.), the concept of the nation, Sumer, developed. The term "Early Dynastic" refers to the plethora of dynasties in Sumer as reflected in the Sumerian King List. The title "king of Kish" was assumed by various city chiefs who claimed that their authority to rule the whole area of Sumer was given them by the god Enlil, the executor of the will of the assembled gods of Sumer.20 Enlil, whose name ("Lord Wind") expresses his expansive character, was beloved by farmers, for whom he invented the hoe. His temple in Nippur was the chief shrine of the 17 Thorkild Jacobsen, "The Sumerian King List," Assyriological Studies 11 (Chicago, 1939), p. 70ff. 18 Robert M.

As power shifted from the temple community as a whole, represented by its god or goddess, to the king as the center of initiative, coordinating the activities of several such communities, An came to represent the consensus reached by the assembly of the gods, and Enlil the power to carry out its will.</page><page sequence="9">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 15 land to which pilgrimages were made from cities of the "Kengir League."2' City walls appeared, testifying to the increased incidence of war. During ED II the shift in power from temple to palace resulting from increased military activity gave Enlil prestige in Sumer as the god who authorized kings, and lessened the possibility of power for women.22 The Uruk system in which the ruler was chosen by Inanna conflicted with the dynastic principle which took hold in the north.23 Uruk's power was on the wane during the Early Dynastic period as military activity increased. Not mentioned in the Sumerian King List are the ensis ("officials in charge of ploughed lands" or governors) of Lagash, a territory north and east of Uruk. For 150 years before and fifty years after Sargon's empire, Lagash and its royal city Girsu (belonging to the god Ninurta, known locally as Ningirsu), dominated Sumer. Royal inscriptions from Lagash and records from a temple in Girsu inform us about its rulers. Mesalim, "king of Kish," settled a boundary dispute between the cities of Lagash and Umma in the territory of Lagash sometime during ED II. Ur-Nanshe established a dynasty c. 2520 which lasted for five generations. His grandson Eannatum conquered Elam, Umma, Ur and Uruk. The evidence from Lagash shows that the ensis authorize their claims to rule with reference to Ningirsu, to several goddesses who have temples in the area, and to Enki, Inanna and Enlil as gods of Sumer.24 It is possible that Ningirsu, the power in spring storms originally represented by a lion-headed bird, was understood to be incarnate in the ensi as he celebrated the Sacred Marriage with Bau, city goddess of Lagash.25 Uru-inim-gina (formerly known as Urukagina)26 reestablished Ningirsu and his consort Bau as the 21 Jacobsen, "Early Political Development in Mesopotamia," Toward the Image of Tam muz, p. 140ff. 22 Boulding, The Underside of History, p. 192. 23 This conflict is illustrated in the epic tales (from Old Babylonian times) which reflect the culture of the heroic age of Uruk (ED II). In the Sumerian story of Lugalbanda, Inanna "looked at [Lugalbanda] as if he were Dumuzi" (her husband, in myth), thus choosing him over the son of the contemporary ruler, Enmerkar. In the Akkadian epic, Gilgamesh rejects Ishtar, refusing to take her as his wife. Dynastic rule was in fact instituted when Gilgamesh's son, Urnungal, succeeded him (King List). It is true that Enlil chose the "king of Kish," but this was a matter of authorizing the leadership of a particular city (within which the dynastic principle was normal, for instance, I Lagash) over Sumer as a whole. 24 E.g., Mesalim "beloved of Ninhursag;" Eannatum "whose name was called to mind by Enlil; endowed with strength by Ningirsu; envisaged by Nanshe in her heart; truly and rightly suckled by Ninhursaga; named by Inanna;" "Inanna, because she loved him, gave [Eannatum] the kingship of Kish;" or Entemena "endowed with the scepter by Enlil, endowed with intelligence by Enki, envisaged in the heart of Nanshe, great governor of Ningirsu" etc. Samuel Noah Kramer, The Sumerians (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1963), p. 309ff. 25 Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1948), p. 297. 26 Joan Oates, Babylon (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1979), p. 45.</page><page sequence="10">16 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion owners of the temple lands in Lagash that had been confiscated by the previous rulers. His motive may have been to justify usurping power from the Ur-Nanshe dynasty. Given the similarity in the relationship between Bau and Ninurta, Inanna and Dumuzi, it is an interesting question how Inanna managed to remain centrally significant to the representation of power, while Ninurta's importance in the Sumerian pantheon clearly outshone Bau's. Stories and graphic representations show close parallels between Inanna and Ninurta as divinities associated with storm and war. By the end of Sumer's history, Ninurta and Inanna-Ishtar are nearly equivalent as symbols of king ship. Uru-inim-gina, "renowned for his social and ethical reforms,"27 issued an edict imposing monogamy on women, thus instituting patrilineal inheri tance. He brought his wife Shashag's property under his control, reducing her status to that of consort.28 Uru-inim-gina was ousted, in turn, by Lugalzagesi (priest of Nisaba, reed goddess of Umma) who, as ruler of both Ur and Uruk, claimed that Enlil had given all lands to him, from the lower sea (Persian Gulf) to the upper sea (Mediterranean).29 The historical tradition of Ur embodied in the King List does not reach back as far as that of Kish and Uruk. Excavations of the royal tombs at Ur, a southern city belonging to the moon god Nanna, show wide differences in wealth, which testify to the progress of social stratification. The title "king of Kish" is claimed by Mesanepada, founder of the first dynasty of Ur c. 2490. Ur had a harbor on the Persian Gulf and presided over the southern sea trade. "Consequently every major kingdom formed in Babylon tried to gain possession of Ur."30 Ilshu, who came from Mari far up the Euphrates river during or before Eannatum's time to lay claim to Sumer, was sufficiently concerned with the cult of Ur to dedicate his daughter Ninmetabarri as the human consort of Nanna.31 We have a record of the names of the women who served as high priestess of Nanna at Ur for over 500 years. "This appointment was a royal prerogative which was exercised through numerous dynastic changes and provided in Sumer a unifying link even in periods of apparent disunity."32 Nanna was the first-born son of Enlil; his wife Ningal ("great lady") was the daughter of Enki's wife Ningikuga ("lady of the pure reed"). Thus from our vantage point we might say that the priestess who represented Ningal at Ur competed with the goddess Inanna at Uruk as the female figure through whom male power was authorized, and complemented Enlil's powers to provide religious sanction for the developing nation. Three ways of authorizing a king. The "joining of lordship and king 27 Kramer, The Sumerians, p. 58. 28 Rohrlich, "State Formation in Sumer," p. 85. 29 Dietz Otto Edzard, "The Early Dynastic Period," The Near East, p. 85. 30 Ibid., p. 69. 31 Jacobsen, "Early Political Development," Toward the Image of Tammuz, p. 152. 32 Oates, Babylon, p. 38.</page><page sequence="11">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 17 ship,"33 the authority of the male ruler in relation to the goddess at Uruk, and in relation to the priestess at Ur, brought together the oldest religious traditions of Sumer as exemplified in the worship of the goddess Inanna and the god Enki. Nanna, like Enki, was associated with male powers of fertility. Like Inanna, he was involved in a Sacred Marriage. Through marriage to the priestess at Ur, Nanna (son of Enlil, "prince of the gods")34 came to serve Enlil as his appointed king. If a man could claim en-ship in relation to Inanna, in relation to the entu (Nanna's priestess), he was Nanna incarnate. His relation to their two cities is important to his claim to rule all Sumer. As the warrior chosen by Enlil he is king; as spouse of Inanna, he is priest; as the young bridegroom of the priestess of Nanna, he is the god who brings fertility to the earth, though this god, like Ninurta, is only a prince in relation to Enlil. A reversal of the roles of the divinity and the human being similar to the reversal of the roles of Nanna and his wife (as compared with those of Dumuzi and Inanna) appar ently took place in Girsu, between Ningirsu and Bau. As I reconstruct how this came about, increasing wealth brought increasing need to defend the community from attack, therefore the ensi attempted to protect the com munity from human as well as natural threats. The justification for his authority came to depend more on his association with the god Ninurta/ Ningirsu than with the goddess Bau, as the character of the god which initially expressed fertility shifted to emphasize his warrior aspect. It is interesting that "among farmers in the north, in Nippur, and in the east, in Girsu, Ninurta tends to displace Nanna as the first born son of Enlil."35 Clearly, Lagash's claims to authority in Sumer rivaled those of Ur-Uruk: reason enough for the nonmention of its ensis in the King List, which derives from Uruk. Sacred Marriage as the rite involving a sexual union on which claims of dynastic succession to rulership could be based may well have had its origins in Ur, as an expression of interdependency between the (Ur) temple and the palace (designated by the priesthood at Nippur). Authority continued to be exemplified in the priesthood of Ur as an intercity institution primarily concerned with economic cooperation, while the priesthood at Nippur vested political authority in the "king of Kish" (whatever his native city) who maintained peace among, and protected or extended the boundaries of a league of cities. In ancient Uruk, the ruler served the goddess: the priest served the temple community. At Ur, the goddess served the king: the priestess served the palace on the assumption that the palace served the whole of Sumer. In the transition from local to national significance, the roles of the divinity and the manager of the divinity's estate were reversed. 33 Jacobsen, "Early Political Development," Toward the Image of Tammuz, p. 152. 34 Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness, p. 7. a3 Ibid., p. 128.</page><page sequence="12">18 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion To sum up, the special relationship of Nippur, Ur and Uruk was that they represented the three traditional ways of authorizing a king that had emerged by the end of the Early Dynastic period. To the title "king of Kish" had been added "lord of Uruk" and "king of Ur." Appointment by Enlil carried with it the notion of wind and water that moves past all boundaries. Enlil was essentially expansive: the warrior. As the spouse of Inanna, the king represented the community as it cooperated with seasonal change to produce bounty. Impersonating Nanna, (or Ninurta), he laid claim to fertility (and the principle of dynastic succession) as a male rather than a female capacity. The Akkadian Empire: Power Shifts from God to Human Lugalzagesi had laid the foundations for the empire that was to be established by his conqueror, Sargon of Akkad. The Akkadian empire lasted a century and a half (2300-2150) and represented an enormous leap in power. With a new capital north of the city of Kish, the empire stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The inclusion of new and diverse popula tions introduced a qualitative change in the nature of the human community that would constitute a political unit. This change was reflected in new religious ideas. When Sargon conquered Lugalzagesi, he continued the dynastic union of Ur and Uruk in his own person, making his daughter Enheduanna, priestess to Nanna at Ur and to An (the sky god) at Uruk. By thus instituting a cultic union of their chief priestly offices he broke the tradition of express ing the condominium of Ur and Uruk as the kingship of Ur and the en-ship of Uruk, which had been established by Lugal-kigennesh-dudud.36 Moreover, it was Inanna (not Nanna or An) whose power was invoked to support Sargon's Semitic empire.37 By identifying her with the warlike Semitic god dess Ishtar, and exalting her as the female counterpart of An, Enheduanna provided Sargon with a religious justification for his rule that appealed to the northern, Semitic villagers who still associated fertility, and therefore power, with femaleness. At the same time, this union revived the most ancient cosmology of southern Sumerian Uruk which derived all life from the mar riage of heaven (An) and earth (Ki, with whom Inanna was identified).38 What were the religious ideas that had developed in association with this goddess that made her such a powerful and effective symbol of Sargon's imperial ambition? Thorkild Jacobsen calls Inanna the goddess of "infinite 36 W W. Hallo and J. J. A. Van Dijk, The Exaltation of Inanna (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1968), p. 9. 37 Inanna is "exalted" as the goddess whose "divine attributes are hers by grace of An, the supreme god, with whom she is thus equated at the expense, not of Enki, but of Nanna." Hallo and Van Dijk, The Exaltation of Inanna, p. 50. 38 Ibid., p. 97.</page><page sequence="13">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 19 variety."39 On the Uruk vase Inanna appears with the horned crown of divinity, receiving a basket of dates. She is associated with herding as the goddess of the evening star, one of the astral deities along with her brother Utu (sun), and father Nanna (moon). A text from early Uruk refers to "a festival on the day the Inanna star sets."40 Linked with An, she is also identified with Antum, the power in rain clouds. Her name may be trans lated "Queen of Heaven." The fact that she is historically capable of mediat ing between agricultural and herding economies41 may have made her an appropriate symbol for expressing the increasing power developing in the human community. The Venus star with which Inanna is associated expresses the concept of inconstancy. It is visible for about eight months in the western evening sky, disappears for a week or two, reappears in the eastern sky again for about eight months, then disappears for almost three months before reappearing once more in the western sky. The story of Inanna's journey to the under world is (among other things) about this phenomenon.42 In the Sumerian account of her journey, it is she who is the dying-rising divinity. Dumuzi (her husband/the king) substitutes for her in the underworld, expressing the impor tance of human mortality to the proper functioning of the universe. In the later, Akkadian version of this tale, all sexual activity was suspended in Inanna's absence. Perhaps her image expressed the fruitfulness of change in the face of egoistic fears. The lady is not by accident goddess of both love (life) and war (death). Marriage and battle are the two perennial means of enlarg ing community. Sex and death are confronted as realities to be dealt with together, as can be shown in innumerable examples from comparative my thology (e.g., Adam and Eve). This theme of confronting death and change arises as a major one in every heroic age, that is, at the dawn of history: of awareness of the significance of (public, male) activity in time. So Inanna's very changeableness, one might say, expresses the dawning of historical (patriarchal) consciousness. As a symbol of change, she expresses an accept ance of historical process as real while her simultaneous appearance in myth and epic as a femme fatale expresses the fears associated with sexuality, change and death. 39 Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness, p. 135. 40 Falkenstein, "The Prehistory and Protohistory of Western Asia," The Near East, p. 47.. 41 Jacobsen, "Mesopotamian Gods and Pantheons," Toward the Image of Tammuz, p. 27. Both Inanna and Nanna are astral in character, which may be significant for the develop ment of Sumer in terms of the reliance of planters on the herders' knowledge of the movements of the heavenly bodies. Though local emphases on herding, fishing, and orchards vary, the overall economy of Sumer depends on grain agriculture. The authority the herders have by virtue of their knowledge of the movements of the heavenly bodies in relation to the seasons may be reflected in the traditional way of representing divinity as crowned with horns. 42 Wolfgang Heimpel, "A Catalog of Near Eastern Deities," Syro-Mesopotamian Studies 4:3 (Malibu: Undena Publications, n.d.).</page><page sequence="14">20 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Sargon ruled as Inanna-Ishtar's servant, as the en had in Uruk, by her choice, but now over all Sumer and Akkad, overriding the claims of the dynasties which had ruled as the elect of Enlil. (Note that it is the king ruling from his palace as servant of the goddess who is in charge of the state, not the priestess of the temples in Ur and Uruk.) Enheduanna's account of her expulsion from her posts at Ur and Uruk and her claim to have been restored by (or even as) Inanna may be a way of expressing the change in role from priestess as servant of a male god, to "goddess" as servant of the king. In other words, for all Enheduanna's fame, her elevation of Inanna as support for Sargon's rule represented a further curtailment of the independent power of women, as power shifted from the divine to the human ruler. When Enheduanna sings of Inanna as An's wife,43 this reflects Sargon's policy of regularizing the position of Inanna to conform to the Ur pattern, thus demoting her, in relation to her consort, from divine to human, from the served to the servant. The Sumerian Renaissance: Power Shifts from Female to Male The "Dynasty of Ishtar" was brought to an end by the Gutians, people from the mountains to the northeast "who destroyed much and built nothing."44 They took hold permanently only in the north, and Sumerian culture again flourished (as now Uruk, then Lagash, then Uruk and Ur together took the lead), especially during the second dynasty of Lagash under Gudea. Gudea came to power in Lagash as the son-in-law of Ur-Bau, presumably by engaging in the rite of Sacred Marriage with Ur-Bau's daugh ter Enanepada, high-priestess of Nanna at Ur. Utuhengal of Uruk expelled the Gutians, and it was his general (and brother) Ur-Nammu, who founded Ur III and ushered in the period of richest cultural flowering before Sumer was brought to an end by the Amorite (or first) dynasty of Babylonia (Ham murabi, 1972). It was during the Ur III and Isin-Larsa periods at the end of Sumer's history (2100-1800) that the rite of Sacred Marriage became the quintessen tial expression of Sumer's religious and political self-understanding. Shulgi claimed to rule Sumer as the son of Ur-Nammu and the Ur priestess.45 We have an account of how Shulgi managed to celebrate the New Year festival, including the marriage with Inanna at Uruk and with the priestess of Nanna at Ur in the same day.46 Eventually the Ur III state fell victim to centrifugal force, and to the Elamites, who destroyed Ur. Having expelled the Elamites, 43 Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness, p. 137; Hallo and Van Dijk, The Exaltation of Inanna, p. 97. 44 Jean Bottero, 'The First Semitic Empire," The Near East, p. 120. 45 Jacobsen, Toward the Image of Tammuz, p. 387 n. 80. 46 Samuel Noah Kramer, From the Poetry of Sumer (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), p. 63.</page><page sequence="15">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 21 the kings of Isin claimed the title "king of Ur" and the authority of Enlil for their city's rule over the whole of Sumer. Iddin-Dagan of Isin was exalted as the incarnation, not of Nanna, but of Dumuzi. It is the relationship between Inanna and Dumuzi that is celebrated in the hymns and songs from this time associated with the Sacred Marriage rite performed at the new year. We have come full circle back to the tradition of ancient Uruk, but in a way that marks the triumph of patriarchy in elevating a man to divine status through mar riage to a goddess while lowering the status of female priestly authority at Ur, through whom that divine status had initially been conferred.47 Iddin-Dagan is applauded as the incarnation of Dumuzi Amaushumgalanna as he goes "with lifted head" to bed down the goddess, in the Hymn to Inanna as the Evening Star.48 Dumuzi was originally the nurturing power in various foods: grain, milk, dates.49 In much of the literature about him, his loss (when those foods were out of season) was mourned by his sister and his mother. Examining sources which refer to the marriage relationship, Jacobsen notes "a shift in emphasis: from the god as source of all blessings, the goddess as receiving; to the goddess as the source, the god as recipient." He concludes that more recent, probably, "is the view of the god as recipient, since that would appear to represent a gradual fading of the divine identity in favor of the human one of the king in whom he was incarnate in the rite."50 Humanity is dependent on the gods, but among humans, the king is a god. Perhaps the reason why Uruk's idea of Sacred Marriage reemerged in Ur III times was because it provided a statement of the order of nature and society that seemed uniquely right to the Sumerians at that time: divine had rank over human, but male had rank over female, so female divine (Inanna) and male human (the king) expressed in their union a perfect integration or balance. In terms of power, this resolution represented a demotion of the goddess, while providing the prerequisite of any claim to authority among Sumerians that it be rooted in female power.51 47 The name of Sargon's grandson, Naram-Sin, is the first to appear on inscriptions with the determinative of divinity. He is depicted wearing the horns of divinity (though only one pair) on his stele. A recently discovered inscription relates how the citizens of Agade, out of respect for his effectiveness as a warrior, appealed to the deities of Sumer to make him their city-god.

The Inanna of the "Herder Wedding Text"52 has completely lost her distinctive character as a rival of Enki when she is identified with the earth, asking "who will plough my vulva?"53 Marriage as a metaphor for the union of equals, as it is used to express the relationship between the community and the gods, the harmonious integration of cultural efforts and natural bounty to produce abundant crops and herds, masked what was essentially a master/slave relationship, authorizing the institution of class domination first, and male dominance in particular. As the king serves the gods by organizing his society for production, so the people serve the king by working the land to the advantage of the managerial class. As the goddess depends on the king coming "with lifted head" to plough her vulva, so the people depend on the tax collectors who come periodically to strip them of their surplus! It is true, up to a point, that production increases with larger-scale management. But "in order to raise armies and supply them with arms and equipment, the rulers found it necessary to infringe on the personal rights of the individual citizen, to tax his wealth and property to the limit, and to appropriate, as well, property belonging to the temple."54 The custom requiring that whoever claims to rule them should travel to the various cities of Sumer to celebrate there according to local tradition, apparently reached a breaking point with Shulgi. From then on, the gods 52 Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness, p. 43ff. 53 Wolkstein and Kramer, Inanna, p. 37. Compare: "An American Indian prophet, Smohalla, chief of the Wanapum tribe, refused to till the ground. He held that it was a sin to mutilate and tear up the earth, mother of all. He said: 'You ask me to plow the ground! Shall I take a knife and tear my mother's bosom? Then when I die she will not take me to her bosom to rest. You ask me to dig for stone! Shall I dig under her skin for her bones? Then when I die, I cannot enter her body to be born again. You ask me to cut grass and make hay and sell it, and be rich like white men! But how dare I cut off my mother's hair'?" (Mircea Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1959), p. 138.) with this portion of the "Herder Wedding Text": The young lady [Inanna] was praising her parts and the elegist was weaving it into a song ... "my hillock land, so (well) watered, my parts, piled up with levees, (well) watered I, being (but) a maiden, who will be their ploughman? . . . And the elegist responds: "Young lady, may the king plough them for you! May the king, Dumuzi, plough them for you!" Inanna replies, "The man of my heart! The ploughman is the man of my heart!" (Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness, p. 45-6.) 54 Kramer, The Sumerians, p. 80.</page><page sequence="17">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 23 (represented by the various temple personnel) came to the king. In the Iddin-Dagan text mentioned above, the marriage is celebrated in a palace (presumably at Isin), and Inanna is referred to as the "lady of the palace." Looking at the role of Sumer's most important female religious functionaries, we may describe a progression from the autonomous power of the priestess of Inanna who chose the en (pre-"flood" Uruk), to its lessening as she was appointed by the ruler to be the human spouse of the god Nanna at Ur (by the end of ED III), until eventually (Ur III and later) she became merely the consort of the human god Dumuzi, incarnate in the king. There had been a time when it was as a human that the male wedded the goddess (the en of Uruk, ED II and earlier). Sargon still claimed authority as the servant of the goddess. The Uruk idea reached its full expression only in the Ur III period when the king became the divine husband of Inanna. Reaching Behind, Encompassing, and Going Beyond We are now in a position to review the changing definitions of political religious power to demonstrate the process of reaching behind. An of Uruk and Enki of Eridu were the primeval alternatives to the prehistoric mother goddesses (whose authority, associated with village culture, lingered longer in the north). They exemplified two nonmilitary modes of male power. Sumer grew northward by the extension of agriculture, by military conquest and trade, and by the political hegemony of Kish as authorized by the priesthood of Enlil at Nippur. What Sargon did in exalting Inanna-Ishtar was to reach behind the Nippur-Kish-Ur definition of power to an earlier one exemplified in ancient Uruk, and to adapt it by identifying Inanna with Ishtar the Semitic goddess of love and war, and by elevating Inanna's status among the Sumerian gods, so as to support the notion of a larger Sumer Akkadian state. If Enlil was an extender of boundaries, Inanna, the "lady of myriad offices,"55 was a mediator of differences. At the local, temple-com munity level, Inanna had the advantage over Enki in remaining female, providing continuity with the most ancient religious traditions. Command ing the allegiance of all Sumer, Enlil renewed the tradition of male power, adding military strength to Enki's technical skill. With the addition of Ishtar's warlike aspect and elevation in cosmic status as An's wife, Inanna became a fitting symbol of Sargon's imperial power. Through their ritual marriage to her, the kings who oversaw the richest flowering of Sumerian culture claimed divine status for themselves. Ancient Sumerian political wisdom culminated in Ur III Sacred Mar riage as a more viable alternative to mother goddesses then Eridu's phallic worship. In Uruk's way of understanding power, the lady Inanna is anything but a mother.56 Under Sargon, Inanna became the principle divinity of the 55 Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness, p. 141. 56 Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">24 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Akkadian empire (leaving Uruk to the father-god, An). She became the means by which the kings of Ur III made their claim to rule Sumer, but as the "lady of the palace," Inanna (the priestess) was essentially the consort of the king, and the goddess became the figure more familiar to us from the Gilgamesh epic, the petulant daughter who had to throw tantrums to get her way with her father, An. The institution of Sacred Marriage culminated the development of di vine authorization of the human community's power to instigate, take ini tiative and dominate its environment. Fear of interfering with nature (female) had been faced by transferring power to a human (male) king. As the one through whom the king became a god, Inanna sanctified human efforts to take charge of and change the environment (both cultural and natural). In the course of the next thousand years, the goddess was repudiated altogether, as new ways of legitimating political power were worked out in religious terms. In the second half of the second millennium the king of Babylon was understood to be the chosen servant of the god Marduk. Two classics from that time indicate once again that the new terms were worked out in reaction to those immediately preceding, and through retrieving a value from a previous phase. "Enuma Elish" is an account of how Marduk was granted "sole right of decree" by the assembly of the gods in order to conquer their enemy and create the cosmos from the goddess's parts. As Jacobsen interprets this Babylonian creation story, the rebellious Tiamat ("sea-land") refers to Sumer itself, and all that its culture stands for.57 As Enki's son and heir, Marduk represented a reach behind the Uruk tradition to the earlier one of Eridu, but incorporated the military might symbolized by Enlil, Ninurta and Ishtar. In the creation story, Marduk is a triumphant warrior against the original mother, who became the symbol of chaos. The king ruled now as Marduk's protege (and with equally absolute authority). The goddess Inanna became, in myth, an ineffectual troublemaker. As she appeared in the epic that made the exploits of Gilgamesh famous, she failed in her attempt to persuade the hero to marry her. The next big shift in consciousness, the one reflected in the biblical tradition, came as a result, again, of a qualitative change in the conception of human community. The shift from polytheism to monotheism accompanied the growing intuition, provoked by international relations as they developed in the ancient Near East, that humanity is one. Thus far, the state had been equated with the cosmos, and what lay outside it with chaos. The need arose to recognize the reality of other states and to define international relations in some way. I am referring here to complex processes at work in the ancient Near East throughout the course of the second millennium. One result of these processes can be seen in the form of an international treaty, known from Hittite and Egyptian records, from around the time of Israel's exodus 57 Ibid., p. 190.</page><page sequence="19">Wakeman: Ancient Sumer and the Women's Movement 25 from Egypt. That treaty form helps to clarify the understanding that Israel had of itself at a later time, as a collection of vassal states under one great king, Yahweh.58 God, whose fatherhood appears as a vestigial remnant from the days of polytheism, was preferable to the city-state kings of Canaan. Thus the king who became god provided a model for the god who became king over the tribes of Israel, in covenant federation, and over the federation of nations, in Isaiah's later vision. The mortal aspect of the goddess's husband Dumuzi, meaningful when it had been associated with the periodic death and rebirth of vegetation, was taken up and reinterpreted through Isaiah's figure of the suffering servant, which in turn shaped the way Christ was presented in the gospels. The process of reaching behind and encompassing to go beyond is characteristic in the continuing religious work of sanctioning new forms of political power. The Ethic Emerging in the Womens Movement In our fascination with prehistoric and ancient cultures the women's movement is reaching behind the intervening patriarchal development to recover our sense of connectedness with the earth, with other species, with each other, and with our own bodies. Meanwhile we have also built on Sumer's foundation. Patriarchal values have shaped us so that we regard ourselves as responsible agents, capable of taking charge of our relationship to the rest of the natural and human world, and capable of taking charge of reproduction as an aspect of our own species life. Our present situation calls for new ways of thinking, feeling and acting in response to conditions that have arisen in, and as a result of, a context of values that is no longer sufficient to deal with its own consequences: the power to destroy ourselves. The exercise of power by one person or group over another, the development of hierarchical forms of order, the emergence of unifying symbols, and the achievement of ego-centered personality all may be seen as relatively suc cessful strategies for dealing with environmental stress. But as a result of these strategies, we have achieved a degree of technological proficiency that requires us to become personally accountable in a new way. What it means to be a person has changed. In ancient Sumer, who you were was determined by what corporate group you were born into. There was no individual, legally speaking. The idea of voluntary association, the possibility of a community made up of those who had chosen rather than been born into it (and were morally culpable therefore), was the significant discovery (under historical pressure) of biblical faith. Still, the choice was made by men. What it means to be a person is changing now to a sense of self (whether male or female) that embodies a 58 George E. Mendenhall, "Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition," in The Biblical Archeologist Reader 3, ed. E. E Campbell, Jr. and David Noel Freedman (New York: Doubleday-Anchor, 1970), p. 39.</page><page sequence="20">26 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion whole community of interests and that is capable of finding its own order, of coordinating its will with others, and of being enlightened by other lives. Technological developments have brought us to a point where we can and therefore must take responsibility for maintaining ecological balances, for cooperating with nature rather than trying to get the better of it. Humanity has become one. No one can now avoid the realization that we as a species are dependent on one another for maintaining this small global garden in good health. Yet our experience of interdependency is different from the Sumerians in that it is self-centered. Valuing diverse experience is not just a plank in the platform; it is adjunct to the reevaluation of nature. Each person's own historical experi ence provides a way of coping creatively with the present circumstances of our common life. Having developed different strengths, we are a natural resource for one another. The idea of a political order based on the par ticularity of personal experience has a many-centered, or heterarchical struc ture.59 It includes everyone as we create among our diverse selves a new social reality which continues to be personally transformative. As we discover ways to restructure the family and social life so as to empower one another, the need for anyone to have power over another is obviated. New forms of religiosity are emerging that express a sense that order depends on variety and remind us not to allow a collapse into sameness. If as some say, "the personal is political," politics must be once again, as in prebiblical times, religious. As we reach behind patriarchy to recover the values of diversity in nature and culture, we encompass the achievement of a responsible self, and go beyond it to realize our interdependability. In doing so, we recover the notion of cosmic interdependency expressed in the ancient idea of the Sacred Marriage of heaven and earth. 59 James Ogilvy, Many Dimensional Man: Decentralizing Self, Society and the Sacred (New York: Oxford University Press, 1977), p. 115ff.</page><page sequence="21">CITIES OF ANCIENT SUMER EUPHRATESIVER X 'AGADE KISH ^ NtPPUR \ IR RIVER SIN UMMA\ GIRSU iIR ' LAGASH UR ERtDU PERSIAN GULF</page></plain_text>
