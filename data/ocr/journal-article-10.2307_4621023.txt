Here he must show whether he has understood or failed to recognize the true sense of the tragic. -Gilles Deleuze, Nietzsche and Philosophy Introduction While it has perhaps always accompanied philosophical thought-one immediately thinks of Plato's Dialogues-the problem of the communication of that thought, and therefore of its capacity to be taught, has been particularly insistent in the work of post- Kantian thinkers. One could cite Fichte's repeated efforts to formulate a definitive ver- sion of his Wissenschaftslehre, the model of the Bildungsroman that Hegel adopts for his Phenomenology of Spirit' Kierkegaard's pseudonymous works,2 Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and Heidegger's uncompleted Being and Time. Certainly each of these projects is quite distinct from the others, and the puzzles and difficulties of these works cannot be reduced to some single element, some trace of a philosophical zeit- geist. Their common preoccupation with the problem of the communicability of think- ing, however, raises the question of the modality of such a communication. How has thinking come to be so fundamentally troubled by its own expression? That Kant's critical philosophy has precipitated this preoccupation ought to come as no surprise, for it was Kant, most famously in the Critique of Pure Reason, who sought to definitively set the limits of philosophical thinking. In doing so, however, Kant was unable to remain utterly silent about what he himself set outside the bounds of meaningful thought and speech: things-in-themselves. That this meaningless ele- ment is an essential component of Kant's philosophical exposition3 is an indication of 1. On the Phenomenology of Spirit as a Bildungsroman, see Terry Pinkard's book, Hegel's Phenomenology: The Sociality of Reason: "Thus the Phenomenology serves as the Bildung (the education, formation, and cultivation) of its intended readership into coming to terms with what is entailed in their form of life and what kinds of alternatives are available to them" [17]. 2. On the peculiar nature of Kierkegaard's pseudonymous project and its relation and im- portance to his thought, see Alastair Hannay 's Kierkegaard: A Life: "If to master one's irony is to retain what one has written as a 'moment' in one's own development, then in order to share that development with the reader one must tip the reader continually forward, or backward, to as-yet indeterminate centres of gravity that converge on the author's own. If this is how it is with the pseudonymous works, then they form a new kind of literature, even a new kind of literary irony" [1521]. 3. ". .. we must be able at least to think, even if not [speculatively] cognize, the same ob- jects [appearances] also as things in themselves. For otherwise an absurd proposition would fol- low, viz. that there is appearance without anything that appears" [Kant, Critique of Pure Reason 28]. 22 diacritics 35.1: 22-46</page><page sequence="2">the paradoxical logic of the limit: to postulate a limit is simultaneously to set out its ob- verse side. In Kant's case, then, the demarcation of what can be thought carries with it the implicit thinking of what is ruled out of bounds for thought.4 Beginning with Fichte, the philosophical project of Kant's successors and inheritors is then largely determined by an effort to incorporate or at least accommodate this alien element within thinking.5 The initial phase of this effort is marked by a tragic motif [cf. Schmidt], a conjoining of thought with the experience of loss and suffering that is characteristic of Romanticism, that culminates in the dialectic of Hegel's Absolute Knowing. In Absolute Knowing, thought has not vanquished its limitations; it has instead discovered the resources with which it can perpetually surmount them. This first phase is followed by a reaction or re- sponse to this seeming completion and overcoming of the Kantian limitation. Now, the tragic movement of thought comes to be understood as itself limited, and necessarily so according to the logic of the limit that imposes itself upon every gesture of closure. Tragedy thereby gives way to comedy insofar as the limitation that is incorporated as an obstacle to be overcome by tragic thought is shown to be the external condition of that very thought. Finally, if the comic is the fate of the limitations of tragedy, the thought of comedy itself demands a third mode of thinking, one capable of something more than the mere reiteration of the limit between comedy and tragedy that troubles them both. This third form of expression is parody, an expression appropriate to a thinking that repeats and completes the threefold movement of tragic thought while, in this very repetition, creating a limitless domain of thoughtful expression. Nietzsche's work is the fulcrum of this problematization of the expression of thought. Beginning with The Birth of Tragedy, and continuing through his final works, Nietzsche perpetually confronts the difficulty of conveying his thinking. This confron- tation takes many forms: the aphoristic style and its accompanying commentary, the re- course to poetry, the grand fable of Zarathustra, and the critical reappropriation of Ecce Homo.6 Indeed, Nietzsche himself indicates the trajectory of the present essay when he writes, in the retrospective preface to the second edition of The Gay Science: "'Incipit tragoedia' we read at the end of this awesomely aweless book. Beware! Something downright wicked and malicious is announced here: incipit parodia, no doubt" [? 1 33]. Thought retrospectively, this book that announces the death of God, together with its necessarily correlates of will to power and eternal return, this book that apparently inaugurates a tragedy in fact stages the tragic movement as such, making a mockery of the book itself and, by circumscribing rather than working through the limiting move- ment of tragedy, produces a parody that will be expressed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. This retrospective thought, this critical self-examination, is introduced with the ques- tion of whether any reelaboration could make the thought of The Gay Science acces- 4. "That the human mind would someday entirely give up metaphysical investigations is just as little to be expected, as that we would someday gladly stop all breathing so as never to take in impure air" [Kant, Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics 121]. 5. "Against the proposed idealist mode of presentation it was immediately pointed out, that if something is to be determined as a subjective within the self, and something else by that deter- mination to be excluded from its sphere as objective, then it needs to be explained how this latter element, that is to be excluded, could come to be present in the self... Our present principle yields an answer to this objection, as follows: The objective to be excluded has no need at all to be present; all that is required-if I may so put it-is the presence of a check on the self, that is, for some reason that lies merely outside the self's activity, the subjective must be extensible no further" [Fichte, Science of Knowledge 189]. 6. Cf. Nietzsche's preface to On the Genealogy of Morals, ?8; the poetry that prefaces The Gay Science, as well as the "Aftersong" of Beyond Good and Evil, and, finally, the Dithyrambs of Dionysus. diacritics / summer 2005 23</page><page sequence="3">sible, communicable, and hence teachable.7 By concluding with a reappraisal of the passage from this work to Thus Spoke Zarathustra-a work that is entirely under the sign of the eternal return-Nietzsche indicates the complicity and dependence of this reevaluation with a doctrine which, Klossowski notes, is only ever "the simulacrum of a doctrine" ["Nietzsche, Polytheism, and Parody" 115]. Since speaking of eternal return is always a matter of effecting a double gesture, of creating an artistic difference that divides the course of the argument from its form, and since tragedy is, according to a particular interpretation, the sacrificial reconciliation of the particular and the uni- versal, then it might appear that tragedy is the expression through which the doctrine of eternal return attains a form other than that of a simulacrum. Such might be the course followed by an imagined Hegelian reading or recuperation of Nietzsche. Rather than pursue such a reading, Klossowski's thought takes another direction, according to which Nietzsche's doctrine of eternal return would, at the very least, remain irreducible to the tragic trajectory of Hegelian speculation and, in fact, might obtain the resources for an escape from this speculative dialectic. Although relatively unknown and unappreciated until recently by the English- speaking world, Pierre Klossowski's work was of enormous importance for the French interest in Nietzsche in the late 1950s and 60s. This so-called "return to Nietzsche" was, historically, a double break. On the one hand it was a new direction for Nietzsche stud- ies, which, at the time, were largely dominated by Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche, published in German in 1961 and translated into French by Klossowski in 1971. Hei- degger had previously gained recognition in France through his "Letter on Humanism," addressed to Jean Beaufret, as well as several lectures in France after the Second World War.8 In addition to breaking with the tradition of Nietzsche interpretations, the French return to Nietzsche became one of the rallying points for what Deleuze would call, in the preface to his Difference and Repetition, a "generalized anti-Hegelianism" [xix]. By the 1960s, the influence of Alexandre Kojbve's seminar--conducted three decades before--had already begun to fade as a new generation of thinkers who learned Hegel from Jean Hyppolite--either directly or through his translation of the Phenomenology and, later, his work Logic and Existence -came to prominence. Kojeve's reading of Hegel leaned heavily upon that of Alexandre Koyr6--whose class Kojeve took over- and developed itself through a prioritization of the dialectic of master and slave. Whereas Koyr6, in his equation of human consciousness with the Hegelian concept, had argued that history, as the temporal struggle of the unhappy con- sciousness -which itself is the effect of mortal temporality--must go on indefinitely, Kojbve maintained that the end of history had in fact arrived. Combining Koyr6's equa- tion of human consciousness to the concept with a strong reading of the dialectic of master and slave, Kojeve was able to claim that the eventual triumph of the slave brings the work of negativity to an end, and thus the human time which is history ceases. In Logic and Existence, Hyppolite reopened the question of the relation between Hegel's logic and his phenomenology: the very question that had previously been solved through the anthropomorphic reading of Hegel. Reversing the terms of the previous solution, Hyppolite advocated a reading in which historical, concrete moments are the expressions of the infinitely developing dialectical concept. It was this reading, one that 7. See the opening lines of the preface to the second edition to The Gay Science: "This book may need more than one preface, and in the end there would still remain room for doubt whether anyone who had never lived through similar experiences could be brought closer to the experience of this book by means of prefaces. It seems to be written in the language of the wind that thaws ice and snow . [. ." [?1 32]. 8.

Originally seen as a way of reconciling the vital intuition of Bergsonism with the rationality of French Neo-Kantianism, any anthropo- logical reading of Hegel's philosophy came to appear too reductive, especially after the war. Hyppolite's devaluation of the anthropological was an important first step in overcoming this reductiveness, but his joining of linguistic sense with the movement of the concept reopened the question of the plurality of meanings.10 In other words, Hyppolite's reading transported the problem of the limit that organizes the progress of the dialectic into the field of language. Once there, the problem is shown to be not only the effect of the limit within the operation of language, but also how the thought of this language can be communicated." For these reasons, Nietzsche's philosophical work acquired a vital new importance, grounded in the possibility of the creation of a new sense of the tragic and tragedy. Tragedy12 The self-knowing Spirit knows not only itself but also the negative of itself or its limit: to know one's limit is to know how to sacrifice oneself. -Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit For Hegel, tragedy's relevance to thinking is found in its form rather than in its use as an example. That is, what is philosophically significant about tragedy is found not in the example of a tragedy-not even Antigone-but in the dramatization of historical life that constitutes the tragic as a distinctive form of art, and of expression. Like Aris- totle, Hegel thinks of tragedy from an essentially ethical perspective: what is important is the role that the tragic form of expression plays within the historical life of Spirit. Within his Phenomenology, which is itself a dramatization of the historical education of Spirit as it comes to recognize itself, the moment of tragedy is found in the discovery of the antithesis of a given thesis, in the second moment of the dialectical triad.'3 In each of these moments, Spirit undergoes--for neither is it merely shown this as some- thing external, nor has it fully understood this movement as proper to itself--its own apparent fatality, and, for Hegel, the comprehension of this fatality is the achievement of Absolute Knowing. Through the course of its self-discovery, Spirit is led to recog- nize itself in its own contradictions, in the negatively postulated obverse side of each of its thematic moments. Ultimately, with the achievement of the reconciliation of the 9.

See Deleuze, "Review of Jean Hyppolite: Logic and Existence" [191-95]. Also, more generally, see Lawlor. 11. The first section of Hyppolite's Logic and Existence is entitled "The Ineffable." 12. The discussion in this section owes a great deal to Dennis Schmidt's work, On Germans and Other Greeks: Tragedy and Ethical Life, as well as conversations with the author. 13. In his On Germans and Other Greeks: Tragedy and Ethical Life, Schmidt outlines the four key aspects of the tragic structure in Hegel: (1) the tragic structure is only ever used in the second stage of the development of a particular concept; (2) the tragic only intervenes in the confrontation of a singularity with a universal; (3) the use of the tragic always raises the ques- tion of the concrete being of the law; and (4) the tragic must always be thought along with history [Schmidt 92-93]. diacritics / summer 2005 25</page><page sequence="5">two sides of the tragic limit, Spirit completes its self-knowing by apprehending itself immediately. The Phenomenology concludes with the stilling of tragedy, but it is a still- ness in which the particular content of each tragedy is left unfilled; what is concluded is the tragic dialectic of the limit. Beyond this reconciliation, as Hegel reveals in his Aesthetics, lies comedy. Although the limit understood tragically serves as the motive power of the Hege- lian dialectic, this does not mean that this limit possesses a timeless and constant form, mechanically reiterated in each case.'4 The "prose of the world" is variegated, and the expressions of the tragic limit are multiform.'5 Both the form and value of the tragic in the contemporary age are therefore questionable. This is the subject taken up by Hyppolite in his essay "The Tragic and the Rational in Hegel's Philosophy": what is the fate of tragedy in "the problematic of the end of history?" [255]. Hyppolite takes the tragic characterization of the dialectic for granted, and rather than defend or jus- tify this characterization--which he presumably agrees with--his central concern is with the claim that, "in the final system," the tragic movement and work of the nega- tive becomes a merely logical movement, devoid of existential characteristics. Such a conception "neglects a distinguishing feature of Hegelian thought: the relation of the rational, of reason (Vernunft), and the tragic. This relation surpasses that of human wis- dom and a positive organization of experience, such as one finds in the conceptions of the Enlightenment, and in the optimistic vision of 18th century thinkers; a vision that belongs properly to the understanding (Verstand) and not to the faculty of the Absolute (Vernunft)" [254]. Such a conflation of Hegel with Enlightenment thought forgets that, for Hegel, the tragic work of the negative is not a mere motor that brings about a purely positive result. The negative, "which in nature is the abyss and the silence of death, be- comes the absolute subject in the philosophy of spirit" [256]. The negative is therefore not what is purged or jettisoned in the ascent to Absolute Knowing, but is precisely what attains Absolute Knowing. The "panlogism" of the end of history is both the ne- gation of the tragic work of history and its truth, precisely insofar as the negation that preserves is the subject of that history. In Hegel's works up to and including the Phenomenology of Spirit one can see Hegel struggling to follow Fichte and Kant in "thinking the identity of the Subject and Morality" [258], but doing so in a way that simultaneously renders this identity concrete and avoids the empty indifference of Schelling's Absolute as it appears in his philosophy of nature. Hegel succeeds in this project through the "strange linkage" of the consciousness of death that forms human consciousness with the "rational and reasonable work that becomes the human city" [259]. Only in the struggle of the law against the reactive instincts of individual citizens does the absolute subject emerge. For the Enlightenment thinkers, this struggle can be reconciled, and this reconciliation defines the domain of the rational as an end to tragedy. Hyppolite, however, argues that precisely the opposite is the case with Hegel: tragedy is the destiny of the rational. For Hegel, the absolute subject is negativity, dissolution rather than resolution, and its activity is the existence of the political world. The determination of the understanding 14. Cf. Joseph Flay's essay "Hegel, Derrida, and Bataille's Laughter," which contests Der- rida's reading of Bataille against Hegel by pointing out the multiple ways in which sublation occurs in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. 15. The phrase "the prose of the world" is Hyppolite's but also serves as the title for an unfinished work by Maurice Merleau-Ponty that deals with the interrelation of language and thought. In a chapter entitled "Indirect Language," and in the course of a more extended discus- sion of Hegel, Merleau-Ponty writes, "So the Hegelian dialectic is what we call the phenomenon of expression, which gathers itself step by step and launches itself again through the mystery of rationality" [Prose of the World 85]. 26</page><page sequence="6">is only capable of producing "[t]he modern comedy, that is to say the bourgeois com- edy, [that] reveals the dialectic that is prey to avarice, love or sickness and that finds its absolute in a finite determination, preserving its life at all costs. Avarice, jealousy, the sickness of obsession, are, along with private right, the property system, and the play of economic relations, comic determinants for a foreign spectator, tragic ones for those who live them" [260]. For Hyppolite, then, comedy is only ever a residue of mere understanding. At the same time, however, Hyppolite concludes his essay with the question of whether Hegel's link between the tragic and the rational can be maintained in the face of the particularities of contemporary ethical life.16 The hesitation that Hyppolite expresses at the end of his essay over the link between the tragic and the rational, the very link that Hegel understands his Phenomenology to have overcome, is the outcome of a thought that follows Hegel in taking the limit - fig- ured as negativity--for the heart of dialectical thinking. According to this conception, comedy can only ever be the appearance of the superseded desire of the understanding to express what can only be thought by reason. In the discussion of dramatic art in his Aesthetics, however, Hegel gives a more intimate account of the link between trag- edy and comedy. It is this coupling of the tragic and the comic that Rodolphe Gasch6 addresses in his essay "Self-Dissolving Seriousness: On the Comic in the Hegelian Conception of Tragedy." At the heart of this essay is an interest in the consequences of the power of self-dissolution that Hegel attributes to comedy. For Gasch6, it is this power of self-dissolution that is primary, making possible not only tragedy but the very fracturing of the absolute that is the genesis of the tragic development of the dialectic. In other words, it is limitlessness that is primary and that makes possible limitation, with its accompanying drama of tragedy. By reading Hegel's Aesthetics back against the Phenomenology, Gasch6 thus provides a way for rethinking the essential kernel of the Hegelian dialectic that reveals it as one response to a limitlessness that, following Klossowski and Deleuze, also produces Nietzsche's conception of joy as amorfati, a conception that overturns the order of the dialectic. Within the system of the representative arts described in Hegel's Aesthetics, both tragedy and comedy are genres of dramatic poetry, which is the highest stage not only of poetry but of art itself [2: 1158]. In dramatic poetry Spirit itself becomes the content of representation insofar as the subject of dramatic poetry is action. For Hegel, because dramatic poetry supersedes and incorporates epic and lyric poetry, it both dramatizes the activity of Spirit in representation and at the same time shows representation to be the appraisal of something else. Because the object of representation remains distinct from its subject, dramatic poetry heralds the end of art. Since dramatic poetry divides into the genres of tragedy and comedy, what is the justification for Hegel's claim that the tragic genre is exemplary for the speculative or dialectical movement of dramatic poetry in general? Such a question requires a closer look at the self-division of drama. Poetry in general, according to Hegel, is both the appearance of Spirit in actual- ity and the rendering presentable of this appearance in speech. Insofar as poetry is the presentation of Spirit in its actuality, its genres will correspond to the different artistic modes or determinations in which Spirit is articulated. In Hegel's words, "As a totality of art, not exclusively confined by any one-sidedness in its material [language] to any one sort of execution, poetry takes for its specific form the different modes of artistic production in general; and therefore the basis for dividing and articulating the different 16. "Conflicts assume a planetary dimension, and the technique of means of production or destruction have overthrown the field of experience. In this new human world, however, the tragic is not able to disappear. We see it well in what threatens human existence in its precarious- ness, but we are not sure, as Hegel was, that it coincides with the rational. This coincidence is still a form of optimism that we can no longer postulate" [261]. diacritics / summer 2005 27</page><page sequence="7">i:?:::i:i::!! i:i::::Li:::::_  !i:::j .: . : :!: ; :. ;/; ::: ? ::: :: :::" : i? :: :: ? : :: ? : ? ?: :: : i! :: , i4t . : : U, ? ?. , ? iii ? . . ...... ..

Since Hegel has already shown that artistic presentation is divided ac- cording to arts that favor subjective expression and arts that favor objective expression, poetry too must be divided in the same way. What is important in the case of poetry, however, is that this distinction is now a distinction of the very power of representa- tion. The poetic expression that favors the objective is epic poetry, and, insofar as it is concerned with the representation of things accessible to mere sensory experience, it comes before lyric poetry, which is the representation of inner states. Uniting these two forms and bringing about the end of art itself is a third form of poetry: dramatic poetry [2: 1158]. Dramatic poetry combines and supersedes both epic and lyric by presenting ac- tions in a way that gives priority to these actions themselves, rather than to their subjec- tive or objective origins. In its prioritization of action, dramatic poetry is not concerned with Spirit in its unity but rather with the presentation of the actions into which Spirit divides in coming to appearance; dramatic poetry represents the resolution of these essentially divided forces. According to this description, dramatic poetry divides, of it- self, into different genres according to the manner in which the individual characters of the drama proceed to resolution through action: tragedy and comedy are the two ways in which action brings about the resolution of sundered Spirit within representation. Put another way, tragedy and comedy are the two ways in which Spirit gives itself to repre- sentation, depending upon whether the agent or the situation comes to be emphasized. In tragedy, the resolution of Spirit's self-differentiation into agents and an objec- tive situation is achieved through the imposition of harmony by the objective aspect of Spirit's representation. According to Hegel, the tragic situation is one where each agent possesses justification for their actions, but these actions nonetheless enter into conflict [Aesthetics 2: 1194]. The resolution of such a situation is achieved when the conflict is eliminated through the imposition of a situation that does not eliminate the action of subjects, but eliminates their conflict. Insofar as this conflict arose through the promotion of a singular and individual will to action, the conflict is eliminated when the defiantly individual character of the action is overcome. "In tragedy the eternal sub- stance of things emerges victorious in a reconciling way, because it strips away from the conflicting individuals only their false one-sidedness, while the positive elements in what they willed it displays as what is to be retained, without discord but affirmatively harmonized" [2: 1199]. Whereas in tragedy the contradictions of the represented actions are resolved through the imposition of an objective order that reconciles these actions through the destruction of the one-sided tragic individual, in comedy the contradictions of the rep- resented actions are resolved through the elevation of the comic individual's subjec- tivity to the point that it overcomes and resolves the contradictions of representation through the elimination of the objective aspect of actions. The comedic subject is able to resolve the conflicts of his or her actions by affirming subjectivity as the irreduc- ible, cohesive unity of these actions. This triumph of the subject mirrors the triumph of substance in tragedy. In each case it is one aspect of divided Spirit that emerges to resolve the disorder intrinsic to representation. For Gasch6, however, this mirroring duality that itself must be resolved in order for Spirit to be properly expressed-and that seems to adhere more closely to the form of tragedy-displays particular, comic characteristics. In comedy, the dissolution of the subject, the self-destruction of all of the plans and projects of the protagonist, has as its consequence the emergence of a subject who is no longer tied to the world of representation, and "this concern with the self-dissolution of the subject is the ground for a certain excellency of comedy over tragedy" [Gasch6 diacritics / summer 2005 29</page><page sequence="9">52]. But is comedy really the self-dissolution of the subject? Certainly in comedy one witnesses the destruction of an individual's projects. However, this collapse itself does not have a destructive character, but is rather the condition for the emergence of sub- jectivity as the order of the forces of dissolution. Hegel writes, in a passage central to Gasch6's thesis, that "drama is the dissolution of the one-sidedness of those powers which are making themselves independent in the dramatic characters, whether, as in tragedy, their attitude toward one another is hostile, or whether, as in comedy, they are revealed directly as self-dissolving" [Aesthetics 2: 1163]. Whereas tragedy indi- cates the self-dissolution of the differentiated forces of Spirit only indirectly, through the imposition of substantial order, subjective order is revealed directly by comedy, since it is the only possible sort of action remaining amidst the general collapse of the protagonist's finite projects. It is this direct presentation of the unity of the forces of Spirit that is indicative of the fundamental role of the comic in the dialectic. The comic would be the pro- cess through which a truth is revealed by the exhaustive elimination of its apparent possibilities. It is the comic, then, that enables dialectical progression, insofar as this progression occurs when a truth is revealed to endure beyond the exhaustion of the expressions to which it gives rise. For example, in the Phenomenology of Spirit, the "this" of perception is revealed by the exhaustive iterations of sense-certainty." In this reading of the dialectic, the tragic would then be the dialectical progression that occurs only after the antagonism of conflicting aspects of Spirit is overcome through the elimi- nation of the partisan character of the antagonist. To summarize, neither the comic nor the tragic as dialectical development is more fundamental than the other; both are the essential and inevitable consequents of the representation of Spirit. In representation, the sheer positivity of Spirit's initial appearance is dissolved by the exhaustion of this expression, while the result of this exhaustion is reconciled with the original positing by grasping the action of the opposition and so eliminating the partisan character of each side. This result is itself a new affirmative positing of Spirit, and so is subjected to a new comedy and tragedy. Ultimately, as the Phenomenology of Spirit shows, art emerges in religion-comedy and tragedy themselves come onto the scene of repre- sentation-and the tragedy of the end of art becomes the recapitulation of absolute knowing. Comedy For the present, the comedy of existence has not yet "become conscious" of itself. For the present, we still live in the age of moralities and religions. -Nietzsche, The Gay Science For Hegel tragedy is a specific sort of dramatic poetry, and poetry in general is the concrete appearance of Spirit in representation that joins in itself the objective aspect of the plastic arts and the subjective aspect of music. The result of this jointure is an act whose different kinds-epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry-each work to give expression to Spirit through the imagination, which is the faculty that mediates between sense perception and thought. In coming to expression, Spirit falls prey to the extremes of the imagination. Epic poetry is then the imaginative representation of Spirit that medi- ates between sense perception and thought through an emphasis upon the sensual and 17. Cf. Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, "Sense Certainty: Or the 'This'and 'Meaning'" 58-66. 30</page><page sequence="10">objective, while lyric poetry emphasizes the inner and subjective. Only in dramatic poetry, which is the resolution of the extreme tendencies of lyric and epic, is the tension between the subjective and objective taken up explicitly. In a series that mirrors the development of poetry in general, tragedy is the form of dramatic poetry that resolves the tension between epic and lyric action through the imposition of an objective order that eliminates the subjective as such, and comedy resolves the same tension through the disclosure of a triumphant subjectivity that endures the elimination of the objective. Ultimately, the exhaustion of the comic eliminates art itself insofar as, in comedy, the triumphant subject is utterly cut off from substance, which has become null. The me- diation of tragedy and comedy is thus only accomplished by thinking, which grasps and resolves tragedy and comedy as the two highest powers of imagination. In the subject that is produced by the comic dissolution of substance, thinking emerges as the real- ization that all of the manifestations of substance are, in the end, only manifestations for the subject. Thought supersedes imagination when comedy reveals the identity of subject and substance. While Gasch6 claims, at the conclusion of his essay, that it is the comic that under- lies the tragic, a closer reading of these two forms in their incorporation into Hegel's dialectic shows that this dialectic develops both comically and tragically. In good Hege- lian fashion, neither is ascendant over the other but each forms essential moments of Spirit's self-disclosure. As the elimination of the pretensions of individual subjectivity, the tragic corresponds to the dialectical production of substantial truth. In other words, in the language of Deleuze's Nietzsche and Philosophy, tragedy, in the Hegelian dialec- tic, marks the determination of difference as always consisting of a negative relation to substantial truth. As the first movement in Spirit's imaginative development, tragedy is the coordination of the apparent individual with Spirit's substantial unity. Comedy is joined to tragedy--and, more generally, the comic is joined to the tragic--insofar as tragedy's coordination of difference establishes the space for the exhaustion of this very difference and thus for a sublation of that particular division of Spirit. For De- leuze, then, the tragic is the heart of the dialectic, the first coordination of difference that controls the entire development of Hegel's thought. What is at stake in the prioritization of the tragic aspect of the Phenomenology of Spirit over its comic aspect is revealed by Gillian Rose in her essay "The Comedy of Hegel and the Trauerspiel of Modem Philosophy." There, in the course of seeking a new critical stance toward Hegel's work as it relates to the question of the relation between the individual and the law, Rose argues that in order to ethically challenge the apparent liquidation of the concrete in Hegel's philosophy, the comic and tragic strands must be distinguished, not merely in order to understand Hegel, but in order to follow Hegel, in the sense of both inheriting his philosophy and, in this inheritance, taking a critical distance from it. To follow Hegel in a nontragic fashion involves abandon- ing "the dialectical oppositions of the Understanding" [Rose 17, her emphasis] that characterize many of the contemporary attempts to think otherwise than Hegel. To oppose Hegel tragically-that is, to oppose Hegel by adopting a misreading of Hegel's own philosophy -is to condemn such critique to perpetual reiteration, inasmuch as any tragic critique preserves what it attempts to abolish or supersede, and substitutes an empty and deferred hope for the objectivity of Absolute Knowing.18 18. "For if all human law is sheer violence, if there is no positive or symbolic law to be acknowledged-the law that decrees the absence of the other, the necessity of relinquishing the dead one, returning from devastating inner grief to the law of the everyday and of relationships, old and new, with those who live-then there can be no work, no exploring of the legacy of ambivalence, working through the contradictory emotions aroused by bereavement. Instead, the remains of the dead one will be incorporated into the soul of the one who cannot mourn and will diacritics / summer 2005 31</page><page sequence="11">The antidote to this "aberrated mourning" is a reinterpretation of the work of the limit in Hegel's dialectical logic. Like Gasch6, for Rose, Hegel's Spirit seems to be de- veloped through tragedy, but the problem that motivates this development is dramatized comically: "a ceaseless comedy, according to which our aims and outcomes constantly mismatch each other, and provoke yet another revised aim, action and discordant out- come" [18]. The phenomenological education of reason is comic because its method is constant but its discoveries are never orchestrated. Giving Hegel the benefit of the doubt, maintaining that concepts are only ever constituted through particular experi- ence, and therefore that the concepts of his Phenomenology are not mere abstractions, the phenomenological pupil is surprised precisely by the difference between the pupil's determination and the comprehension of the initially misapprehended double gesture of this determination. Setting out conceptual determinations, reason limits its comprehen- sion, a determinate limitation that becomes part of the comedy of misrecognition but is also tragic by virtue of the hasty but insistent occlusion of the work of this limitation on behalf of the Whole to be constituted. In the contemporary world, however, this tragic vector is absent; the totalizing and postulated Whole of Hegel has not only vanished but become suspect.'9 Without this Whole, the tragic as reconciling is no longer pos- sible, and what remains is the persistence of misrecognition, which now assumes the character of law [Rose 18-19]. For Hegel, "spirit" is only ever a "short-hand term for the threefold state of the misrecognizing parties" [Rose 20]. Thus, the tragedy of the dialectic calls thought to the comic moment in which the dialectic itself is taken up by thinking. This is the world in which God is dead-the world that therefore demands the intertwined notions of will to power and eternal return. The very title of Gilles Deleuze's 1962 work on Nietzsche--Nietzsche and Phi- losophy-indicates what Deleuze makes clear in the text: that Nietzsche's work may be read as a polemic. It is useful to remember that "polemic" was the subtitle given to On the Genealogy of Morals by Nietzsche himself--and it may be read as one directed against dialectical thinking. "Nietzsche and Philosophy": this means Nietzsche over against philosophy. As Nietzsche makes clear in a number of passages, the untimeli- ness of his texts requires a certain interpretive distance.20 Reading Nietzsche on his own terms involves an interpretation that is at once historical and artistic, or creative. This creativity marks both the affinity and the difference between Deleuze's interest in Nietzsche and the French interest in Marx, with which it coincided chronologically. Marx's literally "revolutionary" -turning it on its head-reading of the Hegelian dia- lectic was, like Nietzsche's transvaluation of values, an attempt to reintegrate the ob- manifest themselves in some all too physical symptom, the allegory of incomplete mourning in its desolate hyper-reality" [17]. 19. Cf. Adorno: "The fact is that the principle of the absolute spirit, which is a curiously indifferent determinant existing between transcendence and the quintessence of the human mind as its own most comprehensive totality, tirelessly destroys what it purports to express. It cease- lessly absorbs into itself what it seeks to formulate as the absolute, which is supposedly impervi- ous to such assimilation. For this reason-and on this point Hegel, if you like, needs to be taken beyond himself-its supreme concept, the absolute, in which everything is supposed to come to rest, becomes dialectical within itself, so that spirit, in becoming absolute for itself, is at the same time, by virtue of everything that is, absorbed into the mind as a human entity, thus destroying the transcendence or absoluteness of the idea which it asserts" [Metaphysics 122]. 20. In an interview conducted in 1967, Deleuze says: "From the very beginning of his work, Nietzsche posits that there exist ends 'just a little higher' than those of the State, than those of society. He inserts his entire corpus in a dimension which is neither historical, even understood dialectically, nor eternal. What he calls this new dimension which operates both in time and against time is the untimely. It is in this that life as interpretation finds its source " ["Nietzsche's Burst of Laughter" 129]. 32</page><page sequence="12">verse side of determinate limitation that the tragic movement of Hegel's dialectic per- petually eliminated.21 For Nietzsche, however, this reintegration involves not merely the reprioritization of one of the elements of the dialectic, but the dissolution of the very positions that constitute it and determine its course. Finding in Nietzsche an ac- count of the "dissolution of the self," a dissolution of the very position of positing from which determinate limitation is derived, Deleuze finds a thinking in which everything is misrecognition--the misrecognition of the subject by itself--such that the world of will to power appears akin to Rose's conception of the world of comedy.22 "There is no possible compromise between Hegel and Nietzsche," Deleuze writes. Nietzsche 's philosophy has a great polemical range; it forms an absolute anti- dialectics and sets out to expose all the mystifications that find a final refuge in the dialectic. What Schopenhauer dreamed of but did not carry out ... Nietzsche carries out . .. setting up a new image of thought, freeing thought from the burdens which are crushing it. Three ideas define the dialectic: the idea of a power of the negative as a theoretical principle manifested in op- position and contradiction; the idea that suffering and sadness have value, the valorization of the "sad passions," as a practical principle manifested in splitting and tearing apart; the idea of positivity as a theoretical and prac- tical product of negation itself. It is no exaggeration to say that the whole of Nietzsche's philosophy, in its polemical sense, is the attack on these three ideas. [Deleuze, Nietzsche and Philosophy 195-96] "In its polemical sense," when read as a polemic, by an interpreter who wants a weap- on, Nietzsche's philosophy develops a style of thinking that overturns the fundamental ideas of dialectical thought. Such an interpretation develops an account of a "new im- age of thought." However, this new image of thought that would surpass dialectical thought is not yet the doctrine of eternal return. This new type of thought is that of will to power, a comedic thought, expressed in the differential play of fictional masks, of series of interpretations without origin or ground that form genealogies--rather than lineages--of thought. Nietzsche and Philosophy is therefore not so much a commen- tary on Nietzsche as the repetition and redeployment of Nietzsche's style within the particular problematic constituted by French Hegelianism.23 Nietzsche and Philosophy begins not with an account of forces and will to power, nor with Nietzsche's concept of ressentiment, but rather with Nietzsche's concept of the tragic. In the new distance that he claims Klossowski's interpretation of Nietzsche opens, Deleuze develops a weapon against the dialectic that challenges not the content or the conclusion of the dialectic but its formal structure. In his description of the formal 21. In an interview conducted in 1968, Deleuze makes explicit the connection between Marx and Nietzsche, emphasizing their respective conceptions of "value" ["On Nietzsche and the Im- age of Thought" 136]. 22. Cf Nietzsche: "For the old gods, after all, things came to an end long ago; and verily, they had a good gay godlike end. They did not end in a 'twilight,' 'though this lie is told. Instead: one day they laughed themselves to death. That happened when the most godless word issued from one of the gods themselves-the word: 'There is one god. Thou shalt have no other god before me!'An old grimbeard of a god, a jealous one, thus forgot himself. And then all the gods laughed and rocked on their chairs and cried, 'Is not just this godlike that there are gods but no God?'" [Thus Spoke Zarathustra, third part, "On Apostates," ?2 294]. 23. It is only in his Difference and Repetition, where the task is the elaboration of a "thought without image," that Deleuze will present something like an account of eternal return in his de- scription of differential thinking. See esp. chap. 2, "Repetition for Itself. " diacritics / summer 2005 33</page><page sequence="13">structure of the Hegelian dialectic, Deleuze follows the interpretation of Hyppolite's Logic and Existence, which had appeared in 1954. In his 1954 review of that work, De- leuze stresses the fundamentally Nietzschean insight that orients Hyppolite's reading of Hegel and that most pointedly marks its difference from Kojeve's earlier anthropo- logical reading. By casting human language as the finite becoming of Spirit, and at the same time eliminating the supposition of an ineffable "beyond" that would lie outside of language (a statement that can no longer even make sense given that language is the Absolute), Hyppolite moves Hegel decisively beyond Kantian transcendentalism and in a direction that already begins to aligns Hegel with Nietzsche's claims concerning the fabulation of the world, the elimination of the world of essences that is described most vividly in The Twilight of the Idols. As Klossowski emphasizes, the world becom- ing fable ultimately means that the world becomes nothing but narratives, nothing other than language. For Hyppolite and Deleuze, the Phenomenology of Spirit is not a discourse about human beings; it is not an anthropology produced by something superior to its object; it is an ontological discourse. In the Phenomenology language learns to speak of itself. Language is properly philosophical, properly thoughtful, when it both exceeds and negates the empirically given and, at the same time, in its positive relation to itself, exceeds and negates the essence understood as language's concretion outside of the empirical. Hyppolite follows Hegel in thinking this struggle according to the move- ment of negation, which he understands to be the logically ultimate form of differ- ence. It is this formulation of language as structured by negation--and not Hyppolite's claims regarding the links between empiricism, transcendentalism, and ontology - that Deleuze seizes upon. Negation as contradictory difference orients his critique of Hege- lian dialectics, and this negation, and so also the critique, is a matter of language. Only in the context of Hyppolite's tragic interpretation of the Hegelian dialectic can the opening provided by Klossowski's dramatic reading of Nietzsche prove so decisive for Deleuze.24 In Deleuze's reading of Nietzsche, the concept of will to power does not arise from any sort of phenomenology and is not put forth in order to constitute a new ontology. It is neither the result of a disinterested point of view nor an attempt to reveal the truth of the world. Will to power is the concept of a thinking that apprehends bodies in terms of what relations they are capable of and constituted by. That is, bodies are merely so many masks, so many transitory alliances of forces that seek other forces with which to continue and elaborate their own power. Thus consciousness becomes the form of a body always constituted only through relations with other bodies. For such a style of thinking, even the thinker must be accounted for and explained, since it is the think- ing of this principle of will to power that will determine the use of such a thought. In order to constitute a thinking that takes as its principle not a single truth but a will to produce new legislations of bodies, unitary consciousness can no longer function as a ground for knowledge. Knowledge and truth are no longer the aim of thinking; in Nietzsche, thinking enters into an alliance with the becoming of particular forces- an alliance organized and thought according to will to power--and attempts to welcome the future rather than predict it, by affirming the struggle of forces rather than the tran- sitory identity of bodies that are only the symptoms of a partial apprehension of present limitations.25 24. In Difference and Repetition, Deleuze praises Klossowski's work and singles out "two articles which renew the interpretation of Nietzsche:" "Nietzsche, le polythdisme et la parodie" and "Oubli et anamnese dans l'experience vecue de l'tternel retour du Meme" [Difference and Repetition 312]. 25. Where Rose sees this comedy as the possibility for action, Michael Hardt writes: "De- 34</page><page sequence="14">Throughout his reading of Nietzsche, Deleuze is concerned with differentiating two senses of affirmation in order to make clear the difference of Nietzsche's thought from the movement of the dialectic, which also may be read as affirming the difference of the future, of the obverse side of the limitation of the present, in its movement of tragic reconciliation. The dialectical resolution of limitation, as found in Hegel, pro- ceeds through the affirmation of negation. To escape the dialectic it is not enough to merely reverse this relation, or to select one side over another. What is at stake is the dynamics of the movement taken as a whole: whereas the Hegelian dialectic works in the service of reconciliation, the justification of the negative moment by the affirmation that it alone can give, Nietzsche's thought is organized by the concept of the Overman, which, Nietzsche makes clear in Ecce Homo, is not merely a new type of human being, but "the supreme type of all beings" [305; qtd. in Deleuze, Nietzsche and Philosophy 177]." As Deleuze emphasizes, the Overman is not to be confused with the ass of Zarathustra's last supper. The ass affirms without negation, whereas the Overman, as the achievement of will to power, affirms by attuning this affirmation to the negation that is its precursor and aftershock. According to Rose's depiction of the Hegelian dialectic, the ass affirms the system of misrecognition, but without concern for this misrecognition, producing a tragicomedy (that of the "higher men"26); the Overman af- firms the system of misrecognition by denying the determinate negation that constitutes identity by dividing forces from their expressions, thereby negating the very form of the dialectic--its particular logic of limitation--and so affirming the misrecognition of misrecognition itself. This is the comedic style of Nietzsche's thought in Deleuze's reading: a new image of thought that fractures the tragic vector of the Hegelian dialec- tic and so affirms the struggle for recognition, for expression, rather than its resolution. Such is the world in which God is dead but thinking lives on. Deleuze's reading of Nietzsche uses the latter's thought in order to undermine Hegel's tragic dialectic by critiquing the limiting operation that determines the identi- ties of the positing position and its contradictory position. The aim of this reading, one that relies heavily upon the will to power, is the elimination of recognition as a problem: misrecognition appears as a problem to be overcome only for a thinking that requires an absolutely sanctioned identity in order to ground worldly justice (absolute order). The comedy of will to power reconfigures the question of justice by affirming the difference of the positions as primary, relegating their determinate delimitation to a derivative role. Recognition (rather than misrecognition) is thereby revealed as a problem inasmuch as it is always erroneous; it always mistakes appearances for the forces that constitute them [Rose 18-20]. The solution to this problem is what Deleuze calls "selection."27 Such selection is not the conscious choice of an individual, but rather the selection of forces (and so also of individuals) by the world such that the misrecognition of transitive identities becomes the by-product of a more fundamental mutual exchange of subindividual forces. Comedy is the style of thought in which this selection is prioritized; tragedy is that style of thought that inverts this relation. Indeed, Deleuze will claim that the interpretation of the tragic is the touchstone by which one can differentiate Nietzsche from Hegel, and genealogy from dialectical speculation. leuze's 'impersonal' reading of Nietzsche blocks the development of a theory of practice because it limits our conception of agents to the interplay of forces" [Gilles Deleuze 54]. What Hardt fails to take note of here is the question of the needfor a theory of practice. 26. In the fourth part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Zarathustra is brought to the realization that his greatest temptation to forsake the overcoming of human beings is that of "pity" for the higher men ["The Sign" 439]. 27. Cf. Deleuze, Nietzsche and Philosophy 188-91; Deleuze also contends that Zarathus- tra's demon is nihilism [191 ff.]. diacritics / summer 2005 35</page><page sequence="15">Klossowski's essay "Nietzsche, Polytheism, and Parody" is of crucial importance for parsing the effects of this differentiation because it reconfigures the problem of the limit in terms of dissolution rather than resolution. This new sense of the prob- lem emerges through a reconceptualization of Hegel's resolution of the tragic conflict between the particular and the universal. Although he did not develop the concept in these terms, Klossowski's concept of parody, which he draws from Nietzsche and then uses to read him, is an expression of this other solution to the tragic situation, one that also works to reinterpret the terms of that situation. In elaborating the details of Klossowski's concept of parody, as well as his reading of eternal return, what comes to light is not only the historical importance of Klossowski's interpretation, but also its philosophical importance as a basic challenge to the order of dialectical thought. In his essay Klossowski develops a conception of parody from a reading of Nietzsche that is oriented by his claims about language and breaks decisively with the tragicomic move- ment of thought. Parody28 His [Nietzsche's] task lies elsewhere: beyond all the codes of past, present and future, to transmit something that does not and will not allow itself to be codified. To transmit it to a new body, to invent a body that can receive it and spill it forth; a body that would be our own, the earth's, or even something written.... --Gilles Deleuze, "Nomad Thought" What, then, of parody? Initially it is not clear whether Klossowski's essay "Nietzsche, Polytheism, and Parody" even offers a working-out of this concept. It seems to be mentioned only in passing. However, the three moments announced in the title of the essay are not three separate topics; they are intertwined themes. Thus, the case of "Nietzsche" unfolds the question of polytheism, the question of the artistic refabulation of the world, and the coming to thought of this refabulation in the case of "Nietzsche" demands a consideration of parody. When Klossowski insists upon parody in discuss- ing Nietzsche, he is concerned with the style of the communicability of what, following Nietzsche, he calls "the experience of the eternal return."29 This experience- funda- mentally irreducible to either a biographical or metaphysical narrative--is, for Klos- sowski, Nietzsche's decisive contribution to the genealogy of philosophical thought since Hegel. Subjecting Nietzsche to the strictures of his own philosophical writings, Klossowski writes of Nietzsche's experience as a philosopher, in whom the drive for the truth about finite existence enters into combat with the conscious goal of secur- ing a meaning for that existence. That is, in Nietzsche the divine comedy of existence as thought by will to power is juxtaposed with the tragic desire for the securing of a meaning in the midst of this comedy. This seemingly insoluble opposition of comedy and tragedy-two elements that are also indissociable from each other-forms the sub- stance of the thought of eternal return. Beginning with eternal return, rather than will to power, allows Klossowski to approach the tension between Nietzsche's and Hegel's 28. Although parody is not a term with much currency in contemporary philosophical de- bates, it has figured strongly in literary theory and performance studies, particularly in the wake of Bakhtin. For a useful overview of this work, see Dentith. 29. Klossowski, "Nietzsche, Polytheism, and Parody" 105. Klossowski's interest in the eter- nal return, and Nietzsche generally, dates back to his essays published in Bataille's journal Ac6phale in the 1930s. 36</page><page sequence="16">styles of thought in a different way than Deleuze. Specifically, Klossowski's essay is the production of a new style of thought--parody--that is reducible to neither the tragic nor the comic tendency of thought because in it limitation is dissolved rather than resolved.30 One of the most persistent questions in Klossowski's reading of Nietzsche, and especially in his work on The Gay Science, is that of Nietzsche's style or mode of presentation.31 Again and again the reader finds Klossowski asking who Nietzsche is writing for and wondering how the thought of eternal return might be communicated or taught. In following Klossowski's text one is then led to wonder about Klossowski's own style and what sort of text could function as a commentary on what is, in the end, merely "a simulacrum of a doctrine" [NPP 115]. What is at issue here is the very form or structure of Klossowski's and Nietzsche's text and, in questioning it, the reader takes a certain distance from the text, stands back and takes note of its overall shape even as the argument unfolds. This distance is that "artistic difference" that Nietzsche speaks of in the final aphorism of the exemplary second book of The Gay Science [? 107 163-64]; a distance that, insofar as it leads us - as Nietzsche says - to laugh or to weep over our- selves, is a space of involvement rather than renunciation, a space of play rather than objectivity. Moreover, the form or play of this reading demanded by Klossowski's text is not merely incidental to any presumed "content." The simulated doctrine of eternal return demands such an expression as its proper content: artistic difference is the ex- pression, not the effect, of eternal return. Parody is the mode of communication of the thought of a dissolved or fractured consciousness. Applied to the case of Nietzsche, the question of parody entails a read- ing of Nietzsche as a case of such a fractured consciousness. This question orients Klossowski's treatment of Nietzsche as a philosopher-as one whose particular task is caught up with consciousness itself and hence also with the status of the doctrine of eternal return as a philosophical doctrine. In his attempt to determine the content or forces expressed in the texts that are gathered under the proper name "Nietzsche," Klossowski finds that the texts exhibit the struggle between an individuated conscious- ness and the impulsive forces from which it arises. In Nietzsche, as a philosopher, consciousness turns toward pathos, turns toward these impulsive forces, in order to discover and express its own truth. In this returning, consciousness, which is already a sort of inversion or perversion of pathos, suffers another inversion: what escaped the flux of pathetic life is forced once again to submit to its turmoil. It is this inverted in- version-both similar and strikingly different from Hegel's infamous "negation of the negation" -that precipitates Klossowski's essay from a prosopographical concern with the existence named "Nietzsche" to the question of polytheism. In its inverting return to the flux of pathos truth gives way to simulation as language becomes fable. Truth is thus revealed as the hypostasis of the flux of impulsive life, a simulation mistaken by conscious life for the ground of the impulses that produce it; and language is similarly transformed from a vehicle for conscious, determinate meaning into the im- personal expression of the vicissitudes of impulsive life. For Klossowski, simulation is always dramatic since it is produced by the inverted inversion of consciousness, by the fragmentary amplification of a multitude of pathetic forces. Dramatic simulation is the "willed error" of the artist, the one who allows for the creation of life [NPP 106-08]. 30. 113-14. Klossowski, following Nietzsche, refers to the comedic tendency as the will to adoration, and the tragic tendency as the will to eternalization. 31. "Nietzsche, Polytheism and Parody" is the final essay in Un si funeste d6sir. Together with the first essay, "On Some Fundamental Themes of Nietzsche's Gaya Scienza," it places the entire book under the influence of Nietzsche's thought. diacritics / summer 2005 37</page><page sequence="17">The resultant polytheism is echoed in Nietzsche's "I am every name in history,"32 the becoming-imperceptible of conscious character, a dissolution of constitutive subjectiv- ity into multiplicity. Taking himself as an actor, as one in whom the artistic force of life gives birth to so many identities as expressions of life's creativity, Nietzsche gives expression to the doctrine of this vital and fortuitous creation. In coming to expression, however, this doctrine-that of eternal return-is revealed as the "authentic incom- municable" [NPP 110]; its demands are irreconcilable and unavoidable. Thus to parody Nietzsche, to apprehend the most essential elements of the fortuitous that characterize the thought of eternal return, is the only way to ensure that we do not say more or less than what Nietzsche himself said [NPP 83]. According to Klossowski, the decisive event for the expression of eternal return is Nietzsche's creation of Zarathustra, who first appears in the published works in the final aphorism of the then-final book 4 of The Gay Science. Zarathustra, to be sure, was latent in the previous works, but what is im- portant for Nietzsche's life is not only the creation and presence of the inef- fable songs of the poem. What came to be determinant for Nietzsche 's life was the more or less complete identification of Nietzsche with this physiognomy, which for him constituted a kind of promise, a resurrection, an ascension. In a certain sense, Zarathustra is the star of which Nietzsche himself is only the satellite. Even better, I would say that Nietzsche, after having paved the way for the triumph of Zarathustra, remains behind in a position sacrificed in the course of a victorious retreat. As he himself said, he would pay dearly for this creation. [NPP 86] Zarathustra is the reflection or self-recollection of Nietzsche. As it does for Hegel, this self-recollection of thought-its return-propels thought through fundamental change. In Nietzsche's case, however, the recollection of Zarathustra is a subversion of Nietzsche's own constitution. With this subversion, the truth of identity is revealed as a fable of multiplicity, a transformation detailed in the famous passage from The Twilight of the Idols entitled "How the True World Ends by Becoming Fable" [485-86]. For Klossowski, this oft-cited passage provides an account of the creation of Zara- thustra. In its pursuit of the true world, which is initially conceptualized as separated from the thinking subject, delimited by its own recognition, self-consciousness is driv- en to the discovery that any attempt to let thinking serve as the bridge between the true world and apparent world--as well as the accompanying and seemingly essential frustration of these attempts -ends not merely with the abolition of the true world but with the transformation of the work of thinking. The disclosure of the apparent world as the truth of the true world does not reveal what Klossowski calls "the real world of scientific positivism" [NPP 87]. Such a world would merely repeat the erroneous delimitation that dialectical thought would bridge. The elimination of the true world is the end of thought as the mediation or medium between substantial or essential worlds. What remains is thought, as the production (fabulation) of temporary points of equilib- rium amidst the play of impulsive forces that form the fortuitous and comical play of the world's misrecognition. Ceasing to be anywhere or anything other than the reflec- tively coiling movement of thought, narrative comes to constitute the substantiality of the world. 32. Nietzsche, Letter to Jacob Burckhardt, dated January 6, 1889, in The Portable Nietzsche [686]. 38</page><page sequence="18">For Klossowski, Zarathustra is nothing other than this fabulation, not simply a fable but the very force that surges forth in the collapse of thought's movement of tragic mediation. When thinking recoils upon itself, when it inquires as to the truth of its own movement, it discovers a force that overtakes and subverts it. What is most interesting in the "Nietzsche case" is that Nietzsche is the one in which this move- ment of thought will be dramatized: the actor who is both a teacher and the fortuitous occasion for an audacious experiment. The expression of this willed and fortuitous event - thisfatum - is the doctrine of eternal return, which expresses the fracturing that draws thought back to itself and so into the qualitatively new shape of a tortured circle. Klossowski writes of Nietzsche, This academic, trained in the disciplines of science in order to teach and to train others, found himself compelled to teach the unteachable. What is un- teachable are those moments when existence, escaping from the delimitations that produce the notions of history and morality, as well as the practical be- havior derived from them, is shown to be given back to itself with no other goal than that of returning to itself. All things then appear at once new and very old; everything is possible and everything is immediately impossible; and there are only two courses open to consciousness: either to keep silent or to speak; either to do nothing, or to act so as to imprint on one's everyday quotidian ambiance the character of existence given back to itself; either to lose itself in existence or to reproduce it. [NPP 84] Klossowski emphasizes that Nietzsche, this professor of philology at Basel "and thus an academic with absolutely certain pedagogical ambitions" [83], was nonetheless led by chance to an experience that overwhelms communication. This is not, however, an objective state of affairs but rather the fable that Nietzsche tells of himself: "by describ- ing himself as a convalescent who had suffered from the unresolved nihilism of his own era and who had resolved this nihilism, to the point where he was able to restore to the notion offatum its full force. He had grasped the very ground of existence, lived as fortuitous" [84]. The Gay Science is the first fruit of this convalescence, the expres- sion of the resolution of the nihilism of his age that it fell to him, by fate, to write. This expression is by no means the mere enunciation of an allegorical tale. As Klossowski emphasizes, for Nietzsche to have resolved the problem of nihilism, for Zarathustra to be created, the sort of existence that is commensurate with the notion of fate must be grasped. Nihilism is resolved by Nietzsche's doctrine of eternal return only insofar as this doctrine emerges from consciousness's experience of its own power of thought as a power of creation and revelation rather than mediation. On the one hand, hints of this experience are found in certain experiences proper to art and religion- a striking parallel with Hegel - but these experiences conflict with the sentiments of Nietzsche the professor. Nietzsche's convalescence is a sort of strug- gle between reason and rapture, between the force of thinking and the dynamics of the thought to which it gives rise. This struggle is not so much resolved as it is externalized in the character of Zarathustra, whose creation marks the end of Nietzsche's convales- cence. In Zarathustra, Nietzsche achieves the expression of the double form of fate and fable. "Fable, fabula, comes from the Latin verb fari, which means both "to predict" and "to rave," to predict fate and to rave;fatum, fate, is also the past participle offari" [88]. In this etymology is the link between fabulation and eternal return. In narrating a story of the world as fable, and no longer with a concern for the truth as a mediating function, thinking simultaneously gives expression to its own singular and fatal par- ticularity and to the irreducible status of this particularity as the law of existence. "Thus diacritics / summer 2005 39</page><page sequence="19">when we say that the world has become fable, we are also saying that it is afatum; one raves, but in raving one foretells and predicts fate" [88]. In the work of fabulation, thinking shows its contingent particularity, whose only ground for existence is the play of fate. For Klossowski, the discovery of fabulation as a response to the problem of nihil- ism is achieved by Nietzsche in and through his convalescence. This convalescence, this withdrawal, is a form of forgetting, a making of forgetting into a positive function of thinking that prepares the way for creation. In willing the forgetting of the present, Nietzsche artfully takes up the past but, again, as a fable. Nietzsche does not turn away from the world toward some objectively existent but temporally remote period of time; rather he thinks the past in and as his endurance of nihilism: "in forgetting, the past is remembered [sous-vient ai] by humans as their future, which takes the figure of the past" [89]. The eternal return is thus a doctrine offered specifically to the problem of nihilism, to the problem that requires the forgetful recoil of thinking. Nihilism calls for and is even constituted by a forgetting that returns as fate, as Zarathustra's "mission," which is "to give a new meaning and a new will to men in a world that he is necessarily going to recreate" [89]. The fateful fabulation of the past is also a prediction. However, Zarathustra himself is a part of a fable, or rather Nietzsche returns from his convalescence not only having accomplished the elimination of the true world but having fundamentally disrupted, or rather recreated, conscious thought. Insofar as con- scious thought recoils upon the flux of impulsive forces in its attempt to think its own ground, the problem that organizes Nietzsche's discussion of consciousness in The Gay Science is how conscious thought can preserve its distinctive identity in thinking multiplicity. How can the flux of pathos be thought in such a way that thought is not overcome or subverted? "In other words: How could he possess his pathos knowingly insofar as the pathos would be an apprehension of existence returning upon itself?" [94]. How can the eternal return be experienced by a consciousness, and thus also be capable of being taught? This is the question that orients Nietzsche's concern with es- caping from what he calls "the spirit of gravity." By the "consciousness" of "conscious thought" Nietzsche means simply the aspi- ration to truth whose evolution is given in "How the True World Ends by Becoming Fable." A necessary correlate of this aspiration is a substantial identity whose determi- nacy is guaranteed by a single, absolute principle or divinity. According to Nietzsche, the fact that consciousness leads the organism into so many dangers and dead ends shows that this faculty is a recent development in the course of organic life. For it to persist at all, consciousness must have been adapted to the other impulsive forces of the organism. Organic life formed the notion of consciousness as a substance: the notion of the free and autonomous subject. It is this substantial consciousness that, disavowing its origin in the flux of impulsive life as a condition for its own preservation, developed logic as the set of rules that facilitate its stable endurance, as well as language, which is the expression of this endurance, the expressive constitution and preservation of consciousness. In language, the "antivital aspiration" that is expressed in consciousness again comes to the fore as consciousness strives for a language that would preserve it from impulsive disruption. Here, however, it is logical reason-originally produced as a compromise between consciousness and the other impulses that threatened to over- whelm it-that takes the side of consciousness and constitutes habits of thinking whose utility for the survival of the organism comes to establish their status as true. The pin- nacle of this development of logical reason is found in the Stoicism of the Eleatics, whose conception of the immutable substantiality of reason - itself an error- appeared sufficient to incorporate impulsive life. With this error of the Eleatics, however, new 40</page><page sequence="20">powers of consciousness are able to develop. For the Eleatics it was possible and even inevitable that contradictory propositions would confront each other. In such a case the question of the usefulness of each proposition to life becomes a matter for contention, and, in this contention, the various instincts that initially were opposed to the conserva- tive power of consciousness are subordinated to it. It is here that consciousness enters the crisis to which philosophy must respond. The question is whether the aspiration to truth can indeed be brought into accord with the flux of impulsive forces or, as Klos- sowski phrases it, whether with this experiment one might bring about a reconciliation of consciousness and the unconscious [94]. It is in this way that nihilism may be under- stood not only as an existential exhaustion but also as a problem of language, because it is only with the loss of the true and apparent worlds that language comes to be thought of as an expression of the recoiling of thinking upon itself. Klossowski makes this connection between the problem of nihilism and language explicit when he cites the New Testament in order to illustrate the tension between the impulsive forces and consciousness that seeks to bring these forces to language in order to render conscious the unconscious flux from which it arises. As the Apostle said: All things that are condemned are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light. How to manifest without con- demning? How can an obscure force be made manifest without condemning itself to be illuminated? Could there not be a light that is not a condemnation of the shadows? Pathos knows, no doubt, but we cannot share in its mode of knowing except through this condemnation: "Take no part in the unfruitful works of the shadows," said the Apostle. Nevertheless, it is written that "the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness did not receive it." The light wanted to be received by the shadows; there is thus a moment when the light is a condemnation, and there is a moment when the light seeks to be received by the shadows. [97-98] The power of simulation both drives consciousness to express unconscious impulses in language and frustrates this expression through the sheer multiplicity of this un- conscious flux. For language was produced exclusively by that aspect of conscious- ness that struggled against its dissolution into impulsive forces by constituting itself as the substantial goal of this struggle. For Klossowski "[e]very conscious thought looks forward, identifying itself with a goal that it posits before itself as its own definition" [98]. What, then, can be said of that part of the finite existent that is unconscious? "By the individual, by the personal, by the most essential part of ourselves, Nietzsche in no way means what is generally understood by the term 'individualism"' [99]. It is not a matter of juxtaposing an "authentic" self with the self of the herd. As Klossowski notes, such a concern for authenticity is itself symptomatic of the goal-oriented structure of conscious thought. Rather, the difference between consciousness and the unconscious forces is to be found at the level of their structure or constitution. Consciousness, which comes to expression in language, is organized by a goal that works to ensure its con- stancy. Unconscious forces are therefore those forces distinguishable by the fact that they are not organized by a goal yet retain the characteristics of forces. All impulsive forces obtain their adequate expression in their simple, needful discharge against each other-this is one aspect of will to power. Consciousness, itself originally an impulsive force, arises amidst this general conflict as a will for preservation--the other aspect of will to power. Taken together, the terms that compose "will to power" are seen to be in tension with each other, one seeking expenditure in struggles with other forces diacritics / summer 2005 41</page><page sequence="21">-q ?-i or:i~i-:: :ii- 8 ~ ::":, ftmi i-ii :::.::i :-'''''i':i .: -x e IX. :::~ ::::? id : 4 ...........

Inherently opposed by every other force, consciousness is able to survive only by falsifying its expression and positing the stability that is its goal. In its attempts to articulate this goal as itself, consciousness is eventually led to the point of attempting to articulate its goal as the flux of its own ground, which is con- stituted by the will-not the goals-of impulsive forces. In bringing these forces to expression, consciousness replaces the will with goals. In this way each impulse attains expression, but at the price of hiding the interplay of the forces that constitutes the unconscious. The expression or image of the need that reflects its transformation into a goal ensures that despite the intensity of a particular impulse, any glimpse of unconscious life that is offered to conscious thought is only ever fragmentary. Klossowski emphasizes, however, that the necessity with which the impulse forces itself into conscious expression constitutes a sort of trace of the uncon- scious need, and this necessity is what consciousness is compelled to think in its recoil. The imperative, but simultaneously aimless, force of the impulsive life of conscious- ness-what is sometimes comprehended under the heading of "emotional life"-is a perpetual incitement to the subreptive disclosure of the origin of consciousness. "To suffer this necessity is one thing; it is quite another thing to adhere to it as a law; and still another thing to formulate this law in the image of a circle" [102]. The doctrine of eternal return is thus figured here as the irreconcilable confrontation of the aspiration to truth with the impulsive flux from which it arose. To will eternal return is therefore to will not only a reversal of conscious and unconscious, but the unconscious reversal of the conscious reversal of the unconscious. By giving expression to the doctrine of eternal return, however, is it not thereby falsified by being determined according to the language of consciousness, a language with which it is irreconcilable? To use the language of the first aphorism of The Gay Sci- ence, which Klossowski cites at length: is Nietzsche condemned to act out the tragedy of the "moral doctor" who obscures the strife of impulsive life behind the articulation of a goal (the thought of eternal return) that draws every impulsive force into an orderly array around itself? In order to resolve this difficulty, Klossowski offers a hypothesis concerning the relation between will to power and eternal return. Taken singly, neither of these principles is capable of grounding an imperative or of organizing a meaning. Only when eternal return has been absorbed back into the impulsive flux that is will to power can both attain a degree of consistency. The two principles form Nietzsche's "antinomy," neither one capable of grounding thought. "The lived experience is thus entirely implicit in a contemplation where the will is completely absorbed in an exis- tence rendered to itself- so that the will to power is simply an attribute of existence, which wills itself only insofar as it is [106]. The will, which implicitly posits the lim- its that it contests, and power, the expression of the polyphonic contestation of these limits, are both "absorbed" in the thought of eternal return. A tragedy for dialectics, a comedy for the thought that wills the "transvaluation of all values," this new thought is the parodic inversion of the aspiration to truth- an inversion whose contemplation may, in fact, be the truth. This new possibility for thought begins with Nietzsche's claim that "Art is a higher value than truth" [106]. Inasmuch as error has been shown to consist of giving form to impulsive forces, art is the formulation of a rule that proscribes the affirmative and knowing expression of error. Klossowski writes: "as soon as error creates forms, it goes without saying that art must effectively become that domain where willed error inaugurates a rule of the game. Just as it is contradictory to give a practical applica- tion of truth as error, so it appears that, in this domain of the game par excellence which is art, imposture constitutes a legitimate activity in accord with the reason of diacritics / summer 2005 43</page><page sequence="23">fiction" [106]; and further on, following a consideration of Nietzsche's attitude toward the Church, respecting it as an artistic construct, "[i]n the rationality of simulacra, it is willed error that provides an account of that existence whose very essence lies in the truth that conceals itself, that refuses itself" [108]. Because the valorization of the willed error is an affirmation of the difficulty en- countered by thought in its recoiling, it provides an account of the game of existence played by the finite individual. "We believe we choose freely to be what we are, but not being what we are, we are in fact constrained to play a role-and thus to play the role of what we are outside ourselves. We are never where we are, but always where we are only the actor of this other that we are" [108-09]. Thus one is fated to play a role--damned to consciousness--but this fate can be affirmed as a role, as an opportu- nity for masks to be donned and discarded. To play the actor is to affirm the inversion of consciousness as an inversion and, in so doing, "[w]hat one dissimulates is the fact that one is nothing other than existence, and one dissimulates the fact that the role one plays refers to existence itself" [109]. This is the truth of the case of Nietzsche: the dis- simulation of a physician of culture perpetrated by the fortuitous expression of forces. It cannot be the case that simulation is reducible to an expressive account of the unconscious. Such a linguistic avenue has already been closed off. For Klossowski, the disclosive power of simulation is contained in Nietzsche's famous statement: "God is dead." "God is dead does not mean that the divinity ceases to act as a clarification of existence, but rather that the absolute guarantee of the identity of the responsible self vanishes from the horizon of Nietzsche's consciousness, which in turn merges with this disappearance" [111]. In affirming the inversion of the essential part of consciousness, Nietzsche plays at roles to the point that these roles supersede any sense of identity. The inversion of the roles is taken seriously insofar as they are roles but no longer in relation to a lost essence and, in this parody, the fortuitous comes to appear as necessity, as the wheel of fortune. When Nietzsche claims that he is all the names in history, he affirms the multiplicity of the unconscious impulsive forces by taking on the roles of specific relations of forces. Being, then, is no longer the tragicomic reconciliation of a substance sundered from itself. The polytheism that emerges from Klossowski's reading of the eternal re- turn is not the self-sufficiency of the human in its liberation from monotheism. Such a conception implicitly advocates constancy and stability, while the lesson of eternal return taught by the case of Nietzsche is the affirmation of all the differential powers of metamorphosis that have been systematically excluded by consciousness. If this multiplication of the powers of metamorphosis is polytheistic, this cannot be because consciousness "recognizes" divinities. Rather, in its fabulation, the contemplation of existence has rendered the world and thought indistinct, and the multiple constellations of impulsive forces are at once so many silent narrations of what Klossowski refers to as "regions that are supra- or infra-worldly" [113]. This world of simulation is nothing other than will to power, which "is simply another term for this set of tendencies and constitutes the universal capacity for meta- morphosis" [114]. As the universal aptitude for metamorphosis, will to power is at once a will to creation, and so a will to destruction, and also a will to adoration, a will for the eternalization of each creation. But this will to power, this will to adore, is nothing other than the expression of the necessity of consciousness. "For this reason, he [man] would not know how to either obey or believe in the values he deliberately creates, were it not a matter of the very simulacra of his need for eternity" [114]. Eternal return, as the law of simulation, the necessary counterpart to will to power, is therefore only the simulation of a doctrine, an inversion whose affirmation dissolves the seriousness of this doctrine and the simulacra. This affirmation is not comedy but laughter, irreduc- 44</page><page sequence="24">ible to resolution or reconciliation. In his creative expression of the doctrine of eternal return, Zarathustra is shown to fail to give expression to the will to creation. Finally, however, by taking simulation seriously in the creative contemplation of eternal return, Zarathustra plays upon this doctrine--and upon all doctrines--and thereby affirms the impulsive laughter that shocks consciousness into new constellations of thought.
