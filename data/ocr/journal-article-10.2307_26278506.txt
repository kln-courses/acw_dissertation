<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEINBECK'S IMAGE OF MAN AND HIS DECLINE AS A WRITER1 Peter Lisca Notwithstanding the flattering reviews, the financial triumphs of fre quent selection by the Book of the Month Club, the assertions of greatness on dust-jackets, and even his recent Nobel Prize for Litera ture, Steinbeck's decline as a writer of major or even serious fiction is a phenomenon which has been asserted often enough to need no emphasis here. In the most recent book about Steinbeck, out of 141 pages of textual analysis only 20 pages are devoted to his last five books, covering a period of 12 years, one-third of his writing career.2 A very recent article reflects the same opinion, which in fact has been current since the first full-length study in 1958.3 Any student who follows Steinbeck's career must remark not only the technical inconsequences of his recent fiction, but also the undy namic and fragmentary nature of his "image of man." It would be surprising if these two aspects were not related. In general, the "barbaric yawp" of Whitman and the dry irony of Hemingway, to lump their various qualities into one epithet, may not be the inevitable techniques for their respective images o£ man, but they are surely the consequent techniques of those images. Similarly, in general, Stein beck's choices of mythical structure, legend, protagonist, imagery, and even prose style are the consequences of possessing a certain image of man for which he feels these particular techniques are necessary or adequate vehicles. Because of this organic relationship it is logical to assume that the study of one of these terms in Steinbeck will illumi nate the other also. Steinbeck's image of man can be studied conveniently under four conventional aspects: man's relationship to a physical world in which he finds himself; man's relationship to a metaphysical world which may be; man's relationship to a social world which he creates; "The following paper was read as part of the program on "The American Novel and the Image of Man" during the NCTE meeting in Cleveland, November 27, 1964.

The full-length study is my The Wide World of John Steinbeck (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1958). 3</page><page sequence="2">and finally, man as a distinct and ideal individual. In Steinbeck's best work these various facets of his image of man find expression in each of the technical aspects listed above—the particular applica tion of myth, legend, protagonist, imagery, prose style. In his major work, such as In Dubious Battle and The Grapes of Wrath, so ade quate are these techniques that their relationship to his image of man is like the relationship of form and content—ultimately indistin guishable. In his novels up to Burning Bright (1950) Steinbeck's physical image of man is of an animal capable of reason, but otherwise not clearly distinguishable except in the denotations of his genus and species. Man may pursue goals a little more abstract than those pursued by other species, but the motivations for such pursuits are not essentially different. In Cup of Gold, his very first novel, Stein beck speculates that his youthful hero's yearning to leave Wales and seek his fortune in the world "was a desire for a thing he could not name. Perhaps the same force moved him which collected the birds into exploring parties and made the animals sniff up-wind for the scent of winter." Nor does Steinbeck shrink from the logic of extend ing this understanding of individual motivation to man in general: When two crayfish meet, they usually fight. One would say that perhaps they might not at a future time, but without some mutation it is not likely that they will lose this trait. And perhaps our species is not likely to forego war without some psychic mutation which at present, at least, does not seem imminent. And if one places the blame for killing and destroying on economic insecurity, on inequality, on injustice, he is simply stating the proposition in another way. We have what we are. Perhaps the crayfish feels the itch of jealousy, or perhaps he is sexually insecure. The effect is that he fights.4 This statement is merely the explicit setting forth of a physical image of man which can be copiously illustrated from the novels preceding it: Joseph Wayne's reflections on the ecological relation ship of eels, pigs, mountain lions and man in To A God Unknown, Grandfather's statements about the motivations of the pioneers in The Red Pony and Doc Burton's explanations of mob action in In Dubious Battle. When, therefore, Steinbeck's figurative language describing man's actions is biological in its terms, or when he juxtaposes a paragraph depicting human rapacity with a paragraph describing a school of fish being herded and slaughtered by larger fish while the sea birds scream and dive to pick up the fragments, he is not merely "decorat ing" the novel. He is not even condemning. Rather, this imagery is the consequent, objective expression of his physical image of man. ♦John Steinbeck, Se a of Cortez (New York: The Viking Press, 1941), p. 17. MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">Steinbeck's metaphysical image of man is the logical dependent of this physical image. Having accepted man as animal, he refuses, in those novels prior to Burning Bright, to subject him to some spe cial "bearded, interstellar dictator." Instead, he posits a "psycho physiological warp" in which are related the vestigial gill slits of the human foetus and the preponderantly aquatic symbols of the unconscious. Contemplating the awesome physical order of nature does not lead to positing some anthropomorphic intelligence behind it, but only to a reverance of the order itself. This, results in re-creat ing on a sophisticated level the primitive myths of animism and bio logical pantheism. Although Joseph Wayne in To A God Unknown makes offerings to an oak tree and although the old hermit who lives by the sea every day sacrifices some small animal to the setting sun, they do not do so to propitiate any metaphysical, omniscent intelli gence. "I do it for myself. I can't tell that it doesn't help the sun. But it is for me," explains the hermit. And when Joseph sacrifices himself on the rock altar so that his land may have rain, he feels his body "grow huge and light. It rose into the sky, and out of it came the streaking rain. 'I should have known,' he whispered, 'I am the rain.' And yet he looked dully down the mountains of his body where the hills fell to an abyss. ... He saw his hills grow dark with moisture. . . 'I am the land,' he said, 'and I am the rain. The grass will grow out of me in a little while.' " To A God Unknown is a strange novel, but in a less striking form the metaphysical speculations of that novel are continued in subse quent works. In Tortilla Flat, Pilon sees some birds flying across "the forehead of God," and prays to "Our Father who art in Nature." "All that lives is holy," says Jim Casy in The Grapes of Wrath, and "Maybe all men got one big soul ever'body's a part of." Even as late as The Pearl, Steinbeck is able to invest his simple fable with tragedy by setting it in the context of a biological world order concerned only with perpetuating itself and completely oblivious to personality or soul (the "Pearl of Great Price"). The remaining two aspects of Steinbeck's earlier image of man, his social order and his concept of ideal character, are, like his metaphysical speculations, derived from an image of man as entirely accountable in naturalistic terms. The ideal student of man's social history is an ecologist, and man's various social actions can be under stood in terms of recurring forms which give his history a continuity. The Arthurian legends can be used to find structure in the lives of the residents of Tortilla Flat. The Old Testament can be used to structure and understand the mass migrations out of the dust bowl; STEINBECK'S IMAGE OF MAN 5</page><page sequence="4">the New Testament provides the archetype for Jim Casy and Juan Chicoy. The legends of Faust and the legends of the Holy Grail combine to give symbolic structure to Cup of Gold. Not only the title, but the theme of intestinal division in In Dubious Battle are provided by the epic action of Paradise Lost. The theme of Everyman is used in The Wayward Bus. Thus myth and legend contain pos sible patterns of social action, and man's social continuity is estab lished in the recurrence of these patterns. Furthermore, Steinbeck projects each of these patterns through its particular prose style: the detached, scientific prose a biologist might use to describe the social life of animals; the language of the Old Testament; the prose of the Mort D'Arthur adapted to the purposes of mock-epic; the par able style of the New Testament. Finally, there is Steinbeck's concept of the ideal man, who appears in some of his aspects under such varied guises as Doc Burton of In Dubious Battle, Billy Buck of The Red Pony, and Juan Chicoy of The Wayward Bus—all of whom, no matter what their differences, have the ability to transcend their individuality and see "the whole picture." The ideal man appears fully developed, however, only once: as Doc of Cannery Row. Through his profession of marine biologist Doc is closer than the others to the naturalistic basis of Steinbeck's image of man. Yet he is also the most humane of Stein beck's protagonists. Just as Steinbeck found it possible to portray an ultimately naturalistic image of man through the myths and legends of Western culture, so Doc emerges in the religious role of a God to the inhabitants of Cannery Row, a God who finds in the naturalistic order opportunity for bravery, kindness, beauty, com passion. For as Christ did not lose His divinity for being also a man, so Doc does not lose these human traits for being also a part of the natural order. "I believe that man is a double thing," writes Steinbeck, "a group animal and at the same time an individual. And it occurs to me that he cannot successfully be the second until he has fulfilled the first."5 Just as by accepting his part as a group animal he finds his individuality, so by accepting his role in the naturalistic order, thinking of himself as a species, he finds his true divinity: "For species are only commas in a sentence . . . each species is at once the point and base of a pyramid . . . groups melt into ecological groups until the time when what we know as life meets and enters what we think of as non-life ... all things are one thing and that one thing is all things—plankton, a shimmering phosphores 6 John Steinbeck, "Some Thoughts on Juvenile Delinquency," Saturday Review, XXXVIII (May 28, 1955), p. 22. MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">cence on the sea and the spinning planets and an expanding universe, all bound together by the elastic string of time."6 It is this consistency among the various aspects of Steinbeck's image of man, and the organic relationship between these aspects and the techniques of his fiction, along lines briefly sketched here, that give Steinbeck's earlier work substance and viability. Beginning, however, with Burning Bright (1950), and surely reach ing some absolute impasse in The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), as his latest book, Travels with Charley, makes clear, Steinbeck has been attempting a reconstruction of his image of man. His dedica tion to this is neatly recorded in the journal he started to keep at this time. The writer must not "celebrate the destruction of the spirit," wrote Steinbeck, but must take as his "duty" instead "to lift up, to extend, to encourage . . . and how any despairing or negative approach can pretend to be literature, I do not know." The journal continues with the following sentence, which was later incorporated into East of Eden as among the last words of Samuel Hamilton: "It is true that we are weak and sick and ugly and quarrelsome but if that is all we ever were, we would, milleniums ago have disappeared from the face of the earth and a few remnants of fossilized jawbones, a few teeth in strata of limestone would be the only mark our species would have left on the earth." This is perhaps the last time Stein beck was able to use his naturalistic imagery so surely. As a testa ment of faith in mankind this is a very moving statement. But as an image of man for projection in terms of art it has no inherent superiority over his earlier, more strictly biological image of man, and as a matter of fact the presence of this new testament in the novels which followed was accompanied by certain serious failures in his art. In his next book, the play-novelette Burning Bright, Steinbeck tries to "universalize" the theme that all men are brothers to each other and fathers to every child by shifting the scene and circumstan tial identity of the characters in each act, which simply has the effect of a gimmick. In The Grapes of Wrath and In Dubious Battle, Steinbeck had been able to make even the looseness of their endings an aspect of organic form: "A story of the life of a man ends with his death," he wrote his agents in 1935, "but where can you end a story of man-movement that has no end. No matter where you stop there is always more to come. I have tried to indicate this by stop ping on a high point but it is by no means an ending." Perhaps more telling than this aspect of arbitrary form in Burning Bright 'Sea of Cortez, pp. 216-217. STEINBECK S IMAGE OF MAN</page><page sequence="6">is the terrible fate of Victor. After being used as a stud by Mordeen to provide herself with a child to present to her sterile husband as his own, he is hit "a crunching blow on the head" by Friend Ed and dumped overboard to drown, so that he cannot tell her husband the truth. In a novel oriented toward Steinbeck's earlier, biological image of man, such a shocking incident might very well have been absorbed. In many species of insects and some vertebrates the female destroys the male after copulation. Steinbeck might have linked such an incident into his great biological chain of being, perhaps as evidence of the ubiquitous female drive to procreate and protect at all cost her offspring. But in the predominantly Christian image of man which actually tries to inform Burning Bright such an inci dent becomes a horror with no artistic function and actually works to destroy the image of man which is everywhere else being asserted. This failure of Steinbeck's new image of man to find expression in suitable aspects of form is equally painful in his next novel, East of Eden. In this novel Steinbeck set himself to develop another facet of his new image of man—his free will, his ability to triumph over moral evil, a far different struggle than the effort to master the biological evils of hunger and insecurity. The failure of form was obvious even to those critics who were inclined to give an overall favorable judgment. Thus Joseph Wood Krutch: "On the highest level the question is this: Does the fable really carry the thesis; is the moral implicit in or merely imposed upon the story: has the author created a myth or merely moralize a tale?"7 Similarly, Mark Schorer remarked upon "the gap between speculative statement and novelistic presentation."8 There were many aspects of this gap, such as the confusion of narrative point of view and the trite or incredible invention of character and incident. Unable to use his biological metaphors to illustrate or sustain the Christian ethic, Steinbeck resorts to purely decorative, incongruous or trite figures of speech such as, ". . . Tom got into a book, crawled and groveled between the covers, tunneled like a mole among the thoughts and came up with the book all over his face and hands"; or, "Tom raged crazily through the hills like a lion in horrible pain"; or, "Liza Hamilton, her cheeks flaming red, moved like a caged leopard in front of the stove." This degeneration of language is obvious even in the straight forward descriptive passages, which are rococo or simply flaccid. When in 1950, before the publication of Burning Bright and East 7 "John Steinbeck's Dramatic Tale of Three Generations," New York Herald Tribune Weekly Book Review, September 21, 1952, p. 1. 6 "A Dark and Violent Steinbeck Novel," The New York Times Book Review, Septem ber 21, 1952, p. 22. MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">of Eden, Steinbeck was asked by his editor if he would like to make a play out of Cannery Row, he replied, "I'm not going to do it. . . . I have finished that whole phase." Just how finished that whole phase was is evident in the first two sentences of Sweet Thursday (a sequel to Cannery Row published after East of Eden) which is introduced by the announcement of Mack, a major character of Cannery Row: "I ain't never been satisfied with that book Cannery Row. I would have went about it different." And "different" Stein beck goes about it. In the earlier book, his biological orientation had provided some powerful images of inexorable Time (the tides) and Fate (the rattlesnake staring with his dusty eyes at the white mice; the frantic life of the tide pools). Such images were used contra puntally to enforce the themes of mutability and carpe diem, summed up in the quotations from the Sanscrit Black Marigolds. Thus Can nery Row achieves, in addition to its broad comedy, a genuine sense of pathos, though not tragedy. Even the organization of the book was announced in the preface as analogous to the process of collecting very delicate marine organisms. But the new humanistic image of man in Sweet Thursday, operating on essentially the same characters and kinds of situations generates only the slickest kind of slapstick, out of which was produced with fair success on Broadway a musical comedy called Pipe Dream. What had before remained sentiment, stiffened by the underlying biological metaphor, when exposed to the new image of man melted into sentimentality, whether of char acter, situation, or language. The "frothy extravaganza," as the publishers called it, which fol lowed this "pipe dream," The Short Reign of Pippin IV, is an attempt at social satire. But Steinbeck's own disclaimer of serious intent does not really justify the sophomoric chaos of its incidents and language. One can search out various remnants of Steinbeck's old techniques. There is for example the Merlin of his first novel, via the Old Hermit of To A God Unknown, via The Pirate of Tortilla Flat, via the crackpot Seer of Sweet Thursday, now a lonely old man who spends his time rescuing those statues which his opposites, the "pusher-inners" keep throwing into the moat. He also echoes Casy of The Grapes of Wrath when he says, "There's just people—just what people do." But whereas for Casy this was part of a more complex faith which he had learned with difficulty, for which he gave his life, and which is an important aspect of the novel's meaning, in this old man it is merely a curiosity. Also, the protagonist is a scientist of sorts, but more in the style of Sweet Thursday than of In Dubious Battle or Cannery Row. The old metaphysical notions of race mem steinbeck's image of man 9</page><page sequence="8">ory and subliminal drives, so operative in the early novels and bril liantly symbolized in the turtle of The Grapes of Wrath, are present here in some remarks about the behavior of a city-bred pointer when first turned loose in the country. All these techniques have the effect of parodies. They are no longer organically functional or even mean ingful in the new context. The Winter of Our Discontent offers the most recent evidence that Steinbeck has not yet found some new image of man charged with enough significance as to create a philosophical and esthetic order in his fiction. This last novel has as its central theme the breakdown and practical obsolescence in our American culture of certain tradi tionally admired characteristics. The image of man, or, more ac curately, the image of the American, which emerges is one of dis honesty, laziness, opportunism and cynicism on all levels—personal, professional, social. But this condemnation, much more thorough than that in The Wayward Bus, fails to project itself in significant forms. Some attempt is made to use the Easter theme and to symbolize the firm moral fabric of the American past. But these formal aspects fail to mold the novel's materials, consisting of reworked clichés and stereotyped situations. In this unjelled mass can still be found vestigial bits and fragments of the old techniques. Certainly, Margie, in the role of Steinbeck's virtuous whore is one of these, as is Danny Taylor in the role of the local wise hermit, as is Marullo in the role of the local storekeeper. There is also in the stone talisman of wonderful powers a suggestion of the mystique of extra-sensory perception, and in the seashore cave a reminiscence of several womb like caves in Steinbeck's previous work. But these old bottles simply will not hold Steinbeck's new wine. Looking over Steinbeck's career, one is forced to accept a paradox. His earlier novels, although based on an image of man almost purely biological and naturalistic, succeed in exploring and giving new significance to those aspects which in the hands of earlier naturalistic writers had resulted only in the degrading of man. Furthermore, this biological image of man created for itself techniques and aspects of form capable of conveying this image of man with esthetic power and conviction. On the other hand, when Steinbeck abandons his earlier viewpoint and attempts to project an image of man based on such more conventional notions as Christian morality and ethical integrity he cannot seem to say anything significant. And, deprived of pervasive naturalistic metaphor, the formal qualities of that fiction become no better, and in some ways inferior, to those of many writers whose endowments are not nearly so formidable as his own. 10</page></plain_text>
