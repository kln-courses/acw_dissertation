<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROTO-OCEANIC TERMS FOR 'PERSON': A PROBLEM IN SEMANTIC RECONSTRUCTION by Andrew Pawley University of Auckland 1. THE PROBLEM Casual inspection yields at least five distinct cognate sets each pointing to a Proto-Oceanic (POO reconstruction meaning something like 'person, human being'.1 Each reconstruction has reflexes with this meaning in at least one and usually several of the putative first-order subgroups of Oceanic. The question is, did POC have several synonyms meaning 'person' or did some or all of these etyma differ in meaning? An examination of the evidence will lead us, incidentally. to some observations about the morphological marking of plural number in terms for categories of person, and to a conclusion about the phonemic status of vowel length in POC.2 Proto-Oceanic is the name given to the ancestor of a subgroup of Austronesian (AN) languages whose membership comprises Polynesian. Nuclear Micronesian, and all the AN languages of Melanesia spoken east of 1 36? E (near Sarera Bay. at the western end of New Guinea). In spite of its size - more than 400 languages, or about half the total membership of the AN family - Oceanic is probably no more than a third or fourth order branch of AN. Its immediate relatives are to be found in eastern Indonesia. More distantly related are the remaining languages of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, and the Philippines; the AN languages of Formosa appear to be still more distant, forming one or more first-order branches coordinate with the rest of Austronesian.3 The Austronesian expansion into the Pacific and Indian Oceans was the first of two great periods of maritime colonisation in human history, the other being the European expansion after Columbus. Both archaeological and linguistic evidence indicate that Austronesian speakers entered northwest Melanesia from Indonesia, before 2000 B.C. Proto-Oceanic evidently developed in northwest Melanesia, but by 1500 B.C. Oceanic speakers had colonised most of the islands of central and southern Melanesia and had reached as far east as Fiji and Western Polynesia.4 One consequence of this rapid dispersal was the fragmentation of Oceanic into some 20 or more subgroups in Melanesia which appear to have no immediate ancestor in common closer than Proto-Oceanic. This genetic fragmentation, together with the wide geographic dispersal of subgroups, is a boon to the comparative linguist; he has a large number of (probably) independent witnesses to draw on in doing reconstructions of Proto-Oceanic. He can also draw on external witnesses, the non-Oceanic AN languages. At present the number of etyma that have been attributed to POC is on the</page><page sequence="2">93 order of 1500-2000. Among these are the forms, sometimes given as *tau, *tamwata, *tamwane, *kai and *tinoni, all of which have reflexes meaning 'person, human being', as for example: *tau Arosi au 'man*, Motu tau 'male', tau-nimanima 'human being', Kuanua to 'prefix to names of males', Dobuan tau-na 'he, she*, Muyuw tou-ma 'dead person', Kove tau 'self, Molima to- 'the one who, the person who', Samoan t?u/pou 'title of village ceremonial maiden*, tau/le'ale'a 'unfitted man*. *tamwata Fijian tamata Tongan tangata Hawaiian kanaka 'person*, Gedaged tamol 'man, male, human being', Dobuan tomota Manam tamoata 'man, person', Trukese aramas 'person, lineage mate, friend, commoner'. *tamwane Mae-Morae (Epi, C. Vanuatu) tEman 'person', Wayan (Western Fijian) tagwane, Tongan ta'ane 'male, man'. *kai Kwaio (Malalta) ai 'person'. Mota gai 'fellow! (vocative)'. Standard Fijian kai. Western Fijian koi 'prefix indicating native of a place', Maori kai- 'verbal prefix indicating a human agent*. *tinoni Roviana tinoni-na 'people', Arosi inoni, Nggela tinoni 'man, human being', Kia noni, Torau tioni 'man'. At least three explanations might be offered to account for these comparisons: (1 ) Some (or all) of the etyma were present In POC, as synonyms. (2) Some (or all) were present in POC, but differed in meaning. (3) Some (or all) represent an interstage later than POC, or belonged to different dialect regions of POC. Our argument will be that the first four contrasted in meaning in POC and that the fifth belonged either to an eastern dialect area of POC or to a later stage. 2. THE EVIDENCE 2.1 *TAU. The two reconstructions most widely reflected in Oceanic languages are *tau and Mamwata. Of these, *tamwata is far more often associated with the meaning 'person'. *tau often appears in other senses, usually 'man' or 'male person', sometimes 'self, 'one who (does or is associated with something)' or 'owner*. Only In a few languages is a reflex of *tau the ordinary word for 'person*. Yet a conjunction of several kinds of evidence indicates that 'person' was the central meaning of POC *tau, and that its range of reference included ghosts and corpses as well as living human beings. The following arguments point to this conclusion. 1. PAN *Cau, from which POC *tau derives, is generally agreed to have meant 'person*. *Cau is widely reflected in this meaning among non-Oceanic languagea</page><page sequence="3">94 2. The various meanings which reflexes of *tau now have can be most plausibly derived from an original meaning 'person*, e.g. 'man', 'self, 'third person singular*, 'one who'. Furthermore, there is a much stronger candidate than *tau for the meaning 'man, male* (see 2.4). This semantic shift 'person'&gt;'man' appears to be a natural one. It has, for example, occured more than once in the Polynesian languages. While the generic meaning of reflexes of PPN * tarja ta in all Polynesian languages is 'person1, in Maori and Tongan one may use tangata to refer to a definite adult male but not to a female (as 'See that man there'). Such male bias is of course not confined to Polynesians; compare English man (i) adult male, (ii) Mankind, the human being. 3. Among Oceanic languages which do not preserve *tau as an isolable base meaning 'person*, and which have other forms for this meaning, *tau is rather widely reflected as an element in compound lexemes denoting a category of person. Generally the compound has the appearance of beng an archaism, no longer clearly analysable, in which an original element *tau was followed by a modifying base to derive a compound with more specific meaning. In Proto-Polynesian, for example, we can reconstruct:5 *taulekaleka 'undersized person, person of low status' *taupoqou 'young man or woman, young unmarried person' Mautai 'mariner, navigator, skilled fisherman* Mauquta 'landlubber' The practice of forming compounds of *tau plus modifier evidently predates POC, because a number of such compounds are indubitably of POC age and show phonological reduction as a mark of lexicalisation already (see *tamwata and *tamwaqane in 2.2 and 2.4 below). What is significant about the Polynesian forms is that they appear to include certain new formations, compounds containing *tau in the sense of 'person* that postdate POC. In certain contemporary Polynesian languages, e.g. Rennellese, tau continues to be at least semi-productive in compound noun formation in the sense of 'owner, person of a certain status or category'.6 The same is true of reflexes of *tau in certain Micronesian languages, e.g. Trukese sowu- 'proprietor of, soo- 'person', as sowu-pwpw?n 'landowner', soope 'ghost', sootupw 'not visible person, departed, dead', soom? 'corpse'. Northern Vanuatu languages also show evidence of continuing *tau as a productive formative meaning 'person* in compounds (see 2.2 and fn.7). We turn now to a form which has equally strong claims to be regarded as the ordinary word for 'person' in POC. 2.2 *TAMWATA. A form usually reconstructed as *tamwata, with a labiovelar second consonant, is widely associated with the meaning 'person' in Oceanic languages of Melanesia and Polynesia, and has possible cognates in Nuclear Micronesian. From this prototype, for instance, derive Samoan tagata, Fijian tamata Dobuan, Kiriwina tomota Sio tam?ta Manam tamoata Tami damala all meaning 'human being', and possibly also Gllbertese aomata Trukese aramata although these Micronesian forms show certain unexplained irregularities. One can hardly avoid reconstructing *tamwata alongside *tau in the meaning 'person'. The question arises, was there a difference in meaning or use between them?</page><page sequence="4">95 Capell (1943:166) pointed to non-Oceanic cognates among Sulawesi languages: Menado taumata Bentulu tomata Tagulanging toumata These suggest a pre-Oceanic form Maumata, which Capell and Dempwolff etymologised into *tau 'person* + *mata 'green, unripe'; they suggested that the compound had the meaning of 'living person'. The problem with this semantic reconstruction is that there are no contemporary Oceanic languages in which *mata is reflected in the meaning 'alive, living', and there are no languages which show a contrasting pair of the types *tau 'person', *tamwata 'living person'.7 Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that these two forms were not exact synonyms in POC. Contemporary witnesses show a range of usages which indicate that *tau could refer in POC to a dead person or to a ghost or supernatural being, while *tamwata referred to a human being in the strict sense. In Tami (Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea) damala denotes 'human being in full possession of senses and mind, free of physical affliction' (blindness, deafness or other infirmity). Any lack of these produces a mboal, glossed 'evil being*. In Mota of Vanuatu there is a contrast between tanun 'human being', tamate 'corpse; ghost, dead man in separation from his body', and tamaur 'living person*. Each of these Mota forms contains the root ta- 'person' &lt; *tau, plus a modifier nun 'real', mate 'dead', maur 'alive'. It appears that the complex form Maumate 'corpse, ghost' goes back to POC and was already lexicalised at that time. The usage is reflected in a number of different subgroups, e.g. Mota tamate (see above); Roviana (New Georgia, Solomon Is.) tomate-na 'corpse, ghost or spirit', Motu (Central Province, PNG) mase tau-na 'corpse', Molima (Milne Bay Province, PNG) tomate 'dead person', Trukese soom? 'corpse'. In these languages the compound is treated as a single lexical unit for purposes of possession and in several languages phonological reduction has obscured the compound nature of the form. Ann Chowning (p.c.) observes that Lakalai (W. Nakanai, New Britain) uses a reflex of *tau not only to mean 'person* but in a number of compounds denoting non-human but partly personified beings, including clan spirits? e.g. the sun is tau-Hahili. She suggests that the reference of *tau included all anthropomorphic beings and not only those entities counted as 'people' in English. When we examine the reflexes of *tamwata, however, we find no evidence for an extension beyond '(living) human being*. Tami damala 'healthy human being' has already been noted. In Central Pacific languages *tamwata consistently refers to a living person as opposed to a corpse or a ghost, e.g. Wayan (W. Fiji) tamata 'person', anitu 'ghost', Samoan tagata 'person', aitu 'spirit'. Further, no compounds containing *tamwata are reconstructible. This is in marked contrast to *tau, which is reconstructible in a number of compounds that evidently were already lexicalised in POC, including *taumate 'corpse, ghosf, *taupaqoRu "young person of marriageable age* (Pawley 1982), *tamwata itself, *tamwaqane or *taumaqane (see 2.4) and *tauta(n)si 'master fisherman, expert seaman' (indicated by PPN *tautai, noted in 2.1, and Trukese sowuset 'master fisherman'). While both forms probably denoted a person in POC, all the signs are that *tau was the older usage, and had a wider range of uses. *tamwata referred to human beings in their normal, living condition. *tau denoted human beings In a more general sense, a range of personal or person-1 ike statuses, including ghosts and anthropomorphic beings. *tau occurred in compounds, preceding both statives</page><page sequence="5">96 such as *mate 'dead' and *paqoRu 'young' and nouns such as *ta(n)si 'sea' and *mwaqane 'male', sometimes having the sense 'owner' or 'one characteristically associated with a place or activity'. A final note on form. Blust (1 981) points out that at least one Oceanic language reflects *taumata rather than *tamwata, indicating that the development of the labiovelar may have taken place in more than one branch of Oceanic after the breakup of POC. Given the wide distribution of the type *tamwata however, it seems likely that the latter at least coexisted with *taumata as a stylistic (or dialectal) doublet.8 2.3 *KAI(N). Cognates indicating a POC form *kai, meaning something like 'person', extend from the Solomons to Polynesia, e.g. Kwaio ai 'person'. Lau (Malaita) 'ai 'a person, individual, a woman', Mota gai 'fellow!', ra-gai 'those persons', Maori kai- 'prefix to verbs, marking agent' (e.g. kai-mahi 'worker'). Cognates have not so far been noted in northwest Melanesia, but their distribution is sufficient to attribute the reconstruction at least to an eastern dialect of POC or to a very early post-POC stage, to which *tau and *tamwata 'person' can also be attributed. Comparison of the Fijian reflexes with that of Arosi (San Cristobal) suggests that *kai had a more specialised meaning. Arosi ai means 'native, person of a place'. Eastern Fijian kai. Western Fijian koi have exactly the same meaning: a person who belongs to a place, a native or inhabitant. The agreement extends to syntactic use: the word always occurs before a following modifier which specifies the name of the place or class of people which the person belongs to, as St. Fijian kai Viti 'Fijian, native of Fiji*, kai Idia 'Indian', kai colo 'inhabitant of the interior, inland people'. In Arosi the modifier may follow directly or after the genitive ni, as ai Wango, or ai ni Wango 'Wango person, native of Wango'. If we assume that Fijian and Arosi have retained the POC meaning, a number of other comparisons fall into place. In Polynesia we find Tongan kakai 'people (collectively)', Samoan 'a'ai 'village, town', Rennellese kakai 'live, inhabit, stay (of a plural subject)'. (Partial reduplication, as Samoan no-nofo 'sit, stay (plural subject)' is a feature of many verbs having a plural subject.) With the addition of comparisons such as Tongan kai-na 'occupied by strangers', kakai-'ia 'peopled, populated' (where -na, -'ia are Stative verb derivatives), kai mu'a 'leading, principal, or more important person or people', k?i fonua 'commoner' (fonua 'land'), kainanga 'populace, people without chiefly rank' (where -nanga or -anga may be the PPN noun-derivative suffix, as Maori nono 'stay', nohoanga 'dwelling place', tanu 'bury', tanumanga 'burial'), Rennellese kainanga 'subject of a chief, kakai'anga 'settlement, inhabitants, subclan, group of people living together', we may tentatively reconstruct a series of PPN forms: *kai- (in compounds) 'inhabitant, person of a certain place or class' *kakai 'people of a place, a settlement of people' *kaina 'inhabited' (singular subject) *kainarja 'lineage or clan, people acknowledging same ancestor and chief *kainaga is (as Goodenough 1955 pointed out) an Oceanic form that goes</page><page sequence="6">97 back well beyond PPN, and wider comparison suggests that in PPN and in earlier times it referred to a high-order descent group, a clan or subclan:9 Trukese einang 'clan, people or ethnicity' Puluwat y?yln?ng 'clan' Woleai gailang (underlying /kailanga/ 'clan, tribe, tribal division' Tikopian kainanga 'clan, non-exogamous descent group consisting of several exogamous lineages' Hawaiian maka 'ainana 'populace, common people (not nobility)' Tahitian mata 'eina'a (1) 'higher order ramage', (2) 'district in which the ramage is located* Rennellese kainanga 'subject of a chief PPN *mata was a collective noun, denoting a group or series. The Hawaiian and Tongan reflexes of *kainaga, denoting the populace or common people, those without chiefly rank, can be counted as independent innovations, arising from relatively recent structural changes in Hawaiian and Tongan society towards a feudal type, such as are argued for by Sahlins (1 963). PPN society evidently continued an older Oceanic social structure in which a chief and his subjects were kinsmen, the chief of a lineage or clan being, ideally, the first-born male of the senior line.10 In certain Polynesian societies the chiefly families established themselves as a separate class, controlling or owning the land and generally not intermarrying with commoners. The antiquity of the form *kainarja, alongside the Tongan verbal form kaina 'inhabited', indicates that the POC base may have been *kain rather than *kai. POC stem-final consonants are lost In absolute word-final position in Polynesian and most other Oceanic languages, but are often preserved before the stative and noun-derivative suffixes which can be reconstructed as POC *-a and *-ana -aga, respectively. In such languages the stem-final consonant is typically reinterpreted as belonging to the suffix, as Maori tanu-manga 'burial', inu-manga 'drinking' from POC *tanum 'bury', *inum 'drink*. In the absence of cognates in those Oceanic languages that preserve finals in unsuffixed bases, we cannot determine the exact form of the reconstruction and must write it *kai(n). 2.4 *TAMWAQANE. The POC term for 'woman, female* was *papine. In contemporary Oceanic languages we frequently find a reflex of *papine in this meaning opposed to a term for 'man, male' derived from a prototype usually reconstructed as *mwane, e.g. Gilbertese aine 'female', mwane 'male*. Nggela, Bugotu vaivine 'female', mane 'male', Manam aine 'female', moane 'male*. Although reflexes of *mwane sometimes have other meanings, e.g. Wayan (W. Fijian) gwane- 'sibling of opposite sex', Samoan tua-gane 'brother of a woman', Molima moane 'spouse', the evidence strongly points to 'man, male' as the meaning, or one of the meanings of *mwane in POC. Moreover, it is clear that the pair *papine and *mwane referred to the sex of plants and animals as well as to human genders, as e.g. Arosi taga mwane 'male flower*. It is likely but less certain that the pair were also used in the senses of 'wife* and 'husband', respectively, and it is no doubt from such a usage that the Molima word moane 'spouse' derives. The reconstruction *mwane is not free of problems, however. For one thing.</page><page sequence="7">98 the phonological diversity of the forms, e.g. the Cristobal-Malaitan reflexes show the expected loss of *t, a sound shift that is probably at least two millenia old. Furthermore, there are few if any other words which can be shown to have spread across the whole of the main Solomons chain in post-POC times. More likely we are dealing with an innovation which diffused across this zone at a time when most of the languages were little differentiated. If the Solomons use of *tinoni to mean 'person' is innovative, where did the form originally come from and what did it mean? Possible cognates are found in several quarters, and these usually have the meaning 'body', 'skin' or 'trunk'. Thus, Samoan Rennellese tino 'body, trunk', Tongan sino 'body', Maori tino 'essentiality, self, reality' point to PPN *tino 'body'. In a few languages, e.g. Niuean tino 'body, flesh, a person' and Tokelauan tino 'body, a person' the reference is extended to include the idea of an individual person. Comparison with English body in the dual senses of 'flesh-and-bones* and 'a person' (somebody, nobody, a body can't get any peace here), and person in its dual senses of 'human being' and 'living human body' indicates the naturalness of such an extension. However, the Solomons forms show unexplained -ni in comparison with the Polynesian, so that it is not certain that the two cognate sets have a single origin. POC Mini- 'body, trunk (of a living person)' is a better-attested reconstruction. Reflexes occur not only in diverse New Guinea area subgroups (e.g. Gedaged, Kove, Arop tin!, Azera rini preserve the POC meaning) but also in the Solomons, as in Roviana tini- 'body', Sa'a ini- 'a person, one (thing)', two languages which also reflect *tinoni. *tinoni may represent the crossing of *tini with a form of *tino or *noni. *noni, as opposed to Minoni, is reflected in Kia (Santa Isabel) noni 'man', and Kwaio noni 'woman', noni- 'body'. Nggela tindalo 'soul, guardian spirit of the home of the dead* and Arosi adaro 'ghost, soul' appear to be analysable Into a base *nda(IR)o 'ghost, soul* and a prefix Nggela ti-, Arosi a- (Arosi shows a number of parallel words referring to a category or person or spirit built from a reflex of POC *qa 'personal article* plus a base), and the Nggela pair tindalo, tinoni, placed alongside *nda(IR)o and *noni, suggest that *ti- may have been added to a base *noni in at some stage. 2.7 CONCLUSIONS. We may revise the reconstructed form-meaning pairings set out tentatively in 1, as follows. The following four words are attributable to POC (or in the case of *kai(n), to a dialect region of POC), with contrasting meanings: *tau, with variant *ta- in some compounds: 'person in any form, including ghosts and supernatural person-like beings*. Maumata or *tamwata, 'human being, esp. in ordinary, living form*. *kai(n), 'person of a place, native, inhabitant' *taumwaqane or *tamwaqane 'male person, man' The fifth form, Minoni, is reconstructible in the meaning 'person, human being' for a dialect area of POC, or a post-POC stage, located in the Solomon Islands. Evidence for several lexicalised compound forms containing *tau- or *ta</page><page sequence="8">99 as the first element was noted. 3. BYPRODUCTS This final section records a few observations which were byproducts of our inquiries into the semantics of *tau, *tamwata, etc. 3.1 SPECIAL PLURAL FORMS FOR CATEGORIES OF PERSON. In Proto-Oceanic distinctions of number in noun phrases were, generally, marked by separate determiners rather than by any change in the form of the noun itself. Nouns denoting categories of person seem to have been an exception; in at least some cases a morphological distinction between singular and plural forms can be reconstructed. In 2.3 we encountered evidence for a contrast in PPN between *kai 'inhabitant' and *kakai 'inhabitants'. While it cannot be shown, in this particular case, that POC made the same distinction, there is reason to believe that it exemplifies an old pattern in the Austronesian family. In llokano, of the northern Philippines, for example, partial reduplication (normally of the initial CVC-) regularly marks plural number: llocano tao 'person' ubing 'child' babae 'woman' tattao 'people* ububbing 'children' babbae 'women' balay 'house' kayo 'tree' batbalay 'houses' kaykayo 'trees' An older pattern of CV- reduplication, no longer productive, survives in llokano in some terms for categories or person, e.g. ?u-?uliteg 'uncles', ?i-?ikit 'aunts'. Relics of such a pattern are found in many languages of the Philippines (L. Reid, p.c.). in the Oceanic subgroup a few languages exhibit productive reduplication of nouns. Lakalai of New Britain is one such, as e.g. bolo 'pig', bolobolo 'pigs', uaga 'canoe', uagaga 'canoes', tavile 'woman', tavivile 'women', hitu 'ghost', hituhitu 'ghosts'. Reconstruction of the original Oceanic or PAN usages is not a simple matter, however. For one thing, reduplication is a fairly natural, iconic means of indicating plurality - it occurs in this function in various unrelated language families - and so could have arisen independently in different branches of the Austronesian stock. In witnesses which show productive reduplication this possibility cannot be ruled out. To establish original usages we need to find agreements of a more specific and arbitrary nature. Although such agreements are scattered throughout the family, they are by no means easy to find. One point on which a number of Oceanic languages agree is in the restriction of special plural noun forms to a small class of terms marking categories of person. Thus, in Molima of Southeast Papua, only a few terms have special plural forms:</page><page sequence="9">100 gwama 'child' vavlne 'woman' gogama 'children' vivine 'women' Similarly in Motu, of the south coast of Papua: mero 'child' memero 'children' hahine 'woman' h?hine 'women' 'oloto 'man* tomotau 'men* tau 'man' tatau 'men' In Kove of New Britain, plural forms are confined mainly if not exclusively to terms for people and living creatures, and are marked by reduplication, e.g. toa 'older sibling', pi. toatoa; tari 'younger sibling', pi. tatari. In the Polynesian languages plural forms of nouns are confined to a subset of terms for persons. In some cases the plural is signified by partial reduplication, e.g. Samoan tam?loa 'man', pi. tam?loloa; Niuean matua 'parent' pi. mamatua What is characteristic of the Polynesian group, however, is the use of vowel lengthening or doubling of the initial vowel to mark plural number in a small number of widespread words. PPN Tongan Samoan Maori Rennellese *matuqa 'parent, motu'a matua matua matu'a old person' *maatuqa 'parents, matu'a m?tua maatua maatu'a old people' *fafine 'woman' fefine fafine wahine hahine Maafine 'women' fafine f?fine waahine haahine Mamaqiti 'child' tamasi'i tamaitiiti tamaiti tama'iti'iti Mamariki 'children' tamaiki tamaiti tamariki tamangiki *tagata 'person' tangata tagata tangata tangata Maagata 'people' tangata tagata taangata taangata PPN short unstressed *a becomes o in Tongan before stressed o or u, and becomes e before stressed i or e. PPN unstressed *aa frequently reduces to short a in Tongan before a stressed vowel. A combination of reduplication and vowel lengthening is occasionally found in Polynesian forms, e.g. Samoan 'olomatua 'old woman*, pi. 'olom?tutua Because of such typological agreements, of a rather specific sort, across diverse AN subgroups, we conclude that POC used partial reduplication as a device, probably the main device, for marking plural number In nouns, and that such morphological marking was probably restricted to a small class of nouns, most or all of which denoted a category of person. To recover the plural forms of specific nouns is more difficult. Perfect agreements in the plural marking of cognate forms across major subgroups are few. There is, however, one striking agreement. In Polynesian languages generally, the word for 'woman' is pluralizad by lengthening (doubling) the first vowel of the base (PPN *fafine 'woman', *faafine 'women*). At the other extreme of the</page><page sequence="10">101 Oceanic language region, in Motu, plural forms for people are usually indicated by reduplicating the first syllable. In two words, however, number contrast is signalled by shifting stress placement. One case is the word for girl: sing, kek?ni, pi. k?keni. The other is 'woman': sing, hahine, pi. h?hine. However natural it may be for languages to use a form of reduplication to denote plurality, the chances of two distantly related languages independently choosing the device of stressing or lengthening the initial vowel, and of choosing just the word for 'woman', and one or two others, among all nouns, are very slight indeed. Thus, one can with some confidence attribute to POC a contrast between *papine 'woman' and *pApine 'women', where *A marks a vowel that is unpredictably lengthened or stressed. There has been no extended discussion of the status of stress or vowel length in POC. In most Oceanic languages stress is not distinctive, and falls on the penultimate syllable of morphemes and on each alternating syllable if the morpheme contains more than three syllables. Vowel length is not distinctive in most of the better-documented languages, but there are a number of exceptions, e.g. Polynesian and Fijian. From this one agreement it may be concluded that stress or vowel length was occasionally distinctive in POC. There are a few other specific agreements. The plural of *tau was probably *tatau, a form that is reflected in a number of witnesses, e.g. Motu, Suau tatau 'men'. The plural of *mweRa 'child, baby' was probably *mwemweRa or *mweRamweRa, e.g. Motu memero 'children'; Kuni memeo 'boys' (vs. melo 'boy'); Mota mwera 'child', pi. reremwera Cf. also Arosi mwera or mweramwera 'very small child'. Beside Motu kekeni 'girl' can be placed such Southeast Solomons cognates as Kwaio geni 'female person; bride whose marriage has not yet been consummated; not pregnant (of cohabiting woman)'; Sa'a keni, Lau geni 'woman'. The POC base can be reconstructed as *gkeni, with initial nasal grade *k, as both Motu and the Cristobal-Malaita languages reflect *k as zero, but *gk as k. Motu kek?ni 'girl' may be an archaism, reflecting an old plural form *gkegkeni, inasmuch as Motu lacks a form *keni, and has developed a new singular form which differs from the plural only in stress placement (see discussion earlier). PPN *kakai 'inhabitants' also has the appearance of being an archaism, in that in PPN reduplication of the first syllable was no longer a favoured or productive means of forming plural nouns. 3.2 A NOTE ON THE ORIGINS OF LONG VOWELS IN POLYNESIAN PLURALS Polynesian languages are unique in the Oceanic subgroup in using vowel lengthening to mark the plural forms of terms for people. In POC it appears that reduplication of the first syllable of the base was the more common procedure. Lawrence Reid has drawn my attention to a parallel in the Philippine language, Inibaloi, which has such contrasts as bii 'woman' pi. bibii; daki 'man', pi. dalaki; anak 'child', pi. aanak; ama 'father', pi. aama; ina 'mother', pi. iina Reid suggests that the Inibaloi forms with double vowels arose by analogic extension of the original reduplication of initial syllables. Formerly vowel doubling occurred only if the root began with a vowel. Later, both CV- reduplication and vowel doubling was used for some roots beginning with a consonant.</page><page sequence="11">102 This explanation will not account for the Polynesian plural forms cited in 3.1. The collection of roots showing special plural forms in PPN and in POC all begin with a consonant. As a precedent for the Polynesian usages we can refer only to the reconstructed contrast between POC *papine and *pApine (3.1). Whether or not this was the only one of its kind in POC remains uncertain. If it was unique, what motivated the generalisation of vowel lengthening to several other plural noun forms in PPN? We cannot answer this question, but it is worth noting that reconstructions of PPN lexicon (Biggs 1979) show vowel length as carrying a heavy functional load, whereas there is at present little evidence that vowel length figured in many phonemic contrasts in POC. FOOTNOTES 1. It is a pleasure to dedicate this paper to Gordon Fairbanks, who as a colleague during my years at the University of Hawaii not only educated me in matters Indo-European but by being hard to convince in argument more than once provoked me into writing more clearly on matters Austronesian. 2. I am grateful to readers of a first draft for comments and additional data. Ann Chowning was particularly generous in sharing her vast knowledge of New Britain and Massim languages. Helpful comments were also contributed by Joel Bradshaw, Robert Blust, Jim Collins, Ward Goodenough, Roger Keesing, Frank Lichtenberk, Peter Lincoln, John Lynch, Lawrence Reid and Andrew Taylor. An award from the National Science Foundation (grant BNS75-19451) assisted me in undertaking this study. 3. These remarks on subgrouping reflect a consensus that has developed over the past decade. While there is disagreement over the details of the interrelationships of Formosan and Philippine languages, there is fairly general acceptance of Robert Blusf s arguments for placing Oceanic in a lower-order subgroup along with South Halmahera - West New Guinea languages which he terms Eastern Malayo-Polynesian.

The dispersal of Oceanic speakers is discussed in a number of papers, including Grace (1964), Pawley and Green (1973), Pawley (1981). 5. Evidence for these reconstructions is given in Pawley (1 982a, b). 6. For example, Rennellese tau-manaha 'chief or owner of a settlement (or ma?ana), tau-kese 'unrelated person, enemy' (kese 'strange'), tau-iku 'old person, important person in a place'. 7. This semantic contrast is? however, sometimes found in Oceanic languages? often with one member of the pair *tau/*tamwata, e.g. Note, for instance. Mota ta-nun 'person' vs. ta-maur 'living person', ta-mate- 'dead person in separation from his body, ghosf, where ta- reflects *tau, -nun is 'real', maur is 'living' and mate reflects POC *mate 'dead'. Proto Remote Oceanic *tau-maquRi 'living person' can be reconstructed, as ancestral also to e.g. Rotuman fa/mori 'human being' (next to f? 'man'), Sesake na-tamoli, Nguna na-tamwoli 'human being'. We conclude from this that in PRO, *tamwata had probably replaced *tau as the ordinary isolable term for 'person', with *tau used only in compound lexemes, and a new expression for 'living person' had been coined. 8. Lawrence Reid (p.c.) points out that the labiovelar *mw in forms such as *tamwata and *tamwaqane may come from an earlier *gm where *g- Is the ligature that can be reconstructed as linking Proto-Malayopolynesian headwords ending in a vowel with following attribute. Thus Reid might reconstruct pre-Oceanic *tau-g-mata and *tau-g-maqane. While it is clear that POC retained a reflex of *g in numeral forms such as *(n)sa-ga-pulu 'unit of ten', *(n)sa-ga-dau 'unit of 100', where the ligature is *-ga-, there is not a great deal of independent evidence for a post-vocalic ligature *-g- in POC. 9. Goodenough (p.c.) says he now regards the likely original meaning of *kainaga as something like 'a kind of people, ethnicity' or 'people of a place', with the meaning 'descent group, clan' as a later development in certain languages. 10. Discussed in Pawley 1981, 1982b, where it is noted that the pair *qa-lapa(s) 'chief and *qa-diki 'first-born son of chief are reconstructible, with PPN *qariki 'chief reflecting the latter. 1 1.
