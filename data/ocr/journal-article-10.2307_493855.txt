<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arthur O. Lovejoy and the Quest for Intelligibility, by Daniel J. Wilson. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980. 248 pages. $18.00, cloth. Arthur O. Lovejoy was, so to speak, an academician's academician. Without wife and family, siblings, or even many close friends, he led a relatively un- eventful private life, gaining fulfillment largely from long years of writing and teaching (mainly at Johns Hopkins). Moreover, when he became involved in extra-academic matters, as he frequently did, he often chose involvements which related closely to the life of the mind and the university. Lovejoy presented, in sum, an ideal figure for an intellectual rather than highly person- alized biography, and that is indeed what Daniel J. Wilson has given us. Lovejoy may have embraced his role as the quiet, dispassionate scholar as a result of childhood traumas (a word I use hesitatingly since Professor Wilson disclaims any intention of writing a psychobiography). His German- born mother died when he was less than two years old; his minister-father soon thereafter suffered a mental and physical breakdown which occasioned a separation from his son for several years. Small wonder that Lovejoy would embark upon a lifelong "quest for intelligibility" in a world which, at so early an age, may have seemed overwhelmingly hostile and alienating, disruptive and chaotic. In pursuing that quest, as both a philosopher and an historian of ideas, he was to achieve a marked degree of esteem and professional recognition. Sheltering such luminaries as William James, Josiah Royce, and George Santayana, Harvard's Department of Philosophy was enjoying its golden age when Lovejoy was in attendance during the 1890s. Influenced in one way or another by all these figures, Lovejoy still failed to come upon that intelligi- bility which would provided a needed theology for the cosmos and, at the same time, replace his father's anthropomorphic theology, which he found uncon- vincing. The young philosopher, repelled by neorealism yet unable to accept</page><page sequence="2">460 The History Teacher the full dimensions of idealism, gradually moved toward an epistemological and psychophysical dualism outlined in The Revolt Against Dualism and a spate of learned articles. However, it was perhaps in his most celebrated work, The Great Chain of Being, that he found philosophical intelligibility by negating a monastic idealism and accepting the existence of a pluralistic and temporalistic world, but one which necessarily was mediated by human reason. Though more a "pure" rather than social philosopher, Lovejoy was also an activist: a settlement house teacher, a founder and first secretary of the American Association of University Professors, a member of the Maryland Civil Liberties Union. His mottled record on civil liberties, I suspect, may provide for most historians the most engaging episodes of this book. During World War I, for example, Lovejoy discarded his customary dispassion in favor of a shrill anti-Germanism which would have pleased a Theodore Roosevelt. World War II found him fully as anti-German, but considerably more infor- mative than propagandistic in his polemics. Finally, the witch hunt of the McCarthy era saw this distinguished scholar condone the fight against the presence of communists on university faculties on grounds that such teachers themselves did not respect civil liberties. Taken as a whole, Wilson's book is a solid work, carefully researched from an impressive variety of sources and lucidly written. There are weaknesses, of course. One certainly might wish to learn more of Lovejoy vis-a-vis his con- temporary peers in both American and European philosophy. What did he think of the logical positivists, as well as religious and secular existentialists, for example? Lovejoy and his work seem simply not to have been placed in as rich a context as possible and desirable. Then, too, readers might legitimately wish to know somewhat more of Lovejoy the person, as opposed to Lovejoy the scholar and public figure. Nevertheless, the strengths do outweigh the weaknesses in this fine study, which should be most useful to philosophers and historians and to their graduate students.
