Jankowsky / Tufts University Y? han?na rani wild ifrlgiya, wall?h berik Wall?h yarham jdd?y wall?h fl m? khall?lt... Oh mother, I am a son of Africa, thank God God bless my ancestors for what they have left me ... ("Song for Busa'diyya," as performed by Abdul-Majid Barnawijune 2001). It may be space more than time that hides consequences from us, the "making of geography" more than the "making of history" that provides the most revealing tactical and theoretical world (Soja 1989:1). This article examines the trans-Saharan movements of stambeli, the spirit possession music associated with slaves, their descendants, and other displaced sub-Saharans in Tunisia. The main purpose of the music is to heal humans by invoking the aid of a wide variety of individualized, named sub sanaran Spirits and North African Muslim Saints who make their presence known through ritualized trance and possession.1 My account of stambeli is shaped by two related claims: first, stambeli was never only of, and only for, the sub-Saharan community; rather, there has always been a strong demand for this ritual music among Arab Tunisians. Secondly, although it is, in part, the otherness of stambeli that has made it so desired by Tunisians, the structure of the music ritually negotiates that difference by charting geo-cultural con nections between sub-Saharan spirit possession practices and North African Islam. Stambeli is a product of, and a commentary on, the historical encounter between sub-Saharan and North ?fricas. Its spirit pantheon is broadly divided into two groups referencing these geographical localities: the Whites (North African) and the Blacks (sub-Saharan). These, however, are not bounded, dis ? 2006 by the Society for Ethnomusicology 373</page><page sequence="2">3 74 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 crete categories. Rather, I argue that much of the cultural "work" of stambeli is concerned with making connections between these two ?fricas rather than setting them apart. This paper is based on fieldwork carried out at Dar Barnu (lit., the"Bornu House"), the last surviving vestige of a network of twenty-one communal houses (diy?r jam?'a; sing, dar jam?'?) established in Tunis during the height of the trans-Saharan slave trade (ca. 1700-1850 CE.). There I became an apprentice toAbdul-Majid Barnawi, the eighty-year-oldyinna, or master of the gumbr? (three-stringed plucked lute). Abdul-Majid is a\sogaladlma kblr, or head, of the house. This title, which combines the Hausa term galad?ma ("head" or "chief ") with the Arabic kblr ("great" or "big"), immediately evokes the encounter between sub-Saharan and North ?fricas and their fusion into something unique in Tunisia. Throughout my apprenticeship, which began as a yearlong endeavor in 2001 and has continued through several subsequent visits to Tunis, I was struck by the way in which stambeli practitioners com bined sub-Saharan, local Tunisian, and pan-Islamic referents in their daily lives. As an apprentice, I trained for hours each day on the gumbr?, accompanied the stambeli troupe to stambeli rituals, and contributed (albeit unwittingly, as I was merely practicing in another room) to the final diagnosis of a patient whose reaction to my gumbr? playing confirmed that she was possessed by a particular type of spirit. Learning the repertoire was the central component of my training. Many of my initial questions about the spirit world would be met with the somewhat cryptic response that all of my answers were to be found "in the music." As I learned more and more of the repertoire, and became capable of identifying the different songs in rituals that I attended and eventually performed in, I realized that the spirit world of stambeli was, as promised, progressively revealing itself to me, and that, indeed, it was only "in the music" that the members of the stambeli spirit pantheon, their rich history of trans-Saharan movements, and their continual relevance in modern Tunisia became manifest publicly. Ritual, as Bruce Kapferer (1991) suggests, is a cultural hermeneutic; that is, it is a performance whereby culture analyzes itself. In what follows, I apply this reasoning to the world of stambeli in or der to convey how that world is musically structured, and how the musical structuring reflects and shapes the cultural encounters of the stambeli com munity. My perspective is from the inside of Dar Barnu, where I, like countless needy others throughout the centuries, was welcomed into the household. Although the majority of household members and ritual specialists are of sub-Saharan descent, such a background is not required in order to enter onto the path of becoming a stambeli musician. In fact, household members often bemoaned how some black Tunisians allegedly use their dark skin color as cultural capital and play stambeli without the proper ritual knowledge.2</page><page sequence="3">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 3 75 What is important to the stambeli elders is that one enters onto the path (thniyya) of the stambeli apprentice. This path is one that continually brings sub-Saharan knowledge and the cumulative history of sub-Saharan displace ment into Tunisia. Histories My experience at Dar Barnu also entailed a great deal of downtime, consisting of chatting, radio listening, and television watching, all supple mented by copious amounts of sweet mint tea. Our conversations often turned to the history of Dar Barnu and the activities of the sub-Saharans in their new home.3 The history of Dar Barnu, as it was conveyed to me over the past several years, provides a compelling history of culture, society, and the state in Tunisia through the lens of cultural memory of a minority. It is a history inseparable from the geo-cultural imagination, both from within and without. The network of communal houses offered support for new migrants and freed slaves by providing an environment in which they could find others who shared their language, customs, and beliefs. Each house corresponded to a political, ethnic, or linguistic sodality in sub-Sahara. Dar Barnu, as its name suggests, congregated people from Bornu, once part of the ancient Kanem Bornu Empire and today referring to the region that encompasses most of northeastern Nigeria and the portions of Niger, Chad, and Cameroon border ing Lake Chad. According to Abdul-Majid, the network of houses in Tunis also included Dar Askar, Dar Badiy, Dar Baghirmi, Dar Bakaba, Dar Barnufi, Dar Darfur, Dar Debarin, Dar Gambara, Dar Ghadamsiyya, Dar Guway, Dar Kano, Dar MaiTakim, Dar Nefis, Dar Shwashna, Dar Songhay, DarTorbega, DarTubu, Dar Waday, Dar Zgayyat, and Dar Ziriya. Through this network, the diversity of sub-Saharan geographies and cultures was preserved and mapped onto the urban landscape of Tunis. While each house had its customs, its own special Saints and Spirits, and a particular way of performing spirit possession ritu als, it seems that the high degree of interaction among the houses led to a gradual consolidation of many related ritual musical traditions into a single practice, based largely, though not entirely, on the Hausa bori.4 This network flourished through the rule of the Husaynid Ottomans (1705-1881), which supported the public performance of stambeli by hosting performances at the court during holidays (the significance of this support is elaborated below). This relationship continued throughout the period of the French protectorate (1882-1956), as the French kept intact, at least symbolically, the ruling apparatus of the Ottoman court. The network, how ever, suffered greatly at the hands of nationalists immediately following Tuni sian independence in 1956. Under Tunisia's first president, Habib Bourguiba,</page><page sequence="4">3 76 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 who was zealously wedded to the ideologies of modernist development and secularism, Tunisian blacks were targeted for their supposedly primitive, pre-modern beliefs and practices.5 Had stambeli remained sealed off inside the network of communal houses, its many critics might not have had the chance to witness the music, and, if they did, their criticisms most likely would not have been so scathing. But stambeli did not remain sealed off from the wider Tunisian society. From at least the early 1700s, stambeli had been performed at shrines for local saints venerated by both sub-Saharans and Arab Tunisians. Under Bourguiba, public performances of stambeli were all but banned, save a brief tryst in the late 1960s. At that time, public interest in stambeli took the form of gauging its potential to modernize and turn another "slave" music into something "great" like American jazz (see Lapassade and Ventura 1966). While some stambeli musicians took advantage of this opportunity (one even penned a "stambeli for Bourguiba"), others were more reticent. Abdul-Majid,for instance, was invited by Tunisian national television to record a program for broadcast. He was surprised, however, to find that the stage was painted "like a jungle" and that the organizers were insisting that he wear a sub-Saharan costume. He vehemently opposed performing in such a setting, and refused to wear the "African" outfit. "I'm Tunisian," he later told me."My mother was Tunisian. I was born in Tunisia. Why should I wear'Afri can' clothes? I don't wear those clothes. This [pointing to his gumbr?], this is [sub-Saharan] African. But / am Tunisian." An informal ban on the television and radio remained in place through the 1990s, after Ben Ali took over the presidency with a bloodless coup d'?tat. While still devoted to an authoritarian method of rule, this current presidency has also opened up to certain opportunities offered by economic globalization, and thus has begun to recognize some of the advantages of acknowledging stambeli's continued presence and allowing its performance in public. This has situated contemporary stambeli ambiguously within non practicingTunisian society, which, influenced by the ethos of the world music market, sees in stambeli an exotic but internal Other.6 Sub-Saharan Identities in Tunisia The socio-cultural politics of identity in Tunisia, as with the rest of the Maghreb, are generally framed in religious (e.g., Muslim vs. Jewish) and/or ethno-linguistic (e.g., Arabic vs. Berber) terms. While these identities are by no means static (indeed, they are often situational and/or overlapping), the sub-Saharan presence in Tunisia complicates such divisions in particular ways. Whereas Berbers and Jews have been considered indigenous Others to politically dominant Arabic-speaking Muslims, sub-Saharans have been</page><page sequence="5">fankowsky:Black Spirits, White Saints 377 understood to be geographical outsiders. However, they could not always already be categorized as non-Muslim and non-Arabic speaking, as most slaves were converted to Islam before their arrival in North Africa, and would learn to speak Arabic once there.7 In Tunisian society, blackness is associated with a sub-Saharan primitiveness that, in turn, has both positive and negative connotations. Blacks in Tunisian society, whether or not they are associated with stambeli, continue to experience racism. Conversations with members of the stambeli community and close Arab Tunisian friends confirmed the existence of widespread prejudice limiting the social, marital, and employ ment options of dark-skinnedTunisians. Even today, the government still uses a stamp of a "Negro head" to denote the lowest grade of silver in its grading system of precious metals. The servitude of slavery remains inscribed on the black body in Tunisia, where the most common term for black people is ivasf?n ("servants"), and where it is not uncommon to hear a speaker specify someone's race by designating that person mahr?q (lit.,"burned") or hurr (lit., "free"). Many Tunisians also ascribe to black people a mysterious and powerful ability to manipulate the spirit world and to protect against misfortune.8 Traditionally, black female servants known as d?d? would accompany Arab boys to their circumcision in order to give them courage, and would even be asked to breastfeed Arab Tunisian boys so that they would grow up "strong and courageous" (on contemporary colactation practices in the Maghrib, see Ensel 2002). Black women were almost always present for good luck at weddings and at childbirth. According to the observations of G. Zawadowski, in early-twentieth-century Tunisia, The dark pigmentation of the Blacks also seems to constitute an effective "scare crow" against the jn?n in Maghrebi popular magic. The presence of a Negro in a family meeting is regarded as bringing good luck, and, in the Tunisian Sahel, one invites a Negro to attend marriage ceremonies for the express purpose of "making the evil eye fly away" (iteyyer el-'ln), according to the picturesque Arabic expression. Their power to protect them from the jn?n is considered so strong that it is enough to make an image of a Negro out of cardboard, wood, bronze, or stone, and place it in a conspicuous place on a wall, for example, to obtain the same result (1942:151 ; my translation). In terms of the musico-religious practices of black Tunisians, as a non black with many ties to non-stambeliTunisian society, I became aware, often uncomfortably, of the different ways in which stambeli has been viewed from outside the community. From my conversations with Arab and self-de scribed Arabicized Berber Tunisians, two broad and interrelated ideological positions were mobilized in statements critical of stambeli. In the first, the conservative Islamic perspective, stambeli and other rituals associated with spirit possession and the "cult of saints" are deemed pagan and therefore un</page><page sequence="6">3 78 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 Islamic. This, however, was much less a prevalent attitude than the second, the high modernizing perspective, in which stambeli and other rituals are seen as primitive, superstitious, and incompatible with the drive towards modernist development. There is, however, another side to this coin. The stambeli community, like many other sub-Saharan diasporic communities around the world, has used this perceived otherness to its advantage. While there are undeniable societal and institutional prejudices against black Africans in Tunisia, there also exists a common belief among Arab Tunisians that sub-Saharans are particularly efficacious in healing ailments brought on by the agency of spirits. Stambeli's niche within the wider framework of traditional healing pro vides the main point of contact for Arab Tunisians. When other modes of heal ing fail, potential clients may be referred to stambeli practitioners. If stambeli spirits are believed to be at work, clients will hold a stambeli ceremony at their home, a major household event that usually involves dozens of friends and relatives. Arab Tunisians might also encounter stambeli at the shrine of a local saint, where it will be performed for a semi-private ritual (for example, when the client lives in an apartment bloc and does not wish to make her ailment and its cure known to neighbors) or during the street processions of the three day annual pilgrimage held each summer. A third and least common point of contact with wider Tunisian society is the concert stage, where stambeli is slowly becoming part of the ubiquitous festivalization of cultural perfor mance in Tunisia. At this point it is germane to mention stambeli's relationship to the gn?tva of Morocco. Stambeli has been considered by French and Tunisian writers as the Tunisian equivalent of Morocco's gn?wa, a similar musical tradi tion originally performed by sub-Saharan slaves in Morocco. In both gn?wa and stambeli, sub-Saharan musico-therapeutic practices involving spirit pos session have entered into an Islamic, and then French (post)colonial, context via the trans-Saharan slave trade. The musical instruments used are highly similar, as is the musical structuring of the ceremony, in which even some of the same Saints and Spirits are invoked. These surface similarities, how ever, obscure important, if initially subtle, differences; we cannot assume that because both are "black" and North African that they involve essentially the same meanings for practitioners, clients, audiences, and society. For starters, the fact that the Tunisian press, when it does mention stambeli (itself a rare occurrence), is compelled to define it as the local equivalent of Moroccan gn?wa, is telling. Simply put, stambeli is not a common component of the public sphere in Tunisia. That the connection to sub-Saharan Africa is more palpable and accepted in Morocco than it is in Tunisia is a common sentiment among Tunisians and</page><page sequence="7">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 3 79 has been point of contention for artists, musicians, and writers across North Africa.9 Furthermore, as Deborah Kapchan has recently observed, gn?wa has become a part of the transnational imaginary, signifying for American jazz artists their African roots, while the same jazz musicians enter into the gn?wa spiritual lineage (Kapchan 2002). Kapchan's selected discography includes over twenty recordings (two of which comprise five volumes) of gn?wa performances, collaborations, and influences. The fact that we garner most of our information on gn?wa from liner notes of such recordings is also revealing. With the exception of a single cassette, locally produced and meagerly distributed in Tunis, there are no recordings of Tunisian stambeli on the market. Furthermore, while race and ethnicity are publicly discussed and debated in Morocco, this is not the case in Tunisia, where early nationalist anti-Berber strategies succeeded in virtually eradicating (or "assimilating") Berber culture. Minorities and their musics in Tunisia are rarely studied or even discussed in such terms. One exception is Jewish music, which Lachmann (1940) and Davis (1986) identified as employing popular Tunisian melodic modes and song structures. In stark contrast, the music of stambeli has remained other, and not syncretic. It has remained emphatically "sub-Saharan" (s?d?nt) and "non-Arab" ?ajm?) in both popular attitudes and musical form. Moreover, the trans-Saharan movements of slaves and other displaced sub-Saharans is nar rated in stambeli through musical reference to certain supernatural characters who take the form of Spirits and Saints. The identities of these Spirits and Saints, and the modes through which humans interact with them?namely, trance and possession?are crucial elements of this alternative historiography. Stambeli and the Black Sahara I turn to the song for Busa'diyya whose lyrics comprise the first epigraph of this article. The lyrics are taken from the song as performed by Abdul Majid Barnawi, whose father was a slave captured in the Bornu region of sub-Saharan Africa and sold to the Ottoman court in Tunis, where he rose to the position of ga'yld, the Ottoman court-appointed overseer or spokesman of the slave community. While his father always wanted to return home to Bornu, Abdul-Majid, who was born in Tunis, never expressed any desire to leave Tunisia. The connection to sub-Saharan Africa, however, as for most descendants of slaves or other sub-Saharans in Tunis, remains an important and palpable part of daily life, as this song attests. In this song, which addresses the predicament of being a black African in Tunisia, the term ifrigiya n (ifriqiya in standard Arabic) refers to Africa?more specifically, sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, although Tunisia was once known to the rest of the world as Ifriqiya, today, in Tunisian Arabic, Ifriqiya refers to</page><page sequence="8">380 Etnomusicology, Fall 2006 that which Tunisia emphatically is not: sub-Saharan, or black, Africa. This anxiety of Africanness has a long history in Tunisian society, dating back at the very least to the fourteenth-century Tunisian polymath Ibn Khaldun, who construed the Sahara Desert as a natural barrier between the civilized and the savage.10 Ever since, socio-linguistic strategies that conflate race and place have naturalized the incommensurability of sub-Saharan and North ?fricas. During the time of the trans-Saharan slave trade, sub-Saharan Africa was known in Arabic as both hilad il-'abld ("land of the slaves") and bil?d il-s?d?n ("land of the blacks"). The latter term is still widely used, and is de fined in contradistinction to bil?d ?-bldh?n ("land of the whites"), or North Africa.11 In their emphasis on the Sahara as a barrier, such constructions deny the historical role of the Sahara as a bridge. From about the year 650 to 1900 CE., experts estimate that the number of captured slaves forced to embark on the trans-Saharan journey surpassed nine million?nearly equal to the sum total of the four centuries of the trans-Atlantic slave trade (Austen 1979:66). The trans-Saharan slave caravan, like Paul Gilroy's (1993) trans-Atlantic ship, foregrounds histories of contact and multiple crossings that challenge the absolutist territorial logic ascribed to the nation-state by nationalist cultural policymakers.12 And like Gilroy's Black Atlantic, the routes of the Black Sa hara were zones of exchange, points of contact, and paths of circulation that witnessed a continual flow of people, goods, ideas, beliefs, and practices. Alongside this trade, there also existed a less formalized and continuous entry of sub-Saharans into North Africa in the form of economic migrants, traders, and religious pilgrims. A Guide for the (Dis)Possessed: The Legend of Busa'diyya In addition to drawing attention to the trans-Saharan movements of dis placed sub-Saharans, the song of Busa'diyya is also central to keeping alive the history of the stambeli community's modes of emplacement in Tunis. During one of our many discussions about this history, Abdul-Majid pointed to a photograph of Busa'diyya that he keeps on a shelf next to his gumbr?, and explained: Who was it that would show them [the Africans] the world here [inTunis]? It was Busa'diyya. Now, they say you cannot find him anymore, that he has gone off to Hammam 1-Anf [a town near Tunis]13... [The Africans] were tattooed and painted in order to tell where they were from, and Busa'diyya knew all of their markings ... he knew them all. [When they arrived] he would tell them,"You have people from your country over there [in that communal house], and you have yours over here [in this communal house] ... Each one had their own markings. Their tattoos were their ID cards." (p.c.) Busa'diyya is at once a mythical and historical figure, fraught with com peting interpretations. The legend of Busa'diyya is about a sub-Saharan man</page><page sequence="9">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 381 who hunted to support his wife and daughter, Sa'diyya. (Busa'diyya, literally, means "father of Sa'diyya") One day, while her father was out hunting, Sa'diyya was captured by slave-raiders and brought to Tunis, where she was sold to a local notable. Upon hearing about the abduction, her father left his village in search of Sa'diyya, following the trans-Saharan caravan routes to Tunis. Once he arrived, he would wander the streets, singing of his pain and sorrow, hoping that someone would show him where his daughter had been taken. He used music as a means of getting the public's attention. He is often por trayed, especially in the indigenous literature, as an itinerant, strangely dressed black foreigner who wanders through the streets singing incomprehensible songs and playing the shq?shiq (handheld iron castanets). Almost always, he is portrayed as scaring children. Chadly Ben Abdallah, in his nostalgic account of Busa'diyya, states, "Little girls and boys used to be fascinated by the phantasmagorical character of this bizarre being, which they could not compare to any known creature" (1988:179-80). Early ethnographer A.J.N. Tremearne depicts him as "a bogey [man]," the only Hausa contribution to masquerades put on by Arabs, who plays for the donations of the spectators (1914:71,241). From within the exiled sub-Saharan community, however, Busa'diyya was someone quite different. His itinerant music-making was not exotic, clamorous, or frightening for exiled sub-Saharans. In fact, it was precisely the recognizability of Busa'diyya's music-making that enabled him to find newly freed slaves and newly-arrived sub-Saharan migrants. Through scarification, painted markings, and clothing, geography and ethnicity were inscribed onto the bodies of sub-Saharans, and Busa'diyya was able to read those inscrip tions. Busa'diyya is an interstitial figure, straddling the line between myth and history, north and sub-Saharan ?fricas, and the longing for a homeland and the immediacy of helping others who were similarly displaced. Today, the vestments of Busa'diyya adorn the wall of the performance space at every annual pilgrimage (ziy?rd) to the shrine (zaiviyd) of Sidi Frej, a black Muslim saint from Bornu and the "patron" saint of Dar Barnu. He is unique in that he is the only member of the stambeli pantheon who is neither Spirit nor Saint; he does not heal, possess, or engender trance. However, his continual pres ence serves as a regular reminder of the movements of sub-Saharans across the Sahara Desert. While he performs the experience of migration, his legend emphasizes not origins and points of arrival, but the experience of movement itself. Saints and Spirits In addition to the trade in humans, there has also been a considerable amount of traffic in spirits across the Sahara. The distinctive and conten</page><page sequence="10">Figure 1. Etching of Busa'diyya (courtesy of JPS Editions).</page><page sequence="11">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 383 Figure 2. (r-1): The yinna Abdul-Majid plays gumbri while Hafiz and Belhas san accompany on shq?shiq. tious musico-therapeutic spirit possession practices, such as stambeli, that integrate or interact with Islam, on both sides of the desert, are powerful signifiers of movement and alterity across?and, indeed, are defining features of?this Black Sahara. Spirit pantheon membership often reflects histories of encounter and contact across the Sahara. Sub-Saharan and North African/ Islamic personalities coexist in spirit pantheons among the gn?wa (Chlyeh 1999; Hell 1999) and hamadsha (Crapanzano 1973) in Morocco; dlw?n Sidi Bl?l (Dermenghem 1954) in Algeria; hauka among the Songhay of Niger (Stoller 1989); bori in Nigeria (Besmer 1983) and Niger (Masquelier 2001); and tumbura (Makris 2000) and z?r (Boddy 1990) in the Sudan, to name but a few. Throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of the red fez worn by Muslim/Arab spirits in numerous spirit possession traditions also attests to histories of trans-Saharan movement and contact (Kramer 1993). Many stambeli spirits can also be found in the Hausa bori pantheon, and until re cently it was not uncommon for stambeli practitioners to use the term bori in reference to these spirits.14 The spirits (literally) embody the encounter between sub-Sahara and North Africa. Like humans, the spirits adapt to social and historical change,</page><page sequence="12">384 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 and may be interpreted differently by different groups. Also like humans, their interpersonal relationships may be redefined when transplanted to a foreign social context. Just as displaced sub-Saharans took part in new forms of alliance, dependency, and genealogy upon landing in North Africa, so too were the spirits' relationships transformed from a framework analogous to the Hausa clan system and into kinship terms having currency in North Africa. Stambeli communicates with two categories of the invisible world: the Saints (awliy?\ sing, wait), who are Muslim and "white," and the Spirits (s?l hln, lit. "holy ones"; sing, s?lih), who are either Muslim or Christian, and "black." The most basic formulation of this relationship is that the Spirits are black and can possess human hosts, while the Saints are white and can induce trance in humans, but cannot possess them. The dyadic relationships between black/white, Spirit/Saint, and possession/trance are of fundamental importance in understanding stambeli.15 What the stambeli Saints and Spirits all have in common is that they are named, social beings with human-like characteristics. They are understood and performed as an expression of social relationships; spirits are human-like actors with the same power to disrupt or enrich another's life. Spirit possession is, above all, a performance and acknowledgment of the complex, often unpredictable actions of social beings. Stambeli and Healing Stambeli is defined by its practitioners quite simply as a "cure" (duw?*). It interfaces with local healing practices associated with local Islamic praxis. Clairvoyants (shuiv?ff?t; takk?z?f), while not considered healers, are often consulted in order to determine what type of healer is appropriate consider ing the client's symptoms. Traditional healers in Tunisia include makers of talismans and writers of Qur'anic charms, sorcerers ?azz?md) who exorcise the jn?n spirits, and musicians of the hadra (Sufi trance ceremony) and st ambeli. The source of the symptoms is often found to be supernatural and treatment may involve the placation of a "believing" (Muslim) spirit through religious offerings or the intercession of a Saint, the one-time exorcism of a malevolent spirit (such as the jn?n), or the managing of a long-term rela tionship between named Spirits or Saints and their hosts, as is the case with stambeli. The two basic categories of possession by Spirits in stambeli are mask?n ("inhabited") and madr?b ("struck") (cf. Crapanzano 1973:152-56). Being struck (ma drub) by a Spirit is usually characterized by a loss of certain physical functions. Symptoms may include paralysis, blindness, deafness, and muteness. One can also be "inhabited" (mask?n) by a Spirit, which suggests a more continuous relationship with the Spirit. The afflicted often experiences</page><page sequence="13">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 385 bouts of fainting, convulsions, syncope, tremors, and other uncharacteristic behavior. The distinction between madr?b and mask?n, however, is of neg ligible practical importance. As long as the affliction has been diagnosed as the work of spirits, the same stambeli healing process begins. The first step in this process is to identify the particular spirit at work. This set of stages involves (1) a diagnostic rite; (2) a rite of divination; and (3) a contract be tween patient and stambeli troupe. The latter involves arranging for a private ceremony by fixing a date and time and, most importantly, the payment of the 'arb?n, or advance. These pre-ceremony rituals are followed by two col lective rituals: the sacrificial rite and the rite of celebration or affirmation. While the majority of stambeli clients are female, there is a noticeable (I estimate about 25%) number who are male. Also, while many of the clients could be described as lower-class, there is also a significant minority who are relatively well off (and who are, in my experience, much more secretive about their involvement in stambeli). Stambeli ceremonies involve a mixing of genders that is remarkable in the context of Tunisia, where religious and therapeutic music performance is almost always gender-segregated.16 The stambeli healing process is one of incremental transformations. The progression of a patient from illness to Wellness consists of several steps, each one bringing the patient and medium closer to appeasing the afflicting spirit. The end goal is not exorcism per se, but rather to build a relationship of accommodation between human and spirit. This relationship is performed through music, embodied through sound and dance. It must be emphasized that neither the music nor the musicians are understood to be responsible for healing. Abdul-Majid was always quick to point out that neither he nor his music could heal an affliction; rather, it is the Saints and Spirits who are responsible. He only facilitates the process by identifying the afflicting spirit, guiding the patient through the appropriate ritual offerings, and finally, enticing the spirit through music to descend into the body of the patient in order to dance. Music, however, does more than entice the spirits to descend and take part in healing. It also creates routes and connections among and between the characters of the pantheon. Although they are categorically differenti ated (see Tables 1 and 2), I suggest that stambeli legitimizes the sub-Saharan presence in Tunisia by performing these historical movements and unifying the Saints and Spirits aesthetically through music. In what follows, I move from the historical and symbolic terrain of stam beli just covered in order to elucidate the musical techniques through which it achieves ritual efficacy I also consider in more detail the unseen characters whose musical invocation narrates this alternative historiography of geo-cul tural encounter."Sonorities and Ontologies" lays out the musical-ontological field and the aesthetic foundations of stambeli, while "The Silsila: Situating the</page><page sequence="14">386 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 Table 1.

Sonorities and Ontologies Stambeli's ontology is predicated on its Otherness, its "sub-Saharanness"; in other words, on being 'ajmi. Being 'ajmi, though literally meaning "non-Arab," has taken on a much more specific meaning in Tunisian society. A definition of exclusion, 'ajm? identifies the black Tunisian as arriving from a pre-Islamic and non-North African background, at once geographically and temporally Other. This otherness is perceived not only in the foreignness of stambeli's sounds, instruments, and lyrics, but also more broadly in its ontological claims about the sources, functions, and nature of music itself. In Tunisian society, the instruments used in stambeli mark radical differ ence in appearance, sound, and function. They are considered to be, both from within and without, non-Arab and (thus) non-Tunisian. 17The instruments also attest to the multiple musico-religious authorities that comprise the foundation of stambeli. The gumbr? (three-stringed lute) is believed to be of</page><page sequence="15">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 387 Table 2. Geo-cultural routes of the Blacks.

Many of the spirits are derived from bori spirits.This group is the most powerful in Tunis, and afflicts many individuals at Dar Barnu (Lake Chad, the largest source of water in Bornu, was also known as "Kuri"). The Bahriyya ("Water Spirits") are common to North African Islam and sub Saharan spirit pantheons.They required little or no modification in the Tunisian context, where fishing and seafaring have been important vocations and popular Islam associates water with danger. The B?y?t ("[Ottoman] Royalty") are the most "local", referencing an important historical relationship between the Ottoman court and the stambeli community. They are recognized by the red tarbush (fez) worn by their hosts. In ritual, they are generous, representing the late Ottoman rulers who supported stambeli and outlawed slavery. sub-Saharan origin and efficacious in communicating with the spirit world. The shq?shiq (iron clappers) are connected to the history of Islam, which in turn is connected to sub-Saharan Africans: they are associated with Sidi Bilal, a black African slave chosen by the Prophet to be Islam's first mu'adhdhin (muezzin), or caller-to-prayer. The gumbr? and shq?shiq are the definitive stambeli instruments, and the majority of stambeli ceremonies only employ these two instruments. Each Spirit and each Saint is identified with and summoned by its own specific n?ba (pi. nuw?yib), or tune. N?ba (from the classical Arabic naw bd) literally means "[one's] turn," and to do things b-nuba is to do them in succession. The n?ba is the fundamental unit of the stambeli repertoire. It is a tune whose music, lyrics, and dance movements are identified with a</page><page sequence="16">388 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 specific Spirit or Saint; the n?ba identifies, and is identified by, that deity. It corresponds, then, to what Gilbert Rouget calls a "call-sign" or a "musical motto" (1986:101). A stambeli ritual entails the successive invocation of nu merous Spirits and Saints through music, involving up to several dozen spirits in a single performance. The n?ba is how a spirit's potentiality for presence, and thus its existence, is recognized. This metaphorical relationship is often verbally manifested; if somebody wishes to know which spirit possesses the patient, the individual would commonly ask, "What is her n?ba?" (shnlyya nubit-h??). The Troupe The organization of the stambeli troupe also marks it as Other in the context of ritual Tunisian musics. Unlike the typical Sufi dhikr, music-making in stambeli is reserved for ritual specialists and performed on instruments understood as off-limits to non-specialists. The typical stambeli troupe is hierarchically organized, with the master-apprentice relationship determin ing the basic relationship among members. As a rule, the master is yinna, who plays the gumbr?. To become a yinna, however, requires much more than proficiency on the gumbr?. The yinna is the voice of ritual authority. At Dar Barnu, he diagnoses the afflicted, selects proper medicines, and deter mines the appropriate ritual procedures. He performs the "structuring of the structure" (Kapferer 1986:202) of the ceremony through the selection and ordering of tunes, marking their beginnings and endings, and responding to the sometimes unpredictable behavior of spirits and dancers. In performance, the yinna is flanked on either side by the sun?'a (lit., "workers" or "manufacturers"), also referred to as shq?shiqiyya, who play the shq?shiq (iron castanets) and comprise the vocal chorus. While the yinna presides over the sun?'a, there is also a hierarchy among the latter. The leader of the sun?'a usually sits to the yinna's right, and is often the lead singer. At times the yinna will sing lead, especially if the nuba is not known to the lead singer. The rest of the sun?'a respond to the lead lines with unison responses. Often the sun?'a are responsible for preparing many of the components of the ritual, such as the lighting of appropriate incense (bkh?r). The sun?'a gain their musical and ritual knowledge from the yinna, who nurtures their development over a number of years. The sun?'a are expected to refer to the yinna, who is always elder, as b?b? ("father"), but for those more distant he may be referred to as khalll ("uncle"). The sun?'a, in turn, are usually treated as family. Traditionally, the ritual specialists of the stambeli troupe would also include the 'artfa (lit.,"she who knows"), who is not a musician but special izes in rituals of diagnosis and divination. The 'arifa also becomes possessed</page><page sequence="17">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 389 and entranced as a matter of course in the ceremonies. When she is not dancing, it is her responsibility to look after the other dancers, ensuring that they do not run into the musicians or the audience. After a therapeutic pass ing out of the dancer, the 'arifa will also perform the requisite chiropractic techniques for expelling the spirit from the dancer's body. The last of Dar Barnu's trusted 'arifas died years ago, and nowAbdul-Majid and his wife Baya share the diagnostic duties. The Gumbr? That music is a means to communicate with the sacred and facilitates the metaphysical encounter between human and spirit worlds is at the ontologi cal foundation of stambeli. More specifically, it is the music (m?stq?), defined as the gumbr? melody, that stambeli musicians and clients alike identified as the active agent. The gumbr? is a bass-register plucked lute with three strings (awt?r; sing.: ivatr) attached to the neck (yidd; lit.,"arm"), which measures about forty-four inches in length and extends through the body and out the other side. Its circular body is in fact also a double-headed drum crafted from a tree trunk. Goatskin is used for the drumhead (/?/i/;lit.,"skin"). It is simultaneously a chordophone and a membranophone; the performer plays melodic lines on the strings while also beating rhythms on the drumhead with the strumming hand. The communicatory function of the gumbr? is reflected in the promi nence of the metaphor of the voice in describing its components and playing technique. The lowest-pitched string, which is situated between the other two, is called shayb ("old man"), since it "speaks" in a low voice. The sec ond string, tuned a perfect fourth above the shayb and situated below it, is called sh?b ("youngster"), for it "speaks" at a higher pitch. The third string, an octave above the shayb and situated above it, is called k?l?, which, as I was told, is a term of sub-Saharan origin translated into the Arabic rd?d, or "the one who answers, replies." In terms of playing technique, it is said that the right hand "speaks" by strumming the strings, and the left hand "answers" by stopping the string. The words of the gumbr? emanate from the qamra (lit.,"moon"), a hole carved into the body of the gumbr? which, in addition to holding spare parts and various amulets, also holds the monetary offerings for safe keeping. Lyrics, Languages, Delivery The lyrics are all considered du'?\ or invocations; they welcome the Spirits and Saints, inviting them to make their presence known. This sets them apart from most Tunisian Sufi songs, which tend to be hagiographie and his</page><page sequence="18">390 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 toriographic records of the Saints'lives. The words of the stambeli tunes are, at one level, considered "unimportant," as they can be altered without having any ritual impact. However, delivery and aesthetics of the singing (ghin?*) are primary. The language of the songs is a mixture of Tunisian Arabic and'ajmi, (in the context of language, meaning not only "foreign" and "non-Arabic," but also "incorrect" and "barbarous"), the latter originating in various languages of sub-Sahara, but mostly derived from the Hausa and Kanuri languages. The distinction between Arabic and 'ajmi, however, begins to break down in the rendering of the words. The delivery of the words, whether Arabic or 'ajmi, is, ideally, performed in what is called a Sudani ("sub-Saharan") manner. While this aesthetic is sometimes described by stambeli musicians as "nasal," it is more often referred to as "not clearly enunciated" (m?sh musarrih), a distinc tion made in contrast to the ideal Arabic aesthetic of delivery, which prizes clear diction (see Danielson 1997:138-41). A Sudani manner of delivery is, in the context of Tunisia, an indexical marker of otherness, and renders all the words, whether Arabic or non-Arabic in origin, as being 'ajmi. Shq?shiq Shq?shiq is the onomatopoetic term for heavy, handheld iron clappers. Each clapper consists of two domed, cymbal-like discs joined by an iron trough, which is where they attach, through cord or twine, to the player's hands. Each player holds a pair in each hand. They have an equivalent in Hausaland, where they are referred to as sambani, and are virtually identi cal to the qr?qab played by the gn?wa of Morocco. Subtle differences in performance practice, however, differentiate the shq?shiq from the qr?qab. The Moroccan qr?qab are fastened together at one end, which limits the volume they are capable of producing. In contrast, the Tunisian shq?shiq is performed in a more open manner in which the clappers vibrate more freely. Abdul-Majid not infrequently reminds his players to make sure their shq?shiq are slightly offset so that air does not get trapped between them, which would muffle their sound. The shq?shiq's connection to sub-Saharan sambani is but one of their historical associations that remains salient within the stambeli community. The shq?shiq are also related, through legend, to Bilal, one of the Prophet Muhammad's companions and the one chosen by the prophet to become Islam's first mu'adhdhin. Bilal was of African (most likely Ethiopian) heritage and born into slavery in Mecca. He was an early convert to Islam (it is thought that he was the second, after Abu Bakr, to convert). Conversion to Islam at the time was not widely tolerated, and he was punished for his beliefs. He was subsequently bought by the Prophet's companion Abu Bakr, and accompanied the Prophet in various capacities, including steward, servant, and soldier (Ara</page><page sequence="19">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 391 fat 1960:1215). Communities of displaced sub-Saharans across North Africa claim spiritual descent from Bilal, who not only came to symbolize ideal traits of Islamic piety, but also came to represent a legitimizing connection between Africans and Islam extending all the way back to the origins of Islam itself. As a slave of sub-Saharan origin whose piety and exceptional vocal abilities were recognized by the Prophet, the figure of Bilal provides a strong historical link between the sub-Saharan diaspora and Islamic orthodoxy. By situating the n?ba of Bilal (known as Jerma in stambeli) immediately after that of the Prophet, stambeli performs an historical relationship musically. The lyrics, which welcome Jerma, preserve some phrases from the Jerma language:^, for instance, is a call for someone to come: Way ay way ay jerma, kakabil?li-ah faddiy irham kakabil?li Truly, truly, Jerma, Come, Come, Bilal Welcome him, grandfather, Come, Come, Bilal Musical Example 1 is a transcription of the n?ba of Jerma. It features the typical pentatonic mode of stambeli, call-and-response singing, and is in the Sudani rhythm. The notes at the bottom of the gumbr? staff represent the rhythms played on the skin of the gumbr? with the yinna's strumming hand. After several cycles, the tempo increases and the notes become closer to each other and nearly, or fully, equidistant, resulting in a triple-pulse feel, as seen in Example 2. Each n?ba undergoes an increase in tempo and a heightening of intensity. The heightening of intensity is not merely an increase in tempo. It is also a transformation of the temporal contour of the measured rhythmic units. For the three-pulse Sudani pattern, the jaggedness of the quarter-eighth-eighth pattern evens out into equidistant eighth-notes, which could be represented as a gradual change between the two rhythms shown in Example 3. This example also highlights another important feature of the stambeli rhythmic aesthetic: offset accenting. These accents do not occur simultane ously with the regular accents of the gumbr?; rather, they commonly fall just after. This results in a metric tension between the gumbr? and the shq?shiq that only intensifies as the n?ba increases in tempo. The Silsila: Situating the Spirits in Music By inducing the arrival of the Saints and Spirits, the music of stambeli mediates the encounter between human and spirit worlds. When played skillfully, and in the proper ritual context, the "words" (kl?rn) of the gumbr? "speak" (yitkallem?) directly to the spirits. This music, however, not only</page><page sequence="20">392 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 Example 1.

The n?bas are organized into larger successions (silsil?t, lit.,"chains;" also tb?', lit., "styles" or "characters") of songs arranged hierarchically, per formed sequentially, and representing different classes of Black Spirits and White Saints.19 Silsilas are most often organized around families of spirits and played in sequential order, from the oldest spirit in the family to the youngest. Although each silsila is theoretically discrete and robust, there is a certain amount of room for improvising the ceremony's structure through song. The musicians must perform for their audience, and thus sometimes</page><page sequence="21">fankowsky: Black Spirits; White Saints 393 Example 2. Jerma at a faster tempo, ftUM?CI GjUMMI ?W misun II-tU-tU-ti-ii-f-tU aqp w n m ni m m ni s fhfhfhfh they repeat certain n?bas (if, for example, many people present trance to the same Saint or are afflicted by the same Spirit), skip certain n?bas, or play them in a non-normative order. The malleability of the silsila, and indeed of each n?ba within it, gives the ceremony a heightened sense of spontaneity and unpredictability. It also, however, is inherently a means of performing connections between Spirits and Saints. The silsila connects certain n?bas, both musically and (thus) conceptually. Each is performed and understood sequentially, but this sequence is prone to manipulation by passing over certain n?bas, repeating others, or in some instances, even inverting parts of the sequence. As certain members of the audience are also affiliated with particular Spirits and Saints, a performance of a n?ba is also a performance of social relations. In a private stambeli, the host's nuba(s) will be performed most often. In this way, the host's status is performed musically. This also often leads to increased amounts of monetary offerings to the musicians. If the n?bas provide the content of the stambeli ritual performance, then it is the silsila that provides the larger structural framework. Thus, music does not merely allude to or represent an abstracted pan theon of spirits. Stambeli is a system of knowledge that is performed and Example 3. Rhythmic transformation during tempo increase (s?d?m rhythm) rtr to:</page><page sequence="22">394 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 embodied. It is not, like textual Islam, abstracted, external, texted knowledge. There are no formal recited or written texts to represent the structure of the pantheon, nor are there any social institutions or pedagogical practices dedicated to the process of transmitting such knowledge as an abstract set of information. Rather?and this is a crucial point?the stambeli pantheon only comes into being through its musical performance. Through perfor mance, the music produces, reproduces, and reworks the organization of the stambeli pantheon of Saints and Spirits and the interrelationships among its members. The following sections examine the histories and identities associated with the different unseen characters of stambeli, each of whom is a sort of waystation along the routes through the pantheon taken by the musicians and dancers. White Saints The category of al-abyad ("the Whites") is comprised exclusively of Muslim personalities, most of whom are considered saints. The term "White" is believed to reflect the white jallibiyya, or robe, worn by many pious Mus lims. It also references locality: while the Blacks originated in, and live in, sub-Saharan Africa, the Whites (even those who were of sub-Saharan origin) lived in North Africa, which, as mentioned above, is also known as the "land of the whites"(bil?d il-bid?n). The stambeli ceremony of Dar Barnu invariably opens with three n?bas representing important personalities in the pantheon, and which are "tied together" (mur?bit mablnhum)\sl?t in-nabl (Prophet's Prayer),Jerma (Sidi Bilal), and Bu Hijba. The idea of being "tied together" is an important and highly symbolic concept in stambeli: musically, it means that the n?bas are played in succession without stopping, a performance of the idea that they are tied together not only aesthetically, but conceptually and historically. Positioning sl?t in-nab? first in the silsila is a performance of the Prophet Muhammad's importance in stambeli. Immediately following is the n?ba for Jerma. Jerma (also transcribed as Djerma or Zarma), is a sub-Saharan ethno-linguistic group situated near the Bornu region. In stambeli, Jerma is also the 'ajmi name for Sidi Bilal. Bilal is an important figure in many black North African musico-religious communities. As a slave of sub-Saharan origin whose piety and exceptional vocal abilities were recognized by the Prophet, Bilal provides a strong historical link between the sub-Saharan diaspora and Islamic orthodoxy. Just as importantly, legends of Bilal also attest to his ability to heal and mediate disputes through music and dance (P?ques 1964:479). The third personality in this section of the silsila is Bu Hijba, a shortened appellation of Sidi Salah Bu Hijba Ras al-'Ajmi. Little biographical information has been transmitted about Bu Hijba,20 but the title ras al-'ajml ("head of</page><page sequence="23">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 395 the non-Arab [spirits]") is appended to his name, which directly connects the Saints to the pantheon of Spirits. The Prophet and Jerma are unique among stambeli pantheon members in that they do not appear in ritual through engendering trance or possessing a host; like God above, who is invoked in the opening prayer, they are above engaging in physical interaction with humans. This does not mean, however, that there is no interaction; performing these n?bas is a means of praising them in hopes of attaining some of their blessing. After this opening trium virate, the ceremony typically proceeds to the n?bas for the Mash?yikh. The Mash?yikh The Mash?yikh (sing.,shaykh) form an important category of the Saints. This category is populated solely by the four most active and powerful of the stambeli saints: Sidi Frej, Sidi Sa'ad, Sidi Abdeslam, and Sidi Abdul-Qader. Sidi Frej and Sidi Sa'ad are only venerated locally in the Tunis area, while Sidi Abdeslam and Sidi Abdel-Qader are also recognized far outside of Tunis. The Mash?yikh are not only the most powerful of the Whites, but are also the only Whites to demonstrate certain traits that are characteristic of the Black spirits. They, in my estimation, form a sort of fulcrum between the Whites and the Blacks, blurring both categories. The Mash?yikh not only engender trance, but can also possess a human host, and, when inhabiting a host in a stambeli ceremony, can speak through the host to divine futures of partici pants and audience members. Both Sidi Frej and Sidi Abdeslam have a special relationship to Dar Barnu. Sidi Frej could be considered the "patron" saint of Dar Barnu; Sidi Frej was Barnawi, and, while all stambeli groups would visit the shrine of Sidi Sa'ad each year, the Dar Barnu community would also hold an annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Sidi Frej. The shrine of Sidi Abdeslam is meters from the entrance of Dar Barnu, which is located in Beb Sidi Abdeslam. Sidi Abdeslam usually follows Sidi Frej in performance. If a member trances to Sidi Abdeslam, s/he will perform one of the stock trance movements, and will wear a tri-colored banner (sunjuq). However, when possessing a human, Sidi Abdeslam is well known for making his hosts wear a white kashabiyya cloak and pass lighted stalks of hay over their extremities to demonstrate his protection over their bodies. He will also often have his host call on the musicians to stop the music in order to recite the f?tiha (the opening verse of the Qur'an). Other Stambeli Saints The Saints are, for the most part, considered local?having lived or died in Tunisia or its North African neighbors. They all have shrines in Tunisia,</page><page sequence="24">396 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 and may be venerated far outside their towns or only very locally. What is important is their relationship to the displaced sub-Saharan community: the vast majority of stambeli Saints are of sub-Saharan origin and are venerated in North Africa. The stambeli at Dar Barnu also accords a prominent place to Sidi Marz?g, who lived in Nefta (a desert oasis town in the far southwest ern corner of Tunisia), as well as to Sidi Mans?r, who lived in the coastal city of Sfax, where a group of black sailors would congregate for stambeli. These two saints have similar functions to Sidi Sa'ad and Sidi Frej in their respective locales: the shrines of both Sidi Mans?r and Sidi Marz?g are sites of group pilgrimages each year. Other saints in this part of the silsila include Sidi 'Amer, Sidi 'Amer Bu Khatwa, and Sidi Bu Ras al-'Ajmi. Some others, such as Sidi Bechir and Sidi Hammuda, have disappeared from the ceremonies, as the last of the members whom they entrance have since passed away. Still other saints, while not technically part of the White silsila, have been introduced into this part of the ceremony. Sidi Belhassen and Sayda Manu biyya are not stambeli Saints per se, yet they have stambeli n?bas that are only performed "on demand." This means that, unlike the Saints of the silsila, whose n?bas will be performed whether or not someone present dances, Sidi Belhassen and Sayyida Manubiyya will only be performed if someone present requests the n?ba. Neither Sayyida Manubiyya nor Sidi Beihassan are of sub-Saharan descent nor have the special status of certain non-sub-Saharans such as Abdel-Qader. Both of these saints fall outside the stambeli silsila, and thus outside the stam beli pantheon. What is special about these saints, however, is that they are both local saints active in treating their followers' ailments through trance and possession. The z?wiya of Sayyida Manubiyya may be the most regularly visited shrine in Tunis due to its popular weekly healing ceremonies, geared mostly toward lower-class women with marital or fertility problems. The z?wiya of Sidi Belhassen also hosts women's trance and possession ceremo nies, but of a much different nature. The official followers of this order are men, generally from the petit bourgeoisie, who consider their weekly dhikr ceremony to be the most "orthodox" of activities. What is remarkable is that in an adjoining room, women become entranced and possessed by the music of the men's dhikr. By acknowledging these saints and their followers by performing these n?bas, stambeli triangulates with the practices of the other two most influential trance and possession practices in the greater Tunis area. Black Spirits It is useful to begin with what the Spirits are not. They are not the spirits of the "African ancestors." In fact, they are not of human origin. They are not</page><page sequence="25">fankowsky:Black Spirits, White Saints 397 the anthropomorphic spirits of objects and places venerated by practitio ners of animism in E. B. Tylor's theory of primitive religion. Nor are they the totems of any sub-Saharan "clans," although Tremearne believed this to be historically true in his 1914 study. While many stambeli Spirits are related to those of the Hausa bori pantheon, a relationship made explicit by stambeli participants themselves, they were not simply relocated to Tunisia. Some spirits disappeared, while others emerged. The latter, as well as those that remained, were reinterpreted within a new cosmological framework. While there are certain continuities with the bori ritual system, new functions and meanings associated with the spirits emerged in the Tunisian context. Most importantly, in terms of stambeli's interaction with certain sectors of Tunisian society, the Spirits are also not the jn?n (also jinn) of which the Qur'an speaks, and which are exorcised in rituals across the Muslim world. According to stambeli practitioners, the jn?n work for the devil (Shaytan), and stambeli cannot heal or help in any way those afflicted by the jn?n. This aligns stambeli with Qur'anic Islam, which prohibits the exorcism of the jn?n, which it considers magic. The Spirits, in contrast to the jn?n, "all work for God," and stambeli is a form of veneration of Saints, holy Spirits, and, above all, God. This distances stambeli from exorcism of the jn?n, a practice considered sacrilegious in the context of Islam. As it does with Muslim saints, stambeli acknowledges the existence of categories of spirits that are beyond its ritual reach. The stambeli Spirits are referred to in a variety of terms. At Dar Barnu, the collective terms in use are (1) in-n?s il-ukhr?n, or "the other people"; (2) is-salhln (sing, s?lih), or "the holy ones";21 and (3) l-khtU (sing, l-akhal), or "the blacks." While the terms are often used somewhat interchangeably, their continued coexistence reveals that each one points to a nuance of identity that no single term alone can encompass. The first term, in-n?s il-ukhr?n, is the most general of the three, and indicates that the Spirits are human-like actors. Indeed, they are understood to be like humans in many ways. Each has a distinct personality with certain tendencies, desires, and idiosyncrasies. Their behaviors, like those of humans, can be surprising, even to their hosts. They are gendered, organized into families, and socially differentiated accord ing to class. The second term,is-salhin,is slightly more specific, and defines the Spirits as distinct from both the jn?n and the awliy?' (Saints). With regard to the latter, however, is-salh?n also situates the Spirits on the same level of power and respect as the Saints. To be called a s?lih is to be considered a spiritual power within the socio-religious framework of Tunisian society. The Spirits are thus on equal footing with the Saints. Both the Spirits and the Saints are considered to be blessed and, "like ministers working for the President," ac cording to several musicians, working for God.</page><page sequence="26">398 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 The third term, 1-kh?l, is more specific still. It marks the Spirits as "black," in contradistinction to the "white" Saints. The Spirits, as opposed to the Saints, are unequivocally sub-Saharan and black. Through this terminology, we see that the Spirits are holy, they are black, and they are Other. The stambeli Spirits are organized into three major groups: Ban? Kuri (Kuri's Children), Bahriyya (Water Spirits), and B?y?t (Royalty). While all three are understood as originating in sub-Saharan Africa, each of the groups represents a different set of relations between sub-Saharan and North ?fri cas. Those of Banu Kuri are black, Christian, and, as they have no parallels in Tunisian Islam or Tunisian referents, are the most Other of the groups. The Bahriyya reveal parallels between the sub-Saharan and North African concep tions of spirits: these "water spirits" of sub-Saharan Africa required little or no modification to enter into the cosmological framework of North African Islam, which holds similar assumptions about the presence of potentially malevolent spirits in and around water. Finally, the B?y?t provide a powerful commentary on Tunisian history: the arrival of the B?y?t Spirits corresponds directly to the departure of the Ottoman Beys from Tunis and the subsequent suppression of the practice under nationalist regimes. It is not my aim to present an exhaustive inventory of Spirits, but rather to sketch the main characteristics of the groups and how they are understood geo-culturally. Banu Kuri: Representing Dar Barnu's Origins in Sub-Sahara The Banu Kuri family's membership reveals a direct and powerful link to the Hausa bori traditions in sub-Sahara (and shows an interaction with the Hausas that took place in both sub-Sahara and in North Africa).22 The Banu Kuri spirits are also collectively referred to as Br?wna (plural of Barn?wi), in reference to their Bornu origins.23 The Br?wna spirits are all Christians (maslhiyyln)24 and must be invoked after sunset, ideally after midnight. Black is of high symbolic import: something black (ml?khiyya, an okra dish which is associated with the lower classes) must be eaten, and the dancer must wear a black cloak (kashabiyya). The Spirits can be violent, and several beat their hosts with rods, sticks, or knives. Collectively, they are considered the most powerful of the Spirits at Dar Barnu, and the most likely to afflict individuals affiliated with the house. Indeed, one room at Dar Barnu features a "temple" (gidan) dedicated to Kuri. When an adept of the Banu Kuri group dances, she dances to and is pos sessed by each member of the Banu Kuri succession. The hosts wears a black kashabiyya when s/he dances. The Kuri silsila begins with Dakaki, a Hausa name meaning "the crawler." When he possesses a human host, he dances by squirming in a prone position on the ground, gradually advancing toward the gumbri. Once he reaches the gumbr?, it is Kuri's turn to enter. Kuri is known as a spirit that enjoys drinking wine. In the past, his hosts would often take</page><page sequence="27">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 399 swigs of wine while possessed. At the time of my research, those afflicted by Kuri would instead make wine part of their sacrifice to him by pouring a bottle of red wine at a four-way crossroads as an offering. Kuri begins his dance on his knees, reaching up into the air with each hand, alternately, as if climbing. After this strenuous episode, he will fall back and request his wooden pestle, which he uses to beat the head and stomach of his host. Next comes Migzu, a brother of Kuri, who dances in a similar manner to Kuri but beats his host with a walking-stick rather than a pestle. Following these are Jamarkay (Kuri's brother) and Baba Magojay. The Banu Kuri silsila normally ends with the n?bas for Ommi Yenna and her sisters. Ommi Yenna is Kuri's wife, and her host sits on the ground, covered by a white cloth. Four women each take one corner of the cloth and beat it up and down in time with the music. When the music stops, the host usually emerges from this speaking as Ommi Yenna, divining the futures of those present. When the consultations are completed, the silsila begins again, this time with Ommi Yenna's sisters Babam Zohra and Adama. The remaining spirits of the silsila include Nikiri (Kuri's brother, who hits his host with a club with a hooked end), Sa'id, and Salama. Bafcriyya ("Water Spirits"): Common to North and Sub-Saharan ?fricas The Bahriyya are spirits that reside in or around water. This includes not only seas, rivers, and lakes, but also wells, drains, bathtubs, water closets, and the like. Bahriyya often afflict those in low-paying and menial jobs that involve water, such as fishermen, Turkish bath attendants, and maids. When involved in ritualized possession, a Bahriyya spirit can only be coaxed out of its host by the 'arifa sprinkling water on the neck and head of the host. The Bahriyya are led by Mulay Ibrahim (Lord Ibrahim), who is also known as Dodo Ibrahim, dodo referring, in the Hausa language, to evil spirits in general, but also to "a chief, a European, or anything feared" (Bargery 1934:262). He dances in a swimming motion. The Bahriyya also include Mulay Ibrahim's mother May Saderwa, Jawayay, Bahriyya, Sidi 'Ali Diwan, Bakaba, and Sarkin Gari. Water spirits, whether associated with rainfall, streams, rivers, lakes, or the sea, are ubiquitous in spirit pantheons across West, Central, and East Af rica. In North Africa, fishermen and other seafarers often make sacrifices to water spirits or Muslim saints with special connections to water such as Sidi Mans?r or Sidi Daoud.25Throughout the Islamic world it is commonplace to utter bismill?h ("in the name of God") upon entering a bathroom in order to prevent water spirits in sinks and drains from being offended, and sailors will also utter this mantra to prevent any capricious activity by the spirits of the sea. Carelessness with water (e.g., disposing of hot water by pouring it</page><page sequence="28">400 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 on the ground without uttering bismillah) is one of the most common ways of inviting affliction by spirits. B?y?t ("Royalty"): From Bori to Stambeli The category of B?y?t ("the Beys," or rulers of Ottoman Tunisia), given its historical associations, is unique to North Africa, and perhaps even Tunisia. Unlike the members of Kuri or the Bahriyya, several of the Hausa Muslim spir its outlined byTremearne have been reinterpreted and reclassified into this category, which is an important one at Dar Barnu. At the time ofTremearne's study in 1914, May Nasra was one of the "Little Spots," so classified due to his penchant for causing smallpox, sore eyes, and rashes. He was also character ized by holding a large spear. Today, May Nasra wears a tarbush, carries a l?ha (schoolchild's chalkboard), and complains of problems in school. Such a change in identity suggests that stambeli is a dynamic practice that adapts to changing social circumstances and individual needs.26 The B?y?t include Yerima (also known as Sidi Rima) and Guindema, as well as Miriamu and Aisha, two of Ommi Yenna's daughters. These two are always the final two n?bas performed in Dar Barnu ceremonies. Just before the n?ba of Miriamu, a large, decorated bowl of sweets is brought in front of the gumbr? and covered with a cloth. Miriamu and 'Aisha arrive in order to bless the sweets, which are distributed to all attendees by members of the group, who throw the sweets into the audience. While the distribution of sweets is a moment that everyone looks forward to, and ends the ceremony with a sense of celebration, this closing episode has much deeper symbolic import: by presiding over the sweets (considered "theirs") and distributing them to all, Miriamu and'Aisha recreate the generosity of the Beys, who would reward the stambeli community each holiday with food, gifts, and money. According toAbdul-Majid, what set the B?y?t apart from subsequent regimes was that "they understood that Tunisia is part of Africa." The oral history maintained at Dar Barnu refers to this era, the waqt l- B?y?t ("the time of the Beys"), as the golden age of stambeli. The Beys supported stambeli. Tremearne (1914:23) notes that one of the cousins of the Bey had his own private bori temple. It is reported that the ruler Sadiq Bey gave to Sidi Sa'ad the house that would eventually become the z?wiya of Sidi Sa'ad. The landlord of the z?wiya was the Bash Agha eunuch, holder of the highest court position for slaves and adviser to the Bey. He was buried next to Sidi Sa'ad in the early 1800s (P?ques 1964:628), further evidencing the connection between stambeli, slavery, and the Ottoman court. According to the oral history at Dar Barnu, during holidays, stambeli musicians would gather together and go to the Ottoman court in Tunis to perform for the Bey, who would reward them with gifts. These performances brought together</page><page sequence="29">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 401 musicians from most, if not all, of the communal houses, who presented themselves as a single unit. Such non-ritual performances were significant in symbolically reaffirming the court's recognition of the black community. Music, therefore, enabled the community to mark space for itself in the Tunisian state. It is clear from my experience inside the Dar Barnu community that this historical narrative is a strategy for implicitly criticizing subsequent Tunisian social changes and political regimes. Stambeli's counter-histories employ a particular reading of the past in order to come to terms with a discomfiting present. The Beys were everything that subsequent ruling regimes were not: supportive of the black community not only culturally, but also socially, politically, and economi cally. Ritual Performance of Musical Routes Thinking only in terms of these categories, however, does not do justice to the cultural "work" of stambeli. Despite the categorical differences between the Saints and the Spirits, they are unified aesthetically, and thus conceptually, through music. No rhythmic, melodic, or lyrical devices are used to differenti ate the Saints from the Spirits. The members of the Whites all have histories that somehow connect to sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharans did not just "confuse" Saints with Spirits; they are categorically distinct yet not incompatible. To illustrate this point, I present three ethnographic moments that I have described in more de tail elsewhere (Jankowsky 2004). For our present purposes, these examples simply illustrate the different musical routes through the pantheon taken by the musicians. The examples progress from a small and private ritual at Dar Barnu to a larger, but still private ritual at a private home, and finally to a large, semi-public annual pilgrimage, thus providing an overview that covers the different contexts of stambeli performance. At Dar Barnu Kuri afflicts Abdul-Majid's daughter Emna, who must perform two stam beli rituals per year to appease the spirit. The stambeli for Emna?a young, educated Tunisian in her early twenties who had finished first in her high school class and was "chased" out of the university by the khumaynistes (radical Muslim students)?was remarkably private, taking place among fewer than twenty family members and friends in the courtyard of her home at Dar Barnu. During this relatively short ceremony, Emna became possessed by members of the Banu Kuri family, the Mash?yikh, and the B?y?t family (see Table 3).</page><page sequence="30">402 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 Table 3. Musical routes through the pantheon during the stambeli at Dar Barnu. Saints Slat in-Nabi Jerma Sidi Bu Ras al-Ajmi SidiAbdul-Qader Sidi Frej SidiAbdul-Qader At a Private Home At a private healing ritual near Tunis I attended in 2001, the patient was af?licted by Sarkin Gari of the Bahriyya. She required a more elaborate ritual, consisting of a pre-sunset rite of sacrifice and a post-sunset rite of celebra tion. As the main goal of the rite of sacrifice is to placate Sarkin Gari, his n?ba occupies a prominent place in the route followed by the musicians. It is the only n?ba that is repeated in this ritual episode; it is performed first, fourth, and last. His spirit family, the Bahriyya, is the only spirit family invoked in this section, and the Mash?yikh, the most powerful of the stambeli Saints, are the only Saints invoked. In addition, the n?ba of the legendary character Busa'diyya, the only n?ba that represents a stambeli personality who is neither Spirit nor Saint, is played. The musical routes through the pantheon during this rite of sacrifice were as follows (see Table 4): Table 4. Musical routes through the pantheon during the sacrifice.

This sacred journey to a sacred space makes the stambeli pilgrimage immediately comprehensible in terms of common practices as sociated with the veneration of saints in Tunisia. To the outside observer, however, this pilgrimage is immediately identifiable as Other by its unusual rhythms, foreign instrumentation, obscure lyrics, and predominance of black musicians and ritual specialists. This inseparability of sameness and difference is, as I have been suggest ing throughout this article, at the heart of stambeli. Here I must mention the equally simplistic and distorting scholarly claims that "black" and "white" are incompatible categories (Rahal 2000) and that stambeli practitioners merely "confused" local Muslim saints for Spirits (P?ques 1964). It is clear from my experience as a member of Dar Barnu that the Saints and the Spirits are in separable in performance. Performance of the one makes no cultural sense without the implicit knowledge of the potential presence of the other. The musico-spiritual trajectory of the pilgrimage is one in which the presence of the spirits gradually intensifies over the three days. While there is a"frontloading"of whites during the first day (which is only sensible, as the pilgrimage is in honor of one of the whites, Sidi Frej), by the third evening, the blacks are in full force. At no time, however, are they mutually exclusive (see Table 5): Table 5. Musical routes through the pantheon during the third evening stambeli of the annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Sidi Frej, summer 2005.

He interprets cults borne of contact, such as those practiced by displaced African slaves, as anticipating this era of internationalization in which we live. In other words, rather than seeing practices such as stambeli as premodern or non-modern, we could position them as "beyond modernity," as predating the modern, remaining relevant throughout it and beyond, and anticipating this era of the global. Stambeli has survived and adapted itself to new contexts over hundreds of years. It has survived outright banning of the practice and frail attempts at co-optation into the folklore machinery of the state. It has not been replaced by "orthodox" religious practices, nor have "modern" forms of healing replaced it. It has, and continues, to coexist with these phenomena. Stambeli was present before the modern moment, and the fruits of modernity (or at least the modernizing project) have not, perhaps cannot, address the social, cultural, and religious issues to which stambeli speaks. Stambeli is born of, and predicated on, the historical movement of bodies across the Sahara. While the discourse surrounding stambeli is fraught with dichotomies (self/other, Tunisian/African, black/white, here/there, depar ture/arrival, modern/archaic), I argue that the sonic, ritual, and social spaces of stambeli provide a way of negotiating those dichotomies. In other words, stambeli itself is a "way to move." The diasporic sub-Saharan community ofTbnis built a network of support that was both unique and creative. Consider, for instance, Abdul-Majid's title of galad?ma kb?r, a term that combines a Hausa noun with an Arabic adjective in order to denote a position without equivalent in either Hausaland or in Tunisia. It, like the network within which it functioned, was informed by ele ments sub-Saharan and Tunisian, but corresponded fully to neither. Stambeli is a style of being-in-the-world, in which hybridity, in Homi Bhabha's terms, is not about being "able to trace two original moments from which the third emerges," but is instead "the 'third space' which enables other positions to emerge" (1990:211). While its name refers to a specific sub-Saharan empire, Dar Barnu is more usefully seen as a node in a network, a landing point for a diversity of dislocated persons. The house is itself a way to move; its courtyard, a space for performing the rituals of stambeli, allowing sub-Saharan music, migrants, and spirits to arrive and claim space by taking an active role in (re)defining the terms of their encounter with their Others. Dar Barnu (and the black Sahara) could thus be considered what Michel Foucault calls a "heterotopia," a space "capable of juxtaposing in a single real place several spaces, several sites that are in themselves incompatible"</page><page sequence="33">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 405 (1986:25). I find the concept of "heterotopia" useful in imagining space as performed in, and by, human geographies, for it provides us with a point of entry into a mode of analysis that is comfortable with the uncertainties of movements, crossings, and the imagination. It allows us to accept the messi ness of lived-in places defined not so much by history as by geography?the juxtaposition of Foucault's incompatible sites. This is not to suggest that Dar Barnu, Tunis, or the Black Sahara are unique in being heterotopic; quite the contrary. Heterotopias are defining features of Foucalt's modern world. It is how these spaces are imagined, how they juxtapose those "incompatible" sites, and why those sites are considered incompatible in the first place, that is of interest. Stambeli recreates its own movement?the movement of the sub-Sa harans?across the Sahara and its ensuing historical encounters in North Africa. Significantly, the history of slavery is not emphasized in stambeli (in contrast to the gn?wa of Morocco, see Fuson 2003). Instead, connections that legitimize the sub-Saharan presence are emphasized. What my reading suggests is that stambeli is not just about spiritual encounter, but is more so about geo-cultural encounter. The Saints and the Spirits perform a sacred history of geo-cultural movement between sub-Saharan and North ?fricas. It is through music that these performances are recreated, reworked, and remembered. Stambeli is an autonomous sphere of cultural creation that draws on, but is not reducible to, any of its sub-Saharan, Islamic, Tunisian, or Ottoman referents. This suggests that from within, stambeli is not about difference per se, but about connections; that is, it is about routes more than it is about roots. To return to the legend of Busa'diyya: from without, he is remembered as a mythical character, a wandering, clamorous clown known for frightening children. His presence is frightening but fleeting?his movement constant, demonstrating that he does not belong. He is, in other words, utterly place less. But from within, Busa'diyya is a real historical figure, one who provided guidance for the displaced and dispossessed. He led exiles into a community that served to help others in similar situations. Today the masked costume of Busa'diyya is an important element in the annual ziy?ra. Hung conspicu ously on the wall, it is more than d?cor marking the African roots of stambeli; it represents the movements and placelessness of the sub-Saharan body. As a symbol of the connections between North and sub-Saharan ?fricas, Busa'diyya is emblematic of the Black Sahara. As a figure misunderstood and misrepresented from the outside, yet performing hidden meanings from the inside, he is emblematic of stambeli. Through the continued performance of stambeli and the oral history of Dar Barnu, Busa'diyya's agency is reclaimed. But today, Busa'diyya is gone, perhaps "off to Hammam 1-Anf." This town, on the Mediterranean coast south of Tunis, is sufficiently far enough away to</page><page sequence="34">406 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 explain his long absence, but it is also close enough to suggest he may one day return. It also suggests that he rightfully belongs in Tunisia. Acknowledgments This paper is based on fieldwork funded by Fulbright/IIE and the American Institute for Maghrib Studies. An earlier version was first presented at the Society for Ethnomusicology 2003 Annual Conference in Miami, FL. I would like to thank Martin Stokes, Owen Wright, and the Journal's three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments and suggestions. Notes 1 .Throughout this article, the stambeli categories of Spirits and Saints are flagged by capital letters, while their more general counterparts?other spirits and saints that are not explicitly part of the stambeli system?remain in lowercase. 2.The issue of skin color was discussed often when I first arrived at Dar Barnu. The stambeli troupe had just returned to Tunis after a performance in France. However, they arrived without three of the musicians, who took this international opportunity to immigrate illegally to Europe. These were not Abdul-Majid's first choice of accompanying musicians. However, when the festi val organizers saw the best musicians perform, they told Abdul-Majid that they were "not black enough" for a performance of music they were advertising as n?gro-africaine, afro-tunisien, and performed exclusively by descendants of black slaves (Esber 2001). Abdul-Majid's protests about replacing seasoned and reliable performers with younger, undisciplined musicians who just happened to have darker skin were ignored. Abdul-Majid, seeing this as financially benefi cial, and as a rare opportunity for his family to see France, decided to perform and bought the musicians their passports, visas, and even new clothing for the performance. Before the concert series ended, three of the musicians had disappeared. Two of the musicians were eventually caught by police in France and Italy, and the third returned of his own volition. 3. All conversations were in Tunisian dialectical Arabic. I would later learn that my lack of proficiency in spoken French had been interpreted as evidence of my good intentions, as Abdul Majid had endured less than positive experiences with French researchers and journalists, as well as positive ones with American musicians such as Charlie Byrd in the late 1960s. 4.The musical and linguistic impact of these interactions is also suggested byTremearne (1914:250), who records an instance of Kanuri words entering a mostly Hausa song due to the singing of an 'arlfa (priestess) from Bornu. 5. Most prominent among stambeli's critics was influential Tunisian scholar Sadiq Rizgui, who accuses stambeli practitioners of using Muslim shrines as a smokescreen for their "pagan" practices that reveal "a clear return to their savage state (tawahhushy (1968:156). Rizgui also voiced his fears over stambeli's corrosive and contagious effect on Tunisian society. Muslims and even Jews in Tunisia, he claimed, were being duped into believing in this false magic practiced by outsiders to Islam. 6. See, for instance, the newspaper articles that began to appear just prior to the "Stambali: Transe-mission" concert at the Center for Mediterranean and Arab Musics. These articles all had to explain and define stambeli, and often did so by comparing it to Moroccan gn?wa, which was presumably more well-known to the readership (Alya 2001; Ben Ammar 1997, 1998; Zouaoui 1998). 7. Further complicating race relations is the fact that sub-Saharans often comprised entire military regiments and served as guards for the French during their colonial endeavors in the Maghreb. 8.Tremearne notes that this was also a prevalent belief in Europe, where the word "nec romancy" was corrupted into"negromancy,"or black magic (1914:453 nl).</page><page sequence="35">fankowsky: Black Spirits, White Saints 407 9. See, for instance, the articles and interviews in the special issue "Africanit? du Maghreb" in Africultures 13 (December 1998), where Tunisian writer Abdelwahab Meddeb, French so ciologist Georges Lapassade, and Moroccan gn?wa musician Amazigh Kateb, each, in separate interviews, make this claim. 10. "The Negro nations are, as a rule, submissive to slavery," wrote Ibn Khaldun, because they "have attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals" (1967:301). 11 .These divisions were further reified in the French colonizers' use o?Afrique noire and Afrique blanche, terms that are as widely accepted in the upper echelons of Tunisian academia as they are in daily newspapers and vernacular parlance. 12. In Tunisia, as with many other postcolonial states of the Middle East and North Africa, matters of culture are inevitably matters of state. Although fervent nationalist cultural policies led to the invention of the "national" ma'l?f tradition in the mid-twentieth century (see Davis 1997), the debate over defining and celebrating the uniqueness of "Tunisian" culture is still a hot one, especially with the Libyan and Algerian Islamist "problems" always looming just across the country's borders. 13.The French transliteration, as found on signposts and the written word, is Hammam Lif. 14. For an exhaustive listing of North African bori spirits and their northern Nigerian counterparts, see Tremearne (1914). 15.The categories of black and white are especially common in possession cults in Muslim Africa, with "black" spirits being pagan and from the bush, while "white" spirits are Muslim and from the village. This distinction between black and white is common to the Hausa bori, in which "white" spirits are settled in towns and are believers, and the "black" spirits are under stood to be from the bush and are non-believers in Islam. In stambeli, however, the black/white distinction takes on a character that is a unique product of specific historical, geographical, and socio-cultural confluences, and, just as the "black" bori spirits can appear "white" and vice-versa, so too can the boundaries between "black" and "white" be blurred in stambeli. 16. Even when ceremonies involve men and women, the genders are physically and spiritu ally separated while sonically unified. The weekly ceremonies at the z?wiya of Sidi Beihassan in Tunis involve only men and begin with the chanting of the hizb (a religious chant that in corporates verses of the Qur'an and praises of God). This is followed by a dhikr, the repetitive chanting of the name of God, which is performed with increasing intensity and is accompanied by the regulated swaying of the body What is significant for the present discussion is that, in an adjacent room is a gathering of women who, sealed off visually from the men, take part in the same ritual, but become possessed by jn?n (spirits; sing. jinn). The chants performed by the men order the women's ritual experience, but the women respond by dancing and becoming possessed. The men create the sonic context of the fully female gathering. 17.Tunisia, unlike its Maghrebi neighbors, has no critical mass of Berber speakers. The Berber language, considered by linguists to be "nearly dead" in Tunisia, is spoken by less than one percent of the population and is limited to informal speech between family and friends in only a few villages in the rural south and among some migrants to the capital, Tunis. This is in stark contrast to Morocco and Algeria, where the "domains of Berber" include television, radio, recordings, newspapers, magazines, and are used in the institutes of education and religious practice (Battenburg 1999). In Tunis and in the deep south, whenever I raised the topic of Berber music in Tunisia, I met unanimous agreement that the Arabization of Berbers in Tunisia was complete, and no remnants of Berber culture remained apart from some rural "curiosities" in tourist villages of the south. 18.This is not to be confused with the n?ba of ma'l?f, the Tunisian classical art music. In ma'l?f, n?ba refers to an entire cycle of songs in the same melodic mode. The use of the term n?ba in both genres, however, is not happenstance, as both refer to successive musical entities. For the n?ba of ma'l?f, see Davis (2004:2-10). 19"Black" and "white" here do not refer to specific melodic modes, as they do in Maurita nia, where "black,""white," and "mixed" modes are tonally differentiated and must be played in</page><page sequence="36">408 Ethnomusicology, Fall 2006 a specific order (Guignard 2005). The deployment of blackness and whiteness in musics of the Black Sahara?where north and south are often described in terms of color?is intriguing and begs for comparative research. 20.Though P?ques (1964) suggests he is Bu Hajba, the barber venerated in the interior town of Gabes. 21. Most North Africans use s?lih/salhin interchangeably with wal?/awliya' to refer to a Muslim saint. Indeed, the two terms are often combined into the phrase watt s?lih, or holy saint. The distinction between the two, however, is crucial in the stambeli context. 22.As with other spirit groups, there is some slippage in terminology when categorizing the Kuri spirits. It appears to me that what is now considered the Kuri group is an amalgamation of two closely related spirit groups, the Banu Kuri (Kuri's Children) and il-Amawet (Those of Ami). 23. According toTrimingham,Lake Chad, the great lake of Bornu, was also known as "Kuri." SeeTrimingham (1962). Tremearne (1914) notes that Kuri was chief of the pagan spirits. 24. Cf. Rahal (2000), who claims that all the spirits are Muslim. 25. In Tunisia, the mattanza sacrifice at the shrine of Sidi Daoud, introduced by Italian tuna fishermen, continues to be performed annually at the beginning of the tuna fishing season (seeAmmairia 1996). Like the trans-Saharan movement described in the present essay, this trans Mediterranean movement demonstrates the compatibility of certain rituals and beliefs, though between southern Europe and North Africa in this case. 26.This is not to suggest that the spirits are open to any interpretation, or that these in terpretations are not contested. In an interview filmed in the documentary Stambali: Un rite Africain en Tunisie, a. male 'arifa, possessed by May Gajiya, describes her effect on him:"She is a lunatic woman. She makes me act crazy." The Dar Barnu folks see this as indication of the illegitimacy of this 'arifa's work."May Gajiya cannot act like that," I was told,"because she is one of the Beyet. They are good and proper."
