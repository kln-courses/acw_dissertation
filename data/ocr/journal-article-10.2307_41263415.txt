Yet the specific participants and the exact nature of their contact remains in doubt (Coe 1962b: 181; Lathrap 1966:275). A brief review of the more salient instances of suspected Preclassic con- nections between the cultures of these two areas will prepare the ground for the primary purpose of this paper, which is to trace the ori- gin of certain possibly exotic components of a single art style, that of Izapa. The earliest evidence of Mesoamerican im- pact on Peru comes with the introduction of maize and other cultigens in the Preceramic Stage (Lanning 1967:75). At a later date ele- ments of a few Initial Period Andean ceramics (ca. 1400 B.C.) find correspondences in some an- cient Mexican complexes.1 But it is the possible connection between the art of the Olmec cul- ture of Veracruz (ca. 1200-600 B.C.) and that of Chavin de Huantar in the northern highlands of Peru (ca. 1200-300 B.C.) that has generated the greatest amount of interest and dispute. lathrap mentions that a number of characteristics en- countered in Early Guanape, Haldas, and Chira vessels (ca. 1400 B.C.) find parallels in those of Chiapa de Corzo I. Curayacu I designs also have an early Mesoamerican quality duplicated in Chiapa de Corzo I and Early Zacatenco; and a few pre-Chavin solid handmade figurines, especially one from Las Haldas, bear similarity to types from Tres Zapotes (Lathrap 1966:269-70). Postulating an association in the case of two such widely separated and important styles poses numerous problems. In the present case these are compounded by the fact that Olmec and Chavin have been considered pristine cul- tures which exerted a seminal influence on the subsequent development of civilization in their areas. Consequently the autonomy or so-called cultural integrity of each is stoutly defended (Lanning 1967:100-1). Still a number of stu- dents feel that Olmec and Chavin art are in some way related. Initially this opinion was based on the presence of general corre- spondences in style and subject matter. Chavin and Olmec carvers employed precise incised lines and a peculiar combination of soft curves and rectangular shapes with rounded corners (Covarrubias 1957:54). A highly stylized feline was very frequently rendered in both traditions, and raptorial birds and serpents also make repeated appearances (della Santa 1959:340- 59). 2 As noted, these parallels are rather general, and hence to many scholars, not fully convinc- ing of Olmec-Chavin connections (Lathrap 1966:273, 275; Lanning 1963: 100; Kidder, Lum- breras and Smith 1963:94). However, more arbi- trary and specific instances of similarity be- tween Olmec and Chavin art exist - similari- ties that do support the likelihood of historical 2For a general list of similarities in material culture be- tween Olmec and Chavin, see Ford 1969:190. 3</page><page sequence="4">relationship. Simply the presence of feline sub- ject matter may not be very impressive, but this does not complete the analogy. The manner in which this image was rendered must be consid- ered, too. Delia Santa (1959:361) has observed an X inscribed between the fangs of a Chavin cat comparable to that often encountered in sty- lized Olmec jaguar masks (the so-called St. An- drew's cross). An even higher degree of conver- gence in feline representation is evident when one turns to the famous seated Olmec human figurine from Atlihuayan, Morelos, that wears a fantastic jaguar skin draped over its back (Fig. la and b). The flayed animal's head has a pair of flame-scroll eyebrows similar in type to those of many Chavin cats (Fig. 28), and its tail, di- vided into a series of horizontal segments, also finds echoes in Peruvian examples (Fig. 2). Per- haps most noteworthy are the pelage markings on the jaguar's skin. They have been reduced to a series of simple crosses, a stylized device com- mon to the pelts of Chavin felines as well (Fig. 2).3 Additional surface decorations shared by Olmec and Chavin art include figure-eight scrolls - like those sported by the cornice cats on the New Temple at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 28) and also carved into Chalcatzingo Petrog- lyph 5 - and a curious kind of face marking. The latter motif, which is incised on numerous anthropomorphic Olmec jades (Fig. 24) has re- cently been identified as characteristic of the God of Spring, Xipe (Coe 1968a: 111, 114). This tattoo-like configuration is a double band that passes vertically through the eye and down along the cheek. It reappears in Chavin works, such as the upturned head of the hawklike being carved on the north column of the Black-and- White Portal of the temple at Chavin de Huan- tar (Fig. 23) and on the more humanoid figures 3Heine-Geldern (1959] has compared bronze tigers of the Chinese Shang period to Chavin stone mortars in jaguar form. The possible connection between Olmec and Chavin culture does not exclude the further possibility of trans-Pa- cific influence from ancient China, but this problem is far too complex to be dealt with here. that embellish a soapstone Cupisnique tumbler in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection (Fig. 38). The cheek-strap design is also found at Cerro Sechin in the Casma Valley, in whose carved figures Smith, in an unpublished master's essay, has found what he believes to be Olmec elements (Kidder, Lumbreras and Smith 1963:94). A final comparison will end this admittedly superficial survey of Olmec and early Peruvian artistic similarities. A blackware bottle from Kotosh in the Central Andean highlands bears a design of an ear of maize (Fig. 3a). According to Coe, this almost-glyphic corn motif is quite at home in Mexico where it frequently appears on Olmec jade celts (Fig. 3b) but is extremely unusual for Peru. Consequently, he reasons, it must be intrusive in the latter area, and since the vessel it appears on comes from a phase im- mediately preceding the Chavin Horizon (Ko- tosh IV),4 he feels that the occurrence of the maize motif indicates the presence of Olmec in- fluence at a sufficiently early date to have been critical in the development of Chavin culture. "The chances are very good," Coe writes, "that all New World civilizations, including Chavin, have a single point of origin on the Gulf Coast plain of southern Mexico" (Coe 1962a:580). Elsewhere Coe elaborates this theory vis-a-vis Olmec and Chavin art to conform to the follow- ing developmental model: Mesoamerica intro- duced into Peru a ceramic complex, the snarling jaguar cult, and the Olmec art style. The Olmec sculptural style merged with a native Peruvian tradition based on iconographic features such as the condor and double-headed monster, motifs already found at the Preceramic Period site of Huaca Prieta (ca. 2000 B.C.), to produce the art of Chavin (Coe 1963:101-4). Olmec art may indeed have affected that of Chavin,- but, even if this influence was as exten- sive as Coe proposes, it is important to bear in 4In rebuttal, Lanning maintains that, while the vessel is pre-Chavm at Kotosh, this does not mean that it is chrono- logically pre-Chavin in Peru as a whole (Lanning 1963: 100). 4</page><page sequence="5">mind that both traditions were for a long time contemporaneous. If contact between them oc- curred, is it necessary to suppose that it took place solely during a period when only one could be the beneficiary of the other? Coe him- self has eloquently put the case against looking at diffusion as a one-sided affair (Coe 1960:364- 5). The double-headed monster is, after all, a very ancient Peruvian device (Bird 1963:29-34). 5 Yet it appears on a unique Olmec find (Fig. 10) associated with the latest period (IV) at La Venta, ca. 600 B.C. (Drucker, Heizer and Squier 1959:274; Coe 1968a:66, 148). And the cross- shaped spots on the jaguar pelt worn by the Atli- huayan figurine, a work of undetermined age, are characteristic of Chavin, not Olmec, feline skins. Maybe both the two-headed serpent and the pelage markings are evidence of Andean reciprocity. While this reciprocity is perhaps only sporadically evident in Olmec art, espe- cially during the early Middle Preclassic Period, recent findings may indicate that Peruvian in- fluence was well established in Mesoamerica by late Middle Preclassic times, that is to say, well before the Classic and Postclassic Periods when its impact is generally acknowledged (Lathrap 1966:274-5). A glance at work done in the Valley of Mexico and Morelos will illustrate this point. Porter specifically compared Chavinoid Cupisnique ceramics from Peru to those from Tlatilco in the Valley of Mexico and identified numerous in- stances of similar vessel adornment and vessel shape. In the former category are such traits as zone-and-panel decoration, excised ware, and rocker stamping. Parallels in vessel forms con- sist of, among others, flat-bottomed, straight- sided bowls, effigy vessels, bottles, whistling pots, and, most strikingly, stirrup-spouted jars - a type of container that is almost diagnos- tic of North Peruvian pottery. In Porter's view the similar traits in Tlatilco and Chavin argue for historic connections (Porter 1953:71-9). The direction in which these traits supposedly dif- fused has never been stated with absolute cer- tainty, but most experts have felt that the evi- dence favors transmission from north to south (Coe 1962a:579; Kidder, Lumbreras and Smith 1963:94; Lathrap 1966:272; Ford 1969:189). One reason for this conclusion is that the Tla- tilco specimens in question have long been as- sociated with Olmec culture, whose earliest dates (ca. 1200 B.C.), were until recently thought to precede those of Chavin by several centuries (Coe, Diehl and Stuiver 1967; Lan- ning 1967:26-7, 96). Therefore Mexican works could be interpreted as influencing Peruvian development rather than the reverse. That this, however, need not be the case, at least so far as stirrup-spouted vessels were concerned, was soon indicated by the fact that such jars occur earliest in the Machalilla style of southern Ecuador (ca. 2000-1500 B.C.).6 Therefore the possibility that the stirrup spout diffused from Ecuador both to the north and south has been entertained (Ford 1969:187; Kidder, Lumbreras and Smith 1963:93-4; Lanning 1967:101; Evans and Meggers 1966:246-7; Coe 1960:368, 372). Recent excavations may modify the picture still further. An analysis of the ceramics unearthed at the San Pablo mound in Morelos, which are identical to certain vessels from Tlatilco, sug- gests to Grove (1970) that Tlatilco and other sites of its type show not one but at least two phases. Only the earlier one is related to high- land Olmec (see also Tolstoy and Paradis 1970:347, 349-51) and it is devoid of stirrup- spouted vessels! The San Pablo mound, dated at roughly 900-500 B.C., seems to represent the second later phase, and it does have containers with the stirrup spout. Grove holds that Meso- 5This motif also occurs at a very early date in China as Covarrubias has noted (Covarrubias 1954:45, Fig. 18). The circum -Pacific distribution of the double-headed serpent motif is traced in Fraser 1968:57-64. Its meaning and origin in the art of the Northwest Coast of America is discussed in Badner and Heine-Geldern 1966:15-18, 24-5. 6Coe says that the earliest stirrup spouted vessels in the New World belong to the Valdivia phase in Ecuador. Lathrap is not satisfied that these examples are sufficiently well documented and reserves judgment (Coe 1960:368; Lathrap 1966:272). 5</page><page sequence="6">american stirrup-spouted vessels are post- Olmec, thus explaining the puzzlement of scholars at their absence in actual Olmec sites. He concludes that introduction of this new ves- sel form (plus some others) may reflect outside cultural influences from an as-yet-undeter- mined area (Grove 1970:62-72). Considering the time that separates Ecuadorian Machalilla and post-Olmec Tlatilco, could this source be Peru, perhaps during one of the phases of the Chavfn Horizon? Of course, in seeking a place that might have been a focus for Andean influence in either Middle or Late Preclassic Meso- america, it is not landlocked Morelos, site of the San Pablo mound, that naturally attracts atten- tion, but rather the Pacific Coast, where direct sea contact with Peru would have been more likely.7 Subsequent to the final abandonment of La Venta (ca. 600-500 B.C.), the last great classic nuclear Olmec center in Tabasco, a new major art style emerged in Mesoamerica. It has been named after its type site, Izapa, which is located on the Pacific Coastal Plain close to the Chiapas-Guatemalan border. Nearby, El Jobo, Abaj Takalik, Chocala, El Baul, and Kaminal- juyu are among other sites that possess Izapan style monuments (Miles 1965). More distant, and this time situated to the west, an obviously intrusive object with distinct Izapan charac- teristics has been recovered at Chiapa de Corzo (Agrinier 1960:11; Bernal 1969:168-9), and even further afield the style is represented at Tres Zapotes in Veracruz (Stirling 1943:72-3; Pros- kouriakoff 1968:123; Coe 1965a:696; 1965c: 773). Three radiocarbon dates of 150 B.C. obtained from the stela-producing level at Izapa seem to indicate that fully mature Izapan monuments were made around the first and second cen- turies B.C. (Easby and Scott 1970:94-5). How- ever, the origin of the style must surely be ear- lier, though precisely how much earlier is not clear. Indirect evidence in the form of Izapan- style finds in secure Miraflores Phase contexts at Kaminaljuyu has indicated a Late Preclassic date going back to 300 B.C. (Miles 1965:255; Coe 1965c:772; Borhegyi 1965:13-14). Even greater antiquity is possible. Miles, whose essay on Guatemala-Chiapas and Pacific Slope sculp- ture is still the most thorough available, di- vides the Preclassic Period of this entire area into four subdivisions8 which she feels cor- respond roughly to major ceramic phases (Miles 7Chard argued against the existence of significant long- distance sea contact along the Pacific coast from Middle to South America (Chard 1950:9-16) before Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki expedition and before Pre-Columbian sherds were found on the Galapagos Islands, six hundred miles from the nearest shore (Coe 1960:384-5). Since then it has become increasingly evident to experts such as Evans and Meggers that contact must have repeatedly taken place between Me- soamerica and the west coast of South America starting in Early Preclassic times and gaining intensity in the centuries just before the Conquest. It seems that in South America the principal area of contact centered around the north coast of Ecuador, perhaps because the Humboldt Current im- peded navigation farther south (Evans and Meggers 1966:263). Lanning holds that the coastal raft trade routes did not extend into Peru and says there is no evidence of ocean-going craft at all in the Initial Period between 1800 and 900 B.C. (Lanning 1967:87). Nevertheless, Coe has pos- tulated that a long-range maritime trading network had been established between the Pacific Coast of Mesoamerica and Ecuador at a sufficiently early date that this route or an extension of it may have been used by Olmecs or Olme- coids to reach Peru as early as 1000 B.C. (Coe 1963:104). There is certainly good reason not to underestimate the ca- pacity of ancient peoples to undertake long arduous sea journeys, especially in the case of South America, where so- phisticated vessels were in use at the time of European dis- covery. Pizarro's pilot captured a heavily laden Peruvian balsa raft. When sighted, the large, elaborately outfitted craft was beating up against the wind and the strong Nino Current. Inca seamen could venture far into the perilous rapids of the Humboldt and Nino Currents with the aid of guara, movable center boards, whose use enabled rafts to perform all the manoeuvres of a regular ship. Heyerdahl identifies as guara a number of flat boards often thought to be ceremonial digging sticks (Lanning 1967:168) which have been recovered from lea, Paracas, and Chimu area burials (Heyerdahl 1959:334-5). Though the actual antiq- uity of highly skilled navigation in South America is not known, its indigenous nature militates in favor of the prop- osition that early pre-Inca people were capable of traveling long distances over water. 8The fourth extends into the Early Classic. 6</page><page sequence="7">1965:242, 273). Division One is associated with Las Charcas (600-500 B.C.); Two, with Provi- dencia (500-300 B.C.); and Three and Four, with Miraflores (300 B.C.-A.D. 200) and Arenal (300 B.C.-A.D. 300). 9 Some of the Izapan carvings to be dealt with in this paper are ascribed by Miles to Division Two, that is to say, a period equiva- lent to ca. 500-300 B.C. Whether Miles' style- evolutionary analysis, a system based on formal criteria, is correct cannot yet be determined,10 but it may be noted that the initiatory date of 500 B.C. for Division Two harmonizes with data contained in the most recent archae- ological report on Izapa (Ekholm 1969). A chronological chart in this publication indi- cates that the Late Preclassic Period, during whose florescence most of the site's famous carved stone monuments must have been erected, occupies a time block stretching from 500-100 B.C. (Ekholm 1969:4, 19). 11 Evidently Izapan chronology is still fluid, and adjustments are to be expected, but this much is clear: the Late Preclassic association commonly attri- buted to the Izapan style still seems secure even if the style's precise antiquity and development within this period remains in doubt. The antiquity of the Izapan style is certainly reflected in the similarity it bears to Olmec 9The dates supplied here are based on Borhegyi 1965:57. 10The latest published material available to me states that no evidence to refute or support Miles's system has been found so far (Lee and Lowe n.d. : 15). investigations under the auspices of the New World Ar- chaeological Foundation were conducted at Izapa between 1962-65. Several excavation reports are in preparation; but only Susanna Ekholm 's publication, which deals primarily with Early and Middle Preclassic ceramics, has appeared at this writing. Ekholm does not attempt an analysis of Late Preclassic material; nevertheless, the general chronology that accompanies her work includes a division for the Late Preclassic. 12Coe thinks the Izapan style may even have originated near or within the Olmec climax region rather than on the Pacific coast (Coe 1965c:773). His opinion notwithstand- ing, and despite chronological problems, a study of possible Izapan influence on Late Olmec monuments such as those at Chalcatzingo and some at La Venta could prove fruitful. See Proskouriakoff 1968: 123. art.12 Shared traits include scenes contained within a stylized jaguar mouth, the realistic depiction of plump human forms, a frequent use of the St. Andrew's cross, a repeated occurrence of the U element, scrollwork clouds, and the flame-scroll brow (Coe 1965c:759, 773). At the same time, however, Izapan art exhibits numer- ous elements unknown or uncommon in Olmec works. Its carvings are done primarily in relief and in a florid curvilinear style. Altars are set up in front of stelae.13 But the most noticeable changes are iconographic. Subject matter ex- plodes. The comparatively limited, oft-repeated repertory of the Olmec artist - man, bird, were- jaguar, jaguar, and snake - is superseded by a host of fantastic, occasionally unique images part animal, human, and vegetable. These are often combined in equally fantastic and puz- zling compositions charged with drama and movement. A masked fisherman with animal- head feet, grotesque diving bird-men, dragons - both double-headed and entwined - saurians, and rubbery trees laden with fruit are all depicted. It is now generally accepted that many Izapan elements - its stela-altar complex, serpent- dragon, and curvilinear mode, to mention a few - influenced the Mayans so that Izapan style is regarded "as a connecting link in time and space between the Olmec civilization and the Classic Maya which came after" (Bushnell 1965:27). To Coe, the process of transmission is almost directly linear from the Olmec. One can hardly express this position more clearly than in his own words: It is here suggested that all known major art styles of lowland Mesoamerica have a single origin in the Olmec style. . . . From this was derived the Izapan style of the Late Preclassic, which spread across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the Pacific slope and lowlands. In and near the low- 13Stirling found only one instance of a stela with an altar in the Veracruz-Tehuantepec region, namely, at Tres Zapotes, anlzapa-influenced site (Stirling 1943:73]. See also Bernal 1969:172. 7</page><page sequence="8">lands of Southern Veracruz and Tabasco, this Izapan style evolved independently into the Early Classic art of Cerro de las Mesas. . . . From the Pacific slope, Izapan art eventually spread southeast and up across the Valley of Guatemala and down into the Peten lowlands, where it could have given rise to the earliest known Mayan art. The ultimate relation of Classic Maya with Olmec can therefore be traced through the medium of the Izapan style (Coe 1965c:773; see also Coe 1968a:121; 1968b:63). In this view Izapan art is but a continuation of Olmec and differs from it because of a process of gradual stylistic evolution similar to the in- evitable "classic" and "baroque" cycles that Wolfflin postulated for European painting (Coe 1965c:774). The pivotal position that the Izapan style probably occupies in the history of Mesoameri- can art makes the question of its pure Olmec pedigree a critical one. Can the many intricate elements found in it which have little in com- mon with earlier Olmec work (Proskouriakoff 1968:123; Bernal 1969:12) be accounted for on the basis of evolution alone? If so, we must credit Izapan-Olmec culture with a series of in- novations in complex iconography and compo- sition at least as rich and revolutionary as were those made by the original Olmec themselves. This would constitute a literally unparalleled example of sustained (1200 years) independent invention by a single artistic tradition. Pros- kouriakoff's words strike to the heart of the matter: No civilization has arisen from a single focus. ... Its genesis is the interaction of cultures, and no isolated and homogeneous culture has ever risen much beyond its orig- inal level (Proskouriakoff 1968:1 19). In view of the above, it seems unlikely that, after six or seven hundred years of slow develop- ment, and after the abandonment of the centers in which it first flourished, Olmec art should 8 suddenly have blossomed along the Pacific Coast into a new form, unaided. Surely the Izapan style must have arisen out of an Olmec tradition enriched by contact with other artistic modes (Bernal 1969:12). If the close similarities between highly complex, arbitrary motifs dis- cussed below is any indication, some of these ultimately stemmed from Peru. An exhaustive comparison of the sculpture of the Guatemala-Chiapas Highlands and Pacific Slopes with that of possibly relevant Andean styles is rendered impractical because the Mesoamerican material is as yet inadequately published and illustrations (usually of poor quality) are widely scattered, hence difficult to assemble. The most accessible images are those from Kaminaljuyu and from Izapa itself. For this reason almost all the monuments here cited are limited to some of the better-known examples from these two sites. Even this restricted sam- pling, however, is rich in motifs and offers ample opportunity for noting congruences with early Peruvian art. These congruences will be described in order of increasing complexity, moving from isolated conventions to composi- tional ensembles. That hallmark of classic Olmec style, the snarling were-jaguar mouth, underwent exten- sive modification and variation into many types at the hands of Izapan craftsmen (see Miles 1965:Figs. 2 and 3). Three types are of particular interest here. One is especially well illustrated in Kaminaljuyu Stela 10 (Miles 1965:255), a par- tially destroyed Miraflores Phase (Miles Pre- classic Division Three) relief that has recently been attributed to Protoclassic times, i.e., 100 B.C.-A.D.100 (Easby and Scott 1970:102). Represented in profile at the upper-right-hand corner of what remains of the composition is a large bearded and helmeted anthropomorphic personage (Fig. 4). His mouth is curled up at the corner revealing a sharp backward-sweeping fang preceded by a full set of teeth. These fea- tures differ considerably from the typical</page><page sequence="9">Olmec were-jaguar mouth which is charac- terized by a rounded fleshy upper lip depressed at the ends and toothless gums with a stressed medial alveolar ridge. In those instances when canines are indicated in Olmec works (as in the Kunz Axe) they are usually rectangular or cleft at the ends (Coe 1965c: 757; 1965b: 14), not pointed as in the Kaminaljuyu relief, and they are set into an alveolus otherwise devoid of teeth. Actually the mouth of the bearded char- acter in Stela 10 compares more closely to that carved on the famous Lanzon or "Smiling God" (Rowe 1962:9, 19) found at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 5) than it does to any Olmec prototype. Points of similarity are not only common, grin- ning, upturned corners, sharp backward-curved fangs, and a full set of dentures, but the general configuration of the lips as well. In contrast to the classic Olmec maw, whose thick upper lip tapers to a point at the ends where it meets its narrower lower counterpart (Fig. la), the lips on both the Lanzon and the Stela 10 bearded per- sonage are rendered as a continuous straplike outline of virtually undeviating width that stretches entirely around the mouth. Some- what greater modulation is apparent in the Ka- minaljuyu example,- still, the top and bottom lip are essentially the same thickness which de- creases only slightly as they merge in a seamless curve behind the rear fang of the grimacing face. A second set of Chavm-Izapan similarities in the manner of representing a fanged, dentated maw can be pointed out by considering some nonanthropomorphic images that appear on two of four human femurs found in Tomb 1 at Chiapa de Corzo. While the tomb itself belongs to the Chiapa VI Period, thought to correspond to 100-1 B.C., the carved bones in question are clearly Izapan in style and were probably Late Preclassic heirlooms acquired through trade (Agrinier 1960:23; Bernal 1969:168-9; Miles 1965:257). Bone 3 has, among the several figures embellishing it, one (Fig. 6) which has been identified as some sort of saurian or alligator- monster seen from directly above (Agrinier 1960:15-16). Along the animal's body axis are four overlapping, longitudinally striated, wing- or beard-like appendages14 that terminate in the beast's large head, which is roughly oval in shape. At the broad or neck portion of this tapered oval rests a flat featherlike form15 whose base is flanked by two eyes inscribed in scrolls. Below, circular nostrils are indicated and still farther forward at the narrow end of the oval is a U-shaped muzzle with rectangular upper teeth protruding between a pair of pointed out- flaring fangs. The convention of representing U- snouted monster-heads seen from above is fre- quently encountered on reliefs from Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 8). In addition to other complex traits typical of this style but irrelevant here,16 such creatures are endowed with scroll-shaped eyebrows, rounded teeth, and outward-ex- tended canines similar to those of the Chiapa saurian. Although Chavin U-snouted monsters appear only in the role of subsidiary design ele- ments (Bennett 1942:5), the Chiapa de Corzo beast can also be compared to a large monument from Chavin de Huantar with which it shares some vague congruences - the Raimondi Stone (Fig. 9). The lower third of the Raimondi Stone is occupied by a humanoid form that stands in a full-face symmetrical pose and holds a staff in either hand. Rising vertically from the top of the being, who has been identified as a deity (Rowe 1962:19), is an extraordinarily convoluted rep- resentation of hair or a headdress which fills the remaining portion of the composition. When turned upside-down, this head ornament is eas- ily read as a number of fanged U-snouted mon- 14They are very deeply undercut. Agrinier (1960:17) sup- poses that this was done to indicate that they be viewed as appendages that are raised or stand out from the body. 15Perhaps a flattened horn or dorsal fin (Agrinier 1960:7]. 16Many representations at Chavin de Huantar are en- crusted with innumerable secondary motifs. This compari- son of the Chiapa de Corzo saurian to Chavin U-snouted monsters draws parallels only between what might be termed core similarities, i.e., those basic to the primary image concept. 9</page><page sequence="10">ster maws viewed from above, each similar to the Chiapa saurian. The snouts are arranged in an ascending series in which one emerges from that directly behind it and partially overlaps the one immediately in front. This produces an in- sistent, repetitive rhythm of forms, reminiscent of the segmented plates on a lobster tail. Of course, the Chiapa de Corzo Bone 3 beast has only a single head, but its highly conven- tionalized body is constructed of an overlapping series of tapered shapes that seem to echo re- motely yet significantly, the compositional principal of the Raimondi Stone head orna- ment. The saurian depicted from above on Bone 3 is evidently rendered in profile on its compan- ion piece, Bone 1 (Agrinier 1960:16-17). A sec- ond view of the beast's head from another angle discloses previously hidden elements and af- fords opportunity for discussion of a third Izapan mode for depicting the mouth. Seen from the side (Fig. 7), the Chiapa de Corzo monster's muzzle consists of a long upper snout distended by an enlarged alveolus that curves down and over the teeth to form a forward-protruding hook that surmounts a barely discernible, un- dentated lower jaw. A vestigial lower jaw, in- deed its total absence, is not unusual in Izapan images (see Miles 1965:Figs. 2b and d, 3e and h) and finds a parallel in Chavin art where ag- nathic heads and faces are commonplace (Rowe 1962: 15-17, 19, 20). The dilated alveolus and/or alveolar bar is actually one of the hallmarks of Izapan style and is present on many carvings in numerous variations (Miles 1965:251; Coe 1965c:773). In some cases the alveolus is so dis- tended that it forms a long, downward-pointing central fang (Miles 1965:256, Figs. 2b and i, 3b,c,e,h). This curious convention might be traced exclusively to the stressed medial alveo- lar ridge of the Olmec were-jaguar mouth (Fig. 10). But why should such an extreme distortion of a relatively realistic motif have occurred? In this regard it may be noteworthy that Chavin mouths of the earliest style phase already dis- play a central protruding fang as a prominent 10 iconographic feature (see Figs. 9, 21, 23, 27; Rowe 1962: 17). 17 Some sort of acquaintance with this motif on the part of Izapan craftsmen could have provided them with the impetus necessary to metamorphose the well-known medial alveolar ridge into a long pointed tooth. The Chiapa de Corzo saurian described above is merely one relatively tame example of many reptilian monsters encountered in Izapan art. Dragon-headed serpentlike creatures were, in fact, a favorite symbolic motif both as a single subject and as part of more complex composi- tions carved in this style (Miles 1965:242). Sev- eral variations of the Izapan reptile theme have Peruvian analogues. Among them are the dou- ble-headed dragon or monster, the undulating monster, the entwined dragon, and the monster that flowers into a plant. Each may be consid- ered in turn. Izapa Stelae 1, 5, 11, and 12 (Stirling 1943:62, 64, 67-8) all have some kind of double-headed serpentine creature included in their composi- tions.18 In Izapa Stela 1 (Fig. 30), the creature functions as a horizontal ground-line that sup- ports a scene carved above it. The remaining three monuments, Stelae 5 (Fig. 47), 11, and 12 (Fig. 49), show the monster's body curving up at the ends to form a U. We recall that this out- line corresponds roughly to that of an incised double-headed serpent present on an Olmec ear spool associated with the last building phase at La Venta (Fig. 10). Tempting as it is to consider this example ancestral to the Izapan forms, cer- tain factors caution against uncritical accept- ance of such a proposition. The Olmec work is unique and small; it has a third central face which is absent in the Izapan versions, and its 17Rowe says that the presence of a central tooth on faces shown in profile is a relatively late Chavin characteristic (Rowe 1962:6). In any case, both in its early and late mani- festation, the Chavin version enjoys ample chronological priority over its Izapan counterparts. 18A very clear depiction of this monster is also present on the great stela of El Meson, central Veracruz, which, while probably of relatively late date, still bears a strong Izapan imprint (Covarrubias 1957:Fig. 68).</page><page sequence="11">U-shaped silhouette is at least partially deter- mined by the circular surface it decorates. Moreover, the piece is late (La Venta IV), and it is just conceivable that this singular Olmec double-headed monster reflects Pacific Coast influence rather than the reverse (Proskouria- koff 1968:121-3; Bernal 1969:173; Benson 1968:116-17). Or, it could be that several An- dean contacts brought the double-headed snake to Mesoamerica at different times where it was first adopted by the Olmec and later more intensely embraced by the cultures of the Pa- cific Coast of Guatemala and Chiapas. In Peru, as already noted, the double-headed serpent makes an extremely early debut at Huaca Prieta and becomes a staple in many subsequent styles.19 Oddly, clear Chavin specimens of the double- headed monster are hard to find, perhaps be- cause they are partially obscured in the bewil- dering multiplicity of images that encrust most Chavin representations. A possible instance of the two-headed beast can be seen in the crea- tures that encircle the central face of a gold Lambayeque pectoral now in the collection of the Museum of the American Indian, New York (Rowe 1962:P1. 26). The body and head of the fanged Staff God embossed on a famous gold plaque at the Museo Rafael Larco Herrera also seem to be combined with double-headed snakes (Fig. 11). By far the most distinct Chavin version of the double-headed serpent that I have been able to locate is carved on the broken piece of a ceremonial mortar found in the Great Temple at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 12). This stone fragment is embellished with a frontal fig- ure who wears a headdress composed of an eas- ily decipherable but rather domesticated-look- ing variant of the two-headed snake. Such a head ornament is quite popular in Moche de- signs and it makes a dramatic Mesoamerican appearance on a post-Olmec plaque from San 19Moche, Paracas, Nazca, and particularly the great curved serpent at Huaca Dragon near Chanchan (ca. A.D.1000) come to mind. Jeronimo Costa Grande, Guerrero (Fig. 13). In this instance it is worn by a fanged personage who bears remarkable resemblance, in pose and detail, to the fanged Staff God of the Museo Ra- fael Larco Herrera plaque (Fig. 1 1 ). It is also sim- ilar to Moche depictions of a fanged god. The Pacific Coast of Guerrero may thus have been an area that experienced some Andean influ- ence too. Be that as it may, the search for dou- ble-headed serpent motifs has led far afield and it is necessary to return to Izapa. Delia Santa (1959:353-4, Fig. 16) has com- pared a relief carving of a two-headed jaguar in Chavin style at the Museo Rafael Larco Herrera with the creature at the base of Izapa Stela 1 (Fig. 30). 20 Unfortunately these images share no sim- ilarity beyond their bicephalism . T o begin with, the Chavin specimen reproduces a mammal; the Izapan creature does not - indeed, 'its iden- tity is so complex and ambiguous that it war- rants special consideration. Although the Stela 1 monster fits into the double-headed serpent or dragon category by virtue of its two terminal heads, which are separated by a long "body," other details suggest that the image can be read in alternate ways. The two heads at either end, whose elaborate nose scrolls and eyebrow scal- lops correspond roughly to elements in some Chavin creatures (Tello 1960: Figs. 39, 63, 83, 84 and Pi. XXIX A), do not face in opposite direc- tions. Instead, they confront one another, and their shared body, which consists of wavy paral- lel lines interspersed with fish, can thus be in- terpreted as a stream or "body" of water that issues from both heads. It seems that here the double-headed monster has been employed as a metaphor for living water and its source.21 Metaphoric images are typical of Chavin sculp- 20This comparison was evidently undertaken under the impression that Izapa Stela 1 is Olmec. 21A similar two-headed monster is present at the bottom of Izapa Stela 23 (see Miles 1965 :Fig. 12d). Perhaps the ser- pent on the earlier stage of the main pyramid in the Ciuda- dela at Teotihuacan also expresses a monster-living-waters metaphor, an idea that may have been derived from Izapan or Izapan-like prototypes. 11</page><page sequence="12">ture, a point to be discussed at greater length in another context below. For the moment it will be sufficient to mention that fish accom- pany the bodies of two confronting mythical aquarian reptiles (caymans) carved on the Chavin Yauya Stela (Rowe 1962:P1. 31) as they do the confronting-headed dragon on Izapa Stela 1. If the exact visual configurations of the dou- ble-headed monsters cited in the various ex- amples above do not seem strikingly congruent, somewhat more direct Izapa-Chavin formal correspondences are evident in a deceptively simple subject, the undulating dragon motif. One side of Stela D at Tres Zapotes bears the representation of a serpentine monster (Fig. 15). The creature's head is stamped with typical Izapan traits such as the distended alveolar bar and conventionalized side fang. Curved nostrils and a massive, highly simplified eyebrow are also present. The monster's short snakelike body is constructed of two multi-outlined, hori- zontally oriented S shapes that partially over- lap. Only the rear scroll of each of these is visi- ble. As the second S terminates the dragon's body, the creature's tail does not stick straight out but curls up and back in upon itself. Viewed as silhouette, the combination of slightly flat- tened overlapping scrolls creates a rhythmic meander pattern. Dragon-serpents from the cor- nice at the southwest corner of the New Temple at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 16) are remarkably similar to the Tres Zapotes monster just de- scribed. Far simpler in construction than their Izapan-style counterpart, they nevertheless du- plicate a substantial number of its properties. These include blunt, massively fanged, heavily eyebrowed heads. Equally important, the Chavin dragons have relatively short bodies that form a multi- , in this case, double-outlined meander or undulating pattern that terminates in an inward-curved, scroll-shaped tail. In one known instance at Izapa, at the lower right-hand corner of Stela 7 (Fig. 17; Stirling 1943:66) a serpent-dragon not only undulates but seems literally to braid itself into knots. Un- 12 fortunately, the left half of this image is badly eroded; however, a recent reconstruction of the monument soon to be published by Garth Nor- man, who kindly permitted me access to some of his drawings for study, clearly shows that only a single serpent - not two interwoven - is depicted. This seems strange for the braided, as opposed to undulating, ophidian body is more appropriate to a representation of two entwined snakes than of one.22 Perhaps the single serpent- dragon of Stela 7 evolved from such a paired en- tangled image. Instances of just such a motif on later Veracruz palmas and yokes (see Covarru- bias 1954:Fig. 21; von Winning 1968:Pls. 318-19) and a cylindrical Mayan vase (Fig. 18a) demon- strate its existence in Mesoamerica, and Chavin prototypes may be said to exist. For instance, the hair of the "Smiling God" (Rowe 1962:19) carved in relief on a slab found at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 18) is represented as a series of en- twined snakes. The same configuration is present in the entwined serpents that issue from the mouths of monster heads painted on an lea textile executed in pure Chavin style (Rowe 1962:P1. 30). 23 Perhaps the most recondite rendition of the dragon monster at Izapa shows a plant growing out of the mythical beast's head. In Stela 5 (Fig. 47), the most ambitious work at the site, this is an enormous eight-branched tree that springs from a subterranean dragon, ascends the full height of the relief and acts as the central fea- ture of its extraordinarily intricate composition (Miles 1965:258-9; Stirling 1943:64-5). A more compact, concentrated version of the dragon- plant motif appears on the bottom of Stela 2 22This supposition is supported by innumerable Old World representations of entwined snakes of which those on the classical caduceus are but the best-known example. For more ancient versions of paired interwoven serpents, see, for instance, Campbell 1964: Figs. 1,3; Frankfort 1955: PI. 51c. 23Heine-Geldern has published a Salinar specimen of the entwined monster-serpent motif that corresponds to that on an El Tajin palma. He traces both designs back to ancient Chinese versions encountered on Late Chou bronze vessels (Heine-Geldern 1959:325, Fig. 11; 1966:279, Fig. 5c and d).</page><page sequence="13">(Stirling 1943:63). Here (Fig. 20) the monster's body has been reduced to a single paw appended to a great head out of whose top sprouts a thick, rubbery gourd tree heavily laden with fruit. The origin of the dragon-plant motif at Izapa is not only interesting for its own sake but be- cause the device becomes important in later Mesoamerican art. At Palenque, to mention just one prominent Mayan center, several mon- uments have a form that has been interpreted as a mythical tree springing from a dragon's head (Proskouriakoff 1965:479). 24 As in the central tooth and double-headed ser- pent, there are possible Olmec antecedents for the Izapan flowering dragon. Chalcatzingo Petroglyph 1 (Fig. 19), a colonial Olmec work, may contain germs of the dragon-plant motif. A major element of the composition is a U- shaped combination cave/jaguar mouth in which a figure is seated. At points along the pe- riphery of the cave's enormous maw grow small plants thought to represent maize (Coe 1968a:92-3). Olmec were-jaguar jade celts also sometimes have a highly conventionalized ear of corn rising out of their skull-cleft (Coe 1962a:579). The question is whether the elabo- rate Izapan flowering dragon was derived solely from Olmec models or whether it might be the product of these prototypes reinforced and mod- ified by an outside source. To my knowledge, no Olmec work shows a branched plant, such as found at Izapa, growing out of a head, and the head itself is never that of a dragon or serpent. But precisely these attributes are present on the Tello Obelisk, one of the greatest monuments from Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 21). The Obelisk is a rectangular shaft carved on all four sides. Like the Yauya slab, referred to earlier in con- nection with Izapa Stela 1, it represents a fantas- tic alligator or cayman with a fishlike tail (Rowe 1962:18-1 9). The alligator's body is covered with a bewildering network of subsidiary 24The panel of the Temple of the Cross and the sarcoph- agus lid from the Ruz tomb in the Temple of the Inscrip- tions. images ranging from a complete feline and avian at the snout to an animated seashell and the disjointed parts or heads of bestial creatures on the torso itself. Three of these auxiliary fig- ures can be singled out as being in varying de- grees similar to the Izapan flowering-dragon de- vice. All are blunt-nosed, heavily fanged, disem- bodied monster heads with protruding plant- like extensions. The largest head points upward and has a blooming eight-branched tree, cov- ered with eyes, growing from its mouth.25 An identical creature which spews forth a short twig with distinctly veined leaves is also carved on a mortar fragment from Chavin de Huantar (Tello 1960:Fig. 126A). The second monster head with vegetation on the Tello Obelisk grows a triple flower from just above its nostrils. However, the third and smallest subsidiary image is the most directly analogous to the Izapan dragon-plant motif. It, like the monster at the bottom of Izapa Stela 2, gives rise to a thick clump of vegetation directly out of the top of its head. One final, admittedly tentative comparison based on community of subject matter between an Izapan relief and the Tello Obelisk will con- clude this discussion of flowering reptile motifs. A large, upended alligator is represented on the left side of Izapa Stela 25 (Fig. 26). For the most part the creature is rendered in a natu- ral, highly convincing manner, altogether dif- ferent from the arcane conventionalized mode of the Obelisk cayman. Still, both share one curious element. The Izapan alligator's body does not terminate in a realistic tail as one would expect; instead, it fans out into several twisting branches. The Chavin cayman's cau- dal appendage is similarly inappropriate to the beast, for it is constructed of several rectangles 25Tello identifies this detail as the monster's phallus (Tello 1923b:279-80) - a curious parallel to the plant-like genitals on some Monte Alban Danzantes. The branched object may be symbolic of both vegetation and water. Esther Pasztory, who has written a dissertation on the wall paint- ings at Tepantitla, Teotihuacan, informs me that a multi- branched tree in one of the murals is also filled with eyes. 13</page><page sequence="14">that fan out slightly to form a fish tail. In short, both the Izapa Stela 25 and the Tello Obelisk saurian have broad, equally incongruous rear ends.26 The Izapan menagerie of fantastic creatures is not restricted to reptiles, dragons, and their kin. Monstrous avians combining man and bird properties occur with some frequency. These cannot reasonably be traced to Olmec sources. Two small Olmec-style were-jaguar figurines with raised batlike wings are known,- but they are unique, atypical works from a marginal area, Costa Rica, and probably combine local innova- tion with outside influence (Coe 1965c:753, Fig. 16). Moreover, these little chubby carvings bear virtually no resemblance, formal or expressive, to the dramatic, grotesque, human-avian mon- sters portrayed on Izapa Stelae 11, 9, 4, and 2. 27 In all of these reliefs, with the exception of Stela 9, in which the figure stands erect, the bird-man monster seems to dive head down, wings out- stretched, into the composition below. Unfor- tunately, in most instances the creature is so badly eroded that a very accurate description of specific details is not possible. Miles has recog- nized a scroll headdress and catlike face-mask on one example (Miles 1965:252), and Stirling notes that the plunging personage of Stela 1 1 is equipped with outstretched arms and scrolls rising from each shoulder (Stirling 1943:67). Stela 2 (Fig. 22), 28 while also weathered, ap- parently preserves the clearest rendition of the diving bird-man monster. When the figure is in- verted, it seems to represent a kneeling human wearing a bird costume and a bird-beak mask 26Rowe has commented on the Tello Obelisk fish tail in the following manner: ". . . this mythical detail may be no more than a misunderstanding on the part of artists who were not personally familiar with their subject, caymans oc- curring only at a much lower altitude" (Rowe 1962: 19). 27For Stela 11, Stirling 1943:P1. 53a and Miles 1965:252. For Stelae 9, 4 and 2, Stirling 1943:66, Pis. 56a, 51a, 49b, • Miles 1965:256. 28Miles places Stela 2 in Preclassic Division Four (Miles 1965:257-8). placed on a head turned in profile (Stirling 1943:63). The complex construction of the wings is especially noteworthy. They are fully extended in a heraldic, symmetrical fashion. Every one of the distinctly carved, blade- shaped feathers on each wing is anchored to a commonly shared shoulder panel whose outer end terminates in a now-indistinct, upward- curled form. The bird-man's tail plumage also deserves attention. Instead of descending in a fan-shaped cluster directly beneath the body, as is typical in heraldically conceived birds (the eagle on the Great Seal of the United States is one example), the feathers swing to one side. The diagonal extension thus created exposes the human legs of the bird-man and emphasizes the creature's dual identity. The core imagery of the Izapa Stela 2 compos- ite human-avian is astonishingly similar to that of the guardian "angels" (Rowe 1962: 19) carved in low relief on flanking doorway columns at the Black-and-White Portal of the temple at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 23). 29 These figures clearly portray composite mythical beings. They have the body, legs, and arms of a man but a bird's head and wings (Rowe 1962:19). As in the Izapa Stela 2 "diver" their faces are turned to one side and wear an incongruous-looking raptorial beak (here attached to the otherwise standard, blunt, Chavin jaguar snout). The wings of the "angels" are similar to those of the Izapan bird-man as well. Extended in a symmet- rical, heraldic manner, they too have a small number of large distinct feathers that issue from a shared straplike panel. The outer edge of this panel is decorated with a linked series of tiny heads, the last of which seems to curl slightly up beyond the main body of the wing. In other less dualistic Chavin avians this phenomenon is more pronounced (Rowe 1967:Figs. 12 and 13). Perhaps it is the ultimate source for the scrolls on top of the Izapan "diver's" wings. Like this creature the composite "angels" do 29Della Santa has noted the presence of humans with "condor" wings at Izapa and Chavm (della Santa 1959:355). 14</page><page sequence="15">not have fan-shaped tail plumage, a common feature in other Chavin birds (Rowe 1967:Figs. 12 and 13). Instead, two diagonally extending forms expose the monsters7 human legs, a func- tion analogous to the single sideswept tail clus- ter of the Izapan bird-man. Another bizarre Izapan bird that may be cau- tiously compared to Chavin models appears in the upper right hand of Stela 25 (Fig. 26), diago- nally across from the upended alligator de- scribed earlier. Available photographs disclose little more about this eroded image than its pro- file pose and an S-shaped drooping tail similar to that of the bird-man creature in Stela 2. But a drawing of Stela 25 recently published by Lee and Lowe (n.d.:Fig. 5) and a soon-to-be- published reconstruction by Garth Norman af- ford a somewhat improved view of the mythical avian. It clearly has a single, heavily outlined, raised wing, a horizontal body, and a beaked headdress surmounting a lower face. These at- tributes - profile posture, horizontal body, soli- tary raised wing with shoulder panel, diagonally downward-sloping tail feathers, and a bird beak superimposed on a face - are all present on eagles which decorate the cornice of the Black- and-White Portal at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 27). Parenthetically, the Izapan profile-bird is cov- ered with complex, indecipherable curvilinear elements that may relate to the subsidiary images that encrust Chavin sculpture. The last beast to be discussed in this study will be the jaguar. Some Izapan reliefs are framed by a conventionalized jaguar mouth.30 In other instances the entire animal is represented (Stela 12, Fig. 49; Stirling 1943:67-8). The simi- larity between Olmec and Izapan jaguars has been often commented on (Coe 1965c: 773; Ber- nal 1969:172), and, indeed, there can be no ques- tion that the later Pacific Coast feline was derived from the earlier Veracruz tradition. Yet even this most typically Olmec of all Olmec motifs underwent extensive modification at Izapa. An extremely revealing transformation is evident on Izapa Stela 6 (Fig. 29), which Miles places in Preclassic Division Two (Miles 1965:251; Stirling 1943:65). Carved on this stone is a seated, pot-bellied jaguar whose head has been partially obscured by ancient vandals. The lower portion of the animal remains sub- stantially intact and discloses a rump which ends not in a tail but in a little jaguar head that may have a protruding tongue. This extraor- dinary motif is present in only one other Nu- clear American style - that of Chavin.31 By closely examining the hindquarters of the jag- uar monsters that decorate the cornice at the southwest corner of the temple at Chavin de Huantar and also the feline mortar in the Uni- versity Museum, Philadelphia, Collection (Figs. 2, 28), one can observe that the tail of the creature emerges from the open mouth of a monster mask. This device has been dubbed the "rump-mask" motif (Fraser 1968:109-11) and is an instance of that primary attribute of Chavin style called "kenning" by Rowe. Rowe uses the term kenning to describe the complex metaphoric system of multiple imag- ery employed in Chavin carving. It is a system apparently based on comparison by substitu- tion. Snakes replace hair; a long mouth-band may mark the major axis or outline of a crea- ture. In the most common forms of Chavin ken- ning, a projection of the body - the tail, in the case of the cornice jaguars - is compared to a tongue and therefore shown protruding from the mouth of an extra face placed on the ani- mal's rump. Legs, feet, and wings are treated in the same way and then in turn even kenned themselves (Rowe 1962:15-17). To the erudite initiated viewer the resultant maze of images 30In Izapa Monument 2, however, both jaguar head and the figure contained within its open maw are fully three- dimensional (Stirling 1943:68, PI. 53b; Bernal 1969:172). 31Curiously it is also found on two well known, almost identical bronze Chinese yu vessels in the Sumitomo Col- lection and the Cernuschi Museum, Paris. These works rep- resent seated feline monsters and have been tentatively classified as Late Shang (Fraser 1968 : 1 10- 1 ). 15</page><page sequence="16">forms a cohesive and comprehensible pattern. However, the most obvious visual impact that kenning makes on the untutored eye is simply that secondary faces or heads replace certain normally non-cephalic parts of the body, such as the rump. This is possibly what impressed Izapan craftsmen. It may well account for the isolated rump-mask on the jaguar of Stela 6 and partly for the other curious kennings present in Izapa Stela 1 discussed below. It will be remembered that the base of Stela 1 (Fig. 30), a monument that Miles ascribes to Preclassic Division Two (Miles 1965:252), is decorated with an ambiguous double-headed monster whose horizontal waterlike body sup- ports the remaining composition carved above. This consists of an enigmatic anthropomorphic figure with an unclear bestial face and an olla- shaped basket strapped to his back. He stands slightly bent over at the waist holding a bowl- like net that contains a fish. Attached to the bottom of this implement is a monstrous ag- nathic head (see Miles 1965 :Fig. 2f) with verti- cal lines and scrolls issuing down from its mouth. The image may be a metaphor for water which trickles out of the net and back into the dragon-headed stream below.32 1 know of no spe- cific Chavinoid device similar to this one, but other kennings associated with the net-holding personage, who is identified as a fishing god by Miles (1965:252), have parallels in Chavin sculpture. The deity wears a strangely animated breechcloth with a forward-curling flap that ter- minates in a serpentine head. It is reminiscent and may be an adaptation of the snakes that ex- tend from the waistband of Chavin anthropo- morphic figures such as the Smiling God and the Staff God (Figs. 18, 9). The most blatant ken- ning in Izapa Stela 1 occurs on the deity's feet. They are actually represented as grotesque ag- nathic reptilian heads with heavily dentated 32Perhaps this personage represented on Stela 1 is one of the earliest in a long line of Mesoamerican rainmakers who are shown bending over while at work (Rands 1955: 296-8). upper jaws.33 Astoundingly close parallels exist in Chavin art, as can be seen on the cornice fe- lines of the temple at Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 28). Just a casual glance at any of these animals shows that their paws are kenned into viciously dentated but agnathic monster heads that differ from the Izapan model only to the extent that they spew forth claws. The identical monster- foot device, this time depicted from the front rather than in profile, is present on the bird-man "angels" carved on the flanking columns of the Black-and-White Portal (Figs. 23, 31). Here, as at Izapa, the animal-head feet are attached to human, or at least humanoid, legs. Similarities between certain conventions and motifs in Chavin and Izapan art having been ob- served, it is now appropriate to consider con- gruences which extend beyond isolated config- urations to compositional and/or thematic complexes. A moderately well-documented monument, Kaminaljuyu Stela 9 will initiate discussion. Stela 9 is proto-Izapan in style and was dis- covered in C-III-6, a Las Charcas Phase mound, together with a cache of early Providencia pot- tery which permits a conservatively estimated date of at least 300 B.C. and possibly one as early as 450 B.C. (Miles 1965:248; Proskouriakoff 1968:123, 131; Easby and Scott 1970:100). The work (Fig. 34) has three of its five sides carved with a scene very similar to one executed in Chavin style, on an engraved conch shell found at Chiclayo (Fig. 35). Both compositions show a standing profile figure who seems to blow a shell trumpet while an enigmatic serpentine creature writhes, head turned down, at his feet. 33The Izapan fishing deity or, more accurately, a number of his attributes, could have survived for a very long time in Mesoamerican art. Such traits as his long-snouted bestial face, animal-headed belt, and, above all, kenned feet are present on the god identified as Tiger 3 Turquoise carved into the famous Monte Alban Period IIIA "Bazan Stone" (Caso 1965:856, Fig. 13). A well-known hunchbacked Co- lima figure stands on a two-headed fish (Covarrubias 1957:P1. XXIII right). Both his bulging back and the creature he perches on might possibly be distant, highly diluted and reinterpreted versions of the Izapan fishing god's back- basket and reptilian feet. 16</page><page sequence="17">To be sure, there are some differences between the Peruvian and Mesoamerican versions of this design. In the small Chavin linear rendering, the conch-blower is stocky, and his two arms are awkwardly raised, holding the flask-shaped instrument to his lips. The body of the clearly defined serpentlike head that rests just to the left of his feet is inextricably entwined in a maze of angular loops which rise to engulf the musician in a convoluted pattern of subsidiary agnathic monster faces and snake heads. The monumental Kaminaljuyu figure is more dy- namic and sculptural than that of the Chiclayo shell. It strikes a complex twisted pose with legs turned in the opposite direction of the torso and its forms are attenuated and free-flowing. Un- like the Chavin conch-blower, the Kaminaljuyu personage raises only one hand toward the elab- orate shape glued to his mouth. Whereas this curvilinear detail is identified as a speech scroll by Miles (1965:250), Proskouriakoff entertains the possibility that it may represent a large shell (Proskouriakoff 1968:123). Such an interpreta- tion is entirely consistent with the object's cen- tral spiral and scalloped upper edge, charac- teristics distinctly reminiscent of a sea conch. The monster placed to the right of the Kaminal- juyu figure deviates somewhat from its Chavin analogue, too. It is more fluid and even more convoluted than the latter and it does not engulf the conch-blower in a series of elaborate ken- nings. Significantly, the variations between Ka- minaljuyu Stela 9 and the Chiclayo shell cannot mask, nor do they diminish, the inordinate sim- ilarity of subject matter and basic organization. Both carvings represent identical arbitrary the- matic material arranged in substantially the same way: a standing human conch-blower plays his curious instrument in the company of a writhing serpentine monster whose head rests near the musician's feet. A more dramatically active composition than that of Stela 9 is carved on Stela 19 (Fig. 37), an- other Kaminaljuyu relief, dated at 300-100 B.C. by Easby and Scott (1970:101) and clearly Izapan in style. The scene depicted on this work con- sists of two interacting characters whose rela- tionship implies combat. A running-crouching human figure, wearing a grotesque mask with a pronounced alveolar bar, "wrestles" a serpent whose tail and head terminate in homologous fringed elements. Grasped in both hands of its antagonist, the creature convulses into a number of tight loops or coils which are placed at intervals along its sinuous body. Almost identically the same "wrestling" theme is present on a Cupisnique soapstone tumbler in the Robert Woods Bliss Collection (Fig. 38). As in Stela 9 and the Chiclayo shell, differences in size and composition between the Kaminaljuyu and Chavin specimens now under discussion exist. For instance, the design on the soapstone vessel has two "wrestlers" rather than one. But each is the mirror image of the other placed on an opposite side of the cylindrical container so that in the end only one is visible at a time. Both depict standing humans with grotesque, up- turned profile faces, similar to that of the Ka- minaljuyu figure,- and each grasps in its hands the hoselike body of a creature. Like the serpent in Kaminaljuyu Stela 19, this being terminates in identical tassle-like elements at either end. Furthermore it also coils into precisely the same kind of tight rhythmically spaced loops. Admittedly the Kaminaljuyu snake arches above the "wrestler's" head, who raises both arms to hold it, whereas the serpentine body on the Cupisnique tumbler stretches across its captors' waists. This minor discrepancy is offset by the fact that the reptile is clutched by identi- cally straight-thumbed, stick-fingered hands with out-turned palms in both examples. In sum, the divergences between the Cupisnique tumbler design and the Kaminaljuyu Stela 19 composition are overshadowed by basic yet im- pressively complex parallels in theme and even representation. Surely two so similarly con- ceived artistic creations are art-historically re- lated in some way. If conflict is implicit in the Kaminaljuyu "ser- pent-wrestler" theme, it is completely explicit in Stela 21 (Fig. 39) from Izapa, placed by Miles 17</page><page sequence="18">in Division Four of her Preclassic chronology and recently attributed to a period around 150-1 B.C. (Miles 1965:258; Easby and Scott 1970: 101). The relief on this monument vividly portrays the ultimate result of martial confron- tation. On the right a victorious warrior, wear- ing a monster-head helmet, stands over the prostrate body of his victim. He holds his enemy's severed head aloft by the hair. From the bottom of this grisly prize, as well as from the neck of the corpse below, gush curved bands and scrolls symbolizing blood.34 In the back- ground - witnesses to the drama just enacted - are two small men who carry a palanquin. The vehicle contains a seated figure, and a large jaguar crouches on its roof. The decapitation scene on Izapa Stela 21 is important on a number of counts. First, it initi- ates an iconographic tradition - preserved for many centuries - that finds perhaps its most elaborate expression in the Postclassic ball- court reliefs at Chichen Itza. Second, and spe- cifically relevant to the question of Andean in- fluence, the Stela 21 carving probably shows the earliest unequivocal representation of head- hunting in Mesoamerica (Easby and Scott 1970:94-5). The adoption of this custom is fur- ther attested to in Tres Zapotes Stela A, where, as at Izapa, a decapitated head is carried by the hair (Stirling 1943:13, Fig. 3; Miles 1965:258). Evidence that heads were not merely severed but also treated and preserved as trophies is of- fered on the monument from El Jobo, a site very near Izapa. Here, Stela 1 (which bears a late type of Izapan signature) is embellished with a large figure who holds a trophy head suspended from a strap passed through its mouth or cheeks (Miles 1965:258-9, Fig. 15b). Now, the tardy emergence of a trophy-head- hunting cult in Mesoamerica suggests that it was probably introduced from the South, where it is widely distributed and of demonstrably 34This is similar to the scrolls on the bottom of the basket- shaped net in Izapa Stela 1 which seem to symbolize flowing water. 18 great antiquity (Kidder 1940:447-8; see alsoMe- traux 1949:406-7; Nordenskiold 1931). In Peru the practice of taking and preserving heads was common in the earliest archaeological phases. An excellent example of a trophy head has been found at the Initial Period site (before 1800 B.C.) of Asia on the South Central Coast (Lanning 1967:77). Decapitated humans as well as trophy heads are depicted in the reliefs at Cerro Sechln (Bushnell 1965 :P1. 142); and the subject remains a favorite motif virtually throughout the his- tory of Andean art, enjoying particular favor in Paracas textiles and Nazca pots but frequently employed in other styles, too (Moche, lea, Tia- huanaco, Chimu, etc.). Therefore, it is not sur- prising to find the motif of a victorious warrior carrying a severed head at Chavin (Rowe 1962:Fig. 17). What is remarkable, and reveal- ing, is that one such portrayal bears a striking resemblance to the earliest known head-bran- dishing warrior in Mesoamerica - the trium- phant figure of Izapa Stela 21. Sculpture 53 from Chavin de Huantar (Fig. 40), a square stone slab discovered by Julio Tello in 1934 (Tello 1960:246), is carved with the low- relief image of a standing, fang-mouthed hu- manoid who holds a trophy head in one hand. Comparison with the warrior of Stela 21 dis- closes that both figures are rendered in profile with the right arm flexed at the elbow so that it extends out in front of the body. In each, the hand of this arm grasps a fistful of hair that pro- trudes partially above the thumb and from which a severed head dangles. In the Izapan, as in the Chavin, image, conventionalized strap- like ribbons of blood pour out of the bottom of the trophy which is rendered in profile facing away from its captor. The Chavin head-holder has a fan-shaped form attached to his left shoulder that extends down to the waist. It is constructed of a series of flaring parallel bands, the nethermost two of which apparently depict the flapping ends of a sash. Even these elements are duplicated in the Izapan warrior who wears a fluttering parallel sectioned cape and a tail- like belt-end that issue from his back and rump.</page><page sequence="19">Despite the details, motifs, themes, and com- positions that unite Preclassic Pacific Slope Chiapas-Guatemalan sculpture to that of the Chavin Horizon, important differences be- tween the two obviously exist. This can even be pointed out in so closely congruent a com- plex as the triumphant head-trophy-holder just recorded. In contrast to the dynamically strid- ing figure of Izapa Stela 21, the Chavin warrior stands rigid and immobile, his body composed of stocky, inert, conventionalized forms. And here the elaborate scene that surrounds the Izapan headhunter - the sprawling victim and the palanquin carried in the background - is ab- sent. By and large, with the notable exception of such small works as the Chiclayo shell and the Cupisnique soapstone tumbler, Chavin art is static, formal, and devoid of interacting fig- ures. Exactly the opposite is true of many of the reliefs at Izapa and, to a lesser degree, those from Kaminaljuyu (Miles 1965:252). Especially at Izapa, stelae compositions approach a lively semi-narrative formula in which several par- ticipants relate to each other on the same picto- rial plane. For example, the most complex com- position at Izapa, that on Stela 5 (Fig. 47), ac- cording to Miles a Preclassic Division Four work, includes in its cast of characters two seated groups of men in animated conversation. Behind each of the larger more important fig- ures is an attendant, one of whom holds a para- sol over the dignitary in front of him (Miles 1965:258-9). Basically the same motif is also present at the bottom of Izapa Stela 12 (Fig. 49; Stirling 1943:67-8). The qualities of hieratic or- ganization, figural interaction, narrative con- tent and dynamic movement in these composi- tions are not found in Chavin art. It is therefore impossible to ignore the fact that in this respect they are more spiritually akin to the lively scenes depicted on the ceramics of Chavin's most famous North Coastal successor - the Moche culture of the Chicama and Moche Val- leys. Not only general qualities but also specific themes in Moche and Izapan art can be com- pared. Parallels to the consulting, gesticulating, seated figures of differing rank just described in Stela 5 (Fig. 47) are found in many Moche narra- tives (Fig. 48) where the superior conversant also often has an attendant placed behind him as at Izapa. Mythical characters represented on Izapan stelae occur on Moche vessels.35 Winged bird-men (Fig. 25), similar in overall concept rather than appearance or specific attributes to the "diver" of Stela 2 (Fig. 22), abound. The rump-masked, pot-bellied feline of Izapa Stela 6 (Fig. 29) has lean jaguar Moche cousins whose sinuous tails, but not rumps, end in long-ton- gued cat heads (Fig. 33). Even specific elements of Izapa Stela 21 (Fig. 39) can be found in Moche art. The striding warrior with animal-head hel- met holding a severed head, his sprawling foe, and the personage carried in a litter have ana- logues in a variety of Moche compositions as does the trophy head with a rope passed through its mouth in El Jobo Stela 1 (Figs. 41, 42, 43; Miles 1965:Fig. 15b). Men in boats, and combat between a deity-like warrior and fantastic rep- tilian or fish-like creatures, are favorite Moche themes (Fig. 45; Kutscher 1950:Fig. 17). Both these subjects are present on Izapa Stela 3 (Fig. 44), a previously unmentioned work, where the raised club-bearing arm of the humanoid com- batant and the disposition of his bestial oppo- nent offer an impressive parallel to the Moche version of this drama. The victorious protago- nist in the supernatural Moche battles is usually a god with a serpent-headed belt (Kutscher 1950:65) reminiscent of the type worn by the deity in Izapa Stela 1 (Fig. 30). Sometimes the Moche deity is engaged in fish- ing, like the Izapan god, though his prey is a monstrous fish-demon, not ensnared in a net, but caught at the end of a hooked line (Kutscher 1950:Fig. 58; 1954:P1. 61C). A second detail of Izapa Stela 1, the act of carrying a pack strapped 35For interpretations of Moche iconography see Larco Hoyle 1939,- Kutscher 1950; 1954; 1967; Tello 1923b. 19</page><page sequence="20">to the back, is also known in Moche painting, however, in a genre context (Fig. 32). In addi- tion, the horizontal double-headed serpent who supports the figure of Stela 1 and the arched double-headed monsters that enframe Izapa Stela 11 (Miles 1965:252, Fig. 12d) and 12 (Fig. 49) possess numerous Moche parallels (Fig. 14) that function in an analogous fashion. Doubt- less additional shared Moche-Izapa conven- tions could be discovered, but, as the function of these comparisons is a restricted one within the context of this paper, only three more themes will be pursued. They are the musician who plays in the presence of beasts, the net-cap- tured animal, and the animated skeleton. The conch-blower performing before a mythi- cal monster has been described in the Chavin style Chiclayo shell (Fig. 35) and Kaminaljuyu Stela 9 (Fig. 34). A Moche craftsman employed substantially the same composition on a so- called "mountain-sacrifice" vessel (Fig. 36). The pot is modeled to show a multi-peaked mountain. Its apex is covered by a sacrificial victim lying face down with his hair flowing over the side of the forward slope. To the right, on a somewhat lower hillock, sits a helmeted personage playing a shell trumpet. At the musi- cian's feet crouch at least two beasts. One of them can be identified as a large reptile by its serrated tail and is therefore clearly analogous to the serpentine monsters incorporated into the Chiclayo shell and Kaminaljuyu conch- blower scenes. Izapa Stela 12 (Fig. 49), according to Miles a Division Four monument (Miles 1965:258), has been referred to in passing solely with regard to the U-shaped, double-headed monster that en- closes the design and the seated figures placed at its bottom. Other aspects of this composition are equally noteworthy. From above the ser- pent's two heads depend ropes from which hangs the limp carcass of a jaguar. While the carving's surface is badly defaced, it is still pos- sible to discern that the feline's body is cradled in a roughly woven or plaited object. Stirling proposes that this might represent a mat- 20 covered altar (Stirling 1943:67-8). A different in- terpretation is suggested by comparison with some Moche hunting scenes. A number of these show the running prey being driven into a net (Fig. 50; Kutscher 1954:16-17). The Izapan ja- guar is obviously already caught, and the hunter depicted on Moche vessels is absent, but the coarsely plaited object beneath the animal might well be the device that was used to en- snare it. If this is so, then the net-hunted-animal theme occurs in Izapan as well as Moche art. The last Izapa-Moche parallel to be men- tioned is the animated corpse. Stela 50 from Izapa (Fig. 5 1 ), a monument not previously con- sidered here, has as its main character a male figure whose seated pose (repeated in Izapa Stela 10)36 is similar to that of the reclining man of Petroglyph 2 at Chalcatzingo (Cook de Leonard 1967:Fig. 1). Like the Chalcatzingo personage, the Stela 50 male is ithyphallic, but with this the similarity between the two images ends; for whereas the former is well fleshed, even chubby, the Izapan figure is actually an ani- mated skeleton whose long, scroll-ended phallus protrudes from a hollow bony groin. Bony, cadaverous personages, at times engaged in a sort of "dance of death" (Kutscher 1950:33), are depicted on various Moche vessels (Kutscher 1950:Fig. 34; 1954:Pls. 30-2). What is most striking is that a number of Moche ca- davers are emphatically ithyphallic (Fig. 52), and at least one of these (Fig. 53) is seated in much the same pose assumed by the Izapan skeleton. In terms of the major thesis of this paper, the significant question raised by Izapa-Moche par- allels is whether some of the motifs that have been ascribed to Chavin influence could really have been transmitted to Izapa as residual ele- ments preserved in Moche models. A precise chronology expressed in absolute dates for all three artistic traditions might help to resolve 36Miles places Stela 10 in either Division Two or Three of the Preclassic (Miles 1965:251-2, Fig. 12c).</page><page sequence="21">this problem. As yet none exists, but a general assessment of the relative position occupied by Izapa vis-a-vis Chavin and Moche art is in order. For the moment the best guess is that the Izapan monuments here discussed were produced sometime between ca. 400/300 B.C. and A.D. 200, with the likelihood that the greatest activ- ity took place in the centuries just preceding and following the time of Christ. The dates of Chavin style, as published within the last dec- ade, have been variously estimated as: circa 700-200 B.C. (Rowe 1962:5) circa 800-200 B.C. (Ford 1969:189) circa 900-200 B.C. (Lanning 1967:25, 96) circa 1000-100 B.C. (Bennett and Bird 1960:82) circa 1200-300 B.C. (Rowe 1967:73) circa 1200-500/400 B.C. (Sawyer 1968:18-19, 24)37 Those for Moche culture* vary from: circa A.D.300-800 (Rowe 1962:21) circa A.D. 1-580 (Rowe 1967:87) circa A.D. 1-800 (Larco Hoyle 1966:Table I) circa 150 B.C. -A.D. 900 (Bennett and Bird 1960:82) circa 200 B.C. -A.D. 600 (Lanning 1967:26-7, 123) circa 200 B.C. -A.D. 700 (Sawyer 1968:40) circa 400 B.C. -A.D. 700 (Kubler 1962:247) Overall this much is clear: even the earliest ter- minal date for Chavin (400 B.C.) and one of the later initiatory dates of Moche (A.D.I) places each tradition within striking distance of Izapa. Accepting some of the later dates for the end of Chavin and earlier ones for the beginning of Moche presents the possibility that both, or in- termediary versions of both, were partly coeval with Izapa and indeed with one another.38 Broadly speaking, however, it appears that the 37By and large, the accordance of greater antiquity to Chavin seems to be the result of more recent scholarship. 38Larco Hoyle is of the opinion that the sculpture of Chavin de Huantar is contemporaneous with Moche period III (Larco Hoyle 1966: 139]. Izapan style was sandwiched between them in time, perhaps overlapping with the later phases of Chavin at the start and then coexisting for a period with Moche. To reiterate, does that mean that the motifs here ascribed to Chavin intrusion could really have been transmitted to Izapa in the form of Moche translations? One suspects that in most instances Moche works are too recent to have functioned in this capac- ity; for while they might conceivably be con- temporaneous with, they are unlikely to be older than their Izapan analogues. Of course, concurrence does not exclude the possibility of influence. For this reason and because too much latitude persists in both Moche and Izapan dat- ing systems to correlate them accurately, the problem of whether Izapa received Chavin ele- ments via Moche models cannot be answered exclusively on the basis of chronological data. Further evaluation must take iconographic and especially stylistic evidence into account.39 It is possible to isolate Chavinoid compo- nents in Izapan sculpture which are either in- consequential or absent in Moche art and there- fore would not have been derived from it. Prom- inent among them is an emphasis on relatively heavy, rounded-off blocky shapes that are cov- 39Moche pottery has been divided into five periods (Larco Hoyle 1948:28-36), and linear narrative painting is said not to precede the ceramics of Period II or III, while mountain- sacrifice vessels such as the one illustrated in Fig. 36 have been associated with Periods III and IV (Larco Hoyle 1948:30-5; Kubler 1962:258-9; Sawyer 1966:26-8). Sawyer assigns Moche Periods II-IV to a time span from 50 B.C. to A.D. 500 (Sawyer 1968:40-4), in which event they would probably be too late to have affected any but a few Izapan works. Another estimate holds that Moche II began ca. 150 B.C. (Kubler 1962:xxxv); a greater impact on Izapa might then be contemplated. A further rub lies in the imprecision that surrounds the dating of the Izapan style itself. Accord- ing to Miles's system, Izapa Stela 2 (Fig. 22) could have been produced any time between 300 B.C. and A.D.300, that is to say, either before or after the rise of Moche linear narra- tive style. Uncertainty is compounded by the fact that mon- uments with distinct Chavin parallels such as Izapa Stela 21 (Fig. 39) and Kaminaljuyu Stelae 10 (Fig. 4) and 19 (Fig. 37) may date after 150 B.C., within possible range of the Moche narrative mode - if indeed Moche II ceramics com- menced ca. 150 B.C. 21</page><page sequence="22">ered with profuse surface decoration comprised of elaborate scrollwork and scrolled protrusions rendered as straplike forms. Sometimes mul- tiple outlines like the ones on the undulating dragon of Tres Zapotes Stela D (Fig. 15) are em- ployed. Particularly complex straplike forms occur on Kaminaljuyu Stela 19 (Fig. 37) and especially on Izapa Stelae 11 and 2 (Fig. 22). In addition to their encrusted surfaces, the latter two monuments have a partially frozen, almost iconic quality - and this in spite of the action depicted in them: a bird -man diving into a tree in one case and into a creature squatting on a double-headed serpent in the other. But the diver's rigid wings are, it seems, fully extended, not so much in flight as in heraldic display; and the compositions of the stelae are closed, basi- cally frontal, formal, and bilaterally symmet- rical. All of these attributes, from ornate surface decoration to static design, could have been inspired by late Chavin art but not by the mer- curial linear style or dynamically moving fig- ures of the Moche draftsman. Some iconographic and/or motif elements present in Chavm and Izapa but not, to my knowledge, used in Moche design can also be enumerated. These include the agnathic heads found on many Chavin reliefs and in a variety of Izapan dragon masks (Miles 1 965 : Fig. 2b,d,e,f; Fig. 3e and h) as well as the Chiapa de Corzo saurian (Fig. 7). The same observation holds true for the central tooth and distended alveolus. The monster head with flowering tree so conspicuously represented in Izapa Stelae 2 (Fig. 22) and 5 (Fig. 47) and present in the Tello Obelisk (Fig. 21) is also not part of the Moche idiom. Nor, with a few exceptions - such as the terminal heads on some creatures7 tails - is ken- ning (Fig. 33). Clearly the rump-mask on the ja- guar of Stela 6 (Fig. 29) cannot be traced to Moche models of this sort any more than can the kenned agnathic monster-mask feet of the fishing deity in Izapa Stela 1 (Fig. 30). Both of these devices are absent in Moche art but con- spicuous in that of Chavin. While the list of Izapa-Chavm sans Moche analogues might be 22 expanded to encompass more examples, a basic point has been sufficiently illustrated: Izapan art contains a strong Chavinoid strain which is independent of Izapa-Moche similarities and therefore art-historically distinct from them. The parallels between Moche and Izapa pose another problem, much of it beyond the re- stricted scope of the present study. Never- theless, some impressions about their art-his- torical significance and potential for further re- search are permissible. To be sure, a number of shared Moche-Izapan traits - double-headed serpents, bird-men, the musician performing before beasts and the trophy-head-bearing war- rior - are probably collateral relatives of Chavin ancestry. Yet others cannot be explained in these terms. Dignitaries in palanquins, men in boats, "conversing figures/' club-wielding dei- ties combatting supernatural monsters, net- hunted animals, ithyphallic skeletons, and, above all, realistic narrative scenes replete with action, interaction and vivid movement do not occur in the art of Chavin. If Chavin cannot be used to account for this constellation of Izapa- Moche similarities, some other explanation will have to be found. This can probably not be done by restricting investigation exclusively to Izapa and Moche as the system of relationships that they participate in may be indirect and complex. In other words, while Moche-Izapa parallels have been introduced here primarily as a foil against which to test the validity of the Chavin-Izapa hypothesis, it is also evident that they may open further avenues for investigation in Mesoamerican and Andean linkages. These investigations will have to cast a wide net to in- clude other possibly relevant traditions; for in- stance, the ceramic complexes of Western Mex- ico which are roughly coeval with, and bear close affinity to, those of the Moche culture (Kubler 1962:256; Easby and Scott 1970:119- 20). Dangerous as it is to prognosticate in mat- ters such as this, one may venture to say that whatever the direction and scope that future study of Izapa-Moche relationships may take, it will have to consider implications inherent in</page><page sequence="23">the position that each of these traditions occupies in the developmental sequence of art in its area. Compositions portraying several relief fig- ures in vivid action and interaction appear quite early in Mexico. They are already present on Olmec monuments, such as Altar 5 and Stela 3 from La Venta whose struggling infants (Fig. 46) and flying warriors verge on the narrative and perhaps anticipate themes of combat be- tween paired antagonists. Clearly the Izapan proclivity for representing figures in dynamic interrelated movement has ancient domestic roots. Moreover, this tendency does not weaken with time but is sustained and elaborated by succeeding Mesoamerican cultures. In contrast, the realistic Moche graphic style is an anomaly within the Andean cultural sphere. Throughout three millennia of artistic development in this area, the Moche, and only the Moche, depicted complex graphic narrative scenes showing nu- merous figures in vigorous action. Emerging in their work unheralded by any local antecedents, this representational idiom disappears without progeny together with the eclipse of Moche civ- ilization. Subsequent Peruvian arts revert to a formula stressing essentially static and isolated images.40 All this implies that action-filled, non-Chavinoid Moche parallels with Izapamay exist within the framework of a southward movement of Mesoamerican influence. Whether some of that influence stemmed im- mediately from the Izapan style to affect Moche art directly is a fascinating possibility but, at present, a moot point. Nor is it clear whether the non-Chavinoid motifs shared by Izapa and Moche traveled in only one direction,- after all, they could reflect various degrees of Andean and Mesoamerican reciprocity. Our current data are simply too vague to award clearcut pri- ority to one or another area in all cases.41 The relationship between Chavin and Izapa, the primary subject of this study, is less ambigu- ous. There can be little question about Chavin's chronological precedence. And though it would be desirable to close the time gap that may theo- retically separate the two styles and certain of the monuments that have been compared, any serious doubt of connection between Chavin and Izapan art should be dispelled by the strength of the visual and iconographic similari- ties that they have been shown to share. These may be summarized as follows: 1. The fanged, grinning, strap-lipped mouth. 2. The fanged, U-shaped monster-snout depicted from above. 3. The mouth with a central fang. 4. The double-headed serpent-monster. 5. The multiple-outlined, undulating or me- ander-shaped dragon-serpent with retrousse tail. 6. The entwined or "knotted" serpent. 7. The flowering monster head. 8. The grotesque masked bird-man with heraldically extended wings. 9. The grotesque profile bird with drooping tail and single raised wing. 10. The jaguar with kenned rump mask. 11. Kenned agnathic monster-head feet. 12. The conch-blower performing before a writhing serpentine creature placed at his feet. 13. The grotesque wrestler in combat with a rhythmically coiled serpent-dragon. 14. The victorious warrior holding a blood- gushing trophy head in his extended hand. Finally it may be reiterated that, like Chavin sculpture, Izapan sculpture often has a surface 40The roots of Moche art have been sought variously in Recuay, Gallinazo, Salinar, and Vicus. None of these, how- ever realistic some of their images may be, display signs of two-dimensional graphic narrative such as encountered in the Moche scenes discussed here (see Sawyer 1968:25; 1966:22; Kubler 1962:249; Larco Hoyle 1944; 1965b). 41For example, if Izapa Stela 50 is a Preclassic Division Three monument (Miles 1965:251-2] to be dated around 300B.C.-A.D.200, then the ithyphallic skeleton on it may be almost exactly contemporaneous with Moche versions of the same motif, to say nothing of the Protoclassic phallic images of Western Mexico. 23</page><page sequence="24">profusely covered with elaborate, scrolled, straplike forms executed in low relief. The quality of the parallels recapitulated above as evidence of contact does not rest solely on their complexity,- it is augmented by the na- ture of their occurrence. Considering the arbi- trary selection imposed by the chances of sur- vival and the few examples that have come down to us, one cannot but be impressed by the high ratio of congruences found in Chavin and Izapan-style works. This frequent incidence of similarity among a small group of monuments suggests fairly intense influence and therefore supports the belief that the Pacific Coast of Guatemala and Chiapas was once a focus of Andean artistic contact in Preclassic Meso- america. 24</page><page sequence="25">Illustrations</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 3 a.
