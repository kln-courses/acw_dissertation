Introduction Like Diogenes of Oenoanda, Demetrius of Laconia, better known as Demetrio Lacone, is a philosopher for whom the world is not yet prepared.1 He comes not from Lycia but from Laconia, once a very unphilosophical part of he world. He qualifies for inclusion in this survey for only the last twenty-five years of his life, since the dates usually assigned to him are c. 150-75 BC. Unlike Diogenes of Oenoanda, who remained anonymous until 1889, he is known to us from Strabo, Sextus Empiricus, Diogenes Laertius, and most importantly Philodemus in his Methods of Inference ,2 but his writings survive only in the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum. He was a contemporary and associate of Philodemus' teacher, Zeno of Sidon (c. 150-75 BC), who was head of the Epicurean School in Athens. Cicero heard him lecture in there in 79-78. It is likely that we owe the papyrus copies of Demetrius' writings in the Library in Herculaneum to the interest in Demetrius that Philodemus shared with Zeno. Demetrius might have collected the nucleus of what was to become Philodemus' library in the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum.3 We know from Strabo that Demetrius, who he identifies as ó Aókcov, was a pupil of Protarchus of Bargilia; his writings attest his close association with Zeno and two Roman associates, Nero and Quintus.4 Unlike Diogenes who wrote on stone, Demetrius of Laconia figures not as a supplement (or a supplement to a supplement) of the Neapolitan series La Scuola 1 There is a brief survey of his writings by Tiziano Dorandi in Richard Goulet, 'Demetrios 60', in Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques 2, ed. Richard Goulet (Paris 1994) 637-41. There is a longer census of his work and the papyri that can be plausibly attributed to him since De Falco's collection (V. De Falco, L'Epicureo Demetrio Lacone [Naples 1923; Garland reprint, 1987]) in C. Romeo and E.

As a philosopher, Demetrius had many interests, but he is distinguished as an Epicurean by his philological and philosophical interest in the text of Epicurus and in his exposition of the difficult and, I think, insurmountable of problem for any Epicurean of expounding and then justifying Epicurus' theology. If he is the author of PHerc. 1013, he had another difficult and apostolic mission - that of defending Epicurus' paradoxical view that the sun is the size that it appears to be.5 It is clear that he had many other interests than defending Epicurus' meteorological paradox. He was engaged in polemical pam- phleteering with contemporary Stoics, Peripatetics, and Epicureans, and, perhaps, with the greatest and most comprehensive Stoic thinker of his age, Posidonius of Apamea. The range of Demetrius' writings might seem surprising for an Epicurean. He wrote a work on geometry that included an attack on some theorems in the first book of Euclid's Elements that he found to be in conflict with the Epicurean theory of the least parts ( minimae partes/eká%'Gia ļispiļ). This theory gives atoms extension and mass but maintains that atoms can only be broken down by geometrical analysis, although it grants, as it must, that by this analysis there must be minimae partes in any given atom. Demetrius treated at great length (in five books, PHerc. 1429) the problematic aspects of Polyaenus' criticisms of Euclid in the first generation of the Epicurean school in Athens. A much less polemical interest in the Elements of Euclid seems to have been shared by Epicurus, who was deeply impressed by Euclid's axoixeíoaiç or systematic presentation of geometry beginning with its most elemental propositions.6 Anticipating the interests of Philodemus of Gadara, a Greek Epicurean active in Italy in the next generation, Demetrius wrote on both rhetoric and poetry, and (in PHerc. 1012) he shows an impressive philological command of the text of Epicurus. Most importantly, he wrote an extremely difficult treatise on how humans gain knowledge of the anthropomorphic gods of Epicurean theology {PHerc. 1055). All of his writings are difficult, in part because of his technical vocabulary, or Epicurean 'jargon', in part because they survive only in fragmentary papyri. 2. Demetrius the apologist: on the shape of god I begin with this treatise, with the reluctance and temptation every scholar feels when he or she approaches the text of Cicero's On the nature of the gods , 1.49. PHerc. 1055 has no subscription, but its final column (XXV) brings us close to its conclusion. It is clear from the very partial text of the beginning that the astral divinities of Plato, the Peripatetics, and 5 Published by Costantina Romeo, 'Demetrio Lacone sulla grandezza del sole (PHerc. 1013)' CErc 9 (1979) 1 1-33.

(For this I must rely on the report of Dorandi, 'Demetrios', n. 1 above) 6 I argue this in 'Epicurus' Last will and testament,' AGPh 55 (1973) 252-80 (reprinted as Chapter 1 in my Paradosis and survival : three chapters in the history of Epicurean philosophy (Ann Arbor, Michigan 1998).</page><page sequence="3">DISKIN CLAY: DEMETRIUS OF LACONI A 209 the Stoics are caught in Demetrius' sight. His task is to demonstrate just how humans arrive at a conception, not of perceptible gods (Plato's astral divinities or earth bound statues of the gods), but of the Epicurean gods who are the product of human reasoning (kô yco 0EG)pr|Tá as opposed to aiaOíixá). The fundamental problem facing any Epicurean compelled to defend Epicurus' conception of the gods is that these gods must be com- pounds and it is axiomatic in Epicurean physics that all compounds are destructible. Yet, Epicurus insisted that his divinity was, as he put it, 'a living being that is blessed and indestructible' (Çcoov jiaicápiov Kal aq&gt;0apxov, as formulated in Epicurus' Kyria doxa I). Demetrius' procedure bears a strong resemblance to Epicurus' procedure in asserting human spontaneity and freedom in On nature 34.7 He offers a developmental account of human knowledge and of how memory and the ability to associate things of similar kinds leads to understanding and a mature conception of the gods as human in form and rational beings. The best illustration of this procedure can be seen in cols. XIV.1-XV.6: 8ià xoûxo 8' ó|a[o]ÍG)v è'xei KaTá&gt;tT1'|/iv.

For this reason [a human's developing memory ] a person has a conception of things that are similar. And, when these similar things have been carefully reviewed one after another, it is not difficult to explain in addition precisely by what natural reflexes [his term is ¿7UG7taaļxoi, or how we are drawn] to accept the divine as anthropomorphic. For clearly we attach the human form to god. And, since we do not discover the faculty of reason in another form [or species] apart from the human, it is clear that we must accept that the divine too has a human form so that it possesses along with the faculty of reason a real existence. Demetrius recognizes that this argument stirs up a hive of hostile objections. If the divine has a human form, it must have hands and feet and eyes, and, if eyes, be subject to ophthalmia. Demetrius dismisses such cavils as rubbish (Aiļpov, XVIII.8) and claims that the divine (xò 0eîov) is Supuèç (XXII.9). There is not much comment on this phrase in Santoro's fine edition, but Jeffrey Purinton has made an attempt to interpret it in the context of passages from Epicurus, Philodemus, and Cicero.8 I think with Purinton that Demetrius might be using the term in a technical sense: that is, for Demetrius the divine is made up of a material constitution distinct from the human and perceptible, or perhaps a union of two forms of perception - the external flow of images to human beings and their internal reception and reconstitution. (This text would seem providentially to justify the interpretation in Long and Sedley that the Epicurean gods are the products of our own 7 20 in A. A. Long and D. N. Sedley, The Hellenistic philosophers (Cambridge 1987). J. Purinton, 'Epicurus on the Nature of the Gods,' OSAP 21 (2001) 181-231.</page><page sequence="4">210 GREEK AND ROMAN PHILOSOPHY 100 BC-200 AD - VOLUME I minds.)9 The treatise is addressed to a Roman by the name of Quintus and concludes with a rhetorical description of the Epicurean gods as 'forms that both stand apart in their loftiness and in their dispositions that hold anything base in contempt, all of them revolving about its [sic] own blessedness and imperishability' (XXV.9-14). 3. Demetrius the philologist Demetrius shows an interest unparalleled in antiquity in the text of Epicurus' writings, as is demonstrated by the treatise without a title or subscription surviving in PHerc . 1012. An approximate title would be 'Problems in the Text of Epicurus.' We have now entered the portal of the age in which, in the words of Seneca, philosophy has become philology {quae philosophia fuit, facta philologia est , Letter 108.23). The extraordinary thing about Demetrius' approach to the text and meaning of Epicurus is the fact that he finds just- ification for the construction of some of the most arid and difficult prose ever written in Greek in the practice of poets. His range of critical reading is evident in this treatise and the two books he devoted to poetry in which he refers to Aeschylus' Edones and cites Euripides' Licymnius , Alcaeus, Sappho, and Sophron, as well as other now anonymous poets, and offers explanations of foreign or unusual words such as risppaļiov payáiav (Greek Phrygian for 'King Priam') or ncoXu and TT1yavtaxóv to explain Sophron's words describing the 'half-baked' barbarian, Koikoa.10 Unfortunately the lemmata he produces in his study of the text of Epicurus are most often missing and we have only his defence against the carping and tasteless criticisms directed against the master. He defends an aitò koivoû construction in Epicurus by appeal to an epigram of Kallimachos (VII.3-4 Pfeiffer) and a citation from Empedokles (DK 3 1 B 142). To defend some ambiguity (an&lt;pißoAia) of reference in a relative clause he cites a famous case of such ambiguity from the Homeric Catalogue of ships (XXXI, citing Iliad 2.871-872). Aeschylus (XXII Semeie fr. 317a Radt) and Euripides ( Orestes 1381-1385) come to his aid to justify some fault of grammar brought against Epicurus. How niggling and needling Epicurus' philological critics were emerges from the criticism that, in discussing the fear of death and the fate of the body in death, Epicurus uses the words for larvae (evXaî) and worms (oKcoXrjKsç) as if they were synonymous (XXXV). And speaking of worms - or moths - Demetrius knows a defective text of Epicurus' pronouncement that the real philosopher will not fret about his burial (XLI; si oo&lt;pòç àvf|p Toupfjç (ppovTieî, DL 10.118) that replaces the thought of burial by the thought of food (ipoípfiç). He is, of course, right that this text is defective. What happened is that a moth destroyed the alpha and an ignorant (and perhaps hungry) scribe supplied rho omicron giving the object of the philosopher's concern as for food rather than for his burial. 9 The Hellenistic philosophers (n. 7, above) 23. Long and Sedley do not cite this text of Demetrius. A remote parallel for this understanding of how humans create an mental image of the gods comes from Plato, Phaedrus 252D. 10 The 'Problems in the text of Epicurus' are edited by Puglia, 'Aporie testuali' (n.2, above). Demetrius' two volumes On poetry are edited by Romeo, Demetrio. La Poesia (n. 1 , above). The passages I call attention to come from book 2 (cols. XXXI and LVI-LVI).</page><page sequence="5">DISKIN CLAY: DEMETRIUS OF LACONIA 21 1 Demetrius is very conscious of the problems in the textual transmission of Epicurus' philosophical patrimony (rcapáSoaiç). We know that he was active in Miletos and we suppose he must have been active in Athens, where Epicurus' writings were preserved in the Garden and, if I am right, in the Metröon or Public Records of Athens as well.11 Demetrius' concern for the accuracy of the texts of Epicurus that were circulating in his age demonstrates a commitment to the word of the master that would take his contemporaries back nearly two hundred years to the originals of the manuscripts then in circulation. His criticism of even contemporary Epicurean philology is an impressive example not so much of Epicurean philology itself as of the Epicurean aspiration to return to the master.
