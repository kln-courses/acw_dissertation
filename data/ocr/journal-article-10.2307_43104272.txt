From the 1950s through the 1990s , the trope of performance was elaborated across a range of academic disciplines , providing a platform for comparing the construction of identities through mimetic embodiment in ritual, work , and everyday life. Today , as animation is being remediated through digital media , both scholars and participants in various types of online communities are beginning to use animation as a trope for human action on/in the world. This essay attempts to bring together the insights of recent scholarship in various disciplines in order to outline a general animation model, first presenting some of the characteristics of animation that allow it to draw connections between social, technological, and psychic structures, and then examining some of the ways that the models of animation and perfor- mance interact in contemporary subcultural practices, [animation, performance, reme- diation, media ideologies, techno-cultures] Those by calls all the of kinds us "Moebius who of animated live Strip anywhere of characters.

They dance across our cinema and com- puter screens and sit on our desks to keep us company at work; they beckon us into shopping malls, museums, and airports; they show up on our credit cards and dangle from our cell phones and book bags; they run, on their wooden, plastic, or furry little feet, across the Broadway stage and through the pages of novels and academic essays. Over the past 20 or so years, without much fanfare, animation has become a ubiqui- tous part of daily life in the postindustrial world. This proliferation of animation has been facilitated by several factors, notably the development of digital technologies; the rise of the so-called content industries or creative industries in North America, Europe, and Asia; and the increasing interna- tional flow of commodities and workers. Much of the animation that surrounds us is created directly through digital technology - for example, the computer-generated characters that populate PC and online games of all sorts, and Pixar Studio's annual blockbuster features. Digital transfer has also allowed for older, analog forms of animation, for instance Miyazaki Hayao's hand-drawn eel animation and Aardman Studio's claymation features, to reach a global audience on DVD. Industrial structures and marketing strategies that bind video animation with comics and graphic novels, figurines, and other tie-in products have emerged from the dialogue between Ameri- can and Japanese entertainment industries and spread throughout the postindustrial world (Allison 2006; Jenkins 2005; Kelts 2006). The proliferation of animation and animated characters is not simply an effect or symptom of the intersection of computer technology and structural transformations in global capitalism. Animation is also popular because it provides a productive trope for thinking through this intersection. In this essay, I argue that animation has the same potential as a structuring trope in the age of digital media and the rise of the creative industries that performance had in the age of broadcast media and the rise of the service industry.

Scholars can, and still do, use the concept of performance to analyze animation. The consumption of manga and anime, particularly the reconstruction of animated characters in cosplay (i.e., "Costume Play"), is often read as performance of subcultural identities. Animators themselves claim to be "just very shy actors."1 But there are ways in which the concept of performance seems to fall short when we are talking about animated characters. As Hastings and Manning (2004) have pointed out, the concept of performance has become so tied to the expression of self-identity that it has tended to deflect scholarly attention from the fact that many speech acts are, in fact, "acts of alterity." Within performance studies, the equally strong binding of the concept of performance to the idea of embodied mimesis has also tended to obscure animation as a kind of action worthy of study in its own right. The concept of performance, in other words, tends to hide the ontological difference between ani- mated characters and the people who create, use, and interact with them. We lose sight of the uncanny "illusion of life" that makes these characters appealing, of their particular blend of materiality and imagination, and of their diffuse agency.2 These reflections come out of my own research experience. My dissertation project was squarely within the anthropology of performance - in the 1990s, I did fieldwork on the practice of cross-gender performance in Taiwanese folk opera, and on how this practice influenced the way that actresses and their fans, as well as Taiwanese society more broadly, performed and thought about "off-stage" gender roles. But when I started doing fieldwork with the producers and fans of a popular video puppetry series in 2002, 1 kept running into places where the concept of performance just didn't help. For instance, I found that standard questions which had elicited detailed stories and explanations from opera actresses and their fans - questions like, "How do you get into character?" - made no sense at all to fans who were cosplaying puppet characters. In Perform or Else: From Discipline to Performance , Jon McKenzie argues that "per- formance is the stratum of power /knowledge that emerged in the US in the late twentieth century . . . performance will be to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries what discipline was to the eighteenth and nineteenth" (2001:18). While I think that McKenzie's Foucauldian, historical analysis of the power effects of performance discourse is right on target, I also think that the ubiquity of animation in the 21st century (so far) should make us suspicious of his projection of these power effects into the future. I would suggest that we are already seeing the emergence of anima- tion as an alternative model of and for human action in the world, one that, like performance and discipline, is compelling in every sense of the word. Here I want to draw together some concepts that are being articulated within a broad range of disciplines and discourses, and propose animation as a trope that, like performance, might help us to draw new connections between psychology and sociology, art and economics, technology and culture. I do not propose that animation should replace performance any more than performance replaced discipline. Rather, like discipline and performance, performance and animation intersect and complement each other. Each may be seen as simply a version of the other, but separating them as heuristic tools allows us to focus on aspects of the postindustrial condition that might other- wise escape notice. In the first section of this essay, I want to historically contextualize performance as a theoretical concept and outline the connections it draws between different spheres of power/ knowledge. In the second section, I want to clarify the differences between animation and performance and suggest some of the ways that animation might draw new lines between different dimensions of human life, in the 21st century. I conclude with some examples of how anthropology can contribute to the elaboration of ani- mation as a productive trope by looking at how performance and animation are intertwined in specific cultural practices.</page><page sequence="3">424 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology The Performance Paradigm Histories of performance studies see the discipline gradually emerging in the 1950s to 1970s, when scholars in the social sciences, philosophy, and theater studies began to use the tropes of performance, drama, and theatricality to describe social inter- action (in anthropology, Erving Goffman, Milton Singer, and Victor Turner were particularly important in elaborating this trope).3 1 believe that one of the conditions which made performance available as a trope for social theory during these decades was the fact that theatrical performance was then in the process of what Bolter and Grusin call "remediation" in North America and Britain. Bolter and Grusin see remediation as "the representation of one medium in another" (1999:45), when a new technology "appropriates the techniques, forms, and social significance of other media and attempts to rival or refashion them in the name of the real" (1999:65). In his seminal work on the flow structure of television programming, first pub- lished in 1974, Raymond Williams (1990:59) noted, almost as an aside, that In most parts of the world, since the spread of television, there has been a scale and intensity of dramatic performance which is without any precedent in the history of human cul- ture . . . [It] seems probable that in societies like Britain and the United States more drama is watched in a week or weekend, by the majority of viewers, than would have been watched in a year or in some cases a lifetime in any previous historical period. What Williams means by drama here is, basically, real people enacting fictional char- acters in fictional narratives. In other words, what Williams was noting was televi- sion's remediation of the theater.4 If television's remediation of theater made drama ubiquitous, its reframing also brought a new reflexivity to theater itself. Television's remediation of theater in a particular "name of the real" - its naturalization of naturalism - provoked many in the avant-garde to relocate the real of the theater in its liveness, in precisely what was lost in the transposition to television. The redefinition of social interaction and ritual as performance that was elaborated by writers such as Goffman and Turner grew out of dialogue between theater studies and anthropology in the age of the soap opera and the sitcom, Grotowski and the San Francisco Mime Troupe. It is not surprising that these theories tended to define performance in terms of aspects of theater that came to the fore in discussions of its difference from television - the use of space, interactive communication, the materiality of the actor's body, the visible gap between actor and role, scriptedness versus improvisation, social reproduction versus social transformation. Performance Studies was institutionalized as a discipline with the establishment of the Performance Studies Program at New York University in 1980. Founder Richard Schechner's definition of performance as "restored behavior" helped to bring all the various disciplinary approaches together, and solidified the association of perfor- mance with embodiment and mimesis. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the performance paradigm developed in new directions under the influence of poststructuralist theory. Judith Butler's Gender Trouble (1990) bound the idea of performance to identity, combining earlier anthro- pological concepts of cultural performance with Lacan's model of the mirror phase to argue that biological humans take on gender identities through repeated acts of (mis)recognition and (always imperfect) mimesis of role models. Butler's model pro- vided a way out of the problem posed by feminists since de Bouvoir - that discur- sively, woman can only be defined by negativity, as not-man - while also avoiding biological essentialism, by arguing that performance is performative in J.L. Austin's sense of the term. In other words, Butler argues that embodied performances of masculinity and femininity do not simply materialize and reproduce preexisting social roles, but, over time, construct the identity categories of man and woman. What Austin would call "infelicitous" gender performances, such as drag, have the</page><page sequence="4">Animation: The New Performance? 425 potential to make visible the ideologies that authorize "felicitous" gender perfor- mances (e.g., biologism) as such.5 McKenzie notes that after Judith Butler, Performance Studies came to be seen as virtually synonymous with Gender/ Queer Studies in the American academy. This is not simply because Butler herself focuses on gender identity, but because there was a high degree of overlap between performance studies academics and activists in the Queer identity political movements in the U.S. and the U.K., and public performance was taken up, with much success, as a major tactic by ActUp, the Lesbian Avengers, and many other activist groups. In the same period, the term performance was also taken up with zeal in the business world, for instance in the now ubiquitous "employee performance evaluations" and shareholder demands for organizational "performance." McKenzie argues that in this discourse, Austin's concept of performativity as efficacy is replaced by the conflation of performance with efficiency. For the promoters of "business performance manage- ment," the concept of performance emphasizes workers' agency, but as McKenzie points out, failure to perform "proactively" ironically has the same consequences as failure to be disciplined did in an earlier age. I think that these two associations, between performance and gender and perfor- mance and organizational or worker efficiency, are connected; both are related to the restructuring of the U.S. economy. The 1980s and 1990s was a period which saw the decline of traditional American manufacturing, and the rise of the service, informa- tion, and high-tech sectors, along with the increasing feminization of labor - the steady increase in the percentage of women working outside the home, the expansion of labor sectors traditionally considered "women's work," and the increasing require- ment for "feminine" skills in many middle-class jobs. The earliest workers to see their labor explicitly as "performance" (after professional entertainers, of course) were women in the pink collar sector. Arlie Hochschild's classic study of airline steward- esses ( The Managed Heart , 2003[1983]) showed that these women talked about the "emotion work" required by their jobs explicitly as "acting a role."6 As Hochschild noted, jobs that required emotion work were among the fastest growing parts of the labor market in the U.S. in the 1980s. In other words, performance studies was recognizing gender identity as performance at the same time that sociology was recognizing the performance of femininity (and in some cases masculinity) as an important aspect of labor in the deindustrializing world. In sum, the model of performance emerged in response to developments in media technologies and economic restructuring but also participated in those structural transformations. I believe that implicit models of animation are already doing the same work in computerized, postindustrial societies, and in the following sections, I want to try to begin making those models more explicit. Animation: Définitions Following in the footsteps of performance studies, let me start by cobbling together a rough definition of animation that can productively incorporate approaches from the arts, anthropology, and psychology. All of these approaches retain something of the etymological sense of animation as "breathing life into" a thing, but each defines "life" in a slightly different way. From the perspective of professional animators and arts scholars, animation is primarily defined as a medium. The most common contemporary use of the term animation (or "anime") refers to a genre of film or video, and most academic theoriz- ing of animation has taken place within film and media studies. Animation in this sense is defined in opposition to "live action" cinema or television and includes eel animation and computer-generated animation (both 2D and 3D, both in film and games), as well as a wide variety of techniques such as claymation, stop-motion, paper cut-out animation, and so on.</page><page sequence="5">426 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology Cinema studies writes the history of animation in terms of the remediation of the visual arts, particularly drawing, painting, and photography (there has been some work on sound in animation, but as in cinema studies generally, surprisingly little). Here, the history of animation is traced through devices such as the stereopticon and Muybridge's photography, and Alan Cholodenko (2007) makes the compelling argu- ment, based on this technological history, that all cinema is, in fact, animation, because film itself is a technology whose primary effect is the illusion of movement created through the rapid sequence of still frames. But cinema is only one recent medium of animation, and the scope of an arts definition of animation should include all the older media which cinema animation remediates - story-scrolls and comic books, for instance, as well as all forms of puppetry - marionettes, glove puppets, rod puppets, shadow puppets, and so on. Puppeteers and puppetry studies define animation in opposition to live theater, by the presence of "performing objects/' including not only puppets, but masks and automata (Proschan 1983). In sum, the arts (including media studies) definition of animation focuses on techne, on a range of technologies and skills that are used to create the "illusion of life." To come up with an anthropological concept of "cultural animation" that can do similar work to Singer's "cultural performance," let me turn first, as performance studies did, to the anthropology of religion. Where the Ur-cultural performance was religious ritual, the Ur-cultural animation is the investment of icons, effigies, talis- mans, and natural objects with divine power, what Victoria Nelson refers to as "practices of 'en-souling' matter" (2001:30). Within anthropology, the most well articulated theory of animation is probably Alfred Gell's (1998) analysis of how sacred objects are invested with their own agency - both through formal qualities that abstractly represent cultural concepts of personhood and through human interaction with them. Mauss' theorization of the gift as a part of the self invested in an object and Marx's theory of the commodity fetish might both be seen as an expansion of the anthropological model of animation beyond the overtly religious sphere. If performance studies took its psychological model from Lacan's mirror stage, animation studies would look more to object-relations theory. For Judith Butler, Lacan's description of the mirror stage provides the model for how individuals come to embody social roles, particularly gender roles. In the mirror stage, when the infant first sees its reflection in a mirror, it misrecognizes the image as an idealized self, and tries to control what it sees through its own movements. In Butler's model, individu- als throughout their lives continually misrecognize external images as idealized selves and embody gender and other roles through continual acts of mimesis which become habitual, although, like the infant's uncoordinated movements, their perfor- mances always fail to completely reconstruct the imaginary ideal. D.W. Winnicott's concept of the transitional object provides a way of thinking about animation as a complementary universal psychic process, one which is as crucial to the processes of socialization and individual development as performance, and is inseparable from them. In early infancy, introjection of the m/other into the self and projection of the self into the m/other are virtually indistinguishable. According to Winnicott (1971), children are usually attached to transitional objects - often blan- kets or stuffed toys - for a period in infancy. The transitional object is simultaneously "me" and "not me" for the child. These objects are an important part of the child's development, comforting her through the gradual realization that the mother and the world "the mother brings to the child" are independent from the child's own desire. Performance (e.g., playing cops and robbers, dressing up) and animation (e.g., play with dolls, stuffed toys, Matchbox cars, etc.) are probably both universal forms of children's play. Both forms of play exist in the space where "me" and "not me" merge. Play, thus defined, is, according to Winnicott, vital to developing the human capacity for creativity, not just in childhood, but throughout life. If Butler's reading of Lacan posits performance as the introjection of the environment into the self, a psychic theory of animation focuses on the projection of the self into the environment. In both</page><page sequence="6">Animation: The New Performance? 427 cases, the transitional space is where boundaries between self and world are encoun- tered, crossed, and reconstructed. Drawing on all of these approaches, let us provisionally define animation as broadly as possible, as the projection of qualities perceived as human - life, power, agency, will, personality, and so on - outside of the self, and into the sensory environment, through acts of creation, perception, and interaction. This projection, like any human expression, requires a medium, and we can take the comparative study of technes of animation - in art, in religion, in everyday life - as the goal of an anthropology of animation. Hopefully this definition not only covers a wide range of cultural prac- tices, from animism to robotics, but also emphasizes the importance of analyzing such practices for the anthropological project of exploring differences in how the human and the nonhuman are defined and how the self and the world are experienced. Remediation and Reflexivity Digital animation seems to be reaching the kind of first Golden Age that cinema reached in the 1930s, and television in the 1950s and 1960s, where certain ways of using the new media technologies, certain genres and formats, are becoming estab- lished as standard, and an industrial structure is becoming more or less stable. As with cinema and television, with digital media, the mainstream is defined by a trend toward increasing verisimilitude and immersive effects. This is especially apparent in animated cinema and gaming, where the goal of creating increasingly lifelike images (more detailed texturing, smoother movement, 3D) is taken for granted by programmers and designers in large companies such as Pixar Studios and Blizzard Entertainment. Just as avant-garde performance artists and theorists in the 1930s and 1960s chal- lenged the naturalist conventions of classical Hollywood cinema and television drama by emphasizing the nonrealist elements of live theater and ritual, contempo- rary avant-garde animators and animation theorists are emphasizing the reflexive effects of earlier technes of animation (effects which may have been unintentional and only come to light in comparison with more recent animation styles).7 Avant-garde performance artists and theorists since Brecht have focused on the duality of actor and role. Judith Butler posits that such reflexivity actually exposes the ontological sameness of the two - that the actor's "real" social self is as much an effect of embodied, mimetic performance as is the onstage character. Avant-garde puppe- teers and theorists of puppetry focus on the duality of puppeteer and puppet, but tend to see self-reflexive puppetry as revealing antinomies at the heart of human existence - body and soul, manipulation and free will, objective reality and subjective imagination. One of the most influential animators exploring the relationship between technol- ogy and ontology is Japanese auteur director Oshii Mamoru. Oshii's oevre (especially the Ghost in the Shell series) explores the nature of the human and the nonhuman through dense narratives about a future world in which human souls are "hacked" into a wide range of media/ objects - mechanical bodies, prostheses, puppets, cyber- space itself. Oshii cites a wide range of academic theory in his art (one of his charac- ters is named after Donna Haraway, for example), and some of the most interesting academic cultural contextualizations and elaborations of the animation trope come out of critical studies of Oshii's work (e.g., Bolton 2002; Brown 2008; Orbaugh 2008). The ethnography of virtual worlds and communities is another site where the antinomies of animation are being explored, and where predigitai technologies of animation have provided productive models for thinking about the ontology of avatars and mediated social spaces. In his review of Tom Boellstorff s Second Life and other recent studies of virtual worlds, Paul Manning (2009) draws on Prague School and Russian Modernist theories of puppetry (e.g., Bogatyrev, Meyerhold) in order to construct a basis for comparing how different technes construct mediated selves and draw the boundaries between the imaginary and the real. In the following section, I</page><page sequence="7">428 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology want to expand on this work to outline a few characteristics of animation which make it work particularly well as a trope for thinking about culture in a world of globalized computer technology. Creator/Character Ratio Although there are many ways in which performance and animation overlap, a noted difference between them is the ratio of creator (s) to character(s) (Kaplin 2001). In performance, whether it be theatrical performance, the performance of ritual, or the performance of self in everyday life, one body can only inhabit one role at a time. There are forms of puppetry in which one puppeteer voices and manipulates one character, but these are rare. More usual are forms like wayang kulit, in which one puppeteer moves and voices all of the characters, or bunraku, in which several people are responsible for creating a single character. Both ends of the puppeteer-to- character ratio have their parallels in contemporary digital culture. On the one hand, many analyses of the experience of working on computers, especially of participating in virtual communities, note that playing multiple roles is a very common experience. In discussions of American online communities, the trope of "multiple personalities" or "split personalities" is often used to describe the effect of working in several windows, and creating a different persona in each one, at the same time - what Kate Bornstein and Caitlin Sullivan call "splattering" identity (Bornstein 1998:212-225). It is perhaps no accident that Bornstein has long been involved in transgender activism and also is hirself a performance artist. It may be that this sense of newness, of exhilaration and terror, that many experience while creating multiple characters in online space, is at least in part related to their reading of their online action as performance. Thinking of online role-playing as animating, rather than performing, might help us to localize these experiences in place and time. We might ask, for instance, whether young people who grew up doing much of their communication through MSN and cellphone texting, or who grew up in societies such as Indonesia where master puppeteers are powerful social and religious figures, experience having multiple online personae in the same way. At the same time, contemporary manga, anime, and logo characters are often acknowledged as the creations of collectives, rather than auteurs. The fact that many people contribute to a live cinema performance (including the scriptwriter, director, cinematographer, lighting director, etc.) is certainly an aspect of cinema, but one that, under the performance paradigm, received very little attention. In anime and manga, the characters may still be seen as auteur creations (think of Disney and Miyazaki), but fans, and many scholars, often see the sense that these characters have lives of their own as arising from their re-creation in numerous media and styles by hun- dreds, thousands of fans. Of course, media fans were writing their own stories and making artwork based on their favorite characters back in the days of the mimeo- graph, but the Internet has increased the range of media through which fans recreate the characters and intensified the replication of images and narratives. Animated characters "belong" to fans in a different way than embodied human stars like Marilyn Monroe or Mick Jagger. And in the age of what Henry Jenkins (2005) calls "convergence culture," even characters originally embodied by human actors are becoming like animated characters in this sense of being collective works.8 The Character as a Construction of Multimedia Codes Roland Barthes, in his influential essay on bunraku, spoke directly to the difference between animation and embodied performance, defining "the Western conception of the theater" as one where the character's coherence ("the illusion of totality") is modeled on the presumed organic coherence of the human body. In bunraku, by contrast, the character is composed of separated media - the puppet itself, its manipu- lation by actors visible behind and beside it, the voice of the singer who sits by the</page><page sequence="8">Animation: The New Performance? 429 stage and recites the dialogue. "By the discontinuity of the codes, by this caesura imposed on the various features of representation, . . . the copy elaborated on the stage is not destroyed but somehow broken, striated, withdrawn from that mét- onymie contagion of voice and gesture, body and soul, which entraps our actors" (Barthes 1982:54-55). Many scholars see this striation as a defining characteristic of puppetry in general, and Steve Tillis classifies puppetry forms based on the technolo- gies and styles of "the three sign-systems of the puppet": design, movement, and speech (1992:118).9 The question of whether puppetry is therefore a unique form of expression, or merely a particularly "pure" example of the construction of character through systems of code which is characteristic of all performance has been a fraught one since the debates between Prague School semioticians Otakar Zich and Pietr Bogaty- rev in the 1930s. Scott Cutler Shershow (1995) has shown that this debate was irre- solvable, since it inevitably boiled down to ideological associations of drama and puppetry with high versus low culture. An anthropology of animation could retain the basic insight that the difference between embodied performance and media- striated animation matters, but treat the question of how it matters as an ethno- graphic, rather than philosophical, problem. In other words, we can see specific animation practices as microcosmic instantiations of broader "media ideologies" (see Gershon, this volume). Thus we could, for example, move beyond critiques of Barthes' self-conscious Orientalism to ask how Japanese artists and audiences talk about the differences between bunraku and kabuki, and how this discourse might relate to Japanese philosophies of personhood.10 The striation of different media has also been noted as one of the characteristics of communication through digital media. Paying attention to how different sign systems and media are organized in relation to each other in, for example, the design of online games or social networking sites, can tell us something about contemporary concepts of the sign. For instance, Manning suggests that comparing how characters are voiced, both in terms of through which medium (as in the debates in Second Life over the introduction of voice technology vs. text chat) and in what registers, might be "revelatory of our own complex and fraught actual world semiotic ideologies about the category of the voice, so often a proxy for notions of the authentic self" (2009:318). The Object-Person Older media fan cultures, as analyzed under the performance paradigm, were seen as based on acts of identity /identification. That is, the transitional space of broadcast media fandom has been described largely in terms of the introjection of the idealized other into the self. In contrast, it is striking how little the idea of identity or identifi- cation appears in recent work on digitally mediated subcultures. The relationship between fan and animated character tends to be read in terms of alterity rather than affinity; animated characters are not so much introjected role models as psychically projected objects of desire. The idea of animation fandom as fetishism has been articulated most often in recent theorizing of the subculture of young, male Japanese manga and anime fans, or otaku. Otaku are rarely described as identifying with animated characters, in the sense of feeling that the character is like them, or that they would like to be like the character, or in the sense of experiencing the fictional world as the character experiences it, although, of course, they do do this. But the focus in both popular and academic studies tends to be on the otaku's obsessive collection of DVDs and figurines, and their intense erotic and emotional attachment to the material form of the characters as what distinguishes them from fans in general. The particular nature of otaku fetishism is summed up in the word moe, which refers to the strong feeling of attraction or affection for an animated character. The word is usually written with the character for "to /sprout" but also sometimes with</page><page sequence="9">430 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology the character for "burn/ing"; the characters are homonyms, and moe's use plays on both meanings. Moe can be either an adjective or a verb. It can refer either to the intense "burning" emotion felt by a fan toward a character, or the "sprouting" of that feeling in the fan. It also refers to a quality of the character, that is, the character's ability to elicit intense affect in the fan. One can say, for instance, "Sailor Moon is so moe!" or "I really moe Sailor Moon!" or "I've been moe-ed by Sailor Moon!"11 The term is used in some different ways by male and female fans. Women fans in Taiwan, for example, often speak of "moe-points" referring most often to narrative situations, in particular relationships between two male characters (e.g., brothers, teacher/ student), from which new homoerotic stories about them "sprout up" in the fan's mind (see Silvio, 2010). According to Azuma Hiroki (2009), otaku tend to fixate on what he calls "moe-elements" - formal qualities of a character, such as a maid's costume, blue hair, cat ears, or a lisp.12 Azuma relates contemporary otaku's fixation on moe-elements, as opposed to earlier generations of (male) fan's more intense engagement with narrative, to the structure of digital technology. Otaku subculture is characterized by what he calls "database consumption." For instance, Azuma writes, in the popular search engine TINAMI, "As soon as the characters are created, they are broken up into elements, categorized, and registered to a database" (2009:47), which allows otaku to find or generate characters who are basically bundles of specific moe-elements. Moe-elements are, in a sense, essential to all animation - when the human is defined in terms of affect, it can only be projected into the material world via con- ventionalized signifiers. A characteristic of animation that comes with the striation of media is the simplification of each medium's sign system in comparison with the organically integrated sign systems of embodied performance (this is what we mean when we say an image or performance is "cartoony"). A comparative anthropology of animation should pay attention not only to the relationships among media, but also to the nature of the signs in each one. In many forms of animation, specific formal qualities stand for specific character traits. For example, in traditional Chinese hand-puppetry, a red face indicates loyalty, a mole in the center of the forehead indicates a merciful character, and so on. What is special about the animation techne of otaku is that it simultaneously homogenizes affect (condensing a range of emotional responses into the single term moe) and proliferates conventionalized affect-signs (moe-elements) across a range of media. This makes the arbitrariness of the relationship between material qualities and emo- tional states explicit. Japanese psychologist Saito Tomaki has argued that it is, in fact, the gap between their fantasies and their everyday sexual lives that characterizes the sexuality of the otaku (male manga and anime fan) and the yaoi fan (women who write homoerotic stories about manga and anime characters). He writes: Otaku and yaoi fans are fetishists to the extent that we all are - in the sense that when we desire an object, what we desire is something the object fundamentally lacks. But while the rest of us are usually unaware of this lack, otaku are conscious of it to some extent. In other words, they realize that the object of their desire is nothing more than a fiction. [Saito 2007:237] We might reframe this self-conscious fetishism in terms of the difference between performance and animation. In other words, we could say that otaku and yaoi fans are not so much conscious of "lack," as that they simply do not experience the personality as an organic totality in the first place. Cuteness, Branding, and the Labor of Animation One notable characteristic of much of the animation in postindustrial societies is cuteness. While cuteness is a part of animation for children almost everywhere, its increasing popularity among adults has been associated with the globalization of Japanese media products and character goods.</page><page sequence="10">Animation: The New Performance ? 431 Most of the research on the Japanese kawaii (cute) aesthetic has been framed in terms of performance. Sharon Kinsella (1995) argues, for instance, that the perfor- mance of cute identities among young Japanese (especially women) expresses their dissatisfaction with the disciplinary restrictions associated with adult social life (especially the role of housewife). Looking at cuteness as an aspect of animation, on the other hand, may lead us to see cuteness more as a projection of adults already implicated in the transforming economy If the performance paradigm institutionalized during a period when the service sector, especially pink-collar labor, was expanding, the newest part of the current "new economy" is what is often called the "creative industries" or the "content industries."13 This includes, of course, the work of producing manga, anime, and computer games, but also design, advertising, and licensing, which are moving closer to the model of animation. One of the most prominent uses of animated cartoon characters today is as brand logos or mascots, personifications of corporations and other organizations. This may be particularly true in Asia. In Taiwan, for example, the list of entities represented by cartoon characters includes banks and life insurance companies, gas companies, restaurant chains and snack foods, electronics manufacturers and real estate agencies, agricultural associations, temple alliances, urban neighborhoods, the 2010 Interna- tional Floral Expo, and the national postal service. These cartoon characters are designed to attach the consumer's positive feelings to both the products or services produced by an organization and to the organization itself. Manning, summarizing recent work on the semiotics of branding, writes that in some contemporary brand discourse, "the pervasive associations based on the role brands play in consumers' lives are transformed into actual anthropomorphic characteristics imputed to brands understood as holistic, organic, living, growing entities with which consumers can form actual social relationships directly" (2010:36). If there is an equivalent in the animation model to the punitive power (perform or else!) that McKenzie finds in the business model of performance as efficiency, it probably lies in the command to brand. Branding makes the value of nonmaterial labor legible, turning qualities - goodwill, recognition, affect - into products that can be sold. Not only corporations, but individuals and nations, are coming to see the brand as the primary repository of value and branding as a precondition for action in the world. Performance Studies has focused primarily on the expressive aspect of communication - on how the performer produces meaning - rather than on the inter- pretation of performative acts. One of the characteristics of animation, however, is that much responsibility for communication is given to the receiver, and that anima- tors and their audiences are aware of this. For this reason, one of the key character- istics of many animated characters is incompleteness. As Ivan Koos of the Budapest State Puppet Theatre puts it: The most important thing in the visual representation of the puppet stage is that it sets something going in the spectator's imagination without finishing the process. At a certain point the idea is left open to be completed by the spectator . . . Take a familiar example: some of the puppets have no mouths, yet the spectator has the feeling that at certain appropriate moments the puppet smiles or gives expression to its sentiments by facial mimicry, [cited in Tillis 1992:116] Character designers I have interviewed in Taiwan see this kind of incompleteness as a crucial aspect of logo characters in particular (as opposed to anime or game characters) - think of the mouthless, nearly blank circle that is Hello Kitty, arguably the most successful branded character in the world. As Sharon Kinsella (1995) and Inuhiko Yomota (2007) point out, objects and people are perceived as cute when they are seen to have the qualities of innocence and vulnerability, when they elicit feelings of pity and protectiveness. As Kinsella argues, one of the ironies of performed cuteness is that it requires a great deal of work and</page><page sequence="11">432 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology forethought to give the impression of incompetence and spontaneity. But the irony of cute cartoon characters is somewhat different. Their vulnerability is semiotic - the more open they are to the projection of different affects, the cuter they are. Any power they have comes from the external world, from the anonymous crowd. The vulnerability of logo characters speaks, then, quite directly to the vulnerability of the creative industries themselves. Cute brand characters are in a sense meta- brands, for they are not only designed to symbolize and promote the abstract entities of corporations, they embody the vulnerability of branding itself - their utter depen- dence on the unpredictable and unknowable hearts of anonymous, unstructured masses.14 Performance and Animation Together Thus far, I have been exaggerating the differences between performance and animation - performance involves embodiment, introjection, mimesis, and self- identity; animation involves disembodiment, projection, alterity, and the object world, and so on. Even theoretically, these differences are tenuous; in practice, per- formance and animation are even harder to separate. In the contemporary cinema, for example, live-action films are full of animated special effects; human embodiment is critical to the process of motion capture, a key technique in digital animation; the same stories and characters are transferred constantly between live action and ani- mated film (live action remakes of The Flintstones and Blood: the Last Vampire, a cartoon version of Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, etc.). In the following section, I want to give examples of some of the different ways that performance and animation interact in postindustrial cultures outside of the entertainment industry, in subcul- tural and daily practices. I focus on the semiotic and media ideologies in play in these different situations, particularly how different interactions between performance and animation are structured by, and serve to construct, other social formations such as gender, generation, and class. Animation as the Construction of Self-Identity The most visible areas where the social functions of performance have been remedi- ated through animation are probably online communications and the building of virtual communities. This includes not only the animated characters through which people interact in online games, but the ubiquitous animated emoticons that create affect in text messages sent through cellular phones and MSN networks. The move in the development of virtual communities from pure text to text-plus-animation has been seen as "natural" - but I believe we can see this impulse as cultural, as emerging from specific traditions of interaction between performance and animation, rather than as a characteristic of either universal human nature or the technology itself. In online communities/ games such as Second Life, Ryzom, Lineage II, or Final Fantasy, the participant/ player must represent himself or herself through an ani- mated character. In the U.S., where the software for these networks was developed in California alongside New Age ideology, the name for such a character is taken from the Hindu/ Buddhist religious vocabulary - avatar, the embodied form of a deity.15 Puppeteers such as Mark Tillis see such avatars as puppets created and manipulated through new technology (2001). But many other participants in virtual worlds, espe- cially in the U.S., think of avatars as expressions of self. I, Avatar, Mark Stephen Meadows' description of the nature of identity in cyberspace, is an excellent example of how the digital animation model is linked to the remediation of specific local performance traditions across the fields of play and work. Meadows compares the virtual community of Second Life and similar online social spaces to Hollywood in the 1920s. Both communities, he argues, attracted huge numbers of new "immi- grants" who were trying to live out their fantasies and construct new identities for themselves, and both were driven by work in the newest medium of mass commu-</page><page sequence="12">Animation: The New Performance? 433 nication (Meadows 2005:7-8). For Meadows, digital animation remediates cinema's remediation of the actor. The actor's physical body is no longer itself the medium of expression, but the cinematic performance and the avatar both carry on the functions of constructing and presenting a public self and (potentially) making a living. For Meadows and others, the avatar also works as a sort of Lacanian mirror-image that is imagined and then constructed by the user, but in turn can also transform the user's/ performer's experience of self-identity (e.g., see Dibbell 1998). Another kind of animated character used to express identity is the emoticon. In East Asia, what started as simple facial expressions represented through common keyboard symbols (e.g., :) for a smile) has now developed through more elaborate keyboard cartoons (e.g., for surprise) to complete animated characters, such as Taiwan's Wan Wan and Onion Head (both of these are now licensed characters and appear on a wide variety of stationery products and toys, as well as in the form of digital images).16 These characters are developed by individual designers and used in their blogs to illustrate and create affect as they narrate their daily lives. Others can download these character emoticons for use in their own online communications. These figures are, like the logo characters discussed above, drawn extremely simply, and the cartoon images are often framed in boxes and captioned ("Go go go!," "Angry!," "Happy!" etc.). The emoticon is an icon of generic affect, rather than individual identity, and it remediates the pose. The conventionalized, held pose is a key part of the structure of such traditional East Asian performance genres as Peking Opera and kabuki, where it condenses the character's emotional state and often signals a narrative climax. Conventionalized poses are also a common way that manga and anime characters are invested with affect. The emoticon images of Wan Wan or Onion Head serve the same function, allowing individuals to narrate their own emotional lives through the medium of animation. Embodied Performance as Self- Animation The practice of cosplay - dressing up as animated characters - can be seen as a reme- diation in the opposite direction, remediating digital animation into embodied per- formance. The "same" practice of embodiment may be experienced very differently, however, through the lenses of performance and animation.17 Susan Napier's ethnography of American manga and anime cosplayers, for instance, reveals that these young people tend to see cosplay as acting out roles, at times even using method acting techniques, such as writing backstories for their characters, to get into character (Napier 2007). In contrast, in my own fieldwork with Taiwanese cosplayers who dress as puppet characters, I found that the vast majority saw cosplay as reanimating the characters by substituting the human body for the wooden one. Their performances consisted mostly of still posing for photographs, and they did not try to stay in character if a camera was not present. When they performed skits, they often maintained puppetry's striation of media, lip-synching, and posing to pre-recorded dialogue (often with all the characters voiced, as in the Taiwanese puppetry tradition, by a single person) (Silvio 2006). The conventional poses of emoticons are also embodied as part of the performative style of many East Asian youth cultures (e.g., the performance of cuteness). Some of these poses incorporate conventionally iconic elements. For example, Japanese and Taiwanese young people, during the course of a conversation, may hold up three fingers of one hand and move their hand in a downward motion beside their face. This gesture imitates the downward lines which are drawn in manga beside a char- acter's face to indicate extreme stress or embarrassment (///), often said to be an abstracted icon of sweat running down - making the gesture an embodied remedia- tion of what is already a conventionalized icon of embodied affect. The convoluted travels of the pose, from theater to manga and anime, from manga and anime to</page><page sequence="13">434 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology emoticons and cosplay, from emoticons and cosplay to everyday comportment, reflect long and continuous histories in which human theater and puppetry, performance and animation, have been intertwined. The Romance of Performance and Animation One of the reasons that the Japanese male otaku subculture seems so extreme, the classic example of a "pure" animation culture, has to do, I think with the relative lack of integration between emotional work and programming work in Japan. These two kinds of labor are divided along gender lines almost everywhere in the post- industrial world, but in Japan, the role of facilitating communication seems to fall even more disproportionately on women. We might then read the popular online novel/ manga/ film Densha Otoko ( Train Man) as a fantasy about the complementary union of performance and animation. In Densha Otoko , an unnamed 22-year-old "typical Akihabara otaku" falls in love with an older OL (office lady) after rescuing her from an abusive drunk on the train. The hero works as a computer techie for a business firm. He spends his nights in an anony- mous online forum where participants chat and exchange ASCII art (cartoon images created with keyboard symbols). The OL's work involves dealing with her firm's foreign clients. Speaking English is, of course, a sign of the woman's upper-class status, but it is also significant that her work is facilitating communication. The course of the romance consists primarily of the woman, aided by the otaku's virtual network of anonymous friends, teaching the otaku literally how to act - how to play the role of boyfriend, how to dress and order in a restaurant, how to express his feelings verbally. In exchange, the otaku helps her navigate technology. In the film, the OL reveals that one of the things that most moved her was when the otaku rearranged her sugar cubes into a pyramid - an act with doll-house play overtones, which might be seen as an act of animation, of reenchanting the real world by creating a separate, miniature fantasy space within it.18 Conclusion Henry Jenkins notes a recent shift in the structure of the global entertainment indus- try toward "world making" - rather than producing just films, or games, or comic books, networks of artists, corporations, and fans are collectively producing trans- media environments in which characters and narratives continually evolve (2005:113- 122). If television's remediation and ubiquitization of drama, along with the growth and feminization of the service industry, pushed scholars to explore the relationship between performance and identity, this trend toward world making as popular entertainment and work is a sign that it might be time to start exploring the relation- ship between animation and environment. Performance studies taught us that "acting" is not just something set apart from reality, but a model of and for the process through which real identities are constructed. What I suggest here is that we can begin to think of animation as more than an entertainment medium, as a possible mode of performative (real, social) world making. I see this essay as a first step in constructing a general concept of animation as one model for human action in the world, in the hopes that animation might provide some of the kinds of insights that the concept of performance has provided across academic disciplines. I have tried to integrate the models of performance and anima- tion, in order to bring some of the key foci of performance studies (e.g., identity, social reproduction, and social transformation) to bear on the study of digital techno- cultures, and to suggest some of the characteristics of animation (e.g., the organiza- tion of striated media) as possible foci for new research on computer-mediated identity and community. My main goal here is to construct a platform that will make it possible for us to simultaneously recognize the global effects of the spread of digital technology and the specificity of local techno-cultures.</page><page sequence="14">Animation: The New Performance? 435 Linguistic anthropology is particularly important here, because one of the ultimate goals of an anthropology of animation must be the analysis of media ideologies. The analysis of media ideologies in the context of animation already has a distinguished history Scott Shershow (1995) and Victoria Nelson (2001) have written detailed his- tories of how puppetry has been used, at various times in Western intellectual history, as a metaphor for the relationship between God and man, a model for how political power works, an index of the simple mentality of children and "the folk/7 a model of pure, unmediated authorship or of manipulated, degraded artifice. Ward Keeler's (1987) classic ethnography of wayang kulit explores the role of the master puppeteer, both in Javanese social life and as a symbol. Bolton (2002), Brown (2008), and Orbaugh (2008) have analyzed how Oshii Mamoru uses images of both Japanese and European puppets and dolls to explore the question of what defines the boundary between human and nonhuman. My project in this essay, to set up animation as a platform for the comparative study of how human beings negotiate the relationship between self and world, both includes such projects of intellectual history and, of course, should itself be subjected to cultural and historical contextualization. My definition of animation is admittedly secular, comparativist, and reliant on the genealogy and connotations of a Latinate word that has no close equivalent in many languages. My attempt at transformative mimesis of the structure of performance studies has no doubt failed, as all mimesis must, but I hope that, with your indulgence, these failures might turn out to be productive ones.

I presented earlier versions of this essay at two conferences at the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica - the Asian Digital Cultures 2 conference in July 2009 and the Anthropological Futures conference in June 2010. 1 am grateful to my discussants, Christopher Bolton, Allen Chun, and Irene Fang-chih Yang, as well as Helen Grace, Anne Allison, John McCreery, Greg Urban, Rob Wilson, Michael Dutton, and all the other participants who gave me extremely helpful comments. I also want to thank liana Gershon, Paul Manning, Miyako Inoue, and an anonymous reviewer for their thoughtful, patient, and educational readings of my drafts. 1. Animator Kyle Balda, who has worked as character designer and animation supervisor for Pixar, Industrial Light and Magic, and other large studios, described himself this way at a lecture he gave at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, October 30, 2009. 2. As Manning points out, dolls and automata are at the center of Jentsch's 1906 theorization of the uncanny (unheimlich), which predates that of Freud (Manning 2009:323, fn5). 3. See McKenzie (2001:33-38) for a summary of these histories. 4. Of course, this process began with cinema, and television largely remediated theater through film. But I think Williams' observation that television made (remediated) theatrical performance a larger part of daily life in the industrialized world than cinema had is important. 5. Performance (a kind of action) and performativity (a quality of language) are often mistakenly conflated. The precise nature of the relationship between the two is a central problematic for both queer studies and linguistic anthropology. See, respectively, Parker and Sedgwick (1995) and Hall (2000). 6. Editors' note: Within linguistic anthropology Deborah Cameron's studies of gendered performance of service workers within call centers deserves special mention (Cameron 2000). 7. Thus, for instance, Thomas Lamarre (2009) sees the effect of layered, shifting planes of images that results from the animation stand technology used to make most Japanese anime as offering an alternative to the target-vision perspectivalism of most cinema, which Paul Virilio links to militarism - an offer Lamarre sees auteur animators such as Miyazaki Hayao and Anno Hideaki as taking up quite consciously. The perspective of shifting, layered planes, according to Lamarre, allows for a vision of less violent and hierarchical interaction between self and environment, the human and the nonhuman.</page><page sequence="15">436 Journal of Linguistic Anthropology 8. On the collectively constructed reality of characters, see Jenkins (1992) and Silvio (2008). It is significant that Jenkins uses a story about toys (The Velveteen Rabbit) to explicate how fans engage with the characters and worlds of live-action television serials. 9. We can, of course, add or subtract to this list of sign-systems for different technes of animation. Cinema animation, for example, also involves codes of background music, compo- sition and framing, number of eels projected per second, etc. 10. Christopher Bolton (2002) does something very like this in his article on Oshii's reme- diation of bunraku in Ghost in the Shell 11. This is how the term is used in Taiwan, at least. 12. Azuma presents himself as a theorist of the postmodern condition in Japan and in general, but nearly all of his analyses are of practices associated with male otaku, ignoring women's distinctive fan practices. I cite Azuma here as one of the most sophisticated theorists of the relationship between digital animation culture and contemporary Japanese masculinity. 13. There are also fields within scientific and IT research that might be seen as kinds of animation - artificial life, robotics, and human-computer interface design, for example. These fields have been prominent in the emerging field of the sociology/ anthropology of science. 14. See Allison (2009) on the connection between the vulnerability of young workers in Japan's increasingly precarious economy and the imaginative, affective skills that drive the animation industry there. Character designers in Japan and Taiwan, where marketing research has been (at least until very recently) rarely used, or is something done "on the go," may feel this vulnerability particularly strongly. But even in large multinational corporations where end-user focus groups and audience ethnography are de rigeur, the attempt to know and fix the relationship between material qualities and affects may simply intensify anxiety. It makes sense that cute characters have played such an important role as global ambassadors for the Japanese content industries - in situations where producers and consumers are culturally distant, semiotic vulnerability is intensified. 15. Interestingly, in my anecdotal experience, gamers in Taiwan, who grew up with Buddhist/ Taoist religious practice, do not use this term, preferring to simply call their game characters "characters" or by more specific variations such as "my wizard," "my elf," and so on. 16. Many keyboard face cartoons that are now popular throughout East Asia were invented by Japanese girls specifically for cell-phone texting (see Miller 2004, 2005). To see Wan Wan's emoticon characters, you can go to her blog: http://www.wretch.cc/blog/cwwany. Onion Head's emoticons are introduced on the Onion Club blog at http://blog.roodo.com/ onion_club / archives / cat_109038.html. 17. Gagne (2008) interviewed Japanese Goth/Lolitas (young women who dress in elaborate cute /Baroque style) who distinguish themselves from cosplayers by claiming that they are expressing their true selves while cosplayers are merely mimicking animated characters. We might see this as a classic example of performance and animation as competing ideological models. 18. At the end of Ocha Machiko's shojo manga (girls' comic) version of the story (Ocha 2006), the only commercial version created by a female artist that I could find, the female lead (drawn much younger than in the movie) reveals her huge collection of dolls, character figurines and stuffed toys to the otaku. From their own perspective, women mediate compe- tencies in both performance and animation, both in their work and private life, rather than embodying a pure performance model (see Silvio 2006).
