<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A DOUGHNUT-SHAPED VESSEL FROM KAMINALJUYO, WITH A DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THIS UNUSUAL FORM LEE A. PARSONS ABSTRACT A rare ceramic form commonly called the doughnut- shape is reported for Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala, Miraflores phase. This specimen provides another example of the stucco technique on Pre-Classic pottery. A trial distribu- tion of doughnut-shaped vessels is plotted for the Ameri- cas. Although this chart is based upon only a few pub- lished illustrations, certain deductions can be made as to the value of this form as a horizon marker. The horizon- tal variety of doughnut vessel may be a good marker for the Late Pre-Classic horizon in Mesoamerica. KAMINALJUYO is the large pre-Columbian ceremonial center on the western edge of modern Guatemala City. A number of curio shops in the city regularly sell an- tiquities, most of which come from housing develop- ment excavations on this archaeological site. The illus- trated ceramic fragment (Fig. 1) in all probability turned up in this manner, and is now in the writer's collection. The unusual shape, as well as the remains of stucco, makes this specimen worth describing. Tubular, ring-shaped ceramics sporadically occur in Nuclear America (Fig. 2) and have come to be known as "doughnut-shaped" ves- sels (Lothrop 1926: 129). Doughnut-shaped vessels have not been reported previously from Kaminaljuyi. The section shown in Fig. 1 is sufficiently complete to reconstruct the original form as a closed, hollow ring. Very likely an effigy flaring spout provided the only opening. The possibility exists, however, that this face- spout might have been duplicated on the opposite side similar to a doughnut vessel from Costa Rica (Fig. 2, No. 9). The original diameter must have been about 15 centimeters and the "doughnut hole" about 7 centi- meters. The height to the rim of the spout measures 6.3 centimeters and the diameter of the spout 8.3 centi- meters. The base of the ring is flattened. A highly polished red slip (2.5YR4/6, Munsell color system) covers the whole exterior, but the unslipped paste inside the spout is a yellowish tan. Patches of thin white base stucco still adhering to the vessel suggest that the whole vessel had once been stuccoed. The stucco, in turn, was painted a bright pink. The various orifices of the puffed- cheek face are tool-indented. The right eye and the mouth are executed by means of three impressions each. The left eye is varied by use of two broad indentations and a raised eyebrow, imparting added character to the visage. The characteristics of this doughnut vessel best fit the Late Pre-Classic period in Guatemala. The tool-inden- tation technique of forming facial features seems Pre- Classic. Also other known horizontally resting doughnut vessels from Mesoamerica are best placed on the Late Pre-Classic level (Fig. 2). The slip allies it with the Miraflores phase Fine Red ware at Kaminaljuyl, and particularly with the Miraflores-correlated red ware from Finca Arizona on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. An effigy vessel from the latter site (Shook 1945: Fig. 6 e) shows a puffed-cheeked individual with slanted eyes (though of the "coffee bean" type) and was also stucco covered. This specimen as well as several other vessels at Finca Arizona were stuccoed over Usulutan ware, however. Shook and Kidder (1952: 103-7) illustrate three Miraflores phase vessels from mound E-III-3, Kam- inaljuyu (one cylinder, one tetrapod, and one human effigy form), which are also stuccoed over Usulutan ware. The only exceptions to this preference for stuccoing on Usulutan are one black-brown bowl from Finca Arizona (Shook 1945: Fig. 4 c), one fragmentary Fine Red vase from Kaminaljuyui (Shook and Kidder 1952: 92), and the red ware doughnut vessel illustrated here. According to Shepard (Shook and Kidder 1952: 106), Miraflores stucco seems to be of very fine clay in contrast to the calcareous stucco applied to the well-known Early Classic Esper- anza phase vessels, though a Pre-Classic specimen from Tlatilco also has calcareous stucco.

Numbers refer to items in the bibliography; the specimen marked by an asterisk is the same at that illustrated in Fig. 1. (1944) discuss the method of application of Miraflores stucco on ceramics. Our specimen seems to conform to the technique of sizing the polished slip with a wash of reddish clay before the application of the exterior stucco finish. In a footnote, Covarrubius (1957: 95) cites further occurrences of stuccoed ware in the Americas which emphasize both the wide distribution and the great time depth of the tradition. That author prefers to use the term "paint-cloisonne" and also believes that contem- porary lacquer work in Mexico is a continuation of the pre-Columbian stucco technique. It might be of value to review the distribution of doughnut-shaped vessels in the Americas and inquire as to the utility of this form as a "horizon marker" (Par- sons 1957). One might expect diffusion from a single source within Nuclear America because of the originality of the shape. It should be noted at the outset that the more naturalistic animal effigies which lend themselves to coiled positions, such as serpents, fish, and dogs, are as a rule not being included in this distribution. It is prob- able, however, that a close conceptual relationship exists between these representations and the plain doughnut vessel. The chart (Fig. 2) plots 22 examples of the doughnut form taken from published illustrations. Many more examples could be gathered from museum and pri- vate collections, but it is hoped that this sample will indicate the regions where the form might be expected in the future. Except for large geographical gaps be- tween the Caddo area of eastern United States and cen- tral Mexico, and between Costa Rica and Peru, the distri- bution is remarkably continuous. Each doughnut-shaped specimen is placed in its probable time period, which in- dicates certain chronological trends upon analysis. In Mesoamerica there are two horizons that the form seems to be associated with: Pre-Classic (usually Late phase) and Post Classic (Early phase?). A glance at the chart shows that we must make some sort of distinction between those doughnut-shaped vessels which are made to rest in a horizontal position and those which stand vertically. The horizontal examples are al- ways early and the vertical examples most often late. Moreover, the Post Classic vertical forms never have anthropomorphic qualities, while the two Pre-Classic vertical specimens do. Also, the horizontal doughnut shapes tend to have anthropomorphic qualities, usually taking the form of an effigy spout. In Peru, the southernmost region of occurrence, the doughnut-shape is seen to be a tradition on the north coast, from the Mid-Pre-Classic up through the Classic period. Peru is the only area where there is evidence for an unbroken sequence through time and a dispersal of the concept during the Classic period. Since the chart (Fig. 2) was compiled, we can extend the distribution southward during the Classic period. Seler (1961: 312, Fig. 316) illustrates a vertically oriented doughnut-shaped vessel of Nazca polychrome style from the south coast of Peru. I suspect that more examples from Peru will show an even more complex distribution, and for this reason it is doubtful that the form has any value as a horizon marker there. I propose that the concept for the doughnut form originated in Peru, probably during the Chavin period on the north coast. Notice that the Cupisnique doughnut form (Fig. 2, No. 15) is combined with the stirrup spout, also a unique concept in pottery forms. Both the stirrup spout and the doughtnut form are related in that they are tubular constructions. Conceptually, therefore, the doughnut form might be thought of as a closed stirrup spout - in effect, all spout without vessel body. This is particularly evident in the vertical variety of doughnut vessels (Porter 1953: 40). I will not venture to guess which idea came first, nor as to any evolutionary se- quence with coiled animal effigy vessels. Also, because i Q 20 8, a It 387 a 5 8 u a 8 X S</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the doughnut vessels are probably all found in cere- monial contexts, we need not worry too much about any utilitarian function for this form; it is probably the creative elaboration of the concept of tubular construc- tion in pottery vessels. Once invented, the form persisted. It spread north- ward (by sea?) to Mesoamerica during Mid-Pre-Classic times along with the stirrup spout and a complex of techniques and forms such as appear at Tlatilco in cen- tral Mexico. Porter (1953: 27) states that nine examples of the stirrup spout vessel occur at Tlatilco. She also reports one doughnut form, a vertically standing fish effigy, from the same site (Fig. 2, No. 13). These two forms also appeared in Guatemala and El Salvador, possi- bly during Mid-Pre-Classic times. A chocolate-brown ware vessel reputedly from Salcaja, Quetzaltenango (Dieseldorff collection at the National Museum of Ar- cheology and Ethnology of Guatemala, No. MN5309), is of compound form with stirrup spout joining four glo- bular chambers (S. F. Borhegyi notes, 1951). It is possi- ble that the vertical doughnut vessel from eastern El Sal- vador (Fig. 2, No. 4) also represents this first introduc- tion of tubular constructed vessels from Peru. This speci- men is an unpolished monochrome with double-punched eyes and mouth. It is true, however, that this specimen might be of Late Pre-Classic date. To continue the analysis, the examples now available show that the horizontal variety of the doughnut vessel was widely distributed throughout Mesoamerica during the succeeding Late Pre-Classic period. All of these examples are very similar in design, with the exception of Fig. 2, No. 11 and possibly No. 5. Number 11, from Chiapa de Corzo, is a full-standing human figure with staff resting upon a plain hollow ring base. This unusual sample probably has the most reliable time placement ("Proto-Classic"). In Mesoamerica, therefore, it seems that horizontally oriented doughnut vessels may be good markers for the Late Pre-Classic horizon. (For the pur- pose of this paper I am including under this rubric an extended period, from something like 500 B.c. through A.D. 300.) It is too early, however, to accept this thesis without qualification, as further examples and better time correlations may alter the picture. The process of distri- bution probably involved the stimulus diffusion of the idea of a hollow ring shape, for the pastes and surface treatments seem to vary greatly. In this, doughnut ves- sels parallel the distribution of the Usulutan resist tech- nique and the mammiform vessel support form on the same Late Pre-Classic horizon. The vertically oriented plain doughnut vessels appear- ing on the Post Classic horizon in Mesoamerica may be a re-introduction of the form from the south, or a re- vival of the idea by copying from their own Pre-Classic heritage. The illustrated examples possibly represent both Early and Late Post Classic periods, so that their value as precise horizon markers at this time is reduced. The specimen from Mitla is unique in its being carved in alabaster. Finally, there is the isolated example illustrated by Holmes (Fig. 2, No. 2) for the Caddo region of the United States. Stirrup spout vessels are also well known for this region, but the method and the time of diffusion of these forms so far afield is not elucidated by the present study. The recent paper by Sears (1962, Fig. 3 b), however, illustrates a monochrome, horizontally resting doughnut vessel with three vertical spouts from the Gulf coast of Florida. The cultural affiliation of this specimen is Hope- well, and the time period coincides with the Proto-Classic in Mesoamerica, thereby providing an extension of our Late Pre-Classic horizon marker into North America. This well-documented occurrence provides an intriguing hint of relatively rapid coastal or maritime diffusion of a specialized trait over a long distance at the beginning of the Christian era.

MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM Milwaukee, Wisconsin August, 1962 CONTEMPORANEITY AND CROSS- DATING IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION* THOMAS CARL PATTERSON ABSTRACT That cultural units are contemporary merely means that they are assigned to the same arbitrary division of time, or period. The degree of contemporaneity which is implied when units are assigned to the same period de- pends upon the duration of the units and the length of the period. Correlation is the alignment of sequences of units or the placement of units with respect to sequences. Synchronic correlation, or cross-dating, involves assign- ing units to the same period because they are contem- porary. When correlations are based on contemporaneity, detailed interpretations of the archaeological evidence are possible. Precise cross-dating permits more detailed statements about cultural process and relationship. Pre- cise cross-dating is possible when units are assigned to periods which have brief spans in time or when refer- ence is made to a chronological framework which is not defined in terms of the archaeological materials. Cross- dating is most credible when both the sequences of units in the different localities and the patterning of each cul- tural unit are known and understood. IN HIS ADDRESS to the Geological Society in 1862, Thomas Henry Huxley questioned the very foundations upon which the broad outlines of historical geology were built. He suggested that, even though the sequence of fossils is similar in different areas of the world, similarity * A draft of this paper was presented at the spring meeting of the Kroeber Anthropological Society and the Southwestern Anthro- pological Association, Berkeley, April 20, 1962. of succession does not necessarily imply synchrony, or correspondence in age, between different local units with similar fossil remains. In order to express the concept of having a similar place in a sequence which is the same in any part of the world, Huxley coined the term homo- taxis. He then inquired into the meaning of the word contemporaneous as it was used by geologists, and found that it was often employed as a synonym for both homo- taxis and synchrony (Huxley 1896: 275-86). In both archaeology and geology the term contem- poraneous is now most commonly used to mean syn- chrony. When someone says that two units are con- temporary or synchronous, he means that they are not necessarily equivalent in age but only that they can be assigned to the same period - or arbitrary division of time, the beginning and end of which are marked by specified changes. Geological or cultural units which are assigned to the same period may be precisely equiva- lent in age, may overlap in time, or may be of different ages, depending upon the duration of the units and the length of the period to which they are assigned. Correlation is the alignment of sequences of units with respect to one another or the placement of a unit with respect to a sequence. Any relationship that is es- tablished is likely to be called a correlation, regardless of whether it is based on homotaxis or contemporaneity. John H. Rowe (1962: 40) has pointed out that stages are units of similarity which occur in a fixed order. The correlations established between units which are assigned to the same stage of development are homotaxial, be- cause they are based on the similarity of diagnostic cri- teria in the units. Within an area of limited size, units from different localities which are assigned to the same stage of development are usually nearly contemporary with one another; however, when the problem is one of correlating units from distant localities, it has been shown that there is not necessarily a correspondence in age be- tween a unit in one locality which is placed in a particu- lar stage and a unit in a distant locality which repre- sents the same stage of development (Willey and Phil- lips 1958: 66-7). Homotaxial correlations are applicable when one un- dertakes the comparative study of some phenomenon, such as pottery-making, which occurs in different local units. However, when the problems are concerned with establishing the cultural relationships of different local units in a paricular area, or with making interpretations of cultural processes that took place in the area, certain difficulties result from the use of homotaxial correlations. The difficulties are not inherent in the procedure of homotaxial correlation itself, but rather in its association with the use of systems of stages to construct frameworks for the interpretation of archaeological evidence. Rowe (1962: 44) has suggested that these difficulties can be avoided if a system of periods which is based on syn- chronic correlations is used for interpretative purposes. The correlations which are established between units that are assigned to the same period are synchronic, be- cause they are based on the contemporaneity of the units. 389</page></plain_text>
