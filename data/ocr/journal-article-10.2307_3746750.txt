<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS here to read Dr. Whittaker's shorter writings in a single compendious volume. By the same token, as they have all been published before, some a generation ago, comment seems here not to be called for. I shall content myself with a very brief, though a very grateful, notice. The essay on "Reason" is placed first of the reprinted papers, and the remaining chapters are, according to the sub-title of the book, "illustrations" of it. They are in fact both more and less than this. The reader is not, I think, left with the impression that a single thesis has been illuminated by a succession of "illustrations." But that is because the author has not presented the thinkers under review from a single (over-simplified) standpoint. His fairness and breadth of sympathy is indeed proved by his appreciative treatment of philosophers as diverse and as mutually incompatible as Comte, Schopenhauer, and Spinoza. In his opening pages he has something to say of the characteristics of English philosophy; these chapters are a good example of that un-doctrinaire and comprehending sympathy which is perhaps specially a quality of English philosophical criticism at its most humane. If one of the discussions may be selected for separate mention, let it be the last, in which Dr. Whittaker, writing of Spinoza, repudiates the view, so popular in certain quarters abroad, that the chief significance and dominant note in Spinoza's system is to be found in its determined naturalism. The parallels he here adduces between some of Spinoza's utterances and some culled from Bruno and Neo-Platonism are of particular interest. But (if it is not ungrateful to close on a more carping note) I do not think justice can be done to either Comte or Mill if they are run, as here, in double harness. And Dr. Whittaker's estimate of Schopenhauer strikes one as altogether too generous. But it is the kindly English way to admire wrong- headedness if only it is uncompromising enough. J. W. HARVEY. The Behaviour of Animals: An Introduction to its Study. By E. S. RUSSELL, O.B.E., D.Sc., F.L.S. (London: Edward Arnold &amp; Co. I934. PP. viii + I84. Price Ios. 6d.) No science in its inception was ever so richly endowed with subject-matter as was animal psychology, and no endowment could have proved more cumbrous to deal with or more inhibitory to the proper arrangement of an organized branch of knowledge. A wealth of information about the ways of animals, a ready general interest shown by almost everybody in the subject, and an almost inevitable anthropomorphic bias of most observations and interpretations, have always acted as a hindrance to the steady, orderly, and unified growth of a system of scientific generalizations derived from controlled observation and experiment. As a result there is no one science of animal psychology. The more unscientific methods of the naturalist still obtrude themselves into the subject, and laboratory workers still occasionally react to anthropomorphic intrusions by simple mechanistic theories incapable of justification. It is not surprising, therefore, that the subject is open to criticism on many fronts. Dr. Russell's new book is a more searching and a far more responsible indictment than animal psychology usually receives. The terms of his con- demnation will become clearer if his proposals for its improvement are first considered. What he in effect says is: (a) Animal psychology should be abandoned by those trained in the experimental study of behaviour, and handed over to zoologists; (b) all animal activity is linked together within 237</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY a single life-cycle, so that the real "directive" meaning of each individual act of animal behaviour can be defined only in relation to the needs it fulfils within that life-cycle; and (c) rather than continue as we have done by "causal-analytical" laboratory investigation (to use his term for the usually accepted method of scientific investigation), we should use the "direct" method of straightforward observation, preferably in natural surroundings, and develop a science of "broad facts" encompassing everything from ecology to perceptual analysis. The first of these proposals is praiseworthy in its aim to bring animal psychology closer to zoology. It has, however, to be remembered that zoologists and students of animal behaviour are both highly trained in a variety of specialized but separate techniques. It is no more possible for an average scientific worker to perform research in both these fields than it would be for one man to develop physiology and atomic physics adequately and at the same time. Something that each has to say is relevant to the science of animal behaviour, but as a rule it takes two people to say the two things. Admitting, however, that animal psychology reaches into both the zoological and the animal behaviour laboratories, and realizing the difficulty of one man being in both places at once, there have still to be considered Dr. Russell's criticisms of present methods in the study of animal behaviour, and his proposal to replace them by a new direct organismal approach. In Dr. Russell's opinion, the study of animal behaviour has fallen on evil days, because it is sharply divided between the "physiologists"-his general term for experimentalists who study the behaviour of animals by experi- mental laboratory methods, and who attempt to frame their conclusions in the exact language of experimental science-and the "psychologists," who observe the "natural" behaviour of intact animals, mostly in normal sur- roundings, and who describe what they see in simple, plain language-inter- preting as they go along, and as they see fit. Dr. Russell attributes this regrettable dichotomy to the Cartesian view of the dualism of mind and matter, a view to which he does not hold. His argument implies that the "physiologists" investigate animals as "matter," and the "psychologists" investigate them as "mind." Since he disapproves of the application of mechanistic "causal-analytical" methods in the study of animal behaviour, it also suggests that the student who uses these methods necessarily does so in conscious or unconscious, but in either case in misguided, acceptance of the philosophy of Descartes. This is a fair deduction from Dr. Russell's views, but it is a conclusion that is highly questionable. There is only one way of performing acceptable scientific work in biology-by patient observation of situations whose constituent parts are capable of isolation and control, if need be by experiment; and there is only one way of expressing the results of scientific observation-by the use of non-ambiguous "objective" terms which have precise meaning, and if possible by reducing scientific conclusions to generalizations (laws or formulae) of value for purposes of prediction. Animal psychology has been judged in the past, and will continue to be judged, not on the basis of the merits or demerits of classical materialism, but on the basis of its acceptance of this scientific method, and this is a fact which no philosophy, whether mechanistic or vitalistic, can assail. In his other attacks on the "causal-analytical" approach to the study of animal behaviour, Dr. Russell freely lays himself open to counter-attack. For example, he is quite unjustified in his wholesale condemnation, without proper examination, of what he calls "the mechanistic reflex theory." The more radical mechanists probably err in the extent to which they push their 238</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS facts, but in spite of their mistakes there is a large body of data regarding the "reflex" in behaviour, and a superstructure of theory, which are quite irrefutable. Dr. Russell also misrepresents what is the generally recognized scientific approach to studies of animal behaviour. Thus, he contends that "the mechanistic method ... regards behaviour as being directly determined by the physical and chemical stimuli impinging upon the sense organs of the animal. It excludes the possibility that the animal exhibits directive activity in relation to its needs, and that it responds to its own perceptual field." This is a wholly unfair and incorrect statement of any mechanistic view of animal behaviour, however radical, and the force of its condemnation by Dr. Russell hardly equals that with which it would be greeted by any serious and responsible mechanist.' Not only does "mechanistic" animal psychology recognize the existence of "needs" in animals (e.g. sex, hunger, etc.); it has devoted considerable trouble to defining them, to discovering how they influence overt behaviour, to measuring their relative strengths, and where possible to elucidating their physiological backgrounds. To-day, the study of what are called animal "drives" forms no small part of animal psychology. From the point of view of the mechanistic approach, animals are unques- tionably recognized as living creatures whose activities are directed or driven along specific channels by specific bodily processes. "Reflex theory" only enters into the picture when attempts are made to explain the constantly changing environmental adjustment of an animal in answer to these drives. Unfortunately for what conviction Dr. Russell's criticisms of modern experimental animal psychology might otherwise carry, his own "direct" and "organismal" methods seem no different in principle from the very methods he discredits. What he proposes is simple objective observation of animal activity in its totality. "Let us think of behaviour," he writes, "as one of the forms of response shown by the organism as a whole." If the mechanistic student of animal behaviour has never taken the trouble to voice these sentiments, there has never been anything in his attitude which has suggested that either direct observation or the proposition that animals are organized systems is a concept to which exception should be taken. But Dr. Russell styles his suggestions a new "organismal" approach to the study of behaviour, affirming his points of view as "organismal" or "holistic." It is here that there seems to be a serious discrepancy between what he declares to be his philosophy and what he regards as the new "method" this philosophy stimulates. In place of the usual "causal-analytical" approach, his advice is to begin with the "whole" and work down to the "parts," and not to work up from the "parts" to the "whole." This method, however, is precisely the "causal-analytical" method that is employed, not only in experimental biology generally, but also in the most mechanistic developments of experi- mental studies of animal behaviour. In biological science, the "whole," as something comprising integrated "parts," is given, and its behaviour has first to be described, before investigation of its integrated parts can properly begin. The problem is not to build up "wholes" out of "parts," but to find "parts" in "wholes." For example, the modern concept of the reflex, so far as gross behaviour is concerned, did not come into being through abstract theorizing. It came by study of animals. On the other hand, the philosophies of holism and its near relative, or double, emergent evolution, owe their primary inspiration to the fact that the gross phenomena of direct experience (e.g. animate and inanimate existents) cannot be reconstructed by the recombination of hypostasized 1 See, for example, C. L. Hull, Psychological Review, I930, 37, p. 242. 239</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY scientific isolates (e.g. electrons and reflexes). Those who, like Dr. Russell, criticize scientific method because the results of scientific analysis do not correspond with what is seen in immediate experience, misconceive the usual direction and intention of scientific investigation. Mechanistic students of comparative psychology have never pretended to do more than try to provide exact descriptions of animal behaviour, and, if possible, to uncover principles -or mechanisms-from which the various phenomena of animal behaviour can in turn be deduced. This method hardly bears any relation to the philosophy of holism-but it is the method by which Dr. Russell himself has made several distinguished contributions to animal psychology. The optimism of Dr. Russell's belief "that we can get a very long way in the study of the behaviour of animals by the use of the simple objective method (simple direct observation) combined with simple experiment," may well be admired, even if it cannot be shared. But only surprise can be felt at his opinion that "it should be possible to determine by direct observation, preferably of animals in their natural surroundings, exactly to what they do respond." The whole experience of animal psychology has proved the fallacy of this expectation. Even the attempt to discover if an animal has colour-vision, a problem which at first sight appears very simple, is fraught with pitfalls for the unwary. An animal that appears to be responding to the colour of an object may in fact be responding to its brightness, to its shape, or even to some unsuspected element in the background. Attempts to short-cut proper scientific investigation of the perceptual world of animals cannot fail to lead back to blatant anecdotalism. In spite of the contradictions in Dr. Russell's book, there is much of value to be learned from it. But the contradictions are by no means few. Mechanism as a philosophy is severely assailed, but descriptions of animal behaviour framed in the extremest mechanistic terms are quoted with approval. Simple experiment only is advised, but the conclusions of most elaborate experi- mental investigations are adduced to drive home one point after another. The value of the book lies essentially in the fact that it draws attention to a sphere of animal psychology-namely, the behaviour patterns which make up the whole life-cycle-which tends to be forgotten in the press of laboratory investigation. Its value would have been much greater if Dr. Russell had made his plea for the study of behaviour by the methods of the naturalist without attempting to strengthen his arguments by an attack on the methods of experimental animal psychology. S. ZUCKERMAN. Value and Reality in Bradley's Philosophy. By TORGNY T. SEGERSTEDT. (Lund: A. B. Gleerupska Univ-Bokhandeln. I934. Pp. iv + 264. Price 5 Kr.) This book is another sign of the growing interest in English philosophy on the Continent. What is peculiar about it is that it is addressed to English readers in their own language by a continental writer with a particularly wide knowledge of the English literature upon the subject with which it deals, and comes, therefore, as a particularly welcome gift. This circumstance seems to bar meticulous criticism of linguistic details or of what printers call the "format" of the book. Such criticism as would otherwise be permissible only illustrates the extreme difficulty, under present circumstances, of pro- ducing books in the language of one country through the printing-press of another. Leaving the external form and coming to the matter of Dr. Seger- stedt's book, readers of Bradley are familiar with the regrettable absence in 240</page></plain_text>
