Archceologia Japonica , Annotated translations 48 Cultural Assets Report , Saga Prefecture Educational Committee 5 5 Editorial Note About two years ago the problem of how to report on archaeological work done in Japan prompted us to make arrangements for the translation of Archceologia Japonica , the Annual Report of the Japanese Archaeologists Association. We planned a summary of work accomplished, condensations of the reports (to be done by their authors), and an extensive bibliography. Though all the necessary steps had been taken for financing the translation, the project fell through, because of a large cut in the Association's budget. The present report is the result of several compromises between our original plan and a return to the earlier reports which covered only a fraction of a year's research in Japan. It was made possible thanks to the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, which gave us $600 to help translate and publish a much longer and better illustrated paper than would otherwise be possible. As Dr Erika Kaneko, who was to have been in charge of the entire translation of Archceologia Japonica , had done these translations, Dr Yawata asked her to present the report for this issue. Its coverage is limited to the Yayoi and Burial-mound Periods but these it considers in some depth, with reference to articles in Archceo- logia Japonica over several years. In later reports we hope to cover pre-Jömon and some aspects of Jõmon in a similar way and possibly some special foci of the Burial-mound Period. To a considerable degree the report is more than just a summary of a year's archaeological research. Material is being selected, brought together, integrated, and to some extent interpreted, and the result may be con- sidered original work. i. Introduction While selecting field reports from AJ we felt that unless they were set against a general frame of reference they would not be very meaningful. Hence this introduc- tion gives a summary of what is known about the Yayoi and Burial-mound Periods,</page><page sequence="2">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 25 Fig. i.

It is greatly deficient in parts and tentative as far as translation of the Japanese terminology is concerned. The typology and terminology of metal implements are deferred to a later issue. Problems of archaeological terminology and the Japanese approach to terminology are dealt with indirectly and the inclusion of Chinese characters, other than site names, may help students who do not easily read Japanese, and yet try to use Japanese publications. A technical term is usually provided with a Chinese character when it first occurs in the text and the character is repeated only in specially significant contexts. Japanese romanized readings of the Chinese characters are not provided, since we hope at some future date to publish a co-operative article with parallel readings and related terms in Japanese, Chinese, Korean and English. In some cases descriptive denominations have not been literally translated from the Japanese, but replaced by a comparable, descriptive term more familiar to a Western reader than the original Japanese one. Theories have only been included if they seemed reasonably well substantiated and not mere speculations. Controversies are pointed out as such and both sides presented. A critical evaluation of the material has been consciously avoided. For the introductory part I am greatly indebted to the compilers of both Archaeo- logical Dictionaries published in Japanese and to Dr Kim Won-yong's ásŤcfl monograph on Silla pottery.* I also wish to express sincere thanks to the regional editor for Japan and Chairman of the Japanese Archaeological Association, Professor Dr Ichiro Yawata for kindly reading my manuscript and making valuable sugges- tions. Selection of the reports from AJ to be included in this section was also made in co-operation with Professor Dr Yawata. Owing to the preliminary nature of these reports clarification of doubtful passages must await their publication in full. A brief note dealing with the significance of the site and a few items of recommended literature are appended where necessary. Acutely conscious of the severe shortcomings of the present section on Japan, we nevertheless hope that it may prove a stepping-stone towards an improvement of this section in the future. 2. The Yayoi Period Yayoi is the name given to the period of Japanese prehistory when Yayoi pottery (cf. following Section 3) was in use. Chronologically it succeeds Jõmon S1Ä and precedes the Burial-mound Period "í-íÃKfft. It spans roughly five centuries, from the 2nd century b.c. to the 3rd century A.D. The term Yayoi is taken from a site appellation in Tõkyõ, Bunkyõ Ward, Yayoi-chõ where, following an investigation in 1884, the existence of a pottery tradition distinctive from either Jõmon or Haji ±Ê® (cf. p. 42), was first recognized. Three important cultural innovations are attributed to this period. * Mizuno Seiichi and Kobayashi Yukio (ed. 1959), Kõkogaku Jiten, Tõkyõ. Fujita Ryõsaku (ed. 1962).

Although agriculture in the form of cultivation of root crops and cereals (millet) was already practised in the later phases of the Jõmon period, it was the introduction of rice cultivation at the beginning of the period under discussion which brought about transformation into an agrarian ecology. b. Roughly contemporaneous with the beginning of rice cultivation is the introduction of metal (bronze and iron) from the Asiatic continent. c. Abundant imported ware, cultural parallels on both shores of the China Sea and artifacts clearly due to cultural stimuli from abroad testify with absolute certainty to frequent intercourse with Korea and China. Concerning the origin and first appearance of this configuration in Northern Kyüshü the following arguments are put forth: i. Northern Kyüshü in the latest phase of its Jõmon period was under strong cultural radiation from the continent. Yayoi is therefore the result of Korean cultural stimuli on the heterogeneous local Jõmon scene. Because the cultural inventory of the latest Jõmon and earliest Yayoi phases is in some instances difficult to distinguish, a transitional stage leading to a local formation of the Yayoi type culture is suggested. it . Yayoi is a cultural phase developed on the continent and brought into Japan by one or several waves of immigrants. Chronological compatibility of cultural parallels on both sides of the straits, and the fact that weapons are the first metal implements introduced, are advanced to support this argument. Since both hypotheses consider radiation from Korea as decisive in the formation of the cultural types of this phase of Japanese prehistory, they are not mutually exclusive; they merely stress different aspects. The cultivation of wet rice being the mainstay of the economy, settlements in the Yayoi Period are generally found on upland terraces, elevations above marshlands and near water sources needed for irrigation. As indicated by the index site Toro üÉS in Shizuoka prefecture fPfSiSS, the sizes of the rectangular paddy-fields tended to vary between 1 5 and 20 acres towards the end of the middle Yayoi phase. Agricultural implements were hoes and spades made of hard wood (oakwood) and a harvesting knife of polished or, in certain regions, chipped stone. Rice was reaped and stored in the ear. Granaries frequently stood on piles, with rat-guards near their upper ends. A notched tree-trunk served for ladder. Hulling was done in a wooden mortar with a long, wood pestle. Rice was apparently cooked in earthen pots. Hunting and fishing survived from earlier periods as subsidiary means of subsistence. Bows were made of wood, lacquered, or bound with cherry-tree bark. The arrow-heads were usually polished or chipped stone, occasionally also imported bronze. Imported iron single-edged swords are known, but the main weapons are imported double-edged bronze swords, lances, halberds and daggers. Stone imitations of these weapons are abundant. Spear and halberd points are either chipped or polished stone, or, infrequently, imported bronze points, all fitted with long sockets. Ring and star-shaped clubheads complete the armoury. A very primitive, composite wooden loom and the cultivation of fibrous plants seem to be contemporaneous with the introduction of rice cultivation. Judging by the incidence of cloth impressions on pottery surfaces in different areas, the use of</page><page sequence="5">28 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES S, 1 964 the loom, not yet known in Jõmon times, must have spread fairly rapidly. Body adornments were necklaces, armlets, etc. Stone beads of different types ( magatama = comma-shaped, kudatama f Ï = tubular) as well as glass beads and glass armlets are found, the latter imported as raw material or finished product. Armlets were originally made of shell. They were not the simple bivalvia armlets of Jõmon times, but were cut out from shell species like Pugilina (hemafusus) ternatana (Gmelin) for men, turritellae for women and Cellana nigris quamata (Reeve) for children. Bronze armlets imitative of turritella armlets and finger rings made of small turritellae or bronze are sometimes found. Armlets and combs made of lacquered wood, similar to those found in the latest Jõmon phase, survived into this period. Very small beads, sometimes of shell, presumably for fastening clothes, are occasionally found. Dwellings have a round ground-plan or are rectangular with rounded corners. Pit dwellings are frequently found on high ground, but not in swampy areas like Toro. In the latter case, the floor of the house is either level with or higher up above the surrounding ground. The house is often enclosed in a ring-shaped earth wall, streng- thened with palisades, or an earthen wall and a ditch. Judging by illustrations en- graved on dõtaku ffl (bronze bells), the houses were gabled and the ridge-pole held in position laterally by two posts rammed into the ground. Some pits have a diameter of only one metre and are therefore considered to have been used for storage. Sites like Hie it® in Fukuoka prefecture ffilfääiSS suggest that several rectangular enclosures of about 30 by 33 metres, surrounded by a ditch and containing a com- pound of several pit dwellings and a well, made up a settlement which in turn was surrounded by a ditch. A communal burial-ground is usually found on the edge of the settlement. Simple and multiple disposal methods of the dead were practised and interment types display a confusing variety. As they are occasionally found in the same stratigraphical horizon, it would appear that certain persons received special consideration in the community. As to the simple disposal method, we find interment of the extended body (? in wooden coffins), pits, subterranean stone cists, stone-lined pits and also in extended or flexed position in jars (Fig. 2). (The term 'urn burial' we reserve for cremated relics.) Infants or embryos are mostly found buried in the Yayoi type of utility ware. Besides the above methods of disposal, Fig. 2. Diagrams of various types of composite burial-jars. ( See Pl. Va) Sekai kõkogaku daikei , Nihon Z ' 24-25.</page><page sequence="6">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 29 unmarked on the land surface, we also know of tomb structures like dolmens, cairns and menhirs. Funeral furniture, often of imported bronze objects, is frequently discovered in the pit or jar, or in the ground nearby. A further remarkable custom of this period is the joint interment of collections of pottery or bronze implements (mostly weapons and mirrors) at certain locations on mountain slopes overlooking the settlement, or under big natural rock formations. It has been suggested that all metal implements and ritual pottery belonging to a community were normally buried at designated sacred sites and only taken out on special occasions. The centre of imported bronze implements, with preponderance of weapons in the earliest layers, lies in North Kyüshü. In other areas their presence seems to decrease in relation to the distance from this dispersal centre. One explanation why little imported ware is found in remote areas is that the metal was melted down to make dõtaku and mirrors. 3. Yayoi Pottery Contrary to previously held opinions, Yayoi pottery is now understood to have been manufactured by ring-building and not on a potter's wheel. Sutures can be clearly recognized, while surface treatment like scratching, finger-grooving and other methods of striation may have served to smooth the joints. Apart from a few very late vessels from the Kinki SSI area, no trace of the potter's wheel is found, although the use of a single turning table seems probable from the direction of certain comb-impressed decorations. In the initial stages the paste with pronounced sand tempering does not greatly vary from that of the latest Jõmon ware. Tempering tends to diminish with the passage of time, but local and functional differences have also to be allowed for. The pottery is fired to a red-brown colour at higher temperatures (850o) than the preceding late Jõmon ware, but we have no evidence of special kilns. Prominent vessel forms are jars and bottles, pots, footed dishes and bowls. They tend to appear in sets and may as such have answered all functional and ritual needs of the period (Figs. 3-5). Jars i I used as containers for storage purposes are of a richly varied type. Basic forms are bulky, semi-spherical or globular vessels with a narrow, high neck, fre- quently funnel-shaped, a narrow mouth and an out-turned or flaring mouth rim. Frequent variations are cylindrical containers with wide or narrow necks, pitchers with handles, spouted vessels, truncated and gourd-shaped jars. Jars tend to be richly decorated, plain zones of the outer surface being highly burnished. Pots SS for cooking purposes are globular or sub-globular vessels with wide mouths, often fitted with lids of slightly bigger diameter. Their variations in form are slight and rare, and their finish is comparatively rough. Great variations of size can be noticed, but all pots associated with dwelling sites have a diameter of between 20 and 30 centimetres ; their height was also fairly uniform. The base of the pots is usually burnt red and sooty on the outside, while scorched particles of food (often rice) adhere to the inner surface. Pots of this same type, but without traces</page><page sequence="7">30 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 5, 1 964 Fig. 3. Yayoi Pottery. Early and Middle Periods.

Footed dishes BS show considerable variations in the height and basal breadth of their feet and inner depth - this may be attributed to different phases, or distribu- tion areas. These vessels, which are rarely as highly decorated as the jars, are usually burnished. Due to their fragility, footed dishes are rarely found whole when compared to other types of vessels. Bowls šķ are usually of the large-mouthed variety. Local and chronological differences of form can be recognized. Most bowls are burnished, or decorated and burnished. Some have small handles and others are footed to resemble goblets. Small earthen hand-warmers '} C of a tyPe m use to this day, are to be found since the beginning of the late Yayoi phase. Decoration techniques usually create a striated effect by finger-grooving, surface scratching by various implements, incising by bivalvia shells or combs, cord- impressing and appliqué. Ochre painting is also often found. On a single vessel these decoration techniques are either used singly, or combined, or in alternation with plain zones. (Originally plain or subsequently planed by a spatula.) Decorations arranged in horizontal zones are therefore a prominent feature of surface treatment. Different decorative styles can be distinguished for three geographical areas in which Yayoi pottery occurs. Since they coincide with differences in style of the latest Jõmon phases it appears that the artistic traditions of this period lingered on into Yayoi times, and created these zonal differences. Zone i : Kyûshû shows relative paucity of decoration and decorative motifs (mostly linear), but not of techniques. Zone 2 : East Japan is distinguished by a decorative wealth, degenerating into hypertrophy in many cases, while Zone j: The Kinki area occupies a medial position. The initial phase of Early Yayoi may be termed a time of technical and artistic innovations, partly inexpertly executed, and their consolidation. Middle Yayoi shows a peak of expansion and variability and towards its last phases, the beginnings of a decline. Late Yayoi is comparatively uneventful, tending to alternate between exaggeration of form and decoration and further deterioration in quality. 4. Yayoi Ware in Kyüshü Early types of Yayoi ware occur only in those areas of northern Kyüshü nearest to the Korean peninsula. Derivation of the early Ongagawa type pottery StïïJIIÂ from Korean comb-pattern pottery has been suggested by several scholars already in the i93o's. East Kyüshü, Chūgoku and the Kinki area come into the Yayoi period in the sub- sequent typological and chronological phase, and South Kyüshü even later. The paste of the earliest ware is strongly tempered with sand, the colour of the vessels a dark grey or brown. Jars of this early type have a very roomy globular body, stable bases and a short, broad neck with out-turned mouth rim. The</page><page sequence="11">34 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 8, 1964 shoulder of the vessel is fairly pronounced and often decorated by zones of incised hatchings and cross-hatchings, set off from the undecorated, but burnished, parts by parallel horizontal lines. The body at its widest is another area of decoration. Ochre painting is sometimes seen on the inside of the rim or shoulder zone. Pots are frequently bucket-shaped and have a flaring rim. Decoration is usually limited to surface scratching and notching of the mouth rim. Footed dishes have rather deep dishes ; the border between dish and foot is marked by carinations. The surface of the vessel is usually burnished. Bowls are deeply truncated, or basin-shaped and roughly finished. Amongst the index types distinguished within the early Yayoi phase of Kyûshû, Yusu R0Ã appears to combine latest Jõmon and early Yayoi traditions. While paste, degree of firing, technique of manufacture, decorative techniques and choice of motifs are identical with the Itazuke type (see Fig. 5), vessel forms are entirely different. In time the widest part of the body of jars tends to shift upwards giving the vessel a somewhat top-heavy appearance. There is a noticeable transition of the mouth rim from flaring to out-turned and horizontally folded forms. The neck is prolonged so that the vessel becomes bottle-shaped. Decorations, which tend to cover the whole outer surface of the vessel, consist of surface scratching, shell incision, etc., even the mouth rim receives the artisťs special attention. Middle Yayoi paste appears well chosen and prepared; the colour is red-brown or yellowish-brown. The execution and finish of the ware are so skilful and uniform that it may be ascribed to professional potters. In jars, the narrowing of the base, the horizontally-folded mouth rims and trend to bottle shapes are pronounced, while pots tends to become angular. The footed dishes have very high and hollow feet and their bases show variations in form. Body and neck in all vessel types are set at a distinct angle to each other. In surface decoration the scratching and shell incising have given way to carination {suku ŽR3&amp;Ā). Painting and burnishing are still popular. Beginning with the end of the preceding phase, we find vessels of considerable size, over one metre in height, serving as burial jars; their distribution is limited to North Kyûshû. Markedly inferior workmanship sets in towards the end of the middle phase. There is a noticeable tendency to further elongation of the vessel's proportions. Inferior workmanship gets more pronounced in the late Yayoi phase. Jars and pots have egg-shaped bodies, disproportionately long necks and very unstable bases. The carination of their surface gives way to comb-incised motifs like multiple wavy lines, fan and related motifs, either over the whole surface or in certain parts of the vessel. From the end of the middle Yayoi phase local specializations and local colour be- come distinguishable. An example is the Osumi ýz PH Ä type of South Kyûshû, with pronounced and multiple carinations, a hypertrophic development of the Sugu type. In the late Yayoi phase the south of Kumamoto prefecture specializes in combed and curvilinear motifs. The Satsuma type If Ä (South Kyûshû), a very thick pottery with broad, punctated appliqués, usually quoted in this connection, is now known to have been post-Yayoi.</page><page sequence="12">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 35 5. The Burial-mound Period The Burial-mound Period succeeds the Yayoi Period and leads into historic times. It covers the 4th~7th centuries A.D. Due to the great diversity, cultural dif- ferentiation and sophistication which are characteristic of this period, no agreement has been reached so far on its subdivisions into phases ; mainly because of the many different principles of the classifications put forth. However, three phases: Early Phase (4th century), Middle Phase (5th century) and Late Phase (7th century) should prove generally acceptable. Various theories about the emergence of this period have been advanced, but it is generally agreed that the momentous innovations of the Yayoi Period - rice cultivation and introduction of metals - gradually brought about a surplus economy which, in turn, gave rise to very powerful families. They gradually consolidated their positions by gaining control of the distribution of the quality goods imported and, later on, of the raw material needed for domestic production, while getting craftsmen from the continent. Judging by the funeral furniture of the heads of these families (who wielded absolute power) there was a gradual change in their status. At first they combined ritual with political leadership, later they delegated their religious functions to others. The funeral objects found in the burial mounds are of very much higher quality than those of the Yayoi Period. This points to a sharp sociological stratification of the population between powerful families and the masses, the living conditions of the latter differing little from those of their Yayoi ancestors. There is no agreement regarding the origin of the burial mounds. Some authorities trace their evolution from the simple, small mounds indicating Yayoi burials in some areas. Others think that their emergence is connected with the rise of powerful families, i.e., ritual and political leadership became concentrated in certain families who perpetuated their high status in monumental tomb structures. Both theories fail to take into account an obvious affinity with the burial mounds of Korea. Early Phase . The religious leadership exercised by the heads of the most powerful families (who alone qualified for interment in the burial mounds) was preserved. Funeral furniture, apart from Han M and Wei ÎS mirrors, armlets, pendants and beads, staffs of authority and precious, three-legged and covered vessels for ritual ceremonies are evidence of this. There is a notable concentration of these mirrors and of jasper, widely used instead of the rare jade, in the Kinai SÈ ft area. What is also obvious is the presence of foreign and local craftsmen like tamatsukuribe 3Lfppß (bead-makers' guild) and kagamitsukuribe itfř ® (mirror-makers' guild), etc., at the seats of powerful families. Although we have no detailed knowledge of iron-working processes, the distribution of iron ore (imported from South Korea or locally won from iron grain) was in the hands of a central agency which thereby came to power. Smithery was done by hammering, for smelting was not yet known. An advanced technique of forging is seen in the presence of beautiful long swords. The traditions of the Kara kanuchi US (Korean smith) and Y amato kanuchi (Yamato smith) are preserved in some outlying areas to this day. Among iron objects, weapons outnumber all other implements and,</page><page sequence="13">36 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 8 , 1 964 judging by their quantities in some burial mounds, the great families had large arsenals of weapons. Defensive weapons like armour and helmets, which appeared towards the end of this phase, are far less sophisticated than the weapons of attack. Armour consisted of small iron plates joined by strips of leather. The other iron implements were hoe-blades, sickle-blades, hatchets, axes, adzes, chisels, awls and knives. Japanese archaeologists believe that these tools, although found as funeral furniture in burial mounds, do not signify that the chiefs led the everyday life of a peasant, but rather that they constituted part of their ritual para- phernalia. Pottery (the so-called red haji ware) is considered to be but an improved Yayoi technique. Haniwa clay figurines of houses, implements, animals and men, so revealing of the culture of the period, show astounding expressiveness and artistic refinement, although technically they are produced in the same way as Haji pottery. Middle Phase . The transition from ritual to political and military leadership took place during this phase. Heirlooms and treasures tend to disappear from the burial mounds and are replaced by imitations made of soapstone. This development puts at least imitation treasures within the reach of a broader segment within the ruler class, although genuine treasures (made of precious metals) are still the prerogative of the chieftains themselves. Gold diadems, earrings, belt buckles, gold inlay for armour, helmets, swords and horse trappings and, judging by contemporary haniwa , a new style of clothing, swept the burial-mound chiefs headlong into a wave of imitating the 'golden' rulers of Korea. So overwhelming was this urge to enhance one's prestige by possession of gold and silver ornaments that there is even a con- siderable incidence of faked gold ornaments (a copper core gilded). The smithing and fashioning of genuine gold and silver ornaments was entirely done by Korean craftsmen. There is a political background to this wave of 'Koreanism', An expeditionary force from Japan under Yamato set out to conquer the small kingdom of Mimana at the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, and to turn it into a base for further undertakings. By assisting Silla ff M and Pek'che UÄ against Koguryo flb^JÄS, the expeditionary forces sought to control war-torn Korea. They collected tribute in kind and technicians and introduced to Japan continental skills and customs on a scale unheard of and unfeasible in previous periods. Horses, which had had to be imported and were so precious that they were only owned by the mightiest, became plentiful after the Korean campaign where many cavalry engagements had been fought. Showy breeds of prestige value, with fancy trappings, were abandoned in favour of strong war-horses. Riveted armour, too cumbrous for mounted troops, was replaced by scale armour of the continental type. Archery was improved to dis- charge powerful projectiles: it replaced hand fighting with its large, gashing sword cuts. Burial-mound pottery now changes to Sue MM ware (Fig. 6), an offshoot of the wheel-produced and highly fired Silla kiln pottery. Weaving technique and embroidery made notable advances. Damask and brocade were much in demand by the great ones. These leading families had by now become so powerful that they imported Korean technicians and engineers in great</page><page sequence="14">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 37 numbers and settled them near their own seats; they also mobilized large labour forces to construct many huge burial mounds. Smaller local chiefs imitated the mightiest on a scale commensurate with their means. Towards the end of this phase the supremacy of the Tennõ family was already uncontested, but fierce struggles for power were fought among the great chiefs of the next rank. Late Phase. A further change in the political structure is indicated in this last phase by the appearance of groups of burial mounds "Ě" ÍÍ . Although the interven- tion in Korea failed in its immediate objective, the Japanese realized how backward their political organization was when compared to that of the Korean states. The Chinese official system, which had long been operating there, they now hurried to adopt. Koreans scribes were enlisted to keep their records. In short, the hierarchy of high and petty officials is now laid to rest in the burial mounds ; rank is expressed by the magnificence (not necessarily the size) of the structure and the wealth of funeral furniture. At first only the mightiest lords had a burial mound. After the reform officials were also buried in such structures. The horizontal stone-chamber ffi/CSlSlÊ (which had reached North Kyüshü by the end of the 5th century, but had not spread widely until the later phase because it demanded superior skills) revolutionized burial mound building. Once the new technique was mastered, burial Fig. 6. Sue Ware from Hirosawa burial mound. See page 62. mounds proved easier and less costly to construct, because they could now be used as lineage tombs. In the late phase the changes began thus to reach down to a somewhat broader segment of the population. Cattle and horses were bred locally, although in small numbers and never for use in agriculture. Although the period saw the beginning of angle construction in architecture, the masses still lived mostly in pit dwellings and haji was the utility pottery throughout. Jasper for ornaments was limited to the areas where it was found; agate, crystal and glass replaced it elsewhere. Silver and gold ornaments achieve high technical and artistic sophistication and, gradually, acquire a Japanese flavour. This development is also noticeable in Sue ware and other aspects of contemporary material culture, anticipating the political unification and emergence of Japan as a state.</page><page sequence="15">38 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 8, 1 964 6. Burial Mounds T&amp;tS Breaking with terminological usage, which takes the presence or absence of pottery, and its character, as the determinant factor in designating the earlier periods, the period now discussed is named after its characteristic tomb structures. Japanese burial mounds are made of earth or of stones. On the basis of their ground plan three main types, round, square and keyhole-shaped, are recognized (Fig- 7)- Round mounds ñ ÍŠ , which are the most fundamental type, have a round ground plan and are built up to a truncated cone (early and middle phase) or a cone (late phase). Small mounds of this type can also be found in the Yayoi Period. In the Burial-mound Period it occurs in various sizes, but rarely exceeds 100 metres in diameter. Square mounds JjiŘ are built up to a pyramid or truncated pyramid over a square base. The sides usually slope, meeting at an apex; stepped or terraced varieties are rare in Japan. Square mounds were built after the 4th century, but flourish in the 7th century. Later square mounds are orientated to the four cardinal points, the stone chamber facing due south. Beginning with Emperor Yomei ffi (a.D. 586-587) many emperors were buried in this type of tomb. It may be advisable to change the Japanese term 'square mound' to the more familiar pyramid, stepped pyramid, or pyramidal tomb, in international usage. Fig. 7.

Sketch by Ichirõ Yazvata.</page><page sequence="16">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 39 Keyhole-shaped mounds M ÍF íâ R Ä are the most characteristic Japanese type. In Japanese terminology they are called 'front square rear round' (zenpokoen), a curiously inappropriate description since the 'round rear* is the most important part of the structure, containing the chamber and the entrance, thus really represen- ting the front. The basic type of the keyhole-shaped burial mounds consists of a round mound and a square annex. Chronological and local differences in the relative sizes of front and rear parts have been recognized (Plate I a). Keyhole-shaped mounds of the early phase often make use of a natural hillock as a lean-to. To the mound a low square terrace is added, making the ground plan comparable in shape to a keyhole. Originally the tomb zone was apparently not marked off from the surrounding area by a moat. Towards the middle phase of the period, the base end of the square annex is widened considerably and its height increased to almost that of the round mound. (Henceforth the term 'mound' will denote the round part of the structure, whereas the whole tomb will be called 'burial-mound'.) From both apexes it slopes to a lower terrace at the foot of the mound where the square projections on one or both sides are another innovation. Keyhole-shaped burial mounds of this phase are generally found on upland terraces or in plains and are surrounded by moats. In the late phase the square annex has outgrown the mound in size, a develop- ment due to the use of a new type of stone chamber which restricts the size of the mound to a certain limit. Construction of very large mounds was, in general, discontinued in the late phase. The peculiar shape of these structures and their size excited early interest and gave rise to different theories concerning their origin. Some authorities think they are meant to imitate the outline of an ox-drawn cart, hence 'cart-mounds' MM, others say they are merely the result of contact between two different mound- building traditions. It has also been suggested that the apex of a natural hill was used for the mound and the rest of the mountain cut away, leaving only a square projection. Recently the theory in favour is that this type originated when a per- manent square platform was built to replace the temporary one on which the funerary rites were performed. Prestige demanded its ever-increasing size and it became merely ornamental, since the rites were conducted on the bank of the moat. Within this general type the following important subtypes are recognized: a. the round mound is replaced by a square mound (front square, rear square mfiíííáífíS); b. two square annexes are attached to a central round mound MJj cf H S ; c. the square annex is somewhat shorter than in regular keyhole-shaped mounds (scallop WÄ JIÂííÂ). It has been suggested that this is possibly a fore- runner of the regular type, but all instances known to date belong to the middle phase. Representative specimens have a mound diameter of 100 metres. The criteria leading to this classification are somewhat arbitrary. Since transition types are frequent, exact identification of a given burial mound as to subtype is often difficult and controversial. The mound is very often erected over a chamber which, in Japan, is made of stone. Mounds built over stone coffins or sarcophagi (outer stone coffins used as receptacles for inner coffins) are also known.</page><page sequence="17">40 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 8&gt; 1 964 With chambers, structural differences transcend building materials and form a more reliable criterion for classification than building materials. Accordingly Japanese terminology distinguishes vertical and horizontal chambers. Vertical chambers H/CÄSÜ are named thus because they are built into the summit of a mound in such a way that the four walls are put in first (in many cases built round a coffin, let down into a pit, or deposed on a hard dirt floor) and the ceiling last. Stone chambers usually consist of andesite or quartz cut into neat slabs. In localities where such material is unavailable or the technical skills are not sufficiently advanced, rough boulders, or large river pebbles are simply piled up in dry masonry technique. Vertical chambers characterize the burial mounds of the early and middle phases. They are believed to continue the Yayoi Period's tradition of stone-lined burial pits (PL Ii). According to size three subtypes are recognized : a . length 6-8 metres breadth 1 metre height 1 metre b. 2-3 metres 0-6-0-9 metre 1 metre c. 3-6 metres 2 metres 1-2 metres Subtype a is the prevalent form in the 4th century and is found associated with a special type of wooden coffin (log type). In the 5th century it is replaced by subtype c with a stone coffin. It is not known whether a wooden coffin is connected with subtype b. The vertical stone chambers surviving into the 7th century resemble in their wall construction the horizontal chambers. Walls are often painted red and clay coffins (made of a soft Sue paste and fired) are found in certain areas. (Provinces Minasaka JS fř and Bizen ffi M of the Chūgoku area.) Horizontal stone chambers IS/tÂ5lË. This second type is thus called because it was constructed at ground level and covered with a mound. Many authorities think it was the materialization of a special concept of burying within an 'eternal house', which was supposed to replace the dwelling house owned during lifetime - this needs further substantiation. Horizontal chambers entered North Kyûshû from Korea (where they are found from early times) towards the end of the 5th century, but as they required new skills they did not spread. Another theory denies that all horizontal chambers in Japan are derived from this Korean/North Kyûshû type because there is a chronological gap and also certain constructional differences. Contrary to the vertical chamber (where the four walls are first constructed and then covered with a ceiling), here three walls and the ceiling are first constructed and last the fourth wall, representing or containing the entrance. A corridor, usually lower in height and much narrower than the chamber, leads out of the mound, the apex of which is directly over the chamber. The main chamber is either quadrangular or rectangular, but elliptical chambers are also known. The corridor may connect with the centre of the chamber wall, or be placed off-centre, or join the chamber at a right angle. In some cases an anteroom is placed between corridor and chamber; in others, a small chamber, better termed a niche, leads off the far wall of the chamber.</page><page sequence="18">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 4I Natural rocks, boulders or neatly cut slabs are the usual building materials of this type of chamber. Border cases, making clear distinction from dolmens extremely difficult, are not rare (Pl. I Iß). The floor of the chamber is of hard dirt; the first row of stones is vertically placed and dug in well below floor level. The upper layers of stone are usually piled up horizontally, each layer slightly projecting over the preceding one and creating a vaulted appearance. In addition to funeral furniture and coffins, the chambers often contain built-in stone coffin-stands and stone partitions. The corridor is closed towards the outside by a pile of boulders, a fitted slab, or even a wooden door. Coffins. The predominant types found during this period fall into several cate- gories. a . Split-bamboo type wooden coffin iFJWÄTfcfjl (log-shaped may be a more familiar description). It is hollowed out of the large trunk of an umbrella pine ( Scyadopitis verticillata ), split in half lengthwise, the top half serving as lid. This type is found during all phases of the Burial-mound Period, but is relatively rare after the 6th century (PI. Hi). b. Spit-bamboo stone coffin #J Vi Ã S fil . A cylindrical stone coffin of somewhat unstable appearance, since both halves have a semicircular cross-section. In some coffins of this type a stone or wooden pillow is found. Both short sides have stone protuberances. The typological position and relationship of this variety to other types are con- troversial, since it is, on the one hand, considered to be a forerunner of the boat- shaped type, from which some specimens are very hard to distinguish, and on the other hand, it is pronounced to be a translation into stone of the wooden type above. The relations between this wooden type and the boat-shaped variety are also disputed. c. Boat-shaped stone coffin ÂMEfê. What distinguishes it from b is a somewhat compressed, sub-semicircular cross-section. It was in use from the latter half of the early to the middle phases. The sides of the lid slope upwards to a narrow central ridge and both lid ends are usually flattened. Protuberances, which may have served to lash together both halves of the coffin, or to suspend it for transport, are found on the short sides and sometimes on the long sides (PL Ilia). d. Oblong-chest stone coffin SfêÃSft. This composite, fitted coffin appeared during the middle phase of the Burial-mound Period. It consists of a bottom slab, four walls and a lid. The parts are fitted together by grooves hollowed out near the edge of each slab. Its shorter sides are thereby inserted between the long sides. The long sides are also provided with one or two protuberances. The central ridge of the lid is somewhat elevated. The type is thought to imitate a certain Chinese type of coffin. In Japan it is usually found in association with vertical stone cham- bers, but sometimes also merely interred (Pl. III6). e . House-type stone or wood coffin Its lid is roof-shaped. It is occasionally found in the middle phase, but is predominantly associated with late burial mounds. This type tends to have a gradually broadening central ridge. The</page><page sequence="19">4 2 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES S, 1964 lid assumes thereby a trapezoidal cross-section. On some of the lids as many as six protuberances have been noted. The coffin part may consist of a composite cist - as type d - or may be hollowed out. The protuberances in this type are limited to the lid; in later specimens they are even omitted (Pl. IV0). A subtype of this variety (IS P ÃEfè) has a large opening at one short or long wall, to allow entry without raising the lid. The opening is designed to allow post- funeral inspection of the body without the lid having to be raised ; it is closed by a single or a double door. This subtype is found after the middle of the 5th century, in North Kyushü. /. Cloth coffin 2*5 #ř ft , which did not enter Japan before the 7th century, consists of layers of hemp cloth lacquered together. A representative specimen with 35 layers of cloth is lacquered black on the outside and cinnabar red on the inside. Its dimensions are length 26 metres and breadth 0*65 metres. gv Clay coffins in Japan belong to the late Burial-mound Period and are in their distribution mainly limited to the Kinki and Chūgoku areas. Their making has already been described above. Turtle-back coffins and roof-shaped coffins are known. There are numerous specimens painted red on the outside and likewise decorated with carved horses and human figures (PI. IVi). Funeral furniture in the early phase is usually limited to personal effects and ritual paraphernalia, placed in the majority of cases outside the coffin. Where a vertical stone chamber is used, funeral furniture is placed within the chamber, but outside the coffin. Overflow is neatly arranged outside the chamber. Gradually a change takes place and the number of the objects placed in the coffin increases. Many coffins have an inner partition marking off the space for funeral furniture. Objects of lesser importance, or those used for funeral or post-funeral rites, are left outside. Where a horizontal chamber is used, enough space for orderly arrange- ment of the funeral furniture is provided. To sum up, in the early burial-phase a split-bamboo type coffin was deposed on the clay floor and a vertical stone chamber built around it and into the mound. In some later cases the stone chamber is omitted and the coffin merely coated with clay. A further change is the use of stone instead of wood for coffins of this type, or the boat-shaped variety. The oblong chest-type coffin is representative of the middle phase, the house-type coffin which is contemporary with it, is somewhat rare. The coffin types of the late phase are either wood or stone-house types. In some cases coffins were omitted and the bodies merely deposed in the chamber. 7. Haji Pottery Haji is a type of pottery made in the Yayoi tradition, but used as utility ware throughout the Burial-mound Period to Nara ^ A (a.D. 710-782) and Heian (a.D. 794-1192) times. The name haji is of considerable age, being first mentioned in the Nihonshoki 0 (a.D. 720) in connection with the dynasty of royal court potters Nie no hajibe S ± M , a professional class whose traditional skills remained within the family or adopted descendants.</page><page sequence="20">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 43 In archaeological usage both Yayoi and Haji wares were originally termed Yayoi or hanibe $1 and even today the exact distinction of one from the other remains controversial. Some scholars consider small, round-bottomed vessels to be the first type of Haji pottery, while others insist that contemporaneity and association with burial mounds are more suitable criteria. The paste of Haji pottery is very smooth and has in many cases been obviously levitated in water to wash out coarse particles. The manufacturing process, colour and firing (method and temperature) are identical with those of Yayoi proper. Prevalent pottery forms are : pots, small bowls, goblets, footed dishes, crucibles, rice-steamers, cauldrons, footed stands, pottery ovens, etc. - mainly vessels for cooking or steaming cereals (PL Vc). Haji ware was used in this function long after the introduction of the technically superior Sue pottery, and attests to a remark- able conservatism in dietary habits. Decoration is practically absent from this ware. Haji is found today all over Japan in such uniformity that it is almost impossible to name a given vessel by its area of origin. The only exception is Haji ware from Tottori prefecture ÄBklS which is well decorated and therefore immediately identifiable. To explain this uniformity, it is said that this pottery originated with, or was made by or under the supervision of the Hajibe court-potter dynasty and that it constituted a kind of currency or tribute. The Hajibe were really the core of a potter's guild, according to an ancient record ( Engishi SSlfÄ A.D. 927). Other contemporary records give an interesting detail that pottery was made by women. 8. Sue Pottery Ä §1 This type was produced in Japan after the second half of the Burial-mound Period by immigrant Korean potters. It is an offshoot of Silla because of its hard- ness and impermeability. The appellation 'porcelain' is, of course, not justified technically. During the Meiji Kfè period (a.D. 1868-1912) academic tradition sub- divided this pottery into Korean and Iwaibe ware. Accordingly Korean ware S3 Ä SS was pottery with visible traces of the potter's wheel on its interior surface ; vessels were usually large and for general use. Iwaibe K had no visible traces of the potter's wheel on the inside and the term was applied to small vessels, or ware for ritual use. Later it was realized that this distinction into two types was superfluous, although it is still maintained by some scholars. To complete the terminological confusion, some authorities assert that the whole tradition ought to be called Iwaibe, while others advocate the term Sue for it - the name favoured by a majority. Sue ware has a smooth paste and is fashioned on a potter's wheel and fired in a tunnel-kiln (tube-shaped sloping kiln) capable of producing intense heat to over 10000; it has a grey or dark grey colour and considerable hardness. It may have been introduced from China; others say it originated in South Korea (it is not found in North Korea). This new type of kiln makes possible the manufacture of a superior type of pottery like the Silla pottery in Korea and its Japanese offshoot. In Japan it appears largely as ritual and funerary ware, although most of its pre- dominant forms are functional.</page><page sequence="21">44 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES S, 1 964 Mounted bowls with covers W âËffi ff (S) are most frequent. The cup or shallow bowl is supported on a slender conical foot which is either solid or perforated with round or triangular openings. These vents allowed the hot air to escape and not crack the vessel in the firing. The cover is supported by a narrow ridge running around the vessel below the rim (earlier form), or a ridge attached to the cover (later). The cover has one central, or several off-centre knobs which may be solid or perforated, conical, or of various other shapes. Judging by the Korean find material, where remains of solid food are often found sticking to these vessels, they were used for solid food, and not for drinking. Mounted cups without covers were, on the contrary, drinking cups. There are other cups with or without cover, but without a foot. Sometimes a horn-shaped handle is attached. Jars have a globular body and V-shaped neck. The base is either round, or, in later vessels, slightly dented. This footless jar was probably used either for storing food or carrying water; similar forms are still in use for these purposes in Korea to this day. A separate pottery stand ti n* for these jars is another frequent type; some jars are fitted with an attached foot. Some jars of this type have a round hole in the globular part of their body and were presumably used for holding fluids, the hole being plugged with a bamboo peg. The theory that this variety served as a musical instrument by blowing air across the hole is rather discredited. One variety of jar has a trumpet-shaped neck, and another an almost cylindrical neck. Flattened flasks are of a typologically related shape. Amongst pottery stands two varieties are observed. One is a tall, hollow conical stand with a shallow bowl to receive the round-bottomed jars (PL Vi); the other a large, deep basin on a tall stand which may have served another function. Stands with a narrow base are considered early. We also find zoomorphic vessels with clay figurines (zoomorphic, anthropomorphic or utensil-shaped), luted to the shoulder of the vessel or its cover. To round up the inventory there are very big jars (height and diameter exceeding one metre) and a variety with the axes of the body bent at an angle to the neck. Decorations are slant-lattice, herring-bone, bands of inverted triangular designs, dotted lines, concentric circles, squares filled with vertical lines, zig-zag bands, etc., all incised in the feet of mounted vessels, on covers, at the waist of jars and below the mouth rim of footed bowls or cups. Furthermore, carinating and applied bands, sometimes in turn decorated by punctations and incisions, and applied clay figurines, are other decorative techniques. On many vessels the beater's mark is found on both inner and outer surfaces. 9. Haniwa Haniwa are clay figurines found in association with burial mounds. Archaeological usage makes a distinction between cylindrical and figurative haniwa. The latter group consists of house-shaped, utensil-shaped, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic ware. A technical characteristic common to these haniwa is that they are all hollow. The appellation haniwa in the form of hanitsuchi it appears in written records for the first time in the Nihonshoki 0 (a.d. 720). The arrangement of these</page><page sequence="22">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 45 objects in a circle enclosing a sacred ground, is said to have given them their name of Haniwa (wa= ring, circle). The lower part of the haniwa was buried in the ground. Its exposed part was frequently painted white or red. Haniwa appear to be contemporaneous with the beginning of burial mounds, but clear chronological differences exist between various types. House and utensil-shaped figurines are found in the early phase of the Burial-mound Period ; towards the end of the 4th century, bird-shaped figurines begin to appear. They are followed in the beginning of the 5th century by other zoomorphic decorations and lastly, towards the middle of that century, by anthropomorphic figurines. With different phases the pre- dominant type of figurine, and the mode of arranging them, change. The cylindrical haniwa are found in all the phases and their arrangement always follows the cir- cumference of the entire burial mound, or the base line of the mound itself. A third row of cylindrical haniwa was often inserted at middle height of the mound. After the middle phase of the Burial-mound Period when a moat was built, haniwa were also buried on its outer bank. Sometimes a separate sacred enclosure, near but outside the burial mound itself, is demarcated by cylindrical haniwa. When house- and utensil-shaped haniwa were in vogue, they were often arranged in concentric circles on the apex of the mound, inside the circle circumscribed by the cylindrical variety. Lids and shields (utensil variety) were frequently arranged to create some pattern. When zoomorphic and anthropomorphic haniwa appeared, they were set up on the square annex, on the banks of the moat, or in rows right and left of the entrance to the stone chamber. In some cases the entire circum- ference of the burial mound is outlined by these figurines, or, at least, the central row of cylindrical haniwa replaced by the figurative variety. The probable origin of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic haniwa was to replace the immolation of the living to be buried with a powerful lord when he died. Ancient records ( Kojiki "È* #15 a.D. 712) say that immolation was first practised at the death of Yamatotakeru no Mikoto H (legendary Japanese national hero, son of Keiko jptfr Tennõ, O Usu, who is credited with defeating the Kumaso and Ainu in A.D. 71) and that this took the form of burying living beings up to their chest or neck around the mound of the lord ( Nihonshoki , A.D. 720). According to tradition Nintoku Tennõ fcîS (a.D. 313-399), deeply distressed by the shrieks of the tortured victims, abolished the custom. At the suggestion of Nomi no Sukune SřSĚIS anthropomorphic haniwa were used in their place. This is not borne out by archaeological findings, which conclusively date this type of haniwa to after the middle of the 5th century. It is known, however, that the descendants of Nomi no Sukune built tombs for the court. Many scholars opine that this family may have originated the legend to enhance their prestige and court rank. The independent origin of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic haniwa in Japan is improbable since there existed already the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic stone figures in Han-time China and also in Korea. Clay figurines were in ritual and funerary use in China since the Yin and Chou dynasties as well as in Korea. Defenders of the independent origin theory claim that even if such influence from the continent were granted, cylindrical forms and some house- and utensil-</page><page sequence="23">46 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES S, 1 964 shaped haniwa were already in use before the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic types appeared. But this theory tells us nothing about the origin of those earlier varieties. a . Cylindrical forms RtSiSfā. The type of haniwa most frequently found are the cylindrical forms divided in turn into the ordinary cylindrical R Iti and the trumpet-shaped cylindrical (PI. VII# ). The cylindrical stem of both subtypes shows at least 3 or 4 carinations. Two or more holes are punched into the body at various places. They are either square or round, triangular or gourd-shaped. The cylindrical haniwa are very variable in size. Some specimens of the middle phase have a dia- meter of 50 to 60 centimetres. In the late phase, diameters are approximately 30 centimetres. Thick-walled haniwa are also characteristic of the late phase. In burying these haniwa, one trumpet-shaped specimen is followed by several ordinary cylindrical ones. It has been assumed that the cylindrical haniwa served to mark off a sacred enclosure (burial mound or ritual platform) from profane surroundings. The theory that cylindrical haniwa were buried around the mound to guard it against landslides is out of favour. b . Houses W. ^ Irci . These figurines represent (presumably) all types of wooden structures of the period with considerable realism. Houses can be distinguished by the number of window openings from mere utility buildings like granaries, storehouses and barns with only one (door) opening. Among granaries those apparently on piles are frequent. Roofs are saddle-backed (tower roof with two opposite gables and a concave upper outline). House-shaped haniwa appear from the early phase (Pl. VI). c. Utensils HWttina. Most often represented are ceremonial umbrellas as signs of rank, shields, arrow-cases, armour, ritual fans, chairs, hand-protectors (for archers), large swords, halberds, mounted cups, bowls with covers, etc. - in short the utensils carried in the procession of a powerful man when he went abroad. It follows that they were most probably destined to serve him in place of the actual utensils on his last journey into the Beyond (PI. Villi). d. Zoomorphic objects Mb % . Animals most frequently modelled are among the domestic animals: the horse, dog, ox and barn fowl (the first two species are predominant), and feral animals like boar, deer, monkey and aquatic birds. They are almost without exception portrayed stationary, though realistically. Animals in motion, or even with the head turned to one side, are rare (PI. Vili). e . Anthropomorphic objects À % ftt $&amp;. The usual division is according to posture, into standing and sitting figurines. Those standing are either modelled complete to the feet, or have an upper part superimposed on a cylindrical stand (PI. Villa). Less frequent are figures sitting cross-legged or with feet hanging down, and kneel- ing with both hands placed on the floor in the formal posture of obeisance. Both sexes are represented, men either in ordinary or formal attire, or clad in armour. Nobles in ceremonial costume are complete with coronets, long swords and other signs of rank. The occupations recognizable are falconers, musicians {koto [PI. VIIIč], and drum) and peasants with a hoe tucked into their belts. Women are usually portrayed in some ritual function like ceremonially offering ajar, or in the attire of</page><page sequence="24">JAPAN EKIKA KANEKO 47 a shaman (with shamanistic paraphernalia). One more variety are women with a child strapped to their backs. Naked figures of both sexes, sometimes with exaggerated genitals, are said to represent the common people. Anthropomorphic haniwa in motion, predominantly dancing figures, are comparatively rare. Stylistically, a division of figurines into realistic and stylized varieties can be made, the dancing figurines belonging largely to the second group. The anthropomorphic haniwa give some insight into aspects of contemporary culture which otherwise would be denied to us. However, the anthropomorphic haniwa are strictly representative only of their own phase within the Burial-mound Period (after the middle of the 5th century). From the body adornments of the early phase, known to us from actual finds, and those shown on the haniwa of the later phase, this aspect of culture seems to have known no revolutionary changes. Men of the phase represented by the haniwa wore their long hair parted in the middle and bound up at both temples. Women wore theirs either gathered and bound at the nape of the neck, or put up in a style reminiscent of the Shimada coiffure of later times. Men were dressed in upper garments resembling in style recent Japanese under- garments. Over this a long trouser-skirt, similar to the recent formal Hakama was worn. Women's upper garments were similar to men's, over them they wore a long skirt. Accessories like hats, belts, shoes, necklaces, earrings, combs, etc. are all indicated. Commonly found accessories of armour are leather hand-protectors (against the back-kick of the bow-string) and various types of arrow-cases, swords and daggers. Anthropomorphic haniwa are interspersed with house haniwa surrounding the mound, on both sides of the entrance to the stone chamber and on the outer bank of the moat. In the case of a scallop-type burial mound, they are arranged over the annex. Sometimes they are also found in groups, but are not, apparently, meant to represent some particular tableau. We still do not know how to account for fluctuations in the character, style and scope of anthropomorphic haniwa, nor whether certain types were connected with special functions, or assumed special meanings in a particular context.</page><page sequence="25">48 8 y I964 ARCHEOLOGIA JAPONICA ANNOTATED TRANSLATIONS Hyakuryõyama Site AJ , 9(1956): 98 Location : Niigata prefecture ïfrSfl, Arai town Ìt# rfr, Hyakuryõyama.

The site at a foothill of Mt Myoko has a north-south extension of 210 metres, an east- west extension of 170 metres and a height above the paddy fields at its feet of 40 metres. The plateau at its summit is 210 by 80 metres. The 47 indentations located on the plateau are suggestive of pit-dwellings. Following last year's distri- bution study of the pits, their division into northern, southern and central groups could be confirmed this year and the character of the site clarified by a number of excavations. A moat was found running the entire length of the foothill at the 20 metre mark. The site is to date the southernmost instance of the chashi types tronghold. Lot j i : Southern group. Dimensions of indented area before excavation : diameter 4 metres, depth 35 centimetres. After excavation: north-south extension: 2-70 metres, east- west extension 2-60 metres. The ground plan is square, there are no clearly identifiable postholes, although four small pits (diameter 1 5 centimetres) dug into the floor halfway between every two corners, may be postholes. Remnants of a baked-clay floor are found in the southeast part of the pit. A small ditch runs roughly parallel to the west wall of the pit at a distance of 70 centimetres. It bends to follow the south wall, but runs due north to an unknown destination. Charcoal, fragments of baked clay and pottery sherds were found in this ditch. Lot jo, 11: Northern group. Indentation is not indicative of a dwelling pit. When the excavation area was extended beyond indentation, a belt of black earth, running north-south with a width of 3*5 metres and thickness of 10 centimetres and containing numerous pottery sherds, was found. This belt slopes gradually off to the south but widens in the north, and contains many pottery sherds and charcoal. " It leads to a pit (dia. 2 metres, depth 1-2 metres) which has been numbered lot 10. The pit's floor is laid out with flat pebbles. The earth filling has three horizons, all three containing pottery sherds, charcoal and baked-clay fragments. There is no evidence of a change in the type of pottery sherds in all three horizons, suggesting that the pit was filled within a relatively short time. Lot 24 , 25: Central group. Dimensions before digging diameter 4 metres, depth 20-40 centimetres. The excavation clarified that it was not used as a pit-dwelling. Lot 6 : Far end of the northern group. Dimensions before excavation : dia. 4- 5 metres, depth 30-40 centimetres. After excavation : north-south 4-05 m., east- west 4 metres. Due to dislocation by tree roots the ground-plan cannot be reconstructed accurately. Irregularities of outline and different floor levels suggest several super- imposed dwellings. Three fireplaces were found. Pottery sherds are very small,</page><page sequence="26">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 49 but prevalent forms are found to be jars, pots, footed dishes and pottery stands. The pottery shows some relation with that of the Chigusa site ť S on Sado island and should be dated latest Yayoi or, possibly, earliest Burial-mound Period. Note : Chashi is Ainu for 'palisade' or 'stronghold' . These took advantage of natural features and are therefore to be found on isolated capes, steep river banks, cliffs above the seashore, on isolated hills, surrounded on three sides by natural barriers. Communication on the fourth side is cut off by a single, double or triple moat, whereby the earth material of the moat forms an earth wall on the interior bank which is fortified by palisades and intermittent watch-towers. If attacked, the defenders threw stones or shot arrows from the watch-towers. As these structures are thought to be closely connected with the Ainu problem, they have been the subject of many speculations. Their construction, and descrip- tions of them in ancient records, show that they were defensive strongholds ; in peace time some may have served as dwellings and ritual assembly places. Their distribution all over south Sakhalin, Hokkaido dfciSM (here alone several thousands of them are known), Chishima Ť A and North Honshū coincides with the former or present habitat of the Ainu. Most scholars are of the opinion that the chashi is not an original feature of Ainu culture, but was brought in by another ethnic group. A group very often mentioned in this connection are the Mishihase (Su-shen of Han time records or ^CÄ Jurchen) who some also consider to be the bearers of the controversial Ochotsk pottery. They seem to have lived in Northeast Manchuria during the first half of the first millenium A.D. and appear in Chinese records as pirates with an astonishingly wide range of action. According to Japanese records they raided the west coast of HonsHū during the 6th century A.D. and had an operations base on Sado Island. I have therefore thought it worthwhile to give here this particular hypothesis. But the identity of the Su-shen with the bearers of the Ochotsk pottery can be counted out, since the skeletal finds of Moyoro Sír Si*! shell-mound showed strong affinities with the Aleutians and the Eskimos of West Alaska, whereas the Su-shen must have been a Tungusic people. While the original builders of the chashi type strongholds still elude us and connection with the Ochotsk pottery complex is most doubtful, a structural and cultural relation with the Gorodišcé of Eastern Russia and Western Siberia must be noted.

It is situated on top of a low foothill (20 metres), fringing the gorge cut by the Numata river E JM, west of the railway station Mihara HJÜ on the main Sanyo ill Ws rail- way line. It was discovered when the owner of the land dug a pit for charcoal burning. The site was investigated and restored to its original state by the members of the Numata River Area Cultural Property Protection Society. The earth under the cairn had only been dug to a depth of 30 centimetres and the lower half of a decapitated jar deposed. Gaps between the pit walls and the jar were filled in with sand. A cover, fashioned from the lower half of another decapitated jar, had been put over the container, but had fallen in when discovered. The character of this jar dates it as late Yayoi. Over this jar a stone cairn made of river pebbles, diameter 3 metres, height 75 centimetres had been erected and was covered, on discovery, with a layer of 10 centimetres of eroded soil. Fig. 8. a.

This type of jar burial has strong typological and chronological affinities with the jar-burial sites of South Korea and appears to have reached Japan from there. It is believed (Kim i960: 32) that the jar burials (2nd century b.c.) predate the beginning of the Kimhae period in Korea.

The site is situated on a low sand dune (height 3-5 metres above sea level), in the coastal plain north of Shimonoseki city. A trench (3 by 20 metres) was dug directly south from the spot(?) where in 1913 two narrow bronze swords and a bronze mirror had been picked up. A second trench (4 by 5 metres) leads from the south end of T rench I to the west. In T rench I, remains of a structure and one or two early Yayoi jars were found at a depth of 1-5 metres. This deposit was followed by a sand layer of 30 centimetres covering a stone cist, or alternatively, rows of pebbles outlining a rectangular space. A burial jar covered with a pottery basin was found at the same level. Trench II yielded a stone cist and another rectangular pit constructed with pebbles. Under this were found sherds of earliest Jõmon pottery. It may be assumed that the above-mentioned stone structure was a tomb marker of some sort.

This constitutes the fifth consecutive season of research on this site since 1953. Previous studies suggested separated burial areas, depending on the sex of the deceased. Male skeletons appeared to be dominant in the eastern section of the burial area and female remains in the west. Our object this year was to confirm this impression. To this end the excavation area yielding the female skeletons was extended to the southwest and northeast. In the southwestern section 3 female and 4 male skeletons were found, the female remains left untouched after disposal, the male skeletons subjected to a second phase of disposal, which consisted in collecting the bones at a later date. The northeast section yielded 3 female and 1 1 male skeletons, one of them in a stone cist. Within this subsection the women were placed towards the west. All burials (within this section?) are orientated to the east and pebbles placed at all four corners (of the pits?). In view of our findings, it appears certain that (within this burial area?) male remains were generally placed in the eastern part, female remains in the west, although a few female and infantile skeletons are found interspersed in the sector reserved for men. A great amount of Haj i pottery, iron implements and two bronze mirrors were found above the layer of early Yayoi pottery sherds (where?). They are interpreted as evidence of post-funerary rites. Geological and geographical investigations with the object of studying the physical environment of the site during the early Yayoi period took place simul- taneously with archaeological research. Note: A different type of disposal method for men (multiple) and women (simple) at the same burial site and horizon is of great significance from the point of view of disposal method typology, if it can be proved to have been more than local usage.

This site is situated on a sandy beach near Hirota and was discovered when the high winds and waves of Typhoon No. 22 exposed a great number of human remains and shell objects. Since the sand dunes serve as wind and wave breakers</page><page sequence="30">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 53 and trees are planted there to protect the nearby paddy-fields, the research area had to be limited to small trial trenches for dwelling and burial areas. As regards the burial area, the section exposed by the typhoon was investigated (trial trench 2*io by io metres; Pl. IX). In the uppermost layer two rows of pebbles or coral blocks were found to frame seven groups of burials, each containing two or three bodies (skulls and long bones only). The long bones were deposed in a position corresponding to that in the body and the skulls placed collectively at both ends (of the frame?). Deer bones were found mixed up with human remains. Shell rings were still affixed to arm and thigh bones (Pl. X6) and there were great numbers of shell beads and carved shell pendants. The next layer contained burnt bones, shell beads and other shell ornaments in areas directly under every group of burials in the above layer. This was a multiple disposal, in the second phase of which the long bones and skull were gathered and the rest burnt. The third layer again contained burials: coral blocks and pebbles surround the body(ies?) In this layer the skull is placed on top of the long bones or, alternatively, two bodies are laid to rest skull to skull. Under this is a layer of remains of infants, terminated towards the following layer by a deposit of wreath shells. Infant remains are also found amongst the shell deposit. This layer is followed by a layer containing flexed burials and collected remains as above. This layer is close to bedrock. The shell ornaments found in great numbers with these burials differ in form according to the phase of disposal they are associated with. Pendants and other perfor- ated shell ornaments (carved ťao-ťieh 31 H patterns and small comma-shaped dragon pendants) (PL Xa ) are limited to burials of the first phase or a simple disposal method. Shell beads and rings are, however, found in great numbers on all burials. The investigators opine that the small beads imitate an old Chinese custom of Ts'in M and Han times [i.e. placing beads about a deceased, since they were credited with powers to preserve the body against decomposition and assure resurrection - Translator ]. Likewise the pendants, as described above, conform in style and function to Chinese models. {T'ao-t'ieh pattern known from Lungshan and Yangshao cultures where they appear to have had ritual significance; in the Yin and Chou times they were secularized to a purely ornamental function). The type of disposal conforms to practices of the southern islands, but the funeral furniture is Chinese, apparently directly dispersed from a coastal area of South China. A trial trench (2 by 4 metres) into the supposed dwelling area had to be abandoned when it collapsed. Stratification is uncertain, but Sugu- type sherds (see Figs 3 and 4, and page 34, Yayoi ware in Kyûshû) and pottery sherds akin to those found in the southern islands(?) at a later period(?) were recovered. A second trench was dug into the exposed area, facing the sea. A stratification of three layers of sand mixed up with shell particles was exposed. They contain very few artifacts, but a few sherds of the mouth rim of a Sugu-like vessel were identified in the third layer. Identification of shells used for shell ornaments : Chelyconus (Mörch), Pugilina haemifusus (Gmelin), Pyrene testudinaria tylerae (Griffith et Pigeon), Oliva mustelina (Lamarck), Unio douglasiae nipponensis (von Martens), Turbo marmoratus (Linne). They are all warm-water shells.</page><page sequence="31">54 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 5, 1964 Note: Definite proof of a relation between this burial site and nearby Yayoi sites has not been established, in spite of successive periods of investigation. The passage stating that the method of disposal conforms to that of 'southern islands' refers to the Ryûkyû islands where a similar disposal method has been practised from a date yet unknown to this day. There is little doubt that this disposal method spread from China probably at different times to different areas; mostly it was abandoned in favour of other methods, but has survived in some areas to this day. The results of later seasons of research on this site indicate that both types of disposal were found on one level. (Like site Doigahama, p. 52, the simple burials are, with one exception, female skeletons adorned with shell pendants and beads in a way that suggests they were ritual experts.) This again presents a parallel to recent Ryûkyû practices whereby the female ritual experts alone of all people are exempted from the second and third phases of the disposal method. The one exception is a young male transvested with exactly the same adornments as the females. This is also occasionally found in the Ryükyüs among ritual experts and might be a parallel case. It is not suggested by this commentator that the recent and contemporary multiple disposal method of the Ryükyüs is derived genetically from Yayoi- time Tanegashima.

A deposit with cultural artifacts found on the summit of Mt Shiroyama (250 metres) was excavated. In its three layers were numerous artifacts of middle Yayoi date.

SAGA CULTURAL ASSETS REPORT Hayamajiri Dolmen Site [The following report is not taken from Archeologia Japónica , but from the Saga Prefecture Educational Committee's Cultural Assets Report (1956). I give it here for its exceptional importance.] The continental methods of disposal of the dead in jars, stone cists, etc., have entered Japan through northern Kyüshü. Another manner of disposal, in dolmens, has come to light in recent years. Its distribution is limited to North Kyüshü, i.e. the Itoshima county of Fukuoka prefecture % ft, 1I1SIH and the Karatsu district of Saga prefecture JS # Tfí , fe @ H . The present site is situated within the boundary of Karatsu town JS^rfí, Kagamihanda B on a foothill of the Chikushi mountain range, facing the coastal plain. The whole district is dotted with sites of the Yayoi Period and dolmen groups, where surface bronze implements and Han Period mirrors have been found. The area is said to coincide with the country of Matsura of the Wei-chih Wo-jên chuan ÎÈ;ËffiÀ#. The Hayamajiri site, which was discovered in the course of cultivating the fields, contained 5 dolmens with 26 jar burials. The dolmens are big cover stones and several supporting stones, all left in their natural state (Pl. XI). Burial jars and pits were found under the cover stones (Fig. 9). Dolmen No. 1 ; It lies on the north side of the hillock. The cover stone is 1-85 metres long, 1-2 metres broad and 30 to 40 centimetres thick. Its weight is 1,272 kg. In shape it is a somewhat irregular rectangle. Before excavation only the cover stone was partly visible. The 7 supporting stones are all between 20 to 50 centimetres long. Directly under the cover stone, which was lifted by block and tackle, were 6 burial jars (two single jars turned upside-down, one single jar buried upright, three jars and pots placed mouth to mouth). Few burials of several indivi- duals under one dolmen, or an upright burial of jars, had been discovered to date. Dolmen No . 2 is very near and almost parallel to No. 1 : There is also very little difference in their size. Between the supporting stones ochre-painted pottery sherds were found. Directly under the cover stone a rectangular pit with rounded corners</page><page sequence="33">56 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES S, 1964 was found. No human remains. Two burial jars were just outside the pit walls (both of them of the jar-cum-pot variety, cf. Pl. Va). Fig. 9. Diagram of a dolmen with jar-burial. Sekai kõkogaku daikei , Nihon 2: 31. Dolmen No. j: The supporting stones are again laid out in the shape of a 'turtle' (head, 4 legs, tail). Under the cover stone was a round pit lined with small stones at the bottom centre. The stones are of a sort not seen in this area. Two burial jars (jar-cum-pot) are of the very rare, early Yayoi Ongagawa type (see Yayoi ware in Kyûshû, pp. 33-34). Since they too were buried upright, the remains are broken into very small fragments. Nearby is a layer containing Yayoi pottery sherds and charcoal. Dolmen No. 4 lies to the east of the hill. It is the smallest of all, and the most nearly rectangular. The supporting boulders are again left in 'turtle' form. An obsidian arrow point was found near the bottom of the pit under the dolmen. Dolmen No. 5 has not yet been investigated. Judging by trial soundings with a boring rod it appears to contain burial jars. The stone material used for the cover stone is the same as that used later in the construction of stone chambers ; the site where this stone was quarried has also been discovered. North of No. 5 eight further jar burials, tubular beads and iron fragments were found. Jar burials also surround No. 1 while tubular beads, bone fragments and teeth are strewn over the surface of the area. Judging by pottery fragments this site seem to range from early to late Yayoi. Note : Dolmens are known from the early phase in North Kyûshû ; they are com- paratively numerous in the middle phase and rare in the late phase. In type they conform to the dolmens of South Korea checkerboard type SlÄ,a cover stone supported by a number of boulders, as contrasted to the table dolmens prevalent in North Korea. The Kyûshû specimens are of a very ordinary size when compared to the South Korean dolmens which are very often combined with stone cists. However, the principle of 'lineage tombs^P) or, at least, several burials under one dolmen is found there too.</page><page sequence="34">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 57 References Fujita Ryösaku 1955 Kita Kyüshü shisekibö-kenkyü, in Matsuo Teisaku Festschrift , Hayamajiri shisekibögun: 33-84, Tõkyõ.

Participants: Takiguchi Hiroshi, Burial-mound Research Group of Waseda Univer- sity, Tõkyõ. Reporter: Tamaguchi Tokio. The area of the abandoned Futagawa settlement fiZlJII# near Shibayama village is dotted with about 400 burial mounds. The two southernmost structures of this group, locally known as tonozuka WtM (the lord's mound) and himezuka (the lady's mound) were studied (Fig. 10). The tonozuka has an overall length of 88 metres, frontal width (square annex) of 48 metres and a height of 10-4 metres (measured from the moat), it is the largest of the group. Since the moat appears to have been filled in to the extent of 1*5 metres, the original height of the mound may have been 13 metres. The apex of the annex is at present 36 centimetres lower than that of the mound. This mound is of the keyhole-shaped variety. It was originally surrounded by a double moat and an earth- wall. The moat is still clearly visible on the west and north sides, but has been levelled by farming in the south. Its floor level is natural loam and the stone chamber is located in its south part. The four walls and the ceiling are made of sandstone ; the ceiling had already fallen in. There is no clear indication of a passage. The dimensions of the chamber are: length 2-74 metres, width of the entrance wall 2*5 metres. It is divided into front and rear parts by a stone partition. The whole chamber is painted cinnabar red. Its funeral furniture which is found mainly in its rear part consisted of 1 large curved bead (6 centimetres), 4 large glass beads, 5 medium-sized beads, some tens of small beads, 5 amber beads, 6 gold rings, 8 gold-copper bells, 5 iron swords, 1 dagger, several tens of iron arrow-points, 3 bronze bowls. Behind the apex of the mound were found several cylindrical haniwa in their original arrangement. The figurative haniwa arranged on the step midway to the mound's summit were discovered in the moat into which they must have rolled by the steep incline from the ledge, where they originally stood. From the moat</page><page sequence="35">58 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 8, 1964 Fig. io.

In the moat surrounding the mound were mostly haniwa of aquatic birds, wild ducks and hawks. Broken house and utensil-shaped haniwa (arrow-cases, armour) were found in the area between the mound and the square annex. Many fragments of anthropomorphic haniwa were also found in the moat. Ordinary cylindrical and trumpet-shaped cylindrical haniwa are buried at intervals of one metre in the north part of the earth- wall ; in their midst were two strangely shaped anthropomorphic haniwa.

Mound No. 7 was discovered 40 or 50 years ago when the stone chamber fell open. The long axis of the chamber extends north-south. A sedimentary rock served for building material. Dimensions (at floor level): depth 2-5 metres, width 1-26 metres, height 1-7 metres. The far, right and left walls are constructed from one large stone each. One of three capstones which formed the ceiling is now missing. It seems that there was once a stone prop to keep the entrance wall from falling in. Two- thirds of the chamber are below ground level. The passage way, which has a sandstone wall but no cover, slopes up from the chamber. This form of structure may have been resorted to for lack of suitable stone material. West of mound No. 7 are burial mounds 9, 10, 11 which have not yet been investigated. The himezuka lies parallel to the tonozuka. It is also keyhole-shaped and sur- rounded by a single moat and an earth- wall. Its dimensions are: length 58 metres, width of the square annex 35 metres, width of the mound 36 metres, height of the annex summit 4 metres; the summit of the mound is 58 centimetres lower. However, since the mound makes use of a natural slope, it appears to be 10 metres high. The stone chamber was found in the south part of the square annex. Its entrance is reached by a passage 3 metres long; it has a vaulted appearance, for two boulders were hollowed out on the underside and fitted into position. The walls of the chamber are made of well-fitting sandstone slabs and the side walls slope to form a vault 1*4 metres wide at floor level diminishing to 7*8 centimetres at the ceiling. The floor is paved with irregularly shaped sandstone slabs. The funeral furniture contained the following items: 4 curved agate beads, 2 crystal beads, 3 amber beads, 6 gold rings, fragments of 2 large gilded (inlay?) swords, more than 10 iron swords, 1 dagger, 4 spherical gold ornaments, several gilded ornaments, several tens of iron arrow-heads and nails, 2 Sue vessels. The haniwa placed on the central step running the whole length of the mound were found undisturbed. Ordinary cylindrical haniwa were arranged along the south part of the square annex with 2 trumpet-shaped cylindrical haniwa inter- spersed. A distance of over 50 metres from the north part of the square annex and around the mound, is set off with a row of figurine haniwa. Their arrangement is as follows: i anthropomorphic haniwa, 4 horses with one male human figure each, 2 anthropomorphic haniwa presumably representing guards, a group of male haniwa (one with a koto ^ across his knees), 5 female haniwa figures and, at the far end of the row, one more male anthropomorphic haniwa. From the trench dug into the central step one male naked haniwa doing obeisance was recovered. The upper bodies of all these anthropomorphic figures are well made and some have very interesting facial features. The haniwa accompanying the tonozuka are so different from those of the himezuka that a chronological gap, or manufacture by another group (of potters?) may be assumed. Note: This site is important because original and undisturbed haniwa arrange- ments are very rarely found.</page><page sequence="37">6o ASIAN PERSPECTIVES S, 1964 Ichigao Site AJ, 9(1956): no Location : Kanagawa prefecture W^jllfS, Yokohama city fililí, Kohoku ward M db E , Ichigao site Tff V % .

The 20 horizontal tombs in this group were divided into three types, A(i2), B(7) and C(i). [Not defined in detail, but type C is mentioned in the following report - Translator .] Although types A and B show typological differences, they appear to be contemporaneous. The funeral objects recovered were straight swords, daggers, beads, copper rings, Haji and Sue ware.

Öba-machi stone-chamber group. This consists of 9 tombs of type A and one of type B. Several burial mounds are found on the plateau above them. Shikagaya dwelling site . By boring holes and cutting trenches it was possible to get a reasonably clear idea of the scope of the settlement, its structure and the nature of its individual dwellings. No extensive excavation was possible because the whole area is under cultivation. Six dwellings of the Yayoi Period and eleven of the Burial-mound Period were identified. The Yayoi dwellings were associated with either barrel-shaped it Ã pottery of North Kantõ it BS ^ (index type pottery of the late Yayoi phase in North Kantõ) or the Kugahara ÍK J5S pottery of South Kantõ Ä SI 3K (index pottery from earliest to former half of the late phase in South Kantõ). Four pit-dwellings were found to be contemporary with the horizontal stone-chamber tombs and dated Mama Period iK Iffl (later half of the middle phase). Report on type C stone chambers , p. iii, by Ishino Road construction in the past has cut off part of the passage. There is no apparent ante-room or clear demarcation towards the chamber. The width and height of the passage appear to increase towards the interior. Its height is i*i metres, width 95 centimetres; at the far wall of the chamber its height is i*i metres, the width 1-29 metres. A step 20 centimetres high stands at the i-6o metres mark of the present passage length (it accounts for the increase in height). The passage is paved with 14 pebbles and the chamber with 29. Note : Ishino ends his report with a reference to the identity of the tombs with the recent and present-day turtle-shaped i? or house-type tombs of the Ryükyüs (also horizontal stone-chamber type), in particular the existence of an enclosed ritual forecourt used for funerary and post-funerary rites.

The Ryükyüan tombs, as described above, were introduced from South China at a time not at all comparable with the early date of the above Japanese tombs. This applies to all other megalithic structures in the Ryükyüs (dolmens, terrace tombs, stepped tombs, menhirs, prestige tanks) so far as I have seen, though they are allegedly of Japanese derivation, because they resemble the Korean/ Japanese type(?) of megaliths. However, since there is a gap of about 1,000 years between them, a genetic relation- ship is unthinkable. Typological and chronological affinities exist with areas to the south of the Ryükyüs.

The northwestern part of the Kyoto plain, where River Hozu enters it, is rich in burial mounds with horizontal stone chambers. The present structure is situated south of the Hirosawa High School, Nishiura-machi IS JE BT . The mound is destroyed to the extent that the stone chamber is exposed. It was probably origin- ally a round burial mound (diam. 30 metres, height over 4 metres). The entrance of the stone chamber faces south. Its overall length is 12 metres, that of the chamber 4-3 metres. The width at the far wall measures 2-3 metres. The passage is no nar- rower than the chamber, but its height lower. The natural slope of the ground is made level by a layer of yellowish clay which also fills spaces between the wall stones. The chamber has a paved stone-slab floor. A house-shaped coffin appears to have been deposed near the far wall; at present only fragments of its cover are preserved. The chamber was silted up with soil and sand, due to some missing capstones, and because it was used for subsequent burials. Sue ware (footed dish, long-necked jar, covered jar of a late phase) was found arranged in the northeast corner of the chamber and on the floor of the passage (Fig. 6, p. 37). In the south- west corner a second burial, cremated remains and a few small Sue flasks, pots, Haji plates, iron nails and, nearby, old coins were found. A third burial was prob- ably placed near the entrance to the chamber, accompanied by a layer of small red plates. Since no skeletal remains were found there, this may possibly be an altar. Cases of stone chambers being used for burials or as shrines in historical times are numerous. Takehara Burial Mound ttlÄÄ AJ, 9(1956): 123 Location: Fukuoka prefecture ÜfSäM, Kuráte county ¥£¥!$, Wakamiya-cho Takehara burial mound. Date: 24-29 March 1956. Participant and Reporter: Mori Teijirõ.</page><page sequence="40">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 63 The site is on the central course of River Onga ® at the confluence of the Rivers Inunaki and Yamaguchi lil P and within the grounds of the Suwa shrine in Kami-Takehara (Fig. 12 a). The summit of the mound is 5 metres above the surrounding country, itself 7 metres above sea level. Although the eastern half of the structure has been completely levelled, its overall length of 30 metres would suggest a small keyhole-shaped type. When the site was discovered in 1956, the Education Committee was called in to do research and preservation : the site was declared Cultural Property in the following year. Fig. 12a. Takehara Burial Mound. The mound is built over a horizontal vaulted chamber (2-2 metres by 2-7 metres) with passage, anteroom and short corridor (overall length 6-7 metres; Fig. 126). Though the chamber had been robbed, we could see that burials had been disposed along the far and right walls. A ceremonial sword, mortar, bridle-bit, crupper and other ornamental horse trappings, all of late Burial-mound Period formed the funerary furniture. Further items were: 1 pair of gold rings, 1 pair of silver rings, curved beads of crystal and quartz, 4 large green glass beads, 3 glass beads (light yellow or green) 2 amber beads, 25 glass beads (mauve), 9 silver bells, pure gold thread 10 centimetres long, diam. 1-5 millimetres, copper thread, gilt-copper sword ornaments, 2 sword pommels, one small part to keep in place the sword-guard, etc. The far wall of the chamber displays an interesting mural 11 which forms a triptych with the murals on the lower halves of the entrance stones to the ante- room, when seen from a distance. Red sparrows, drawn in black and ochre, are still clearly recognized on the right side, although they were covered with black soil and badly damaged when discovered. Their style and execution, as well as the motif itself, strongly recall the murals in Koguryo īā'rJK (Korea) tombs. The mural on the left side, painted on to a rough andesite boulder, is so damaged that its presence is barely noticeable.</page><page sequence="41">64 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 8 , 1 964 Fig. 126. Profile and ground-plan of the stone chamber. The mural on the far wall is 2 metres long, 1-4 metres high, and is painted on chlorite schist. Black and red pigments were dissolved in oil and the painting very skilfully executed with pointed and flat brushes. In the mural are ritual fans (signs of rank) on both sides of the foreground. A fabulous animal Sï ^ (half-horse, half-dragon), of a kind also known from Manchurian and Koguryo tombs, occupies the centre. The claws of the animal, each drawn in one bold brush stroke, and the spiky tail have further striking parallels in Koguryo murals. Great care seems to have been taken in drawing the human figure in the lower left corner ; details like hat, hair-style and shoes are clearly recognizable, but eyes and nose appear to have been left out. A horse, two boats and 'bunting' on the right side, complete the motifs represented on the mural. At the end, towards the base, are two pairs of wave-like ornaments, which to the reporter did not look like sea (Fig. 12 c). Note: Single Koguryo stylistic elements and motifs had been found in several burial-mound murals, but never before had they been found in such concentration and such faithfulness on Japanese soil.</page><page sequence="42">JAPAN ERIKA KANEKO 65 Fig. 12 c.

Miikedaira Burial Mound Hüb AJ , 11(1958): 119 Location: Shizuoka prefecture SI IS iß, Ihara county M EHM, Miikedaira burial mound. Date : 29 April - 8 May. Participants: Shizuoka University, Historical Institute, Archaeological Institute of Meiji University, Tõkyõ, et al. Reporter: Otsuka Hatsushige. It is situated on the crest of the mountain and belongs to the keyhole-shaped variety. Length of the square annex : 72 metres, mound diameter 40 metres, width of the square annex 38 metres, height of the annex 3 metres, height of the mound 4 metres. Though its shape has already greatly changed, it can be dated to the early phase of the Burial-mound Period. A natural elevation was used. No haniwa was found. A belt of stones (7 metres wide) around the foot of the mound may have served as demarcation in lieu of haniwa cylinders. Apparently the belt originally also enclosed the annex. A vertical stone chamber is built into the mound; length 2-85 metres, depth 80 centimetres, width 86 centimetres. The walls are constructed by piling up flat stones horizontally. A hollowed-out log-type stone coffin was found in the vertical chamber. Length 2-5 metres, width 75 centimetres with a cartridge-shaped cover. There are no projections for cording. Funerary furniture was found within the coffin and in the space between the coffin and the stone chamber walls. In the head part of the coffin we found : a Chinese Han mirror, a Sui mirror, 2 bronze items (function unknown, presumably a cane head), 2 stone spinning weights, 4 scallop- shaped stone objects. Outside, near the foot end of the coffin were: 10 large swords, 15 straight swords, 3 daggers, many iron arrow-heads, 6 iron axes, 2 sickles, 3 hoe blades, 2 plane blades, 2 iron sticks. Also inside the coffin were: 1 curved bead</page><page sequence="56">68 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 8&gt; 1 964 (glass?), 63 tubular beads, 197 small beads, 1 stone arm ring (steatite) one stone arm ring (jasper), one Japanese-made mirror imitative of a Chinese mirror, inferior quality. Note: This burial mound represents an important type of burial mound and stone chamber rare in Eastern Japan (4th~5th centuries).

Participants: Kojima Toshitsune, Date Muneyasu. Reporter: Date Muneyasu. Tamakiyama is a foothill of Mt Anashi. Three burial mounds, all keyhole-shaped, were located here and were numbered Nos. 1, 2, 3, from east to west. Only Nos. 2 and 3 were investigated. No. 2: Overall length 75 metres, square annex orientated west, width 40 metres, mound diameter 40 metres, mound summit 2 metres higher than its square annex. No . 3; Overall length 47-5 metres. Square annex orientated to the east, width 25 metres, mound diameter 25 metres, the mound was 2 metres higher than the annex. No haniwa was seen. Horizontal chambers are found in both its front and rear parts. The chamber under the mound is now without capstone; the chamber length is 4*66 metres, the width 2* 14 metres. It has a recess 50 centimetres deep on the east wall and another 40 centimetres deep on the west wall. The passage is 5-1 metres long and i-i metres wide. Towards its entrance it is closed with a pile of stones. The coffin may have been in the caved-in area in the centre of the chamber. The central part of the passage which is also stone- paved is partitioned off by a stone. There another coffin seems to have been deposed, as suggested by fragments. The dimensions of the stone chamber in the square annex are: overall length 8-i metres, chamber length 4-42 metres, width 2*13 metres, height 2-5 metres. In the west wall there is a niche 66 centi- metres deep. The funerary furniture consisted mainly in horse trappings and ornaments. There was a breast ornament with a pair of phoenixes, a bridle ornament with palmette motif, bridle-bit and gilded ornaments for all places where the leather strips of the harness intersect, and one pair of ring-shaped stirrups.
