<plain_text><page sequence="1">Systems Theory in International Relations: A Critique JOHN J. WELTMAN University of Southern California While confined in terms to the area of international relations, Professor Weltman here contributes a critique of systems theory which is applicable in any field. Whether or not his arguments are persuasive perhaps depends as much upon the initial commit- ments which the reader brings to the article as it does upon the arguments themselves, but it is a timely and sensible approach which will deserve the best efforts of systems theorists to combat. John J. Weltman did his graduate work at Johns Hopkins, and taught there and at Wesleyan before proceeding to USC. Other articles on international relations theory are appearing in the Journal of Politics, and with the present article they are part of a book-length project on this subject.</page><page sequence="2">302 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS International relations is a field marked historically by a fascination with questions and answers of the broadest scope. For a time the outlook known as "realism" seemed to provide the needed focus. The story of the demise of that approach is an oft-told tale, but a concern to generate a successor of similar generality continued. It may well be that this concern with theory which asks, and perhaps answers, the broadest questions serves to retard progress in the field. But if the Kuhnian analogy 1 has any relevance, this concern may well be the very condition for productivity. "Normal" scientific work, in this view, can only be carried on within a consensus about the terms, methods, and objects of investigation. In these pages I will examine the intellectual origins, nature, and position of systems theory as successor to realism, and the demonstrated capability of the systems approach to generate novel conclusions in practice. I will conclude by considering the relation between systems theory's logical structure and the pros- pects for its future usefulness in the generation of knowledge un- reachable without it. I The best known application of the systems approach to international relations is embodied in Morton A. Kaplan's System and Process in International Politics.2 Building on Kaplan's framework and modifying it to suit their own purposes, other authors have employed systems theory in many studies. Attempts have been made to apply the ap- proach to the understanding of modern European diplomatic history, to the analysis of geographically distinct groupings of states, and to the prospects for stability in the present and possible future international orders.3 The analysis of the systems approach to international relations had best begin with a cursory examination of the concept, "system," as understood generally by students of the field. Kaplan's definition is seminal, and is reproduced here at the risk of later repetition. A system of action is a set of variables so related, in con- tradistinction to its environment, that describable behavioral regu- larities characterize the internal relationships of the variables to 'Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (University of Chicago Press, 1962). 2 Morton A.

WELTMAN 303 each other and the external relationships of the set of individual variables to combinations of external variables.4 Through the use of this concept it is possible to describe the state of the system, and to delineate the requirements for its continued exist- ence. Processes contributing to these requirements are functional. The system is by definition in equilibrium. A disequilibrium indicates the dissolution of the system; with the ordered pattern of interaction previously defining it no longer operative, the system can no longer be distinguished from its environment. Having defined the system, with respect both to its component sets of observables-"structures"-and the processes these structures must carry on if the equilibrium is to be maintained-"functions"-it is possible to describe the system further in terms of its "states." Thus, for example, the equilibrium may be in various stages of stability or instability. The idea of the system provides the observer with a set of interrelations, through which he can find the value of an unknown variable-or at least generate a hypothesis as to its value-if he knows the values of the other variables in the system. Thus, given the system's structure and a specified stability-state, the type and degree of func- tional activity necessary to continue this situation could be specified. Changes in state or transformations of the system itself can also be interrelated in this fashion with other elements of the system. To be sure, the system does not exist by itself. Its operations cannot be explained solely through consideration of the interrelation of its elements. The extrasystemic universe is represented in systems theory by the "environment," which may include all data not defined as being part of the system. The environment may affect the operation of the system; the system may affect the environment. Furthermore, a more complex process, known as "feedback," may occur. This term has been borrowed by the systems theorists from cybernetics-the study of control mechanisms. It refers to a two-way interaction. The system may act to influence the environment, causing changes in the environment and its influence on the system, changes which serve themselves to affect the actions of the system. Thus an action of the system may serve to influence not only the environment but also subsequent actions of the system. The thermostat is commonly cited as an example of the process of feedback. In certain circumstances a system may exhibit "adaptive" or "learn- ing" behavior with respect to its environment. If the environment changes so as to produce disequilibrium within the system-thus, to 4 Kaplan, p. 4.</page><page sequence="4">304 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS eliminate it as a entity-it might react so as to order itself about a new equilibrium. It might then be understood as having "learned" the sort of behavior through which it could more successfully cope with the environment. Two terminologies are used in systems theory, and they should be carefully differentiated. There are, first of all, concrete descriptive statements or generalizations. Under this head fall statements about structure. When the system's structure is indicated, the writer is making statements about observable behavior. Certain sets of data have been observed (or are hypothesized to be observable) behaving according to certain regular patterns. Other types of statements, which we may refer to as "process" statements, are of a different order, however. To call them observable statements would be to stretch the meaning of "ob- servable" far beyond its common usage. When one deals with processes one is referring in some sense to a type of behavior and not directly to the concrete manifestation which that behavior might actually take (the latter, of course, being the structure). However these types of behavior are defined, it must be recalled that they are interpretations by the analyst at some remove from the observable data, the role of which, as illustrative of the process in one concrete manifestation, is secondary. Systems theory deals with concrete activities in terms of some larger meaning or consequence which relates them to the system as a whole. Systems theory's focus of attention is a mark of its intellectual descent. Systems theory in international relations is a product of two schools of thought-sociological functionalism and General Systems Theory. Sociological functionalism-the dominant school of contemporary American academic sociology-was to be one product of the reor- ientation in scientific thought from the concrete to the dynamic brought about under the influence of Darwinism in the nineteenth century. The most general of the many consequences of the impact of Darwinism . .. was to shift the conception of "scientific thinking" into a temporal perspective, to stress relations and activities as against terms and substances, genesis and development as against intrinsic character, transformation as against continuing form, dynamic pattern as against static organization, processes of con- flict and integration as against formal composition out of unchang- ing elements.5 In social thought, Darwin's influence made itself felt in the return to Horace M. Kallen, "Functionalism," Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, VI (1951), p. 523.</page><page sequence="5">JOHN J. WELTMAN 305 prominence of the organic metaphor, in the works of such men as Comte and Spencer. While the application of the metaphor in this period often yielded anthropomorphic concepts of societal purposi- veness and evolution which have outwardly been avoided since, it provided students of social life with foci of attention which would be carried over and refined, into modern social thought.6 These were a concern with the social entity as a whole, with the interrelations of its parts, and with the mode in which various operations contributed to the continued existence of that entity. These concerns were rendered into more abstract form in the new sociology. (1) The concept of "organic system" is generalized.... (2) The concept of "system" is given central theoretical status, becoming the point from which all analyses of structure and process are made; (3) the critical system is not identified with historical society.7 Sociological thought may be divided into "holist" and "elementarist" categories. "Holist" thought assumes that, "the whole is prior to the parts in the sense that its operations are irreducible to these parts and their properties." "Elementarist" thought proceeds from individuals, their actions and interactions. "Any notion that interaction possesses new or emergent properties such that some sort of whole with irreduc- ible properties of its own arises is a pure product of reification."8 Functionalism retains the "holist" primacy of the larger social entity. Indeed, it is only by insistence on such an analytic priority that the school can make any claim at all to uniqueness. The peculiar sense in which the term "function"9 is used in this school of sociology high- lights this point. In a well-known article Kingsley Davis noted the banality of functional analysis. If the intended meaning is simply that some order in societies is assumed and that every social force should be examined from the standpoint of its possible role in societal continuity (thus, as- 6 For a full examination of these points, see Don Martindale, The Nature and Types of Sociological Theory (Boston, 1960), pp. 447ff. 7Ibid., pp. 449-450.

What else could a sociologist do? If one sets out to study societies, one presumably sets out to study something that exists. If societies exist, there must be some sense in which each one more or less hangs together, and the question of how this is accomplished and not accomplished is a central one. 10 Thus any student of society who finds describable regularities or coherence in a social entity is engaged in "functional" analysis. Martin- dale suggests that the functional school's claim to distinctiveness in sociology follows from its use of "functional" as "appropriate," "nor- mal," "system-determined," and "system-determining" behavior. Obviously these meanings assume a fairly precise relation to a con- cretely defined larger social entity. The work of the major functionalist writers of today indicates with varying degrees of directness their dependence on such a relation. Parsons' insistence on a series of "functional prerequisites" deducible from the "social system" is well-known. 12 Merton's analysis begins with a definition of a "standardized . . . item," "to which functions are imputed." "Functions are those observed consequences which make for the adaptation or adjustment of a given system.... 13 In Marion Levy's analysis, "Determination of the functional requisites of a system is reached by an examination of the minimal requirements set by the interrelationship of the particular system concerned and its set- ting.... 14 The derivative, "structural-functional," school of analysis in political science exhibits characteristics similar to its sociological parent. David Easton's analysis assumes, "that the elements of political life have some form of determinate relation." 15 The political system is a subsystem of the larger social system which fulfills one of the essential "functions" of that society, namely the "authoritative allocation of values." 16 10 K.

WELTMAN 307 The eclectic reader of the functional sociologists and of their coreli- gionists in political science, however, cannot but gain the impression that extensive examination of the nature of the larger entities-the systems-which ostensibly form the starting points of their theoretical structures, is rather pointless. For if the system is the logical requisite of these theories, it is the function which is their main focus. Obviously if one states, "X performs the function Y," the question, "for what?," or, "in terms of what?," must follow. The idea of the "system" is an effort to fill up a logical gap revealed when the attempt is made to render a mode of thought explicit. But it is a gap whose existence does little to affect adversely the pragmatic utility of the mode of thought as a method of explaining complex phenomena. Certainly some amount of abstraction from concrete data is unavoidable, and the abstraction which seeks to understand what it is that certain behavioral patterns mean for the operations of groups or collectives, is certainly necessary to any social science. But these operations can be carried out-although perhaps not logically defended-without answering the question, "func- tional for what?," in terms of another abstraction. Whether in fact such an abstraction can be developed which would provide a rationally defensible validation for the process, must remain an open question; we will shortly examine the usefulness of some abstractions which have been presented for this purpose. That their primary concern is for the functions, rather than the system, is indicated by the residual definitions of "system" adopted initially by many functionalist writers. Thus Levy begins with a definition of a "system" as "any patterned collection of elements." 17 Easton con- sistently equates "system" with "coherence," 18 or similar words. At bottom these writers are saying nothing more than that a system is not a random collection of elements, or an anarchic universe of data. Very little positive is said about the system. A system is something which has pattern and coherence; that is to say, it is an intelligible way of organizing data. But it is difficult to see how any attempt of whatever mode to understand the world rationally could deal with anything except patterned materials. The idea of system appears almost an aesthetic device, serving to lend balance to the theory; a formal defi- nition of function must be equated with a similar statement of that with respect to which functions pertain. Our topic's second intellectual parent is more recent in origin, and carries a claim for wider relevance in application than its first. Although 7 Levy, p. 20.

GST is a critical response to science's increasing specialization. It attempts to develop a unified set of concepts which can be used to generate hypotheses applicable in many fields, including those previ- ously thought unrelated to one another. GST further claims to bring teleological questions, regarded by the orthodox as metaphysical since Galileo and Newton, back under the purview of "hard" science. By putting the relationships among objects in given scientific fields into the most abstract form, GST is able to develop "systems" en- compassing their most general characteristics. When data from various fields are abstracted, similarities among them may become apparent. These similarities may form the basis for novel hypotheses about concrete data. Furthermore science's lack of concern with matters "teleological" has been the product of an unnecessary restriction of analysis to only one type of system, the "closed" system. GST presents the "open" system as an alternative, capable of dealing with questions previously termed "metaphysical," without loss of rigor. One definition of GST's basic unit of analysis suggests a holist bias similar to that in functional sociology. A system is a set of objects together with relationships between the objects and between their attributes. Our definition does imply of course that a system has proper- ties, functions or purposes distinct from its constituent objects, relationships and attributes. 19 Isomorphies, "structural similarities" among systems, are the key to GST's claimed role as the unifier of science. "In certain aspects, corresponding abstractions and conceptual models can be applicable to different phenomena." The scope of this role is in some dispute, however. Von Bertalanffy looks to the establishment of "universal principles applying to systems in general."20 Kenneth Boulding sug- gests a more limited role for these isomorphies, "to point out similari- ties in the theoretical constructions of different disciplines . . ," or, "in directing research towards the gaps which they reveal. ..." 21 If the latter claim is considered, few problems arise, since no claim '9 A.

WELTMAN 309 need be made for the validity of an hypothesis suggested by noting an isomorphy. At the simplest, this view treats the systems approach as a convenient way to develop systematic analyses by concentrating on the external features and behavior of the data. The strategy, first of all, of conceiving of many kinds of phe- nomena in terms of working relations among their parts and then of labeling them systems according to a definition of what part of the "problem" is most relevant is the key to the approach.... It is clear that there are no behavioral theories-as such-in the general systems framework, but it is also clear that specific theories about regularities and relationships of one and another kind of complex system can grow on this ground. 22 It is difficult to see, however, in what sense any empirical analysis could proceed without considering the "working relations among [the] ... parts" of the phenomena in question. If the "system" is to be considered indeed as nothing more than an economical symbol direct- ing us to that mass of data we call "working relations," little fault can be found with it, since such methods must always be involved in any form of research. Von Bertalanffy's viewpoint goes far beyond this limited scope and does involve a claim to validity for the hypotheses suggested by the discovered isomorphies, however. He seems to assume that ultimate reality is to be found in the qualities which inhere in patterns of relationships. Phenomenal data, only illustrative of the greater order, are distinctly secondary. Just as "isomorphies" are the vehicle for GST's role in unifying science, so the "open" system is the means whereby science's domain is to be expanded. Classical science's model of its data has been the "closed" system, treated as isolated from its environment. Without intrusion from the outside the final state of the system is determined by its initial state. If an intrusion occurs, and this initial state changes, the final outcome changes also. 23 This assumption of isolation, however, is not fulfilled by many of the systems with which the scientist actually deals, most notably by the living organism. The latter is an example of an "open" system whose operation is accompanied by a continuous two-way exchange with its environment. Obviously the initial state in these systems cannot de- termine the final state; organisms manifest an ability to tolerate con- 22 Charles A.

J., 1965), p. 258. 23 von Bertalanffy, pp. 3-4.</page><page sequence="10">310 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS siderable variation in environmental influence, while maintaining steady operations. Thus the "open" system is characterized by "equifinality," "... the same final state may be reached from different initial con- ditions, and in different ways." 2 Classical or closed systems tend toward a state of positive entropy, or rest. Since energy flow only occurs in one direction the system tends over time to arrive at a complete random undifferentiated state, where all movement stops. At this point there would be no system since there would no longer be a differentiable patterning of elements. Open systems, however, take in energy as well as release it. They may therefore reverse this process and increase negative entropy, or orga- nization; that is to say, the process in open systems may be toward more complex patternings of elements. Since randomness is a concrete state, which can be expressed as a mathematical function, orga- nization-conceived merely as complementary to randomness-can be similarly expressed. "Entropy ... is a measure of disorder; hence negative entropy ... is a measure of order or organization since the latter, compared to the distribution at random, is an improbable state." 25 Order, and organization-in living systems at least-can be equated with purposive behavior. Therefore, through the concept of negative entropy we can deal rigorously with ordered and purposive behavior. Prior to this, apparent instances of "purpose" or "order" inhering in the world were treated by science as projections by men of analogies drawn from their own minds onto aspects of nature incompletely subsumed under causal generalizations in closed systems. 26 The non-metaphysical nature of concepts such as purpose and direc- tiveness flows from the assertion that randomness and organization are merely two sides of the same coin, that the two concepts may be placed in the same logical category. Randomness, however, is a simple de- scriptive term describing a specific state. Organization is a general term, vaguely linking together many different types of concrete situations. No precise description follows immediately from the denotation of a set of data as "organized;" a very definite concrete description follows when this data is described as "random." When something is called "organized," we follow this with a precise statement of "how." It is this "how" statement that truly describes the data we are examining, not the reference to it simply as "organized." If we cannot accept the claim that "organization" has as precise a 24 Ibid., p. 4. 25 Ibid., p. 5. 26 Ibid., p. 5.</page><page sequence="11">JOHN J. WELTMAN 311 meaning as "random," then we cannot accept either the claim that "purposive" behavior, a type of organized behavior, has been removed from its metaphysical setting. If we find "purposive" behavior attri- buted to the objects of scientific investigation, suspicion of the anthro- pomorphic fallacy will remain. II On both sides of systems theory's intellectual genealogy, then, there are significant questions of conceptual clarity and logical validity. But the test of an approach to analysis lies in its utility, as well as its origins, and utility can only be judged in practice. Like the bumble-bee, a theory whose logic is aerodynamically absurd may still fly. To deal with the question of systems theory's utility in practice, we must assess in detail the contributions produced by the principal attempts to apply the framework to the study of international relations. It becomes obvious quickly, however, that systems theory has not been applied in any uniform fashion in these various enterprises. The content of the applied theory ranges from stylistic allusion to a full display of its complex conceptual paraphernalia. Some writers show more of the influence of functional sociology, some of General Systems Theory. A certain unevenness in the acceptance of new ways of thinking is only to be expected, and these divergencies need raise no insuperable obstacles to our analysis. We will examine the conclusions reached by these various attempts, and their methods of generating them. Was the systems framework necessary to the process? Did the framework-at whatever level of elaboration-add to the validity of these conclusions, or did their validity depend solely on extraneous factors? Certainly the dominant work in the field remains Morton A. Kaplan's System and Process in International Politics. A measure of this dominance may well be the fact that, while there have been many attempts to apply his work, no general work comparable to his has gained any widespread acceptance. The heart of Kaplan's work consists of six international "systems," two of them explicitly drawn from historical experience. For each system, Kaplan specifies the appropriate types of actor, and the system's "essential rules." He then analyzes the conditions for the system's stability or instability-the latter producing the "implicit transformation rules" 27 whereby change into another system occurs. 27 Kaplan, System and Process in International Politics, p. 2.</page><page sequence="12">312 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS The manner in which a system's "essential rules," describing its "characteristic behavior," 28 are determined, is left somewhat unclear. They clearly do not all follow from the behavior objectively required for the continuance of the system in question. Indeed, differing rules could in many cases be substituted for the rules Kaplan states, without impairing systemic survival. Furthermore, insofar as either the "trans- formation" or the "essential" rules can be regarded as hypotheses about behavior, they are often tautologous or impossible to verify oper- ationally, or both. Thus, in his "balance of power" system, two rules 29 enjoin actors to a policy of increasing capabilities. No convincing argument is made why the rules could not enjoin simply maintenance of capabilities. Another rule states that actors are not to eliminate an "essential national actor." 30 At first glance this rule is only a tautology: if an actor is eliminated, it must, thus, not have been "essential." Even, however, if we assume that "essential national actor" is only Kaplan's translation of the traditional term, "great power," the basis on which the rule has been laid down is still unclear. Kaplan had earlier31 stated that this system could be composed of "at least five and preferably more" actors. If there are only five present in a given system, the rule is understandable; elimination of one would destroy the system, by defi- nition. But suppose, for example, there are eight actors. Why couldn't the elimination of one-or three-of these actors be consonant with maintenance of the system? The genesis of these rules is not the characteristics of the system as stated, nor any process of deductive reasoning as to the policies re- quired of individual actors if the system is to be maintained. It must stem from other, unstated, considerations. In this case, Kaplan is evidently relying on his assumptions about the policies pursued by states in the classical balance of power period in the mid-eighteenth century. The role of such unstated assumptions in formulating systemic rules, as well as the unfalsifiable character of many important rules, is further suggested in the "loose bipolar" system. This system assumes two "bloc" groupings of states, each dominated by a major power, a third "neutral" grouping, and an international organization. The rules pre- scribe relations of considerable hostility between the blocs, with war 28 Ibid., pp. 9-10. 29 Rules 1 &amp; 2, Ibid., p. 23. 30 Rule 3, Ibid., p. 23. 31 Ibid., p. 22.</page><page sequence="13">JOHN J. WELTMAN 313 being considered an appropriate policy for the furtherance of their interests in certain circumstances, notably to keep an opponent from attaining "a position of preponderant strength." Each is to pursue a somewhat different policy in certain particulars, depending on the type of "integrating" or "organizational principles for the international system to which it subscrib[es]." Blocs subscribing to "directive or mixed hierarchical" principles are "to fight major wars-under given risk and cost factors-rather than to fail to eliminate the rival bloc." Blocs whose principles are "non-hierarchical or non-directive hierarchi- cal," are, however, "to refrain from initiating major wars for this purpose." The neutrals, in conjunction with the international organ- ization, are to mediate between the two blocs, and reduce tensions. 32 This series of policy injunctions is by no means necessary as a condition for the stability of the system. In fact quite a different set of rules would be just as plausible. Thus, the bloc actors could operate only to maintain, not to increase their capabilities, with neither actor resorting to force except as a consequence of prior resort to it by its opponent. The non-bloc member national actors could put their own interests ahead of the prevention of war between the bloc actors. The international organization could simply amplify the objectives of the bloc actors. Kaplan's scheme suggests a picture of two hostile, aggressive blocs locked in constant conflict. Monolithically hostile to both, and with considerable control over the international organization, are the neu- trals. It appears Kaplan has not chosen his scheme because of any implicit plausibility as necessary for stability in this system, but simply because it seemed to represent, in a schematized way, a view of international politics dominant in the mid-1950's. Whether or not the rules he suggests are especially compelling, they are difficult, if not impossible, to test. Certain divergencies in the rules prescribed for the bloc actors flow, it will be recalled, from distinctions in the principles to which each subscribes for the ordering of the international system. How are such principles to be established? Do we abstract from a state's governing ideology, or its "sacred writings," if such exist? Do we analyze general passages in the speeches of leaders and in state papers? Surely such procedures cannot give us precise answers commanding wide agreement. The public outlook of leaders of the Soviet Union toward capitalist states, and the legitimacy of inter- national violence as a means to achieve universal social ends, have oscillated many times since the first flush of the Bolshevik revolution. 32 Ibid., pp. 38-39.</page><page sequence="14">314 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Presumably, Kaplan means to class the United States as a non-directive bloc. Yet calls to universal messianic missions have not been unknown in our history, and preventive war not too long ago enjoyed a vocal, if minority, vogue. Kaplan merely clothes his value preferences in the seemingly abstract language of a classification scheme. Given the ambiguity of the criteria on which such classifications must be made if they are not determined on patriotic grounds, they must be arrived at on the basis of the very bloc behavior which in Kaplan's scheme would serve as confirmation of his hypothetical essential rule. A failure to conform to the behavior predicted in the hypothesis could never prove the hypothesis wrong; it could only serve to indicate that the bloc in question had been wrongly classified. The transformation rules are not free from those faults which bedevil their "essential" comrades. They too are products of outside assump- tions about international relations and cannot pass the operational and confirmation tests normally required of scientific statements. Thus, the "tight bipolar system," composed, essentially, of the blocs of the loose bipolar system, without the neutrals or the international organization, is assumed to be unstable. Given Kaplan's scheme for the loose system this makes sense. The blocs were assumed to be the sources of tension; other actors operated so as to reduce this. If this scheme is challeng- ed-as we have done-Kaplan's conclusions for the tight system are by no means impeccable, and may be understood simply as reflecting an undocumented pessimistic point of view as to the stability of a bipolar distribution of power in international politics, depending only on the view that, "technological developments or other factors are unlikely to take place evenly." 33 Kaplan's general assumption here is that of instability in the strategic balance. The defense posture of each side would induce a significant fear of surprise attack and a consequent propensity to strike first. This picture of the strategic balance-common enough among analysts in the mid-fifties-has been considerably altered in the decades since. It is this picture, in any case-right or wrong-which Kaplan has grafted onto his formulation of the system and its prospects for change. The conclusions he draws owe much to the picture and little to the system. On the other hand, Kaplan portrays the "hierarchical" system as unlikely to be transformed into something else. This hypothetical system is distinguished by that legal mark which is often cited as the hallmark of a federation or a more highly centralized state: legal rules in this system are understood as binding individuals directly. Some form of international body is postulated as performing political and 33 Ibid., pp. 36-37.</page><page sequence="15">JOHN J. WELTMAN 315 judicial functions for the system as a whole. National units still exist, but "will lose their primary role-functions of transmitting the rules of the international system." 34 The conclusion, that this system is a highly stable one, is supported by the hypothesis that, "the functional lines across territorial divisions will be more communicative than chan- nels linking diverse functional activities within a given territory." 35 This statement, however, is less an empirical hypothesis than a definition of the categories involved. For how would such a hypothesis be operationally confirmed? Presumably, by observing the outcome in specific instances-including the ability of territorial units to sustain deviance with respect to the international system. Thus a "hierarchical" international system which disintegrated into a system in which the national units retained the primary role of transmitting systemic rules could not provide a counter-example to the transformation hypothesis. It would only indicate that the territorial channels were in fact the more communicative, and that the system had not been hierarchical in the first place. Thus, if they are not simply definitional, Kaplan's conclusions de- pend upon beliefs which are not explictly made part of his analysis. In Kaplan's work there are a series of assumptions of this sort. These assumptions, rather than systemic analysis, provide the basis from which his conclusions follow. Thus, Kaplan assumes rather than demon- strates the instability of the balance of nuclear deterrence. He assumes rather than demonstrates a tendency toward instability as the state structure approaches bipolarity. He assumes rather than demonstrates the direct influence of ideology on policy. In all of this Kaplan shows more that he accepts one of the orthodox Weltanschauungen of his time, than that he has provided us new tools to choose among them. The problems which bedeviled Kaplan's work have also appeared in that of other writers employing the approach, although the specific modes of procedure and objects of investigation are as many as there are writers. To Kaplan's dominantly hypothetical and deductive out- look, Richard N. Rosecrance 36 has counterposed an inductive approach proceeding from historical experience. The latter is concerned to eluci- date the "major determinants" of stability and instability in inter- national history since 1740. He divides this time-span into nine histori- cal periods, each of which is then translated into systemic form. Given the conceptual standardization afforded by the latter analysis, major conclusions can be drawn. 34 Ibid., pp. 48-49. 35 Ibid., pp. 49. 36 Action and Reaction in World Politics (Boston, 1963).</page><page sequence="16">316 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS History, we are often told, has "lessons" for us, both as scholars and as policymakers. This may be true, but its practical consequences are often less than unambiguous. For if history has lessons, it has as many and differing lessons as there are historians and readers of history. Rosecrance presents systems theory as a means whereby lessons may be drawn from history in a fashion to satisfy those for whom "knowledge" must meet the high standards 6f science. Unfortunately, Rosecrance's raw material, his interpretation of his- torical processes, is as subjective and open to question as is any writer's. Since the larger conclusions drawn from his systemic analysis follow from this interpretation, they have no more force than does his original reading of history. Furthermore, since the system analysis assumes a quantification of elements in the analysis of stability, elements the level of which remains subjective, the "conclusions" reached by this process remain only definitional. A brief glance through Rosecrance's historical periods will be suf- ficient to suggest the emphases and biases which color his explanations of the past. The security of tenure and the ideology of domestic elites are consistently regarded as the principal components in the expla- nation of international state action. As the converse of this, consider- ations related to the loci and intensity of interstate conflicts are relegated to peripheral positions 'in the explanatory process. Inter- national stability and instability, moreover, are regularly explained in terms of the success or failure of regulative influences. After 1789, finally, stability and instability tend to be equated rather directly with the presence or absence of war between major powers, without much further concern with the consequences of wars or their relation to the objectives of state policy. The dominance of ideological factors is evident in many of the periods which Rosecrance analyzes. In one such period, which he calls that of the "truncated concert" (1822-1848), state relations appear to be dominated by the idea-systems held by the various elites. Thus, the British policy of non-intervention, "was a benign and liberal doctrine flowing from the principles of 1688." 37 When British policy turns toward intervention, Rosecrance must go to some lengths to explain the development in purely ideological terms. "Canning was enormously fortunate in that actions of interest could be legitimized in liberal or constitutional terms." 38 The grouping of states into ideological camps is understood as the normal pattern of alignment; it is the deviation from this norm which requires explanation. "The promptings of in- 37 Ibid., p. 81. 38 Ibid., p. 91.</page><page sequence="17">JOHN J. WELTMAN 317 terest led to temporary alliances across ideological boundaries, and to temporary frictions within them...." 39 Ideological questions are cen- tral also to the interpretation of the operation of the Concert of Europe. The Concert "oscillates between contending principles...." This oscillation is possible since neither liberals nor conservatives held "effective ideological predominance."40 Warfare is not regarded as an acceptable or proper political instru- ment. 41 Since there were no wars, the period is considered stable, and the Concert powerful. The concert was strong enough to preclude warfare among major states.... War and revolution were not essential requirements of either conservative or liberal policy. The conflicts between the two camps, moreover, were muted by pursuit of territorial gain in the Near East and North Africa. 42 Thus the normal pattern of international conflict is along ideological lines. The absence of warfare-the sign of stability-is causally related to the operation of the Concert's sufficient "strength," even though war- fare was said to be an unacceptable political action anyway. The low intensity of European conflicts is only cited secondarily as a factor contributing to the lack of warfare in this period. The next period, the "shattered concert" (1848-1871), is considered unstable because of changes in the domestic position of elites in the great powers. The conservative triumphs in 1848 had not given the ruling classes greater security of tenure; indeed, the reverse was true. Once faced with direct challenge to their rule, the conservatives found their position less secure than before, despite their outward ascendancy. To shore up their positions, dynasts felt compelled to take on many of their opponents' trappings. Principal among these was the marriage with nationalism, since 1815 associated with the liberal cause.43 It was this conservative assimilation of nationalism which created international conflicts. "As the conservatives in Prussia and Austria were forced to take over the cause of German national unification, their ancient alliance vanished."44 If we assume that domestic ideologies were the prime determinants of state action, then indeed the Austro-Prussian conflict becomes a 39 Ibid., p. 101. 40 Ibid., p. 99.

However, if conflict between these powers for hegemony in Germany is understood as a recurrent feature of international relations since Frederick's conquest of Maria Theresa's Silesia in 1740, it is rather the periods of cooper- ation between them which require special explanation. Because of the occurrence of a number of wars in this period, Rosecrance terms it "highly unstable."45 More significant however, than the occurrence of a series of wars, was their limited and benign character, and their brevity. The period could as easily be described as stable, since violence was managed in such a way as to achieve political ends in a manner which did not destroy the existence of major partici- pants. Rosecrance relates this instability to "failure" by the Concert. 46 He makes the operation of the Concert part of his explanatory scheme, an inclusion which seems rather strained for this period. "Stability" and "regulation" are recurrent terms in Rosecrance's analysis of various historical periods. An international epoch ... is stable or unstable depending upon the balance of disruptive and regulative factors. If regulative in- fluences are not powerful enough to contain disruption and to produce outcomes within an acceptable range, the system is un- stable; if they can hold outcomes within acceptable bounds, the system is stable. 47 At best, however, these terms are redundant. "Stability," or successful "regulation," tend to have no meaning except the absence of war. If these terms are not required for the successful explanation of historical materials, their inclusion must arise from the author's anticipation of the requirements of the systemic analysis to follow. Rosecrance's systems "aim ... at stability."48 (Since systems not aiming thus are not provided, we assume Rosecrance intends that such a tendency be one of the system's defining characteristics. In any case it would probably be quite difficult in practice to distinguish a system not aiming at stability from one which did, but failed to achieve it.) The system is a set of relations among four components-a disturber, a regulator, a table of environmental constraints on disturbance, and the outcome. Stability occurs when the regulator "responds in such a way to the input that the environmental table mandates outcomes within a range regarded as stable or acceptable."49 Obviously, this range must 45 Ibid., p. 126. 46 Ibid., p. 118. 47 Ibid., p. 11. 48 Ibid., p. 220. 49 Ibid., p. 221.</page><page sequence="19">JOHN J. WELTMAN 319 be more precisely distinguished if this statement is not to be considered a tautology. Rosecrance assumes that changes in one of these components will lead to changes in output, all else being equal. Thus, if disturbance is increased, output will change and the system may become unstable, unless a change in one of the other components occurs to counter- balance the original increase, sufficient to keep the outcome unchanged or within the stable range. 50 One major problem which arises when the attempt is made to apply this scheme to international relations is the difficulty of classifying specific phenomena in the correct category. The use of the concept, "regulator," illustrates this. Initially this process is identified in terms of the effects of political action. It may be manifested in many ways, through institutions or informally. Presumably it may even be mani- fested unconsciously, "in the opposition of certain states in the system to the disturbing initiative of another or others." 51 This formulation leaves us confused, however, as to the precise criteria by which regulative activity is operationally defined. Are we dealing with the observed effects of specific processes, or with intended effects and tendencies deduced from avowed purposes? If the former, can we easily isolate and establish a firm connection between a given effect and a specific set of actions, or are we simply assuming by definition the success of the regulator, whenever certain effects occur? If the latter, how can we be certain that actual operations will coincide with declared aims? This uncertainty is apparent in the various senses in which the regulator appears when Rosecrance employs his analysis in his inter- national systems. The regulator in System I (1740-1789), thus, is informal, "evinced ... through the processes of the international sys- tem." 52 By System V (1848-1871), the regulator is almost completely equated with institutional mechanisms alone.53 In System VIII (1918-1945) this trend to institutionalization continues and the regu- lator is identified with the League of Nations. This development leads to the curious conclusion that the regulative institution itself becomes a disturbing force. "In its final years the League . . . became a disequilib- rial force in world politics." 54 Rosecrance begins his application of the concept of the regulator by classifying various actions of states in terms of their effects. He then 50 Ibid., c.f., pp. 222-223. 1 Ibid., pp. 229-30. 52 Ibid., p. 234. 53 Ibid., p. 248. 54 Ibid., p. 260.</page><page sequence="20">320 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS moves to add formal institutional mechanisms to this use. Progressively, these formal mechanisms become identified with the regulator to the exclusion of its informal components. This identification culminates in the regulative institution's becoming itself a force for disturbance. This progression is understandable in view of the difficulties involved in applying the concept. Since the effect of a given action is difficult to determine, it is much easier to equate the regulator with the operation of a given institution, especially one whose purposes are conveniently and explicitly stated. Some consideration of the content of a few of Rosecrance's inter- national systems will suggest the tautologous character of his conclu- sions regarding stability. Thus, in System I (1740-1789), "regulative and disruptive influences ... are approximately balanced...." The relation between disturber and regulator, "is such as to produce out- comes within the range of stability." 55 Since the period in question was considered stable on the basis of prior historical study, and since the systemic scheme assumes the correlation of stability with a certain relation between disruptive and regulative elements, this result is as- sured from the start, however. In System V (1848-1871), the analyst concludes, "disruptive influ- ences far outbalanced regulatory ones." 6 The relation between dis- turbance and regulation this time, "is such as to produce outcomes outside the acceptable range." 57 As evidence for such conclusions we find only a series of relative evaluations of specific factors. Thus the author may tell us that an increase in elite insecurity made them more prone than in a preceding period to shore up their domestic positions through adventure on the international scene. Or, he may maintain that, since the geographical areas in dispute were more central to the interests of states than in a previous period and conflicts thus less amenable to solution by com- promise, the "environment" provided fewer channels to siphon off international conflicts into peripheral areas. 58 But the multiplication of these individual relative statements does not add up to a statement about the balance of disturbing and regulating influences in a given system. Such a statement would require a tool not present, a common denominator into which the levels of various influences could be translated, so that they might directly be related to one another and comparable totals for disturbance and regulation developed. Without 55 Ibid., pp. 235-236. 56 Ibid., p. 247. 57 Ibid., p. 250. 58 Ibid., pp. 247-50.</page><page sequence="21">JOHN J. WELTMAN 321 such a tool, the statement becomes only a reiteration of the author's findings as to the system's historical stability. The assertion that dis- turbance and regulation are in given relative positions is based on a generalization arising out of the formal requirements of a closed defini- tional system, not on any empirical comparison of the data falling under these two categories. Without the existence of standards of measurement, the relationships between factors stated in the systemic analysis are simply restatements of historical conclusions arrived at judgmentally, conclusions for which a quasi-mathematical expression is a mere facade. If these criticisms are accepted with respect to Rosecrance's con- clusions in specific historical systems, they follow also for his general conclusions, supposedly reached by induction from these specific find- ings. Rosecrance finds, in brief, that the single factor most closely and directly related to stability, in the international relations of the west since the eighteenth century, has been the pattern of internal sta- bility. 59 If we can recall once more the general thrust of the historical interpretation which Rosecrance employs as the raw material and starting point for his systemic analysis, the definitional character of his final conclusion becomes apparent. Rosecrance's picture of history highlights the role of the domestic position of regimes in the process of explaining international actions. Conflict and cooperation among states are equated more with the ideologies and domestic positions of their regimes, than with the sorts of things in dispute, and the intensity of the disputes. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that a simple reformulation of this theme is later presented as the result of systemic analysis. The frameworks developed by Kaplan and Rosecrance have been employed by other writers to deal with a wide variety of more re- stricted concerns. 60 A number of writers, for example, have employed a systems approach in the analysis of the international politics of various regions of the world. 61 Striking in these studies, however, is the extent to which the approach is unnecessary to the conclusions reached.

One cannot help gaining the impression that the systems terminology was introduced into these studies mainly for stylistic reasons. Furthermore, the "system" as employed in these studies is given a very limited meaning. It becomes a neutral term, used merely to refer to a given mass of data. No attempt is made to give it the connotation of an entity with properties of its own. Systems theory has also been put to use investigating the question of international "stability." This topic has been, of course, of great topical interest since the Second World War and the changes in the inter- national structure of power which that war brought about. The decline in the number of states which could properly be termed "great powers" brought up the question of what effect that decline might have on the likelihood of major wars. Students of international relations had had considerable experience with the many-power arrangement which had existed in Europe since the late seventeenth century. While various analysts assessed that ar- rangement's successes and failures differently, the arguments for all positions were well-rehearsed and widely known. The bipolar arrange- ment which followed after 1945 cast students adrift from even this common fund of disagreement. The sixties presented a further com- plication as some saw the two blocs crumbling, and a partial or complete return to the pre-1945 period resulting. Given the technolo- gical context, which assured all that a major war would prove far more destructive than any which had occurred before Hiroshima, the analyst's prognosis came to be of compelling interest far beyond the academic fraternity.

WELTMAN 323 Discussion of this question began with the "received wisdom" in the field, whose expositors were the Realists. Morgenthau, for example, attributed the relatively benign character of the eighteenth century balance of power in Europe to its multilateral composition, and the relative uncertainty which this situation introduced into statecraft. The greater the number of active players, the greater the number of possible combinations and the greater also the uncertainty as to the combinations that will actually oppose each other and as to the roles the individual players will actually perform in them.... Whenever coalitions of nations comparable in power confront each other, calculations ... will of necessity be close, since the defec- tion of one prospective member or the addition of an unexpected one cannot fail to affect the balance of power considerably, if not decisively.... The extreme flexibility of the balance of power resulting from the utter unreliability of alliances made it impera- tive for all players to be cautious in their moves on the chessboard of international politics, and, since risks were hard to calculate, compelled them to take as small risks as possible.62 This view was challenged later by Kenneth Waltz, who maintained that a bipolar situation is less likely to produce major violence than a system of many powers. The very difficulty in gauging the moves of other powers which Morgenthau said produced caution and a strategy of limited risk, Waltz suggested produced instead conflict through miscalculation. This sort of miscalculation is eliminated in the present bipolar system, where there is only one other power whose activities are of real importance to the superpower statesman. Thus the attention of each power is riveted on the other. Possible maneuvers or alliance shifts by third states are unimportant, because of the latter's limited re- sources. World-wide bipolar conflict ensures that the actions of the other in a great variety of specific or unforeseen encounters will be highly predictable in advance. Thus, inadvertent collision owing to miscalculation of the response of the other is reduced to a minimum. Furthermore, the immense gap in power which separates the two major powers from all other actors, ensures that no specific object of conten- tion between them can alone afford one side enough of an increment to materially affect the balance between the "big two." Thus, no one crisis could threaten losses so catastrophic as to tempt a desparate losing side to recoup through resort to general war. 63 Waltz's conclusion is that a 62 Hans J.

Each of these analyses seems plausible on its face. Unfortunately, when placed side by side they are in direct contradiction. Some have attempted to decide this substantive issue through the use of some form of systemic analysis. Kaplan himself touched on the question often in System and Process. As we have seen, his conclusions supported the traditional view: both bipolar systems were less stable than the balance of power system. Unfortunately, as we have also seen, his conclusions only supported the traditional view because they were based on that view, and accepted its assumptions uncritically as the point d'appui of his analysis. Deutsch and Singer hoped to shore up the traditional view by presenting two lines of argument. First, they held that an increase in number of states yields an increase in interaction opportunities which tends to weaken those role-sets tending to conflictual behavior. Second, they held that an increase in number means that a state can only devote a smaller percentage of its attention to another; without a certain minimal amount of attention directed to it a conflict cannot develop. Let us begin with the first argument: As additional actors are brought into the system, the range of possible interactions open to each-and hence to the total sys- tem-increases. In economics, this accretion produces the trans- formation from barter to market, and in any social setting it produces a comparable increase in the range and flexibility of possible interactions. Traditionally, social scientists have be- lieved-and observed-that as the number of possible exchanges increases, so does the probability that the "invisible hand" of pluralistic interests will be effective. One might say that one of the greatest threats to the stability of any impersonal social system is the shortage of alternative partners. 64 The economic analogy has a questionable application here, for two reasons. First of all, the classical market model requires far more actors than have appeared in most historical multipolar international systems. An oligopolistic arrangement is a more appropriate analogy for these systems, and oligopolistic situations are much less subject to prediction, in the shape of the "invisible hand," than are classical markets. Further, what would be the political equivalent to the outcome of the operation 4 Karl W. Deutsch and J. David Singer, "Multipolar Power Systems and International Stability," World Politics, XVI, No. 3 (April, 1964), p. 394.</page><page sequence="25">JOHN J. WELTMAN 325 of the economic "invisible hand?" The authors seem to assume that this would necessarily take the form of a low level of violence. Why this should be so is not made quite clear. The second argument for the greater stability of a multipower system turns on the percentage of its attention a state is able to devote to any one other state. As the number of other states go up, the authors believe, this percentage must go down. Given an incipient conflict, a certain minimal percentage of the state's attention must be devoted to it if conflictual behavior is to result. If there is so much other traffic competing for the state's attention that it cannot devote even this degree of its attention to the question at issue, conflict will not occur. 65 Unfortunately, starting from the same premises, the opposite con- clusion is at least as plausible. As the number of states rises it would become progressively more difficult for a state to receive a clear message about anything, and thus to respond in an organized way; the incidence of violence would rise, violence growing out of chance or chaotic contacts, miscalculations, and misunderstandings. Although the question of number of actors was not crucial to Richard Rosecrance's conclusions in Action and Reaction in World Politics, he has had occasion to examine the question at a later date. 66 He surveys the scholarly controversy, and finds both sides wanting. The most stable international arrangement is neither bipolar nor multipolar, but something in between, a condition he calls "bimultipolarity." Rosecrance believes that the periodic encounters which would occur in the bipolar system would prove destabilizing, contrary to Waltz's view of their relative safety due to the unimportance of the stakes. 67 Rosecrance accepts the general view put forward by Deutsch and Singer, but with important qualifications. He suggests that a multipolar system would probably "increase the number of international conflicts, though it may possibly reduce their significance." 68 Furthermore, he accepts the argument for instability through incalculability in a multi- polar situation, 69 a principal mainstay of those who favor the two- power arrangement as the more benign. In Rosecrance's favored arrangement, which is composed of two superpowers surrounded by many smaller states not significantly tied to 65 Ibid., pp. 398 and 400. 66 R. N.

The multipolar element would mitigate conflict between the great powers; the latter's ordering influence would limit the effects of conflict among the smaller states.70 The conclusions Rosecrance draws with respect to the tendencies of the two types of system are arbitrary. He accepts some points previous writers have made and dismisses others, without specifying his criteria for choice. When the two types are combined in his hybrid system, we are given no reason why their respective tendencies toward stability- rather than their opposite tendencies to instability-should prove dom- inating in the total mix. Those who have attempted to use systems theory to settle the controversy surrounding international stability have not provided com- pelling arguments, but have merely rehearsed positions presented earl- ier. The basic arguments on both sides antedate their assimilation into a systemic formulation, and the approach has not gone beyond these arguments to provide a means for choosing between them. III "System" has been employed in two senses in the literature discussed here. In one usage, "system" does not help to generate new knowledge, but rather conceals the origin of those conclusions which are reached. In the other, its meaning is so broad as to make the assumption of its existence a precondition for any sort of scientific enterprise whatever. This broad meaning has been often found useful by systems theorists in defending their approach. Kaplan provides an example: If the number, type, and behavior of nations differ over time, and if their military capabilities, their economic assets, and their infor- mation also vary over time, then there is some likely interconnec- tion between these elements such that different structural and behavioral systems can be discerned to operate in different periods of history.... To conduct.... an investigation requires systemic hypotheses concerning the nature of the connection of the vari- ables.71 For Kaplan, the essence of the system is "interconnection." For 70 Ibid., p. 323. 7"Morton A.

WELTMAN 327 Easton the "fundamental meaning of system" is that "the interrelated parts tend to cohere." 72 Many other writers point to a similar under- standing of the term. Here the "system" stands for relatedness, for the existence of some sort of understandable pattern to the objects of examination. This usage is quite unexceptionable, but it does not meaningfully distinguish the activities of the systems theorist from other students of a subject-matter. Indeed, one cannot engage in any sort of investigation without assuming some sort of intelligible patterning in the objects of analysis. All social science must begin with a general assumption of interrelation in some sense or other; without this postulate the whole enterprise becomes meaningless. If system means only interrelation, systems theory loses any claim to uniqueness as a method for analyzing social events. Systems theory in this sense may be made subject to the critique which, as we have seen, Kingsley Davis developed against functionalism in sociology. That which is claimed as the method of one school lies in truth at the core of any attempt to render a subject-matter intelligible. If systems theory can successfully make a claim to uniqueness as a method for understanding politics, that claim can only follow from another understanding of the approach, a usage much narrower and more precise, a usage, furthermore, which clearly reflects the holistic outlook of systems theory's parentage. Such an outlook, spoken or unspoken, is indeed the only thing which saves systems theory from triviality. The rescue is not accomplished without casualties, however; holistic assumptions in the natural and social sciences have been more and more found useless or misleading in the modern period, and their employment has been increasingly avoid- ed. Systems theory has not been able to avoid the difficulties which others have found attending the use of holistic concepts in science; indeed the results we have examined in this essay provide a classic example of the pitfalls accompanying their employment. *When "system" is used centrally in the analysis, the temptation to reify it becomes very powerful. What is known already, and what is yet to be known, become mixed up. The larger outlines of the system and its operations are not known; the hope is merely that it may be possible to approach their understanding through the use of the method. But since the concept is employed so centrally, this fact becomes forgotten. The system is treated as a real, known quantity. It becomes seemingly possible to talk precisely, and in concrete fashion, about its attributes. 72 David Easton, The Political System (New York, 1953), p. 291.</page><page sequence="28">328 SYSTEMS THEORY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Since the systemic model assumes a precise and rigorously statable relation between the parts and the whole, and assigns a similarly concrete meaning to state and purpose descriptions, it is assumed that the system as manifested in reality is understood at a similar level. Nothing in the systems analysis, however, provides us with the content of these systemic attributes. This is why systems writers must resort to outside assumptions, and must assume by definition the existence of the conditions of which they speak. At best the role of the theory in this procedure is a neutral one, in which ideas are translated from one language into another. At worst it serves to mislead us as to the process by which conclusions are generated, and to facilitate the transformation of subjective attitudes and anthropomorphic projections into supposedly rigorous terminology. For the message of systems theory can only be rescued from banality by an implicit acceptance of General Systems Theory's most far-reach- ing claim. I mean the view that teleological questions can be now transferred from the metaphysical to the scientific, that the idea of the "open" system provides the link whereby "purposive" activity may be imputed to non-human entities and described with the same objectivity as simple movements or interactions. We have seen, however, that this view rests ultimately on a misuse of terms. If physics has long dealt with "random" complexity, and General Systems Theory now proposes to deal with "organized" complexity, this still does not mean that "organized" is the converse of "random" in the precise sense necessary to establish the claim. "Random" has a precise mathematical meaning. "Organized" does not entail any such equation, and may be used to describe vaguely a wide variety of states. If this view is accepted, science must return to an agnostic position with regard to such aspects of systemic "organization" as appear intuitively to resemble purposive activity in man. As systems theory cannot return to this position without losing its intellectual identity, its claims finally can only appear valid through the operation of one of the oldest of man's intellectual delusions, the anthropomorphic fallacy. Systems theory as an approach to the study of international relations is in the unfortunate position of falling between two stools. The concept of "system" has progressed from a contentless convenience within the context of sociological theories emphasizing other ideas, to a holistic ontology. This development has meant the progressive confus- ion of a metaphor for an explanation. We do not mean that this progression has been uniform; for many writers, the system is no more than a convenient shorthand term subsuming, but not describing or analyzing, a body of data. It is used metaphorically to evoke a general-</page><page sequence="29">JOHN J. WELTMAN 329 ized but essentially contentless image of an interrelation whose inter- stices are to be the object of later investigation. Others, however, have made holistic presumptions in an implicit or explicit fashion, demon- strating the influence of General Systems Theory. The metaphor now takes on the attributes of the concrete and is made a term in explana- tory statements. In either its holistic or non-holistic fashion, however, the explanatory value of the idea of system is limited. In the former manifestation, the difficulty is obvious. Systemic "explanation" ultimately depends on concepts which cannot be approached through empirical investigation. In the latter, the idea of "system" is no more useful. The idea becomes equivalent to the idea of intelligibility itself. Systems theory of this sort cannot provide a unique aid to research, since it ceases to be a distinguishable outlook. A method of analysis proceeding to draw conclusions only from those applications which have been made of the approach to date is of course subject to question. Systems theory may have more to offer than the efforts to date have yet demonstrated. But a decade and more has now passed since the first explicit application of the approach to international relations was published. During that time scholars of considerable reputation have attempted to demonstrate its utility. If they have not succeeded, further claims for it must be viewed, not as imaginative judgements of future utility, but as confessions of faith.</page></plain_text>
