<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-1995 For Ernesto De Miro on his seventieth birthday The administrative state of flux of which I wrote at the start of both my last two reports (AR 1981-82 84; 1988-89 105) has at last begun to subside, as Sicily settles down to the luxury, unknown in the Italian peninsula, of having a separate Soprin- tendenza for each provincia. To the six created in 1987 were added that of Enna in 1989 and one for Caltanissetta on 1st January 1992; only a distinct Soprintendenza for Ragusa province is not yet in place as I write, although its creation is said to be imminent. Each of the fledgling Soprintendenze has continued to grow and mature as more staff and technical support have been acquired, and the result has undoubtedly been an explosion in the rate of archaeological activity. Such, however, is the pace of fresh discoveries and the pressures on the handful of Ispettori e Ispettrici to start on yet another project before the last one is properly finished, that one wonders how much of it will ever get published beyond the briefest of summaries. All this makes the job for the compiler of AR that much harder. Quite apart from the need now to visit the headquarters of eight separate Soprintendenze to garner information, the proliferation of local publications of Quaderni, Cataloghi di mostre and Atti di giorni di studi, which rarely get disseminated outside Sicily, makes even the tracking down of the barest bibliographical details more and more difficult. On top of that, the number of excavations that are taking place which do not even receive the briefest of notes is undoubtedly growing. The fear expressed in AR 1987-88 106, that AR might be the only record of the existence of some of this work, has been fulfilled: I have now seen instances in print where AR is cited by Sicilian scholars for an excavation that is otherwise totally unpublished. There are of course some notable excep- tions where work is being written up in full, and they are duly noted below; but they constitute a tiny minority of the excava- tions which take place each year. Given the shortage of trained personnel and the absence of any clear post-excavation strategy, it is hard to see how this situation is likely to change in the forseeable future. The challenges facing Sicilian archaeology are therefore enormous, and they are complicated by excessive bureaucratic obstacles (which have increased in the climate of 'mani pulite') and also the vested interests of the anti-archaeology lobby. Spare a thought for the personal sacrifices that two archae- ological Soprintendenti have had to make since I wrote my last Report: the incarceration of Giuseppe Voza at Syracuse on a trumped-up charge of knowingly destroying archaeological deposits without record, and the placing under house arrest for a fortnight of Graziella Fiorentini at Agrigento, again on a trumped-up charge, all because of her relentless and cour- ageous crusade to prevent building without planning permission ('costruzione abusiva') in the un-built-up area of the ancient city (cf. Archaeology 1996, May/June 1996, 6). That such scholars manage to find the time to achieve as much as they do when facing monstrous obstacles in their work (including threats to their personal safety) is a tribute to their passione, courage and diplomacy, and to their sheer determination to move forward our knowledge of Sicilian archaeology against the odds, and where possible to protect sites and monuments for posterity. Because of the huge expansion of archaeological activity the unenviable task for the compiler of AR has become truly herculean. Gone now are my optimistic attempts to provide the comprehensive coverage at which I aimed in AR 1981-82 and 1987-88. Given constraints of space and above all time in a hectic life of administration, teaching and other research commitments, this Report is inevitably more partial and uneven than I would like it to have been; but keeping control of the ever increasing flood of publications on all aspects of Sicilian archaeology is becoming a truly daunting task. Nevertheless, mindful that many Sicilian publications are not widely diffused throughout the libraries of the world (and certainly not the English-speaking world), I have continued to try and present as many references to recent books and articles as I can, in the belief that they serve as useful signposts to the literature, guiding the reader to items which might otherwise escape detection. In writing this Report I have received assistance from many friends and colleagues in Sicily and beyond, and I am very grateful to them all for giving me a generous measure of their time, knowledge and expertise. I am particularly indebted to the following for the gift of books, which eased the task of preparing this Report in Nottingham, including G. Castellana and G. Fiorentini (Agrigento), F. De Angelis (British School at Rome), S.L. Agnello, F. Giudice and F. Valenti (Catania), T. Fischer-Hansen (Copenhagen), R. Leighton (Edinburgh), G.M. Bacci and E. De Miro (Messina), J.A. De Waele (Nijmegen), M. Bound (Oxford), O. Belvedere, N. Bonacasa, R.M. Bona- casa Carra, F.S. Brancato, C.A. Di Stefano, A. Tullio, S. Tusa, V. Tusa and A. Villa (Palermo), G. Nenci (Pisa) and A. Precopi Lombardo (Trapani). Offprints have kindly been sent or given to me by these scholars and by G. Di Stefano (Camarina), R.M. Albanese Procelli, G. Lamagna and G. Manganaro (Catania), W. Schurmann (Karlsruhe), D.J.L. Gibbins (Liverpool), A. Johnston (London), B.E. McConnell (Medford, Massachusetts), G. Scibona (Messina), J. Johns and G. Shepherd (Oxford), N. Allegro, A. Cutroni Tusa, G. Falsone, A. Giamellaro Spano and F. Spatafora (Palermo) and M. Fama (Trapani) and H.P. Isler (Zurich). Others who have helped me in addition to all of the above include A.J. Parker (Bristol), M.G. Branciforte, F. Privitera and G. Rizza (Catania), U. Spigo and G. Tigano (Messina), J. May (Nottingham), S. Vassallo (Palermo), G. Kapitan (Syracuse) and R. Camerata Scovazzo and I. Valenti (Trapani). I am particularly grateful to Dr Alan Johnston for comparing notes with me after the last Palermo conference, in the hope of achieving fuller and more accurate coverage of the proceedings in advance of publication of the Atti than would otherwise have been the case. I also acknowledge with gratitude the generous hospitality that the following of my Sicilian friends extended to me while I was collecting information for this Report: Ernesto De Miro, Graziella Fiorentini, Gioacchino Falsone, Filippo Giudice and Giacomo Scibona. It gives me particular pleasure to dedicate this Sicilian miscellany to Ernesto De Miro, whose friendship and wise counsel over many years I have deeply appreciated, and whose kindness has helped make my own work in Sicily a series of such memorable and pleasurable experiences. His contribution to Sicilian archaeology has been enormous, and the number of 'new' archaeological sites, starting with Herac- lea Minoa in 1950, which he has been responsible for opening up, is truly astonishing: of him it can literally be said, si monumentum requiris, circumspice... Finally I owe a debt of gratitude for a grant from the Research Committee of the University of Nottingham, which helped pay some of the expenses incurred in preparing this Report, including a visit to Sicily in 1995. Last but far from least Dr Lyn Rodley has been once again the most accommo- dating and patient of editors: her admirable ability to mix skill, diplomacy and forebearance is truly mirabile dictu.</page><page sequence="2">60 R. J. A. WILSON INTRODUCTION For anyone interested in Sicilian archaeology the Palermo conferences have long been and still remain an invaluable starting-point; but as I warned in my last Report (AR 1987-88 106), the sheer pace of research and the amount of archaeologi- cal activity, which has increased beyond all recognition over the past two decades, mean that the format of the conference no longer provides the right forum for anything more than the barest summary of the work undertaken by the Soprintendenze. Unfortunately no alternative has taken its place: some work is presented in Mostre and in numerous Convegni which are organised locally on specific themes, and the results of these, when published (see below), are extremely valuable records of research. The Atti of the 1988 conference finally appeared in 1994, although regrettably without any report from the eastern Sicilian Soprintendenze; but the proceedings of the next conference, which took place in 1993 (after a five-year gap rather than the previous four-year one), are appearing in print rather more rapidly (Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94], of which vols. I.1, 1.2 and II.1 have appeared so far). The last (published in mid-summer 1996) contains reports on the work of the Agrigento, Catania and Messina Soprintendenze between 1988 and 1993. The main theme of the conference was "'Nostoi' and 'emporia': la Sicilia come punto di riferimento fino al VI sec. a.C.", which allowed speakers to explore contacts between Sicily and other parts of the Mediterranean world in archaic times and earlier, including Africa (L. Braccesi, M. Fantar), Phoenicia (M.G. Guzzo Amadasi), Greece (A.W. Johnston, S. Banchetti, S.N. Consolo Langher), Iberia (E. Sanmarti-Griego) and Gaul (J.-P. Morel) (Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 9-395). Meanwhile, other smaller conferences have also found publica- tion in the pages of Kokalos; one on the Carthaginian eparch- eia in Sicily, for example (Kokalos 36-37 [1990-91, publ. 1994], 163-265), and another on earthquakes and their possible effect on late Roman Sicily (ibid. 269-386; contrast Wilson, Sicily, 185-7; and for eruptions of Etna in the 2nd Ct BC, see N. Berti in M. Sordi, ed., Fenomeni naturali e avvenimenti storici nell'antichita [Milan 1989] 87). Among Sicilian learned journals Kokalos, as well as the long-established Sicilia Archeologia (of very variable quality), and the more ephemeral Bollettino Culturali Ambientali Sicilia (BCASiiclia), have for some time been the principal organs for disseminating Sicilian archaeological news and research. In recent years they have been joined by a number of other periodical publications which contain archaeological articles. The most important, which has now established itself as one of the leading Sicilian archaeological journals, is Quaderni dell'Istituto di archeologia...della Universita di Messina (QuadMess), but others which have joined them more recently are Kalos: arte in Sicilia (Palermo: Edizioni Ariete, 6 times yearly); Quaderni dell'attivita didattica del museo regionale di Messina (Messina, 1 [1991] - ; volume 2 [1992] is entirely dedicated to archaeology); Quaderni del museo archeologico regionale "Antonino Salinas" (Palermo, 1 [1995] - ); and the more ephemeral Demetra (the volume for 1991 carries an account by Professor M. Bell on his excavations at Morgan- tina); and L'Embasi , published twice a year at Militello di Catania (issue 2 has a publication by M.G. Branciforte of Orsi's previously unpublished fieldwork in the territory of Militello). Two new periodicals have also come from the same Istituto di Storia antica at Palermo University that begat Kokalos. One is Seia [Quaderni dell'Istituto di Storia antica] 1 (1984- ), which publishes small monographs each year on different ancient historical themes (e.g. 6 [1989, but publ. 1993] was on an aspect of Sicilian Roman epigraphy: F.P. Rizzo, La menzione del lavoro nelle epigrafi della Sicilia antica: per una storia della mentalita); and the other is MYOO: Rivista di storia delle religioni 1 (1989)- , with usually at least one item on Sicilian ancient religion in each issue. The most useful single-volume contribution on aspects of Sicilian archaeology as a whole to have been published in the last few years is undoubtedly that of T. Fischer-Hansen (ed.), Ancient Sicily [= Acta Hyperborea 5] (Copenhagen 1995), pp. 316 (hereafter Fischer-Hansen, Sicily), with eleven articles, all published in English, from a variety of hands, on topics ranging from Neolithic to Roman. Some of these contributions will be mentioned in the appropriate place below. We may also note the general survey of R. Ross Holloway, The archaeology of ancient Sicily (London 1991), with a full and useful bibli- ography covering the years 1980 to 1989; this disappointing work, however, which will doubtless be widely used by students as an introduction to the complexities of Sicilian archaeology, is a volume to handle with considerable care (cf. my review in JHS 114 [1994] 217). A work of a very different kind is the excellent Festschrift for the former Soprintendente, Vincenzo Tusa, edited by J. De la Geniere, Dieter Mertens and others, under the title Studi sulla Sicilia Occidentale in onore di Vincenzo Tusa (Padua 1993), pp. 380. Unlike other recent Sicilian examples of this genre, the contributors were selected by the editors and restricted to Tusa's pupils and collaborators; the result is a focussed and self-contained volume with many items of lasting value on the archaeology of western Sicily (hereafter Studi Tusa). Of great importance for the study of the same part of Scily is the powerful spotlight which has been turned on the Elymians in recent years, the outcome of happy collaboration between the Palermo and Trapani Soprintendenze and the inspirational and energetic direction of Vincenzo Tusa and latterly Giuseppe Nenci. This has resulted in three import- ant conferences which presented a wealth of fresh evidence, but because the first conference in 1989 was organised under different auspices, and the second conference in 1991 was called the first, and has a slightly different title, there is room for bibliographical confusion. To resolve this I have abbrevi- ated the title of the first conference's proceedings (for the full titles, see the list of abbreviations given on the inside back cover) to Gli Elimi, and called the publication of the 1991 conference Atti Elimi I. A follow-up conference to the latter was held at Gibellina in 1994, but its proceedings are not yet published (Atti Elimi II, forthcoming). Nor do these volumes by any means exhaust the list of significant works which have appeared in the last few years. There is much food for thought, for example, in G.R. Tsetskhl- adze and F. De Angelis (eds.), The archaeology of Greek colonisation: essays dedicated to Sir John Boardman [Oxford University Committee for Archaeology Monograph 40] (Oxford 1994), pp. 149, a collection of essays, all of the highest quality, but these range of course much more widely than Sicily alone; and the same is true both of a 1991 conference proceedings, Les Grecs et I'Occident: actes du Colloque de la villa 'Kery- tos' (Rome 1995) and of another welcome multi-author work which will long remain essential reading on the Western Greeks, J-P. Descoeudres (ed.), Greek colonists and native populations (Canberra and Oxford 1990, pp. 664). Among other general books more specifically on Sicilian archaeology, the late Georges Vallet's Sicilia greca (Milan 1990), pp. 145, is basically a picture-book with short introductory text and rambling guide through the main localities; there is also a section on the coins by A. Stazio. Another photographic treat with scholarly accompanying texts is E. Gabba et al., Sicilia</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 dal cielo: le citta antiche (Catania: G. Maimone, 1994), pp. 253. A painstaking review of the evidence for Greek colonisation in the A period can be found in the 2-volume survey of A.J. Dominguez, La colonizaci6n griega en Sicilia: Griegos, Indigenas y Punicas en la Sicilia arcaica: interaccion y acculturacion [British Archaeological Reports International series 549] (Oxford 1989), while we may also note the handsome catalogue of the exhibition arranged by the comune of Partinico which was shown at Malmo in Sweden, La Sicilia greca/Det Grekiska Sicilien (Palermo 1989), with texts (notwithstanding its title) in English and Italian: this gives a good cross-section of finds from all over Sicily (especially those discovered in the last two decades) dating from between the 8th and the 4th Ct BC, with the usual accompanying introductory essays. More limited in scope, in that it only covers the province of Palermo, but valuable for its wealth of detail and full descriptive and illustrative catalogue of exhibits, is the handsome volume Di terra in terra: nuove scoperte archeologiche nella provincia di Palermo (Palermo: Museo archeologico regionale, 1993), pp. 316. But the tour de force on the exhibition front is the massive blockbuster with nearly a thousand individual exhibits which is being shown at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice during 1996, the magnificently produced catalogue of which, published in somewhat wooden English as G. Pugliese Carratelli, ed., The Western Greeks: classical civilization in the Western Mediterranean (London 1996, pp. 800, with an astonishing 1,600 illustrations of which many are in colour), will serve as a major reference work and textbook for teaching the subject long after the exhibition itself has been dismantled (hereafter Western Greeks). On Sicilian prehistory S. Tusa's standard work, La Sicilia nella preistoria, originally published in 1983, has been reissued in a substantially enlarged and updated edition (Palermo: Sellerio, 1992, pp. 718), while for the more faint-hearted he has also written a much shorter introductory synthesis, Sicilia preistorica, with lovely colour illustrations (Palermo: Flac- covio, 1994, pp. 220). He is also the editor of another substan- tial volume, a collection of conference papers presenting recent work on Sicilian prehistory, especially in western Sicily (S. Tusa, ed., La preistoria del basso Belice e della Sicilia nel quadro della preistoria siciliana e Mediterranea, Palermo: Societa siciliana per la storia patria and Istituto di Archeologia, Universita di Palermo, 1994, pp. 505), which will be required reading for all Sicilian prehistorians. Another very welcome development is the recent publication, in the Accordia Research Centre's 'Specialist Studies on Italy' series, of R. Leighton, ed., Early societies in Sicily: new developments in archaeologi- cal research (London 1996), with 16 stimulating papers by the younger generation of Sicilian prehistorians. Right up to date, it gives both valuable syntheses of various aspects of Sicilian prehistory, and reports on recent important excavations, at Santa Febronia, Sant'Angelo Muxaro and elsewhere. The papers (nine of which are in English, enhancing its accessibility to British undergraduates) provide a timely indication of just how much is happening in Sicilian prehistory today. There are also useful brief surveys of the present state of knowledge of Neolithic and MBA Sicily by E. Procelli in Fischer-Hansen, Sicily,13, and of the LBA and IA by R.M. Albanese Procelli (ibid. 33); and another broad sweep, by C. Malone, S. Stoddart and R. Whitehouse, setting the Sicily of 2000-800 BC in its wider south Italian (and Maltese) context (in C. Matthers and S. Stoddart, eds., Development and decline in the Mediterra- nean Bronze Age [Sheffield 1994] 167). More significantly, we should also note Dr R. Leighton's important discussion of later prehistoric and protohistoric chronology, in which he proposes changes in the traditional LBA/IA chronology, lowering the end-date for Cassibile culture (traditionally 1050-850) to c. 800, and allowing overlap with Pantalica Sud culture, traditionally c. 850-750 but which in fact should itself extend down into the early 7th Ct (Cam- bridge Archaeological Journal 3 [1993] 271). This new chronology seems to be meeting with general acceptance (cf. also L. Maniscalco and B.E. McConnell, Colloquenda Mediter- ranea 2 [1993] 43, a propos the chronology proposed in the controversial P. James et al., Centuries of darkness, London 1991). Among other general studies of Sicilian prehistory, we may note a prehistoric miscellany published under a somewhat misleading title as La Preistoria in Sicilia [Quademi di Sicilia Archeologica 1] (Trapani n.d. but 1987) and E. Burgio et al., La Sicilia prima della storia (Palermo 1990). On the Phoenicians in Sicily there have been various recent works of synthesis, either dealing exclusively with Sicily, such as the handsome picture book of U. La Rosa (with 99 mostly colour photographs by V. La Rosa), I Fenici in Sicilia (Palermo 1989, pp. 178) or as part of wider works such as E. Acquaro, Gli insediamentifenici e punici in Italia ((Rome: Libreria dello Stato, 1988), 9-43 or id., M.E. Aubet and M.H. Fantar, Insediamenti fenici e punici nel Mediterraneo occidentale [Itinerari XIII] (Rome: Libreria dello Stato, 1993), 79-101. A review of the current state of Punic studies in Sicily can be found in V. Tusa's contribution to Atti del II Congresso internazionale di Studifenici e punici (Rome 1991), 217-28, a volume which contains several other studies relevant to Phoenicio-Punic Sicily. For later periods there has been much interest shown recently in the history of the Sicilian tyrannies, especially that of Dionysius I, the subject of no less than three monographs in recent years: M. Sordi, La Dynasteia in occidente (Studi su Dionisi I) (Editoriale Programma: Padova 1992, pp. 173), L.J. Sanders, Dionysius I of Syracuse and Greek Sicily (London, Croom Helm 1987, pp. 189) (cf. also id., Historia 40 [1991] 278) and B. Caven, Dionysius I, warlord of Sicily (Yale: New Haven and London 1990, pp. 272); but earlier and later tyrannies have also come under the spotlight, as in T. van Compernolle, L'influence de la politique des Deinomenides et des Eumenides sur l'architecture et l'urbanisme siceliotes (Louvain 1992) (prolegomena in Antiquite classique 58 [1989] 44); N. Luraghi, Tirannidi arcaiche in Sicilia e Magna Grecia. Da Panezio di Leontini alla caduta dei Deinomenidi (Florence 1994); and D.P. Orsi, La lotta politica a Siracusa alla meta del 4. secolo a.C. (Bari 1994). J.A. Krasilnikoff has pondered the power base of the Sicilian tyrants (especially Dionysius) and concluded that the fundamental power-regulating mechanisms were the control of neighbouring populations, the introduction of foreigners, especially as mercenaries, and a militarisation of the Syracusan polis (Fischer-Hansen, Sicily, 171). On mercenaries there is now G. Tagliamonte, I figli di Marte: mobilita, mercenarii e mercenario italici in Magna Grecia e Sicilia (Rome 1994), pp. 294, which in addition to expoiting fully the historical sources discusses archaeological and epigraphic evidence for the presence of mercenaries, such as Campanians at Entella and Nakone (the Entella decrees), belts and helmets from Morgantina, Monte Casale and else- where, a bronze weight from Camarina and Oscan inscriptions in Messina. Evidence for Spanish mercenaries serving in the Carthaginian armies in Sicily is considered by P. Barcado in Atti II Congresso internazionale di studi fenici e punici (Rome 1991), 21-6. On other historical themes, notable monographs have appeared on the Athenian expedition to Syracuse (S. Cataldi, 61</page><page sequence="4">62 R. J. A. WILSON Pious es sikelia: ricerche sulla seconda spedizione ateniense in Sicilia [Alessandria 1992], pp. 123); cultural interaction in the 4th Ct BC (A.C. Cassio and D. Musti, eds., Tra Sicilia e Magna Graecia: aspetti di interazione culturale nel 4. sec. a.C. Atti del convegno Napoli 19-20 marzo 1987 (Rome: Edizioni dell'Ateneo, 1989, pp. 223); and E. Galvagno and C. Mole Ventura (eds.), Mito, storia, tradizione. Diodoro Siculo e la storiografia classica [Testi e studi di storia antica 1] (Catania: Edizioni del Prisma), pp. 396, of which pp. 91-269 specifically concern res sicilianae. The collected writings of the late Eugenio Manni, whose death has dealt an incalculable blow to the study of ancient history in Sicily, have been published as E. Manni, Sikelika kai Italika: scritti minori di storia antica della Sicilia e dell'Italia meridionale [Supplemento a Kokalos 8] (Rome 1990), 2 vols., pp. viii + 980; and the series founded by him which attempts to provide convenient collections of the ancient sources on specific periods of Sicilian history marches on with R. Marino, La Sicilia dal 241 al 210 a.C. [Testimonia Siciliae antiquae 1.12] (Rome 1988), pp. 215. Among other topics in vogue, the subject of Sicilian grain has been the focus of a number of studies by the Pisa school: L. Gallo on the relevance of western Sicily for Rome's grain supply (ASNP 22 [1992] 365; cf. also id., in Istituto universita- ria orientale: annali. Sezione di archeologia e storia antica 11 [1989] 31), on the role of Agrigento as a grain supplier in the classical period (G. Nenci, ASNP3 23 [1993), 1], and on the export of Sicilian grain to Greece (U. Fantasia, ibid. 9). Sicilian grain in a rather later period also gets consideration by G. Manganaro (in Ravitaillement en ble, 261, considering the Scily-Marseilles trade route) and E. Deniaux (ibid. 243, examining from the Ciceronian evidence the occasions on which the price of grain was lowered thanks to the generosity of the Sicilians). On town planning there is a stimulating and penetrating contribution by T. Fischer-Hansen on the earliest town-plan- ning in Sicily, with special reference to Gela (not hitherto accorded such prominence), but discussing also eight other sites. Inter alia he stresses the paramount importance of town-plannig to the earliest settlers, and suggests that different orientations in layout may be as much due to different ethnic groups within the populations as to morphological consider- ations; he also emphasizes the early fondness for laying-out per strigas (in M.H. Hansen, ed., Introduction to an inventory of Poleis. Symposium August 23-26 1995 [Acts of the Copenhagen Polis Centre 3], Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences and Letters, Historisk-filosofiske Meddelelser 74, Copenhagen 1996, 317). A. Wasowicz has also outlined the distinctive characteristics of western urban planning, and also stressed the partiality for layouts per strigas (Journal of ancient topography 2 [1992] 9-22). Other aspects of architecture have also been the subject of recent review. Theatres are the subject of a study by K. Mitens (Teatri greci e teatri ispirati all'architecttura greca in Sicilia e nell'Italia meridionale c. 350-50 a.C. [= Analecta Romana Instituti Danici Supplementum XIII (Rome 1988)], which provides a useful catalogue of theatres, their plans and bibliography, but is insufficiently critical of the traditional chronologies for these buildings, the dates of which often rest on very slender evidence (or none at all). There has also been a separate monograph on the narrower topic of theatre scene buildings (C. Courtois, Le bdtiment de scene des thedtres d'Italie et de Sicile [Archaeologia Transatlantica 8], Louvain and Providence 1989), while C. Buckler has looked again at the evidence for the traditional reconstructions of the theatre scene buildings at Segesta (by Bulle) and at Tindari (by Bernab6 Brea) and concluded that both should be two-storey rather than three (Archiologischer Anzeiger 1992, 277). Other building-types to have been the subject of recent review are Greek monumental altars in the West, by Dr D. Mertens of the DAI, Rome (in R. Etienne and M-T. Le Dinahet, eds., L'esp- ace sacrificiel dans les civilisations mediterran&amp;ennes de l'antiquite [Paris 1991] 187); the peculiarities and distinctive- ness of western Greek stoas, by Professor M. Bell (in R.T. Scott and A. Reynolds Scott, eds., Eius Virtutis Studiosi: classical and postclassical studies in memory of Frank Edward Brown [Studies in History of Art 43. Symposium Papers XXIII], Hannover and London 1993, 327); and we now have an excellent, in-depth and up-to-date review of Sicilian defensive circuits in L. Karlsson, Fortification towers and masonry techniques in the hegemony of Syracuse, 405-201 BC (Stockholm 1992), pp. 125 (cf. also in brief id., Opuscula romana 17 [1989] 77). For private housing, there is the valuable study by Anne Cordsen of archaic Greek pastas houses in Sicily (at Megara Hyblaea, Naxos, Monte San Mauro and Agrigento) (in Fischer-Hansen, Sicily, 103): clearly designed as prestige dwellings by owners with a social message to convey, they nevertheless never became as widespread in Sicily in the classical period as they were in mainland Greece. The water supply, both private and public, has come under scrutiny in an erratic and idiosyncratic book by D.P. Crouch, Water management in ancient Greek cities (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 380), which is heavily laden with Sicilian examples, an island the author knows well: there is much here of relevance to Sicilian aquatic arrangements, especially at Syracuse, Gela, Agrigento and Morgantina (cf. also ead., Mitteilungen. Leichtweiss-Institut fiir Wasserbau der Technischen Universitdt Braunschweig 103 [1989] 153 for a study of Agrigento and Morgantina). On sanctuaries there is a probing and detailed survey of archaic temenoi in the West by B. Berquist in A. Schachter (ed.), Le sanctuaire grec [Entretiens Hardt XXXVII] (Geneva 1992] 109), while A. Siracusano has surveyed the evidence for the use of Doric in Sicilian temples, not just the big examples but the small-scale naiskoi as well (QuadMess 4 [1989, publ. 1991] 51), and I. Romeo has made a penetrating and detailed analysis of archaic non-peripteral temples in Sicily (Xenia 17 [1989] 5). There is also much to ponder in La Magna Grecia e i grandi santuari della madrepatria, the Atti of the 31st Taranto conference held in 1991 (Taranto: Istituto per la storia e l'archeologia della Magna Grecia, bearing a titular date of 1992, but in fact published in 1995). A new initiative on necropolises has been launched by Juliette De La Geniere (ASNP3 16 [1986] 977), and shows signs already of bearing considerable fruit (see below, on Entella and Selinus), and cemeteries are also the focus of current research by Dr Gillian Shepherd, to be published as a monograph by Cambridge University Press; she has studied archaic burial customs at Syracuse, Megara Hyblaea and Gela, and demon- strated (in Fischer-Hansen, Sicily, 51) that each, far from imitating those of the mother-city, displayed a striking indepen- dence of approach from the start. In sculpture a major landmark for the Severe Style was the exhibition organised by the Palermo Museum, the catalogue of which, Lo stile severo in Sicilia: dall'apogeo della tirannide alla prima democrazia (Palermo: Universita di Palermo and Museo archeologico regionale, 1990, pp. 380), will be a work of lasting value. The same goes also for the proceedings of an international conference on the same theme held at the time of the exhibition, published as N.

Ross Holloway has also looked at aspects of early classical sculpture, reckons the Motya youth is Selinuntine work, and even boldly suggests that the Riace bronzes originally stood in a Sicilian city and were only dumped off the Italian coast in modern times (Nm171isw71nat- icaC e ( tntichiti classiche 17 11988] 55; Si(Arch xxi.66-68 11988] 23). This is put forward on the sonmewhat dubious bases that because no ship was found with the statues no ancient (supposed R) wreck existed, and that no 5th Ct BC Gr work is likely to have been standing in a Gr city by the times the Romans arrived in the 3rd Ct BC, because every one had been earlier sacked and looted by Carthage. (How then did these survive? And in any case has Holloway not heard of Verres?) One hopes that this idea, proclaimed also in his book (Ar(hcue- ology of 1('aciCent Si('i/ 11991] 109), does not becoime wide- spread currency. Of works in terracotta, the Sicilian architectural pieces, recently reappraised by C. Wikander (AR 1987-88 109), have now been treated in fresh detail by Nancy Winter (Grceek (Irr'hitC('tltull terracoi(otti.s fi'oi the /Ire'lhistori( to the endc of' the ir'hali(' Ieriod IOxford 19931 273-84, cf. 288-91 ), but without. unfortunately, sufficient accompanying illustration. The little house-altairs which are a characteristic of the West also continue to attract their fair share of attention: an exhaustive monograph on them has appeared, H. van der Meijden, TeIrriakotta-arllle ailt Sizilien 1111d U1nte'it(llieCn (Amsterldaml 1993), pp. 394, and they were also the focus of a confer-ence at Naxos at which an altai- depicting a sphinx either side of a double scroll volute, found by chance in 1972, was reunited with a smnaller fragment of the same altar in the collections ol the University of Heidelberg. A total of 40 altars were assembled flor the exhibition arranged to mark the occasion, and papei-s were delivered about portable clay altars fi-om Naxos, Himera, Monte Saraceno, the Gela wreck and else- where. The resulting publication, M.C. Lentini (ed.), Unru11't1ilt ti- Heidelberg e Nu.vo.s (Naxos 1993, pp. 142), is a pleasing permanent record of a successful event, and a most valuable repository of information about this class of arteftact. Terracotta statuettes oniom Sicily in general are the subject of consideraton by H. FroninL (Arclhiioloisclher Anz. eiger 1990() 337) and, for the HL period, by M. Bell (in J.P. Uhlenbrock, ed., The (oroi)lltsl(t s rll: lctil(ott(i.s of tlhe hellelistic w'orl1l [New Yor-k 199()1 64). who emphasizes the creative role and influence of Syracuse and Taranto on terracotta production at this time. It is also worth drawing attention here to one other most strikiin addition to the corpus of Sicilian terracotta sculpture, datable on grounds olf style (there is alas no other criterion) to the late archaic period ((. 52()/51() BC). In 1977 the Badische Landesmuseuml in Karlslruhe acquired a lifesize head of a wo01an.I its coloured paint still liesh and very well preserved. In 1986 twenty-one lurtherl fragments. for the most part joining, arrived at the mIuseum (Fig. I). and the now enlarged piece was seen f-om11 wines at the back to have been a Nike, probably part of a temple acroterion (Fig. 2). On the basis of style Gela seemis the most likely findspot (W. SchUirmann, JIuhrbuch dleri Stwlilhli(che l Kulsi.st.w.IInlll1hge(1 iln Bdc(lei-WiiI tteiiilbeI 25 19881 16).

WILSON reminders of the constant war being waged by the Sicilian (and Italian) archaeological authorities against the age-old activities of unscrupulous clandestini. On epigraphy, we have the reviews by A. Brugnone and L. Bivona of recent publications in Kokalos 39-40 (1993-94) 487- 514 and 515-27, not to mention the digests in SEC and AE; and only a few of the highlights, as well as some work published since 1993, can be included here. Perhaps the most useful initiative of the past few years is the systematic presen- tation of the A inscriptions of both Sicily and south Italy by R. Arena (Iscrizioni greche arcaiche di Sicilia e Magna Grecia), of which four volumes have appeared. The first (Milan 1989) dealt with Megara Hyblaia and Selinus, the second (Milan 1992) covered the inscriptions of Gela and Agrigento, and the third (Pisa 1994) treats the Euboean colonies, which in Sicily means Naxos, Zankle, Himera, Lentini and Katane (volume 4, 1996, concerns the Achaean colonies). Another invaluable compilation is L. Dubois, Inscriptions grecclues dialectales de Sicile [Collections Ecole francaise de Rome 119] (Rome 1989), pp. 305, although some of the readings there offered are controversial. A monograph with a narrower focus is M. Del Amor Lopez Jimeno, Las tabellas defi.iones de la Sicilia griega (Amsterdam: Hakkert 1991), pp. 269. Professor G. Manganaro (Catanai) continues to write copious and valuable articles on all aspects of Sicilian epigraphy. Among many studies, some mentioned in their proper place below, he has rounded up 91 stray pieces to publish or re-publish with new readings (Epigraphica 51 [19891 161); studied the phenomenon of metoikismos in Sicily (ASNP3 14 [1990] 391); grouped together a series of 'rustic' rock-cut inscriptions located in various parts of the Sicilian countryside (in L. Gasperini, ed., Rupes loquentes: atti del Convegno internalzionale di stludio sulle iscrizioni rupestri di et[t riomalllilii in Italia [Rome 19921 447); looked at the Greek/Latin divide in town and country in Roman Sicily (in A. Calli et al., L'epigrafia del villaggio [Epigrafia e antichiti 12], Faenza 1993, 543); and presented the texts with ilustrations of two dozen Gr inscriptions from E Sicily, mostly of Roman imperial date and already published (MEFRA 106 [19941 79). Dr M.L. Lazzarini has looked again at the small terracotta spheres with public inscriptions (phratry and other names on them) and suggets that they might have had a secondary use as catapult projectiles like lead glandes (in A. Storchi Marino, ed., L'incidenza dell'antico [Naples 19951 415). G. and W. Hornbostel have reported on a hitherto unpublished herald's staff (caduceus) of bronze from Olympia (in the Olympia museum), inscribed AA]MOYION EYPAKOEION, probably of the early 5th Ct BC, and compared it with an intact example with the same inscription (although with the words reversed) in Hamburg. A third example, so far unpublished, is reported to be in a Sicilian private collection (Bathron: Beitriige...fiir Heinrich Dreriiup [Saarbricken 1988] 233). In the pages of AR 1987-88 108, I predicted that debate about the famous Athens-Segesta alliance inscription (IG i3, I 1: is it a phi or not a phi in line 3?) was set 'to run and run': I have not been disappointed. M. Chambers, R. Gallucci and P. Spanos (ZPE 83 [19901 38) first looked at the stone with the aid of computer-enhanced photography and laser-beam technology, and were convinced that the name Antiphon could be read, so dating the stone to 418/7. This understandably prompted H.B. Mattingly to return to an inscription he first treated controversially 40 years ago (Proceedings of the Classical Association 54 [19571 31), re-examining the implica- tions for Greek epigraphy in general of such down-dating (Historia 41 [19921 129). But laser-beams are incapable, it seems, of settling the matter: A. Henry has leapt to the defence of the traditional dating (ZPE 91 [19921 137: cf. also Ancient Histor! Bulletin 7 [1993] 49) in a systematic rebuttal of Chambers et al., pointing out inter alia that what the photo- graphs are picking up are tiny fractures caused by the stone- cutter 'in a bulbous zone of microcrack dilatancy'. So the laser beam has generated, it seems, more heat than light, par for the course with this inscription. One wonders what the unfortunate stone is to be bombarded with next. It is well to remember Peter Rhodes' wise words which I quoted in these Reports eight years ago: 'enough letters to guarantee an archon's name can be seen only by those who know what they want to see' (Athenian Emnpire [Greece and Rome New Surveys], London 1985, 23). On Christian inscriptions, a very welcome and useful contribution came from the pen, shortly before he died, of a long-standing contributor to the Sicilian Christian corpus: A. Ferrua, Note e giunte alle iscrizioni cristiane antiche della Sicilia (Vatican City, 1989), pp. 155 (cf. also M. Greisheimer, Rivista di Archeologia Cristiana 67 [1991] 347). On numismatics the reader is referred to the review of some recent literature by A. Tusa Cutroni in Kokalos 39-40 (1993-94), 401-86, and I limit myself here to a few items cited there and elsewhere which have particularly caught my eye. The oft-repeated surmise that Sicily might have got its silver for coining from the West rather than from Greece has received some confirmation in a coin hoard from Selinus, which contained four fragmentary silver ingots; analysis of these points to a Spanish origin (C. Arnold-Biucchi et al., American Numismatic Mulselum notes 33 [19881 1-35, at 26-8; cf. id., in H. Nilsson, ed., Florilegium Nunmismaticum. Studia in honoreni U. Westermasrk edita [Stockholm 19921 13 for a study of Selinus' earliest issues). From the same pen is a monograph on a hoard which has considerable implications for the dating of the late A series (C. Arnold Biucchi, The Randazzo hoard 1980, iand Sicilian chronology in the early fifth century BC [New York 1990], pp. 77), while hoards at Syracuse have been presented by R. Ross Holloway, Ripostigli del Museo archeologico di Siraccusa (Rome 1989), pp. 90. There is also much of importance in two major conference proceedings, of the 8th and 9th Convegno del Centro internazi- onale di studi numismatici, held in 1986 and 1993 respectively: La mionetazcione corinzia in Occidente (Rome 1993), pp. xx + 330; and Lca monetcazione dell'eti dionigiana (Rome 1993), pp. xvi + 385 (the latter were pre-printed for distribution at the Convegno). L. Karlsson has reviewed the evidence for the bronze coinage of Timoleon (in Fischer-Hansen, Sicily, 149), and concluded that the (short-haired) Zeus Eleutherios issues were introduced soon after 344, and cannot be pre-Timoleontic as some have argued (e.g. E. Cammarata, EnnarotarY 2 [19881 31). The free horse, with reins loose symbolising the ridding of the Carthaginian tyranny, must post-date the Krimisos war (i.e. after 339). The revision of the Syracusan monetary system to one based on the Corinthian stater belongs not to the chaotic period of fighting but to Timoleon's last years just before his retirement in 337/6. Hieronian coinage at Syracuse and its international links have been minutely examined in M. Caccamo Caltabiano (ed.), La Sicilia tra I'Egitto e Roma7: Ia monetazione dell'etai di lerone II [Atti del Seminario, Messina, Dicembre 1993] (Messina 1995), pp. 516. B.E. Levy has looked again at the Sikeliotan coinage with what looks like an Iota Sigma monogram, interpreted by Sj0quist as reading MT and so M[organ]T[inal, and suggested rather that it stands for IHlI[ppokrate]S, grandson of a Syracusan exile and Hannibal's envoy in 212, with whom the Sicilian cities except Syracuse</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 65 sided (App. Sic. 4) (AJA 99 [1995] 354). An article about an exceptional item is C. Boehringer's study of a south German Celtic gold coin from Sicily in Die Minze. Festschrift fiir M-R. Alfoldi (Frankfurt 1991) 51-64. More general themes are reviewed by R.R. Holloway, on coinage production from the A and C Sicilian mints (in G. Depeyrot and T. Hackens, eds., R!thmes de la production monetaire de l'antiquite ct nos jours, Actes du colloque organise a Paris 1986 [Louvain-la-Neuve 1987] 11) and by K. Rutter, on Athens' relations with the Western Greeks as deduced from coin evidence (in G.K. Jenkins et al. (eds.), Kraac-Morkholm essays [Louvain-la- Neuve 1988] 245). The systematic cataloguing of the Punic coins in Syracuse can be followed in E. Acquaro (ed.), Monete puniche nelle collezioni italiane I [Bollettino di Numismatica, Monografie 6.1], Rome: museo nazionale romano; and Syra- cuse: museo archeologico regionale (Rome 1989 [publ. 1991]), 61-126. The Sicilian city coinages of the Sextus Pompey interlude and the Augustan period, for which the basic study has remained the bold but untrustworthy account of M. Grant, From Imperium to Auctoritas (1946), have now received magisterial fresh consideration by Andrew Burnett in id., M. Amandry and P.P. Ripolles, Roman provincial coinage I (London: British Museum Press and Paris: Bibliotheque Nationale, 1992), 165-81 (a work which, despite costing £150, sold out without six months of publication), and simultaneously has been the subject of a monograph study by R. Martini, Monetaz ione provinciale romanac I: Sicilia. Le emissioni tardo-repubblicane di Atratinus e le serie con ritratto di Octavianus Augustus e di Tiberius (36 a.C.-37d.C.) [Glaux 5] (Milan 1991), pp. 192. We may also note the same author's study of almost contemporary issues in Sextus Pompeius: le emissioni hispaniche del tipo CN-LAG, le serie di Eppius e gli assi siciliani [Glaux Serie speciale 1] (Milan 1995), pp. 307. There is now an appendix of addenda and corrigenda to the invaluable but sometimes untrustworthy Corpus Nummorum Siculorum (reviewed by G. Manganaro in Gnomon 60 [1988] 455): see R. Calciati, Una collezione di monete di bronzo della Sicilia antica (Primo aggiornamento critico al CNS) [Koinon 2] (Milan: Circolo Numismatico Ticinese, 1995), pp. 192. For Byzantinists there is a study of coin circulation in eastern Sicily by D. Castrizio (SicArch xxiv.76-77 [1991] 67). Of pottery studies during the past few years pride of place must be given to the wonderfully detailed study of Laconian pottery in Sicily, first published in BdA6 54 (1989) 1-62, and revised and updated in ead. and C.M. Stibbe (eds.), Lakonika: ricerche e nuovi materiali di ceramica laconica (Rome 1992), II, 123-244. Astonishingly, there is now more Laconian pottery known from Sicily than in Laconia or anywhere else; it reached Sicily from the latter half of the 7th Ct BC to the early 5th. Two-thirds of the Sicilian total are kraters, of which over 250 are known apart from 140 unpublished fragments at Megara Hyblaea; this compares with 30 from the whole of south Italy (cf. also C.M. Stibbe, Xenia 19 [1990] 5, and F. Giudice in M. Gnade, ed., Stips votiva:. papers presented to C.M. Stibbe [Amsterdam 1991] 61, for comments on the supply mechanisms which brought Laconian pottery to Sicily). For the Attic pottery trade with Sicily we await the imminent publica- tion of F. Giudice (ed.), Vasi attici ed altre ceramiche coeve in Sicilia [Atti del Convegno Catania-Camarina, 28-31 marzo 1990] (Catania, forthcoming), while for the HL period there is Erika Simon's study of a splendid new polychrome pyxis from the Centuripan workshops with a scene from Menander, perhaps from 'The Possessed Girl' (E. Simon, Menander in Centuripe [Sitzungsberichte der Wissenschaftlichen Gesell- schaft an der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt- am-Main XXV.2] (Stuttgart 1989), pp. 44; and for a general review of Centuripan vases showing scenes from the New Comedy, cf. ead., Dionisio 59.2 [1989] 45). Amphora studies, so crucial for our understanding of economic history and trading contacts, continue to make strides forward: I here single out two studies among many, N. Di Sandro's review of Massiliot amphoras in Magna Graecia and Sicily, in M. Bats (ed.), Les amphores de Marseille grecque [Etudes massalietes 2] (Aix-en-Provence and Lattes 1990), 235-9, and the excellent study of amphoras from a later period by C. Vandermersch, Vins et amphores de Grand Grece et de Sicile IV - III s. avant J-C [Centre Jean Berard. Etudes 1] (Naples 1994), pp. 280, which has rapidly established itself as the definitive work in its field. Finally we may note the publication of a number of private collections in Palermo of material largely or wholly derived from Sicily: F. Sisinni (ed.), La collezione Casuccini: storia della collezione; ceramica ellenistica (Rome 1993), pp. 105, the first of a projected series of volumes; H.P. Isler and M. Sguaitamatti (eds.), La collezione Collisani. Die Sammlung Collisani (Kilchberg and Zirich 1990), pp. 219, which has separate sections on the prehistoric pottery (by S. Tusa), on Greek and Roman objects (by the Zirich team), and on glass (by A. Giamellaro Span6); and finally the lavish and vast publication by F. Giudice and S. and V. Tusa, La collezione archeologica del Banco di Sicilia (Palermo 1992), 2 vols., pp. 381 + 239; this includes a fully-illustrated catalogue of the material (which comprises prehistoric pottery, terracottas, and Gr figured pottery, especially Attic) with excellent illustrations, many in full colour. The theme of the indigenous peoples of Sicily and their interaction with Greek and Phoenicio-Punic cultures, while not receiving undue prominence over the past few years, runs nevertheless as a constant thread through much of Sicilian archaeology (for a survey of the whole subject from the perspective of modern attitudes to the topic, see N. Cusumano, Una terra splendida e facile da possedere [Supplemento a Kokalos 10], Rome: Giorgio Bretschneider, 1994, ch. 1). An important starting point is the up-to-date survey by V. La Rosa in G. Pugliese Carratelli (ed.), Italia omnium terrarum parens. La civiltct degli Enotri, Choni, Ausoni, Sanniti, Lucani, Brettii, Sicani, Siculi, Elimi (Milan 1989), 1-110, while the art of the last three was included in an exhibition in 1993, the catalogue of which was entitled in its English language edition The art of the Italic peoples from 3000 to 300 BC (Naples 1993); pp. 271-90 (cat. nos. 167-86) concern Sicily. On the thorny question of a distinctive identity for the Elymians from the archaeological evidence, Dr Sebastiano Tusa has examined some pottery from four sites in the Trapanese and comes to the conclusion, based on the designs used in their impressed decorated pottery, that the Elymians at the height of their power (9th-8th Ct BC) enjoyed close relations with the Maltese islands (SicArch xxv.78-79 [1992] 71). Among other studies, D. Palermo has reported (CronASA 22 [1983, publ. 1991] 93) on a group of duck-shaped askoi, from S. Maria di Licodia, S. Angelo Muxaro and elsewhere, of indigenous workmanship and probably dating to c. 650/600 BC, which appear to be influ- enced by PG examples of the same type and so provide an example of Gr influence on the native peoples of the interior at one remove, like the native copy of Euboean pendent semicircles on an indigenous vase at S. Angelo Muxaro (V. Fatta, SicArch xiii.42 [1980] 43). Relations between the Phoe- nician foundations in Sicily and the native peoples with whom they came into contact is reviewed again by V. Tusa in E. Acquaro et al. (eds.), Momenti precoloniali nel Mediterraneo</page><page sequence="8">66 R. J. A. WILSON antico (Rome 1988), 273-89; while T. Sironen has reviewed the status of 'minority languages' in Sicily, especially Oscan: Oscan inscriptions come only from Messina and belong exclusively to public monuments; that Sabellians preferred to use Greek elsewhere is suggested above all by the Entella tablets, where over a dozen individuals (including patronymics) bear typically Oscan names; and the Mamertini alone adopted Oscan in their coin legends (Fischer-Hansen, Sicily, 185). For the Roman imperial period there is now for the first time full monograph treatment from the pen of R.J.A. Wilson, Sicily under the Roman Empire: the archaeology of a Roman province 36BC-AD 535 (Warminster 1990 [although in fact not published until 1991]), pp. 453 (hereafter Wilson, Sicily). G. Salmeri's Sicilia Romana: storia e storiografia (Catania: Maimone, 1992, pp. 148) has a misleading title, since the work is not a systematic treatment of its titular subject at all but a farrago of half-a-dozen essays on disconnected themes (the road system, the sulphur industry, Archimedes, the historiography of Ettore Pais, and two essays not remotely concerned with Roman Sicily). For the late Roman period there is much of interest, mainly from the historical standpoint, in S. Pricoco et al., Sicilia e Italia suburbicaria tra IV e VIII secolo [Atti del Convegno di Studi, Catania 1989] (Catania/Soveria Mannelli 1991), pp. 432. Also on late Roman and Byzantine Sicily are three of the four papers by R.M. Bonacasa Carra collected as Quattro note di archeologia cristiana in Sicilia (Palermo: Istituto di Archeologia, Universita di Palermo, 1992), pp. 110 (hereafter Quattro note). The island continues to feature, of course, in various standard reference works on Roman history and archaeology (e.g. R.J.A. Wilson in A.K. Bowman et al., eds., Cambridge Ancient History' [Cambridge 1996] 434, for the period 43 BC-AD 69; id., in A. Momigliano and A. Schiavone, eds., Storia di Roma 111.2 [Turin 1993] 279, for the late Roman period; for personifications of Sikelia, mostly R, see R.J.A. Wilson in LIMC VII [Zirich and Munich 1994] 759). There is a useful survey of Roman town houses (supplementing the account in Wilson, Sicily, 114-27) by C. Hollegaard Olsen et al. (Fischer-Hansen, Sicily, 209), and an overall account of what field-surveys have contributed to our knowledge of Roman rural settlement (O. Belvedere, ibid. 195); the latter, however, does not incorporate the results of the Monreale survey (on which see below, under Trapani prov- ince). A conference was held in 1992 at Caltagirone on 'Insediamenti rurali nella Sicilia antica', and the proceedings are said to be imminent (S. Lagona, ed., Catania: Centro di Topografia Siciliana). Another conference, on the road-system, has been published in a scarce and, one suspects, ephemeral publication as Viabilita antica in Sicilia [Atti del 3" Convegno di Studi, Riposto 30-31 Maggio 1987] (Archeoclub d'Italia, sede di Giarre-Riposto/Universita di Catania), Catania n.d, pp. 120. V. Tusa, in Sarcophagi romani in Sicilia, 2nd ed. (Rome 1995, pp. 119), has attempted to bring up to date his early foray into this topic, originally published in 1954, to which the discoveries of the past forty years are now added (and cf. now, for the Messina sarcophagi, M. Amalia Mastelloni, QuadMus- Mess 2 [1992] 57; and for a general assessment of the range of imported sarcophagi, F. Valbruzzi, QuadMess 6 [1991], publ. 1994, 107; cf. Wilson, Sicily, 242); but Tusa's work has not been totally revised and rewritten in the light of the revolution- ary strides forward in our knowledge of sarcophagi in the interim, and it remains essentially a book shaped in the 1950s. Professor P. Pensabene has looked at the re-use of ancient marble columns in the churches of Norman Sicily (Kalos vi.6 [1994] 28); and for looting of a different kind, we may also note the remarkable little salvage operation provided by the Prahistorische Staatssammlung in Munich in presenting a collection of 7th Ct AD grave groups, mostly from the Corleone district of western Sicily (H. Dannheimer, Byzantini- sche Grabfunde aus Sizilien: christliches Brauchtum imfriihen Mittelalter [Munich 1989], pp. 49 with 33 pl.): these were excavated by clandestini, who astonishingly for once seem to have kept a giornale di scavo recording their discoveries. For all the gain in securing this material for posterity, one wonders whether such action by a distinguished museum (cf. also that of the Badisches Landesmuseum and the Getty mentioned above) is lending respectability to a disreputable trade, and thereby indirectly fuelling further illegal activity. Finally, on the Byzantine and early medieval periods, what have hitherto been yawning gaps in the essential literature are now being handsomely filled. Among such publications must be counted the beautifully illustrated G. Bellafiore, Architettura in Sicilia nelle eta islamica e normanna (Palermo: Lombardi Editore 1990), and the fundamental work of F. Maurici, Castelli medievali in Sicilia: dai bizantini ai normanni (Paler- mo: Sellerio 1992, pp. 432; cf. also, more succinctly, BCASicil- ia ix-x.1-2 [1988-89] 11-41 with fine colour pictures). But particularly good news for Sicilian medieval archaeology was the splendid initiative taken by the Agrigento Soprintendenza in 1990, when two Convegni and an exhibition (in Gela) helped focus attention on what has hitherto been the Cinderella of Sicilian archaeology. The exhibition will be mentioned in its proper place below, but the Convegni produced two substantial volumes of permanent value for Sicilian medieval archaeology: G. Castellana, ed., Dagli scavi di Montevago e di Rocca d'Entella: un contributo di conoscenze per la Storia dei Musulmani della Valle del Belice dal X al XIII secolo (Monte- vago/Agrigento 1992, pp. 284: hereafter Montevago e Entella); and S. Scuto, ed., L'eta di Federico II nella Sicilia centro- neridionale (Gela/Agrigento 1991, pp. 358: hereafter Federico II). More recently, however, an even more powerful spotlight has been turned on the era of Frederick II, and with a pan-Sici- lian perspective, in an exhibition at Palermo in 1994/5, which was accompanied by a massive two-volume catalogue edited by C.A. Di Stefano, A. Cadel and M. Andaloro, Federico e la Sicilia: dalla terra alla corona (Palermo: Ediprint, 1995), pp. 706 + 561. Sicilian medieval archaeology has finally come of age. To the standard guide books already published on Sicilian archaeology there has now been added G. Buzzi and A. Giuliano, Magna Grecia e Sicilia (Milan 1995), pp. 240, in the 'Guide archeologiche Mondadori' series, and M. Caporlingua, Sicilia archeologica (Novara 1995), pp. 160, one of the 'Guide archeologiche De Agostini'. A new handbook in English, to replace the long out-of-date but still useful one by Margaret Guido, is in preparation by Dr J. Johns for Oxford University Press. Finally, to end this introduction on a sad note, readers of AR will be aware that Sicilian archaeology, and the study of the Western Greeks as a whole, have suffered a grievous double loss in the deaths of Georges Vallet and Dale Trendall. Vallet was the instigator and driving force behind the French excava- tions at Megara Hyblaea since 1948, which have so revolutionised our knowledge of archaic town-planning in the West, as well as providing us with a meticulously detailed picture of a Sicilian hellenistic city. His popularity in Sicily is epitomised by the fact that a full-length book (in fact a type of extended interview) about his life and career was thought a worthy publishing venture by a Sicilian publisher: J. Nobe- court, Un archeologo nel suo tempo: Georges Vallet (Syracuse: Ediprint, 1991, pp. 246) is a volume which not only contains fascinating bibliographical details about the man, but also</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 67 conveys admirably the passion, the sensitivity and the under- standing which Vallet showed for the country that became his adopted home. He will be sorely missed. So too will the humanity and vast erudition of Dale Trendall, globetrotter extraordinaire, who single-handedly did for Western Greek vase-painting what Beazley did for Attic; for an introduction to the subject (not to mention his magna opera), his Red-figure vases of south Italy and Sicily (London: Thames and Hudson, 1989, pp. 288) will long remain a valuable handbook. He was also, of course, a long-time contributor of the Sicily (and south Italy) report to AR. SOUTH-EAST SICILY Provinces of Syracuse and Ragusa At Syracuse work has continued on elucidating more details of the topography of the city, its necropolises, and its chora. In the heart of Ortygia, excavations by the Superintendent, Dr G. Voza, in the Montevergine convent just north of the Ionic temple, has found fragments of huts belonging to the LBA period continuously occupied into the 9th Ct BC at least (Cassibile culture), later incorporated in the walling of a colony-foundation-period structure (orthostat wall with mud- brick superstructure) on an 8th Ct BC street. This confirms earlier work (AR 1981-82 87) that the street layout appears to go back to the first-generation colonists. Another fragment of the same street on the same alignment has been found in recent work in Piazza Duomo. Other streets have been found 50m further N than Montevergine, which are clearly not on the same alignment as the modern street layout on Ortygia; so the optimistic reconstruction of the ancient grid by Agnello (Insediamenti coloniali greci in Sicilia nel VIII e VII secoli [Catania 1982] 152) and widely reproduced since (e.g. Western Greeks 271) stands in need of revision (pace AR 1981-82 87). Also in the Montevergine excavations were found what were interpreted as votive pits, with material as early as c. 700 BC; a small terracotta altar with Doric frieze was also found here, but was later in date (c. 400 BC). Also explored was a tract of Piazza Duomo immediately S of the Cathedral, where the modern asphalt was, astonishingly, found to lie directly on levels of the 5th Ct BC, since building work for the Archbish- op's Palace in 1618 had removed all later occupation. Below these C levels was a 6th Ct BC terracing wall and associated pebble road, both of which went out of use in the major reorganization of c. 480 when the exisiting Temple of Athena was built. Piers on either side of this road in front of the Archbishop's Palace clearly mark the entrance to the sacred temenos long known to lie under Piazza Duomo. It is also now clearly established for the first time that the main N-S decuma- niis on Ortygia continued southwards on the same alignment from the Apollonion, past the Ionic temple and the 5th Ct temple of Athena, and beyond. The three temples are aligned with the E-W stenopoi which intersect with this major N-S axis. The bottom-most layers at the Piazza Duomo site contained material from, respectively, the Cassibile, Thapsos and Castelluccian cultures. In Neapolis, of course, it is the mighty Hieronian theatre which is the most impressive of the surviving monuments, a structure published in exhaustive if sometimes controversial detail by L. Polacci and C. Anti in 1981. To this we now have a sequel by the first-named (L. Polacco with other contributors, II teatro antico di Siracusa. Pars altera [Padua 1990], pp. 197 + 269 photographs), which attempts to place the theatre in its wider setting by recording the monuments of the upper terrace (including the nymphaeum), the LR necropolis, and the small-scale sanctuaries in the immediate neighbourhod of the theatre. One of those, the work on the sanctuary of Demeter and Ceres (already reported in AR 1987-88 112), has now also been published in loving and minute detail (L. Polacco, M. Trojani and A. Carlo Scolari, II santuario di Cere e Libera ad summamr Neapolin di Siracusa, Venice 1989, pp. 251). Pro- fessor Polacco's distilled views on the theatre and its environs, with which not all will agree (cf. AR 1987-88 112), can be more digestibly followed in his short guidebook (L. Polacco, II teatro antico di Siracusa, Edizioni dell'Ariete, Syracuse 1992, pp. 80), the first of a projected series, 'Guide di Sirac- usa', under the editorship of S.L. Agnello. Meanwhile, Dr Voza's work has continued on the Belvedere terrace above the Greek theatre, with most interesting results. The earliest occupation was that of an MBA village (huts and some tombs); then, in the 6th Ct BC, the area became sacred and a small A temple was erected. Inserted in it later, in the 5th Ct, were two symmetrically-placed tombs constructed in excellent isodomic masonry. Dr Voza suggests that these may have been the resting places of the tyrant Gelon and his wife Demarete, even though Diodorus makes it clear that Gelon's tomb lay well outside the city, probably near the Olympieion (11.38.4, but his distance of 200 stades is a mistake; cf. 14.63.3 and E.A. Freeman, History of Sicily 2 [Oxford 1891] 216). Whether so or not, the prominent burial within a shrine in this way within the city's boundaries is clearly exceptional, and an exceptional historical circumstance is to be sought for it. Later this temple formed the focal point of the great Hieronian pi-shaped stoa built to flank it on the same orienta- tion as the great theatre below (AR 1987-88 112); part of a second temple, at right-angles to and E of the first, has also now been identified. It is probably to this later temple that the architectural pieces belong which were found fallen into the Greek quarries below a dozen years ago (G. Voza, Kokalos 30-31 [1984-85] 675), pieces which were reconstructed on paper as belonging to a tetrastyle prostyle temple of 11.90m. by 8.6m (which basically fits the newly-found structure). Another huge Hieronian stoa has recently been identified near the modern stadium in Achradina. Elsewhere in Syracuse, the principal excavations of recent years, directed by Dr G. Voza and Dr B. Basile for the Soprintendenza, have concerned a huge HL necropolis to the S of the Fusco cemetery on the W side of the city in the Tor di Conte district, excavated in advance of its destruction by a new railway line. Over 3,000 tombs of the 3rd and 2nd Ct BC have been uncovered, both inhumation and cremation, mostly in trench graves ('a fossa') but some in chamber tombs; about half the graves still had their skeletons preserved. Grave goods are reported to be rich, with plentiful coins and some jewellery, as well as a wide range of ceramic material. The study and full publication of this cemetery will clearly be of immense importance for a better understanding of the reign of Hieron II and the cultural impact, if any, caused by Syracuse's incorpor- ation into the R province in 211 BC. But an even greater surprise awaited the excavation team. The necropolis lay on top of a vast Pleistocene deposit, consisting of various sandy deposits ranging from lower Pleistocene (750 thousand years ago) through middle to upper Pleistocene (300-200 thousand years ago). Thousands of bones have been recovered, including those of dwarf elephants 2m tall (elephas mnaidrensis), bears, turtles, birds, small reptiles and a rare giant edible dormouse (Leithia melitensis), all of about 500 thousand years ago; they were joined about 300 thousand years ago by hippopotamus (hippopotamus pentlandi), when the area became marshy;</page><page sequence="10">68 R. J. A. WILSON organic remains are reported from these riverine deposits, including plant remains and fibres (Archeologia Viva xiv.50 [March/April 1995] 30). An exhibition of these exciting discoveries was presented in Syracuse between March and May 1996 in the ex-chiesa of Montevergine (ibid. xv.56 [March/April 1996] 16), and a new archaeological park presenting in situ the section of the excavation spared by the railway line is being planned On the Epipolae plateau Dr Dieter Mertens and his team from the German Archaeological Institute in Rome, in collabor- ation with the Technical University of Munich, have once more turned their attention to the Euryalos fortress. The latest work has demonstrated that the fortress as we see it today, with its imposing five-tower artillery battery, is the work of Agathocles (304-289), with alterations and modifications undertaken by Hieron II, and that the original fort at this point built by Dionysius I was a simpler, smaller, sub-triangular redoubt which lay in the E half of the later enclosure. A survey of the walls themselves has also begun, and a new large double-gate has been discovered 150 m N of the known gate immediately N of the Euryalos fort (D. Mertens, Akten des XIII Internation- alen Kongesses fiur Klassische Archdologie, Berlin 1988 [Mainz 1990] 476; Antike Welt 23 [1992] 313). Among work on the long-known material, R.M. Albanese Procelli has published in admirable detail a monograph on Ripostigli di bronzi della Sicilia nel Museo archeologico di Siracusa (Palermo: Accademia nazionale di scienze, lettere e arti di Palermo, 1993, pp. 344); this includes the especially important Mendolito hoard (on which see below, under Catania province). The Apollonion inscription (cf. AR 1987-88 108) continues to tease: see most recently Acme 40 (1987) 18 and M. Guarducci in Saggi in onore di G. De Angelis d'Ossat (Rome 1987) 43. The water supply of the Gr city has been studied by S. Collin Bouffier (MEFRA 99 [1987] 661), while the powerful bearded male god from the amphitheatre has been identified as derived from a statue of Asklepios by the Pergam- ene master Phyromachos, a copy variously dated to the Augustan period (B. Andreae in id., ed., Phvromachos-Prob- leme [Mainz 1990] 45) or to the late 2nd/early 1st Ct BC (Wilson, Sicily, 339). The famous bronze ram from Syracuse, the surviving example (now in Palermo) of what was originally a pair, which has been traditionally ascribed to the early 3rd Ct BC on no secure grounds (e.g. Western Greeks 422, Cat. 353), has been re-dated to the Augustan or Julio-Claudian period on both stylistic and technical grounds (the crescent-shaped depression used to depict the eye, not otherwise attested before the late 1st Ct BC), and attributed to Syracusan bronzesmiths whose high reputation at this period is attested by their summons to work on Agrippa's Pantheon (Pliny NH 34.13) in 27/25 B.C. (Wilson, Sicily, 343). Finally we may note the publication of three monographs on various aspects of the ancient city: B.D. Wescoat (ed.), Syracuse: the fairest Greek city. Ancient art from the Museo archeologico Paolo Orsi (Rome 1990), pp. 123, a handsome catalogue of an exhibition showed at Emory (Atlanta), and a welcome addition to the scanty bibliography available in English for undergraduates; G. Vallet and L. Vallet Mascoli, Siracusa antica: immagini e immagine (Palermo: Lombardi Editori, 1993), pp. 189, prim- arily an anthology of 18th- and 19th-Ct writings on Syracuse; and a short treatment, consisting of four essays, on Siracusa bizantina, edited by S.L. Agnello (Syracuse: Associazione Russia Cristiana 'San Vladimir', 1990), pp. 93, a period in the city's life about which all too little is presently known. Meanwhile work on preparing the upper floor (presenting the HL and R collections) of the Museo archeologico regionale 'Paolo Orsi' continues apace; the French School at Rome is also assisting, and are inter alia working on an assemblage of nearly 700 lamps of the 4th-7th Ct which come from hypogea in the S. Lucia quarter (M. Griesheimer, MEFRA 105 [1993] 470). The same writer has also re-examined the catacombs of S. Giovanni, not studied in detail since Fuhrer and Schultze at the beginning of this century (Die altchristlichen Grabstiitten Siziliens [Berlin 1907]), and has suggested three main phases of its chronological development: the neat symmetry of the original scheme, of arcosolia burials arranged along a decuma- nus and five intersecting cardines, was spoiled by the addition of rotundas for the Syracusan aristocracy after the Peace of the Church, and by later additions which also ignored the initial coherence of the layout (MEFRA 101 [1989] 751). Surprising amounts of fresco decoration, albeit no one example very large, still survive in situ in these catacombs, despite the rather damp and dank conditions. Dr Griesheimer has published a note on those that depict timber trellis work, for example above an arcosolium flanking a painted Chi-Rho, and suggests that actual timber trelliswork screens closed off the arcosolium openings, as is sometimes suggested by marks in the mortar rendering (Miscellanea sanctorum venerantes: miscellanea in onore di Monsignor Victor Saxer [Vatican City 1992] 483). His full publication of these catacombs, forthcoming in the Collection Ecole Francaise de Rome series (M. Greisheimer, La catacom?be Saint-Jean et les monuments environnants: notes de topographie cimeteriale et d'epigraphie chretienne) is eagerly awaited (cf. CRAI 1990, 786). J.B. Curbera has offered refinements on the readings of two inscriptions from this catacomb, demonstrating in particular on one (Agnello, Silloge no. 30) that an age-of-deceased numeral which had presented difficulty, an elongated L, stands for 'half', as shown by its use on Egyptian papyri (ZPE 108 [1992] 100). We also have now a detailed and valuable consideration of catacomb inscriptions and other Syracusan LR epigraphic material from a demo- graphic point of view, analysing such statistics as average life expectancy, age of marriage and social position (M. Sgarlata, Ricerche di demografia storica: le iscrizioni tardo-imperiali di Siracusa [Studi di antichita cristiana XLV], Vatican City 1991, pp. 156). S.L. Agnello has drawn attention to 19th century documents which describe and partially sketch paintings in these catacombs which have now been totally destroyed (SicGymn 45 [1992] 141). Also in the ambit of palaeochristian archaeology, a new piece of evidence to add to the small body of evidence for Sicilian jewry (cf. Wilson, Sicily, 310) has come from a freshly discovered arcosolium tomb at Rossolini (contrada Scala Arancio), where a seven-branched candlestick (menorah) is carved over the opening (MEFRA 105 [1993] 471, fig. 28). At one of Syracuse's daughter foundations, Acrae, a stoa of Hieronian date, along with the contemporary monumentalisat- ion of the agora, has recently been identified on the S side of the main E-W street uncovered in the early 1970s, roughly in the position where it was expected. M. Mertens Horn has discussed in the context of similar Sicilian examples a terracotta antefix of a female head, probably a nymph, of c. 525/500 BC, found by Gabriele Judica at Acrae and sold by him in 1885 to the Dresden Museum; it is now lost, presumed destroyed in the war, but two DAI photographs of c. 1900 survive (BdA6 lxxvi.66 [1991] 9). Also at Acrae, Giulia Sfameni Gasparro has helped to put in context the well-known series of rock-cut reliefs in honour of Cybele, and concluded by analogy with comparable examples that the notion of the open-air rock-cut sanctuary is likely to be the result of influ- ence from Asia Minor, to help give an 'authentic' air to the</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 69 cult of a goddess who originated from there, and also reflects the Mediterranean contacts enjoyed by the Syracuse of Hieron II, to whose reign the reliefs are here ascribed (in E.N. Lane, ed., Cvbele, Attis Iand relaIted cults: essavs inl 7memor of MJ. Verma71tseIren ILeiden 19961 51). At Lentini we may note the full publication by M. Frasca and D. Palermo of various necropolises excavated in 1977-82 (Cugno Carrube. Piscitello and Pozzaghera) in a volume of CronASA 21 (1983) Ipubl. 1991!]. The first is an EBA-EIA cemetery (Castelluccio-Pantalica Sud-Thapsos cultures); the second presents 108 tombs of c. 465-390 BC (of which 36 are inhumations, 3 ench\trisnmos and 45 cremations, the rest uncertain), with generally modest grave goods (there is only a little poor-quality rf): and the third reports on 55 tombs covering a wide arc of time between the 1 lth/9th Ct and the 4th Ct BC. Other work has been reported in M. Frasca and F. Sgalambro (eds.). Un trenlteinniio di indaltgii nel territorio di Lentini antica. Atti del'Incontro di studi su Alfio Sgalambro (Catania 1987), which includes iiter alita a summary of Dr U. Spigo's work at Lentini (1977-85), before he left the Syracuse Soprintendenza for Messina. For a largely historical exegesis on Lentini, we also now have C. Gula, Storiat di Leontinoi: dalle origini alia conlquista 'roli1i1an! (Catania 1995), pp. 246. At Megara Hyblaea, after several years devoted mainly to study of the unpublished material, a fresh campaign of excava- tion was launched in 1989 and again in 1992 on the E side of the town close to the sea. in the shallow valley which separates the two plateaux on which the ancient city is built (G. Vallet. MEFRA 1(2 [1990] 492; ibid. 105 [1993] 462). The principal discovery is that of a large-block wall 62m long, probably a precinct wall rather than belonging to a building. The base of the stele in honour of Phintoulos son of Eugritos (Kokalos 25 [19791 256) has been found adjacent to this wall and at an oblique angle to it. The date of the wall is uncertain, but structures leaning up against its inside face appear to belong to the 3rd Ct BC. There is evidence that the large wall was destroyed soon afterwards, and the area was then used as a burial ground: an isolated cremation burial of the 6th Ct was also found. Another excavation on the SW side of the ancient city. in advance of the construction of archaeological stores. has discovered a small inhumation necropolis in an area where previously none was suspected. The area had been badly destroyed by agriculture and grave-robbing, but remaining finds, including coins, indicate that some tombs are likely to belong to the 6th Ct BC (including a stone sarcophagus). others to the 3rd Ct BC: while one produced a coin of Constantine II (AD 337-340)-perhaps left by Roman clandestini rather than a true LR burial (G. Vallet. MEFRA 104 [1992] 505). Among other work, Vallet's last thoughts on the town-plan can be found in Saggi in onore di G. De Angelis d'Ossat (Rome 1987) 81; B. Berquist has re-interpreted the heroon (MegaraL Hvblaea I, 2 1) as a hestiatorioni (in A. Schachter, ed., Le sanctuaire grec [Entretiens Hardt XXXVII], Geneva 1992, 141); and for a consideration of Megara Hyblaea's relations with the Sikels during the settling-in period and after, see A.J. Graham, in O. Lordkipanidze (ed.), Local ethno-politicl entiti es of the Black Sea areai in the 7th-4th centuries BC (Tbilisi 1988) 304-21 (I owe this reference to Dr F. De Angelis). At Villasmundo, with its well-known burial assemblages of very early ('pre-colonial') Gr imported pottery, mixed with native wares (AR 1976-77 66), which still await full publication (some totally unpublished pieces are on display in Syracuse museum), we may note that a question mark now arises over the early date of the Euboean pendent semicircle skyphos, which may belong to the second half of the 8th Ct rather than its first half (R. Kearsley, The pendent semi-circle skyphos, BICS Supplementary volume, [London 1989]); the jury is, however, still out on the validity of the proposed new chrono- logy (cf. M. Popham and I. Lemos, Gnomon 64 [1992] 152). At Pantalica the most significant development is the publication of L. Bernab6 Brea's Pantalica. Ricerche intorno all'andktoron [Cahiers du Centre Jean Berard XIV] (Naples and Palazzolo Acreide 1990), pp. 115, a full report on his excavations between 1962 and 1971, adding many details to Orsi's study of the building (Monumenti antichi 9 [1899] 75). It is now shown to measure 37.5m x 14.2m and to comprise at least seven rooms. The fortification wall and a trapezoidal tower (6.12m x 6.55m) were uncovered nearby. F. Tomasello has attempted to discover the unit of measurement used in the construction of the anaktoron, and has come up with a unit of measure of 30.467cm.; he further suggests that other rectangu- lar buildings constructed under Mycenaean influence (e.g. at Thapsos) can similarly be analysed for the simple units of measurement that they employ (SicGymn 45 [1992] 113). There is also a pleasing photographic essay on Pantalica by G. Orlando, with text by S. Tusa, Pantalica e la valle dell'Anapo (Palermo 1988), pp. 91. The archaeology of the limestone uplands immediately N of Avola Vecchia in the territory of Cassibile has also been examined, and some new sites recorded (M. Turco, SicArch xxiii.72 [1990] 67). On matters coastal and submarine. we may note a valuable and detailed survey, rare in a Sicilian context, of the coastal geology of SE Sicily from Syracuse to Camarina, which attempts to identify possible coastline changes from prehistoric times to late antiquity (G. Lena et al., Archivio storico silracusano3 2 [1988] 5). Dr B. Basile of the Syracuse Soprint- endenza has summarised recent underwater finds in Syracuse province, including those reported in AR 1987-88 115. Nov- elties include a Lamboglia 2 (Peacock and Williams 8A) amphora wreck (2nd/mid- I st Ct BC) at Punta Pizzo near Portopalo: another with the same amphoras at Isola dei Porri W of Capo Passero: further work in 1988 on the Vulpiglia wreck first investigated by Dr A.J. Parker in 1976 (AR 1987-88 115), which has now produced two Corinthian A amphoras which are too early for the wreck and presumably do not belong: and most significantly of all. work at Punta Castellu- zzo N of Augusta. where fragments of imported amphoras types LR I (Cilician), 2 (Aegean/Black Sea) and 10 have been identified, as well as Keay type LII, now thought to be Sicilian (see below, on Naxos). Two further detailed interim reports have been published on the Plemmirio B wreck, including the medical instruments and the lamps (D.J.L. Gibbins, IJNA 18 [1989] 1) and the coarse pottery. the glass and the lead fishing-weights (id., IJNA 20 [19911 227). These finds all fall within the date-range of AD 180/22(). and confirm initial suggestions fiom the amphoras that the ship went down c. 200. The pottery is mostly Tunisian as one would expect on an African oil and gtlrum ship, and was being carried by the crew, not as cargo: one flat-rimmed saucepan is, however, certainly from central Italy. whether acquired by its owner there or as an import in Africa is unknown. R-period fish-fattening tanks at Portopalo, Torre Vendicari (near Note) and Capo Ognina (S of Syracuse) have also been the subject of study (G. Purpura, Si(Arch xxii.69-70 [1989] 25; B. Basile, V Rassegna sl(ybacquea, 55). At Camarina recent work directed by the indefatigable Dr Giovanni Di Stefano has concentrated in the agora, which was divided into two by a central stoa in the 4th Ct BC. There are no A buildings underneath the agora, which was clearly reserved as the city's principal open square from the foundation</page><page sequence="12">70 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 3 Fig. 4 of the city. A small shrine was discovered on the E side of the upper agora in 1991, adjacent to the row of altars already known there (AR /987-88 116). The west side of the upper agora is bounded by a substantial stone retaining wall, and adjacent to it a small fountain basin with hydraulic mortar lining has been uncovered, of 4th/3rd Ct BC date. Although on a less monumental scale, this provides a welcome addition to our knowledge of public fountains in Greek Sicily, enhanced in recent years by the discoveries of examples at Syracuse (AR /976-77 66) and Morgantina (AR /987-88 136). The lower agora is bounded on its W side not by another stoa but by a 5th Ct building of uncertain purpose. The S side of the lower agora is closed by a 'south building' now under excavation; it may prove to be another stoa. If funds permit, Dr Di Stefano hopes to extend the excavation zone further S fi-om the agora in the hope of discovering Camarina's theatre: intriguingly, there is a convenient gentle slope here with a splendid view of the sea. From the Temple of Athena the remarkable cache of lead tablets (AR 1987-88 116), found in 1987, has been published with commendable promptness by F. Cordano, Le tessere pubbliche cdcl temp(io di Atena a Ci7amalriin (Rome 1992), together with general discussion of the constitutions of Sicilian cities, on the democratic organisation of Camarina after 461 for which the tesserae provide clear evidence, and on the many linguistic nuances that they raise (cf. ecad.. PdP 279 [19941 418 for further reflections, and R. Arena, Acme 47 119941 1 1 for some refinements). One side usually gives name and patronym, the other has the phratry number, of which 14 are attested, but there may have been 18 in all. The tesserae served in the process of electing judges or magistrates, and could be used a second time. Interesting references include mention of the triakkas, presumably comparable to the tricakalarrchoi of IG XIV, 211-12 (Acrae); and reference to the dekalitron shows this Sicilian monetary unit, the equivalent of the Corinthian stater, was in use in 5th-Ct Camarina. Many new names have been supplied by the tesserae for the corpus of Sicilian ono- mastics, of which one, Sychaios, is likely to be of Phoenician origin, and two more, Thripainos and Mazan, are certainly non-Greek (P.M. Fraser and E. Matthews [eds.], A Lexicon of Greek personacl names, volume 3, forthcoming, probably 1998). Also at Camarina, a further 120 tombs have been excavated in the Rifriscolaro necropolis (Fig. 3); among earlier dis- coveries from this necropolis we have now also M.T. Manni Piraino's listing of the amphoras graffiti (Kokalos 33 [1987] 89). Also to be warmly welcomed is the admirably full publication by M.T. Lanza of Orsi's campaigns in the Passo Marinaro necropolis between 1904 and 1909, when over 1000 tombs were excavated (P. Orsi, La necropoli cli Piasso Macrin- aro, Clamacrina [Monumenti Antichi Serie Miscellanea IV], Rome 1991, pp. 229 with 114 plates). They date from the period immediately after the refoundation in 461 BC (Thuc. 6.5.3): 50% belong to between then and the end of the 5th Ct, and the rest are 4th Ct with a few belonging to the 3rd Ct BC. Not surprisingly, there are many similarities with Gela (such as the frequency of tile burials and the use of terracotta sarcopha- gi). 80% are inhumations, of which 15% are enchvtrismos amphora burials for new-born or small children. 30% of all inhumations were in fact of children, a reminder of the high mortality rate of this age group in antiquity. There was no correlation between the type of grave goods and the sex of the deceased. 52% of pottery was imported, of which 80% is reckoned to be Attic and 20% Corinthian. Four lead defixiones were among the finds, which are now separated between the museums of Syracuse and Ragusa. For Camarina's museum there is now an excellent guidebook in the attractive Musei di Sicilia series by A. Di Vita, G. Di Stefano and G. D'Andrea, Clamarina: museo archeologico (Palermo: Novecento, and Rome: Libreria dello Stato, 1995), pp. 69. Meanwhile, in the waters off Camarina, a succession of extraordinary archaeological discoveries has once again demonstrated with dramatic results the wealth of the Sicilian underwater heritage. The initial spark was provided by the chance discovery in 1987 of a 6th Ct BC helmet, 34cm high, claimed as Peloponnesian work, which was discovered off Punta Braccetto, 7km S of Camarina. Further investigation has revealed an amphora wreck of the second half of the 6th Ct BC (or perhaps rather of the 5th Ct: Parker, Shipwrecks no. 915); 22 of the amphoras were raised, mostly Corinthian A</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 71 Fig. 6 Fig. 5 types, but also present were two Punic amphoras and one each from Etruria (Py 3b), Marseilles (Bertucchi I), Lesbos and Clazomenae according to Dr Di Stefano's classification. Also on board were a 6 x 5cm rectangular sheet of silver, thirty A2 Ionic cups, two lamps and plenty of plain wares (Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 111; III Rassegna subacquea, 25; G. Di Stefano, Antichi relitti nella baia di Cclmnarina: catalogo della Mostra [Ragusa 1991] 9). But the underwater discoveries off Camarina did not stop there. In 1989-90, the so-called 'wreck of the columns', Camarina A, first explored by Dr A.J. Parker of Bristol University in the 1970s (Parker, Shipwrecks no. 163), was further investigated: this had a cargo of yellow marble columns from the imperial quarries at Chemtou in Tunisia, of which two still lie on the seabed; whether more have been looted in the past is unknown. The date, judging from the Africano I amphoras on board, is c. AD 175/200. The new investigations have produced an astonishing array of prestige items, all in copper alloy (G. Di Stefano, Antichi relitti, 39; IV Rassegna subacquea 127, V Rassegna 196): strigils, a jug, two buckets with handles still attached, a samovar 25cm high (Fig. 4) decorated with theatrical masks just below the rim and a lion's head protome spout, and a rare and delightful (perfume?)- container with blue enamel inlay, 24cm high (Fig. 5), decor- ated with vine leaves and trellis patterns. Also found were a lead box (34 x 23 x 43.5cm) with central circular hole and tendril designs on either side of the opening, and 34 lead sling shot. In the same years (1989-90) there was next discovered, in shallow water off the beach at Camarina, the wreck-site Camarina B (Parker, Shipwrecks, no. 164), which was carrying a cargo of lamps, of late-lst-Ct AD African type, stamped with the name of the maker STACTE; 63 of them were found together in one concreted lump (Fig. 6), and very early forms of ARS are also reported with it (Hayes forms lb and 2b), as well as a small silver bowl and a marble mortarium with four projecting lug handles symmetrically arranged (G. Di Stefano, Antichi relitti, 29; V Rassegna subaccquea 192). Further S lay Camarina C (Parker, Shipwrecks, no. 165), which is a medieval galley, the bottom of its 4m-wide hull well-preserved. Pots made of iron plates were found, along with a concreted mass of iron metal which included inter alia horseshoes, nails, and a hammer and tongs; also discovered, unusually in a wreck, were horse bones in quantity, so the ship may have been a horse transporter, perhaps of the 12th Ct AD (G. Di Stefano, Antichi relitti, 55; id., IV Rassegna slubacquea 130; id., SicArch xxvii.85-86 [1994] 87). Camarina D (Parker, Shipwrecks, no. 166) may not be a wreck-site at all, in that no ship and no cargo were found. What was discovered was a hoard of over a thousand coins of the period AD 253-273 and remains of the wooden chest which contained them; a marble female head may have been associated with them. The coins are of six 3rd-Ct emperors from the mints of Rome, Milan and Cyzicus, together with coins of the Gallic empire and other provincial radiates which constitute nearly 18% of the ident- ified coins; quite what these are doing so far from their normal distribution area is yet to be explained (G. Di Stefano, VI Rassegna subacquea 1; Archeo vii.2 [Feb. 1992] 17; ibid. viii.7 [July 1993] 84). From the same site came a perfectly-preserved copper alloy balance (Fig. 7), with steelyard arm, weighing pan and chains, and balance in the form of what the excavator called a female head, probably of a goddess (G. Di Stefano, 97 Misurare nell'antichit,i. Rinvenimenti subacquei a Camarina [Ragusa 1994] 9), but which is clearly meant to represent Attis, with Phrygian cap and hand (concealing his Pan-pipes) to the lips (cf. LIMC III [1986] Attis no. 365). But still the discoveries went on. In 1990, in the middle of Camarina Bay S of the agora, another helmet came to light,</page><page sequence="14">72 R. J. A. WILSON 0 5 10 r;- - cm Fig. 7 along with a cargo of Greco-Italic amphoras, from a wreck-site which I am calling Camarina E (its discovery came too late for Parker, Shipwrecks, whose list stops with Camarina D). The helmet, 34cm high (Fig. 8), is described as 'Attic-Etruscan' by its excavator and dated to the second half of the 4th Ct (G. Di Stefano, Antichi relitti, 15; V Rassegnal slubacqulea 180); it is rather a well-preserved example of the Monterfortino A type, probably of the 3rd Ct BC, with exaggerated cuspings on the cheek pieces as on examples in the Castel S. Angelo in Rome and in the Museo Stibbert in Florence (H.R. Robinson, The larmotlr of Imnlerial Rome [London 1975] 17, pls. 4-5; M.C. Bishop and J.C.N. Coulston, RomLan imilitiary equipmlent [London 1993] 60). Another chance find, in July 1993, fi-om the sea immediately below the agora, is that of six inscribed lead weights, probably of the 2nd Ct BC, and assumed to come from the agorantonos' office in the agora above (G. Di Stefano, Misisrarre nell 'antichit£U. Rinvenimnenti subacquei ai Camarinac [Ragusa 1994] 16; Archeologia Viva xiii.45 [May- June 1994] 46). The largest is inscribed in raised letters dekalitron on one side and eitalikon dikaio ('good for Italy') on the back (Fig. 9), and weighs 3200 gr. (nominally 10 litres should weigh 3274.5 gr); the others are a pentalitre, a dilitre, a litre (with kantharos on one side and dolphin on the reverse), two half-litres and a third-litre, all but one short-changing slightly on the standard nominal value. Fascinating though all this has been, an even more sensa- tional discovery was made in the late summer of 1994, just N of the mouth of the river Irminio in the vicinity of Camarina's harbour (G. Di Stefano, Archeologia Viva xiv.52 [July-August 1995] 26). What was found was a cache of objects in copper alloy comprising a dinner service (dishes, basins with suspen- sion rings, a jug) and klinai legs (one of leonine shape) and other pieces of couch decoration, including a swan's head and neck. A three-legged stand, a perfectly preserved statuette of Venus, and a gold seal ring engraved with a cockerel pecking a lizard are also among the finds, which appear to date to the 0 5 10 _ _ cm Fig. 8 ·I . : - .....I:1:.,. .:: ": Fig. ;- ,A :, ' ',l1 i :|0 - ' ' t : - 'it ;1. : ? ; 1 I::·' " . r i- ; 0 5 10 i : cm Fig. 9 lst/2nd Ct AD. The find-spot is described as that of a wreck, but there is no mention of remains of a ship or of transport cargo in what has been published so far. Not surprisingly amid all this heady excitement, there is ambitious talk of creating an underwater archaeological park, with visitors making a tour of this plethora of seabed sites in a submersible; but whether or </page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 not that fails through lack of money or tourist appeal, the energy and enthusiasm of Dr Di Stefano have demonstrated with striking clarity the enormous potential of similar system- atic research elsewhere in Sicilian waters. Among long-known material from Camarina, F. Giudice has studied the changing pattern of Attic imports into Sicily (QuadMess 3 [1988] 49), with Attica playing a minor role before 484 but taking the dominant share of the market after the refoundation of 461. G. Manganaro has published five new fragments of tablets concerning purchase of land and/or houses of c. 300/100 BC (PdP 44 [1989] 189). Archaic Camarina was the subject of a convegno at Palermo published in the pages of Kokalos 33 (1987): particularly useful is Dr Di Stefano's detailed synthesis of discoveries belonging to that period in Camarina's immediate territory (ibid. 129-201). Further work in that chora apparently indicates the continu- ation of the same regular grid for rural settlement that dictated the urban layout, and on the same axes: rock-cut roads have been traced which determine this layout. The individual parcels of land appear to measure 210m x 265m. Within this layout two further farms have been excavated, to add to those of Iurato and Capodicasa already known (AR 1981-82 90; Kokalos 26-27 [1980-81] 724). One is called Pellilia, but most work so far (in 1994) has been carried out at Castalia, another 4th Ct BC farm with a good water-supply, and lying on a rock-cut road which is the eastward continuation of that already found in the Rifriscolaro necropolis nearby. A case has been made for localising the ancient city of Tyrakinai, included on the itinerary of the Delphic theorodokoi in the 3rd Ct BC (Historia 13 [1964] 420), and included among the peoples of Sicily by Pliny (NH 3.91), with the enigmatic LR site of Cava d'Ispica (A. Messina, Journal of ancient topography i [1991] 166-8), but the archaeological identification of the ancient city on the ground awaits further elucidation. Also of note is Dr Di Stefano's admirably full publication of a 10th/9th Ct BC bronze hoard found on the banks of the river Irminio in contrada Castelluccio N of Scicli in 1978. Comprising over 200 bronze daggers, spear-heads, brooches and bracelets, mostly in fragments, along with scrap metal, and clearly therefore a metalworker's hoard ready for melting down, it represents a welcome addition to the known Sicilian hoards of this date on the eve of the arrival of the Greeks (G. Di Stefano, NSc 1990-91 [publ. 1994] 489). For the R period, G. Di Stefano has reconsidered the distribution of R settlement on the Ragusano plateaux in the context of the R grain supply, and noted an increase in sites during the Roman Republican period and a further increase in the later Empire; but the data are too incomplete to reach any definitive conclusions (in Ravitaillement en ble, 237; cf. also id., in S. Lagona, ed., Insediamenti rurali nella Sicilia antica, forthcoming). We may also note the resumed exploration in 1988-89 of an R bath-building in the centre of modern Comiso, first explored by Biagio Pace nearly 50 years ago when a mosaic of Neptune was found (NSc 1946, 162). Part of a series of heated rooms with circular brick pilae have been uncovered, forming part of a first-phase bath-building now dated to the second half of the 2nd Ct AD, and the Neptune mosaic can now be shown to have come from a rectangular room (frigidarium) adjacent to the heated rooms, and so is likely to be contemporary with them, rather than belonging to the 4th Ct as has sometimes been claimed (e.g. Wilson, Sicily, fig. 131). In a later period, provisionally dated in the 5th Ct AD, this bath-building was replaced by another at a higher level, of which parts of two adjacent octagonal rooms with poor-quality opus sectile floors, and a semicircular bath (a fountain according to the excavator) on one side of one of the rooms, survive. Finds of this phase include a gold solidus of Arcadius (AD 395-408), a gold earring, and an inscribed gold sheet, yet to be deciphered (G. Di Stefano, SicArch xxvii.85-86 [1994] 77). The remains have been consolidated and left exposed in the middle of the modern town. The structure hitherto thought to have been an octagonal Byz baptistery at the castello of Comiso has now been convincingly reinterpreted as an Arab Cuba of 10th or 11th Ct date (A. Messina, SicArch xxiv.76-77 [1991] 43). At S. Croce Camarina, known archaeologically for its two well-preserved paleochristian chapels (Wilson, Sicily, 308), ten rock-cut sub divo burials of a late Byz necropolis near one of the chapels (Messagnone) produced plain pottery grave-goods, apparently of 8th-9th Ct AD date. About the LR and Byz village at Punta Secca on the S coast, which most identify with the Caucana of Procopius BV 1.14, I think erroneously (Wilson, Sicily, 393, n. 184), a rather fuller account than what is currently available (the whole site is essentially still unpub- lished in detail, as are all the finds) has appeared from the pen of L. Calabrese, Kaukana e altri monumlenti tardo-antichi del ragusano (Ragusa: Libroitaliano, 1994), pp. 190. In the waters off here (contrada Palmento), a chance discovery of 1991 was that of a silver plate with a Latin cross and the name Theodos- ius engraved at the centre. This probably 6th-Ct AD piece of silver is a welcome addition to the very few pieces of high- status silverware so far known from LR and Byz Sicily (G. Di Stefano, VI Rassegna subacquea 6). The village in contrada Trepiedi near Modica, where a small catacomb has long been known (Pace, ACSA IV,164, fig. 49), and which some think from a funerary inscription found there (Agnello, Silloge, no. 93) to have been called Hortisiana (see contra Wilson, Sicily, 225), a new small hypogeum has been discovered with a funerary tablet namng the deceased as Dionys(i)a, and telling us that she died on December 30th (in which year is not revealed). A globular glass flask from this hypogeum probably belongs to the fourth century AD. Of an adjacent sub divo necropolis about a hundred tombs were uncovered in 1988-89, either rock-cut or slab-built. Most contained single inhumations, but 35% had two burials, and in some there were multple depositions of up to five skeletons in a single tomb. The grave goods, generally poor, include some closed forms of 2nd-Ct ARS (Hayes 152, 156, 160), lamps, glass vessels and, from just three tombs, jewellery in the form of brooches, rings and a gold-wire pendent. Both numismatic evidence (coins of Julia Mammaea, Gordian III, and Claudius II) and the pottery suggests that the cemetery was in use between the mid-2nd and the late 4th Ct AD (G. Di Stefano, Atti del VII Congresso nazcionale di archeologia cristiana, Cassino 1993, forthcoming). In the territory of Giarratana, beside the river Irminio, in a locality suggestively called Ortomosaico, trial trenching has located parts of eight rooms of a R building, all floored with polychrome geometric mosaics, ranged around a central peristyle; the site covers at least 200 sq m. The style of the mosaics does not appear particularly accomplished, suggesting the work of a local Sicilian atelier rather than imported African mosaicists. The date awaits clarification. This looks set to be another example to add to the still small but gradually growing number of wealthy R villas known in the island. More prob- lematical is the site of I Margi, also in the territory of Giarratana, which has produced inter alia a small marble head of a boy, now in Ragusa Museum (Wilson, Sicily, pi. 174c), and a statue of a now headless woman in local stone, currently in a private collection in Ragusa Ibla. Orsi was the first to report R material at I Margi, especially from a LR necropolis 73</page><page sequence="16">74 R. J. A. WILSON (NSc 1919, 86). Evidence has been found more recently here for metal-working, pottery production (a kiln), and a small bath, and systematic excavations at this site, which may determine whether it is an extensive rural village or a villa with spacious outbuildings, are planned. From Castiglione di Ragusa, an indigenous centre in contact with Gr Camarina, which earlier has yielded two Ionic cups scratched NENAAX (Kokalos 18-19 [1972-73] 184), has come another Ionic B2 cup from clandestine sources inscribed Red6rai emi, presumably a Sikel personal name but with a Gr verb, indicating a certain bilingualism in the 6th cent BC (F. Cordaro, BdA6 lxxviii.80-81 [1993] 155). NORTH-EAST SICILY Provinces of Messina and Catania At Catania, the creation of a separate archaeological Superintendency in 1992 has undoubtedly led to an explosion of activity, especially in the province, on a scale not seen in this area for many decades. In Catania itself, work continued until 1992 at the extensive site under and in front of the former Monastery of the Benedictines, now owned by the University (AR 1987-88 117). Superimposed on an earlier late-Republican- /early imperial phase, to which belonged houses boasting opus signinum floors with white tessera inlay and plastered walls, came a LR building with an entrance flanked by a pair of brick columns. The street alongside was paved with great slabs of basalt: this and another street parallel to it are the first elements of the street-grid of Roman Catania ever to have been recovered. Inside the former monastery, under its N hall, a large domus with simple black-and-white mosaics, and also a geometric polychrome mosaic in red, yellow, blue and white, with a ribbon-pattern border, were also discovered; the quality of the floors is such as to suggest the hand of local Sicilian mosaic ateliers rather than mosaicists imported from continen- tal Italy. The date falls in the 2nd Ct AD, and again there are remains of a late Republican house or houses beneath. This was clearly prime residential land in R times, where the hill-top location with fine views and cooler air was no doubt much in demand. Another wealthy domus is suggested by the remains uncovered in via Crocifero in the heart of the ancient town close to the R theatre, where part of the corridor of a house with geometric black-and white mosaics has been found, together with an entrance stair down from the street, a marble- paved niche which might have served as a lararium, and one white marble column fallen from the presumed ancient peristyle, which still lies buried under an adjacent 18th Ct palazzo. A white marble Ionic capital, a headless female statue, and the base of a another (with part of its foot) were also recorded here. In the R theatre, excavations have resumed since 1992/3 and have located the level of the orchestra, which is marble-paved; work is also proceeding in the area of the scaenae frons. A fresh initiative, long overdue, is the total refurbishment of the Castello Ursino museum (which is currently closed); a city the size and importance of Catania has always deserved rather better for its museo civico. Excavation below floor-level prior to strengthening work for the foundations has revealed traces of a brick-vaulted early medieval structure, possibly a kiln, and a rectangular industrial building, which pre-date the construc- tion of Castello Ursino in 1239; one of the finds was a Byz seal ascribed to the 8th Ct AD. Below, material of the last decades BC and the first five centuries AD was found, including polychrome painted wall plaster (apparently Julio- Claudian). Below that again, Gr layers were encountered, including walls of the 4th Ct BC; material which is earlier still included an Attic Band cup from the Little Master group (A. Patane, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 901). In the N part of the city (Grotta Petra Lia), a Castelluccian cemetery has been discovered, with no grave goods as such, but lots of offerings adjacent, especially of pottery. One burial, laid straight into the bare earth and then covered by stones, belonged to the EBA S. Ippolito culture. All this is a welcome addition to our scanty knowledge of prehistoric settlement in Catania and its immediate environs (reviewed by E. Procelli, Kokalos 38 [1992] 69). A casual find elsewhere in Catania is that of a R battered marble head found near (but unconnected with) the important S. Francesco votive deposit of 1959 (G. Rizza, BdA5 45 [1960] 247). Full publication of the latter is in progress by Catania's Istituto di Archeologia, under the direction of Professor Filippo Giudice (cf. AR 1987-88 117). Among other discoveries Dr M. Frasca has published a curious bronze statuette, in very rudimentary style, of a divine couple, perhaps an amulet, which came from a pit in Catania with predominantly 4th/3rd Ct BC material. Similar examples are known in Catania (in Castello Ursino and in a private collection), and another from Centuripe is now in Syracuse; others are known from Calabria. The date is problematical. Is this a deliberate LC/EHL harking-back to the stylised images of their Sikel forebears, or are these genu- inely 8th-Ct or 7th-Ct BC artefacts which, judging from the archaeological context at Catania in which they were found, must be regarded as residual'? (M. Frasca, BdA6 lxxxvii.76 [1992] 19). In the territory of Catania a number of important prehistoric sites have been investigated. The most significant is S. Febronia near Palagonia, where five imposing EBA chamber tombs of a Castelluccian necropolis have been explored, the first to be found in E Sicly with its funerary assemblages undisturbed by tomb-robbers. Three of the tombs also have vestibules with the circular or square tomb-chamber behind; one produced a rare copper alloy dagger of triangular shape, of which the closest parallels are with the Tarxien cemetery on Malta, and so possibly documenting contact between Sicily and the Maltese islands in the period c. 1600/1400 BC; a jade pendent was also found with it, and has given rise to specula- tion that some sort of post-burial funerary ritual was carried out here (on the use of jade in prehistoric Sicily in general, see R. Leighton and J.E. Dixon, Oxford Journal of Archaeology 11 [1992] 179). At least one of the tombs was re-frequented in the IA, on the basis of fragments of an 8th-Ct oenochoe (L. Maniscalco, in Leighton, Early societies, 81; ead., Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 881; BCASicilia n.s. i-ii.2 [1991-92] 13; Minerva 3.2 [1992] 18). Also near Palagonia are Acqua Amara, an EBA and MBA settlement explored in 1983 (M. Frasca, CronASA 22 [1983, publ. 1991], 83), and Petralia, a site investigated by Orsi, with scattered skeletal material in caves, and some pieces of disarticulated skeletons placed in crevices in the rock. The pottery belongs largely to the Piano Conte culture. In contrada Marineo at Licodia Eubea, a cave with a series of signs and solar symbols is interpreted as a N habitation site (BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 61). In contrada Marca near Castiglione di Sicilia, emergency excavation in 1989 revealed a cave with burials of late Copper Age/EBA date (Piano Conte and S. Ippolito type pottery) (BCASicilia n.s. i-ii.2 [1991-92] 21). Near Mineo, in contrada CamutiPiano Vattano, has been uncovered a pair of EBA circular huts 7m in diameter; associated finds included a mould for ring-making</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 and what is interpreted as an unusual clay female 'idol', 44cm high (F. Valenti, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 909). Near the salt spring of San Marco near Patern6, excavation initiated in 1994 and 1995 by Dr L. Maniscalco for the Catania Soprintendenza, at a site known hitherto only for its important surface finds, has revealed the remains of an EBA village; the N material (high-quality Serra d'Alto ware) remains unstratified. A circular hut enclosed within a wall has been uncovered, with late Castelluccian pottery within (1800-1400 BC); pithoi stood outside in the court (AJA 100 [1996] 356). Of particular interest is the IA site at Castello S. Filippo, just inland from the coastal resort of Aci Castello, where, in addition to Thapsos cups and other indigenous painted wares, there is also Gr material of the second half of the 8th Ct, including Attic LG, EPC and Euboean (Chalcidian?) pottery. Since the earliest LG seems to be around the middle rather than the later 8th Ct BC, we may have here another example of pre-colonial Greek activity to add to key sites such as Villasmundo (but cf. above): might this material document Chalcidian Euboeans prospecting for a potential settlement site (cf. in general on Chalcidian penetration inland, E. Procelli, MEFRA 101 [1989] 679)? Full publication of this pottery is eagerly awaited. Also of great interest is the modest excavation in contrada Casalros- ato near Valverde, on the southern approaches to mount Etna 9km N of Catania. A dump of material here went from the 4th/3rd Ct BC (coins of Agathocles and Hieron, Gnathian style pottery) back to the 7th Ct; some sherds, however, are undoub- tedly as early as the late 8th Ct, equal to the earliest in Catania itself, and an indication, perhaps, of an early desire to control as much of the fertile territory around the city as was feasible. Among the early material were EPC fragments, the lip of a Thapsos cup, and a clear local copy of an Aetos 666 kotyle (F. Privitera, BCASic ix-x.3 [1988-89] 80). Similar early pottery, including apparently LG and EPC, is reported from the Pietralunga ridge 25km W of Catania, and again demonstrates the early penetration of newly-settled Greeks inland (B.E. McConnell, AJA 100 [1996] 356). Greek-native interaction is also a key theme of interest in the excavations on Monte San Mauro near Caltagirone, where Orsi's investigations were followed up by important fresh campaigns in the A settlement by the Syracuse Soprintendenza in the 1970s and 1980s (AR 1981-82 91; 1987-88 119). In 1990 Dr F. Valenti opened a new area at the summit of 'hill 3' where Orsi's anaktoron lay, in the hope of elucidating the function of the adjacent building dubbed the 'magazzino' by Orsi. In the event, the excavations threw less light on the A Gr settlement than on the preceeding phases: Castelluccio pottery, broken pieces of baslat hand-mills, a basalt pestle and associ- ated post-holes were found to lie below the 'magazzino', while further N an elliptical hut of uncertain prehistoric or proto- historic date was discovered. Another hut, also elliptical (with a maximum diameter of 7m), furnished with a bench along part of one wall, was uncovered to the NE, and was partly overlain by the anaktoron. The finds from this second hut, which included pithoi, local painted geometric pottery, and traces of bronze-work- ing, placed occupation in this hut firmly in the period between the mid-8th and the mid-7th Ct BC. A thick burnt layer over it indicates that the hut was destroyed by fire, assumed by the excavator to have been violent as a result of 'conquest' by the Geloans (F. Valenti, BCASicilia n.s. i-ii.2 [1991-92] 15); but as in all these cases of burning coincidental with the arrival of Greeks, the possibility that it formed part of a site-clearance operation before the erection of the anaktoron remains open. Another key site, long known (Dunbabin, WG 126), with important material at the interface between IA indigenous material and the earliest Gr imports, is Licodia Eubea, where in contrada Serpillizza (SW of the modern town) 21 tombs, some with multiple burials, which had escaped the destructive attentions of the clandestini, were explored in 1989 in a necropolis otherwise largely lost to archaeology. Three are HL (fusiform unguentaria) but the rest belong to the period c. 675-640; these grave goods included, apart from pottery, fragments of jewellery, a hard stone from a ring, bronze and silver objects, and, most unusually, items of amber. The pottery contained lots of local wares alongside Gr imports: PC kotylai (and one PC cup), oenochoai believed to be Euboean, and two small Argive oenochoai (E. Tomasello, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 61). The full presentation of the tomb groups, and an indication of the proportion of Gr imports to native in each tomb, are eagerly awaited; but the quantity and quality of the Gr imports, and the frequency of Euboean (Chalcidian) imports, has renewed speculation that the Sicilian sub-colony of Euboia (Hdt. 7.156) does indeed lie below the modern town which still bears its name (pace Dunbabin, WG 128 and Manni, Geografia 174, who both place it somewhere S of Lentini). In another necropolis here, in contrada Calvaria, 22 6th-4th Ct graves not emptied by Orsi (NSc 1897, 327) were excavated in 1989. Of other indigenous hill-top settlements of the interior, excavations have at last commenced at Monte Iudica (542m), perhaps the ancient Noai, a site which dominates the Dittaino valley to the W and the plain of Catania to the E; it has, though, been the preserve of the clandestini since Orsi's brief foray there ninety years ago (NSc 1907, 489; BCTGI X 378). Two long campaigns by Dr F. Privitera for the Catania Soprintendenza in 1988 and 1991 found well-preserved parts of two A houses inside the settlement, with their stone walls still standing up to an astonishing height of 2.70m. Also in situ were hundreds of pottery vessels, discovered where they were left when this quarter was abandoned c. 500 BC, perhaps as a result of Hippocrates' campaigns. The settlement as a whole, however, must have survived into the early Empire, if Monte Iudica really is Noai, since Noini appear in Pliny, NH 3.91. One of the houses has at least six rooms, one with a row of three pithoi along one wall, and a bench along another with amphoras and other pottery: this room alone contained more than 60 individual ceramic vessels. Most are local, but there are some imports, including Attic bf (a Band Cup of the 560s, for example). The main period of urban development appears to belong to the 6th Ct BC, and surface finds of fragmentary Gorgon antefixes suggest contemporary shrines as well. Part of a necropolis with abundant grave goods was also investigated, mostly of 6th/5th Ct BC date: tombs a ca'ppuccina predomi- nate, covered by piles of stones (an unusual feature among Sicilian burial customs), with grave goods both inside and outside the grave proper; most were local, but there was at least one apparent Attic bf lekythos of the early 5th Ct with palmette decoration. Four bronze strigils and a strainer with swan's head handle (of a type known also at Licodia Eubea: P. Orsi, Mitteilungen des DAI, Riimlische Abteiliung 24 [1909] 64, fig. 4) were also among the finds from this necropolis. Monte Iudica looks like falling into line as yet another indigenous hill-centre progressively hellenised in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, possibly under Chalcidian influence from the coast like Morgantina, which lies a little further inland (F. Privitera, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 85; ibid. n.s. i-ii.2 [1991-92] 26). Also dominating the W side of the Plain of Catania, a little to the S of Monte Iudica, is the site at Montagna di Ramacca. Here Dr E. Procelli of Catania University has proceeded to the full publication of his work in 1978-82, and furnished us with 75</page><page sequence="18">76 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 10 a preliminary note on further excavations in 1984-86 (NSc 1988-89, I Supplemento [publ. 1994] 22; SicArch xxi.66-68 [1988] 73); there were also further investigations at Ramacca in 1989, directed by Dr A. Patane (BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 94). Here a newly recognised indigenous centre on the edge of the plain of Catania, rapidly hellenised in the course of the 6th Ct BC by contact with Katane and Leontinoi or both (and with a little help from Gela too), has been firmly put on the archae- ological map. Gr pottery and local imitations of Greek become plentiful in the second half of the 7th Ct. A substantial house of c. 600 was destroyed by fire, apparently violently, 50 years later: Leontini's expansionism has been blamed. The 6th Ct BC Gr imports contain few surprises: Ionic cups (B2), Attic (group of the Polos painter), and gorgon antefixes indicate a Greek- -style naiskos there from the early years of the 6th Ct. Excava- tion in 1984 revealed what remained of the latter after clandes- tine despoliation: less than half remained of a two-roomed shrine 16.75m long, violently destroyed, like the house, c. 550 BC. Below one house levels of Finocchito culture, and lower still, of Castelluccian culture, have been revealed. The necrop- olises have been largely destroyed by the clandestini, but a fragment of gorgoneion of c. 525/500 BC, of a different type to those already known from the site, was picked up on the edge of the E necropolis in 1989, while near the W cemetery, on the summit of a low hill, surface fragments of A and C statuettes prompted an excavation. This revealed a deposit with smallscale votive oenochoai and numerous female protomai and statuettes, some shown standing and holding a pig. It looks as though yet another sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, so numerous all over archaic and classical Sicily, has been detected here. Another hill-top settlement under renewed investigation is at Monte Balchino, near Caltagirone, where the Syracuse Soprintendenza carried out excavations in the 1970s and 1980s (U. Spigo, BTCGI III [1984] 203). Here a short tract of the N defences, 2m wide, has been uncovered as well as a four- roomed house just inside, replaced by a two-roomed one in a secondary phase. Both house phases and the fortifications belong to the 6th Ct BC. Two chamber tombs in the S necrop- olis, extensively sacked by clandestini, have been cleaned: they have side benches and contain as grave goods mostly local pottery of c. 500 BC. The hilltop seems to have been aban- doned in the mid-5th Ct BC and not subsequently occupied (G. Lamagna, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 875). Other sites where excavation has been carried out include those in contrada S. Venera at Bronte (numerous circular huts and rectangular buildings of c. 550-300 BC, with later R occupation: A. Consoli), contrada Impero at Calatabiano (a Gr and R rural site: F. Privitera); contrada Favarella near Caltagirone (indige- nous tomb of 6th Ct BC with rich grave goods: F. Valenti); and Terravecchia di Grammichele, a long-known site (Dunba- bin, WG 122), where total expropriation and the creation of an archaeological park to protect the zone is under consideration (excavation in 1988-89 was conducted in the Sikel-Gr necrop- olis and revealed three main phases in the settlement: A and C; HL [both phases yielded several terracotta statuettes: BCASiic- lia ix-x.3 (1988-89) 58, figs. 1-3]; and 16th and 17th, prior to destruction by the earthquake of 1693: E. Tomasello). Of all the indigenous settlements in this region, one of the most important and indeed most extensive is the key site in contrada Mendolito near Adrano, where first Orsi (cf. Dunba- bin, WG 132) and then more recently Pelagatti conducted excavations: the latter found there the longest Sikel inscription yet known (AR 1976-77 70). Renewed excavations in 1988-89 by Dr Gioconda Lamagna for the Catania Soprintendenza concentrated on an area just inside and NE of the S gate uncovered by Pelagatti (BdA5 51 [1966] 89), and found partial remains of rectangular houses, built in the local black-basalt rubble and occupied in the 6th and early 5th Ct BC (G. Lamagna, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 70; ead., BdArch 16-18 (1992 [1995]) 255; ead., Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 873). The most plentiful pottery was of the indigenous Licodia Eubea variety, with brown painted decoration; a large number of forms (amphoras, hydriae, trilobed oenochoai, two-handled scodelloni) were identified. Ionic B2 cups, probably made in one of the Sicilian Greek colonies, were also present, and other imported ware included some pieces of Attic cups and skyphoi and Cor kotylai and transport amphoras, albeit in small quantities. Careful examination of surface finds within the Mendolito settlement has also led to the identification of two probable sanctuary areas, one N of the S gate, the other in the NW sector; the evidence from the former includes a fragmen- tary gorgon antefix (Fig. 10) and fragments of astragal moulding, probably all of c. 500 BC Other fragments of antexfixes from the site have also been recently published (R.M. Albanese Procelli, SicArch xxiii.73 [1990] 7). The style is similar to that of other gorgoneia found in the hinterland of the Chalcidian colonies of the east coast, whence the coroplasts responsible for their manufacture were presumably based, although clay analysis suggested to Albanese Procelli that they might have been actually manufactured at Mendolito (ibid. 9). Also reported from the A necropolis of Mendolito (contrada Sciare Manganelli) is the chance find of a bronze helmet of so-called 'Chalcidian' type, dating probably to the early years of the 5th Ct BC (R.M. Albanese Procelli, SicArch xxi.66-68 [1988] 31). Dr Albanese Procelli has also now published in full (MEFRA 101 [1989] 643) the important bronze fragments of G tripod legs imported from mainland Greece, found in a hoard at Mendolito as long ago as 1908, but only recently recognised for what they were. The significance of this exceptional discovery was already noted in AR 1987-88 118: they are the first of their type documented in the West (Fig. 11). The two oldest of the three are probably of Peloponnesian manufacture, and belong to the first half of the 8th Ct; but because they might have arrived in Sicily rather later than this as scrap</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 77 Fig. 11 Fig. 12 metal, they cannot be added with complete confidence to the slender catalogue of material witnessing 'precolonial' activity in Sicily. The hoard to which they belonged, 900 kg in weight, is now also published in admirable detail, together with bronze hoards from a dozen other sites in central and eastern Sicily housed in Syracuse Museum (R.M. Albanese Procelli, Riposti- gli di bronzi della Sicilia nel Museo archeologico di Siracusa [Palermo: Accademia nazionale di scienze, lettere e arti di Palermo, 1993], pp. 344; 109-207 for the Mendolito hoard). At Adrano, in contrada S. Alfio, a trial excavation by Dr G. Lamagna for the Catania Soprintendenza in 1990 in Adranon's W necropolis (extensively ransacked by clandestini) revealed eight inhumation burials, of which five had not been disturbed (SicArch xxiv.76-77 [1991] 47; BCASicilia n.s. i-ii.2 [1991-92] 18; Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 875). Three were simple deposi- tions, the other two were covered by roof-tiles (a cappuccina). Grave goods were generally unspectacular, the best being the tomb (no. 5) of a woman accompanied by six pots and a copper alloy sewing needle. All the burials date to the 4th/3rd Ct BC. The most intriguing find, however, was unstratified-a fragmentary olpe of c. 400 BC, with a graffito in Doric Greek 'sacred to Heracles' (Fig. 12), so providing further evidence for a cult of this hero in Adranon, already documented by an inscription found by Orsi (Rivista di Storia antica 5 [1900] 43). Another HL necropolis has been investigated in recent years (1987-88) in contrada Rione S. Ippolito near Mineo (cf. A. Messina, CronASA 10 [1971] 118 for earlier work here), where 208 tombs, nearly all inhumations either placed in the bare earth or in wooden coffins, and virtually all with grave goods, were excavated in 1987-88. The grave goods, apart from pottery (of which there were plentiful piriform and fusiform unguentaria), included some unusual pieces: a mirror silvered on one side, a gold leaf, an iron strigil and a pottery kernos. Some of the graves used amphoras as surface tomb-markers, several still (rather surprisingly) in an excellent state of preservation (E. Tomasello, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 61) . Nor have the R and later periods been neglected in Catania's territory. The enigmatic site at S. Venera al Pozzo near Acireale (AR 1987-88 117; Wilson, Sicily, 226-8) has been safeguarded by the creation of a 12-ha archaeological park; while at Capo Molini, hitherto best known for its R temple (NSc 1952, 341), but which has always seemed a likely candidate for something larger (probably the statio of Acium on the Catania-Messina coastal road: It. Ant. 87.3), mid-R, LR and Byz walls were uncovered in 1988 a short distance away from the temple, indicating that indeed the latter did not stand alone; Byz coins from the Syracusan mint of Heraclius II (630-41) and Leo (813-20) are also reported (P. Marchese Viola, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 66). The area is now swallowed up by modern development, but antiquarian reports talk of a 'city' here with 'ruins of every kind' (A. Holm, Storia di Sicilia III, 449-50). A previously unsuspected R imperial site marked by abundant surface sherds of ARS in contrada Grande near Mineo was trial trenched in 1988-89 by Dr E. Tomasello to assess plough damage (BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 61); and the discovery of a LR three-apsed hall at contrada Pirrone near Licodia Eubea (ibid. 60) presumably heralds the discovery of another substantial LR villa, since dining rooms of this type are only so far known in Sicily at the grand LR villas of Patti Marina and Piazza Armerina. Excavations have also commen- ced at last on the R bridge long partially visible at Pietralunga 3km W of Paternb (cf. Wilson, Sicily, 14 with pl. 12b): the S abutment and access ramp with paved roadway, as well fragments of an arch in mid-stream, and part of the N abutment under a modern structure, have now been freed and made more visible. No date has been offered more precise than c. AD 0/150 (presumably predecessors were wholly of timber); there is a hint from post-holes that the superstructure of this stone bridge may also have been partly of wood (M.G. Branciforti, AJA 100 [1996] 357). The bridge which Houel illustrated in the eighteenth century (Wilson, Sicily, pl. 12a) is apparently not this one but another about 3km downstream in the neighbour- hood of Centuripe, a bridge which has also now been located; and a third R bridge is reported from the territory of Belpasso, about 10km E of Paternb. Clearly extensive fieldwork in the area to trace the course of the R road system hereabouts (not</page><page sequence="20">78 R. J. A. WILSON easy among the heavily-cultivated lemon- and orange-groves) is badly needed. At Paterno itself a small extra-urban basilica with an apse 8m wide has been dated to the 5th/early 6th Ct AD in its first phase (a fragmentary marble relief was among the finds), with a later rebuilding in the 12th Ct. Along with the other newly-discovered example at Heraclea Minoa (see below), this discovery provides a welcome addition to the number of paleochristian churches known in the island. Another gain is the study of the tiny Byz chapel (9.40m x 5.67m) with single nave and an apse, of uncertain date within the 6th/8th cents AD, at Imbischi near Randazzo (S. Giglio, SicArch xxv.80 [1992] 49). At Messina the most extraordinary discovery was made in 1992 in contrada Camaro, 2kms W of the city, during excavation of a couple of hearths and a burial belonging to the Piano Conte culture. Outside the amphora containing the burial was found an idol, 12cm high, in a grey, fine-grained schist, which, on the basis of closely comparable shapes in the well-known series of Cycladic figurines, is apparently datable to between 3,200 and 2,700 BC (G.M. Bacci, Kokalos, 39-40 [1993-94] 171). Notwithstanding the use of schist rather than marble, Dr Bacci thinks Cycladic manufacture likely, although links with Anatolia have also been claimed (not least because the idol has rudimentary arms); Dr S. Tusa, on the other hand (ibid. 180), thinks it must be Sicilian-made, although the possibility that it was made in imitation of yet to be discovered imported Cycladic or Anatolian models remains open. In Messina itself excavations S of the port have found remnants of EBA Rodi-Tindari culture, including huts and enchytrismos burials nearby. Other traces of occupation of the same date have been found in Isolati 135 and 146, and a huge contemporary cemetery is known along the Boccetta torrent in the area of the Palazzo della Cultura, excavation of which has been proceeding since 1992 (G. Tigano): it is clear that the EBA settlement at Messina was of very considerable extent. In via La Farina (Isolato 158), where traces of EBA settlement were also found (including animal bones in which, interesting- ly, cattle predominated over sheep/goats), an excavation in advance of building found that virtually all A Gr levels had been destroyed, but 12 pits produced late 8th, 7th and 6th Ct BC pottery, including two E Gr bird bowls, late Thapsos cups, a little EPC and Rhodian, and some local (?) imitations of Phoenician red slip plates. These finds inter alia tend to confirm that the nucleus of the A and C Gr city lay S of the harbour as far as the present via S. Cecilia, with the A city being possibly slightly larger than its C successor (on the topography of Messina, taking account of finds up to 1986, see the important contribution of G. Scibona in Lo Stretto: crocevxia di cultura: atti del 26" Convegno di studi sulla Magna Grecia 1986 [Taranto 1987, but in fact published in 1993] 433). Close to the coast, in via Industriale (Isolato T, via Maddalena-Industriale), a portion of an arterial road 6.20m wide has been found; it relates to a late-6th Ct BC street plan. The earliest sherds here go back to the late 8th/early 7th cent, but this earliest city seems to have been reshaped c. 500, although the open spaces of the earliest city were respected in the rebuilding. Among other chance finds in this same general area are a 5th Ct BC pottery kiln with central support, and one of the 3rd Ct BC too; a 3rd Ct BC cup inscribed YFIEIAY; an HL terracotta of a kissing couple lying on a bed; and a most unusual small square panel in limestone with what is taken to be a tree and a betrl carved in relief: if so, this is a rare Carthaginian find from Messina, probably at the time of the Mamertine occupation of the city. A substantial stretch of the Mamertine walls with large ashlar blocks up to four courses high has also been uncovered in via S. Marta on the W side of the city; 25m long, it is 5m wide and is pierced at one point by a drainage channel. In Isolato Z (via Torino, near the railway station), parts of two well-preserved 4th Ct BC houses were discovered, amalgamated in the 3rd Ct into a single habitation with a central courtyard and rooms around. Stray earlier finds from here include some fragments of 8th Ct BC Thapsos cups and a Silenus antefix of the 6th Ct. The site has been saved from destruction and there are plans to make it accessible to the public - a welcome addition to the paltry visible relics of ancient Zankle/Messana (G.M. Bacci, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 924; ead., Mediterranean archaeology 5-6 [1992-93] 15). In 1989 in the gardens of the Palazzo della Giustizia, 7m of stratified deposit with material from Gr to Byz was excavated, including LR brickwork structures and a medieval tile kiln. But the most spectacular gain fiom recent excavations at Messina is an intact Sicilian rf krater of c. 340 BC from the Manfria Painter, showing a scene from the comic theatre on the main side (perhaps a parody of Euripides' Ion), which was found in 1989 in a necropolis on the W side of Messina, in via S. Marta. Also from Messina (church of S. Maria Alemanna) is a fragment of lekanis from the Lipari painter, the first to be found in the Straits of Messina. Both are published by Dr Umberto Spigo in a detailed discussion of nine Italiot and Sicilian rf pieces in the Messina museum, along with a fragmentary HL theatrical mask of the type turning up in such numbers on Lipari (U. Spigo, Mediterranean Archaeology 5-6 [1992-93] 33; id., QuadMusMess 2 [1992] 9). We may also note here a full and scholarly publication of 36 Rhodian and Cnidian amphora stamps in the collections of the Messina museum (L. Campagna, ibid. 29). Recent monographs on Messina include S. Greco, Messina primiti'a: dalle oriigini alia pri7ma gliuerra pu)nica (Messina 1986), pp. 225; id., Messina Cantica dallia ])rilma glue'rrai punica all'avvento dei NorInlnni (Messina 1991), pp. 187; and, for the coins, M. Caccamo Caltabiano, LLa monetazione di Messana (Berlin 1993), pp. 383. There is much of value too in the long entry by G. Scibona on Messina in BTCGI X (1992) 1-65. In the S outskirts of Messina, in the Pistunina district, a building development has led to the controversial destruction of what looks to have been a luxury LR villa, the marble columns and architrave fragments of whose peristyle were hastily dumped in the sea before the archaeological authorities could intervene. Press reports have been further dramatised by speculation that this was the villa of Saint Melania, where her entourage watched the burning of Reggio Calabria by the Visigoths in AD 410 (Patrologia Graeca XII.583-6). A substantial base of concrete nearby, cut in half by the bull- dozers, may belong to a funerary monument of some preten- sions. This sorry state of affairs has prompted the Soprinten- denza to initiate excavations in the immediate surroundings of this discovery, and although the luxury part has probably gone for ever, details are emerging of the modest structures of the outbuildings of an agricultural village or villa of R date, extending over a little under 4ha, starting in the 2nd Ct AD and continuing until a stratum of alluvial soil buried the site c. 425/30 AD. A five-roomed structure and small cistern along- side it belonged to this phase, probably an 'agricultural' building (a stable?); pig and sheep/goat predominate among the animal bones, with cattle less well represented, and a few chickens too; horse and dog occur rarely. An Etna basalt flour mill, a sickle and a small hoe, as well as a complete ARS dish with stamped decoration (Hayes 67), were among the finds fiom the alluvial destruction layer. That did not, however, mark the end of life in the settlement, because another extensive</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 village of 6th-7th Ct date succeeded it; what are assumed to be contemporary a cappuccina burials, but without grave goods, have been found associated with it (G.M. Bacci, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 941). The sequence sounds remarkably similar to the situation at both the great LR villas at Piazza Armerina (EN) and Patti Marina (ME), where considerable agricultural villages grew up in and around the collapsed villas and lasted into Byz times and (in the case of Piazza Armerina) even later. For Naxos we now have a clearer picture of the extent and longevity (N-IA) of occupation on Capo Schis6 before the arrival of the Greeks, with a full catalogue of the prehistoric material found in excavations at Naxos since 1953 (E. Procelli, CronASA 22 [1989, publ. 1991] 9). It seems likely that the peninsula was still occupied in 735 when the first colonists arrived, but whether the former left peacefully or had to be ejected by force is not clear. Meanwhile, recent excavations continue to shed fresh light on the archaeological topography of the Gr colony. On the E slopes of the Larunchi hill NW of the Castello, on the N side of the known city street-grid (to be precise at the junction of stenopos 6 with plateia C), an area 50m wide (E-W) has been shown to be free of buildings: it has therefore been tentatively identified as the site of the agora. The oldest levels here go back to the last decades of 8th Ct BC. An extensive tract of 5th-Ct BC houses has also now been excavated (Fig. 13), in isolato 4, S of and adjacent to Plateia C; comprising 14 houses in all, they constitute a most welcome addition to our scanty knowledge of domestic housing of high classical date in the entire Greek world: Naxos, along with Himera, now has some of the more intellible examples of its type. The excavated houses occupy half the insula's width (the other half remains to be dug); individual houses are separated by ambitus. The width of the houses is constant at 18.40m (56 Doric feet), but they vary in length (N-S). Excavation in 1989-92 concentrated on the southern part of the area shown in Fig. 13. Houses 11, 12 and 13 are more or less identical in size, measuring 9.2m x 5.5m. By contrast house 14, the largest to be explored, measures 19m x 17m and occupies the full width of the half-insula; it has a proper entrance ftuces (on the W) and a threshold of white limestone, a stone rare at Naxos, where Etna basalt is the normal construction material. The hoard of 22 late 5th Ct silver tetradrachms, found in 1985, which came from the N end of this isolato, marks the destruction of these houses, and of Naxos as a whole, by Dionysius I in 403. Other finds included two fragments of pinakes belonging to the first decades of the 5th Ct, the first of Locrian type to be found at Naxos: this in itself is interesting, in view of the fact that the Francavilla site, which was producing plaques of very similar type, lay only only 26km away to the NW (M.C. Lentini, Xenia 20 [1990] 5; ead., Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 1001). West of the Gr city, on far side of Torrente S. Venera, a large extramural sacral complex has become better known as a result of recent work. First identified in 1975/77 (and published in full, along with much else from Naxos, by P. Pelagatti, NSc 1984-85 [publ. 1988] 253), the excavated area has now been greatly enlarged, and the site named after the two proprietors of the terrain as 'santuario Scalia-Maloprovvido'. Remains of two shrines in antis (H and I), and an E-W terrace wall between two parts of the sanctuary (wall K), as well as a peribolos wall further N, running N-S (wall J), have all been identified here. Sacellum H, consisting of simple cella and pronaos facing E, measures 15m x 7 m, and is dated by Ionic cups and MC pottery fragments in the foundation layers to c. 580/570 BC. Part of a decorated terracotta sima survives, with single guilloche decoration (on show at the Venice exhibition of 1996: Western Greeks, 639, no. 55), and also tongue Fig. 13 decoration below a chequerboard pattern; these match exactly pieces published earlier and found very close by (C. Ciurcina, CronASA 19 [1980] 179). Sacello I is also very simple, consisting of cella with pronaos in antis, facing S; it lies 300m S of shrine H; dated also to the first half of 6th Ct, it measures 14m x 7m. An inscription to the goddess Eny6 was found in this general area in the 1970s (M. Guarducci, MEFRA 97 [1985] 7). Now the excavations have turned up the terracotta head of a female goddess with helmet (Athena?), belonging to the early 5th Ct, giving rise to speculation that this Athena type and the indigenous goddess Enyo are one and the same; only further discoveries will tell. The life of the sanctuary does not seem to have continued beyond the mid-5th cent, but two altars of late 5th/4th date attest later activity. A potters' quarter lies 79</page><page sequence="22">80 R. J. A. WILSON 0 s 10 Fig. 14 immediately to the N, of mid-5th Ct BC date (a circular kiln, 6.20m in diameter, is among discoveries here), and excavations also took place in 1992 in another parcel of land W of the S. Venera torrent, in a votive deposit near the modern SS. 114, in proprieta Cooperativo Sole Nascente. This inter alia yielded a Silenus antefix of the late 6th Ct, another fine product of the Naxian coroplastic workshops, which were in demand as far afield as Lentini and Syracuse (Western Greeks, 639 no. 59). Among material from earlier excavations, the energetic Dr Lentini has published a selection of amphoras and hydriae from 7th-6th Ct BC levels, mostly from necropolises: they indicate a flourishing local production of hydriae with wavy bands on the shoulders from the end of the 7th Ct BC onwards, with an exemplary catalogue of various other pieces, including LG Corinthian, Euboean cups and skyphoi, and PC vessels (M.C. Lentini, BdA' lxxvii.72 [19921 11). Dr Lentini has also published an odd type of oenochoe with cut-away neck, with very simple linear or wavy line painted decoration, another example of Naxian pottery production of the second half of the 7th Ct BC (BdA6 lxxvi.60 [1990] 67). Likewise it is to Dr Lentini's prolific pen that we owe the publication of graffiti on the bottom of cups, one reading Arch&lt;i&gt;kles of c. 500, the other Eudramon of c. 400 (BdA6 lxxiii.48 [19881 15; cf. also M.T. Manni Piraino, Kokalos 33 [1987] 21 for other Naxian graffiti). Dr F. Cordano has published (ibid. 18) two irregular balls of fired clay inscribed with further names: IOAAIAI, nIPQTAPXOZ, EIIKPAT[I]O, EPMONAAI; 'ONOMOZ- TATOZ and EFAMENOZ. Both balls date to the 5th Ct; they may correspond to local phyle and phratria names, and represent real or fictitious family names for dividing up Naxos' citizens, similar to the system attested or suspected elsewhere in Sicily, at Camarina and Selinus (M.T. Manni Piraino, Iscrizioni greche lapidarie del museo di Palerimo [Palermo 1973] no. 68); but this is not certain. Nor must I omit mention here of another important discovery of wider than purely local significance for Sicilian R studies. Material from the LR kilns excavated in the 1970s in the R roadside settlement at Naxos (contrada Mastrociccio) has never been published (for the kilns, A.M. Fallico, Kokalos 22-23 [1976-77] 632; Wilson, Sicily, 256, fig. 212), but now some of the amphora wasters (Fig. 14) firom these kilns have been examined by B. Basile. who has shown that the type being produced was alnphora form Keay LII (Rassegna sltbacqltea VI, 25). This was thought by Dr Paul Arthur to have a Calabr- ian origin (Journial of Roimnan Archaeology 2 11989] 133), but it is now to be recognised as a Sicilian container, perhaps the successor in the LR and early Byz periods to the Naxian wine amphora of Riley's 'Middle Roman 1' type, which had earlier had an Empire-wide distribution (Wilson, Sicily, 264, figs. 224-5), and which like the later version was also a flat-bottom- ed amphora. The Keay Lls, which are now getting recognised on various sites in E Sicily. including Punta Castelluzzo near Augusta (see above) and Avola (the R villa in contrada Borgellusa), also had an extensive, if mainly coastal, distribu- tion, as far W as Gaul and Spain, and as far E as Greece and Turkey (Arthur. op. cit. 138. fig. 3). The discovery clearly has important repurcussions for the significance of the Sicilian wine ? trade among the markets of the Mediterranean in the 5th and 6th Ct AD. At Taormina, on the hillside above Naxos, work has resumed on the substantial town-house with 2nd-Ct-AD mosaics, uncovered during the 1980s (AR 1987-88 121-2): the S end of the peristyle and three rooms opening oft'f it on this side have been discovered now (as predicted in Wilson, Sicily, 126); each of the new rooms has a niche in its back wall. The peristyle has now been shown to be of 7 x 4 columns; a small rectangu- lar fountain basin was built towards the S end of the open area (a garden?) enclosed by the peristyle. The house was aban- doned and partly buried in the LR period; not before the 5th Ct AD, the area was inhabited again by wretched structures of dry-stone walling. Fragments of HL walling of structures preceding the do&amp;tus have been identified in test-pits under the mosaic pavements. A little to the N of here, in Piazza S. Pancrazio, a semicircular wall long visible has been shown indeed to belong to a suspected late-imperial bath-building (cf. M. Santangelo, Taorminat e dintorni [1950] 75), of which parts of seven rooms, some heated, and two axially-arranged horse-shoe-shaped hot-water baths, survive. Test soundings revealed earlier R and HL levels below: the area was continu- ously occupied from the time of Taormina's foundation onwards. From these pre-bath layers came a fragmentary Siceliot rf crater of c. 350/300 BC, with a scene of a Dionysiac thicsos, and, from an early imperial context, fragments of fresco painting depicting ducks and nymphs. Close by, a small emergency excavation beneath the sacristy of the church of S. Pancrazio has enabled the precise dimensions of the cella of the HL Temple of Serapis (Wilson, Sicily, 105, fig. 95.1) to be established at 14m x 9m. Other work at Taormina, generally rescue excavation in advance of development, has revealed inter alia an important cistern deposit with material from the late 1st Ct to the beginning of the 3rd Ct AD (Italian sigillata; a fair quantity of Gaulish sigillata, especially forms Dr. 29B and 37, one with the name-stamp of Patricius; Eastern sigillata A and B; lamps; glass bottles; and small bronze implements together with the remains of iron slag, indicating metalworking activity, presumably in the vicinity). Another cistern deposit yielded late HL material, including Dressel 1 amphoras and fragments of tiny model ships (toys? votives?). Finally, in via Di Giovanni, near the Naumachia reservoir, a third cistern deposit (found close by some fragmentary rooms with mosaics and opus signinum floors) has produced marble cornices and capitals and a magnificent tragic mask (meles aner type?) in stucco, presumably part of the decoration of a private house. Measured by what we know elsewhere in the island at this time, Tauromenium in its prime, during the early and middle</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 empire, was clearly quite a place (G.M. Bacci and C. Rizzo, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 945). Of Tauromenitan inscriptions, 0. Salomies has looked again at the fragments of Fasti consulares (the only attested example in Sicily), unearthed in the excavation of the public baths in the 1960s and again in 1984 (AE 1988, 626a), and has drawn attention to certain unexplained oddities in the Sicilian list, such as the reversing of the order of that usually given for the suffect consuls for 36 BC, and the replacement of M. Antonius by L. Atratinus as cos. ord. for 34 (the latter had been active in Sicily in 37-36 during Octavian's campaigns in the island) (ZPE 86 [1991] 187; AE 1991, 894; on these fasti cf. also J. Rupke, Kalendar r und Offentlichkeit. Die Geschichte der Repriisentation lind religiiisen Qualitikation von Zeit in Romn [Berlin and New York 1995] 133-8). G. Manganaro has also subjected the thirteen well-known HL 'financial' inscriptions of Taormina (IG XIV 423-30) to renewed scrutiny, in what amounts to the first detailed modern discussion of the whole group (in D. Knoepfler and N. Quellet, eds., Com1ptes et invent- aires la cite greccque [Neuchatel and Geneva 1988] 155). At Francavilla di Sicilia Dr U. Spigo resumed excavations in 1989-1991 for the Messina Soprintendenza at four further localities in the immediate vicinty of the sanctuary site, which was the focus of work in 1979-84 (Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 1039). In proprieta Cacciola fragmentary remains of houses of three different phases were uncovered, principally of the 6th and 5th Ct BC, with some 4th/3rd Ct additions. An archaic kiln, im in diameter, was found on the N side of this site. A group of four rooms further S produced plentiful 6th-Ct pottery, especially of the mid-6th Ct, including a lekythos of Samian type and 3 Ionic B 1 cups. The 5th-cent layers included coins of Syracuse and Leontinoi. This site was abandoned by early in the 4th Ct BC, and to the 3rd Ct only a single inhumation burial belonged. Other finds include part of a gorgon antefix of the last quarter of the 6th Ct, and two fragments of draped female statue in terracotta belonging to the late 5th Ct. In proprieta Panarello-Di Marco, a single inhumation tomb of c. 450/440 BC was found in a box of clay slabs. The skeleton had completely dissolved in the acid soil, but there were plentiful grave goods: bg skyphoi (types B and C), oenochoai, three jugs, and an alabastron; there was also a grotesque statuette representing a dancing satyr, as well as others depicting a dove and a seated female goddess. Chance finds from this area included a bronze jug, probably of c. 475-450 BC. The character of this settlement, the exploration of which is hampered by modern housing, is still not entirely clear: it may be a small agricultural village which happened to contain a sanctuary of unusual character, or it may have been principally a sanctuary site, and the present round of excava- tions is uncovering ancillary buildings of a secular nature which formed part of the support services for the shrine. To the W of Messina, in the waters off Capo Rasocolmo, an ancient shipwreck has been discovered at a depth of 8m. The ship's timbers have perished, but nails, metal sheets, ten examples of bronze stylised birds, which functioned as dents decorating the side of the vessel, an iron anchor, and 15 lava millstones (more metae than catilli, none of them making a pair) have all been found. The millstones must therefore be ballast, and in the absence of any cargo the vessel is surely a warship. A bronze anchorage bolt was discovered in the prow with a large ring attached to it. Masses of lead items fused together suggest that the vessel perished in a fire. Twenty lead sling slot (glandes), 49 bronze and silver coins, mostly Sicilian issues of Sextus Pompey of 45-36 BC, or else coins of Pompey the Great and Carisius of 46-42, and a bronze lunate strip with the punched inscription, CN [P?] MAGNO, are also among the finds. The ship looks therefore to have been a victim of one of the many naval encounters off the NE coast of Sicily in the period of 38-36 BC. Certainly this isolated find is no cause to relocate the site of the battle of Naulochus, usually reckoned to have taken place in the Gulf of Milazzo some 30km further W; but speculation has been raised that the ship was an escapee fi-om the Naulochus battle, trying desperately to get to Messina when it was intercepted (G.M. Bacci, V Rassegna subacqllea 227; VI Rassegna 115). Further west again, at Milazzo, the resumption of excavation activity under the direction of Dr Gabriella Tigano of the Messina Soprintendenza has resulted, apart from the discovery of an EBA village in the Piano district SE of the modern town (contrada Ciantro), where there were close links with Rodi-Tin- dari culture, in the uncovering of a fresh tract of necropolis, with grave goods datable between c. 550 and 380 BC. The burials, all on the same level strung out along the road leading S from Mylai, were of the various usual types for this period: simple cuts in the earth, graves lined with tiles or mud bricks, tile-covered tombs propped gablewise ('a cappuccina'), and amphoras to contain ashes or the bodies of infants. Among the latter are attested Etruscan amphoras in the 6th Ct, Massiliot and Chiot in the 5th, and later Punic cylindrical amphoras. Grave goods were few. Rather later in date is a newly-excava- ted section of necropolis in contrada S. Paolino (1990), on the SE side of Milazzo, with inhumation burials encased in tile containers, and a few secondary cremations. Grave goods were inside and outside the graves. Balsamaria were the most common pottery type, followed by unguentaria; the chronology is 3rd/2nd Ct BC. Particularly remarkable were the coroplastic finds: an askos of Magenta ware (production of which has most recently been ascribed to Syracuse) in the form of a goose, identical to one from Centuripe; three models of boats (dis- cussed in detail by G. Tigano in IV Rassegna, 51; cf. B. Basile, ibid. 11 for other examples in E Sicily; and for a review of askoi and other Sicilian plastic vases, see B.H.M. Heldring in M. Gnade, ed., Stips Votiva: papers presented to C.M. Stibbe [Amsterdam 1991] 73). Numerous burials were made in cylindrical lead pyxides of a type known elsewhere in E Sicily. The gold earrings from Tomb 23, with animal head protomai, not later than 3rd Ct BC, are exquisite, and a welcome addition to the comparatively few examples of earrings from HL Sicily known from secure contexts (see also Marsala, below). In contrada S. Giovanni, in the S outskirts of the town, another excavation (in 1992) revealed 140 burials of all types (from bare depositions in the earth, through burial in amphoras or pithoi, to slab- or tile-lined graves, and to containers with mud-brick walling); all were inhumations, but the acidity of the soil prevented good bone preservation. The dates ranged from the mid-6th to the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. Grave goods were modest, except for a mid-5th Ct BC lekythos depicting a seated woman. The amphoras used for burial show a wide range of types and illuminate commercial contacts at this time between Mylai and the wider Greek world: Corinthian, Laconian, east Greek, Etruscan and Punic are all represented, as well as amphoras made in other western Greek cities ('Ionic-Massaliot' type, Lipari 469, etc.) (G. Tigano, Kalos vi.1-2 [1994] 32; Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 1059). On Lipari in the Aeolian islands, the excavations and publications of the indefatigable L. Bernab6 Brea, and of his collaborator Dr M. Cavalier, have continued with undiminished vigour. Two further stretches of the Greek defences on the S side of the city have been uncovered, one badly robbed in the LR period (possibly to furnish building blocks for repairs to the 81</page><page sequence="24">82 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 15 acropolis defences), but the other surviving to a height of three or four rows of blocks, together with a projecting tower; the latter was possibly part of a gate tower. Dramatic evidence for the destruction of Lipari by the Romans in 252/1 BC was discovered, with a mass of catapult balls, iron arrow-tips and lead sling-slot. In the same excavation, in a somewhat later level, a hoard of 329 bronze coins, mostly from the mint of Lipari, but with a dozen Carthaginian issues, was also uncovered. Traces of the less substantial fortification, thrown up by Sextus Pompey at the time of the civil wars in the 30s BC, was also found outside the 4th Ct BC defences, as in stretch already known and visible in the Archaeological Park. Further traces of R destruction debris from the attack of 252/1 have also been uncovered (1991/2) immediately outside the town, where a large dump comprised plentiful debris from the clean-up operations after the attack. Another hoard, this time of 68 coins, was discovered here: interestingly only 6 came from the mint of Lipari, whereas 50 were struck at Carthage, perhaps a reflection of Lipari's importance as a Carthaginian naval-base in the struggle against Rome during the first Punic War. Also outside the city (in contrada Sant'Anna) has been found a huge refuse tip from a pottery works of late 1 st cent/2nd Ct AD date, including amphora wasters. The amphora type appears to be form Richborough 527 (= Peacock and Williams form 13), a type long ago characterised from examples found at Richborough in Kent, and since then recognised quite widely on sites in southern England, in France, and more rarely in Italy (Fig. 15 left: from the bay of Cassis, S France; centre: from Rennes). Examples are known from a wreck site off Lipari (Fig. 15 right: Punta di S. Francesco: Parker, Ship- wrecks, no. 936), but the type has yet to be securely identified on the Sicilian mainland, where they must surely occur plentifully: the danger of confusion with Punic cigar-shaped amphoras, also with shoulder handles, is considerable. Dr Paul Arthur suggested a possible Campanian production centre, but it looks now as though the Richborough 527 amphora was made on Lipari. This is certainly in keeping with the petrologi- cal make-up of Richborough 527, which suggests 'an origin in an area of both marine sedimentary rocks and, in view of the well-preserved volcanic glass, of recent vulcanism' (D.P.S. Peacock and D.F. Williams, Aimphoras and the Roman econ- omy [London 19861 112). Whether it was designed to take alum, a specialised product for which Lipari was famous, indeed in which she controlled a monopoly in the Roman world (Diod. V.10.2), or agricultural produce such as wine or oil from an island whose considerable fertility is derived from its volcanic soil (but no specific ancient testimony praises either this or the island's agricultural produce), is not entirely clear; but tests on examples of Richborough 527 in London, where (incidentally) they are known still to occur well into the 3rd Ct AD, indicate that they carried at least both wine and oil. The discovery opens up a new dimension for Sicilian (and in particular Liparan) trade in the R period, with exports reaching as far as England (as did also another Sicilian amphora, Riley's 'Middle Roman amphora 1', which carried Naxian wine to, among other places, Canterbury: Wilson, Sicily, 264, and see above, on Naxos). In the same Lipari deposit were found also Dressel 2/4 amphoras, whether as wasters or not is unclear; but a Sicilian production centre or centres of these amphoras, to add to those many other places where they are known to have been made (in Italy, Gaul, Spain and Tripolitania), would not be surprising (cf. Wilson, Sicily, 264). Further excavations at the site of this waster tip are planned. Also in the suburbs of Lipari, near via G. Franza, a small bath-building belonging to a 2nd-Ct-AD Roman suburban dwelling has been identified. In the necropolis a further hundred tombs have been exca- vated; one of them (tomb 2287) had a lebes gamikos of the Mad Man Painter associated with lekanaii in the manner of the NYN Painter and a Pagenstecher lekythos. Statuettes of a nude Aphrodite came from other tombs. In another sector (proprieta Mirto), excavations in 1992/93 revealed tombs from the 6th Ct BC to the LR period. The latter (coins of Valens and Valentin- ian I) were very impoverished, but the chance find of a damaged marble head, identified as Julia, daughter of Titus, hints at a greater affluence in earlier R times. Of particular interest among the many new discoveries in this necropolis were two unusual child burials of c. 425/50, in small versions of the 'bath-tub' terracotta sarcophagus, lying side by side (tomb 2516), and another inhumation inside a pithos (tomb 2514). Both these tombs were furnished with numerous lively statuettes depicting various scenes of domestic life (mothers washing and feeding babies; girl seated on a bull [Europa'?], etc.), which are iconographic novelties in the coroplastic art of Sicily at this period; whether they are imports from Rhodes or Tanagra, where such scenes can be paralleled, or are the products of a Sicilian coroplast, tabric examination may be able to resolve. Another tomb (2515) consisted of a cremation deposited within a late 4th Ct BC rf krater in the style of the NYN painter, placed in a container with walling of mud-brick. The krater, one of the biggest found in Lipari, depicts on its main side four male banqueters, a female flautist and a dwarf in padded theatrical costume with phallus; Pan and a satyr are also in attendance (side B shows Eros advancing towards two young women). It is not clear yet whether it is of Italiot or Liparan production; here the regular assistance over many years of the late Dale Trendall, in helping the excavators with the interpretation of their latest discoveries, is being sorely missed, as all over south Italy and Sicily. A round-up of the advances in knowledge over the decade 1982-92 (and therefore in part covering discoveries briefly noted in AR 1987-88 122) has been provided by M. Cavalier (RA 1993, 205), and another by her and L. Bernab6 Brea in Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 993); a hundred-page resume of current knowledge on Lipari can be found in BTCGI VII (1990) 81-185; and there is also a summary of twenty years of</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 research in English (and therefore useful for Italian-less undergraduates) by M. Cavalier in Mediterranean Archaeology 5-6 (1992-93) 5-13. F. Villard has contributed a note (RA 1993, 213) about local pottery production, and observed that through- out the 6th and 5th Ct BC there is a lot of good-quality pottery, including vases with painted bands (especially oenoch- oai and skyphoi), 'Ionian' B2 cups, and bg cups, skyphoi etc. which are in the same distinctive fabric (pale brown, very fine, with some minuscule pieces of mica) identical to that of rf works by the Lipari Painter in the 4th Ct BC; so it seems that there was active pottery production on the island from soon after Lipari's foundation c. 580. This situation is all the more remarkable if the clay (if current orthodoxy is correct) had to be imported in its entirety from the N coast of Sicily. This really does not make sense, and flies in the face of the raisonls d'etres of pottery industries of all periods the world over: a good local source of clay is a sine qua niion for the success of any pottery operation (and also, in the R period, for amphora production: see above). Surely fiesh geological study of the island will in the future locate hitherto unsuspected clay deposits. The publication output of L. Bernab6 Brea and M. Cavalier continues happily unabated. A new museum guide has been published in the Musei di Sicilia series (L. Bernab6 Brea, M. Cavalier and U. Spigo, Lipa-i. II Museo eoliano [Palermo: Novecento, and Rome: Libreria dello Stato, 1994], pp. 148). A definitive excavation report (Meliguiis Lipdira V: scavii nella iecrop)oli greca di Lipara, Rome 1991), dealing with tombs excavated between 1973 and 1985, follows very much in the same mould as its companion volume Meligunis Lipdba II (Palermo 1965); most of the finds date fiom the 5th to the 3rd Ct BC, with a little late HL and early imperial. The Liparan soil does not deal kindly with human remains, but anthropo- logical aspects have not been totally ignored: what little can be said has been published by M. Capitano (Archivio Stoiico Messinesee 40 [1990] 69). The rest of the unpublished tombs (proprieta Zagami, etc.) are due to be published in Meligunims Liptira VII. A foretaste of the full presentation of material from the LR tombs in this necropolis, together with the plans of mausolea, is provided in the context of a most useful general survey of the Aeolian islands in late antiquity by L. Bernab6 Brea, Le isole eolie dal ttardo antico ai Normanni [Biblioteca di Felix Ravenna] (Ravenna: Edizioni del Girasole, 1988, pp. 176), which publishes inter alia the first piece in Sicily of LR te-rra sigillatat grise pottery, imported from southern Gaul (ibid. 59, fig. 3). Meanwhile, students of Greek comedy will want to reconsider some of the conclusions in Bernab6 Brea's earlier path-break- ing publication, Menandro e il teatro greco nelle terracotte liparesi (Genoa 1981), in the light of the discussion by David Wiles in The malsks of'Metnande (Cambridge 1991), who sees in the Lipari material a rather wider range of mask types than Pollux's catalogue will allow. Bernab6 Brea's views were summarised by him in a paper given in 1992 (Mediterranean Archaeology 5-6 [1992-93] 23), unaware of the appearance of Wiles' book; in it he announces the imminent publication of another book by him on the same theme, Maschere e person- aggi del teatro greco nelle terracotte liparesi. Two further masks of c. 400/350 BC, featuring Hecuba and Talthybius from Euripides' Hecuba, have come from the recent round of excavations (1992/93) in the necropolis (tomb 2486) (Kokalos 39-40 [1994-94] 995). Away from Lipari town (8km to the W) lies the extraordinary thermal complex at San Calogero, claimed by Professor Bernab6 Brea and Dr Cavalier to have its origins in the LBA (AR 1987-88 124-5 with fig. 22). Excavations have now uncovered a vast and well-preserved bathing complex of R date, adjacent to the surviving domed buildings, and include a hall 9.30m x 5.20m originally covered by a barrel vault now collapsed. It enclosed a swimming pool, 6.60m x 2.85 m, approached by four steps all the way round, an arrangement familiar from R spa buildings throughout the R world (Bath in England, Fordongianus in Sardinia, Aquae Calidae in Algeria and Djebel Oust in Tunisia spring to mind, to take four examples at random). It was built apparently at the end of the 1st Ct AD and was destroyed by a violent earthquake, believed to be the famous one of AD 365 (on which see Wilson, Sicily, 185-7). which damaged but did not destroy the adjacent LBA tholos. Some patching up and the construction of a new water channel for the tholos followed, but the baths did not regain their former glory (L. Bernab6 Brea and M. Cavalier, Kokalos 39-40 11993-941 998: cf. also E. Acquaro et al., eds., Momenti preco'lonliali iel Mediterrnill eo tlanti-o IRome 1988], 109: Stldi 1mi'enei /ed egeo-anCttolici 28 [19901 7: L'eaut, 11 sante et la imaltclie cdalrs le imnoide grec [BCH Supplement 28, Paris 1994] 169). The scale and impressive nature of these works provide some archaeological confirmation of the popularity of the spa, already noted by Diodorus (V.10.1) in the Ist Ct BC. Elsewhere in the Aeolian islands, on Salina, a hitherto unsuspected N settlement was identified and partly excavated in the Rinicedda district; it dates to the last centuries of the 5th millennium BC, and so is among the earliest yet recognised in the Aeolian Isles. An oval hut 3.50m x 2.50m contained numerous nuggets of obsidian and a great quantity of flakes, demonstrating that obsidian working had been carried out here. The pottery is of Stentinello type, with some bichrome painted ware indicating contacts with S Italy. Other prehistoric settlements have been identified on Salina at Megna (EBA, Capo Graziano culture), Serro Brigadiere (principally at the end of Copper Age/EBA, Piano Quartara culture plus early Capo Graziano wares) and Serro dell'Acqua (also late Copper Age/EBA). R material has been identified at Lago di Lingua, site of both ancient and later salt evaporation works, and where Houel (Voyage Pittoresquc e cdans les le. tde Sicile, cde Lipari et de MaLlte 1781-861 III, pl 68) recorded R walling in the eighteenth century (M. Cavalier, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 987). These and earlier researches on the island of Salina will be reported in full in Meligunis Lipdir VIII. to be published not by L'Erma di Bretschneider but by the Accademia nazion- ale di Scienze, Lettere e Belle Arti di Palermo; the manuscript is almost ready for the press. Houel's fascinating account of the Aeolian islands, incidentally, is now available, in an Italian version of the relevant section of the larger work, as J. Houel, Viaggio pittoresco alle isole eolie (Marina di Patti: Pungitopo 1987, pp. 78). Elsewhere in the Aeolian isles, the decades-long collaboration of L. Bernab6 Brea and M. Cavalier has produced another major volume in the Meligunis Lipara series, a culmination of their work on the island of Filicudi: their Meligunis Lipdir VI: Filicudi, insediamenti dell'etd di bironlo (Palermo 1991), will long remain as a definitive statement of BA settlement in that island. Off Panarea, at the Panarelli rocks, the wreck site noted in AR 1987-88 125 was further investigated in 1988, when four Dressel 1B wine amphora necks were raised from the seabed (M. Bound, IJNA 20 11991] 43). This is the second Dressel 1 wreck known from the Aeolian Isles, to add to that known at Punta Lucia, Vulcano (Parker, Shipwrecks, no. 1229). Mensun Bound has also written a useful, readable and hand- some introduction to the Archeologia sottomarinia alle isole eolie (Marina di Patti: Pungitopo 1992, pp. 148), which surveys 83</page><page sequence="26">84 R. J. A. WILSON its subject right down into modern times, as well as providing many details about, and colour illustrations of, both underwater sites explored by others, and ancient wrecks he has dived on himself, such as Dattilo (AR 1987-88 125; add now also BCASicilia vi-viii.2 [1985-87], publ. 1989, 61 for full presenta- tion with profiles of the pottery from this wreck). Returning to the Sicilian mainland, we may note a number of places along the N coast where fresh work is uncovering new evidence for all periods from remotest antiquity to medieval times. The extraordinary site at Acquedolci, with its mass of Upper Palaeolithic animal bones of wolf, bear, deer, elephants and hippopotamuses between half and one million years old (AR 1987-88 125), was the subject of a special exhibition at Messina in 1989, the catalogue of which is Ippopotami di Sicilia. Paleontologia e archeologia nel territorio di Acque- dolci (Messina 1989, pp. 123). At Capo d'Orlando (probably the R Agathyrnum: Wilson, Sicily, 157), a portion of 3rd Ct BC necropolis was excavated in 1989, but the main recent concentration of work in this area has been in contrada Bagnoli S. Gregorio, 3km NE of Capo d'Orlando, where excavations by Dr U. Spigo for the Messina Soprintendenza have been proceeding since 1987 at a LR bath-building belonging probably to a villa (Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 1027). Pottery at this site goes back to the late Republican period, but none of the excavated structures are before the 3rd Ct AD, and the main nucleus, consisting of three rooms with hypocausts, seem to have been built and been in operation, on the basis of pottery, in the 4th and 5th Ct AD; in addition to plentiful ARS at little Phocaean red slip pottery from Asia Minor (LRC ware) has also been found here. The walls of the building are of the local flysch Capo d'Orlando stone, with white plaster rendering on the exterior; there are floor mosaics with polychrome geometric designs. The baths were destroyed in an earthquake, which made the roof fall in and the floors on their pilae collapse into their basements. The date of this catastrophe is unclear, but it is perhaps the same as that which destroyed the villa at Patti Marina, the 'Basilica' at Tindari, and possibly the S. Calogero baths on Lipari, probably c. AD 400 (Wilson, Sicily, 187, 206; although the S. Calogero earthquake - see above - has been provisionally assigned to 365). A trial trench uphill from the bath-building in 1991, S of the railway-line, found a wall which might belong to a villa, but the possibility that the site is a roadside mansio on the N coastal road has not so far been ruled out. About 70m W of the baths five inhumation burials have been located; as there were no grave goods, their date is uncertain. Further W, inland from the N coast, at Caronia, emergency excavation in 1992-93 in contrade Sotto S. Francesco and Pantano revealed a series of well-preserved walls in trenches too narrow to make much of the building plans to which they belong; they seem to be part of a hill-top settlement, the date of which falls in the late HL to early R imperial periods, i.e. from the 3rd Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD (C. Bonanno, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 953). Nothing earlier or later was found, so the problem of the whereabouts of Kaleacte (Hdt. 6.22) remains open. Later R occupation seems to have concentrated on the coast at Marina di Caronia: as so often (Wilson, Sicily, 154-7) the hill-top centre seems to have been abandoned during the early Empire. The same probably also holds true for S. Marco d'Alunzio, the ancient Haluntium, where little system- atic archaeological work has ever been undertaken (AR 1981- 82 95; Wilson, Sicily, 149-50) In 1990 and 1992, however, emergency intervention in contrada S. Marina just N of the town revealed 19 tombs of a HL necropolis dating to the late 4th and first half of the 3rd Ct BC, all but one inhumations with grave goods at the foot of the deceased. The one excep- tion is the first primary cremation burial found at S. Marco d'Alunzio. Finds included bg cups and a guttus, piriform unguentaria, a strigil, and 20 knucklebones (of terracotta'?) in one burial (that of a child). In the Regione Catorelli just outside the 4th-Ct BC urban defences, walls of a building of 1st Ct BC/AD, and a cistern, appear to belong to a fairly extensive late HL extramural quarter, indicating perhaps that at that period Haluntium had outgrown its early HL walled circuit (C. Bonanno, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 975). If so, the expan- sion was premature, because Haluntium was before long in decline, and it vanishes altogether from the epigraphic and archaeological record after the I st Ct AD. CENTRAL SICILY Province of Enna In Enna, the splendid new archaeological museum (AR 1987- 88 134) now has a handy guide (E. Cilia, II museo archeolog- ico di Enna, 1989), and the Punic coins have also been catalogued (E. Acquaro, ed., Monete puntiche ielle collezioni italiane. Parte 2. Enna, Museo comnunale G. Alessi; Romca, Collezione Viola [Rome 1994], pp. 99). In Enna itself there is not much to report except for HL pottery in an excavation at the church of S.

Cilia, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 921). I have not seen a recent monograph, presumab- ly largely historical, by A.M. Corradini, Enna: storia e mitologia: attraverso le fonti classiche (Enna: Papiro, 1991), pp. 132. In the environs of Enna several hill towns have been the target for continued or renewed exploration. At Rossomanno (AR 1987-88 134), work has concentrated in the E necropolis, where the archaic Rocca Crovacchio cemetery in 1988 yielded a bronze necklace and a fine bg column crater with two swans and an owl, probably Cor. Many graves are a cappuccina with tiles propped up gable-wise; the grave goods consist mainly of coarse pottery, but touches of a more luxurious lifestyle are suggested by a core-formed glass aryballos in one grave (Tomb 2), and of a silver brooch in another. Particularly unusual are the circular tombs here, with a mass of stones covering the burials, and so too is a row of little altars next to another group of tombs: are these indicative of Sikel burial customs? At another hill-top town, Monte Artesino, near Nicosia, where there have been no excavations since Bernabb Brea's in 1951, a section of fortifications, still 2m high, has been uncovered on the N side, as well as a few rooms belonging to archaic houses in the NW sector, still standing up to 1.50m high; but the most significant discovery on the acropolis is that of fragments of large terracotta antefixes, approximately life-size, showing the head of a male bearded divinity, possibly Zeus. The style is clearly HL and points (hardly surprisingly) to a sanctuary on the acropolis at this date (E. Cilia, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 919). On the hill-top of Centuripe, on the other hand, which is still a bustling modern town, opportunities for excavation are more limited, but this is a place which seems to have slum- bered archaeologically since Libertini's pioneering work (G. Libertini, Centuripe, Catania 1926). Although, for example, a new museum has been in preparation for many years, there is no sign of its imminent opening. Some things have, however, been happening of late (R. Patant, SicArch xxi.66-68 [19881 93). In 1987 (localita Panneria) an unusual R hypogeic</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 16 funerary monument, partly ransacked by the clandeStinli, was investigated, and in the Addolorata district a R structure intriguingly interpreted as a weapons factory was partly uncovered during road widening. In the same year demolition of the old Mulino Barbagallo took place, affording the possibil- ity (not so far exploited) for extending the excavation area of the so-called Augustales site (G. Libertini, NSc 1953. 353), which I have suggested may be the agora/forum of Centuripe (Wilson, Sicil\, 113). At Morgantina Professor E. De Miro (University of Messina) and Dr G. Fiorentini of the Agrigento Superintendency have continued their work (through kind permision of Dr Cilia), even though now the site falls outside Agrigento's jurisdiction. Work has been continuing in the SW quarter of houses on the western hill. A NE-SW street. coming from the NW corner of the agora. has been uncovered. A series of four rectangular chambers side by side have also been explored, with material of the 6th to 4th Ct BC; adjacent was a new pottery kiln, in a good state of of preservation. A rock-cut cistern has been emptied, largely containing pottery of the 2nd/lst Ct BC (E. Cilia, Kokaclos 39-40 11993-941 920). Professor De Miro has also provided a handy and copiously illustrated IntrlIoduilone al Museo( di Morgantinin in Aidone (Palermo 1985), pp. 60. The most significant general study of the HL city, however, is that attempted by the school of architecture at Palermo University, which in A. Sposito et ctl. Morgantina: architettimra e citta ellenistiche (Palermo: Edizioni Giugno for the Dipartimento di Progetto e Costruzione Edilizia, Universiti di Palermo, 1995. pp. 152) has provided us with a wealth of detailed planimetric and axionometric documentation which marks a real advance is our understanding of the missing third dimension (the superstructure) of most of the structures excavated: the book deals systematically with each building, public and private, in turn. and includes also an analysis of types of walling employed at Morgantina. A sample of their work is included here as Fig. 16 ('The house of the Doric capital') and Fig. 17 (the macellumi). This is a handsome volume of permanent value. Other studies on material fi-om Morgantina which fall outside the ambitious programme of American work at this site include Professor G. Manganaro's publication of six lead Fig. 17 C,. tablets fiom Morgantina of the 3rd Ct BC, now in Ragusa, which concern the purchase of land and/or houses (PdP 44 119891 189: SEG XXXIX, 1008-1013); and G. Tagliamonte's identification of a bronze belt-hook (probably dating to the second hallf of the 4th Ct BC, and decorated with a figure of Hercules). as being of 'Samnite' type, to add to other central Italian pieces of imported military hardware, already identified in Sicily at Monte Casale di S. Basilio, Agrigento and Marsala. Whether the item indicates a central Italian element in Morgan- tina's population at this time, or rather presupposes the presence of Italian mercenaries, is an open question (Archeo- logii cIissica 45 119931 293). Meanwhile. the work of Professor M. Bell and his collabor- ators in preparing the American excavations for publication continues fol-ward at a steady pace. Fieldwork in recent years has concentrated on surface survey of the surrounding territory. which started in 1992 and continued in 1993 and 1994. followed by a study season in 1995. In 19 weeks of fieldwalking nearly 40km- has been covered and 145 sites located. but preliminary conclusions about the ebb and flow of settlemient patterns are not yet to hand (S.M. Thompson, AJA 10() [1996] 357). Among studies of the already excavated material, pride of place must go to two further volumes in the Mora('11tina Studies series. Volume III, by N. Cuomo di Caprio. Fornaci e officine da vl 'asio ttardo-ellenisticlIe (Prince- ton 1992, pp. 192 + 65 plates) is a detailed study of ten kilns belonging to six potters' workshops discovered between 1955 and 1963 (cf. also ecad., Rei cretariae RoimartCeii Fal ttoritu Actci 31-32 11992] 105 tfor a somewhat inconclusive mineralogical analysis of eleven sherds of terra sigillata, not the first time that this pottery has proved intractable): while Volume IV of Morgantinai Studies. by R. Leighton. The p.rotohistoric settle- imenrt on the Citttadell (Princeton 1993. pp. 24() + 164 plates), not only documents with meticulous care those excavations on this hill which concern the 10th to early 7th Ct BC, together with a faultless catalogue of more than 700 finds, but also places Morgantina in its wider setting at this period (127-61), t~~~~~~~~~U t · r·~~ 1L ~I  85</page><page sequence="28">86 R. J. A. WILSON a synthesis which is of far-reaching importance for proto- historic studies in Sicily. The same author has also published the axes and other ground stone tools from Morgantina and similarly set them in their wider south Italian and Sicilian context (Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 55 [1989] 135). We may also note Claire Lyons' stimulating and challenging account of Sikel burials at Morgantina (in Leighton, Earlh societies, 177), who has demonstrated that, even after the arrival of Gr artefacts at the site (which is not necessarily always to be equated with the arrival of immigrant Greek settlers), the Sikel element of Morgantina's population man- aged to maintain a distinctive identity in such things as dress and personal jewellery, and the practice of multiple inhumation burial in chamber tombs. Among other aspects of Morgantinan archaeology, which has produced such a fruitful harvest of detailed information over so many years, C.M. Antonaccio and J. Neils have published a graffito on a Laconian bf krater fragment of c. 550 BC, inscribed Kwotpa Ec £, and speculate that Kypara, who also occurs on loomweights from Terravechia di Cuti and is used by Hesychius (2.3) when referring to the spring of Arethusa at Syracuse, is the name of a Sikel deity, and emi the Sikel version of Greek E£t1 (ZPE 105 [1995] 261). Dr Neils is also preparing a study of the Attic pottery from the site, the figured examples of which show a preference for Dionysiac scenes. An rf krater attributed by Beazley to Euthymides is among the finds, as well as a second one now attributed to the same painter (AJA 96 [1992] 367). Dr I. Edmund-Berry is studying the central sanctuary near the theatre, a modest example of its genre, which survived the sack of Morgantina in 211 BC (ibid. 367; ead., Scienze dell' antichitei 3-4 [1989-90] 328). P.W. Deussen has written on the granaries in the lower agora of Morgantina in the context of the suitability of its territory for fruitful cereal production, and suggests that the massive granary, almost 93m long (just short of a hemi-stadion), with impressive buttressed exterior (cf. Livy XXIV.21.11-12 for the imposing appearance of the royal granaries on Ortygia), may have been a gift to Morgantina from Hieron II, as an encour- agement (if such were needed) to collect the tithe in accord- ance with the lex Hieronica (in Ravitaillement en ble, 231). Professor S.C. Stone is studying the HL pottery medallion bowls from the site, of which 150 examples are known, with 26 different relief tondi; closely imitating contemporary metalwork, they are at the height of their popularity in the 3rd Ct BC (AJA 96 [19?] 367). We may also note further prolegomena to J.F. Kenfield's forthcoming monograph on the architectural terracottas. The roof material from an archaic naiskos and adjacent building on the Cittadella has been subjected to detailed scrutiny, and links proposed with E Gr work from Miletus and Didyma as well as with other sites, including Naxos and Messina in NE Sicily (Hesperia 59 [1990] 265): Kenfield so defines the artist personality of a master coroplast trained in East Greece, and he suggests he may have arrived at Zankle in the 490s with other Ionian refugees invited by the Zancleans to join in founding Kale Akte (Hdt. 6.11; Thuc. 6.4.5). Professor Kenfield has also given us a facinating glimpse of the later architectural terracottas from Morgantina (in N.A. Winter, ed., Proceedings of the international confer- ence on Greek architectural terracottas of the Classical and Hellenistic periods [= Hesperia Supplement XXVII], Princeton 1994, 275): the archaic gorgoneion antefix was abandoned in favour of a female head in higher relief, whom flanking snakes indicate is a Medusa. The type continues on into the HL period, with a heightened sense of wild-eyed dementia: these later antefixes, in a high baroque style probably derived from 3rd-century-BC Syracuse, are among the finest examples of HL sculpture from the site, and show that Sicilian coroplastic artists were still capable of performing at the same high level as their archaic and early classical predecessors. It is of course above all the HL city, and especially its private houses, which make the principal impact on a visitor to the site today, and it is good to know that publication of Barbara Tsakirgis' Morgantina Studies VI: the domestic architecture of the hellenistic and Roman periods (Princeton, due late 1996), is imminent. For a foretaste of its likely quality, she has served up a splendid hors d'oeuvre in a pair of articles on the floor mosaics, both in tessera technique with or without figured decoration, and in opus signinum (AJA 93 [1989] 395 and 94 [1990] 425; cf. also ibid. 96 [1992] 368). She has also pro- vided a most helpful outline reconstruction of the fortunes of the city, as reconstructable by the archaeology, with plentiful illustration (in Fischer-Hansen, Sicily 123). At Piazza Armerina, a museum in Piazza Gregorio, long planned to house the finds (which have never been on display) from the famous R villa in the Casale district nearby, is said to be nearing completion. At the villa itself there have been no recent excavations, but inevitably fresh studies have been offered on various aspects of this marvellous site, seemingly inexhaustible in its fascination for scholars. The most signifi- cant publication is a study from the Palermo architectural school which has also given us a sister monograph on Morgan- tina (see above): A. Sposito et al., Natura e arteficio nell'icon- ografia ennese: architettura, arte e ambiente nelle fonti litterarie-artistiche dal V sec. a.C. al sec. VII d.C. (Palermo: Edizioni Giugno for the Dipartimento di Progetto e Costruzione Edilizia, Universiti di Palermo, 1995, pp. 136), which despite its curious title is exclusively concerned with the villa, with essays from various hands on, inter alia, the architectural context, the iconography of the mosaics, the entrance area, mosaic borders, and the depiction of animals and of villas on the various floors of the great mansion. Other studies on Piazza Armerina include detailed discussions of the iconography of the Small Hunt mosaic (F. Ghedini, Mitteilungen des DAI, Rimi- sche Abteilung 98 [1991] 322) and of the Dionysiac imagery on the great triclinium mosaics (S. Sande, Acta ad Archaeolog- iam et artium Historiam; pertinentia n.s. 7 [1989] 23). Also Professor Z. Kadar (in M. Restle, ed., Festschrift fir K. Wessel [Munich 1988] 139) has for the first time tried to identify zoologically all the fifty-odd creatures which are depicted on the Orpheus mosaic at the villa: he points out the rarity of some and re-identifies others, such as the 'armadillo' of J.M.C. Toynbee (Animals in Roman Life and art [1973] 293), which must be the scaly ant-eater known in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. All this suggests that Roman zoological knowledge extended both to these regions and to tropical Africa, but quite how these creatures entered the artistic repertoire, presumably in mosaicists' copybooks (via illustrated bestiaries?), remains to be satisfactorily explained. At the nearby site of Sofiana, the ancient Philosophiana, which some would like to link closely with the Piazza Armer- ina villa, excavation has resumed after a break of over 25 years. The new work, directed by Dr Francesco de la Torre took place in 1988 and 1990 after pilot trenches in 1986. The intention is to re-study and publish in full the work of Dinu Adamesteanu of 1954 and 1961 (summarised in Wilson, Sicily, 223), and to open new areas to enlarge our knowledge of this facscinating settlement. On the N side of the settlement, on the scarp overlooking the plain, a considerable E-W wall, 0.60m wide, has been traced for 40m, interrupted at intervals by other small structures. It is interpreted as a 'defining' wall of the</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 87 settlement, not a defensive wall as such (it is too narrow), beyond which the depositing of rubbish was permissable. It seals early imperial material, including Dressel 2/4 amphoras, lamps, glass and pottery, giving a date for its construction not earlier than the early 2nd Ct AD. Further S a peristyle house has been uncovered bordering a paved street 3m wide, with rooms floored in opus signinum; one room has this inlaid with white tesserae to form a rosette motif. The date is early in the imperial period, thus confirming what I have suggested elsewhere (Wilson, Sicily, 116), that this style of opus signinum floor with inlay, which passed out of fashion in central Italy c. 50 BC, lingered on in Sicily (as well as in Sardinia and probably north Africa) well into the imperial period. In the centre of the peristyle was a plastered fountain basin with central vertical pier (still with its lead pipe) for the water-spout. The roof of the house, with tiles of the curved 'imperial' type (Wilson, Sicily, 269), one stamped L. Sei(i), collapsed at the end of the 3rd Ct and was replaced by other structures at a higher level (G.F. La Torre, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 765). Also at Sofiana, twenty new tombs in the E necropolis (BdA5 1963 259; RAC 40 [1964] 169) were excavated by the Soprint- endenza in 1993, all of them built of walling, sometimes plastered on the inside, and all oriented NNW-SSE. Inhumation was present throughout, sometimes multiple. There were no grave goods, but the date seems to fall within the 6th Ct AD (R. Panvini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 790). A small free- standing tomb building, probably vaulted, with a (sacked) tomb within, was also found; this is a type known elsewhere in Sicily belonging to the full Byz period, as in the better-preserv- ed example at Cittadella (SR) (P. Orsi, Sicilia bizantina I [Tivoli 1942] 34). SOUTHERN SICILY Provinces of Agrigento and Caltanissetta At Agrigento, the most exciting recent advance in our knowl- edge of the topography of ancient Akragas has been in the area behind the tourist bar due north of the 'Temple of Heracles', the scene of excavations by Griffo in the 1960s (Kokalos 9 [1963] 177). The Soprintendente at Agrigento, Dr G. Fiorentini, its new excavator, thinks that this is the site of a 'lower' agora, as Cicero (ii in Verr. 4.43.94) mentions that the forum is near the Temple of Hercules; but since the whereabouts of the latter is unknown (the deity honoured in the so-called 'Temple of Hercules' has not been identified), Cicero's evidence is of no help in locating the agora. The main, perhaps only, agora must lie near the ekklesiasterion and bouleuterion, probably under the present Museum car-park. Certainly the zone now under excavation is that of a vast public building with a portico at least 200m long flanking a street and provided with two long seats; on the other side, the portico opens onto a large open piazza. Not only is such a layout entirely appropriate to a gymnasium (cf. L. Moretti, Rivista di Filologia 104 [1976] 182), but two roof-tiles found in the new excavations stamped IYM[vaccnou strengthen the interpretation of this building as a' gymnasium. Much more has also been found of the well- known inscription carved on the back-rests of the long seats, of which part, discovered in the 1960s, is in the courtyard of the Agrigento Museum (Griffo, loc. cit.). Together with the part recovered 30 years ago, the seat inscription can now be seen as being in honour of Augustus while Lucius Egnatius, son of Lucius, of the Galeria voting tribe (?), wasflamen, and Sextus Rufus (?) son of Lucius and somebody else were duoviri. The Lucius son of Lucius, gymnasiarch, on the already known portion, may well have been father of either the famen or the duumvir. Sextus Rufus was already attested as a duumvir of Agrigento from a coin from the Agrigentine municipal mint (Wilson, Sicily, 43, fig. 32c), which must be after 2 BC as Augustus is named as pater patriae. Unless, therefore, Sextus Rufus held office more than once, the seat inscription must also date to between 2 BC and AD 14. The nomen Egnatius is later attested on tile-stamps in the plain of Gela (Wilson, Sicily, 216, fig. 176.19-20). The Agrigento text is important for a number of reasons: it documents unequivocally for the first time in Sicily that Greek was still used in the Augustan period for official inscriptions, even by towns which had gained municipal rank and so had duoviri; it documents the setting up at Agrigento of the municipal emperor cult, and gives us the name of its first known flamen (an office also known in the Augustan period at Halaesa, on numismatic evidence: Wilson, ibid. fig. 32b); and it provides the first certain documentation in Sicily of the survival into the Augustan period (and later) of the gymnasiarch as magistrate and of the gymnasium as an institution. We do not know how long into the Empire the Agrigento gymnasium remained in use, but it had certainly been abandoned by the early 4th Ct when a circular building of uncertain purpose, with three bases inside, was built over the gymnasium ruins (G. Fiorentini, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 12; ead., Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 725; ead., QuadMess 7 [1992 (publ. 1996)] 5). Excavations in the crucially important Pezzino necropolis on the W side of the town (AR 1987-88 126), the only major Agrigentine necropolis to be systematically explored under modern conditions, continued in 1988 and 1989: the total number of excavated graves now approaches 2,000. Work concentrated in the S sector, where first a group of 21 graves completely ransacked by clandestini was uncovered, and then more rewardingly another group of 24 burials, all inhumations ('a cassa' tombs) except for a single child cremation, inserted in a former quarry: they included monumental tombs from the late 6th to the mid-5th Ct BC, and, higher up, another layer of monumental tombs, belonging to the second half of the 5th Ct, and stopping with the Carthaginian sack of 406 BC. Eight of these 24 graves had already been sacked, but the rest produced grave goods, including a bf cup and bf lekythos, both Attic. One large grave was divided into two by a party wall (tombs 1927 and 1930), presumably members of the same family. The 1989 excavations concerned exclusively archaic burials, and very high-quality Attic bf cups are reported, but a detailed report is not to hand (G. Fiorentini, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [198889] 15). For a synthesis of some aspects of the earlier work in this necropolis, we have now E. De Miro, Agrigento: la necropoli greca di Pezzino (Messina 1989, pp. 97), which largely repeats the material already available in Veder Greco, the splendid catalogue of the 1988 exhibition (AR 1987-88 126); the material goes down rather later than its author realises, because tomb 1732, dated to the 3rd Ct BC, belongs rather to the second half of the 1st Ct BC (I owe this observation to the kindness of Dr John Hayes). The new volume is the first of a potentially very useful series, 'Necropoli della Sicilia antica', with another volume planned on Pezzino and others on the necropolises of Heraclea Minoa and Monte Adranone (both up to now completely unpublished). From the S. Gregorio necropolis S of the city the chance find in 1975 of a child's marble sarcophagus has now been fully published by F. Valbruzzi (RM 98 [1991] 299; cf. also in brief id., in G.

Further N, and just inside the line of the walls, the LR necropolis partially explored in recent years (AR 1987-88 127), and the subject of a number of interim reports (most recently in L. Pani Ermini, ed., Le sepolture in Sardegna dal IV secolo al VII secolo [IV Convegno sull'arche- ologia tardo-romana e medievale, Cagliari 1987], Oristano 1990, 391 and in BCASicilia ix-x.3 11988-89] 16) has recently been published in full by R.M. Bonacasa Carra, ed., Agrigento. La nectropoli paleocristicana sub divo [Istituto di Archeologia, Universita di Palermo, Studi e materiali 10] (L'Erma di Bretschneider, Rome 1995, pp. 429), a major landmark for Sicilian archaeology in its careful presentation of fully docu- mented small finds of this period. Meanwhile, such are the archaeological treasures of Agrigen- to that a flood of literature continues to appear on the famous monuments and sites. Foremost among these is the lavish publication edited by E. De Miro, La Valle dei Templi ad Agrigento (Sellerio: Palermo 1994), pp. 200, with an introduc- tion by G. Pugliese Carratelli and with essays by various hands. Then there is the delightful and handsome volume edited by the Soprintendente, Dr G. Fiorentini, La Valle dei templi: tra iconografia e storia (Assessorato Regionale/Soprint- endenza di Agrigento: Palermo and Agrigento 1994), primarily an album of 266 illustrations of Agrigento's monuments made by a wide variety of earlier travellers; the volume was pub- lished to mark the opening of a new antiquarium in the Valley of the Temples, the Antiquario Iconografico. To mark the presentation of a number of small exhibitions in 1990 in the Agrigento Museum and in the Villa Aurea, a splendid group of handsomely produced booklets, with all-colour illustrations, was published under the energetic editorship of Dr G. Fiorent- ini. One on prehistoric research is noted below; the others are Le necropoli greche di Agrigento dai recenti scavi (pp. 44); Gli edifici pubblici civili di Agrigento antica (pp. 52); and I Punici ad Agrigento: il quartiere di Porta II (pp. 44). The last in particular, about an area of late-5th to mid-3rd-Ct-BC housing (excavated in 1986-89) which is 'Punic' only in its use of opus Afiicanuni ('a telaio') style walling (and some imported Punic amphoras), presents some important cistern groups, more statuettes attesting Demeter worship (offerands holding a pig, female divinities with polos) and slabs of unbaked clay, apparently for pottery or terracotta production (cf. also BCA- Sicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 14, and, for a full catalogue, D. De Orsola, QuadMess 6 [1991] 71). An important volume of essays that the Veder G-reco exhibition spawned, L. Braccesi and E. De Miro (eds.), Agrigento e la Sicilia greca [Atti della settimana di studi 1988] (Rome 1992), pp. 234, concerns historical matters for about half the book (cf. also D. Asheri, Athenaelum 78 [1990] 483 for constitutional problems at Acragas between 471 and 446 BC), but archaeologists will welcome Dr Fiorentini's important comments on the topogra- phy of the acropolis and its surrounds, and on the terracotta industry (121), Professor Bonacasa's perceptive account of cultural links between Himera and Agrigento (133), Professor De Miro's study of the town plan and the major elements of Agrigentine topography (151), forays by G. Manganaro and A. Stazio on Agrigentine epigraphy (207) and numismatics (219), and Professor De Waele's summary of his already published views on the temples (157; cf. AR 1981-82 86, 96). On the temples, in fact, we have another exhaustive and scholarly exegesis fiom C. Hocker, Plantung und Konzeption der klassischen Ringhallentempel von Agrigent (Frankfurt et al. 1993), pp. 275, while P.R.J. Brouche has looked again at one of them, the mighty Olympieion, and claims that the enigmatic cuttings on the inner stylobate wall must have had a technical function, since they were below floor-level, and that the idiosyncratic exterior Doric column 'bases' were no such thing, but merely an indication that the building was unfinished and the columns never fluted at this point (AJA 99 [ 1995] 340). On matters numismatic, there is now L. Perdroni, Le contromarche di Aktragas (Naples: Liguori, 1995), pp. 191, a book I have not yet seen; and M. Caccamo Caltabiano's report on a R Republi- can coin hoard of 52 aurei, deposited near the bouleitterio,i during the troubled times of 214/3 BC, and found in 1987 (QluadMess 5 [1990] 49). On a less specialised note, we a-e once more indebted to Dr Fiorentini's fluent pen (in partnership with G. Pugliese Carratelli) for a splendidly illustrated guide to the Agrigenito.: lmuseo a-rcheologico (Palermo: Novecento, and Rome: Libreria dello Stato 1992, pp. 142), also available in a shorter and cheaper version which has an English as well as an Italian edition (pp. 63); but what a pity it is that, as elsewhere in Italy, neither such invaluable vade-mecum for the visitor is available for sale at the museum itself! Among fresh studies of long-known material, M.-G. Vanaria has carefully catalogued the two dozen Greek altars still visible at Agrigento, divided them into four types, and claimed eastern influence (via cities such as Naxos and Gela) for two of them (QuiadcMess 7 [1992] 11). M. Barbanera has devoted a whole monograph (whether the item of study quite deserved it is a moot point) to the well-known late A/early C warrior statue in marble from Agrigento, probably from a temple pediment showing a gigantomachy, considering possible reconstructions of the fragments, and setting them in their wider context; he suggests (on no very strong grounds) that a mainland Gr sculptor may have been responsible for it (Il guerriero di Agrigento, Rome, L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1995. pp. 128). L. Polacco interprets, again on slender evidence, the sanctuary S of the museum (with the 'Oratory of Phalaris' and po-zetti) as a tlesm7ophorion in honour of Demeter, and seems to favour Marconi's interpretation of the temple as a heroon (QuadMess 3 [1988] 59). E. De Miro (ibid. 63) sees the influence of Asia Minor on a number of features of Agrigen- tine topography, like the arrangement of the city in a series of terraces, the streets becoming staircases between the levels; the semicircular seating of the botuleuterion, which recalls that at Miletus, and, for size, that at Iasos; the 'Oratory of Phalaris' which he considers to be modelled on predecessors such as the 2nd Ct BC temple of Dionysus at Pergamon (whereas I see it as a hybrid Italo-Sicilian building under strong influence fiom the Italian peninsula: R.J.A. Wilson, in M. Henig, ed., Archi- tecture ad architectural sculpture in the Roma1n Empire [Oxford 1990] 75); and the 'Tomb of Theron' which he places in the mid-imperial period and compares with the tower-tombs of Roman N Africa (cf. Wilson, ibid. 83, who points out that the use of Sicilian Ionic capitals places it firmly in the late HL period rather than later). For the later period, the medieval pottery of Agrigento Museum has been published for the first time (G. Constantino, Federico II, 207), and a welcome first in Agrigentine medieval archaeology is the excavation in 1985 of two 1 Ith-Ct kilns in the area of the sub divo LR necropolis on the Temple Ridge (R.M. Bonacasa Carra, ibid. 217; Quattro inote, 81). In the territory of Agrigento the energetic excavations for the Soprintendenza by Dr G. Castellana and Dr G. Fiorentini have resulted in great strides forward in our knowledge of the Copper Age, MBA and LBA settlements in the area. The advances of the 1980s were presented in a small exhibition at</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Agrigento museum, of which the attractive booklet, G. Fioren- tini (ed.), Un decennio di ricerche preistoriclhe e p)rotostoriche nel territorio agrigentino (Agrigento 1990, pp. 66) is a permanent and useful record. Of particular significance is the village of Cannatello near the mouth of the river Naro, the site of excavations by Orsi, Rizzo and Musso in 1895 and 1905 (BPI 23 [1897] 106; Moniiumenti antichi XVIII [1907] 610), when a series of circular MBA huts and one rectangular one were reported. Now excavation by Professor E. De Miro and Dr G. Castellana has resumed since 1989, and in an area of 70 sq m have revealed two principal phases. In phase I the huts are all circular (within a substantial perimeter wall); hut 2, for example, is 8m in diameter, with entrance on the south, and is preserved two courses high (not counting foundations); the walls are clay-lined on the inside. To the second phase belong the rectangular buildings, of which at least three have been identified, together with a circular pebble-paved 'working area'. There is much local pottery, especially of Thapsos culture (mostly open forms), as well as bronze instruments, a mould for making a bronze axe, some fragments of obsidian, and a small quartz axe, presumably votive (G. Fiorentini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 718). But of exceptional interest is the quantity of LH IIIA2 and IIIB Mycenaean pottery imports here, nearly all of closed forms - amphoras with band motives, an amphora with octopus decoration, small amphoras painted with chevrons, wavy lines etc. It is now realised that the perfectly preserved amphoretta in Agrigento Museum (G. Pugliese Carratelli and G. Fiorentini, Agrigento: imuiseo archeologico [1992] 29, fig. 3) comes from this site. A great excitement is the presence also of Cypriot material: a hemi- spherical cup with vertical stripes, fragments of 13th Ct BC Cypriot pithoi (V. Karageorghis, CRAI 1993, 584, fig 3; E. De Miro, Atti del II Congresso internazionle di Miceenologia [Ncaples 1992], in press), and above all small amphora handles with Cipro-Minoan script; there is also meant to be a scrap of ox-hide ingot. This is the first time Myc pottery has been found in controlled excavation so far west in Sicily (apart from the single tiny fragment found at Milena, see below), and, while not altogether a surprise (in view of the known penetra- tion of Myc material almost the entire length of the Italian peninsula: T.R. Smith, M ycenaean trade and interaction in the west central Mediterranean 1600-1100 BC [Oxford 1987]), it is a welcome addition to our knowledge of Mycenaean and Cypriot imports into Sicily in the late Bronze Age. At the important excavations of Professor V. La Rosa (Catania) at contrada Sommita Serra del Parco at Milena, a single fragment of LH IIIA pottery was found in conjunction with two newly-uncovered stretches of wall associated with a Rodi-Vallelunga and Thapsos ficies rubbish deposit. The LH fragment (a body sherd painted with overlapping scale pattern) provides another tiny piece of evidence to add to the growing body of Mycenaean material in Sicily; and in view of the proximity of tholos tombs at S. Angelo Muxaro to this site, discussion has inevitably been once again reopened on that hoary chestnut - whether or not the Sicilian rock-cut tholos tombs are influenced by their Mycenaean counterparts (V. La Rosa, QuadMess 3 [1988] 5). The 1992 campaign produced fragmentary walls meeting at right-angles to form a rectangular building of some sort, in larger masonry than earlier walls at the site, and datable to the LBA; this has given rise to the hypothesis that they might be the remains of an 'anaktoron', like that at Pantalica mentioned above; but a trifle more of the structure is still needed to make a convincing case (id., QiadMess 6 [1991, publ. 1994] 5). There is much else of importance for the place of the Milena excavations in the context of Sicilian prehistory in Tusa, Belice 357-64, and on the N and Copper Age pottery (C. Guzzone and L. Maniscalco, ibid. 305 and 323). Two very simple plain gold earrings found by chance in 1991 on the slopes of Monte Campanella nearby (also in the comitne of Milena) have been claimed as belonging to the BA and more specifically to between the late Thapsos and early Pantalica periods; what is more, they are assumed to be of Aegean manufacture in view of the apparent absence of gold-smithing at that time in Sicily (P. Militello, QuadMess 6 [1991] 17). Other recent work on the prehistory of this district includes an analysis of human remains from contrada Menta, and a report on the 1985 excavations in an EBA settllement at Mezzebi, both in the territory of Milena (F. Malegni et al., in Tusa, Belice 373; F. Privitera, ibid. 339). There is also a report on excavations in the 1960s and in 1986 in the 'Antro Fazello' part of the 'Stufe di S. Calogero' complex at the imposing site of Monte Kronio near Sciacca, where a well-preserved stratigraphy documented human activity from the late Pleisto- cene through to the late Copper Age, with a little A and HL material on top (S. Tine et al. in Tusa, Belice 245). Among other sites in the Agrigentino investigated in recent years by Dr Castellana, whose work is revolutionising our knowledge of the region's prehistory, we may note in the neighbourhood of Palma di Montechiaro (25km E of Agrigen- to) Piano Vento, where 28 Copper Age tombs were excavated in 1989-92. Most were trench graves ('a fossa'), but some consisted of chamber tombs with dromoiii; 80% of the burials were multiple inhumations, 71 individuals in all having been identified. Pottery was of local Piano Vento style, contempor- ary with that of S. Cono-Piano Notaro culture. Near the tombs was found alleged evidence for commemorative ritual sacrifices and votive terracotta deposits; one of the figurines is apparently anthropoid, nude, ithyphallic, but with a bull's face (G. Castellana, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 735; id., SicArch xxvi.83 [1993] 73; id., La necropoli protoeneolitica di Picano Vento nel territoriio di Palina di Montechiaro, Agrigento 1995; G. Fornaciari and S. Cecchi Parenti, Atti III Valle Himera 63, for skeletal material). Perhaps inevitably links with the Aegean and Anatolia have been claimed, sometimes, one feels, at the risk of ignoring the likelihood of home-grown individuality and creativity. At Monte Grande, also near Palma di Montechiaro, where excavations in the BA sanctuary site (localita Baffo), apparently dedicated to a cult of fertility and procreation, have been proceeding annually since 1987 (G. Castellana, QuadMess 5 [1990] 5; BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 48), work has concen- trated on the acropolis (Pizzo Italiano) with its massive Castelluccian defensive wall (3m wide, up to 3.70m wide in places), within which four sub-circular Copper Age huts have been identified. These were overlain by an EBA semicircular precinct wall not associated with structures within, but contem- porary with a mass of Castelluccian pottery as well as a clay model of a circular hut (id., Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 741). The most exciting development is, however, the discovery of many fragments (over a hundred now) of 14th Ct BC Mycena- ean pottery associated with this Castelluccian material, including polychrome, banded, orange and plain wares as well as Aegina gold-mica ware: all this documents with especial clarity Mycenaean contact with Sicily at an early date, before the main burst of activity in the 13th/12th Ct Even older are the few fiagments of LH IIB/IIIAI pottery (end of 15th Ct/beginning of the 14th Ct BC) which have come from a site further E, Madre Chiesa di Gaffe near Licata (BCASicilia ix-x [1988-89] 50; Atti III Valle Himera 53). The LH IIB fragment was found in a Castelluccian level, and two fragments of LH IIIA were found in a hut belonging to the Thapsos culture. Dr 89</page><page sequence="32">90 R. J. A. WILSON Castellana has provided a preliminary account of all this important Aegean material (in Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 48), and it was the subject of an exhibition at Agrigento in 1993, of which the catalogue is Contatti e scambi egei nel territorio agrigentini nel III e II millennio a. C. I micenei ad Agrigentino, Agrigento 1993 (cf. also E. De Miro on the same theme in QuadMess 7 [1992, publ. 1996] 25); more extended treatment is also promised (G. Castellana in Atti Convegno Internazionale sulle culture marinare nel Basso Tirreno nei secc. XVI e XV a.C. [Napoli-Procida-Ischia], in press). A selection of material from here is in the new Museo della Badia at Licata, a splendid addition to Sicily's already rich collection of fine archaeological museums (cf. P. Meli, Archeologia Viva xiv.53 [September/October 1995] 58 for this museum and a useful round-up of Licatan archaeology; and for chance underwater finds off its coast, including lead anchor stocks, stamped ARS and an African spatheion amphora, see A. Freschi, Atti III Valle Himera 111). About 15km NE of Licata lies the imposing site of La Muculufa (AR 1987-88 129), where the important excavations of Professors R. Ross Holloway (Brown University) and B.E. McConnell (Tufts University) continued until 1991. Of the Castelluccian village of towards the end of EBA (C14 dates indicate a floruit of c. 2200 BC), four huts have been exca- vated, estimated to comprise just 1% of the surface area of the settlement; some indication of the remaining 99% has been provided by geophysical survey carried out in 1990. One oval hut measures 6m in diameter and was provided with a gravel floor, which extended outside under the eaves and beyond to provide a dry walkway around the hut. An outdoor kitchen with millstone and pit in situ were also identified; grindstones are of Etna basalt brought from over 100km away. Wheat, olives, quince, grape and mustard have been identified among the seeds. Of the animal bones, 85% represent sheep/goats, but pigs and cattle were also present. Adjacent to the village, at the summit of the crest (which is strikingly visible for at least 30km around), a sanctuary area was identified, where meat was cooked on trodden hearths and consumed, the vessels used in consumption being left as votives to the gods. The pottery from this site is of superb quality, of black designs painted on a red ground: 20,000 decorated sherds were recovered in all, 75% of them from the sanctuary. Some are open bowls on stands, others are braziers, others were used for mixing. Close similarities between the La Muculufa pottery and that from the site at Canticaglione, 10km to the SE, suggest that they probably derive from same potter's workshop. In the sanctuary most of animals were killed at less than one year old; the reverse was the case in the village. A cemetery of over 200 chamber tombs is also known. The hill-top was not occupied after the BA (apart from a small rectangular building of the 4th Ct BC, with some older material, including LC, which has been identified close by), until signs of activity in the 11th Ct. (Count Roger took the rock in 1086, if Mocluse is to be identified with Muculufa) which lasted into the 12th Ct (R.R. Holloway, M.S. Joukowsky and S.S. Lukesh, Archaeology, Jan.-Feb. 1988, 40; Revue des archeologues et historiens d'art de Louvain 23 [1990] 11-67; B.E. McConnell, AJA 96 [1992] 23 (for the huts, with useful comparanda from elsewhere in Sicily); id., Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 771-82, which includes a very full bibliography on La Muculufa to date; for medieval occupation, id., Federico II, 229). Nor has the prehistory of the area to the W of Agrigento been ignored. At Scirinda, near Ribera, excavations since 1991 have found a series of superimposed phases. These include LBA Thapsos culture, with large circular huts and a paved road 1.90m wide and 28m long: associated with this phase is a single fragment of LH III/A pottery, which, if correctly identified, provides further evidence of Aegean contact with Sicily in the LBA. Superimposed on this was a Pantalica Nord phase, with final occupation in Ausonian II (10th-9th Ct BC), to which rectangular structures and a circular precinct wall belong. Twenty giant pithoi were found in one deposit inside one of these rectangular buildings. A C14 date from here confirms the traditional chronology for S. Angelo Muxaro-Poli- zzello culture of the 8th-6th Cts BC (S. Tusa, in R. Skeates and R. Whitehouse, eds., Radiocarbon dating and Italian prehistorn [Accordia Research Centre: specialist studies on Italy 3], London 1994, 108). Also near Ribera, to the W of the town, a necropolis of 84 tombs, either 'a pozzetto' or chamber tombs, were discovered in contrada Castello and cleaned in 1987; sacking by the clandestini had been thorough, but fragments of S. Cono/Piano Notaro pottery confirmed a Copper Age date; and a contemporary burial, with four items of grave goods still intact, was rescued the same year from the jaws of the bulldozer at Cozzo Mastrogiovanni in the NE outskirts of Ribera (B.E. McConnell, SicArch xxi.66-68 [1988] 101). Further W, and considerably later in date, is the hut settlement at Montagnoli 6km E of Selinus, with indigenous ('Sican'?) pottery and perhaps votive material from an alleged chthonic cult belonging to the 8th Ct; the site was destroyed by fire in the mid-7th Ct BC, it is suggested by the hand of arriving Greek colonists at Selinus (G. Castellana, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 751). Of the many anonymous hill-sites of the interior of central southern Sicily, most activity has been concentrated in recent years at Polizzello, a lofty but well-watered site (827m high) in the middle valley of the Platani near Musomeli, where Orsi dug towards the end of his long life (D. Palermo, CronASA 20 [1981] 103). The energetic excavations of Professor E De Miro for the Agrigento Soprintendenza (cf. also AR 1987-88 130) have now shown that the oldest settlement at Polizzello (fragments of huts) dates to the LBA Pantalica culture, but most interest centres on the later habitation of 8th - 6th Ct date, one of the first of this period in Sican territory to be extensively explored (E. De Miro, QuadMess 3 [1988] 25; BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 29). On the acropolis, what is interpreted as a circular sacral building has been uncovered ('Edificio D' on Fig. 18, 8m in diameter, with curved bench along the N wall); it has a central circular altar within (unusually) and votive depositions of 8th-6th Ct BC pottery. Immediately E and S are two small rectangular structures, one of them (that to the E, the larger: 'Edificio C') with central altar and a bench along the back wall. Votives include a two- pronged bronze object of uncertain significance, an indigenous bronze figure of an offerand with a bowl, and two painted clay models of circular shrines, reflecting the form of the circular one actually uncovered. There are also burnt bones (including deer antlers), a fragmentary bronze knife, a bone knife handle, an amber necklace, and a silver brooch, as well as bone pieces of uncertain function with impressed circle decoration on them. There is little Gr pottery mixed in with these deposits, but what there is (a PC skyphos of c. 640 from one deposit, some Ionic A2 cups from another) helps to date to the 7th and 6th Ct BC deposits that are overwhelmingly indigenous (and presumably, in view of the geographical location, Sican) in character. Whether any of these remarkable finds show undercurrents of contact with the LBA and IA Greek world, as has been claimed (E. De Miro, in La transizione dal Miceneo all'alto arcaismo. Dal palazzo alla citti. Atti del convegno internazionale, Roma, 14-19 marzo 1988 [Rome 1991] 603), is more doubtful.

There is plentiful incised local pottery, bearing some affinity to the incised pottery of western Sicily, as well as painted wares; Gr imports arrive comparatively late. To the SW of the acropolis a short stretch of the defences (Fig. 18, top left), with a gate in the form of a simple opening subsequently closed (off the plan), has also been uncovered. But the richest haul of pottery has come from the E necrop- olis, where tombs are generally squarish chambers cut in the rock, their entrance closed by a stone slab or walling. One tomb in particular produced an enormous array of complete pots from the 7th Ct BC onwards, mostly with geometric painted decoration, but with some incised wares as well; one of the latter has the eyes and nose of a human face incorpor- ated into the design (pace De Miro, ibid. 611, surely not a Cretan bull). The native wares are joined by a few Gr imports only at the end of the 7th Ct, with a little Corinthian and Ionic B cups. One tomb (no. 25) also contained a group of eight 7th-Ct Egyptianizing scarabs, also presumably brought to Sicily 91 910 1 11 tI--_ _ __ G H I - I : I i Fig. 18  zo ..... ;,_t4l ws .---- _ J -"'.... n - - - - - -  I I _ _ _  5 -- - -·r- ·-  i I I E</page><page sequence="34">92 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 20 Fig. 19 via Greek channels: they were found in association with an Ionic B1 cup and imitation Corinthian and possibly imitation Cypriot pottery. Unusual was the use of a large cylindrical container with incised decoration for an enchvtrismos burial; the rest of the enchytrismos burials, which at Polizzello usually contain the remains of children and are found outside the chamber tombs, are in amphoras as customary. Another curious feature in the necropolis was a series of circular bases of uncertain purpose outside three tombs, interpreted as altars or 'funerary tables' connected with funerary ritual. Polizzello, therefore, has lived up to its early promise of yielding 'some of the most remarkable examples of native art in Sicily' (Dunbabin, WG 141), and will henceforth be a major site for our understanding of the peoples Thucydides (6.2.5) calls the Sicans and of their cultural distinctiveness from the Sikels (despite the doubts of Dunbabin, WG 40 that there was any); and we cannot but be grateful to Professor De Miro for at last providing some considerable archaeological flesh to put on the previously bare bones of Sican identity. Work has also resumed on the indigenous late-A and C hill-top settlement on Monte Raffe, 6km S of Polizzello in the territory of Mussomeli, which was briefly explored by Griffo in the 1950s (FA 12 [1957] 2853): here Dr S. Lagona of Catania University has conducted several campaigns since 1983. On the S slopes of the acropolis she has uncovered a 5-roomed structure and other walls belonging to houses; two were provided with cisterns, one containing 5th- 3rd Ct BC material. Finds from the houses included plenty of indigenous A wares (some of 'Polizzello' type), with Gr imports joining them from the later 6th Ct; there were also several statuettes of Demeter, some of them larger than customary. Four houses have also been uncovered in another sector of the settlement, on the central terrace of the hill, with rather later occupation (mid-5th/late 4th Ct BC). Also identified on a small spur was an indigenous rock-cut sanctuary with a small shrine; this was fronted by an open space provided with a rock-cut bench. The sacral character of the site is indicated by the great quantities of fragmentary votive female statuettes and lamps, all of 5th/4th Ct date. Like so many of these hill-tops of the interior, Monte Raffe seems to have been abandoned in the 3rd Ct BC, and then reoccupied in medieval times, especially from the 12th-14th Cts (to which belong medieval fortifications on the summit of the hill); chance finds include two gold coins from the Palermo mint of the end of the 11th Ct (S. Lagona, SicGymn 45 [1992] 106). Some 50km to the W of Polizzello lies the stunning site of Monte Adranone, first explored between 1968 and 1972 and then again in the mid-1980s (AR 1981-82 103; 34 [1987-88] 131). Further campaigns of excavation in 1988 and 1989 by Dr G. Fiorentini for the Agrigento Soprintendenza once again investigated both settlement and cemetery. In the W necropolis 25 inhumation graves, mostly 'a cassa' (there was only one 'a cappuccina'), have been excavated as well as a distinct sector, defined by a separate precinct wall, reserved for cremations (three areas of ustrina). The date of the necropolis ranges from the mid-5th to the late 4th Ct BC; high-quality Attic rf, a bronze dish with a swan's-head handle, a bronze strigil and a bronze olpe are among the grave goods. In the settlement, a two-roomed building was uncovered in the hollow to the S of the N gate; one of the rooms had two basins, one for the working of clay, and contained numerous clay (water?)-pipes. The building, which seems to have been a depot and workshop for pottery production, was built in the 4th Ct BC and dramati- cally destroyed in the mid-3rd Ct, presumably during the First Punic War, as shown by numerous traces of fire and by the many lead sling-shot missiles found in the building (G. Fiorentini, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 18). For an excellent introduction to the site and its archaeology, there is now a guidebook to the site in the state's Ministero per i Beni culturali e ambientali series: G. Fiorentini, Monte Adranone [Itinerari XVI] (Rome: Istituto Poligrafico dello Stato, 1995), pp. 82. Caltabellotta, another dramatically situated hill-town 15km SE of Monte Adranone, and 20km NE of Sciacca, perhaps to be identified with the ancient Triocala, has been finally put on</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 93 the archaeological map with the researches since 1982 of Dr R. Panvini in contrada S. Benedetto, on the outskirts of the modern town (AR /987-88 131). Her excavations have shown that a hut village belonging to the S. Angelo Muxaro culture was succeeded in the mid-6th Ct by a Gr-influenced habitation, consisting of one- or two-roomed houses scattered somewhat haphazardly across the terrain without any sign of a regular town layout: in this the settlement is similar to that at Monte S. Mauro di Caltagirone. Material included a bronze oenochoe of Rhodian type, a bf alabastron and other bg, all of the 6th Ct BC. One rectangular structure of c. 550/500 BC, which yielded a clay louterion and a terracotta statuette of a seated goddess, was interpreted as a shrine. The site was fortified at some stage with defensive walls of 'agger' type (a fill between two curtain walls), and interval towers, except where the natural rock rendered a curtain wall unnecessary. The defences appear to belong to the 6th Ct, and to have remained repaired down into the 4th The houses were periodically altered during the 5th and 4th Ct, but no fundamental changes in the character of the settlement took place. It was abandoned, like so many hill- towns, from the mid-3rd Ct BC onwards until re-occupation in Byzantine times (R. Panvini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 759; cf. also eadc. QltadMess 2 [1986-871 109: Montevago e Enitella, 163). Work has also been proceeding at another hitherto unex- plored hill-top dominating the Platani valley, that in contrada La Montagnola near S. Giovanni Gemini, where surface pottery indicates occupation from the 9th to the 4th Ct BC; the site, like most of the 'anonymous' hill-top centres of the interior, is also defended. Controlled excavation on a site looted by clandestini for years revealed two rooms of a building of c. 550 BC ('Ionic' B2 cups, LC pottery) with an indigenous layer (S. Angelo Muxaro culture) below; part of a hut of this indigenous phase was found SE of the 'Greek' building (R. Panvini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 758). At Heraclea Minoa, in the area of the Gr necropolis in contrada Piana Vizzi, the first systematic excavation (in 1991) of the long-suspected prehistoric settlement has produced plentiful late Copper Age/EBA material in a series of four parallel trenches belonging to a village settlement (D. Gulli, QuadMess 8 [1993, publ. 1996] 11). The archaic necropolis was itself the scene of further excavation in 1989, when 137 tombs from the earliest days of the city (c. 550-500 BC) were uncovered (and a portion left exposed: Fig. 19), of which 83 were enchytrismoi, often bunched together in groups, 38 were inhumations in tile-lined graves, stone sarcophagi or 'a cappuccina' burials, and only 15 were cremations (4 ustrina, 11 with cremated remains contained within pots). Tomb 83 yielded a LC column krater (or rather krateriskos) with the triple handles attached to plastic female heads; the body of the vase has geometric rather than figured decoration. Amphoras used for burial included Corinthian A and 'Ionic' types. For the first time some idea of social differentiation within the necropolis was gained, with the discovery of a cemetery road, to the N of which were largely enchytrismoi, while to the S were eight burials of which six were in stone sarcophagi (G. Fiorentini, BCASicilia ix-x [1988-89] 17). Within the Greek city itself work is currently focusing on a peristyle house on the S side of the excavated area, with four columns on unusual conical bases set around the central light-well. Numerous Dressel 1 amphoras lie in the destruction/abandonment levels here. Just outside the walls to the NE, on a site hitherto known from surface evidence to date from c. AD 425 to c. 600 (R.J.A. Wilson and A. Leonard Jr., Journal of Field Archaeology 7 [1980] 231-5), a twin-aisled basilican church 17.50m wide and 22m long, with apse to E (far right in Fig. 20), and attendant Fig. 21 sub divo necropolis, have been uncovered, with some scanty remains of an associated settlement to the N. The church, which is comparatively poor (its floors are of beaten earth), lies immediately above a portion of the A Greek necropolis; one late 6th Ct BC tomb, for example, its grave goods still intact, was found walled up into the basilica's S aisle. Six LR tombs within the church are believed to predate the construction of the building; these, and the church itself, uses tiles of combed type, which I originally suggested came into use around the first quarter of the 5th Ct AD (R.J.A. Wilson, in A. McWhirr, ed., Ronman brick and tile [Oxford 1979] 23), but which I now believe, on the evidence of my own excavations at Campanaio (see below), where they are rare, to be not earlier than the late 5th Ct. The church itself is probably, therefore, not before c. AD 475 at the earliest. Further chronological details may emerge from closer study of the grave goods, but 15 out of the excavated 23 graves have none (perhaps a reflection of Christian beliefs rather than of absolute poverty), and there is little closely datable material (plain wares, bronze bracelets, bronze and silver earrings, necklaces in paistac vitrea). A chance find near one of the tombs of a fragmentary marble portrait (?) head, rather earlier in date (3rd/4th Ct AD), presumably reflects earlier activity here or nearby. This rural basilica is a welcome and significant addition to the comparatively small number of late 5th/early-6th-Ct paleochristian churches in the island (G. Fiorentini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 729). Approximately 5km E of Heraclea Minoa, two rural sites in the hinterland of the Gr city have been under investigation since 1993. One is Castagna, where a substantial R building was first explored by the writer in the 1980s (AR 1987-88 133), and where excavations resumed in 1993 on behalf of the Agrigento Soprintendenza and the University of Dublin at Trinity College (to which he then belonged). The area E of that already excavated was found to have been badly disturbed by the plough, but nevertheless evidence for five main phases between the late 2nd Ct BC and the late 4th Ct AD was discovered there, including part of a boundary wall and gate pier begun but then aborted before AD 100. Further W a second area uncovered the W end of the building found in the 1980s, together with three further rooms (Fig. 21), so that this large and unpretentious farmhouse with earth floors is now known in its final phase of c. AD 100 to have measured 28m by at least 15m and to have contained 10 rooms; it was abandoned after its roof collapsed c. AD 175/200. The super- structure was of mud-brick on dry-stone foundations, but the</page><page sequence="36">94 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 24 Fig. 22 Fig. 23 surface discovery of a fragment of burnt daub shows that some part of the superstructure of this or an adjacent building must have been of wattle-and-daub. Part of a first-phase building erected c. AD 50 and demolished in the alterations of c. AD 100 was also found. The associated levels of AD 50/100 were particularly rich in finds, which included plentiful Italian sigillata (stamps of L. Ras(inius) Pis(anus), C. Sent(ius), (P.) Corn(elius), Cn. At(eius), Cn. At(eius) M(ahes?) and C.P.P.), many with applique designs; six pieces of lead-glazed pottery, with green glaze on the exterior and yellow on the inside, or vice versa, which were imported from Tarsus in E Turkey, the first of their type to be recognised in Sicily (one is shown in Fig. 22; height of fragment: 5.3cm); the earliest forms of ARS, including an example of a beaker of Hayes form 155, hitherto known from only a single specimen, in Copenhagen; a brick stamp of Fortunatus, slave of Vinicius, common in the Pozzuoli region, but elsewhere in Sicily attested only in Lipari (Kokalos 32 [1986] 254); a fragment of glass belonging to a mouldblown beaker of a type with a principally E Mediterranean distribu- tion (only four other examples of it were previously known from the W); and various bone items, including a spoon, hair-pins and a statuette of Venus (probably also part of a hairpin; Fig. 23). The last is a crude affair, originally in the Venus Medici pose (as shown by the knob between the breasts, to support the arm), and possibly a reject piece in view of the doubly-incised pubic area. Finds from elsewhere on the site include two HL Rhodian wine amphora handles, one with the Rhodian name of a month legible (Dalios), the other recording the magistrate Hippokrates. Long after the collapse of the roof a circular pit was dug in the ruins in the 5th Ct AD: it con- tained fragments of African amphoras (Keay form LXII), ARS pottery and lamps, and numerous animal bones, including a minimum of 99 individual frogs. Rather than jump to the tempting conclusion that frogs were among the delicacies consumed by the LR inhabitants of Castagna, it seems better to prefer the more mundane explanation that the frogs had jumped into the pit before it was sealed in the early 6th Ct, perhaps because it attracted water after rain, and then found themselves unable to get out (R.J.A. Wilson, QuadMess 8 [1993, pub. 1996] 29; id., in id., ed., From River Trent to Raqqa: Nottingham University archaeological fieldwork in Britain, Europe and the Middle East, 1991-95 [Nottingham Studies in Archaeology 1] (Nottingham 1996] 24). Castagna is probably the site of a farmstead with some ancillary outbuildings. Onekm to the S lies the larger site of Campanaio, almost certainly an agricultural village spread out over 3 ha on a gently sloping hillside. Excavation was con- ducted here by the writer on behalf of the University of Dublin in 1994, and continued in 1995 for the University of Notting- ham, both under the aegis of the Agrigento Soprintendenza. On the W side of the site an extensive tile fall was uncovered, sealing a great quantity of 5th-Ct-AD smashed amphoras below</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 25 Fig. 26 it: other pottery mixed up with this deposit included kitchen ware (Fig. 24 shows a lid of a Pantelleria cooking casserole in sitU). There is a minimum of 16 amphoras (Sicilian, African and eastern), which had been propped up against the wall of a building so far only partially uncovered: five of the spikes bear letters incised before firing (P, B, I, U and K). presumably control marks. Two of the amphoras have been restored entire: one (Fig. 25) is cylindrical, 1.19m high, in an orange fabric with lime inclusions, possibly of Sicilian manufacture (its spike bears the letter P): the other is a LR amphora type 1, which brought oil fi-om Cilicia in E Turkey (Fig. 26), elsewhere attested in Sicily on dry land only at Syracuse, Marsala and now Punta Castelluzzo near Augusta (see above, under Syracuse province). Since Campanaio is already known itself to have been producing oil (R.J.A. Wilson, SicArch xv.48 [1982] 7). it is intriguing to find this oil calrrier present: was Campanaio a market centre for the sale of oil of different provenances and qualities, or were empty containers being filled with the local oil, possibly even to be sold off to unsuspecting buyers as imported produce? Excavation 10m further E has uncovered a substantial building 6.60mi wide and at least 22m long, of which 9 rooms have been so far identified (Fig. 27); the presence of a stairwell indicates that at least part of it had a second storey. This dates to the second half of the I st Ct BC, but five phases have been identified in all here, starting in the 2nd Ct BC and ending in the 5th Ct AD. when one room was put back into use. possibly as a smithy (on the evidence of iron slag within the roomi and iron-working debris in a pit immediately outside). This phase was brought to an end by fire: the pottery in the destruction layer included an Afi-icaln slitheioin, Pantellerian cooking pots and an ARS plate (Hayes 61B) with stamped decoration. Curiously, both the latter (Fig. 28) and one of the casseroles had had holes drilled in the middle of their bases for a piupose as yet unclear. Nearly 40m further E again, part of an LR building was uncovered in 1995, including one room 3.75mn x 3.50 m.. with entrance threshold to the E. The mud-brick walls of this room were still partially in situ on their stone foundations, a feature which demonstrates tor the first time that this time-honoured building technique, first attested for the early Empire at Castagna, also continued in use in the area in LR times. This structure also peiished in a violent fire: the destruction layer contained more amphoras, including another Afirican spatlheioin and another Cilician LR I, cooking wares, jugs in a locally-produced white ware, and stamped ARS: also here were two ARS lamps (Fig. 29), one with recumbent lion on the discus, the other with a bejewelled cross and, on the rim, impressions of a gold coin of Theodosius II minted in AD 430. The lire must theretore have occurred after that year; and in view of the fact that three separate mid-5th Ct destruction deposits have now been identified at Campanaio, one wonders whether the destruction was not accidental but the 95</page><page sequence="38">96 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 28 Fig. 27 work of Vandals, who are known to have harried the S and W coasts of Sicily continuously between AD 440 and 475. NW of here a tile-kiln located by geophysical survey (conducted by John Gale, University of Bournemouth) was partially excavated. Measuring 4.75m x 4.25m and of uncertain date within the R period, it is built of mortared rubble walls (unlike the rest of the structures at Campanaio, which are dry-stone) lined with clay. The top of the brick arch of the firing opening, 1.20m wide, was also located, as well as parts of the floor of the kiln which had collapsed into the firing chamber beneath; the latter, clearly still intact, awaits further excavation. A test trench exposed the S wall of the kiln to a depth of 0.85m. This is only the third place where a tile kiln of R imperial date in Sicily has been located (the others are at Partinico and Naxos, and the latter was primarily used for firing amphoras: see above). At least two other kiln sites at Campanaio and a pottery dump are indicated by surface finds and geophysical survey on this N side of the site, and await investigation in a future season of work (R.J.A. Wilson, in id., ed., Fro11m River Trent to Raqqa [see Castagna above] 29). Campanaio and Castagna are examples of HL- and R-period sites in the immediate hinterland of a Gr city (in this case Heraclea Minoa) which continue to thrive long after the city itself has been abandoned. Similar dispersal of settlement to the countryside as a result of the plax Romana is attested further W, where the site of Sant'Anna (contrada Montevergine), immediately S of Caltabellotta, is an example of a rural site with a floruit long after the hill-top settlement itself at Caltabe- llotta (see above) had been abandoned. At Sant'Anna excava- tions have revealed a rural building of uncertain size with dry-stone walls, earth floors, and kitchen with hearth, dated to the 4th/5th Ct AD and violently destroyed in the mid-5th Ct, perhaps by Vandals. Sant'Anna therefore shares with Campanaio (see above) both a similar building technique (presumably with mud-brick superstructure on top of the dry-stone walls) and a similar destruction date. Another set of rooms, on a different orientation and with combed 'Byzantine' roof-tiles, then replaced the LR building in the later 5th Ct AD.; this later building produced stamped ARS, lamps and coins of Constans and Justinian. By the late 6th Ct, however, the site had become deserted (R. Panvini, Kokilos 39-40 [1993-941 762 eadl., Montevago e Entella, 165). Thereafter the main centres of population, for reasons of defence, tended to shift back to the hill-tops, some of them previously occupied in A-HL times, others freshly settled. A group of such sites in the Platani valley have been considered in their medieval context on the basis of surface sherding by M.S. Rizzo (SicArch xxiii.73 [19901 41). Definitely more up-market than Castagna, Campanaio or Sant'Anna is the R villa site of Durrueli di Realmonte, on the coast SW of Agrigento, where Professor M. Aoyagi (University of Tokyo) has been excavating since 1980 (AR 1987-88 132). Apart from an interim report after the first excavation season, however (Kokalos 26-27 [1980-811 668), this work regrettably remains completely unpublished (cf. in brief Wilson, Sicily, 198); but we do now have a publication of a much damaged black and white mosaic 6m square from the villa (Fig. 30), depicting Neptune with trident standing on a dolphin, with an outer border of 'city wall' type; its NW corner was damaged and repaired in antiquity. Professor Aoyagi thinks on the basis of specific stylistic Italian comparanda (not always in my view relevant to Sicily) that the mosaic can be dated between AD 81 and 130 (QuadMess 3 [19881 91); a 2nd-Ct date in general seems likely. The poor quality of the laying out of the design and of the figure drawing makes a Sicilian mosaicist a strong possibility, but one very much aware of the contemporary Italian iconographical repertoire and the black and white style then current in the peninsula. In advance of threatened road- -widening, excavation has taken place for the first time on the</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 29 N side of the modern coastal road, and found two rooms, one with a hypocaust, belonging to a further structure in the villa estate. These is the first building to be identified outside the main residential villa itself, and raises the question as to whether or not this site was the centre of a farming estate with outbuildings to the N of the residential de luxe establishment, or whether, as has hitherto seemed likely, it was merely the villa maritima of some wealthy Agrigentine. To the E of Agrigento, more is known now of the R site in contrada Cignana near Naro. Agricultural damage here had already been severe, and included the destruction of a figured polychrome mosaic featuring animals. Emergency excavations followed, from 1992, and have revealed a small bath-suite with a single hypocausted room as well as black and white mosaics, one with a marine scene. This bath-house is thought to date to the 2nd or early 3rd Ct AD, and belongs to a peristyle villa of which little else is known. Two later phases, of uncertain character, the last of the 5th/6th Ct, are also known. The site is very fertile and rich in springs; water mills functioned here until the present century (G. Fiorentini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993- -94] 728). Another R site E of Agrigento is that at Saraceno near Favara (AR 1987-88 133), where further excavation took place in 1992. An astonishing continuity of occupation has now been demonstrated in one part of the site from the Byz era, into an Arab phase and then into the Norman period, with life finally petering out here in the 12th Ct The explanation, therefore, for the contrada's name, Saraceno, has now been archaeologically demonstrated (G. Castellana, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 752). A detailed interim report on this site has been Fig. 30 97 .5 1 2M</page><page sequence="40">98 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 31 published (G. Castellana and B. McConnell, AJA 94 [1990] 25), as has a listing of 200 sherds of fairly run-of-the-mill ARS pottery found during the excavations (G. Castellana, SicArch xxv.78-79 [1992] 45). For an agricultural establishment of rather earlier date, it is good to report that in contrada Grancif- one Dr Castellana excavated in 1987 a C-period farm, the first example of its kind in the Agrigentino: a 5th-Ct BC building was succeeded by a second farm in the 4th Ct, with rooms ranged around a central court. Of the three rooms on its north side, one had an oil press, the second a wine press, and the third was apparently a store for agricultural produce (G. Castellana, BTCGI VIII [1990] 169). We may also note here the fieldwork of Dr V. Giustolisi in the area of Comitini and Aragona, where he has identified a number of new sites from prehistoric to R, and thinks that he can locate in contrada Capo, SE of Aragona, the road station of Pitiniana, recorded by It.Ant. (96.6) on the Agrigento-Palermo R road (V. Giustol- isi, La Petra di Calathansuderj e la "statio Pitiniana" [Sicilia archeologica che scompare 8] (Palermo: Centro di documentaz- ione e ricerca per la Sicilia antica "Paolo Orsi", 1988), pp. 148. The mother city of Agrigento, Gela, has again been the scene of more or less continuous excavation, first by Dr Fiorentini when Gela came under Agrigento's archaeological jurisdiction, and then, since the creation of the Caltanissetta Soprintendenza, by Dr Rosalba Panvini. The Gela museum, refurbished as recently as 1988 (cf. G. Fiorentini, Gela: la citta antica e il suo territorio. II museo [Palermo 1985], pp. 62), is now (1996) closed again for further major reorganisation. Meanwhile, however, a new permanent Antiquarium has opened at the archaeological park of Capo Soprano, with its superbly preserved HL defences. The most sensational dis- covery at Gela of the past few years has undoubtedly been that of an archaic wreck in its waters, found 500m offshore in 1988 at a depth of 5 m, and dating to the very beginning of the 5th Ct BC (G. Fiorentini, QuadMess 5 [1990] 25, with detailed catalogue of selected items and copious illustrations, is the most substantial publication; cf. also R. Panvini and A. Freschi, in IV Rassegna subacquea, 197; Parker, Shipwrecks no. 441; R. Panvini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 786; ead., Archeologia Viva xii.37 [Aprile 1993] 58). Not surprisingly, in view of the paucity of wrecks of this date which have hitherto been adequately explored, the discovery has aroused considerable interest. Publication of the proceedings of an international Convegno held at the Gela museum in 1990, La nave arcaica di Gela, is said to be imminent, and another volume, sponsored by AGIP, is in preparation. The ship, which was about 20m long and heavily weighted with stone, marble, granite and sand ballast, had a principal cargo of Chiot wine amphoras on board, and lesser numbers from Lesbos and Samos, with some Punic, Attic, Massiliot and Corinthian A and B amphoras as well. Plain jugs believed to be Rhodian in origin strengthen the likelihood (based principally on the transport amphoras) that the ship originated in the eastern Aegean. In addition to amphoras, bf kylikes and bf and rf askoi, skyphoi and oenocho- ai, most of them Attic, were being carried, as well as plain bg cups, plates and lamps. One Attic bf oenochoe shows Athena battling with the giant Enceladus. An arm of a wooden statuette, a terracotta figurine of a boar, four painted house- altars, a bronze tripod, two wicker baskets and two clay weights were also on board, but may have belonged to the crew rather than being carried as cargo. Of these items two Attic rf askoi (painted with sileni and banqueting youths respectively, attributed to Epictetus or his circle), a pair of altars and the bronze tripod were included in the 1996 Venice exhibition and have received detailed catalogue entries (West- ern Greeks 636, no. 8). Details of the ship itself have also emerged: it is 17.40m long and 6.40m wide, built of pine for the hull and oak for the inner parts. The mast-step also survived, 52cm wide. The interior of the hull was pitch-lined; the exterior was probably covered by protective sheathing, judging from the finds of lead that have been made. Also preserved in part was rush matting covering the deck. The ship's planks were not only connected with one another by vegetable cord through holes bored obliquely, but use mortise and tenon joints as well (Fig. 31). The wreck therefore marks the point of transition in shipbuilding techniques from the sewn-plank system to mortise and tenon, of which the Gela ship may be the earliest example yet known. The detailed publication of this spectacular wreck-site is awaited with keen interest. In Gela itself, more of the A and C sacred area (cf. D. Adamesteanu, NSc 1960, 87) has been investigated in Piazza Calvario, at the eastern end of Gela, a short distance W of the archaeological museum. An A shrine has been located here with further remains of fragmentary architectural terracottas, including gorgon antefixes of the late 6th/5th Ct BC. A late-5th-Ct tile collapse and burnt layer probably marks the Carthaginian sack of 405 BC (S. Amata, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 867). The most important work on terrafirma during the last few years at Gela, however, has been Dr Fiorentini's renewed investigation of the emporion or port area of ancient Gela. This lies in what is now a eucalyptus wood (Bosco Littorio) immediately S of the acropolis, where two units of buildings 5m apart, with mud brick walls still over 2m high, have been uncovered. So good was the preservation that the dimensions of the mud bricks used were still easily ascertain- able (48 x 25 x 6cm), and the holes for the ceiling joists (diameter 2cm) of the floor above were also preserved in the walls. Finds are few as only surface excavation for the most part has taken place; only one room was partially cleared to floor level (white plaster was still intact on the interior walls). Roof tiles, however, are of 6th/5th Ct BC types (G. Fiorentini, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 23). A Convegno was held in Gela to discuss the results of this work, and publication of its proceedings is anticipated. Also of great interest are two excavations on flat ground on the N side of the acropolis near</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 the old railway station: one ('Scala Ferrovario') has revealed an archaic habitation quarter (late 7th/early 6th Ct BC), with a regular street-plan on the same orientation as the buildings of the emporion. Part of it may have been an industrial quarter, as suggested by the discovery of a circular kiln. The quarter was still occupied in the 5th Ct. The other, close to the N slopes of the hill (via Veneria), consisted of a bothros with a mass of pottery, also running from the late 7th Ct BC to the end of the 5th: the 6th Ct material included Ionic cups and plenty of Cor, including a kotyle with a rare representation of the Trojan horse. What all this suggests is that A Gela is much larger than has hitherto been thought, with planned settlement occupying, as at Selinus (cf. AR 1981-82 101), not just the acropolis area but spilling over to the flat ground on either side of it (G. Fiorentini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 721). It similarly implies that the line of the A defences at Gela should be sought, not clinging to the edge of the plateau (as the HL defences at Capo Soprano do) but further N and S of this line (again the situation at Selinus is comparable). On the medieval archaeology of Gela a first start has been made: pottery production in the medieval town (when it was called not Gela or Terranova but, confusingly, Heraclea) has been considered by Sicily's leading exponent in medieval pottery studies, Professor A. Ragona (Federico HI, 95; cf. also N. Cuomo di Caprio and S. Fiorilla for a pioneering scientific study of 14th-15th Ct proto-maiolica ware from Caltanissetta and Gela: SicArch xxvii.85-86 [1994] 7). Also initiated is the investigation of the imposing castle of Frederick II at Castellu- ccio, 7km N of Gela, where three phases have been identified; occupation did not continue much beyond the end of the 15th Ct (BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 27; cf. also Federico II, 85; cf. also S. Fiorilla, SicArch xxii.71 [1989] 7). Gela was in fact the venue for an important exhibition on medieval archaeology in 1990, the catalogue of which, edited by S. Scuto, Fornaci, castelli e pozzi dell'etei di mezzo: primi contributi di archeolo- gia medievale nella Sicilia centro-meridionale (Gela/Agrigento 1990), pp. 234, will be of lasting value as a pioneering treatment of its subject. The city has also been the venue for conferences on earlier periods, on 'La pace di Gela del 424 a.C.' in November 1988, and on 'I porti antichi del Mediterran- eo' in March 1995, but I have seen the Atti of neither in print. Among other work Dr R. Panvini has recently published an introduction to Geloan archaeology and history in Gelas: storia e archeologia dell'antica Gela (Turin: Societa editrice internaz- ionale, 1996), pp. 172, which I have not yet seen. Professor E. De Miro has summarised the advances in our knowledge of Geloan coroplastic art as a result of excavations undertaken in the late 1970s and early 1980s (in Hestiasis: studi di tarda antichitei offerti a Salvatore Calderone III [Messina 1986, publ. 1988] 387), including late 6th Ct gorgon antefixes from the acropolis, a fine terracotta head of Kore with polos, and numerous statuettes of types already well-known at Gela, such as both standing and seated Athenas, and the seated goddess with strings of 'dates' suspended from her chest - the so-called Athena Lindia type, which I prefer to interpret as Demeter/Kore (R.J.A. Wilson, Cambridge Ancient History, Plates to volume IV [Cambridge 1988] 190 no. 254). One part of the Geloan coroplastic material, that of the female protomai of c. 540-490, has now been minutely examined by J. Uhlen- brock, The terracotta protomai from Gela: a discussion of local style in archaic Sicily (Rome 1988), who has identified 37 types, and emphasized the independence and originality of Geloan coroplasts once they had left behind the E Gr models which their early examples closely follow. Immediately below the E end of the Gela acropolis is the hill of Bitalemi, where Orlandini excavated a chthonic sanctuary underneath a R farm in the 1960s (Kokalos 12 [1966] 8). Emergency excavation here because of erosion and clandestine digging produced inter alia a bg fragment inscribed 'Thesmo- phor', confirming Orlandini's hypothesis that this was indeed a cult to Demeter Thesmophoros (G. Fiorentini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 721). In the Geloan hinterland there are a number of key hill-top settlements about which we are much better informed thanks to the researches of the past two decades. One is Monte Bubbonia, 23km N of Gela, on which we now have a full account of both Orsi's and Adamesteanu's unpublished excavations, thanks to the devoted labours of D. Pancucci and M.C. Naro, Monte Bubbonia, campagne di scavo 1905, 1906, 1955 [Sikelika 4] (Rome: Giorgio Bretschneider, 1992), pp. 205. This describes in detail for the first time the 'anaktoron' (an A shrine) and the fortifications (129-42), as well as tombs and their contents (143-68), while the first half of the book (9-128) lists small finds, although many lack a secure context. About 40% belong to the 6th Ct, but the overall time-span stretches from the late 8th to the 4th Ct BC (cf. also Nissa a Maktorion 71 for a summary of work undertaken at this site in the 1970s). Another site is Monte Saraceno di Ravanusa, 30km W of Bubbonia and 20km N of Licata, the scene of a series of highly profitable campaigns during the 1970s and 1980s (AR 1981-82 98; 1987-88 129). Excavations in 1987/88 and again in 1991/2 produced two major additions to our knowledge of this settlement: in the more easterly of the two fortifications a 1-m wide gate was discovered, with scanty occupation going down into the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC, after which the site was abandoned; but underneath what had hitherto thought to have been the earliest occupation layers on the site, belonging to the IA S. Angelo Muxaro/Polizzello and Thapsos cultures, Castelluccian levels (c. 1800/1400 BC) have now been found, and even earlier occupation below that. The other surprise was the discovery below the late 4th Ct defenc- es, at least on this E side, that there was an earlier fortification, not precisely dated but certainly archaic, which had been violently destroyed towards the end of the 4th Ct and replaced by the visible circuit walls (BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 21; A. Siracusano, QuadMess 5 [1990] 41; ead., Atti III Valle Himera 87). The results of the necropolis excavations in 1978-82 and 1985 have also been briefly reported (A. Denti, ibid. 97). Nor does this exhaust the list of hill-tops in the plain of Gela where research has been conducted in the last few years. At Monte Desusino near Butera (NSc 1958, 335), more of the powerful defences with towers at regular intervals have been uncovered in the NW and SW sectors, and an early 4th Ct BC date for them confirmed; the wall varies in width between 1.80m and 2 m. A gate on the W side of these defences has also been found; it is of the pincer ('a tenaglio') type, 14m wide at its outer face, 8m wide on the inner. Within the defences a 8-m. diameter hut of the 8th/7th Ct BC has been excavated, with a primary occupation layer containing local pottery (e.g. scodelloni and cups), imported LPC cups and a fragment of E Gr (Rhodian) bird bowl; these presumably represent trading contacts with Gela. Of later occupation, what is interpreted as a small 6th Ct shrine, only 3m long, has been identified on the hill-top, as well as a quarter of houses of the 4th Ct BC. The site seems to have been abandoned in the early decades of the 3rd Ct BC. On the slopes of the hill 13 burials of a necropolis were uncovered (mostly of enchytrismos type); they produced bg skyphoi, Ionic B2 cups and other material belonging to the period c. 550-490 BC. Two rooms of a small farm, allegedly of the 4th Ct BC, were also found nearby (R. 99</page><page sequence="42">100 R. J. A. WILSON Panvini, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 36; ead., Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 757). Another hill-town under fresh investigation is that in contrada Canalotti E of Monte Dessueri, where Paolo Orsi explored over 1,500 tombs at the beginning of this century (Monumenti cantichi 21 [1913] 349; Tusa, Preistorial, 579). New excavations were begun here in 1991 and have revealed a further 200 rock-cut chamber tombs, some of them double, with dromos and openings up to 1.50m high; all were of the tombe a forno type. These were rich in pottery finds of Cassibile-like culture (Tomb 17 was especially prolific), and there were some bronze brooches too, reflecting the discoveries of Orsi (R. Panvini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 810; F. Nicoletti, ibid. 816). A gold ring (supposedly of Mycenaean workman- ship) is among the finds from the most recent campaign (1994/5). In addition to the necropolis, the accompanying settlement of the 12th to 7th Ct BC has also been explored, and a large rectangular building (another 'anaktoron' to use Orsi's terminology?) has been identified. Omphake has been put forward as a possible name for this site (contrast P. Orlandini, Kokalos 7 [1961] 145, who placed it at Butera: cf. Manni, Geografia, 212 for the sources). Of other sites in the Geloan hinterland, an EBA settlement with huts has recently been identified in contrada Garrasia, adjacent to Monte Dessueri (C. Guzzone, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 845). Work has also begun at nearby Monte Maio, where levels of MBA and LBA occupation were succeeded by a habitation quarter with rectangular houses of the 7th and 6th Ct BC, containing inter- alia decorated Cor pottery and pithoi. Further away from Gela, in the hilly heartlands of the interior, a number of sites around the provincial capital of Caltanissetta have recently come under scrutiny: the results of the work during the 1980s was presented in an exhibition held at the Museo civico in Caltanissetta in 1990 and helpfully summarised in an accompanying book published at the time of the exhibition, G. Fiorentini (ed.), Da Nissa a Maktorion: nuovi contributi per I'archeologia della provincia di Caltanissetta (Caltanissetta 1990), pp. 104, with all-colour pictures of the finds (hereafter Nissa a Maktorion). Nor should we omit to mention here a more substantial work dealing with the archae- ology of this part of Sicily, C. Micciche, Mesogheia: archeolo- gia e storia della Sicilia centro-meridionale dal VII al IV secolo a.C. (Caltanissetta and Rome, 1989), pp. 204. In Caltanissetta itself (contrada Palmintelli), a locality where indigenous pottery was noted in the late 1950s (P. Orlandini, Kokalos 7 [1962] 208), an 'a grotticella' tomb excavated in 1988 produced a burial with intact indigenous painted oenoch- oai of the 7th Ct BC, superimposd on an EBA Castelluccian tomb beneath (BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 41; Nissa a Maktorion, 21). On Monte S. Giuliano, immediately N of Caltanissetta, two elliptical huts of the 7th/6th Ct BC were associated with Polizzello-style pottery (and overlay a BA Castelluccian village); they were joined in the mid-6th Ct by a rectangular structure with an apse. Finds included an indigen- ous terracotta of a female figure (a divinity?), and much painted indigenous pottery, including an imitation Cor krater; there was virtually no imported pottery apart from a few scraps of Cor, and Ionic B 1 and B2 cups. The site was deserted after the end of the 6th Ct (ibid. 13; R. Panvini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 755). A third hill-top site is Vassallaggi near S. Cataldo, about 7km SW of Caltanissetta, first explored in 1956 (D. Adamesteanu, RA 44 [1957] 134), and then again in 1983-86 (Nissa a Maktorion, 47). In 1988 a further campaign took place in three separate sectors of the indigenous necrop- olis on 'Hill 5'. In sector A, the graves are all of the artificial- cave type ('a grotticella'), arranged in two rows along a vertical cliff-face 5m high (the upper row having larger tombs than the lower). Burials were all by multiple inhumation and were being made throughout the 6th and the first half of the 5th Ct BC, with lots of indigenous painted wares, and personal objects like bronze rings, bracelets, brooches, knives etc. Only after c. 550 BC do the earliest imports arrive (Corinthian and Attic), and local wares become more influenced by Gr decor- ative patterns; particularly common among local pottery shapes was a globular pyxis with vertical handles and a high foot (Nissa a Maktorion, 57). At the foot of the slope below these tombs in sector A is a R site of early/mid-imperial date known only from surface sherding (ARS) (cf. also D. Gulli, QuadMess 6 [1991, publ. 1994] 23). The best known of the sites around Caltanissetta, however, is undoubtedly Sabucina, where recent work in the A sacral area S of the walls (AR 1981-82 97) has shown that it was larger then previously realised, with a new area W of the main structures rich in votive material of the last quarter of the 6th Ct BC. Other small roofed structures, perhaps to take votives (or further small shrines in themselves?), have been found near the main shrines; one had a clay bust of Demeter in it, confirming that this was indeed a chthonic sanctuary (as had earlier been surmised from the pig bones: AR 1981-82 97 ), and also a statuette of the seated goddess of 'Athena Lindia' type, which, as I have argued elsewhere (R.J.A. Wilson, Cambridge Ancient History Plates to Vollume IV [1988] no. 254), is also likely to represent Demeter. The sanctuary was destroyed in the mid-5th Ct BC, perhaps during Ducetius' uprising against the Greeks, and then the area was reshaped in the late 5th/early 4th Ct with a simple rectangular building, 11.5m long, decorated with Silenus antefixes. It too was abandoned by the end of the 4th Ct BC, but 600 years later (2nd/3rd Ct AD) four burials, one inside an amphora, were planted in the ruins of the 4th Ct BC building. Within the defences four further circular huts (of 12th-10th Ct BC date) have been identified, some with rectangular 'porches' added to one side (R. Panvini, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 794; Nissa a Maktorion, 31; R. Mollo Mezzena, Atti III Valle Himera 137). A new Antiquarium has recently been opened at this site. Work at another nearby hill-top settlement at Gibil Gabib in 1984-86 has also been briefly reported (by C. Micciche, Atti III Valle Himera 183), when evidence for three successive periods of occupation, in the mid-7th, mid-6th and 4th Ct was uncovered. Nor has the R period in Caltanissetta province been neglected, fresh impetus having been given to investigating places first put on the archaeological map by Dinu Adamesteanu and Pietro Orlandini 30 years ago. At Sabucina Bassa, where the probable site of a rich villa (cf. Wilson, Sicily, 213-4) has been greatly disturbed by deep ploughing for a vineyard, a small necropolis has been excavated on a knoll dominating the site (contrada Lannari). The forty burials were all inhumations in slab-lined graves, and the individuals were on average c. 1.50 m. in height. Most of them died at c. 40 years, and were laid to rest all with their heads to E. Teeth were in poor shape, with much wear and many dental cavities: they indicate a cereal-dominated diet, but one supplemented by other foodstuffs rich in sugar content and poor in calcium. The grave goods included local and African pottery of the later 1st Ct to the beginning of the 3rd Ct AD. A number of signed lamps attest the names of Sicilian lamp-makers, including one from the Proclus Agyrios factory (Wilson, Sicily, 260), its ring-handle surmounted by a relief head of Hercules. Other lamps with name-stamps include examples by the well-known lamp-maker C. Iun(ius) Drac(o) and one by the less documented Attin(i)us. Associated coins are</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 mainly mid-2nd to early 3rd Ct AD. Among other finds were glassware, and amphoras from both Spain and Sicilian Naxos (R. Panvini. Kokalos 39-40 11993-94] 787; ead. and G. Zavettieri, ibid. 851 ). At Piano Camera, 12km NE of Gela, where earlier exploration, limited to recording surface debris, indicated a rural agglomeration of c. 3 ha. (FA 6 [1951] no. 4620), excavation since 1987 has revealed the partial plans of several superimposed farms stretching from A to LR. The earliest phase of activity here is Copper Age. Then, in the 6th/5th Ct BC. pieces of painted architectural terracottas. and fragments of votive clay statuettes with pendents (the necklace, breasts and-one arm survive of the best preserved), suggest the presence of an A Gr shrine, probably to Demeter, not fre- quented afterl the mid-5th Ct BC. The shrine was succeeded (as at Bitalemii, see above) by a fa-rm in the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC. Little could be recovered of its plan, because it in turn was replaced. after a hiatus in occupation in the 2nd and 1st Ct BC, by a new rectangular farm of which seven roolns have been excavated. It belongs apparently to the Ist Ct AD, and was occupied into the early 3rd Ct. on the basis of a coin of Vespasian, Italian sigillata pottery (including stamps of L. Tettius Samia) and ARS. In the 4th/5th Ct AD another farm was built over it, but on a different orientation from its predecessor. Three rooms of this later structure were uncovered, and a fourth room belonged to an independent building to the SW. ARS includes examples of Hayes 58B, 67, 91A and 93 and lamps; there is also a fragment of ARS relief ware (Hayes 53) showing the raising of the paralytic. The excavations have also yielded tile stamps. GALBA fi-om the early imperial farm, ECNATI from the LR one. Both stamps were already attested at Piano Camera, and the former occurs on other sites as well (Wilson, Sicilh, figs. 176.2-3. 19-20; also fig. 229a), but the importance of the new work is that we now have for the first time a secure chronology for these tile stamps, hitherto known largely from surface finds (BCASicilia ix-x.3 11988-89] 43: R. Panvini and V. Caminneci, Kokalos 39-40 [1993-94] 825). WESTERN SICILY Provinces of Palermo and Trapani At Palermo, one of the most significant happenings in recent years has been a splendid exhibition held in the Museo Archeologico in 1991-93 which focused on the advances made in archaeological research in the province of Palermo over the previous decade (cf. Archeologia Viva x.25 [December 1991] 56). The beautifully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition (already mentioned briefly above in the Introduction), C.A. Di Stefano (ed.), Di Terra in Terra: nov'e scolperte a(rcheologiche nella plrovincia di Palerimo (Palermo: museo archeologico regionale, 1993, pp. 316; hereafter Terra in terra), with mostly colour illustrations, and full descriptive catalogue of all the items on show, is a most welcome, handsome and useful record of the mostra and of the research it presented. More recently, another exhibition, organised under the direction of Dr Agata Villa, has put the spotlight on the Punic phase of Palermo's past: 'Palermo punica', which opened in the same museum in May 1995, is set to continue to the end of 1996. Another catalogue accompanying the exhibition is due to be produced, but is not yet to hand as I write. The museum has also recently received something it has long lacked, a decent guide-book, and S. Moscati and C.A. Di Stefano, Palernmo: mIIiseo archeol- ogico (Palermo and Rome 1991, pp. 128), a volume in the Fig. 32 'Musei di Sicilia' series, is an attractive book to be warmly welcomed; as with that for Agrigento (see above), this is also available in an abbreviated version under the same title (pp. 63). In the excavation in 1989 and 1992/3 in Caserma Turkory on the Corso Calatafimi. in the area of the extensive necropolis on the W side of the ancient city, excavation has revealed a series of archaic tombs, the oldest of c. 600/550 BC, but mostly belonging to the period c. 525/475. There were also some HL burials, all cremiations within amphoras. The 1989 excavations (Terl-l in terrCa 287) revealed 50 burials, of which 37 were inhumations and 13 (26%) cremations; where the sex was identifiable, 44'S were male, 24% female; adults generally lived to between 25 and 40 years. One of the oldest (c. 600/575) is Tomb 42, an inhumation burial of a woman over 45 years old with nine iteims of grave goods (including a Corinthian aryballos depicting winged panthers); she had 'cribra orbitalia' (see below on Selinus, last paragraph), indicating malnutrition and secondary anaemia. In one late-6th Ct burial (Tomb 30) the body had been cremated inside a stone sarcophagus: its accompanying grave goods included a LC aryballos and Ionic B2 cups of the late 6th Ct BC. Tonlb 41, of a child aged four, contained three faience Horus eyes and a terracotta statuette of a man with a tray on his head, presumab- ly toys, of early 5th Ct date. Tomb 18 contained a skeleton showing deformities in the vertebral column caused by tuberculosis; another, in Tomb 36, had lost all teeth fiom the lower jaw. Other novelties worth individual mention include Tomb 30, an adult male buried with a Corinthian aryballos and an iron lance. Two glass paste scarabs were found in chamber tombs 25 and 38, and a Punic anthropomorphic statuette in Tomb 41. The photo (Fig. 32) shows the exhibition re-creation 101</page><page sequence="44">102 R. J. A. WILSON of Tomb 18, a rock-cut chamber tomb 1.80 x 1.52m (appr- oached by a staircase leading down to it) with an enchvltrismlos burial in the Punic amphora in the centre of the chamber. There were three other cremations in the chamber and a single inhumation as well, covered by slabs: 26 vessels in all had been placed in the tomb, including Attic and Ionic B 1 cups and a bg lamp. The date is in the second half of the 6th Ct BC. Elsewhere in Palermo, work on the defences briefly reported in AR 1987-88 138) continued in 1990 in the Sala Duca Montalto in the Palazzo Reale. This, the first serious modern excavation of the defences, shows that the earliest phase is 5th Ct, with a gate 5.18m wide, flanked by a tower and by a small postern (0.90m wide, 2m high) with a rounded arch cut to this shape out of two horizontally-placed solid blocks (i.e. not a voussoir arch). The wall is built of perfectly squared and neatly laid blocks, clearly under Gr influence. In early HL times the postern was blocked, the gate narrowed, and strengthening walls were built against the outer face of the C defences, in inferior-quality blocks which contrast markedly with those of the earlier masonry (C.A. Di Stefano, Terra in terra 255; ead., in V. Giustolisi, ed., Panoriimus II [Palermo 1990] 133; R. Camerata Scovazzo, ibid. 95). Also on the defences, Dr A Tullio has studied again a long-visible stretch of heavily restored walls in via A. Amedeo, with good photographs of Punic masons' marks (in id., ed., I beni clultiurali e il lor) rllolo nella societa [Atti del Convegno, Palermo 12 aprile 1992], Palermo: Lions Club Distretto 108 Y, 1992, 28). Other small-scale excavations, with finds from A to medieval, can be followed in the pages of Terra in terra 259-75; while an investigation below the floor of the crypt of Palermo cathedral revealed fragmentary features (a pit, a cocciop)esto floor) and a wealth of material from the 5th Ct BC to LR and beyond (C.A. Di Stefano, BCASicilia n.s. i-ii.2 [1991-921 38). Among other work, some traces of HL burials have been recently located to the SE of the ancient walled circuit of Panormus, S of the harbour; and we also note that to the NE of the ancient city, in Piazza delle 13 Vittime, there was no trace of suburban occupation before the Arabo-Norman period. Nor has the Arab and early medieval archaeology of Palermo been ignored. We now have a useful interim report on 1986 excavations in the Castello S. Pietro near the Piazza delle 13 Vittime, which produced important well-dated deposits of medieval pottery (L. Arcifa et al., BCASicilia vi-viii.2 [198587, publ. 1989] 30). Roger II's suburban palace at Maredolce, together with a huge artificial lake and central island, has been recorded; the limpid waters of this lake and the palm tress on its isle were noted with enthusiasm by 12th-Ct writers (B. Todaro, Archeologia Viva xiii.47 [September/October 1994] 74). More extraordinarily, the peace of Frederick II was dis- turbed again (the last was in 1781) in his splendid sarcophagus in Palermo Cathedral. In connection with the grand exhibition about him mentioned in the Introduction above, on the 800th anniversary of his birth, a microprobe endoscopy was carried out, inserting the high-tech equipment through a tiny hole in the sarcophagus. It revealed a state of affairs similar to that reported in the 18th Ct: Frederick is indeed still there, clutch- ing his heavily corroding imperial globe, but has to suffer the indignity of a couple of other bodies, one in a sack, which at some later stage have been hurled in on top of him (M. Micheli and M. Vidale, Archeo x.9 [September 1995] 12). Among other work on ancient Palermo, there is a brief summary of the current state of knowledge in I. Tamburello, Palermo, citta delle origini (Palermo: Herbitu editrice, pp. 96 + 57 plates), and several articles of archaeological interest in the three volumes edited and published by V. Giustolisi, Panormiis I (Palermo 1988. pp. 158). Pianorlius II (Palermno 1990) and Palelrmo III (Palerlno 1991 ). For the R period there is much of importance in the papers by various hands (A. Giardina, L. Bivona, A. Tusa Cutroni. 0. Belvedere and R.M. Bonacasa Carra) in the pages of Kokalos 33 (1987) 225-337. We may note the full publication for the first time of the second, less well-preserved of Palermo's two Orpheus mosaics, found in via Maqueda in 1872 (P. Minh. BdA" Ixxix.83 [19941 1), and comments on a framlnent of a Palerilitan sarcophagus of c. 250 by M.A. Lima. a prolegomenon to a fuller study of Palermo's LR sarcophagi on which Dr Lima is currently working (Stlidi Tlusa 105). R. Boncasa Carra has rounded up what little we know about the paleochristian catacombs and hypogea of Palermo (in Qiiaeritiir invlentuls colitlir: mis(cellanea in on0ore di (padre Uimberto Maria Fasola [Vatican city 19891 51), but apart from a modest hypogeum discovered recently in via Himera just to the W of the ancient city, there is little new that has been discovered since the fundamental work of J. Fuhrer and V. Schultze nearly ninety years ago (Die altchristli- chen Gratbstiitten [Berlin 19071 220). On Monte Pellegrino, the ancient Heirkte, the brooding rock (606m high) thought by Goethe to be the most beautiful promon- tory in the world, a small-scale excavation in 1992 ftund HL and R material extending from the 4th/3rd Ct BC down into the 4th Ct AD; a cistern with Punic amphoras and other HL material was also located, as well as a dry-stone wall m wide. The latter was thought to have been part of a temenos wall (an interpreta- tion perhaps influenced by the fact that the shrine of S. Rosalia is nearby), but evidence is scanty. A. Vigliardi and C.A. Di Stefano have reported on Palaeolithic settlement and on a R tomb on the W slopes of the rock respectively, in V. Giustolisi (ed.), Planormus III (Palermo 1991), 55. At Solunto, where earlier work had established that the Phoenician colony, the Soloeis of Thuc. 6.2.6, lay on the bay of S. Flavia, below the rock on which the visible HL city stands (AR 1987-88 138), new excavations in 1991-92 (Dr C. Greco) have revealed two well-preserved pottery kilns of the bilobed shape familiar from discoveries at Mozia (G. Falsone, Struttura e origine orientale dei fo1rni a vLasalio di Mo2ia [Palermo 19811), with central pier in the middle of each combustion chamber; they belong to the second half of the 5th Ct BC or early in the 4th. Below this, successive earlier occupation layers were found, including one surface of c. 500 BC with Ionic B2 cups and Attic bf fragments, and a burnt layer below that with Ionic B1 cups and some fragments of Etruscan bucchero. The settlement seems to have been at its most flourishing and extensive state in the 5th Ct, but then in the early 4th Ct BC came abandonment, apparently after violent destruction, and the decision was taken to transfer to the nearby hilltop, in the interests of greater security. At the nearby lido in 1992 some Punic tombs with approach drom1oi were excavated, forming part of the A necropolis (Kokalos 30-31 [1984-851 599 for earlier discoveries); one produced an Attic bg cup and a pair of bronze earrings (cf. also A. Villa, Studi Tusa 215, for a useful summary of what is known about all Solunto's necropolises to date). A little further S, between the railway line and the coastal road in the bay of Porto Spagna, Solanto, LR sherds indicate a farm or small village (P. Lo Cascio, SicArch xxiii.73 [1990] 33). No excavation is currently under way in the HL city on the rock, but recent publications concerning it include articles by A. Wiegand (Mitteilungen des DAI, Riinmische Abteilung 98 [ 1991 ] 121), by V. Tusa (in Saggi in onore di G. de Angelis d'Ossat [Rome 1987] 77, on the house erroneously called the 'gymnasium' because of the gymnasiarch inscription JIG XIV.3111 found</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 34 Fig. 33 there in 1865) and by S. Medeksza (Etudes et traveaux ... de 'Acadcmie des sciences poloncaises 14 [1990] 91, on the town-plan and house-layout of Solunto). We may also note the publication of a decent guidebook to the ruins of Solunto (much of which remains essentially unpublished), a long-felt lacuna now admirably filled by A. Cutroni Tusa, A. Italia, D. Lima and V. Tusa, Solunto [Itinerari XV] (Rome: Istituto Poligrafico dello Stato, 1994); and also long-overdue is a project to safeguard and restore the crumbling ruins (A. Italia, SicArch xxvi.82 [1993] 23). A work of lasting value is the exhaustive monograph by Dr Agata Villa on I capitelli di Sollunto [Sikelika 3] (Rome: Giorgio Bretschneider, 1988, pp. 150), which in providing a detailed catalogue of over 200 Doric, Ionic and Corinthian capitals from the site, mostly belonging to the 2nd/lst Ct BC, has implications for such studies well beyond the site itself and indeed the island of Sicily. We have here, for example, a useful supplement on the Sicilian HL capitals of the Corinthian order studied by H. Lauter-Bufe (Die Geschichte des Sikeliotisch-Korinthischen Kapitells [Mainz 19871), and what is in effect the first detailed account of another original Sicilian contribution to HL archi- tecture, the Ionic diagonal capital with oblique palmettes set between the volutes. Further E along the coast is the bustling town of Termini Imerese, successor of Gr Himera after the latter's demise in 409 BC, and as Thermae Himeraeae one of the more important towns of R Sicily. This has been the scene of patient excavation and research over many years by Professor Oscar Belvedere of Palermo University, whose earlier work has included important studies of the amphitheatre and aqueduct (AR 1987-88 138). Now he and a team of colleagues have produced the first definitive account of the archaeology of the town and its attendant cemeteries: 0. Belvedere et al., Termini Imerese: ricerche di topografia e archeologia urbana (Palermo: Istituto di archeologia, Universita di Palermo, 1993, pp. 391, plus a separate sleeve with folding plans) is a milestone in the study of a R Sicilian city, with its full catalogue and discussion of over 1300 small finds (nearly all illustrated with profiles), which all too often get neglected in Sicilian archaeological publications. This is an important volume with widespread relevance for Sicilian R studies as a whole. The book contains reports on the latest excavations, mostly small-scale, conducted in the town in 1989-1990 (Piazza V. Emanuele, via Garibaldi, via Iannelli), and also in the HL necropolis of the 2nd/lst Ct BC (Piazza Gancia) and the W necropolis of Giancaniglia, which is later (R imperial) in date (cf. also Terra in terra 231). Termini Imerese is also fortunate to have had its epigraphic material as well subjected to such full and scholarly treatment: L. Bivona, Iscrizioni latine lapidarie del museo civico di Termini Imerese [Sikelika VIII] (Rome: Giorgio Bretschneider, 1994), pp. 317, is another impressive volume to place beside her earlier invaluable catalogue of the Palermitan inscriptions. At Himera, 12km E of Termini Imerese, work has concen- trated on the lower town, on the coastal plain N of the acrop- olis, where hitherto the Gr temple built after the battle in 480 has been the principal known landmark. Now over 350 tombs in the Pestavecchia necropolis, on the E bank of the Himera river, have been excavated since 1990 (S. Vassallo, Terra in terra 89 for a report on the first 145 burials). Buried under deep layers of alluvial soil (Fig. 33), there is no surface indication of their existence, and so they have not suffered the same fate as most Sicilian necropolises, the depredations of the clandestini. The funeral rites are varied: cremation is attested from the end of the 7th Ct BC to the beginning of the 5th, but inhumation had mostly supplanted it by the mid-6th Ct; the ratio overall of cremation to inhumation is approximately 20%:80%. Enchytrismos (burial in amphoras, with head generally to E), pithoi, hydriai and kraters are also attested, often clay-sealed after deposition: tomb 381, for example, contained the burial of a child under one year old, wearing bronze earrings (Fig. 34). Some inhumations were placed 103</page><page sequence="46">104 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 35 Fig. 36 straight in the sand (usually supine, occasionally laid on their side, and only once with knees drawn up), some are a cappucc- ina, and one (Tomb 92) is set within a container with mud- brick walling (the bricks measure 47 x 33 x 10cm; cf. Gela, Bosco Littorio, above). Tomb 434, of the second half of the 6th Ct BC (Fig. 35), was unique: an inhumation, probably for Fig. 37 a child (soil conditions did not lend themselves to good skeletal preservation), was placed within a pit encircled with stones and furnished with cups and a small jug as well as a Corinthian A amphora, the latter broken before deposition. The amphoras used for burials, apart from Corinthian (which occurs the most commonly), include some Attic (Fig. 36: SOS type Late II, c. 600 BC, firom tomb 102), Samian and other E Gr types (Clazomenae and 'Thasos-Mende'), as well as of course locally-made containers (as in tomb 74 [Fig. 37] or Tomb 105 [Fig. 38]). The presence also of Etruscan amphoras (Fig. 33, right of centre: Tomb 306) is not surprising for a Sicilian city on the N coast; there are also some Punic containers, and even (in 7th-Ct burials) the occasional Phoenician amphora as well. The amphoras alone give a splendid panorama of the wide commercial contacts enjoyed by Himera in the A and C periods. Other grave goods, mostly of very small vessels, included Corinthian pottery, two Laconian vases (an aryballos and an amphora), a little Attic (one identified as work of the Swan Painter) and 'Samian' lekythoi and amphorettas; two/four vessels is normal per grave (the maximum is 11 pieces, in tomb 144), curiously often intermingled with carefully chosen beach pebbles. Metal finds were few: apart from the bronze earrings in Fig. 34, there was one pair of silver earrings. In addition to this E necropolis, work has also begun, in 1991/92, on the west necropolis of the lower city, where emergency excavation has uncovered about 40 tombs of a cemetery extending from the end of the 6th Ct BC to the end</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 of the 5th. Most of the burials were cremations placed inside a trench, but there were some enchytrismos burials with new-born children within amphoras. Particularly interesting was the evidence from one burial of the cremation having taken place inside the trench (grave offerings were burnt), and the bones were then collected and placed inside an Attic rf krater of c. 450 BC showing scenes from the palaestra. A specially dug pit was then dug into the bottom of the cremation trench to receive the krater, which was covered by a roof tile at the same level as the trench bottom. In the inhabited quarter of the lower town (AR 1987-88 139), E of the Himera river but W of the Pestavecchia necrop- olis, houses buried beneath 2m of alluvial sand were found to have dry-stone walls and floors of beaten earth; there was a complete absence of roof tiles. The size of the insulae in this quarter is unclear, but at least three ambitus have been ident- ified, giving an insula width of at least 16.50m., differentiating them from those of the upper town. After a little haphazard 7th Ct occupation, the quarter seems to have been laid out properly in the first half of the 6th Ct BC (Ionic B 1 cups are associated with early layers), but was abandoned in the first quarter of the 5th Ct for reasons that are as yet unclear. Destruction, how- ever, appears to have been violent, and the temptation is to link this with a razing by the Carthaginians prior to the Battle of Himera in 480. All this can be followed in detail in the splendidly full and prompt report on the 1989-1992 excavations which has already appeared from the pens of N. Allegro and S. Vassallo (Kokalos 38 [1992] 79). The considerable size of this lower city needs to be taken into account when estimating Himera's population: if David Asheri is right in calculating the city's population on the plateau as 10,000 (with a further 10,000 in the chora: Rivista di Filologia classica 101 [1973] 457), which averages out as 3,000/4,000 inhabitants per 20 ha, then the whole population of Himera in its prime at the beginning of the 5th Ct, including the lower city, may have filled about 80 ha and amounted to between 16,000 and 18,000 souls. The lower town, probably connected to harbour installa- tions, did not extend as far as the modern coastline: geomorphological work makes it clear that the ancient shore was some 200m inland from the present beach. Meanwhile, work is nearing completion on the full publica- tion of earlier excavations. In particular the imminent appear- ance of N. Allegro (ed.), Himera 111.2: le aree sacre (Rome, L'Erma di Bretschneider, due 1996), on the excavations of the temple precinct in the NE corner of the acropolis, is destined to become a major landmark in Himeran studies: pending its appearance, there is a useful summary of conclusions by Professor Allegro, with details of phases and selective presenta- tion of finds, in Terra in terra 65-84. Major analyses of the coinage of Himera have been and are being undertaken. The late Colin Kraay's magisterial The archaic coinage of Himera (Naples 1984) escaped the net at the time of my last AR; a sequel on the C coinage is being prepared by C. Arnold Biucchi (for a foretaste, cf. id., Numismatica e antichita, classiche 17 [1988] 85), and for the 4th Ct, we have the study of C. Boehringer in G.K. Jenkins et al. (eds.), Kraay-Morkholm essays: numismatic studies in the memory of C.M. Kraay and 0. Morkholm (Louvain-la-Neuve 1988) 29. Further east again, the indefatigable Dr Amedeo Tullio has continued his work at Cefaliu of adding, little by little, import- ant details to our knowledge of ancient Cephaloedium. In the ancient necropolis SW of the Villa Comunale a further hundred tombs in the 4th to 2nd Ct BC necropolis have been excavated, with finds very similar to those already known from here; they include, for example, a terracotta female bust as imago Fig. 38 clipeata, probably of the 3rd Ct BC, from an identical mould to those found earlier in this necropolis (AR 1987-88 140). One tomb is reported to bear an inscription which, as typically in bilingual late HL and R Sicily (Wilson, Sicily, 315) shows a mixture of Greek and Roman nomenclature: Pompeia Megala, daughter of Rufus Megas (Terra in terra 241). Immediately outside the walls on the SW side of the city, an emergency excavation in 1993 and 1994 in Discesa Paramuro (Caserma Botta) discovered a substantial rectangular building at least 20m long of early R imperial date (coin of Augustus and Livia), constructed above a cremation cemetery of which at least three burials have been identified. The only datable cremation was itself of early imperial date (fine-walled beaker and 1st Ct AD coin), so it seems that the R building followed not long afterwards. Whether it represents an isolated extra- mural building, or part of a new quarter indicating a burgeon- ing settlement at Cefalu in the early Empire, it is as yet too early to say. Inside the city, in via G. Amendola, archaeologi- cal excavation below the so-called Osterio Magno, residence of Roger II (1130-1154), during a major restoration of the building, has revealed not only structures and pottery contem- porary with Roger below the present building, but also below that again partial remains of houses and a cistern of HL date. One room still had the lower part of a pithos in situ, containing 60 coins belonging to the late 4th Ct BC, of a single type (winged Pegasus on obv.; palm on rev.); the issuing mint may be Punic, and W Sicilian. The cistern, 2.15m deep, was full of mainly late 3rd and 2nd Ct BC pottery, including plain wares, a bg lamp, and a Graeco-Italic amphora reconstructable entire. Later layers had been largely removed by the Norman builders, but LR/Byz roof tiles with combed decoration (R.J.A. Wilson, in A. McWhirr, ed., Roman brick and tile [1979] 23, now known to be not before the later 5th Ct AD: see Heraclea Minoa above), and an entire amphora of type 'Late Roman 2', an eastern import from the Aegean or Black Sea region (cf. Wilson, Sicily, 267, fig. 228, for its known Sicilian distribu- 105</page><page sequence="48">106 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 39 tion), were retrieved from a mixed deposit. The cistern has been preserved as a feature within the restored building (A. Tullio, Incontri e iniziative: memorie del centro di cultura di Ceftalu n.s. viii.1-2 [1991, publ. 1994] 57). Notes on Dr Tullio's other recent work at Cefalu can be found in the pages of Terra in terra, 241-50 and, for the decade 1976-85, in Studi Tusa 193-201. Meanwhile the local museum can also now boast of an attractive handbook in the 'Musei di Sicilia' series, which has also so far given us guides to the archaeological museums of Palermo, Lipari, Camarina and Agrigento (see above): V. Consola, V. Orlando, A. Tullio and T. Viscuso, Cefillu: museo mandralisca (Palermo and Rome 1991), pp. 104, of which 60-93 concern the archaeological collections. On the island of Ustica, 57km N of Palermo, Dr G. Mannino has reported on his investigations of four tombs in contrada Culunnedda, probably late Neolithic and so the oldest known there, as well as on Copper Age material from Grotta Azzurra and the contemporary village-site at Piano Cardoni (SicArch xxiv.75 [1991] 65). To Dr Mannino we also owe the first exploration (Kokalos 26-27 [1980-81] 840) of the site at Faraglioni on the E coast of Ustica, where since 1990 Pro- fessor R.R. Holloway of Brown University has resumed excavations: the site is that of a spectacularly well preserved BA village, occupied between c. 1400 and 1200 BC, and belonging to the Milazzase culture (Fig. 39). The settlement has a remarkable defensive wall, 5m wide and still standing up to 4m high, strengthened in a secondary period with four semicircular towers. They are of a type best paralleled at this period by a number of S. Italian sites, such as Scoglio del Tonno near Taranto, Porte Peroni and Coppa Navigata; for Sicily they are unique. The new excavations have shown that these defences existed also on the seaward side along the cliff edge, in one place built over destroyed remains of a house, suggesting that the seaward wall at least was a comparatively late development in the settlement's life. Just inside the W (landward) defences a number of oval and sub-rectangular structures have been uncovered, with narrow alleys (barely a metre wide) meeting at right angles the main E-W 'street'. It is too early to say whether the Faraglioni settlement had a regular overall street system comparable to that at Thapsos, and contact with the Aegean is at present indicated by a single fragment of a LH III B/C stirrup jar. Rather than search for Aegean parallels the disciplined planning may be a local response to the stresses of crowding in a densely populated settlement (O. Doonan, AJA 98 [1994] 297); but clearly conclusions are premature until more of the plan is known (geophysics may help here, as at La Muculufa; see above, under Southern Sicily). But the sensational discovery, in 1991, has been that of a fragmentary sculpture of a woman, in tufo, of which stylized indications of breasts and the rib cage survive; the piece is 19cm high and would have been between 40 and 50cm high when complete. The statue fragment came from an enclosed court in which were two circular bases, presumed to be altars, and a large pit with further Milazzese culture pottery and animal bones, especially cattle (R. Ross Holloway, SicArch xxiv.76-77 [1991] 81; Minerva iii.2 [1992] 18). Not only is the sculpture unique for its period in Sicily, but this is also the first time that a cult-place associated with the Milazzese culture has been identified. Another discovery of exceptional importance is that of four moulds producing small adzes, found in a deposit of ash and waste bronze. This is the only evidence for MBA or LBA metalworking in Sicily, apart from at Pantalica (R.R. Holloway and S.S. Lukesh, Archdologi- scherAnzeiger 1991, 359; R.R. Holloway, BCASicilia n.s. i-ii.2 [1991-92] 11; id., QuadMess 8 [19931 5; Terra in terra 186). It was near the island of Ustica that a DC9 was lost in 1980, a tragedy that has never been accounted for. In searching for the debris of the plane, an R wreck with 3rd-Ct AD African amphoras on board, including Africano I types, has been located by robot divers (Archeo vii.l [January 1992] 22; ibid. vii.8 [August 1992] 14); as it lies at a depth of 3,200m the cargo is likely to remain on the seabed. Or is it'? That modern technology is up to recording and indeed raising cargoes from deep-water wrecks has been dramatically and splendidly illustrated (despite the negative comments of D.J.L. Gibbins, IJNA 20 [19911 163) by the pioneering 'Jason' project, which</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 40 successfully mapped and then raised part of the cargo of another R ship which went down in the second half of the 4th Ct AD off the Skerki Bank, 120km W of Trapani; the depth in this case was 818m. The project was first briefly described in a popular account published in the year after the project (R.D. Ballard, R. Archbold and A.M. McCann, The lost wreck of the Isis, London and Toronto 1990), but it has now received full and scholarly monograph publication in A.M. McCann and J. Freed, Deep water archaeology: a late-Roman ship from Carthage and an ancient trade route near Skerki Bank off northwest Sicily (Journal of Roman Archaeology Supplementary series 13), Ann Arbor 1994, pp. 128. A total of 48 items were raised from the wreck, including 10 amphoras; most of the latter are Tunisian cylindricals (Keay types 3/5, 25, 31, 35 and 42), but two were examples of Keay 52, which has now been shown to have been a Sicilian amphora made at Naxos (see above). Also raised was property of the crew, including plain wares, a Pantelleria-ware cooking pot, and an ARS lamp with a running dog depicted on the discus. A selection of 17 amphoras, representing 10 types between late R Republican times and LR, was also raised from the sea-bed over a 30 sq km area 1.5km NW of the wreck, providing evidence for a possible six further wreck-sites. All this demonstrates with remarkable eloquence just how false were earlier notions (for some time now discarded) that ancient shipping hugged to the coasts for safety: these recent finds show how the open sea between Africa, Sicily and Italy was indeed a busy sea-route in R times. Elsewhere in the islands, at Cala Min- nola on the Egadi Island of Levanzo, a cargo of late Republican wine-amphoras (Dressel 1) has been lifted from a wreck site (no remains of the ship itself were detected) by Dr A. Freschi of Aquarius, the supra-Soprintendenza agency called in by the Soprintend- enze to deal with the nation's under- `----*^- water heritage. This is probably the same wreck as that first noted in 1976 (Parker, Shipwrecks, no. 150). Also of great importance for Sicilian underwater archaeology (and indeed for Sicilian medieval archaeology) is the discovery off San Vito Lo Capo of the wreck of a 12th-Ct-AD ship built of Aleppo pine, with a cargo of more than 500 probably Sicilian-made "~:~W amphoras and jars on board. Two types of amphoras are present, ident- ical in both shape and fabric to those i v-: from the contemporary wreck at Mar- &gt; ' 7 sala (Parker, Shipwrecks no. 663), If- |. . . while the jars are the same as those X 1 / I= f ,used to lighten the vault of the Zisa palace at Palermo in the 12th Ct. Two of ,-- _ :":- *''the amphoras certainly carried sugar, and _ .^-- 1t'" S ~the rest may also have done (S. Tusa and F. Faccenna, Archeo x.7 [July 1995] 96; ^i-:o..": cf. also Archeologia Viva xiv.52 [July/August 1995] 76). Of all the innumerable hill-top towns of W Sicily, that at Monte lato, the ancient letas, is by some way the most thoroughly excavated and pub- lished example, thanks to the Univer- sity of Zurich excavations directed by Professor H.P. Isler. Now in their twenty-sixth year, they continue to produce a wealth of interesting data. The results of the latest campaigns can be followed in a succession of commendably prompt and well-illustrated interim reports running in parallel in Antike Kunst (the latest is 39 [1996] 52) and in Sicilia Archeologica (the last I have seen is xxvii.85/86 [1994] 27; cf. also Terra in terra, 219). In recent years a little work has continued in the theatre, where the major restoration of the cavea is now placed at c. 200 BC, and where sandstone palmette acroteria (from the skene) can also now be added to the theatre's rich sculptural decoration. I remain unconvinced, however, that the satyrs and maenads decorating the stage building are as early as the late 4th Ct, the period assigned to them (e.g.) in the Venice exhibition (Western Greeks no. 376; contrast R.J.A. Wilson, in M. Henig, ed., Architecture ad architectural sculpture in the Roman Empire [Oxford 1990] 69-71). Recent excavation has also shown that the theatre's perimeter wall is not earlier than the end of the 3rd Ct BC. More attention in the excavations of the past eight years, however, has concentrated in the agora. An origin for the open space here in the late 4th Ct BC is being postulated, but the main visible layout clearly belongs to the 3rd/2nd Ct BC. The most surprising discovery, was that of a second bouleuterion at its NW corner, with a capacity for about 70 councillors (Fig. 40, top 107</page><page sequence="50">108 R. J. A. WILSON left). Its orchestra was paved in simple white tessellation, and it was entered through a spacious door 2.40m wide on its E side. This bouleuterion dates to about the middle of the 2nd Ct, but why it was replaced by another, larger council chamber to the S only 20 or so years later, is unclear; either the original one was too badly damaged in the first Slave War of 135/32 BC to be worth repairing, or else, more likely, the population of letas was growing as the economy flourished, and a larger council representation (and thus a larger building) was thought necessary. Tiles stamped with magistrates' names (Tammaros, Lakon and Deinias) do not belong to the original roof of the building but represent later repairs. The collapse of this roof took place in the early imperial period, on the basis of a lamp of this date and Italian terra sigillata sealed below. Also of great interest is the discovery of a small rectangular columnar hall on the E side of this older bolileuterion, with columns in the centre on four sides supporting the roof, in the same kind of arrangement as seen in contemporary basilicas in Italy (e.g. at Pompeii). If this is a basilica (rather than a prytaneion, the interpretation suggested by Professor Isler), it is the first example to be found in Sicily, and reflects Italian, perhaps specifically Campanian, influence on Sicily at the time of the late Republic; but the building is probably too small to have served as such. The discovery of a Latin inscription nearby (itself a great rarity in Sicily at this period), recording the activities of a certain Cn. Host[ilius], may provide an explanation for the source of any Italian influence at Monte Iato, and document the building activity of an Italian immigrant in Sicily: perhaps Hostilius was responsible for the Italian-style podium temple, also dated to the late 2nd Ct BC, and another Sicilian rarity at this period, which lies on the W side of the agora. But all this is speculation. In fact there is another strong candidate for identification as the basilica. In the NW corner of the N stoa, a base with approach stair was found, a secondary addition (probably of the 2nd Ct BC; the stoa is 3rd Ct), intepreted as a tribunal for a magistrate. This may indicate that the stoa served as a basilica in the Republican period, as is suggested also at Halaesa (where a Latin inscription mentioning as basilica was found in the stoa: Wilson, Sicily, 48), and is in line with widespread practice in the Gr East. The plaster on the wall adjacent to the tribunal had been scratched with a Gr graffito, awaiting decipherment, as well as with a sketch of a head and of a standing nude woman. A fragment of bronze tablet, perhaps of c. 300 BC, with eleven letters surviving on three lines, looks to be part of an official 'decree' of the type so well known from the Entella tablets. Elsewhere in the agora, in its SE corner, the E stoa has been shown to have only a single nave (by contrast with the double-naved N stoa) and to be 5m deep; its floor is made up of small white limestone pieces. The collapse of its roof seals pottery (ARS) of c. 150/200, by which time letas was in deep decline. In fact the detailed evidence from the excavations shows that different buildings in the agora collapsed at different times, some as late as the 5th Ct AD. The building on the SW side of agora is also under investigation; it appears to have been enlarged in stages after 300 BC. Fragments of an Attic bf amphora with a banquet scene were found in a medieval fill here, as was also part of a Laconian krater, the first occurrence of this ware at Monte Iato. The plan of the HL building here recalls that of an oikos, but its function remains uncertain. Part of a limestone female draped statue was found reused in a late wall near here, and two fragments of marble draped statues are also reported from superficial layers of the agora, pathetic remnants of the figures which once proudly graced Ietas' agora, and which happen to have (just) escaped total oblivion in the early medieval lime-kilns. With the completion of the excavation of the luxury resi- dence next to the Gr temple (AR 1987-88 140, fig. 42), known as 'peristyle house 1', attention has shifted to a quarter further W, where a second peristyle house ('2') has been partly uncovered.. From HL levels at this have come Megarian bowls and lamps of 'Ephesian' type, stamped with the name Heraios (attested at Delos and elsewhere); a fragmentary lion terracotta protome was also found. Only part of the peristyle and three rooms have so far been explored, but the story so far is very similar to that from 'house 1' - opus signinum floors, decorated stucco cornices, a floor collapsed from above, indicating another two-storey dwelling, and a destruction and abandon- ment layer around the mid-1st Ct AD. Nearby an earlier dwelling has been located, possibly abandoned before comple- tion, which at the latest belongs to the first half of 5th Ct BC. The mould for production of a stylish female protome of c. 400/350 BC from here presumably indicates a late C terracotta industry at letas. A small building with white tessellated floor is also currently being excavated at NE corner of 'peristyle house 1'. It is speculated that it might have had a sacral character because of the discovery of a tall-footed lamp (11.5cm high), lance points and a fragment of terracotta altar with a bull being attacked by a lion, as well as a terracotta statuette of a bull. Its date is probably somewhere in the 4th/3rd Ct BC. In addition to all this, yet other peristyle houses have been identified, one S of the agora ('S1'), with a frag- mentary capital of Sicilian Ionic type, remains of dentil decoration in stucco, and rooms with floors in opus spicatum and opus signinuml; and another peristyle house in the E quarter ('El'), with stone architrave bearing astragal decoration. The frequency with which peristyle houses are encountered with every trial trench that is sunk is certainly giving the impression that HL letas was superlatively well endowed with dwellings of style and substance. Meanwhile the publication programme proceeds at an impressive rate. A summary of the present state of knowledge about Monte Iato up to the end of the 1980s can be found most usefully in H.P. Isler, Monte Iato: guida archeologica (Paler- mo: Sellerio, 1991, pp. 100), but inevitably it has already been rendered partly out of date by the researches of the past six years. Of the definitive excavation report monograph series, four substantial volumes have appeared between 1991 and 1994. Studia letina III (by H.-S. Daehn, 1991) deals with the larger bouleuterion and the temple on the W side of the agora; Studia letina IV (by R. Beat Caflisch, also 1991) is an invalu- able catalogue of bg pottery finds between 1971 and 1982; Studia letina V (also 1991) is S. Ritter-Lutz's pioneering study of medieval lead-glazed wares; and finally, the volume likely to be of widest interest, we have K. Dalcher's publication of the architectural aspects and building history of the splendid two-storey 'peristyle house 1' in Studia letina VI (1994). The original house, here dated to c. 300 BC, had 21 rooms and covered 665 m2; additions c. 200 BC, when a bath was installed and a service court added on the west side of the house, brought that to 816 m2. Detailed discussion of other HL peristyle houses is also included. The Monte Iato example emerges as the oldest and one of the largest of such houses known, and indeed Professor Isler has suggested direct influence of Macedonian royal architecture to explain some of its features at such an early date (in W. Hoepfner and G. Brands, eds., Basileia. Die Palist der hellenistischen Kinige [Mainz 1996] 252); but whether such a high dating for the visible main structure, publication of the pottery notwithstand-</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 ing (problems of residuality need to be tackled), will meet with general acceptance remains to be seen (cf. W. von Sydow, RM 91 [19841 245. 313-4 and 350 no. 20; H. Lauter, Die Architek- tilr des Helleiisnsiiis [1986] 142, n. 45; H. Lauter-Bufe, Die Geschichte des Sikeliotische-Korinthischen Kapitells [Mainz 1987] 26, no. 39; R.J.A. Wilson in Henig, ed., op. cit. [above, in the section on Monte Iato's theatre] 75-6). A Vorbericht by B. Hedinger (in Rei cretariae Romanae filltorum acta 29-30 [1991] 81) on the earliest terra sigillata from the site (which includes some pieces of Campanian red gloss ware, formerly called 'Tripolitanian' sigillata, the first to be recognised from W Sicily apart from an unpublished piece at Campanaio), gives us a foretaste of another volume to come in the Studia letina series. Professor Isler has also contributed a note on a loom- weight, found in 1993, inscribed, appropriately, in honour of the Charites, apparently by or for Gerrai(a?), an otherwise unknown Sicilian name; the piece is ascribed tentatively to the 4th Ct BC on the basis of letter forms (ZPE 101 [1994] 104). He has also discussed a dozen inscribed lead or terracotta glandes, all apparently used as sling slot, and dated by Isler to the second half of the 4th Ct BC (Archiiologischer Anzeiger 1994, 239). A picture of Monte Iato before the arrival of Greeks (or Gr influence) has been sketched by him in Studi Tusa (85), and medieval occupation at the site has recently been conveniently summarised by the same tireless author in Montevago e Entella, 105-25, with house plans and selective presentation of the small finds (cf. also E.A. Ribi and H.P. Isler, SicArch xxi.66-68 [1988] 61). Indeed the careful disen- tanglement of the medieval houses which lay above the HL city, particularly in the agora, has revealed not only important details of house-layout for Sicilian medieval archaeology, but also abundant quantities of well-stratified glazed and other pottery, which will help to give greater precision to the dating of 11th and 12th Ct ceramics elsewhere in W Sicily. The other hill-town of W Sicily with an impressive record of full and prompt publication is Entella, 20km S of Monte Iato, where the excavations of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa have continued with undiminished vigour. The results have been rapidly disseminated in a series of immensely detailed interim reports in the Annali of the School (ASNP3 18 [1988] 1469; 20 [1990] 429; 21 [1991] 101; 22 [1992] 617; 24 [1994] 85); these five reports alone total over 600 pages. Vase painting scholars will wish to take stock of the 4th Ct fragment of a Sicilian rf vase showing the comparatively unusual scene of Alcmena on the pyre, separately described by M. De Cesare in ASNP- 22 (1992) 979. In addition there is much of import- ance in Atti Elimi and in the volume Alla ricerca di Entella, edited by G. Nenci (Pisa 1993). The latter, which provides background material to the present excavation campaigns at Entella, rather than reports of that work as such, includes a complete bibliography of res Entellinae up to 1993 (there are 36 items of bibliography for 1992 alone!), and a full listing of references to the site (with Italian translations) in classical texts, epigraphy, coins and medieval documents; the last, by Jeremy Johns, is a particularly useful key to normally inaccess- ible material (61-97). Among other contributions we may note the full publication of the two A tombs excavated in 1979 (157-94), hitherto only briefly reported (G. Falsone, Sic.Arch. xiii.43 [1980] 21), and the exemplary study by M.G. Canzan- ella recording 21 new sites in Entella's territory, found by field survey in an area of some 300 ha in 1986-88, with careful recording of site size and the material recovered, and with discussion of the overall pattern of settlement in the light of the 43 sites now known in its immediate hinterland (197-338). One, in localith Vaccara, at foot of Entella rock on the N side, Fig. 41 is clearly on the basis of surface finds the site of a fully-fled- ged R villa, judging from the presence of black and white tesserae, hypocaust pilae bricks, and a white marble slab from an opus sectile floor; a tile stamped AKQ are among the finds (M.C. Parra, ASNP3 24 [1994] 298). The date range of the villa is apparently between the 1st Ct BC and the 6th Ct AD. In addition to this useful Vorbericht on Entellan history and archaeology, we also have now the handsome first volume of the definitive excavation report (G. Nenci, ed., Entella I, Pisa 1995, pp. 227), which opens with full publication of the HL building (AR 1988-89 143) containing pithoi (Fig. 41), tentatively interpreted as a public granary (M.C. Parra et al., 9-76). It is now known to have been built in the last quarter of the 4th Ct BC and destroyed by fire in the 3rd Ct, probably during the First Punic War. Entella I also contains full publica- tions of selected groups of material - indigenous incised/impressed (C.A. Di Noto, 77-110) and painted pottery (M. Gargini, 111-61), called 'Elymian' by some (but not here); terracotta circular loomweights (A. Bove, 163-8); tile stamps (26 Greek, 16 Latin) (B. Garozzo, 163-87); and medieval pottery (P. Ghizolfi, 189-215). The efficiency of Professor Nenci and his team in publishing all this material with thor- oughness, speed and skill deserves the gratitude and admiration of all who care about Sicilian archaeology: he has set high standards for others to follow. Another crowning success for this project has been the creation of a new Antiquarium to present the finds from the site, not at Entella itself (where security would provide too many headaches) but in the local town of Contessa Entellina; it opened its doors for the first time in 1996 (Archeo xi.7 [July 1996] 16). At Entella itself a stretch of the ancient walled circuit has been located on the W side of the city, made up of large gypsum blocks, and dated to the 6th Ct BC with HL repairs. Adjacent to it is a 12th Ct AD complex with a central court and a ramp up to the second storey, recalling aspects of domestic north African Islamic architecture; it includes the only hamman so far known in Sicily (apart from one in La Zisa at Palermo). The medieval remains uncovered can be conveniently followed in Montevago e Entella (51-66), where there is also a valuable excursus on the medieval pottery (67-93). Plentiful HL material is appearing beneath the medieval layers, but coherent building plans of this earlier date are proving hard to come by. The location of the agora and the principal public buildings mentioned in the Entella decrees, the search for which provided the initial spark for launching fieldwork at Entella, remains as elusive as ever. 109</page><page sequence="52">110 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 42 Outside the inhabited centre, excavation has also been proceeding since 1987 on a flat terrace just below the rock on its SE side. At some stage this had been used as an extra- mural industrial area, as shown by the discovery of a pottery kiln. Its date is uncertain, but it is certainly pre-H and possibly pre-C. Whether it turns out to be the first 'Elymian' pottery kiln ever discovered must await more detailed study of the material; but among the latter were, significantly, wasters of painted pottery of indigenous type. A trench nearby yielded a range of fine wares of 6th/early 5th Ct BC date, including Ionic B2 cups, associated with indigenous geometric painted pottery; below was an LBA layer with high-footed basins of Thapsos-culture type. Later this area was covered by a HL necropolis, of which 44 graves were excavated between 1987 and 1990. All were inhumations, mostly of the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC, with the usual range of types (burials placed in the bare earth; rock-cut tombs with terracotta slab lining and covering; a calppuccinIC type); one, the richest burial, had limestone-slab walling and cover, and contained two Sicilian alabaster alabastra and an rf lekane and skyphoid pyxis decor- ated with female heads. Most of the other pottery consisted of plain wares with a little bg pottery, but metal grave goods were virtually absent. Amphoras included small-scale versions of Graeco-Italic and 'Chiot' types, probably both Sicilian-made. Nearby, three cremation burials and a series of bothroi have also been excavated, with material including lamps and unguentaria of the 2nd/lst Ct BC (R. Guglielmino, in J. de la Geniere, ed., Necropoles et societes antiques (Grcce, Italie, Languedoc) [Cahiers du Centre Jean Berard XVIII], Naples 1994, 203). A Muslim cemetery has also been identified here in superficial layers, of uncertain date between the 9th and 13th Ct (id, Montevago e Entella, 231); another has been excavated at Caliata near Montevago (G. Castellana, ibid. 223). Of other hill-towns in the province of Palermo, one virtually new to archaeology is Polizzi, which lies at a height of 917m in the heart of the Madonie, due S of Cefal. Little archae- ological work has ever been undertaken here, but in 1992 and 1994 over a hundred tombs were excavated in a HL necropolis on the SW side of the city. The oldest burials, which date to the second half of the 4th Ct BC, are inhumation burials, but then the rite changed, and the tombs of the 3rd Ct are all cremations with identical tomb-types to those at Cefali: several epitymbia (on the Sicilian distribution of which see A. Tullio, Akten des XIII Internationalen Kongresses fiir Klassische Archiiologie, Berlin 1988 [Mainz 1990] 429), and tombs with stepped bases, often covered by plaster, and plenty of the more widespread a cappuccina tile-covered graves as well. The main excitement was caused by the discovery of Tomb 4. an 'a cappuccina' burial containing bf pottery (olpe, ovoid skyphos) and three 'Pagenstecher' lekythoi, one with the figure of a dancing woman, another of a swan; but the pi&amp;ec de resistnlce was the principal cinerary urn, an rf amphora showing Heracles and the Nemean lion on one side. and a lady seated at her toilet with an Eros on the other. There are some parallels in style with both bg decoration on pots in Marsala and with the work of the Lipari Painter (for the toilet scene), but it is not clear yet whether this handsome addition to the corpus is an Italiote or a Sicilian rf product; the date is around the middle of the 4th Ct BC (A. Tullio, Poli;. i Generosa. Necropoli ellenistica in conltrada Slun Pietro. Stcuai 1992. Mostra g,f'1tic(L efotogralfica 1-31 (cgosto 1993, pp. 32, off-printed from Inicon- tri e inizititive: memorie del centro di cu(itltura di Cefutlh n.s. vii.l [1990, publ. 1993]). Further S again, right in the heart of Sicily and only just inside Palermo province (in the territory of S. Catarina Villarmosa), lies the spectacular site of Terravecchia di Cuti (961m high), already noted in the pages of AR (1981-82 100: 1987-88 140). Recent work here has concentrated on the settlement rather than the sanctuary; it was occupied from the early 6th to the end of the 5th Ct BC. Just outside the defenc- es, near a drainage channel passing through the wall, was made the intriguing discovery in 1989 of four bronze belts of indigenous workmanship. The most striking one, 36.8cm long and 8.2cm high (Fig. 42), is decorated with three stylised human faces (A. Burgio, BcdA' lxxviii.77 [1993) 47, and is comparable to other examples from Mendolito, from Sabucina, one probably from the Siracusano in Mainz, and a fragment, presumably a Sicilian votive, at Olympia. Of the other three belts, one has decoration in the form of rectangular outlined panels, another fragment has zig-zags; and the fourth is simpler still. The belts are probably status symbols of a warrior elite, but whether they were made to be worn in life or only for the grave or indeed as votive offerings is uncertain. So too is the date: on the analogy of other examples they might be as early as the second half of the 7th Ct, for which period activity at Terravecchia is hitherto otherwise unattested, or else they date to very early in the 6th Ct. Whatever the precise chronology, the anthropomorphic belt in particular is a splendid addition to our limited examples of decorated indigenous bronzeware from Sicily; whether they should be treated as 'Sikel' or 'Sican' (the distribution shows the presence of these belts in both the areas traditionally assigned to each people) is open to debate. Two small areas of the settlement at Terravecchia which were built up against the defences in the SE sector have been</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 111 Fig. 43 r-- Fig. 44 explored, with generally rather small rooms, their floors cut into the bedrock; finds included kitchen pottery and a basalt hand mill. Also found was a large number of 5th Ct BC loom Fig. 45 weights, clear evidence of weaving and (presumably) local sheep raising to provide the necessary wool. Several of the weights are inscribed, with KYIAPA occurring three times (it may be the name of an indigenous deity: cf. on Morgantina above. and ZPE 105 [1995] 261) and XAPI no less than five times; the others are AKKA (twice), ATITA, KYPAI, EINAP- OE (Fig. 43). KYKYOY and XAEYO. The last two are certainly owners' names (the penultimate has also EIMI, 'I belong to Kukuo (?)') and most if not all the others are prob- ably so too (E. Epifanio Vanni et al., Terra in terra, 45). Further to the W, at Montagna dei Cavalli, a stunning mountain top 1()07m high near Prizzi (Fig. 44), excavation by Dr S. Vassallo for the Palermo Soprintendenza since 1988 in this 4()-ha urban settlement have confirmed the mid-4th Ct BC as the general period for rejuvenation of activity on this hill-top. when fundamental restructuring of the town swept aside the earlier A lay-out: there is an almost total absence of 5th Ct BC material, when the site seems to have been deserted. The acropolis is ringed by its own defences, quite independent of the lower defences; whether these are contemporary or (as at Segesta. for example) of differing periods, only further work will elucidate. In 1991 a tower on the NE side of the upper defences, ol rather elongated plan, was uncovered together with a five-roomed building (possibly a barracks) nestling against the N defences here. Nothing appeared to be earlier than the mid-4th Ct BC. Graeco-Italic and Punic amphoras in the abandonment layers of the mid-3rd Ct BC, together with an iron lance and arrow tips, showed that activity here barely lasted a century. Stamped roof tiles bore a ligatured name interpreted as YHAEIOE. Elsewhere on the acropolis, an elon- gated rectangular building of uncertain date (it measures at least 17m by 7.10m) was partly overlain, in about the late 4th Ct BC. by a circular structure (diameter 4.85 m), perhaps a shrine. From the former came an extraordinary gilded silver plaque (Fig. 45). measuring only 1.8 x 1.6cm, and featuring a bearded male. presumably a divinity, whose head is shown simultaneously in frontal view and in both side profiles (the left one is. however, damaged). This tiny votive comes from a destruction layer of the mid-3rd Ct BC, which provides a teiriniu1Is post qiteii non1 for it; but parallels are hard to come by in any context, let alone a Sicilian one, and the excavator offers no suggestions. The style of the head is surely hellenistic rather than archaic, so it is hard to group it with indigenous bronzework of the sort seen at Terravecchia di Cuti (see above): for me it recalls the triple-headed images (in stone and occasionally in pottery) of deities in the Celtic realm, especially</page><page sequence="54">112 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 46 Gaul (cf., e.g., M.J. Green, Dictionary of Celtic myth and legend [London 1992] 114). These, however, are all later than the mid-3rd Ct BC, and the head on the plaque is in any case more naturalistic than Celtic art of that period; so the notion that this might just possibly be the treasured trinket of a Celtic mercenary in Sicily must also be ruled out. For the moment, therefore, this intriguing piece remains quite without parallel. If Montagna dei Cavalli is to be identified with the ancient Hippana, as seems very probable on the basis of medieval records indicating place-name survival (AR 1987-88 142), then presumably there is later occupation to be discovered elsewhere on the rock, for the settlement survived long enough for the 'Ipanenses' to be recorded in Pliny, NH 3.91. Fifteen coins from the acropolis excavations are of types (obv. man-headed bull, barley ear; rev. knuckle-bone) attributed to the mint of Hippana (L. Gandolfo, Atti Elimi /I, forthcoming); inter- estingly, there is also a stray from Campania, from the mint of Suessa Aurunca. The site of the theatre of Montagna dei Cavalli, not so far explored, is clear froml surface features on the N side of the acropolis (it faces N). and there is a visible analemma wall; the diameter of the catlca is 52m (cf. Monte lato's at 68m). A flat space just below the theatre has been tentatively proposed as the site of the agora. Traces of A occupation are still largely witnessed by 7th/6th Ct BC indigenous, impressed pottery below the HL levels. with the few Gr imports not arriving until the second half of the 6th Ct; structures of that date are, however, elusive (S. Vassallo, Gli Elimi, 313; Terra in terra- 116). Nor have other hill-top towns in Palermo province been neglected. Montagnola di Marineo, in the Belice valley, where clandllestini have been allowed to operate unhindered over many years, punctuated only by brief interventions firom the Soprintendenza in the 1970s (BTCGI IX. 365), has now been expropriated by the Soprintendenza, and excavations conducted in 1991 and 1993 by Dr F. Spatafora. This is another hill-top with fortifications (a 15-m. stretch 1.40m wide has been uncovered on the SE side, of HL date, including the position of the S gate), and with early medieval houses (nothing is later than the Norman period) on top of C and HL predecessors, as at Monte lato, Entella, Segesta and elsewhere. Similar too is probably Monte Falcone, a site new to archaeol- ogy; also fortified, there are some traces within the walls of houses with cisterns. Intervention by Dr C. Greco in a necrop- olis between Monte Falcone and Monte Carozza, disturbed by clandestine digging, has uncovered a series of trench tombs or tombs 'a grotticella', mostly of the 5th or early 4th Ct BC, and also some cremations protected by roof-tiles propped up gable- wise ('a cappuccina'). Unusually one amphora burial was itself placed under a tile covering. Also new to archaeology is Cozzo Spolentino near Corleone, 1000m high, and much devastated by the clandestini. This is yet another hill-top occupied in A and then again in HL times, by which time the settlement had become profoundly hellenised, before abandonment and a subsequent further return to the security of the hill in early medieval times. In the SW sector, trial excavation in 1993 by Dr F. Spatafora for the Palermo Soprintendenza located late 5th/4th Ct BC votive material, including statuettes of female divinities and numerous coins. There was also the very rare find (for Sicily) of a rock crystal inscribed with a representa- tion of a winged Horus (Harpocrates), and a little head in faience, also rare in the island. And still the list of urban hill-top sites in Palermo province where recent work has been conducted goes on: their sheer number makes the task of topographical identification with those ancient place-names still unlocated (Manni, Geografila, passim) a daunting, and probably a hopeless, task without documentary clues. At Colle Madore near Lercara Friddi surface examination has found a sandstone block of C (?) date depicting in relief Heracles with his foot on an amphora; a bronze decorated strip and Corinthian, Massaliote and Samian amphora sherds have all been picked up. Excavations were due to commence here in 1995. Other hill-tops to have been investigated through surface sherding are Cozzo S. Angelo and Cozzo Finaite near Marineo (P. Lo Cascio and A. Scarpulla, SicArch xxvi.82 [19931 7), Serra di Puccia in the valley of the upper Fiume Grande, SW of Polizzi (A. Burgio, SicArch xxii.69-70 11989] 61), Cozzo Paparina, in the valley of the Oreto mid-way between Palermo and Monte Jato (S. Tusa et ail., SicArch xxiv.74 [1990] 29) and Pizzo Pipitone near Caccamo, in the hinterland of Termini Imerese (S. Verga, SicArch xxv.80 [19921 67). With the advent of the pax Rominla, many of these remote</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 47 and often virtually inaccessible hill-towns were gradually aban- doned in favour of better-watered and more conveniently situated settlements in or close to the valley bottoms. This is a process clear only in broad outline; detailed field survey, with few exceptions, has yet to demonstrate it in detail, and the picture is in any case likely to vary widely from one part of Sicily to another. Right in the very heart of Sicily, for example, a field-survey of a piece of territory of almost 100 sq km (11 km x 9km) in the region of S. Caterina Villarmosa, carried out in 1977-78 and 1981, has been published in exemplary detail as the first ever Sicilian contribution to the multi-volume Forma Italiae series (S. Vassallo, S. Caterina Villarmosa [Formae Italiae 34], Rome 1990, pp. 128); but the period of densest occupation here in antiquity took place not in R times but during the Gr period: rural sites started to be settled from the beginning of the 6th Ct BC rather than earlier here, given its dis- tance from the main centres of Gr civilisation on the coast. Two dozen sites, including half-a-dozen necropolises, were identified as belonging to the period from the 6th until the mid-3rd Ct BC; by contrast the R period has produced evidence for only four sites, perhaps because the area was given over to large estates then, the latifilndia of the R literary sources. Another extensive systematic survey was that conducted by Dr Jeremy Johns (now of Oxford University) in the 1980s and called the Monreale survey, which was designed to examine a proportion of the estates granted to the monastery of S. Maria at Monreale in the late 12th Ct; preliminary results of this have now been published (J. Johns, Atti Elimi I 407; id., in G. Noye, ed., Structures de I'habitat et occupation du sol dans les pays mediterraneens: les nethodes et I'apport de l'archeologie extensive [Rome and Madrid 1988] 73). An area of 72 sq km was intensively field-walked, a strip of territory 14km x 5km with a small eastern appendix. The fluctuating settlement pattern over time can best be appreciated by a glance at a selection of four of Dr Johns' period maps (he has published 15 in all) in Fig. 46. These show the intensity of rural occupa- tion during the 4th/3rd Ct BC (top left), including the urban centres of Monte Maranfusa (see below) and Monte Pietroso, a situation in marked contrast to the period after the establish- ment of the Roman province, down to c. 0 BC (top right), when the two-hilltops are abandoned, and many of the other sites are given up too (35 sites reduce to 19: more latifundia?). Ten new sites appear in the early Empire (not shown), and most continue in occupation into LR times (bottom left), when settlement is considerably more dense than in the last centuries BC. Significantly, however, as a sign of troubled times, and of worse to come, one of the 'new' sites at this period is a farm planted in the ruins of Monte Maranfusa, in the security of the hill-top; and this desertion of the countryside in favour of more secure dwelling places on the hills, setting a trend which can still be seen in the pattern of hill-towns in Sicily today, becomes starkly clear in the Byzantine and early Arab period (bottom right), although admittedly there are some uncertainties over pottery chronology at this period. One example of an R settlement in this part of Sicily is that at S. Agata di Piana d'Albanesi on the Agrigento-Palermo road 30km S of Palermo, thought by some to be the Pirama of It. Ant. 97.1 (surface sherds cover 4ha), where the excavations of Dr Caterina Greco for the Palermo Soprintendenza have uncovered 246 tombs of a LR cemetery with a wealth of grave goods, including much ARS, African lamps and some fine glassware, as well as local pottery. The date is in the 5th and the early years of the 6th Ct AD, and the excavation is important not only for the detailed information it has yielded on funerary practice at that period, but also for the chronology of the local pottery fabrics (including some simple painted jugs), dated by association with the fine wares (Fig. 47). Many of the tombs were still intact under a tumulus of stones bonded in white mortar, a different manner of drawing attention to a grave than was the norm in Sicilian LR necropolises (which are normally slab-covered or have a semicircular white mortar cap ('a cupa'). Both individual and multiple inhumation was practised. In the latter case the old bones were merely pushed to one side to make way for the new burial, and in these cases the original grave goods were removed, since it is always the offerings accompanying the latest burial which are present. They are placed invariably at the head or shoulder of the deceased, and normally consist of three items, a jug of pottery or glass, a glass beaker, and a lamp, although some have jewellery as well, such as brooches, bracelets and earrings; tomb 5, for example, has a copper alloy buckle, while tomb 40 has two iron brooches and five circular iron rings, perhaps part of a belt. There was no substantial distinction, however, between the grave goods in male and female burials. Of the first 100 graves excavated, 73% were single-burial, of which 84% were adults; male graves outnumbered female by 3:1. Age at death for adults varied between 25 and 55. In two children's graves and four of the young adults there was evidence for nutrient deficiency ('cribra orbitalia': see last paragraph of this Report). The lamps are primarily ARS and Tunisian-made, but there are two Tripolitanian lamps, some from Greece, and one from central Italy. The glass, of which a selection is shown in Fig. 48, is mainly greenish; the 'lamp beaker' is a common form, present elsewhere in LR Sicily (Wilson, Sicily, 271), and there are also cylindrical beakers in bluish glass. (C. Greco, Terra in terra 158; ead., BCASicilia vi-viii.2 [1985-87, publ. 1989] 19). Dr Greco thinks that much of the glass may have been imported, especially from the East, and some of the shapes are certainly paralleled there, but a local manufacture is by no means impossible for the vast majority of these pieces, and the very frequent occurrence of numerous bubbles in the glass ('seeds') caused by heating too slowly the molten glass for blowing does not suggest that this is high-quality imported glassware. Another R site identified in recent years is that in contrada S. Luca, in the territory of Castronuovo di Sicilia, near Portella di S. Francesco on the SS. 188. Here sherds covering some two ha in well-watered land suggested a R farm or village, and excavation in 1992 revealed that the site started in the late Republican period, but that the principal remains uncovered belong to the imperial period (the precise date is still to be established). They include a large apsed room 12.5m long, presumably the dining room in the residential part of a villa (and probably on the basis of its plan not datable before the 113</page><page sequence="56">114 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 48 3rd Ct AD); and in another part of the site part of an enigmatic building, perhaps lst/2nd Ct AD, with three steps leading up to floor level at the W end (Fig. 49). Inside the room below floor level were parallel walls arranged in the shape of a U, 40cm apart. The most likely explanation is these are sleeper walls below the floor of a granary to allow good circulation of air; if so it would only be the second certain rural example of its type identified in Sicily (cf. Wilson, Sicily, 191, cf. 208). A chance find in the immediate vicinity is of a 5th Ct BC coin of Himera, but there is nothing to suggest a C farm on this site. A much smaller R rural site has also been discovered in localita Pagliuzza near Caltavuturo S of Himera, prompted by the chance discovery in October 1989 of a fine Republican silver coin hoard of 541 denarii in mint or near-mint condition, which for once has a secure archaeological context. Excavation near the find-spot uncovered part of a rectangular dry-stone building, including a brick-paved room, of a small establish- ment dating to the late 3rd Ct BC. The site seems to have had a fairly short life, and the excavators suggest that it may have been abandoned as a result of the second Slave War at the end of the 2nd Ct BC. The upheavals then provide the probable reason for the depositing of the hoard, which contains coins from 209/8 BC to 102 BC (E. Mantegna Pancucci, D. Pancucci and S. Vassallo, Terra in terra 138). Few sites of this date (without later R imperial overlay) are known in Sicily, and it is to be hoped that excavation at Pagliuzza will continue to discover more of the building where the hoard was deposited. A summary of present knowledge about R-period sites in Palermo province can be found by S. Vassallo and C. Greco in Atti Elimi 1, 703-22. A short distance N of Pagliuzza is the hill-top town of Monte Riparato, where Dr D. Pancucci has been conducting excavations for many years (AR 1987-88 139). The last campaign in 1989 concentrated on the settlement within the walls, where a paved street with blocks set at 45° to the curb has been uncovered, and five rooms of a house with walls still up to 2m high. Part of the fallen stucco cornice with dentil and astragal decoration lay as it had fallen in one room; iron tools, including hammer and pick, are among other finds. The date is Fig. 49 late hellenistic (2nd/lst Ct BC): Monte Riparato is another hill-town, like Monte Iato, which flourished in the late Repub- lic and then faded in the early Empire (D. Pancucci, Terra in terra 207). Two other hill-towns in Palermo province where work has continued in recent years remain to be mentioned. Monte Maranfusa, where excavation by Dr Francesca Spatafora for the Palermo Soprintendenza started in 1986, is an A settlement of the 6th and early 5th Ct BC (AR 1987-88 143); parts of two simple houses have been excavated, separated by a street. The settlement was abandoned suddenly c. 480 BC, perhaps after a natural disaster, and not occupied again until a 5th Ct AD farm (see above) was built in the ruins, followed by early medieval occupation (on the latter see F. Spatafora, in Monte- vago e Entella, 127). The archaic settlement was rich in pottery, with Attic bf cups and a bf lekythos of poor quality showing a goddess mounting a chariot (attributed to the Group of the Haimon Painter), and Ionic B2 cups (the latter compris- ing some 70% of the imports); but the vast majority of the pottery was indigenous, including both painted and incised wares (Fig. 50), an intact mid-6th Ct pithos, 1.18m high, still standing in one of the rooms, with broad straight and wavy lines painted on it (Fig. 51), and two column kraters with simple subgeometric decoration (one is Fig. 52), native products in clear imitation of imported Gr shapes (Terra in terra 3).The other site is Monte d'Oro di Montalepre, thought by some to be ancient Hykkara (Thuc. 6.62), where excavation</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 115 Fig. 50 Fig. 52 Fig. 51 in the necropolis in 1989 (localita Manico di Quarara) dis- covered 16 artificial rock-cut hypogea ('a grotticella'), pre- ceded by dromoi, and containing multiple inhumation burials. there were some imports, especially Attic, from the mid-6th to early 5th Ct, but most of the material in these tombs was indigenous, with a similar range to that found at Monte Maranfusa. There was a little later frequentation of the necropolis too, with one burial of the second half of the 4th Ct at the entrance to tomb 7, and some of the hypogea also have burials of the 4th/3rd Ct BC deposited on top of the archaic ones (C. Greco, Terra in terra 199). At Monte Castellazzo di Poggioreale, in Trapani province, a Gr commercial amphora scratched with the letters TIAIEM, probably c. 500/450 BC, which was found during excavations here in 1980 (AR 1981-82 104), has been interpreted as the genitive of an otherwise unknown name, perhaps Elymian (A.M.G. Calascibetta, ANSPI 20 [1990] 19), while a group of 6th-4th Ct BC corn mills from the 1976-82 excavations have been examined petrographically and found to use mainly local sedimentary stone from the Belice valley, but two are of basalt from either Etna or the Monti Iblei, and three samples, one as early as 500 BC, are of grey leucite-bearing basalt from the Orvieto region of central Italy (F. Spatafora, Studi Tusa, 165). This material is known to have been widely used in R times for mills (D.P.S. Peacock, World Archaeology 12 [1980] 43), and is known in Sicily from examples in the Palermo museum, and at Solunto and Halaesa (Wilson, Sicily, 240), but this is the first time it has been identified in deposits as early as the A period. We also now have reports on both the Corinthian and a selection of other pottery from this site (A. Fresina and A. Spanb Giamellaro, in Studi Tusa 61 and 159). The most famous of the hill-towns of W Sicily, however, is undoubtedly Segesta, where the activity of the Trapani Soprintendenza under the energetic direction of Dr Rosalia Camerata Scovazzo, in close collaboration for some projects with Professor G. Nenci of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (assisted by the University of Siena), has brought to life a city which, for all the fame of its Greek temple and hellen- istic theatre, has been slumbering for far too long. For a summary of our state of knowledge before the current round of</page><page sequence="58">116 R.J.A. WILSON Fig. 53 Fig. 54 work, see V. Tusa, Segesta (Sellerio: Palermo 1991, pp.112), but already there is much in it that is out-of-date. Some of the recent work can be studied in the 230-page interim report on the 1987-88 seasons in ASNP3 21 (1991) 765-994, which also includes as prolegomena a useful collection of all ancient references to the city and all known epigraphic material. There is also much of relevance to Segesta in the three conference proceedings on the Elymians (Gli Elimi, Atti Elimi I and (forthcoming) II). As part of the new initiative, an archaeologi- cal park at Segesta is at last now being created (R. Camerata Scovazzo, Atti Elima, 139), and a long-needed site museum in the attractive complex of rural buildings known as Case Barbaro is planned (V. Cabianca, ASNP3 21 [1991] 765 and 802). On the lower part of the hill, just inside the upper defences, a rock-cut house with walls over 3m high has been excavated and preserved (Fig. 53). The two main rooms were apparently cut as early as the end of the 6th Ct BC (Ionic cups and indig- enous impressed pottery), but it was incorporated later into a HL dwelling, with a built bread-oven in the corner of one room and a round base, probably a house altar, in another. Important work has also been carried out on the defences, which have at last been securely dated. The outer walls, enclosing a city of c. 55 ha, belong to the first half of the 5th Ct BC; there were some traces of hearths below them belonging to the A city but no real structures of this date, and no sign of A defences anywhere. Particularly impressive is the great N gate (Fig. 54, in the valley not far from the temple car-park ('Porta di Valle'). The various phases (Fig. 55) in this strikingly well- preserved addition to Sicilian defensive architecture have yet to be worked out in detail: to an original double gate were added, probably in the early 4th Ct, a heavy platform for catapults, reflecting developments elsewhere in Sicily of the increased use of artillery at this time: numerous stone catapult balls are among the finds (Fig. 56). By the end of the 4th Ct BC, the whole of the entrance gateway had been blocked and the gate entirely disused; it is clear that by the late HL period Segesta must have shrunk in size, being confined within the upper defences. This upper walled circuit, which enclosed c. 32 ha, has been provided with a terminus post quemn by a HL house which has been excavated at one point below one of the rectangular projecting towers (tower 8) on this circuit; the latter has now been partially restored (Fig. 57). The house is apparently 'late' HL in date, and the defences use HL reused material in their construction, including pieces of column. What 'late hellen- istic' means remains to be clarified: were these walls created at the time of the Slave Wars in the later 2nd Ct BC, as has been proposed for the late circuit at Heraclea Minoa? Or could they be new defences erected as a sign of civic prestige when municipal privileges (doubtless benefiting from traditional blood ties with Italy through its legendary founder, Aeneas: Cic. ii in Verr. 4.33.72) were granted to Segesta during Augustus' reign? Full publication of the dating evidence is eagerly awaited. So too are further details of a possible third</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 55 Fig. 57 Z,. Fi,. 56 ., 'intermediate' set of defences. of which a short stretch has been identified recently. situated between the known inner and outer circuits. Within these walls little survives, it seems, of the 5th-Ct-BC city, the Segesta of Thuc. 6.46.3, and even less of the archaic city (the statuIs lquCestiolnis for the latter is conveniently summarised by J. de la Geniere, ASNP' 18 [1988] 287, which is principally an account, with full presentation of the material, of her important sonlatges at Segesta in the 1970s: AR 1981-82 105): but many further details are emerging of the HL city after its major restructuring in the 3rd Ct BC (possibly encouraged by its grant as one of only five Sicilian civlitates liberae et immunes: Cic. ii in Verr. 3.6.13). It was certainly then, if not before, that Segesta received its regular grid-plan of streets, notwithstanding the rocky terrain. A house in the hitherto unexplored S sector, near to the S 'acropolis', has been partially investigated: it has been dubbed the 'Casa del Navarca' ('House of the Naval Captain') because of the unusual discovery in the collapsed debris of three limestone consoles, each a little under a metre long, which are shaped in the form of ships' prows: two of them are currently (1996) on show in the Venice exhibition (Western Greeks, 636, no. 2). Their purpose is unclear, but the square base surmounted on top of each suggests that they may have served as statue bases. The clear naval allusion has given rise to the theory that this was the house of the Segestan naval captain Heracleus (or Heraclius). mentioned in the pages of Cicero's Verrines (ii in Verr. 5.43.111; 45.120), who died c. 73/71 BC. Only one major room (the 'tablinum') and smaller rooms opening off it have so tar been excavated, so the plan of the house, which appears to date from the second half of the 2nd Ct BC, is not clear; but an air of comfort is also suggested by a mosaic threshold, the tesserae of which, largely robbed, probably formed a rholmboid pattern. In the saddle below the N acropolis, in the former upper car-park. the agora of Segesta has been discovered, with a stoa and other buildings along its N side (Fig. 58). As at Monte Iato the remains are largely of the 3rd/2nd Ct BC; again as at Monte lato, they have been badly damaged by medieval occupation. A Ist-Ct-AD inscription from the agora indicates continuing life in the city then, but recent work has confirmed an earlier hypothesis (R.J.A. Wilson, Koktlos 22-23 11976-77] 694) that Segesta had largely ceased to exist in the 2nd Ct AD, occupation being coniined to a few scattered pockets of non-urban activity: an olive oil processing plant, for example, with press base and collection basin, was installed on the south side of the now-blocked N gate, the Porta di Valle, apparently in the Hadrianic period (Fig. 59). Further decline in civic life is indicated by LR tombs inside the city area: some burials of the 5th Ct AD have been found behind the Santa Barbara church, and others in the area of the Casa della Navarca. Also 117</page><page sequence="60">118 R. J. A. WILSON Fig. 58 probably of LR date is one of two kilns located by archaeo- magnetic means (the other near the theatre is of c. 50 BC/50 AD): the different mean directions of the stable linear compo- nents of magnetisation of the two kilns also point to their different chronologies (P. Marton et al., Science and Technol- ogy for the Cultural heritage 1 [1992] 123). In the 12th Ct Segesta was refounded, and much has been learned of the early medieval city from the recent excavations, especially those of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. The results can be followed in ASNP', and more concisely in Federico II, 187-98; this work has embraced the castle on the N acropolis (which has obliterated all trace of the earlier temple assumed to lie at this highest point of Segesta), as well as the church of Santa Barbara to the N of it and a small mosque to the S; the latter is the first to have been excavated in Sicily. In earlier layers below the church of 1442 was found an intriguing fragment of mosaic, recording that 'Dionysios the son of Heracleides, an Alexandrian, made (this mosaic)', the first epigraphic witness to the presence of a Alexandrian in Sicily (apart from a linen-merchant at Palermo in AD 602: CIL X.7330). The date is early in the 3rd Ct BC (ASNP3 21 [19911 916). To the W of the Santa Barbara church, a medieval house has been excavated, with rooms partly cut in the rock. In the fill of the terracing wall supporting the house was found native pottery (including a basin with vertically mounted handles on the rim) dating to the end of the 6th Ct BC, at the time of the first terracing of the city area; there was later a large structure of HL date on the site, probably a house, but possibly a public building; and finally came the early medieval superimpositions. The prehistory of W Sicily is too large and complex a topic to enter into here, but advances have been made on many fronts. Human bone assemblages from the cave sites of Isnello (Late Copper Age/EBA) and Scillata, of uncertain date, both in Palermo province, have been examined and found to be both secondary depositions (minimum of six and seven individuals respectively), the former being without their skulls (M.J. Becker, SicArch xxv.78-9 [1992] 103). Among other prehistoric research in Palermo province we may note the publication of a cave in the Conca d'Oro called Grotta delle Volpi, used by probably shepherds at the end of the 3rd millennium and the beginning of the 2nd; it has yielded sherds of the Piano-Quar- tara, Malpasso and Castelluccio cultures (G. Mannino, SicArch xxv.80 [1992] 59). In the territory of Partanna, the energetic activity of Dr Sebastiano Tusa has led to the discovery and exploration of many important prehistoric sites. The importance of this zone for Sicilian and indeed Mediterranean prehistory can be Fig. 59 followed in Dr Tusa's prolific writings, especially in his Preistoria del Basso Belice, already cited (Tusa, Belice) and also in three books, S. Tusa, Partanna nella preistoria dell'area mediterranea (Palermo 1989); id., La preistoria nel territorio di Trapani (Syracuse and Palermo 1990); and id. and M. Pacci, La collezione dei vasi preistorici di Partanna e Naro: ceramiche dell'alntica etdt del bronzo nella Sicilia centro-occidentale (Palermo 1990, pp. 220). Among many key sites, we may mention Grotta del Cavallo near Castellamare del Golfo, where a deposit of much N and Copper Age pottery was discovered; and Roccazzo, near Mazara del Vallo (AR 1987-88 144), important for the fresh light they have shed on a Sicilian Copper Age settlement (as opposed to merely burials: S. Tusa, Origini 14 [1988-89] 101), which belongs to the S. Cono/Piano Notaro/Conca d'Oro culture. At Motya there has been renewed excavation in Area K (Dr G. Falsone and A. Span6 Giammellaro), on the walls (Pro- fessor A. Ciasca) and in the residential quarter (Dr M. Fama), while the museum has been re-opened after substantial reorganisation. The superb marble statue now holds pride of place here (having been transferred from Marsala Museum, where I reported it in AR 1987-88 149), and should lure more visitors to this lovely isle who might otherwise have omitted it from their itinerary. As predicted in my last report, the statue continues to fuel debate and speculation. Among recent views are those of the late Sandro Stucchi, who considered that it represents Daedalus and is a Selinuntine work taken to Mozia</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 after 409 (Rendiconti Pontificia Accademia 59 [1987] 3); A. M. Precopi Lombardo, who wonders whether it represents the tyrant Gelon 'disarmed' (SicArch xxii.71 [1989] 73); Fulvio Canciani, who reckons it a charioteer and Attic work of c. 470, placed as an ex-voto in Mozia by a visiting Sicilian tyrant (H. Froning, T. H1lscher and H. Mielsch, eds., Kotinos. Festschrift fiir E. Simo1n [Mainz 1992] 172): N. Bode, who sees it as a heroic rendering of the Carthaginian general Hamilcar (Antike Kutnst 36 [19931 103); and the theory of S. Sande, who suggests that the youth is a dancer or actor plundered from a Greek city by the Carthaginians in 406/5; Sande thinks that the sculptor was West Greek but not Pythagoras of Rhegion, since its creation is assigned by him to the third quarter of the 5th Ct (Acta ad Archaeologian et aritilum Historiclam pertinentica n.s. 8 119921 35). For a useful round-up of all the multifarious views which have been expressed on the Mozia youth, see now A. Span6 Giammellaro, SicArch xxiii.72 (1990) 19-37, and especially A. Di Vita in Stile severo 73-8 (and cf. also G. Garbini and V. Tusa, SicArch xxi.66-68 [1988] 11 and 15); but still the debate goes on. A new monograph, for example, by C.O. Pavese, L'aturiga di Mozia (Rome: L'Erma di Bretschnei- der, pp. 77) was published in 1996, but at the time of writing a copy has not yet reached me. The Motya charioteer (for that is surely what he is, in accordance with majority opinion) was found adjacent to a potters' quarter on the N side of the island (Area K). In 1994 the important excavations of this potters' workshop (AR 1981- 82 102: 1988-89 149) continued under the direction of Dr G. Falsone and Dr A. Span6 Giammellaro for the Trapani Soprint- endenza and the Istituto di Archeologia, Palermo (for a report on the 1981 excavation, cf. G. Falsone, SicArch xxii.71 [1989] 51: and for the 1985 season, see A. Span6 Giammellaro, SicArch xxii.69-70 [19891 39, when the finds included a rare example in a Sicilian context of a fragmentary proto-Aeolic capital, probably of c. 550/ 450 BC, on which see ead., Atti 11 ConIgresso Internazlionale di Stlldi Fenici e Pullici [Rome 1991 1 1161). The area already excavated (SicArch xxiii.72 [19901 29) was extended to the N and the E. and a large yard identified with an entrance on the SW. At the rear of this, along the back of the city wall, three rooms had been built, each opening onto the yard and not inter-connecting. The first had a clay-working pit and unbaked pottery pieces in it, the second contained lots of unfired amphoras, and the third and largest room, clearly the main workshop, had further evidence for amphora production, including long sheets of unbaked clay ready for the potters' wheel. The amphoras being made here were of the standard Punic cylindrical amphora-type of the 5th Ct BC with shoulder handles. A semicircular clay-lined vat was a built feature of this room, the floor of which is inclined to one side for ease of drainage. A large water-worn boulder originally set in mortar was interpreted as the base for a potter's wheel. In the debris of this room were found two terracotta female protomai and the hand in white marble of an archaic kore-type statue. Outside this room, in the court, a staircase went up to either a first floor or the flat roof of this workshop. A row of amphora wasters stood in a rack in the centre of the yard. In the SE corner was a large square tower c. 6m across, incorporating in its structure a kiln: this is S of the line of fortifications and may have been an emergency defensive tower built during the siege of Motya in 397. Sling stones, hundreds of bronze arrow heads and iron lance tips were found in the debris of the workshop marking the final assault of that year, after which the whole area was sealed by a tip of pebbles. Dr M. Fama's 1980s work in Area A near the centre of the island (AR 1987-88 149), revealed that the earliest nucleus of the 'house of the amphoras', three rooms at the NE corner of the excavation, seems to have been built in the 7th Ct on the basis of pottery fragments, prompting a re-examination of all the evidence for 7th-Ct activity at Motya (M.L. Fama, SicArch xxiii.72 [1990] 13; ead., Atti II Congresso Internacionale di Studi Fenici e Punici [Rome 1991] 831). On aspects of Motya's archaeological topography, Professor A. Ciasca (University of Rome) has summarised her current thinking, in the light of her most recent excavations of the four phases she has identified for the walls of Motya: they date between the 6th Ct BC and 397 BC (Lixuis [Coll.EFR 166], Rome 1992, 79; ead., Studi TLusa 27); the first two-phases use a mud-brick superstructure on a stone base. For her thoughts on Motya's necropolises, cf. ead., SicArch xxiii.72 [1990] 7, and she is also one of the authors of a useful guidebook to Mozia in the new Ministero per i Beni Culturali Nazionali series (A. Ciasca et al., Moziai [Rome: Istituto Poligrafico dello Stato] 1989, pp. 131), which serves as a useful introduction to the archaeology of this fascinating isle. More in the coffeetable genre is the handsome volume with all-colour illustrations by V. Tusa et cal., Mozia. Crocevia della comIlniciazione niel Mediterracneo (Palermo: SIP, 1990), pp. 120. M.G. Griffo Alabiso has re-examined the famous causeway linking Motya to the mainland, built probably c. 600/550, and shown that the original hypothesis that it was built to link the island to an early necropolis at Birgi has been discounted by more recent work, which shows that Birgi itself had a consider- able settlement to which the necropolis belonged. Rather the causeway demonstrates the willingness of the Motyans to have as easy an access as possible to its natural hinterland on the mainland opposite, especially for vehicular traffic, rather than be confined to its island base (SicArch xxiv.76-77 [1991] 77). Among other publications of the older material, we may note inter alia the translation into Italian of Joseph Whitaker's classic of 1921, making available again to a new generation of readers a book which has always been scarce (J.I.S. Whitaker, Moczia, una colonial fnicia in Sicilia [Quaderni di BCASicilia 13] Palermo 1991, pp. 439, with an appendix dealing with correspondence concerning the launch of Isserlin's excavations, and with an introduction by L. Bernabb Brea). Dr G. Falsone has challenged the traditional view that the Phoenician settlers removed an indigenous population on the island: the prehistoric material from Motya goes not go down beyond the LBA, and what had been thought to be 8th-Ct indigenous wares is more likely to be locally-made plain pottery, since it does not occur on contemporary indigenous ('Elymian') sites (G. Falsone, Institute of Archaeology Bulletin 25 [1988] 31). Dr Falsone has also published an ovoid betyl found by Whitaker in the tophet in 1920, an iconographical rarity in a Sicilian context (although there is a close parallel from Pantelleria), and not particularly common either in the stelai series in Sardinia or north Africa; it may be related to the worship of Baal Hammon in his all- -embracing cosmic guise (G. Falsone, Journal of Mediterra- nean studies 3 [1993] 245). We may also note A. Ciasca and M.P. Toti's Scavi a Mozia: le terracotte figllrate (Rome 1994, pp. 87 plus 43 plates), which publishes a full catalogue of the nearly 300 crude terracotta small-scale votives found during excavation of the tophet ; almost all are likely to be Sicilian made, most if not all of them local. They extend in date from the beginning of the 7th to the end of the 5th Ct BC. Another recent publication is S. Moscati's Le officine di Mozia [Atti Accademia naz.ionale dei Lincei, Memorie ser. ix, vol. VII. I] (Rome 1995), pp. 126, who considers once again the well- known massive series of stelai from the island (1,334 have been registered), and attempts to identify individual workshops 119</page><page sequence="62">120 R. J. A. WILSON and sculptors on the basis of style and iconography: the book is dedicated to 'The Master of the Boy God, an unknown Mozia craftsman'. Moscati emphasises the originality and distinctiveness of the Motya series, which broke free from dependence on the Carthage repertoire and remained largely unaffected by Greek influence (for other studies of aspects of the Motya stelai, cf. also C. Del Vais, SicArch xxvi.81 [1993] 51 and D. Artizzu, ibid. 75). At Marsala further work at the residential quarter at Capo Boeo, where excavation has been occurring spasmodically for over fifty years, has yielded a substantial monumental building. constructed in excellent-quality isodomic masonry, perhaps public rather than private in character; it was excavated by Dr I. Valenti in 1988. The building was floored in the late 3rd Ct with mosaics with floral and vegetal motifs; one pavement is apparently close in style to a floor at Piazza Armerina. A damaged marble portrait bust was found in one pit here: from another came a mid-imperial amphora still containing substan- tial remains of garum and esauro fish. In the necropolis a further tract has been explored, by Dr Giglio for the Trapani Soprintendenza, this time along Corso Gramsci. Here burials of imperial date reusing Punic shaft- and chamber-tombs have been found, a phenomenon already widely attested at Marsala. Most spectacular here was the discovery in 1994 of a well- preserved painted hypogeum (also a reused Punic tomb), provided with three arcosolia perhaps in the 3rd Ct AD. Three burials were still in situ, although the skeletons were poorly preserved. One is presumably that of a lady called Salvia Prisca, as we know from the painted inscription on one of the arcosolia. The frescoes, which show a banqueting scene, a dance and peacocks and a basket (kalathos), as well as roses and other flowers, represents a major new addition to our hitherto paltry knowledge of Roman painting in the island. Elsewhere at Marsala a new small catacomb to add to that long known (Lilibeo [1984] 19), has been explored by Dr Bonacasa Carna of Palermo University: it also reused a Punic hypogeum. The 1987 excavation of a portion of the necropolis in via Sturza/via Cattaneo (AR 1987-88 148) has been fully published by B. Bechtold (SicArch xxvi.81 11993] 31). Meanwhile, in the museum courtyard, a circular Punic kiln 1.95m in diameter associated predominantly with jugs of the 4th/3rd Ct BC, and with a dolilum in the workshop outside the kiln, has been excavated by the Trapani Soprintendenza (B. Bechtold and I. Valenti. SicArch xxiii.72 11990] 39). A second kiln is also reported nearby, but details are sketchy. In the Stagnone off Marsala, between Capo Boeo and the Torre S. Teodoro, a chance find fiom the sea in 1994 at a depth of 3-4m, 100m from the shore, was a small hoard of HL gold jewellery (Marsala Museum, inv. 3360-3369). It com- prised a man's gold ring, the stone missing from its oval setting; a gold bracelet with ovolo and palmette decoration on the edges; a fragmentary gold chain with a ring at one end; a miniature lion's head in gold with two attachment rings; a pair of gold disc suspension earrings with a tiny cupid head in the centre of each; another pair of earrings clearly from the same workshop, also with circular discs but with a flower at the centre and pendent cupids attached to the underside; a tiny loop earring with a cupid surmounted by an 8-petalled flower; and two lion-head terminals with a double hook applied to the mouth. The date is thought to be somewhere in the 3rd Ct BC. In view of the comparative rarity of finds of HL gold jewellery in Sicily, this is a welcome addition to the slender corpus of material. Among other publications, we may note especially the useful summary, copiously illustrated, of the present state of knowl- edge about the pre-R city by C.A. Di Stefano, Lilibeo pIlnica (Marsala: Centro socio-culturale "Luigi Sturzo", 1993, pp. 62. with 53 pl. and 44 pp. of figs.); what is essentially a summary of this can be found in a guide book in the Italian state's 'Itinerari' series (no. 12), by the same author and with the same title: ecld.. Lilibeo Pimica (Rome: Istituto Poligrafico dello Stato, 1993, pp. 73). F. D'Angelo, one of the leading medieval pottery experts in Sicily, has helpfully published the medieval and post-medieval pottery on display in the Marsala museum, which stretches from the c. 105( to the 17th Ct (SicArch xxiii.72 11990] 51; and cf. I. Valenti. Archeologia medievale 16 11989] 613 for an excavation of medieval levels in Vico Infermeria in the town). Further SE, in the hinterland of Mazara del Vallo, at a spot named Timpone Rasta (contrada Mirabile). part of a late Republican and early imperial farm (c. 150 BC onwards) was partially excavated in 1988. apparently belonging to a building measuring c. 70 x 42m, with ranges of lrooms set around all four sides of a peristyle 28m x 26.5 m: but only the E and S sides were established with certainty. and the reconstructed plan remains hypothetical. A simple tessellated floor in blue and white in the E corridor, and a fluted column together with a stucco cornice in the E wing suggest the comIfoirtably-appoin- ted part of the villa. A stairwell indicates that the building had a upper storey. at least in part; the walls had a bottom course of tufo blocks on a pebble foundation, and a mud-brick sup- erstructure above. The building was destroyed by fire at an uncertain date; a rubbish deposit over the ruins contained pottery of c. 150/80 AD. It was about then that the E wing was put back into use, probably for animal pens: there is pottery in this area up to c. 450/500 AD. Survey work in the immediate hinterland has identified the sites of seven small farms. 8 large ones and 9 'villas' (i.e. sites displaying tesserae or at least some architectural feature), the vast majority of 3rd/2nd Ct BC origin. The smaller sites had been abandoned by the early Empire, but most of the others continue, and increase in size then, until abandonment in the mid-5th Ct, perhaps the result of Vandal incursions (see above on Sant'Anna and Campan- aio). Four sites continue into the 7th Ct AD (E. Fentress, D. Kennet and I. Valenti. Opus 5 11986, publ. 19901 75). More recently, 200m from the Timpone Rasta farm. an early medieval site has been identified from surface evidence and partly excavated. by Dr I. Valenti for the Trapani Soprintend- enza: the walls discovered were dated to the 11th Ct. but with earlier levels below, which inter calia yielded a gold Byz coin of the 7th Ct AD. This site (Casale Nuovo) is probably a small Byz and early medieval rural village, but there is so far nothing to suggest a direct continuity of occupation between the R and the Byz sites. On the island of Pantelleria, F. Cantarelli has assembled a list of places with surface indications of archaeological interest (without, however, being aware of the important fieldwork of Professor D.P.S. Peacock and his recognition of the island as a source of widely exported cooking ware in the R period: id. and M. Fulford, Excavations at Carthage. The British Mission. 1.2 [Sheffield 1984] 8 and 157); she also claims to recognise. in the modern field and track patterns of a densely cultivated plain, a survival of Roman limitatio, of which three squares of 700m a side (20 actus'), and three of 700 x 350m (20 actus x 10) (in Studi di storia antica in llmemoria di Clemlentina Gatti [Milan 1987] 47). If right, this would be first example of its kind in Sicily; but the area is too small for certainty either way, and claims of this type often bedevil studies of Roman centuriation (cf. O.A.W. Dilke, The Roman land survevors [Newton Abbot 1971] 139, 191).</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 Fig. 60 Also in the Trapanese, at Erbe Bianche in the comune of Campobello di Mazara, excavations by Dr M.L. Fama have uncovered the post-holes of a circular hut with hearth and a beaten earth floor belonging to an LBA Thapsos-culture vil- lage, a western manifestation of this culture whose presence is becoming increasingly recognised in W Sicily (Tusa, Preistor- ia, 530, fig. 50 for a plan). A few metres away is a small Gr cemetery of c. 500 BC, with 'a cappuccina' tombs and others rock-cut (R. Camerata Scovazzo, in Tusa, Belice 16). This is probably a small rural necropolis in the Selinuntine chora of a type which in Sicily is all too little known; the potential for the study of such rural cemeteries has been amply shown by J.C. Carter's work in the Metapontine chora (cf. most recently id., in J.-P. Descoeudres, ed., Greek colonists and native popula- tions [Oxford 1990] 430). At Selinus there has at last been created a vast archae- ological park (cf. also T. D'Amato, SicArch xxiv.75 [1991] 31), embracing the acropolis, the Manuzza hill and the Eastern temples: cars are banned (elderly visitors may, alas, now think twice about visiting the acropolis on foot from the entrance to the park at the Eastern temples), but what is particularly regrettable and controversial is the creation of a vast (and presumably costly) earth barrier 4m high on the E perimeter of the park. This shuts completely from view, until the visitor is inside the park, the three Eastern temples, whose architects built them to be seen from afar, and whose view from afar created such an impression on the early travellers. On the Manuzza plateau N of the acropolis, an E-W street has been found, of the same width as the great N-S artery of the main street grid. The agora of the archaic city is suspected at the junction between these two arteries, making a trapezoidal space of similar shape to the agora of Selinus' mother city, Megara Hyblaea; excavation at this point has recently com- menced. A major clearance operation in the area N of the acropolis' N gate has revealed a good example of a Gr-type bridge (i.e. before the invention of the voussoir arch: Fig. 60), as well as very many columns and reused blocks taken from the hastily assembled 4th- and 3rd-Ct fortifications. Some of the pieces, which presumably come from so far unexcavated buildings on the adjacent Manuzza hill, include some A pieces which look contemporary with the Temple of Apollo at Syra- cuse, and are certainly earlier than the mid-6th Ct. An interest- ing jig-saw puzzle is emerging, with some buildings reconst- ructable on paper. Once again the impression is created of a great megalopolis with an impressive early temple-building programme unrivalled, as far as we know, anywhere in Sicily apart from at Syracuse. Also among the new finds was a Fig. 61 fragment of a small A metope, found built into a modern house in 1988. What survives suggests a male bearded figure with head to right, holding or wrestling with an animal, perhaps a stag, at the end of his outstretched arms. Perhaps the struggle between Apollo and Heracles over possession of the Ceryneian hind is what is intended. Whether it belongs to the early series of archaic metopes already known ('Temple Y', etc.), or to some other building, is as yet unclear. On the line of the A defences on the E side of the town (AR 1987-88 145), the E gate has been discovered and excavated (Fig. 61). Dating to the first half of the 6th Ct, it consists of a double gate (twin passageway), with gate sockets still in situ, and was defended by a large projecting semicircular tower to the N of the gate, and a rectangular projecting tower to the S. This is the biggest example of a defensive gateway of this date yet found in the whole of S. Italy, in keeping with the grand concept and layout of the city at this time; it constitutes a major addition to our knowledge of Sicilian urban defences (Antike Welt 23 [1992] 313). This represents only the latest phase of Dr Mertens' long years of research on the defences of Selinus, which he has presented with customary thoroughness and lucidity in Mitteilungen des DAI, Riihnische Abteilung 96 (1989), 87-154 (cf. also BCASicilia vi-vii.2 [1985-87, publ. 1989] 53; and Akten des XIII Internationalen Kongesses fiur Klassische Archiiologie, Berlin 1988 [Mainz 1990] 475): inter alia he has discussed the enigmatic rampart on the Manuzza hill, and shown that the N defences of the acropolis ultimately go back to the late 6th Ct. Meanwhile, work on the long-known monuments has continued unabated. The metopes of Temple E, for example, which is now widely accepted as a temple of Hera, have received exhaustive and lavish treatment from the pen of C. Marconi in Selinunte, le nmetope dell'Heraion (Panini editori, Modena 1994, pp. 355). As well as providing full analyses of the four well-known metopes (and a fifth more damaged) on display in the Museo archeologico regionale at Palermo, together with the copious minor fragments, the author offers bold speculation on the arrangement and subject matter of the 121</page><page sequence="64">122 R. J. A. WILSON seven further lost metopes (Iris and Salmoneus; Rhea and Kronos; and the frenzied daughters of Proteus are suggested for the W end; Apollo and Daphne; Poseidon and Amphitrite; Ares and Aphrodite; Peleus and Thetis; and Atalanta and Meleager for the E). Although based on minimal evidence, except that the suggested programme makes coherent iconographical and thematic sense, this fresh slant on a well-known temple will doubtless give much food for thought (cf. also in brief, id., RendPontAccad. 61 [1988-89] 55; Stile severo 81). Among work on earlier discoveries at Selinus, we may note E. 0stby's perceptive discussion of chronological problems concerning the A temple-building programme: he postulates, on the basis of otherwise homeless architectural terracottas of the first half of the 6th Ct BC, the existence on the acropolis of a timber forerunner of that date to Temple C; and despite various attempts to date the stone Temple C before 550, including the desperate theory that the original metopes were recarved, to explain the otherwise 'late' treatment of the drapery (R. Ross Holloway, AJA 75 [1971] 435), he sensibly favours a more traditional date for this temple in the third quarter of the 6th Ct (Fischer-Hansen, Sicily, 83). He has also demonstrated for the first time (ibid. 96) the contemporaneity of Temple D and the peribolos wall; and since the latter is dated precisely to the 490s by Attic sherds in its foundations (Kokalos 36-37 [1980- -81] 1010), earlier dates for Temple D, which is usually placed around 530 (e.g. G. Gruben, Die Tempel der Griechen [1986] 279), stand in need of revision. Dr A. Siracusano has published a terracotta male head, 13.5cm high, found NE of temple C in 1970, possibly part of its architectural decoration; it is dated around 540 BC, and reckoned to be a product of a Selinuntine coroplast working under Corinthian influence (QuadMess 3 [1988] 43). B.A. Barletta has published some disiecta membra apparently from Selinus which have ended up in Malibu, and so added to the corpus of Ionic architectural pieces known from the city (in Studia varia from the J. Paul Getty Museum Volume I [Malibu 1993] 55). Some of the thousands of finds from the Malophoros sanctuary are also receiving publication: in this connection we may note M. Dewailly, Les statuettes aux parures du sanctuaire de la Malophoros ai Selinonte [Cahiers du Centre Jean Berard 17] (Naples 1992), pp. 172, and the imminent C. Dehl-von Kaenel, Die archaische Keramik aus dem Malophoros-Heiligtutnl in Selinunt (Berlin, forthcoming: I owe this reference to Dr F. De Angelis). There are also several papers on Selinuntine material, unsurprisingly, in Studi Tusa: J. de la Geniere on a calyx crater attributed to the Lentini group, of c. 350/20 BC (41), M. Fourmont on a bronze mould for making a figurine, from the acropolis and datable a little before 580 BC (57), G. Gullini summarising twenty years of work on the temples of the eastern hill (73), D. Mertens on the 5th Ct building programme at Selinus (131), and M. Sguaitam- atti arguing for the identification of 'Temple M' as a temple, rejecting an attempt (by C. Masseria, in Annali...Perugia n.s. xvi [1978-79] 63) to turn it into a fountain (151). Nor must I omit the excellent publication by A. Peschlow Bindokat, Die Steinbriicke von Selinunt. Die Cave di Cusa und die Cave di Barone (Mainz 1990), pp. 65, a definitive account of these fascinating quarries, of importance for both Selinuntine studies and Greek construction methods in general (cf. discussion by R.J.A. Wilson, Classical Review 43 [1993] 374). On the epigraphic front A. L6pez Jimeno and J.M. Nieto Ibanez (in ZPE 73 [1988] 119) have restored the name Eukles (in the genitive) to a damaged line of a 6th Ct BC defixio, where a reading was not attempted in the editio princeps (A. Brugnone, Studi .. . . oferti dagli allievi a Eugenio Manni [1976] 119; SEG XXVI, 1113). We also have now in mono- graph form the full publication of a mid-Sth Ct BC lead tablet, acquired by the Getty Museum at Malibu in 1981 and presum- ably found in the sanctuary of Zeus Melichios at Selinus. It names as chief protecting deities, apart from Zeus Melichios, a certain Zeus Eumenes (an epithet hitherto unattested), the Eumenides, and traditional ancestral deities known by the name of Tritopatores; we are also given, fascinatingly, details of the methods of purification through sacrifice and other rites (M.H. Jameson, D.R. Jordan and R.D. Kotansky (eds.), A lex sacra from Selinous [Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monographs 11], Duke 1993, pp. 171). It is also good to know that, after several false dawns, when others look set to publish them, at least part of the Selinuntine necropolises will soon be the subject of detailed studies. It is sad to report that an estimated 80,000/100,000 were sacked by clandestini without record in the 1950s and early 1960s; a further 5,000 were excavated by Professor V. Tusa thereafter (A. Adriani et al., Odeon e altri monumenti archeologici [Palermo 1971] 175), but apart from 900 vases which went to the Mormino collection in the Banco di Sicilia in Palermo, published by J. de la Geniere in CVA Italia 50 (Rome 1971), and in part republished in F. Giudice and S. and V. Tusa, La collezione archeologica del Banco di Sicilia (Palermo 1992), a work cited above (see Introduction), the necropolises have remained essentially unpublished. Now two Swiss scholars, A. Kusterman-Graf and D. Leibundgut-Weiland, of the Institute of Archaeology at Zirich, are seeing through to completion the first systematic account of two of the Selinuntine necropolises (cf. H.P. Isler, in J. de la Geniere, ed., Necropoles et societes antiques (Grece, Italie, Languedoc) [Cahiers du Centre Jean Berard XVIII], Naples 1994, 165). The volume due to appear soon concerns 221 burials from the Gaggera necropolis, which lies NW of the Malophoros sanctuary and just E of the Manicalunga cemetery: 60 of them belong to the first half of the 6th Ct, and the rest to the 5th Ct BC (for a foretaste of the feast to come, the detailed listings given in A. Kusterman-Graf, ASNP' 21 [1991] 101 whet the appetite for more). The other study will deal with 563 tombs and 520 sporadic objects in the Timpone Nero sector of the Manicalunga necropolis, dating from c. 525 and 400 (see in brief D. Leibundgut-Weiland, in KLinst und Klltur in der Magna Graecia . . . Symposiumn Miinchenglldbach 1988 [Tibingen 1990] 71). A comparison between the two cemeteries is instructive. 10% of burials at Gaggera were without grave-goods, and the proportion was higher still at Timpone Nero; they clearly represent burials of the poorest classes (not all Selinuntines were rich). Gaggera has evidence for complex cremation rites, whereas at Timpone Nero many burials were laid straight in the bare earth. Grave goods at the latter, when they were present, were almost exclusively local plain wares; Gaggera had by contrast most of the imports (Corinthian, Attic, Laconian). The potential of all this, not least for the rest of the Selinun- tine necropolises, in its ability to yield valuable information on social stratification and cemetery organisation, is clearly enormous. One must nevertheless deeply regret that, because skeletal material was not kept from the excavations, an oppor- tunity to win even greater demographic information from these burials has been irretrievably lost. But at least a new leaf has been turned, and a new standard set, by the late 4th/early 3rd Ct burials excavated on Manuzza in 1982-84 (cf. also the recent results from the Palermo and S. Agata necropolises, noted above). Although the sample is tiny (only 12 inhumations of both sexes, including children, were submitted for skeletal examination), the results are fascinating. The deceased were aged between 4 and 55 years, with a mean age</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1988-95 123 at death for adults of 42 years; the average height of the men was 1.69 m; the children and two young adults had signs of 'cribra orbitalia' (holes and furrows in the eye sockets), denot- ing lack of iron and therefore nutrient deficiency in their diet; and three of the adults had died from violent blows to the head (R. Di Salvo, BCASicilia ix-x.3 [1988-89] 98). The potential for the future of Sicilian necropolis studies is just waiting to be unleashed. R. J. A.
