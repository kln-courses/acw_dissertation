Again on March 2 some digging was done by, and on March 7 the hole was at least visited by, a Red-belly that presumably was the same bird. On March 18 the hole was worked upon by the migrant male Flicker that was present March 7-18. On April 11 it was worked on by still another male Flicker which that day took up this part of the handed one's now deserted winter range, and on May 1 both a male and a female Flicker, and on May 2 the female again, did some digging. On these May days, though, the Flickers were much bothered by Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and they abandoned the place. Finally, on May 5, a pair of Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythroce- phalus) attempted to work at the hole; these, too, were continually- attacked by the Starlings, and gave up on the same day. The Starlings had begun frequenting the tree on April 7, and the hole itself by April 10. By April 20 they had taken in some nest material, and they added to this occasionally through May 5. However, in this instance they were defeated by their own pugnacity: their attacks had prevented the woodpeckers from dig- ging the hole to a usable depth, and after a while they abandoned it themselves. Feeding. Through March 31 the banded Flicker came frequently to my feeder for suet, and often ate lengthily, yet this by no means weaned him from natural foods. On one day, for example, after spending 10 minutes at the suet he went directly to a wood and began foraging and was still so engaged 40 minutes later when I had to stop watching. Because such statements as I can find about the winter feeding of Flickers emphasize their hunting over the ground or their dependence on fruits and seeds, it seems worth mentioning that besides doing some searching of the ground-where in another winter I once found a male Flicker pounding acorns to pieces-my bird spent considerable time in trees seeking insects. I several times saw him peck lengthily at particular spots on branches as if digging for prey, and once clearly saw him excavate at the base of a dead branch just as a Downy Woodpecker might have done. At other times he picked here and there at branches he was moving over, also in the manner of a Downy, chipped bits of bark off both live an-d dead stems, peered under the projecting edges of large white oak (Quercus alba) bark scales, and searched through piles of dead leaves that had collected in forks. Such heaps of trash probably hold hibernating insects, for I once saw the Flicker swallow after probing in one, and I have on other occasions seen a Flicker and Downy Woodpeckers search them. The leaf nests of gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) are searched similarly by Starlings.-Hervey Brackbill, 2620 Poplar Drive, Bal- timore 7, Maryland. Roseate Tern Nesting in Nova Scotia.--During June and early July of 1956, while banding terns in the Tusket Islands, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, we visited six islands which supported mixed colonies of Common and Arctic Terns. On only one island, shown on the British Admiralty chart as Little Bald, but known locally as Mossy Bald, we also found a very small group of Roseate Terns and were able to band one Roseate chick. In an article which appeared in the January-February, 1956 issue of Audubon Magazine, Dr. Harrison Lewis reported that Roseates were seen occasionally along the south shore of Nova Scotia, but that there was no current record of a breeding colony. We are glad to be able to report that Roseates are still among the breeding birds of Nova Scotia.-David and Marie Henry, 64 Hoitt Road, Belmont 78, Massachusetts.

The 2,717 birds of 19 species banded by "a little under 20" cooperators in New Zealand this year is lower than the previous year's total, but brings the grand total up to 21,360, from whiich 1,273 recoveries have been received to date. Most rewardng have been the results from banding Gannets (MorUs serrator), which breed in New Zealand and winter westward to Australia. One bird traveled some 1,700 miles across the Tasman Sea within 8 days; the long-distance record is a young bird recovered on the west coast of Australia almost 4,000 miles awav 8 months after banding. An unusual recovery was the band from a young Black-backed Gull (Larus dominicanus) found 17 months after banding inside a fish caught near by. This year for the first time some 350 petrels and shearwaters were banded at sea from fishing boats in Cook Strait; it would be interesting to know how they catch these birds for banding. The New Zealand program is finding its bands do not last on the birds as long as they should. Those on Gannets returning to one rookery "had to be replaced after only three to five years on the birds."- 0. L. Austin, Jr. 4.

(Die Altershezeichnung von Ringvogeln.) l955. Gerhard Zink. Die Vogelwarte, 18(1): 1-5. German bird banders are required to distinguish between unfledged and fledged birds. A further separation is not always possible, but highly desirable. The designation "young (juv.)" is to be avoided and should be replaced by "bird of the year" or "bird of the precedina year." The term "old" may be supplemented by com- ments such as: not bird of the preceding year, at least second hreeding plumage, etc. When possible separate breeding birds, i.e. "local" from migranlts. Zink warns banders to be accurate and urges them to report on physiological condition, age, development, etc., in as much detail as possible to enhance the value of their banding records.--Frances Hamerstrom. MIGEtATION ( See also Numbers 54, 55) 7. Meteorological Variables and the Northward Movement of Noc- turnal Land Bird Migrants. Gilbert S. Raynor. 1956. Suk, 73(2): 153-175, In this very interesting pbaper the author, a meteorologist, ladvances the hypothesis that "nocturnal migrants find flight easier through stable air than through turbulent air, that stable conditions are of major importance in triggering such flights, and that a positive relationship exists between atmospheric stability and nocturnal migrations." Etaynor examined 2,500 reports of migrants and plotted their probable flight paths on maps showing areas of stable and unstable air, wind direction and speed at 2,000 feet, and surface weather conditions classified as favorable, unfavorable, or intermediate. From the analysis of these maps he concludes that spring migration normally takes place with favorable winds in stable air and that migratory flights are often terminated at the edge of an area of unstable air or unfavorable winds. Raynor's arguments are logical and very convincing, but few readers will accept the statistics with which he tries to prove his case. He submits his classification of the erobable paths of the mig;rants' flights to statistical analysis and concludes that the results are "highly significant" in favor of his hypothesis. Yet he admits that the classification which he is analyzing statistically "is depend- ent for accuracy on my judgment of how great a distance was travelled by each flight." Such procedures weaken an otherwise valid interpretation of observed phenomena. William H. Allen. 8. Compass Directional Training of Western Meadowlarks (Sturnelln neglecta). Ursula von Saint-Paul. l956. Auk, 73(2): 203-210. This paper reports on an experiment in which five hand-reared Western Meladlowlarks were trained to seek food in a given direction. Training was given at the same time each day. The training method used eliminated all visible directional clues other than the sun. After 20 days of training each bird was tested when the sun's position differed from that in the training period, to determine whether the bird would choose a direction based on a constant angle with the sun or select correctly the true direction used in training. (The use of the term "com- pass direction" in this paper is confusing; it is apparently intended as a synonym for "true direction.") BThen the sun was visible two birds were able to select the true direction within 90 degrees, one tended to maintain a constant angle with the sun, and tests on two were inconclusive.

The author seelns justified in stating "The results of this</page><page sequence="4">44] Recent Literature Jaruary study give further support to the supposition that the ability of true azimuth orientation, where the sun's azimuth position and time of day are the necessary requirements, is general among birds." However, her statement that "the sun is treated [by birds] in a peculiar manner which is the product of an elaborate evolutionary process" needs further clarification and substantiation.-William H.

From 34,443 Mediterranean Gulls banded at Orlov in Russia between 1930-1952 there have been 627 (1.7%o) recoveries. A study of these shows the main migratory movements of the species. The gulls travel and winter in homogeneous groups. Most of them migrate west and southwest, a small contingent southwards and another minor group to the Caucasian coasts of the Black Sea. Their chief wintering areas are the Mediterranean coasts of southern Italy, Tunisia, Greece, France, and Spain. During their westward journey the gulls traverse great land masses, plains, and mountains. The most easterly point reached is the Azov Sea, the most northerly and westerly the Baltic and North Seas as well as the French and Portuguese Atlantic seaboards. Only vagrant and straying individuals, appar- ently, attain the last three seashores.-Louise de K. Lawrence. 10. Concerning White Stork Migration from Syria through Egypt.

A comprehensive summary of flock counts, move- ments, and band records of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) in the Near East. Fall migration is over a rather narrow migration route and of short duration. Spring migration, on the other hand, has been reported over a broad front and of long duration. Schiiz believes that as far as breeding adults are concerned, spring migrants travel with as much dispatch as in fall, but that this is masked by observations on hordes of immature storks and a few sick hangers-on. Par- ticularly late migrants may have a weak mligratory urge and be uncertain of the route.-Frances Hamerstrom. 11. Delayed Emigration of Certain Birds in Autumn 1954. J. A. G. Barnes. 1956. British Birds, 49(2): 74-79; (4): 167-171. Details are given on late occurrence of summer visitors and passage migrants. Two factors seemed to have contributed to this situation: "a hold-up of departures owing to the lack of favourable weather for migration, and a high rate of survival of lingering birds because of the absence of early frosts and consequent abundance, for the time of year, of insect food."-M. M. Nice. 12. The Migrant Loons of Western Pennsylvania. F. W. Preston. 1956. Auk, 73(2): 235-251.

Bird Study, 3(2): 119-132. Analysis of the extensive data from B. T. 0. nest record cards of Anthus pratensis shows this species starts to lay 3.8 days later in the north of Great Britain than in the south at sea level, and 1 day later for each 130 feet rise in altitude. The mean clutch size of 4.3 eggs decreases from 4.52 near sea level to 4.07 over 1,000 feet, apparently reflecting the more severe climatic conditions at higher altitudes. Breeding success averages 43 percent, and is significantly higher as altitude increases, believed to be due to a decrease in nest predation, particularly by cuckoos, at higher altitudes. Analysis of banding recoveries shows the species' first year mortality after fledging to be 76 percent, and average adult mortality 57 percent. The latter figure is corroborated by the 58 percent average adult mortality obtained from a larger sample of "recaptures" (returns in our usage).</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 3Xli Recent Literature [45 These are intriguing analyses and, as far as I can see from the material presented, the mathematics are correct and the conclusions sound and logical. However, the author fails to point out or to explain one manifest discrepancy, the fact that the rate of recruitment does not balance the annual adult mortality, which it must if a species is to maintain itself. With an annual adult mortality of 57 percent, of each 100 pairs (200 birds) that start a breeding season 114 die before the start of the next one. To maintain the population, therefore, each 100 pairs must fledge enough young so that 114 will survive to start the next breeding season. As this species rears two broods which average 4.3 eggs per clutch with 43 percent success, each 100 pairs fledges 370 young annually, of which 76 percent or 281 die during the. ensuing year. This leaves only 89 young, or slightly less than 80 percent of the 114 needed to maintain the popula- tion. Therefore Great Britain's Meadow Pipit population must be declining at the rate of about 20 percent per year, Q. E. D. Let us assume, in the absence of any other evidence to the contrary, that the Meadow Pipit is holding its own in Great Britain-as indeed we trust it is. Then, unless the demonstrated annual loss is being made up by immigrants from abroad (heaven help us, no!), something must be wrong with the figures. I respectfully suggest that the discrepancy most probably lies in the observed fledging success of 43 percent. If all the other figures are valid, and we have no reason to question them, fledging success must be slightly better than 55 percent to produce the required annual recruitment. I submit, then, that it may well be 55 percent in all unobserved nests, and the discrepancy of 12 percent is a measure of the nest mortality induced by the visits of the observers to the nests they watched, unwittingly and unintentionally of course, by thereby exposing the nests to easier discovery by crows, gulls, cuckoos, and other natural predators. The only way to prove or disprove the validity of my contention, I fear, is by observing the unobserved nests, which could be done only by enlisting the aid of the pixies and the leprechauns.-O. L. Austin, Jr. 14. The Annual Mortality of the Blue Tit in different Parts of its Range. D. E. Snow. 1956. British birds, 49(5): 174-177. Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) can be distinguished in their first breeding season from older birds by their wing-coverts. The author examined over 1,000 museum specimens from all parts of the range and decided that "the mortality of juveniles is higher than that of adults in October and November, but from December onwards juvenile and adult mortality are about equal." From 320 specimens in the breeding season the author calculated percentages of "adults" and first year birds from Britain, but only 40 to 59 from the other regions. No mention is made as to any difference in number of broods attempted in the different regions. An inverse correlation was found between the percentage of old birds and clutch size: Britain-30% adults, 11.6 eggs; Northern Europe-35%, 9.9 eggs; North Africa-42%, 7.5 eggs; Iberian peninsula-55%, 6 eggs; Canary Islands-55%, 4.3 eggs. "Thus Blue Tits can either breed slowly and live longer, or breed faster and die sooner. It is suggested that the control lies, ultimately, not in the mortality factors themselves, but in the number of young which they can produce annually in the area in which they live." One wishes that this sugges- tion had been discussed more fully.-M. M. Nice. NIDIFICATION AND REPRODUCTION (See also Numbers 13, 14, 31, 36, 45) 15. Observations of a Nesting Colony of American Brant. Thomas W. Barry. 1956. Auk, 73(2): 193-202. The author presents a record of his obser- vations of the Southhampton Island (Hudson Bay) colony of Branta bernicla hrota. In 1953, 700 nesting pairs and 400 yearlings visited the island. Previous records are of 2 nests (1934) and eleven nests (1936). It is not known whether the present size of the colony is due to growth or the removal of another colony to this island. The brant colony is located on the mass of small, low islands lying in the 2-mile-wide delta of the Boas River. It is separate from areas occupied by Blue and Snow geese which nest inland on the island. The brant arrived on June 8 and appeared to be mated on arrival. One possible courtship display was noted. Apparently no birds arrived after June 13. The first egg</page><page sequence="6">46] Recent Literature Bird-Banding was found on June 16. Incubation required 23-25 days. Seventeen nests had a total of 75 eggs (av. 4.41). From these 75 eggs, 52 young left the nests. The remainder failed because of various natural causes (sterility, predation, desertion, etc.). Principal predators appear to be Herring Gulls. The arctic fox vacates the wet lowlands when the thaw begins. Polar bears were observed in the colony but they seemed to cause no disturbance and did not molest the birds or nests. Local eskimos prefer to eat the Blue and Snow geese and as a result largely ignore the brant colony. I disagree slightly with Barry's statements along these lines: " . . . the brant congregated . . . to await favorable condi- tions." "Because they had grown accustomed to me . . . . " . . . they took a strong liking to the Equisetum there . . . "-J. C. Dickinson, Jr. 16. A note on the Determinative of the Number of Eggs in a Clutch in the Laro-Limicolae.

Paludan's theory that the degeneration of the "emergency" follicles in the ovaries of some species is governed by the tactile stimulus on the brood- patch of the first eggs laid in a clutch, the author cites and discusses three cases in which apparent proof of this theory exists. A black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) was found incubating three eggs with a fourth fresh egg, judged by its form and pattern evidently laid by the same female, lying cold 16 cm. from the nest. A Common Tern (Sterna hiruundo) was similarly incubating three eggs while a fourth, exactly like the three first ones, lay in the grass 30 cm. away. A Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) incubated a second clutch of three eggs while a fourth lay where the female nested the year before and a fifth was found a metre farther on balancing precariously on a piece of rock. The two outside eggs were fresh and cold, and resembled in detail the three in the nest. Moreover, they were strikingly alike to the clutch laid by the same female the previous year in the same spot. In neither case was there any indica- tion of more than one female being involved.-Louise de K. Lawrence. 17. Studies of the Life History of the Pink-billed Weaver in the Lower Senegal Valley. II.

This paper presents the results of studies in 1955 of two nesting colonies and the reproductive behavior of birds kept in an aviary. In 1955 the rains began a month earlier than usual and were heavier than normal. The weavers adapted their reproduc- tive rhythm to the abnormal conditions remarkably. The increased abundance of insects and vegetable foods was believed to be the chief cause of a second nesting cycle which started about 6 weeks after the first one ended. Six stages of nest construction were recognized: (1) the bridge, (2) the ring, (3) the nest with double openings, (4) the pocket, (5) the covered nest lacking the pent-house only, and (6) the finished nest. The male built the nest, weaving with the bill, the feet playing a lesser role in this work. A whole colony of nests was built in about a week. The larger colony attracted the birds of smaller neighbouring colonies which abandoned their own homes to join the larger community. One tree selected at random contained 65 nests. The nests were constructed before pair-formation. In the defence of the nest intimidation displays consisted of (1) gaping, (2) "ballooning," wings lifted over the back, tail either elevated or depressed. It was directed against both males and females that visited the nest site. Real fighting, occasionally to the death, often followed these displays. In nuptial displays the birds adopted a horizontal posture, wings lightly opened and vibrating, feathers sleeked, tail sometimes spread. The males displayed before their nests to attract the female, who sometimes but not always responded with similar poses and movements. In some cases the female took the initiative. Pair-formation biegan at the end of nest construction, intensified rapidly and finally ended in a "frenzy of copula- tion." At one colony the time elapsed between the first nuptial display and the start of egg-laying was 2 days. Egg-laying often started before the nest was completed and quite often the urgency to lay caused females to drop their eggs an the ground.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. xxvIII Recent Literature [47 1957~~~~~~~~~~~4 The clutch consisted of from one to six eggs. The mean clutch size during the rainy year 1955 was significantly larger than in drier years. While the higher fertility may in part also have been due to the improved food situation resulting from an actual decline in the weaver population that year, the abundance of food produced by the favorable climatic conditions must be considered the major factor. Territorial behavior in Quelea quelea was reduced to defence of the nest itself by the male during construction and by both sexes after pair-formation. Aggres- siveness continued intense during incubation but weakened after the young hatched. The incubation period was 12 days. Both sexes brooded in the daytime and the female was on the nest at night. Nestlife lasted 16 days. The nesting success was greater in nests containing one or two eggs than in those with three or four. It was greater in the favorable nesting season of 1955 than in the previous years. The mean weight of the young was also higher in that year. Experiments with increased daylight advanced sexual maturity in the birds and their molting cycle. This is an important and careful study based on extensive observation of the birds in the field as well as in captivity, combined with apt experiments. The only criticism this reviewer might make is that a fuller picture on the attentivity during incubation and nest-life would have been desirable. Some life-history students would undoubtedly like to know more about the extremely brief periods of actual sitting and the sharing of duties between the parents in a manner that seems peculiar to the species. Good photographs and drawings illustrate the article.--Louise de K. Lawrence. 18. The Number of Eggs Laid by the Cuckoo. (Eizahl des Kuckucks.) 1955. Gerd Diesselhorst. Die Vogelwelt, 76(2): 53-58. Diesselhorst suggests that accounts of high numbers of eggs laid by cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) stem largely from egg collectors who may have stimulated this apparently indeterminate layer to further laying. His 17-year nesting study at Fiirstenfeldbruck (912 nests of host species in all, and one to three female cuckoos annually) leads him to believe that the local cuckoos laid at most six eggs apiece. He adds that the hypothesis that the cuckoo is stimulated to further laying by the sight of suitable nests needs testing.-Frances Hamerstrom. 19.

Comparisons have been made over the same years of Swifts breeding at Oltingen in Switzerland and Oxford in England, Oxford being about 800 km northwest of Oltingen and having a cooler and wetter summer. 2. On the average, laying starts 5 days earlier at Oltingen than Oxford, but the interval has varied in different years owing to the weather. 3. The average clutch is highest in the 3rd week of May, declines markedly in the last week of May and still more in June. Among clutches laid between the same dates, those at Oltingen have been little if any larger than those at Oxford. 4. All the young from broods of 3 have been raised successfully at Oltingen except in the occasional bad summer, but at Oxford only in the occasional fine summer. Each 100 pairs raises on the average 50 more young each year at Oltingen than Oxford.-R. 0. Bender. 20. Observations on the Tawny Owl. (Beobachtungen am Waldkauz (Strix aluco).)

Der Ornithologische Beobachter, 53 (2): 28-35. The author reviews the distribution of the Raven in Bern Canton and reports that it is becoming more common as a nesting bird. He then reports on several incidents in which an adult bird apparently carried water in its throat to give to the young. Water was secured about 10 m below the nest. In other cases, food was immersed in water before being presented to the young. The frequency of this behavior diminished as the young grew older and ceased when they were approximately 30 days old. In warm weather, water was carried more often. In this area, the Ravens did not use the same nesting site more than once. (The nests were situated in cliffs.) Of 15 young observed, at least five died during or shortly after the nesting period, one after 7 and another after 16 months.

A Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nest near Davos, Switzerland, was located in a rocky cliff 20 m in height at an altitude of 1890 m in an area rich in game. The smaller of the two young was found dead at the foot of the cliff a few days after the nest was discovered. The remaining young wvas successfully raised. Periodically the old birds brought fresh tree branches to the nest. Principal food appeared to be the marmot.

A Survey of the Habit of Nest-Appropriation. N. L. Roberts. 1955. Emu, 55(2): 110-126; (3): 173-184. The author presents a broad, general account of the well-known habit of certain birds to use the nests of other species instead of building their own, a phenomenon as yet imperfectly understood despite a voluminous literature. Australian sources, both published and unpub- lished, yield references to its occurrence in 80 species of Australian birds. Con- sultation of standard sources and correspondence with other observers throughout the world show the habit to occur practically wherever birds have been studied. Most widely demonstrated, perhaps, by certain birds of prey, it is indulged in more or less frequently by a wide range of other groups as well. It varies in degree from the few species that always appropriate other birds' nests and never build one of their own, to infrequent, isolated cases of it in many species that normally build their own nests. "A study of these records does not reveal any single or simple explanation of the habit of nest-appropriation . . . the habit . . . cannot be explained on any phylogenetic basis, for it has arisen independently in a number of widely-different groups, which build very diverse structures." Nor is the author convinced that the modern behaviorists' generally accepted explanation of "imprinting" answers the problem adequately. "How for example, can it account for the long list of single records?" A thought- provoking discussion of a subject that promises ample reward for further intelli- gent investigation and study.-O. L. Austin, Jr.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. XXVIII Recent Literature [49 1957 4 25. Bird/Wasp Nesting Associations. K. A. Hindwood. 1955. Emu, 55(4): 263-274. This discussion of the tendency of certain species of birds to nest in association with such aggressive social insects as ants, bees, and wasps was prompted by the discovery that several small Australian bushwarblers and finches do so rather frequently. A survey of the literature and correspondence with observers abroad shows the practice to be world wide, but restricted chiefly to the tropics where such insects are more prevalent. The birds that do so are usually small ones, "largely species of inoffensive habits," and often communal nesters; many show a tendency to nest in trees or shrubs bearing thorns or spiny leaves, and most of them build covered or roofed nests. The evidence shows that in all such associations "the birds seek out the wasps' nests, not the wasps the birds' nests," the insects "tolerate the presence of the birds, yet show little or no forbearance towards human or other intruders," and "it does not seem that the wasps benefit in any way from the presence of the birds." The author believes the birds nest near the insects because of their "desire to be safeguarded from either mammals, reptiles or predatory birds." He suggests that the predisposition of both birds and insects to nest in the same trees and shrubs may have brought on the habit through proximity, but "the absence of any evidence that the habit has risen spontaneously . . . [indicates] a long period of evolution. Possibly the same point obtains in such remarkable prac. tices as egg-parasitism and anting."-O. L. Austin, Jr. BEHAVIOR (See also Numbers 17, 21, 22, 24, 45, 52, 53) 26. Observations on the Voice and Some Displays of Certain Pigeons. Derek Goodwin. 1956. Avicultural Magazine, 62(1, 2): 17-33; 62-70. Based on observations on 10 species of Columba and Streptopelia in freedom and cap- tivity, and illustrated with many sketches, this paper is a significant contribution to the study of comparative behavior. "Display-plumage . . . occurs most commonly on the neck and upper breast. . . . These areas are always exhibited -by inflating the neck and erecting the display-plumage-in the bowing-display." "Parading" indicates sexual readiness. This behavior is combined with "Wing- lifting" in Stock and Rock Doves (Columba oenas and livia), but not in those species under consideration that lack signal markings on the wings. As to the "display-flight," its function is "to advertise the presence of a bird in reproductive condition." It is strongy attractive to unpaired females and to lost and tired birds. "It sometimes seems . . . that in C. livia, as in man, lost or bewildered individuals have a tendency to follow any of their species who shows a self- assured and determined manner. Such behavior would be useful to them since it would ensure that, sooner or later, they would be led to an adequate feeding ground." "Defensive-threat display" is shown by half-feathered nestlings and injured adults; the erection of feathers and wing indicates a conflict situation. "Voice" is discussed under 4 "basic calls"-advertising-coo, display-coo, distress-call, and excitement-call. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of phylogeny. -M. M. Nice. 27.

A collection of remarkable photographs in color of birds anting. Mr. Ivor has seen more birds ant than anybody else in the world. In his observatory he has "watched upwards of 30 species of birds ant and seen thousands of individual antings." He describes the techniques of various species and discusses some of the theories advanced to explain this behavior. He finds it "puzzling that some birds ant frequently and others do so rarely. In nearly 18 years of observation, for example, I have seen the evening grosbeak and the cedar waxwing ant only once. In many ways it seems that anting is a primal form of behavior, lost by some birds but retained by others." The puzzle remains unsolved.-M. M. Nice. 30. Population Changes and Roosting Time of Starlings. David E. Davis. 1955. Ecology, 36(3): 423-430. Roosting time of flocks of Sturnus vulgaris was noted at Baltimore, Md., on 281 dates from Dec. 19, 1950, to May 14, 1955. "The birds roosted about half an hour before sunset from November to March, at sunset in April, and almost an hour before sunset in July." Numbers of birds were highest in September, decreased in November, increased in January, and dropped to a low in June. This pattern was followed all three winters, but fewer birds were present in 1952-53. An extensive bibliography is appended.- M. M. Nice. 31. Communal Life of the Black Kite.

The Black Kite (Milvus migrans), which is ordinarily a solitary nester as far north as Germany, has developed colonies in particularly favorable locations near Frankfurt, one with 5 to 7 nests since 1950 and the other with 19 nests in 1955. Langelott suspects that the abundance !of dead and sick fish has caused the nesting range of the Black Kite to spread up the Main River in the last two decades. Behavior notes of interest are: use of a joint flight play area, and use of joint roosts-up to 18 kites in a single roost tree, and the largest roost with 50 individuals sitting in close formations.-Frances Hamerstrom. 32.

Urs Glutz von Blotzheim. 1956. Der Ornithologische Beo- bachter, 53(2): 36-40. Nutcrackers (Nutcifraga caryocatactes) are well known for their habit of storing nuts for use during the winter. The author observed Nut- crackers transporting nuts from an open northern-exposure mixed woodland to cache them in a thick southern-exposure spruce woods at least 2-4 km away across the Rh-one valley. Several visits to the Aletschwald on the northern-exposure slope between December 31 and June 8 produced only three individual Nutcrackers and very few holes in the snow (50 cm to 1 m deep) characteristic of those made by Nutcrackers recovering their hoarded stores. The author suggests that the birds transported their winter food supplies to the southern exposure for greater ease in recovery during the winter. He says that, in the light of present knowledge</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 5XVIII Recent Literature [51 of Swiss Nutcrackers, this behavior seems to be exceptional and further studies will be required to determine whether it represents a phenomenon attendant to a pronounced place attachment or results from a learning process by this particular population. In Sweden these birds stay permanently within a limited area and are presumed to use their familiarity with the area in finding the storehouses under deep snow. The author also discusses the possibility that the few birds found in the Aletschwvald during the winter were birds of the year, not too familiar with their territories, because the absence of shells or husks around the holes they had dug in the snow indicated that they apparently did not uncover caches of nuts. He also discusses the behavior of these birds in removing seeds from cones. This is a very interesting paper.-R. 0. Bender. CONSERVATION 34. Predation and Protection at Dungeness Bird Reserve. H. E.

This long-awaited work brings up to date the earlier edition under the authorship of Ford, Sanborn, and Coursen. The addition of further sources of information, supplemeniting records of actual specimens in museums and private collections, greatly increases the value of the work as an expression of regional bird life. These sources are the records of local bird clubs, bird-banders, and particularly the quantitative field notes for Lincoln Park that William Dreuth kept meticu- lously for years. This is a concession to the elevated plane sight records have achieved in the present era of excellent field guides and optical equipment, even though it is still recognized that records based on actual specimens must be considered more concrete. Among added features is a better system of estimating relative abundance of species at each locality, pin-pointed by county. A few users observe that the additional information makes it more difficult to find arrival and departure dates than in the old edition, but this is not a serious fault and was unavoidable. It appears that no effort was spared to make the list as useful as possible. It is a fitting tribute to the devotion of Ed Ford, an inspiring friend of my early days.-William J. Beecher. 36. Dynamics of Range Expansion of Cattle Egrets in Florida. 1956. Dale W. Rice. Auk, 73(2): 259-266. The author reports his observations of Bulbulcus i. ibis in a rookery on the campus of the University of Florida. The species first appeared in the mixed heron, ibis, water turkey rookery in 1954. This represented a 180-mile northward extension of its previously known breeding occurrence. Several individuals were seen in the pre-nesting period. The total population at the close of the breeding season was 12; 10 individuals appeared in 1955. Observations were terminated prior to the conclusion of this breeding season. The source of these birds is reasonably assumed to the Lake Okeechobee region of Florida, where the species is presently flourishing. Rice discounts random wandering of adults as an explanation for the establishment of the new colony. On the basis of his observations establishment of the colony by wandering juvenals does not seem likely. The author concludes that the Cattle Egrets became mixed with local herons on their wintering grounds in southern Florida and accompanied them when they returned north to breed. Rice suggests that the successful establishment of the species in Florida is directly related to the</page><page sequence="12">52 ] Recent Literature Janruary expansion of the cattle industry in the state. The successful establishment of the Gainesville colony with an initial introduction of only seven individuals is explained as resulting from interspecific reactions to social stimuli. The author proposes that, if other species had not been present, a minimum of 10 pairs would have been necessary for success. This latter conclusion appears to be based upon an account of the species in South Africa where it is reported to nest in colonies containing from 10 to 2,000 nests. The habit of associating with other species of herons is thus proposed as having survival value in facilitating dispersal and establishment.-J. C. Dickinson, Jr. 37.

Proof of nesting of the Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) found 19 June 1955 at Lake Kelbia in the discovery of 4 adults and 18 ducklings. This was apparently two broods 1 and 3 weeks of age, as indicated by three collected birds. On 14 July about 20 Ruffs (Philomachus pugnax) were encountered in the same locality. One of the birds which was collected proved to be a young of the year in very fresh plumage. Although this find may not be considered certain evidence of nesting, the presence of this juvenile nearly a month and a half earlier than the fall migration of the species begins on this latitude is worthy of notice. Numerous other birds seen at the same time, such as Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), Curlews (Numenius arquata), Black-tailed Godwits (Limosa limosa), were pre- sumably all non-breeding individuals.-Louise de K.

The author secured permission to conduct his first bird count on this protected island in 1950. The data of his 1955 survey are based on meticulous methods of counting and observation, described in detail and well worthy of note by anyone interested in similar research. Comparison of the results of the two counts brought out many interesting changes. The Gannet (Sula bassana) increase of 550 percent was due partly, it is thought, to the immigration to the island of birds hatched elsewhere, but the increases in Shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus), 58 percent in each, might well have developed from the previously existing populations. The Great Black-backed Gull (Larus marinus) population remained stationary, but 100 pairs of Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) were present in 1955 where none were seen in 1950. Most advanced in their nesting cycle at the time of the census (April 11-15) were the Gannets with most pairs already incubating. The Laridae were just establishing themselves on their territories and preyed exten- sively on the eggs of the Gannets and Shags, while the Alcidae were not yet present in full numbers. One Bridled Guillemot (Uria aalge intermedia) was observed.-Louise de K. Lawrence. 40. Notes on the Birdlife in the Jura Mountains. (Notes d'Ornithologie Jurassienne.)

On the basis of experiments showing increases in testicular weights and tubular diameters in response to 15-hour daily photoperiods, the authors con- clude that the refractory period in male White-Crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelliJ reaches its termination in the vicinity of Pullmann, Wash- ington durinv the last 2 weeks in October and the first week in November. Sotne individual variation was noted. No essential differences were observed between the reaction of first-year and adult birds.

Laurence Irving and John Krog. 1956. Physiological Zoology, 29(3): 195-305. Nest temperatures recorded during incubation in seven species of birds at Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska (lat. 68°19' N.) are within the same ranges as those for similar species in temperate climates. "The embrzTos develop in essentially a homoiothermous state maintained hy the vs-ell-regulated behavior of their parents during incubation.... the temperature maintained in nests by parental behavior does not vary in relation to weather and is not visibly related to climate." This continues through the nestling period while "the young birds warm from the temperature of incubation to approach adult body temperature when they leave the nest. Growth proceeds at temperaturss which are actually more stable than in the bodies of adult birds." Though the nestling stage in Fringillids appears to be about 10 percent shorter in high latitudes than in temperate regions, "It !has not been shown that brooding temperature affects the shortened arctic period of nestling life. In comparison with the circumstances of growth in temperate regions, prolonvation of jarctic daylight or daily feeding is much greater than the reported shortening of arctic nest life." The authors conclude "The stable, warm temperature for early avian development is common to all climates, and it is maintained through an equally common prescription for temperature regulation by parental behavior."

The author comments, in conclusion, that his views may seem "anthropomorphic" (quotes his) to some readers. I am in complete agreement. Such phrases as "will avoid using," "if he is attending to what he is doing," "The bird avoids immediate repetition," "he hastens on," "Symptomatic of his concentration," "That a creature which is satisfied by small or poorly defined contrasts within its basic song-pattern will feel less need of variation," "and avoided repeating," abound. An abundance of objective data are treated to subjective interpretation from which the author concludes that "Song-develop- ment exhibits a trend toward unity in variety, i.e., beauty, which is to be expected if human nature is a further unfolding of tendencies pervading all life." All of the foregoing comes about as a result of the deduction that a bird which sings the same song over and over will have marked pauses between out- bursts, while more versatile songsters will sing without pauses. The author adequately documents his obervations that birds with a limited repertoire do pause between songs for longer periods than do those which have less limited abilities.-J. C.

This is a gratifyinoly comprehensive and up-to-date survey covering all the important aspects of bird migration.

The author has brought a vast amount of material to¢ether within the covers of a single book, and has balanced his coverage nicely. As comprehensive a survey as this cannot possibly be exhaustive in all aspects of so vast a subject, and specialists are certain to find the treatment of their own particular fields skimpy in spots, and will be able to point out flaws and errors. I find a number of inaccuracies, for instance, in the accounts of the migrations of the Arctic and Common Terns. (Perhaps I read those pages hypercritically because Dorst over- looked my maiden paper on the Arctic Tern (Bull. N.B.B.A., 1928: 121) th!ou¢h he is not the first to ignore it.) These petty faults detract very little from the book's general usefulness.
