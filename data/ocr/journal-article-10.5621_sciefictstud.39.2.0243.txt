<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 243 Umberto Rossi The Shunts in the Tale: The Narrative Architecture of Philip K. Dick’s VALIS Our Embarrassing Classic. I was surprised by the absence of Philip K. Dick in Farah Mendlesohn’s chapter on religion in the authoritative Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction. It is true that other names one would expect, such as James Blish, are also missing, but Blish is usually mentioned due to a single novel, A Case of Conscience (1958), while religious themes can be found in most of Dick’s oeuvre, from his early fantasy novel The Cosmic Puppets (1957), to his final works Radio Free Albemuth (wr. 1976, pub. 1985) and the VALIS TRILOGY, which comprises VALIS (1981), The Divine Invasion (1981), and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (1982).1 No wonder, then, that Antonio Caronia and Domenico Gallo felt they had to include an entry on “Religion” in their Dickian encyclopedia (211-16), which strives to summarize thirty years of Dick scholarship in Italy and abroad.2 Dick’s omission from Mendlesohn’s chapter might signal a certain critical embarrassment surrounding his later novels, especially the final trilogy. The embarrassment can be expressed in a tactful and indirect fashion, as Fredric Jameson did at the beginning of his most recent critical contribution on Dick, where he suggested partitioning the author’s oeuvre into cycles and then honestly explained: “One of the things I hope this can accomplish (without quite believing that it will) is ... to disconnect the religious thematics from the earlier works” (363). But there are more drastic opinions, such as those of Carl Freedman, who thinks that VALIS and The Divine Invasion are “pretentiously tedious” (165), or of Eric S. Rabkin, who commented: “Why did Dick really write the VALIS TRILOGY? He said his writing was an attempt to make sense of his life, and often so is insanity. Frankly, I think he did go insane” (186). This does not mean that critics have so far abstained from analyzing and interpreting the novels of Dick’s final trilogy. A quick search of any online bibliography proves that there are several academic articles and essays on at least two of its parts, namely VALIS and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer.3 But some scholars who have grappled with these problematic works show signs of unease; a typical example is Christopher Palmer’s reading of VALIS: what is shocking for the reader is the author’s admission that he believes in VALIS, or rather, Philip K. Dick’s admission that he believes in it. This is a literary effect ... largely brought about by the way in which, after Philip and Fat have split, Philip begins to participate in the obsessions and textual riffs that the split seemed to have assigned to Fat rather than to the often impressively wise and blunt Philip. It is also an effect that denies textuality, because it reduces the fiction to a screen through which we look at Dick’s belief in the existence of VALIS. (235)4  </page> <page sequence="2"> 244 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) One should explain here that the novel tells the story of two characters, Horselover Fat and Philip Dick, who live in Southern California in the 1970s. Phil is the narrating I of the novel, introducing himself as “a science fiction writer” who “deal[s] in fantasies” (VALIS 12)—clearly, an alter-ego for the author. As for Horselover Fat, his name is an interlinguistic pun (Philip comes from the Greek Philippos, “lover/friend of horses”; dick means “fat” in German), which tells us that he is also an alternate personality of the author. In fact, Dick clearly says that “I am Horselover Fat, and I am writing this in the third person to gain much-needed objectivity” (11).  The meaning of the double/split protagonist is relevant to any attempt to interpret the novel. It is true that “many of the incidents to be found in VALIS and Radio Free Albemuth are recounted and analyzed as events in Dick’s life, in his Exegesis and in interviews” (Palmer 235)—we might add Lawrence Sutin’s biography to those sources—and those events (including the death of Dick’s friend James Pike in 1969, heavy amphetamine addiction, suicide attempts, admission to a drugs rehabilitation center in Canada, a series of bewildering hallucinations in February and March 1974, the failure of Dick’s fifth and final marriage, and an obsessive interest in arcane theological issues) may well lead to or imply insanity (hence Rabkin’s hasty diagnosis). If Dick identifies with “the often impressively wise and blunt Philip,” as opposed to the deranged Fat, however, it may mean that in the last years of his life (VALIS was completed in 1978 and published in 1981, a year before the author’s death) the writer was distancing himself from his manias and obsessions, especially the visions of February-March 1974 (called “2-3-74” in the Exegesis). In other words, he was recovering from his mental illness.  But if Phil, the sane part of the split subject, “participate[s] in the obsessions and textual riffs that the split seemed to have assigned to Fat,” then there is no distancing from madness. Another critic who has developed Palmer’s insight, Darko Suvin, goes further: he notices that the viewing of the film VALIS in the second part of the novel persuades Fat’s friends (including Phil) that his supposed hallucinations are not just the ravings of a sick mind; it thus “becomes clear Phil was a disbelieving patsy, and his frequent and quite shrewd sardonic observations and rude hyperbolae were set up so that they can be confounded, wiping out the reader’s disbelief too” (383). Here Suvin makes clear (but also oversimplifies) what Palmer means when he says that Dick “denies textuality,” where textuality indicates (as we shall see later in more detail) the literary/ fictional character of a narrative. VALIS is actually a sort of pamphlet that aims at wiping out the reader’s disbelief, at persuading him that what happened to Fat, who is actually Philip K. Dick, the author of the novel, is true. VALIS is only apparently fiction: actually it is Dick’s Confessions, which, like those of St. Augustine, aim at converting the reader. As Palmer puts it, Dick “is characteristically a writer who challenges the reader’s capacity for belief”; by proposing his 2-3-74 experiences as something real, he subjects his readers to a “severe test of their powers of belief in the course of the novel” and, by pushing this test too far, finds “himself embroiled, risking disorientation, if not humiliation” (234).  </page> <page sequence="3"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 245 Far from rejecting Palmer’s argument in toto, I believe that he has presented us with a fundamental interpretive issue that any future reading of VALIS will have to tackle, though I think he did not go as far as he might have—and this is exactly what I will try to do in the remainder of this article. This will require a blow-by-blow analysis of the plot of VALIS, through which I will attempt to prove that the novel oscillates between trust and mistrust. In this narrative, the will to believe and scepticism struggle until the end, so that neither ultimately prevails; the novel is radically open, not only in terms of its ending, but also in terms of its genre.  A Split Novel. Actually VALIS is two novels in one, or two competing textual levels struggling against each other, belonging to two different literary genres: the autobiographical novel and religious science fiction. This split is a constitutive element of VALIS, and any discussion of the novel that aims to construct a unified interpretation, a monological reading, will always fall short of the fascinating duplicity of this book. Palmer is right when he maintains that here we encounter a “collision between ethical seriousness and a postmodern sense of the textuality of meaning” (237)—and it is not difficult to understand that the ethical seriousness is on the side of the autobiographical interpretation, while the “postmodern sense of the textuality of meaning,” if we read “textuality” as meta-fictionality, is on the side of religious sf. Palmer’s “collision” is there, and it is that collision that gives VALIS most of whatever literary value it may have. My analysis, which will attempt to chart the split in the novel, is based on the awareness that Dick often used literary conventions, images, figures, and situations deriving from different narrative genres. I have already argued that one of Dick’s less famous works, The Game Players of Titan (1963), heavily drew from the topoi of other sf writers, such as A.E. Van Vogt and the authors of the sociological sf of the 1950s, but also from crime fiction (see my “Game of the Rat”).5 Dick wrote many sf novels and stories, but also a dozen realistic novels (most of them posthumously published, some of them lost), an underrated but interesting fantasy novel (The Cosmic Puppets), and several fantasy short stories.6 Dick’s heterogeneous output was probably due less to deliberate choice than to economic constraints; basically, he was a professional sf writer who yearned till the end to escape the ghetto of popular genre fiction, with its scant remunerations, and move on to what he and his colleagues called the literary mainstream. At the same time, his writing was always able to move from one genre to another in the course of the same work, as in The Game- Players of Titan, and such shifts—which I have called shunts in a previous article—enable Dick to create an atmosphere of radical uncertainty that involves both his characters and his readers. The oscillation between two different genres, with different representational conventions and readers’ expectations, conveys an effect of ontological instability or uncertainty.7 Cryptic Revelation. The same may be said about VALIS. It starts out like a realistic novel describing the nervous breakdown of Horselover Fat: the setting is California in the early 1970s, the years of the ebbing of the 1960s </page> <page sequence="4"> 246 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) countercultural tide, and the story begins with the suicide of Gloria, a friend of Fat, followed by his wife’s insanity, the event that triggers his breakdown. There is nothing supernatural or science-fictional in Chapter 1, and the book adopts a rather traditional realist narrative mode, only complicated by the leaps of the narrating I that skip whole years: “This was 1971. In 1972 he would be up north.... In 1976 ... Horselover Fat would slit his wrist....” (10). The first genre shunt is placed at the beginning of Chapter 2, when the narrating I tells us how Fat managed to overcome his suicidal impulses: “The first thing that came along to save him took the form of an eighteen-year-old highschool girl ... and the second was God” (18). This is just a cryptic hint, which might also make us think that Fat simply found consolation, or tried to, in religious faith. But what happens to him two pages later is absolutely not a conventional moment of religious inspiration: God, he told us, had fired a beam of pink light directly at him, at his head, his eyes; Fat had been temporarily blinded and his head had ached for days. It was easy, he said, to describe the beam of pink light; it’s exactly what you get as a phosphene after-image when a flashbulb has gone off in your face. Fat was spiritually haunted by that color. Sometimes it showed up on a TV screen. He lived for that light, that one particular color. (20) Fat’s experience or vision is not directly shown to us: we (and Fat’s friends) are told about an experience that occurred at an undefined moment in the recent past. Moreover, God does not communicate with Fat in traditional ways, by means of a miracle, an acousmatic voice, or an inner feeling or illumination; instead, he hits Fat with a beam of pink light, something that resembles the laser weapons of cheap science fiction, acting as an alien visitor/invader. The reader is presented with not just two but three alternatives: (a) Fat is the victim of an hallucination (which is not surprising given his difficult psychological situation), and thus VALIS is a realistic novel that tells the story of a madman (with a hefty dose of irony and black humor); (b) Fat was really contacted by some alien entity by means of a technology so advanced that it seems miraculous, and VALIS is an sf novel talking about contacts with aliens; or (c) Fat has been contacted by God, and this is religious sf à la C.S. Lewis (which is, unsurprisingly, the favorite author of Dick’s devoutly Catholic friend, David [29]).  Phil, who should be the sensible narrator of Fat’s antics (or the sane part in a split and partly deranged mind), does not subscribe to his friend’s (or alternate personality’s) mystical point of view, but chronicles his subsequent search for God: in fact Fat begins a frantic quest for the ultimate truth behind his vision, whatever it, he, or she may be. I wish to underscore the fact that Fat does not possess an enlightening truth but must cope with an enigma: in fact the supernatural entity that has contacted him is called VALIS, an acronym standing for Vast Active Living Intelligence System (which is a rather vague definition), but this name comes, as we shall see, from a film within the text; Fat’s choice is “Zebra,” which is a code name for something elusive and almost impossible to explain. Zebra is like V. in Pynchon’s 1963 novel, an x or y in a narrative </page> <page sequence="5"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 247 equation; it also suggests camouflage, deception, invisibility, something (like a zebra) that is difficult to see at a distance.  Amateur Questers. Fat starts writing a journal called Tractates: Cryptica Scriptura to keep track of his meditations and discoveries, and the text is repeatedly quoted in the novel (the first excerpts can be found on p. 23). This text actually exists outside VALIS the novel, as the quotations come from Dick’s own mystical, philosophical, and religious journal, the Exegesis. But the attitude of Phil, the character in the novel, is not very respectful: he calls Fat’s (and thus, by implication, Philip K. Dick’s) journal “the furtive act of a deranged person” (22). Besides, Fat’s quest is a rather wild enterprise: it is not the scholarly research of a trained scholar, but the rambling pursuit of a self-taught thinker. Palmer objects to these frantic quotations from wildly different sources ranging from Plato to the Tibetan Book of the Dead: Each of these colorfully different texts, torn out of historical context, bathed in the warm solvents of esotericism, says the same thing, although, admittedly, what that same thing is changes from speculation to speculation. And this blurring of differentiation should be connected to an underlying literalism of interpretation.... (232) There is a name for this “adventurous syncretism” (Palmer 232), nonchalantly mixing so many sources from Plato to the Rosicrucians: textuality. Textuality is a condition where “text speaks to text” (Palmer 230-31), where quotation answers quotation and a new, esoteric name replaces the previous one. Textuality is also a condition typical of postmodernist literature (Palmer describes the atmosphere in the novel as “rhapsodic postmodernist restlessness” [232]), where characters (and their adventures) are a textual artifact only, a self- referential construct. Hence, according to Palmer, “Dick’s attempts to restore ‘thingness,’ phenomenological substance, to humble objects, are not successful here as they were in earlier novels” (232). Palmer quotes as an example an episode in the twelfth chapter of VALIS, where the narrator secretly baptizes his son using hot chocolate and a hotdog bun (207-209), which he finds unconvincing (233). Palmer does not seem to have noticed that this scene can also be found in the eighteenth chapter of Radio Free Albemuth (169) and that—according to Sutin (218)—it mirrors instructions Dick received by means of the information-rich pink beam that hit the writer during his 2-3-74 experiences. Yet this is one of many elements in the text that could bolster Palmer’s thesis that VALIS suggests—even to those who do not know that many episodes of the novel “are recounted and analyzed as events in Dick’s life, in his Exegesis and in interviews” (Palmer 235)—that the author believed in VALIS. But this “literary effect ... denies textuality” (Palmer 235): this may look like a postmodernist novel that playfully quotes a heterogeneous constellation of texts and does not pretend to have substantiality; it may resemble the rampantly citational works of Borges, Barth, or Pynchon, but it is actually a text that, by staging the author’s belief in what has been revealed in his February-March 1974 experiences, is reduced “to a screen through which we look at Dick’s belief in the existence of VALIS” (Palmer 235). </page> <page sequence="6"> 248 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) Palmer’s discussion of VALIS might in some points read like a denunciation of Dick as a charlatan; this is what a superficial reader might assume when Palmer talks about “the blurring between fictional and historical” taking place in “low” postmodernism (235 n16) and mentions as examples a few authors of fake memoirs/autobiographies, such as the white Australian writer Leon Carmen who published a novel, My Own Sweet Time (1994), in which he pretended to be an aboriginal woman, Wanda Koolmatrie; or the Swiss musician Bruno Dössekker who published a bogus Holocaust survivor memoir, Fragments (1995), under the pen name of Binjamin Wilkomirski. I am not sure that a writer such as Dick, who was fascinated by fakery and forgeries, would have found such comparisons insulting; however, Palmer does not really aim at denouncing Dick. Instead, he seeks to reject Scott Durham’s postmodern reading of the novel as a text where the author as a subject is abolished (Palmer 234), something that is declared in the very title of Durham’s article, which cites French theories on the “death of the subject.” How can the subject be abolished, or die, seems to be Palmer’s objection, if it is somewhat reasserted, if “the novel defeats our attempt to defend ourselves by saying that it is only a novel,” as it “denies its fictionality” (Palmer 236)? What Palmer finds in VALIS is a “collision between ethical seriousness and a postmodern sense of the textuality of meaning” (237). On the one hand, we have the actual suffering of characters (committing suicide, suffering from cancer or depression) and Dick’s direct implication in the novel as a believer in the reality of VALIS; on the other hand, we have the citational extravaganza that seems to annihilate the substantiality of meaning in a “threat to differentiation” (237), where all texts come to mean the same thing. This collision results in a “painful blockage” (237), according to Palmer, not a dissolution of the subject in textuality.  I think Palmer presents Durham’s article in an oversimplified fashion, inasmuch as its complete title is “From the Death of the Subject to a Theology of Late Capitalism”: Durham quotes, as an example of the death (or, better, disassembly) of the subject a scene in the fourteenth chapter of Dick’s novel The Simulacra (1964), where telekinetic (and schizophrenic) pianist Richard Kongrosian literally turns himself inside out, a moment when the science- fictional device of telekinesis turns the metaphor of madness as “delirious dissolution of subjectivity” (Durham 189) into a literal dismemberment. On the other hand, Dick’s last novels hint at a possible resurrection of the subject, no longer individual but collective, as the critic sees the theological component in VALIS as helping to conceive “a collective subject capable of grasping such contradictions” as the one between “the subject of countercultural experience and the subject of hegemonic social memory” (Durham 197), respectively embodied in the two halves of the split protagonist, Bob Arctor, in A Scanner Darkly (1977). According to Durham, in VALIS there is a momentary reunion of “the subject of memory to the delirious subject of experience” (197), and this may have a political meaning because the “theological madness ... proves to be the method by which a counter-culture attempts to think a counter-memory” (198). </page> <page sequence="7"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 249 Palmer’s and Durham’s analyses of VALIS are interesting because—their divergence of views notwithstanding—they both pivot on a contradiction that is undeniably present in the novel. There is a chasm in VALIS: no wonder, then, that the protagonist/narrator is split; no wonder that the text mixes scores of erudite quotations with episodes from Dick’s own life; no wonder that it is difficult to trace the borderline between fiction and autobiography; no wonder, eventually, that there are two different works struggling against each other, belonging to two different literary genres: autobiographical novel and religious science-fiction. As for Dick’s “literalism of interpretation,” this is something of which Dick himself was aware. This explains the presence of such a character as Maurice, the therapist who bullies Fat in Chapter 6, ordering him to “read Genesis over twice.... Two times. Carefully. And ... write an outline of the main ideas and events in it, in descending order of importance” (87). Maurice, an orthodox Jew who “had fought as an Israeli commando against the Syrians” (82), represents a literal interpretation of the Holy Writ and metonymically stands for the dangers of literalism in general—hence his comical refrain “And I mean it” (82).  Does Fat fall victim to a literalism of interpretation? He has such a heretical approach to the Holy Writ that an orthodox reader such as Maurice thinks Fat has not even read Genesis. Fat is moreover animated by an interpretive frenzy that bespeaks a radical uncertainty about the meaning of his visions. After his pink beam experience, Fat has no truth to preach to the heathens; he is no Christ-like figure, no rabbi who can teach his apostles a transcendental truth. Fat and Dick—unlike real prophets and messengers of any God worth considering—do not come equipped with the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Above all, Fat does not have a truth: the pink beam experience is mostly an enigma to him. One should not forget, for instance, this passage, where Phil describes what happens when Fat’s mystical experience is discussed: David continually quoted C.S. Lewis; Kevin contradicted himself logically in his zeal to defame God; Fat made obscure references to information fired into his head by a beam of pink light; Sherri, who had suffered dreadfully, wheezed out pious mummeries; I switched my position according to who I was talking to at the time. (29) If, according to Palmer, this novel wants to make us believe in Dick’s 2-3-74 experience (as he himself did), such scenes are not very effective: here the experience is presented as the manifestation of something unclear, obscure, enigmatic. Most of what happens in the 23 pages between the first mention of the pink beam and the second twist in the plot is not the announcement of some truth, but an uneasy questioning of a puzzling event—or its exegesis. The quotation from Heraclitus in Chapter 3, “The nature of things is in the habit of concealing themselves” (39), is probably less tied to ontology than to hermeneutics: concealed truths, the “latent structure,” must be laboriously deciphered and may well remain hidden. On the other hand, if Palmer is suggesting that Dick’s novel fails as a postmodernist narrative, being tainted by autobiographical truth, one may reply that it is a peculiar form of truth—because the 2-3-74 experience, the real-life event underlying VALIS and Fat’s mysterious </page> <page sequence="8"> 250 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) Zebra entity are just as mysterious. They were an enigma that Dick desperately tried to solve or debunk. On 5 September 1981, Dick wrote, in a letter to Ursula K. Le Guin: “I know that I do not know” (Selected 6: 242); here he refers to the 1974 experiences, and such a disconsolate admission of defeat is also found in his last interview with Gregg Rickman, where the writer declared: “I saw something, and I can remember it very well, but I don’t know what it was, what it signified.... I’ll never know what it was” (Rickman 51). The value of the mystical experience is also rather dubious in the novel, since Fat’s cryptic religious vision has not really saved him from his psychological disorder: in fact, he attempts to commit a spectacular suicide “with the pills, the razor sharp blade and the car engine” (43). If the so-far- undetermined message delivered through the pink beam is geared to save him from his initial nervous breakdown, we have to admit that what was told him was ineffective: “Encountering the living God had not helped to equip him for the tasks of ordinary endurance, which ordinary men, not so favored, handle” (46). Phil’s comment indirectly tells us that Fat’s experience was not illumination but madness, that “his brains are fried” (47). The supernatural element is discredited, and this shunt brings the narrative back to realistic fiction. Metapsychoanalytic Issues. This return to realism opens one of the worst moments in Fat’s life, when he is detained at the Orange County mental hospital, which is practically a prison. Should we then be surprised by the curious political-historical bent Fat’s visions assume in this part of the novel, when he starts to see the California of 1974 mysteriously superimposed on the Imperial Rome of 70 AD? If the mental hospital is a prison where Fat can be kept for an indefinite time, it is not that strange for him to discern “within the superimposition [of contemporary California and ancient Rome] a Gestalt shared by both space-time continua, their common element: a Black Iron Prison” (48). The reference to Gestalt psychology should make us aware that the Black Iron Prison is a form that may organize the single parts of which it is composed, holistically defining the political situation of Imperial Rome, modern California, and the very personal predicament of Horselover Fat, a wrecked individual prisoner of a mental hospital. The religious and esoteric symbols can thus be read as referring to a very concrete and mundane reality of suffering and despair—an individual reality, one should add. Let us not forget that the novel begins with Fat’s nervous breakdown, not with the pink beam. Moreover, the Black Iron Prison, the never-ending Roman Empire that underlies the apparent reality of California in the mid-1970s, may all too easily be read as a metaphor for the Nixonian America of COINTELPRO and other forms of political repression. Dick had complex biographical connections with this historical context due to the notorious burglary of his Santa Venetia house on 17 November 1971. One possible explanation for this enigmatic episode suggested by Dick was that the burglary was organized by some governmental agency that aimed to frame him (Williams 42-43); other explanations (it was done by Black </page> <page sequence="9"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 251 terrorists or Minutemen [Williams 38, 104-105]) also refer to the troubled political situation of those years.  After the suicide attempt and Fat’s hospitalization, however, the novel moves towards a new shunt—the intervention of Dr. Stone. What this unorthodox therapist actually does is cure Fat by means of a language he understands and accepts, that of his religious obsession (in what Stilling defines as a “metapsychoanalytic” sequence [96]). He first solves a contradiction between the two superimposed moments (the 1970s and 70 AD) in Fat’s vision by pointing out that—according to Fat himself—time ceased in 70 AD, so they are actually still in Roman times. Modern-day California is no more than a dream: humankind is still under the domination of the Roman imperium, a symbol of absolute political power. From Phil’s point of view, Stone’s intervention is worse than the illness it should cure: “Now Fat would never depart from faith in his encounter with God. Dr. Stone had nailed it down” (63). Stone’s subsequent therapeutic move is even more successful, though it once again ratifies his patient’s faith in the supernatural character of his experience: when asked an opinion on the Nag Hammadi manuscripts/library, one of the fundamental elements in Fat’s (and Dick’s) home-made theological system, Dr. Stone replies: “You would know.... You’re the authority” (65).8 With this reinstatement of Fat’s faith in himself, the psychological collapse triggered by the departure of his wife and, before that, Fat’s failure to save Gloria’s life, seems healed. The quester may not know who or what exactly has fired the pink beam at him, but he knows that there is an explanation that transcends ordinary reality—so the novel is once again a search for something supernatural or, since we are in a science-fictional atmosphere, for something alien. This search is dangerous, however, since Fat, once discharged from the asylum, goes to live with Sherri Solveig, a friend who suffers from cancer and is animated by a morbid self-destructive drive: she “did not merely plan to get sick again; she ... planned to take as many people with her as possible” (73). It is quite clear now that behind the first and most evident oppositions that structure the plot of the novel—i.e., realism vs. science fiction, madness vs. sanity, ordinary reality vs. supernatural entities—there is also an arguably more fundamental semic opposition, Freud’s classical dichotomy of Eros vs. Thanatos (Stilling 94). Fat is basically threatened by death (or the “Tomb World” repeatedly depicted in Dick’s fiction), embodied in the suicidal impulse that gets hold of him after Gloria’s suicide. The self-destructive drive is like a contagious disease that may easily spread to individuals with not enough spiritual antibodies—people weakened by physical suffering, such as Sherri, or by a shambolic life, such as Fat. While the novel oscillates between realism and fantasy or science fiction, Fat more or less successfully strives to steer away from death and reach life. It is through therapy that Dr. Stone has helped Fat to stave off death and grasp life again—and that is Eros.9 Sherri involves Fat in her own destruction, and that is surely Thanatos. Fat’s decision to live with Sherri (who has much in common with Gloria, whose suicide triggered Fat’s nervous breakdown) marks another genre shunt, however, because the question arises how a man who has been enlightened by </page> <page sequence="10"> 252 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) God (via a pink beam) can make such a blatant mistake as “to bind himself to the Antichrist” (74)—i.e., to Sherri, who “planned to take as many people with her as possible” (73). Phil’s understated question is: if God is on the side of life and healing (Eros), how can one who has really been touched by Him deliberately choose Thanatos? Transmogrified Autobiography. We are now at the beginning of the seventh chapter, and something remarkable happens: the critical, ironic distance between Phil and Fat seems to decrease. This is what worries Palmer: “Philip begins to participate in the obsessions and textual riffs that the split seemed to have assigned to Fat rather than to the often impressively wise and blunt Philip” (235). Nonetheless, we should remember once again what the sensible Phil tells us almost at the beginning of the novel: “I am Horselover Fat and I am writing this in the third person to gain much-needed objectivity” (11). The apparent distance between Phil the skeptic and Fat the visionary is exactly that: apparent. It is a fictional device that is craftily exploited by Dick to curb Fat’s interpretive obsession, but his interest in esoteric literature and ancient religious texts cannot be completely neutralized because Fat and Dick are, after all, the same person. The Fat/Phil couplet is similar to Bob/Fred in A Scanner Darkly, the split godhead in The Divine Invasion, and the amnesiac Ragle Gumm in Time Out of Joint (1959). These split characters or subjects cannot be read simply in relation to narrative objectivity (or its loss); rather, they complicate our understanding of the relation between subjectivity and objectivity by showing a different sort of subject. In other words, Philip Kindred Dick the writer is both Phil-the- skeptic and Fat-the-Visionary; this split self-portrait is his way of depicting the unyielding contradictions in his own experience of self. (Philosophers can tell us whether this is a special case or is representative of the general conditions of subjectivity in the postmodern or late-modern age.)  Fat and Phil’s search is precisely that, however—a search, not a preaching of dogmatic truths. Parsifal, another quester, is mentioned in the novel (40), and David is seen reading a paperback book by T.S. Eliot (205), an edition that may well contain The Waste Land (1922), a poem about a quest.10 Being involved in a quest does not automatically confer enlightenment, but rather involves a search for the light; the condition of the quester is one of doubt, not certainty. It is interesting that as Phil begins to discuss the same esoteric texts that Fat loves so much (such as the hymn by Ikhnaton cited at the beginning of chapter 7 [101- 102]), he quotes Heraclitus “without getting Fat’s permission” (117) and then one of his interpreters, Edward Hussey: “the infinitely old divinity is a child playing a board game as he moves the cosmic pieces in combat according to rule” (117). The image of a god who treats humans like “pieces on a board” (118) must have chimed with Dick’s paranoid streak—characters who are unconsciously or subconsciously manipulated abound in his oeuvre.11 The pink beam communicated or broadcast something, but that message, however important, is not easy to decode: the moves of the child god may be totally obscure to his pawns—not least because God may be totally different from mortal creatures, as different as an alien from another planet. And it may also </page> <page sequence="11"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 253 be that what we call God is not what we have always meant by that term (VALIS 118). Both Fat and Phil are prey to a radical and unstoppable form of doubt, more puzzling than Descartes’s ontological one, according to which the thinking subject could be a madman who only dreams the apparent reality surrounding him.12 We may agree with Palmer that “what is shocking for the reader is the author’s admission that he believes in VALIS, or rather, Philip K. Dick’s admission that he believes it” (235). But what is VALIS, then? In the novel we are presented with a jumble of hypotheses, but the characters never achieve certainty; another move by the cosmic player and the pieces on the board (the characters) must discard their hypotheses and restart their interpretation of old and new clues. It may be, as Phil suspects in the eighth chapter, that the being that fired the pink beam at Fat is not God, but Fat himself, or, better, Fat as he will be in a future moment. The identity of Zebra—the code name Fat has assigned to the entity that has contacted him (102)—could thus be something that is not transcendental: “Zebra is all the selves along the linear time-axis, laminated into one super- or trans-temporal self which cannot die, and which has come to save Fat” (132). This hypothesis creates another textual shunt, because if we take this laminated self as someone or something that can retroactively act upon his old self backwards in the time flux, then we have to accept the idea of time-travel, albeit a form limited to information. This is a typical science- fictional idea, featured most prominently in Gregory Benford’s novel Timescape (1980), so VALIS thus moves from theological sf to time-travel sf.  Or is it autobiography? One should compare the above passage about laminated selves with one of Dick’s letters where he describes his 2-3-74 experiences. Writing to Peter Fitting, he describes the “colored graphics ... resembl[ing] the non-objective paintings of Kandisky and Klee” that were shot into his brain by the pink beam; these came “so fast as to resemble ‘flash cut’ use [sic!] in movie work” (Selected Letters, vol. 3 142-43). This passage does not have recourse to religious explanations, but interprets the bewildering phenomenon as information from the future transferred by means of tachyons. Unlike Fat, Dick tries to explain his experiences with scientific—albeit not yet demonstrated—theories, maintaining that “[w]ithout the tachyon theory I would lack any kind of scientific foundation and would have to declare that ‘God has shown me the sacred tablets in which the future is written’ and so forth, as did our forefathers” (143). Moreover, Zebra, considered as the sum of all his selves laminated into one trans-temporal identity, might simply be Philip Kindred Dick writing his own story in 1978, staging his own 2-3-74 experience with considerable hindsight (in any moment our self is made up of all or most of our past selves), and communicating with his own fictional alter-ego Horselover Fat. Here we would have postmodernist metafiction, not religious preaching. It is worth noting that there are several Dick novels that posit the author as a demiurge creating worlds in the process of falling apart: The Game-Players of Titan (1963), The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1964), Ubik (1969), A Maze of Death (1970), and Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said (1974).13 Christopher Palmer may be right when he argues that the interference of </page> <page sequence="12"> 254 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) autobiography and religious sf denies textuality, but there is more to postmodernist fiction than textuality conceived as self-referential citation; metafictionality—the inclusion of the writer in the text—is just as important. An exhaustive definition should probably include both Palmer’s textuality and metafictionality, but also, and above all, Brian McHale’s more complex concept of textuality as ontological uncertainty.14 VALIS: The Movie. In any case, the novel does not end here, and the oscillation takes us back again to theology and supernatural possibilities. Kevin, Phil’s and Fat’s ultra-skeptical friend (a purported portrait of Dick’s real friend K.W. Jeter, another sf writer15), invites them and David to see “a science-fiction film” entitled Valis (138), whose screenplay has been written by Eric Lampton, the leader of the rock group Mother Goose. The film is described in detail by Dick (139-44); suffice it to say that much of its plot is a rehashing of the storyline of Radio Free Albemuth, considered to be an earlier version of VALIS.16 The film contains a welter of allusions to what Fat has seen in his mystical visions: pink light beams, three-eyed aliens, a meaningful little clay pot, the Christian fish sign. Some of these images appear in the background, so that only initiates who have seen the film multiple times may recognize them; some are explained in unexpected ways, such as the source of the information- rich beam being an alien satellite called VALIS, or the fish sign being identified with Crick and Watson’s double helix model of DNA (146). Seeing the film radically changes the attitude of Fat’s friends to his “lurid schizophrenic episode”: “Kevin had gone to the movie and now he was not so sure; the Mother Goose flick had shaken him up” (153).  After more wild hypotheses and interpretations of Valis the movie, Fat and Company, now dubbed “The Rhipidon Society” (a name Dick connects to the early Christian Ichthys symbol, since rhipidon means “fin” in Greek [171]), contact Eric Lampton and his wife Linda, plus their friend Brent Mini, an experimental musician who composed the film’s soundtrack. A phone call before the actual meeting already changes something important in the novel. When Phil says that it was not he who was “told things” (168)—i.e., received information from VALIS—because “[t]he information was fired at my friend Horselover Fat,” Lampton immediately unmasks his fictional alter-ego: “But that’s you. ‘Philip’ means ‘Horselover’ in Greek.... ‘Fat’ is the German translation of ‘Dick.’ So you’ve translated your name.” One might object that dick is the German translation of “fat,” but Lampton has in any case decoded Dick’s interlinguistic pun and has reminded us, after more than 150 pages, that Dick and Fat are one. This might mean that Lampton, who is not fooled by Dick’s fictional device, is endowed with the truth—gnostically speaking, with Sophia, the divine wisdom.  In fact, the Lampton family may be said to be literally endowed with Sophia, as the Rhipidon Society discovers when they travel to Sonoma, because Sophia is the name of their two-year-old daughter (189), who is presented by Lampton as the reincarnation of the Messiah (Christ but also Buddha [169]): “This time ... for the first time, the Savior takes female form” (189). But before this </page> <page sequence="13"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 255 revelation, another shunt operates in Chapter 11: after talking with the Lamptons, Phil tells David that “they’re crazy” (181). What they have said may fit the findings of Fat’s esoteric research, but when they claim to belong to Ikhnaton’s race of three-eyed aliens with claw-like hands (175-76), they push their act too far, mixing the story of Pharaoh Akhenaten/Ikhnaton with aliens straight out of conspiracy theories about Area 51. When they finally meet Sophia, in the climactic twelfth chapter of the novel, the Ripidon Society discovers that the little girl who should be the embodiment of divine wisdom has an absolutely no-nonsense approach to life: “Your suicide attempt was a violent cruelty against yourself” (190), she tells Phil, and when he tries to parry this by saying “It was Horselover Fat,” she replies “Phil, Kevin and David. Three of you. There are no more” (notice that the three characters are ordered in such a way that their initials spell out PKD). Horselover Fat is exposed as a projection of Phil’s sick mind, at the same time a product of his madness and the representation of that madness. Sophia can seemingly heal the split personalities and make Phil whole again; if this is the sign of her belonging to the side of Eros, not Thanatos (while the Lamptons, as we shall see, ultimately ally themselves with the forces of destruction), then we should also understand that her message is not at all deranged or nonsensical. Kim Stanley Robinson has acknowledged this, suggesting that what Sophia says “is very simple, very humanistic” (116-17) and quoting two highly relevant passages from the novel (VALIS 198, 213) that express an idea of God as something inside us, a salvific force in the human mind. “[H]uman beings should now give up the worship of all deities except mankind itself” (213): this is the summation of Sophia’s message to Phil and his friends, an idea that strikes me as surprisingly closer to William Blake’s anthropomorphic conception of the universe than to the ravings of a madman.17 Definitely not a preacher, Dick remained a novelist until the end, and thus this truth is not presented as something ultimate and incontrovertible. There are already doubts about Sophia when the Rhipidon Society is in the Lamptons’ house in Sonoma (195-96), though Kevin, the stubborn skeptic, dispels them by pointing out that one thing is certain: Sophia has healed Phil. “You stopped believing you were two people. You stopped believing in Horselover Fat as a separate person” (196-97). If even Kevin appears ready to accept Sophia as the Redeemer, then readers can be forgiven for believing that the quest is over and the Grail has been reached at last. No wonder that Sophia speaks like a Rabbi and preaches (something Fat was unable to do, his visions notwithstanding), delivering truths and revelations (198-200) and giving the trio their “commission” (198) as a deputized agent of the deity would do. But a devastating blow to the notion that Sophia is the Savior, and a further shunt in the tale, comes when, after Phil, Kevin, and David return home, Linda Lampton phones the writer to announce that Sophia has died in a failed experiment during which Brent Mini tried to gather information from the child through laser beams (215). “[I]f Sophia was the Savior, how could she die?” asks Linda, expressing the radical doubt that the other characters (and also we readers) must share: how </page> <page sequence="14"> 256 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) could the thanatoid forces of insanity (Mini’s experiment) prevail if Sophia was the true embodiment of Eros/God? Dick’s Own Little Apocalypse. Does VALIS then end as a realistic novel depicting a case of madness (the split between Phil and Horselover Fat), plus the tragedy of a small sect of self-deluded individuals (the Lamptons and Brent Mini)?18 Or does the comeback of Horselover Fat at the beginning of the fourteenth and last chapter (216) imply that the realistic narrative is once again shunted toward the domain of theological sf, with Fat starting to spin out his theories and manifesting his intention to continue his quest (217)? I think that we may try to answer these questions only if we carefully read the final paragraph of the novel. We are told that Fat has left, and is searching for truth all around the world; but Phil has not followed him: “My search kept me at home; I sat before the TV set in my living room. I sat; I waited; I watched; I kept myself awake. As we had been told, originally, long ago, to do; I kept my commission” (228). The image of a troubled middle-aged man sitting on a sofa before a TV set is hardly geared to make one think of an ultimate achievement or revelation. The transcendent truth that the searchers have been looking for has not been found. Fat keeps hunting for it, but Phil seems to have given up. Could this be a form of modernist irony, à la T.S. Eliot, who scattered many hints about the legend of the Holy Grail throughout his Waste Land (1922) but ended the poem with a failure to find the mythic relic (and the meaning of life for which it stands)? Is the quest bound to be miscarried in our secularized world? Or is this an anticipation of the third part of the VALIS TRILOGY, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, where the protagonist, Angel, rejects the metaphysical quest of bishop Tim Archer and chooses this world, this life?  This concluding paragraph actually reads like a rewriting of an important passage in another text that Dick knew quite well, the Gospel of Mark (already mentioned in Chapter 5 [75]). When Phil says “I waited; I watched,” he clearly refers to the ending of the “Little Apocalypse,” where Christ exhorts his followers: “for ye know not when the master of the house cometh.... And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch” (Mark 13:25-37). “As we had been told, originally, long ago, to do,” thinks Phil, “I kept my commission” (228)—the commission being Christ’s exhortation to watch. This is a very important passage in that Gospel, since Biblical scholars have hypothesized that Mark, which plays a special role as the source or one of the sources of both Matthew and Luke, originally ended here, when Christ says “watch” (see Kermode 71- 72). What follows Mark 13 would then be an appendix subsequently added by an anonymous editor. This is not the right place for an exegetical discussion, but we should not overlook the fact that at the end of his novel Dick chooses to quote a part of Mark’s Gospel that might be the real ending; because the ending of the fourteenth chapter of VALIS might not be the real ending of the novel.  In fact, the paragraph I have quoted is followed by an Appendix that collects all the excerpts of Fat’s Tractates (and Dick’s Exegesis), something that might seem gratuitous or, worse, might be read as upholding Fat’s crackpot esoteric revelations (being placed at the end of VALIS, these fragments could amount to </page> <page sequence="15"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 257 the moral of the story)—were it not that the final fragment says: “From Ikhnaton this knowledge passed to Moses, and from Moses to Elijah, the Immortal Man, who became Christ. But underneath all the names there is only one Immortal man; and we are that man” (241; emphasis in original). Palmer has noticed that “[e]ach of these colorfully different texts, torn out of its historical context ... says the same thing” (232). Dick was probably aiming at this: he ends the book VALIS with the revelation that we (he, his characters, his readers, all of us) are Christ, the Messiah, the Savior, the principle of Eros and healing, the divine wisdom, or Sophia. Ikhnaton the monotheist pharaoh, Moses and Elijah the prophets, Christ the Messiah, and all the other esoteric and religious texts that have been mentioned, quoted, and discussed in VALIS, once inside the space of fiction, all turn into fiction, all become characters in a complicated story that is perhaps not so complicated because, after all, we are talking about a man and his mortal terrors, his hopes, his feelings—and we are that man.19  Dick placed a fragment that identifies prophets and messiahs with us as readers at the end of the Appendix (which follows Dick’s own Little Apocalypse, the ending of Chapter 14); of course, this is a strategic position, allowing the author to bring everything into the only field where we all meet, believers and unbelievers, visionaries and skeptics: real life, our shared reality with all its laminations, the koinos kosmos (another key concept in Dick’s oeuvre), where all the private worlds intersect in the most complicated ways. This does not mean that the religious dimension of the novel is annihilated and replaced by some sort of lukewarm humanism. It means that by leaving the ending open, with Phil watching and waiting, Dick leaves the two competing texts in a sort of literary equilibrium. Is it religious sf or autobiographical fiction? It is both, and it can be read as both. It is up to the reader to choose one of the two texts or else to leave them in this bewildering suspension; if this novel is a house, its doors are left open to skeptics and believers, atheists and the faithful.  VALIS: Its Architecture, Its Place on the Map. Palmer rightly observes in his study that “in the contemporary world, the boundaries between art and life, fiction and information, have been erased in ironic fulfillment of the ambition of the avant-garde, so that ... it is possible to treat news as fiction or entertainment” (236). This loss of boundaries is what Dick has craftily staged in his novel, thanks to the textual shunts that I have described in this essay. The overall effect of these shunts, or ontological changes in what is being told or imagined or hallucinated in the text, is not a reassertion of the truth of the 2-3- 74 experience as it was lived by Philip K. Dick the writer. VALIS mixes autobiography and fiction, so it can be read as what Smith and Watson call an “autofiction” (186), a hybrid form that allows Dick to explore the quandaries of the late-modern or postmodern subject. One might mention the example of autofiction suggested by Smith and Watson in their discussion of life narratives, Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes (1975), but there are other interesting specimens that are more relevant. One of them was written by an author who started out in sf just as Dick did, J.G. Ballard, whose The Kindness of Women </page> <page sequence="16"> 258 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) (1991) has been read—like VALIS—as part of a “life trilogy” also including the semi-autobiographical novel Empire of the Sun (1984) and the compact autobiography Miracles of Life (2008), where the three parts offer different takes on the narrative materials of Ballard’s own life. Another text generally read as a novel that could qualify as a sort of autofiction was also written by a former sf author, Kurt Vonnegut, whose Slaughterhouse-5 (1969) unashamedly mixes autobiography and sf, allowing the author to tackle his traumatic wartime experiences by projecting the fictional alter-ego of Billy Pilgrim (who meets Vonnegut in a moment of the story, but mostly replaces him à la Horselover Fat).  Like Ballard’s life trilogy or Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5, Dick’s novel denies any simplistic concept of textuality as a playful and irresponsible game with narrative materials; it complicates our ideas about the relationship between fiction and nonfiction, between the author’s life and works. By depicting the split subject of the autobiographical narrative, it complicates our ideas about life itself: the quest for VALIS may simply be Dick’s own quest for himself—as a real, historical individual, or a character (or some characters) in his fiction. Dick’s complex game of mirrors (some of them definitely dark) should help us to understand that the relationship between autobiographical reliability and fantastic invention is more complex than a binary opposition. If Phil is and is not Fat, Fat does not coincide exactly with Phil; the same may be said about these two literary genres, each one based on a different relation between text and life. It is such a complex relation that Dick felt he could not stop there and had to continue his quest, and I do not mean the writing of the Exegesis; VALIS was the starting point of another quest, which gave us the two following parts of the triptych, The Divine Invasion and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer. The fact that Dick’s death stopped this literary quest will not be seen—I hope—as a merely biographical accident.  NOTES 1. Dick himself said that the three novels made up a trilogy in one of the published fragments of his Exegesis, his chaotic 8,000-page accumulation of notes (see In Pursuit of VALIS 239). A more detailed discussion of the structure of the VALIS TRILOGY can be found in my Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (209-15). 2. The issue of religion in Dick is also discussed in McKee’s Pink Beams, a short monograph whose faults are outweighed by its open-minded discussion of the topic. 3. See, for instance, the MLA online bibliography or the author-specific resource, VALBS (Vast Active Living Bibliographic System), which focuses on Dick’s secondary bibliography. 4. Palmer’s reading of VALIS was originally published in SFS (Nov. 1991), before being gathered into his book-length study of Dick in 2003. 5. For a recent and well-researched survey of American sociological sf, see Luckhurst (109-19). 6. Dick’s lost novels have been catalogued by Andrew M. Butler in his compact guide to the author. 7. The implications of such an oscillation, which is typical of postmodernist fiction, for the referential potential of a novel—i.e., its ability to deal with the reader’s historical </page> <page sequence="17"> THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF DICK’S VALIS 259 world—are discussed in my article “Fourfold Symmetry” and analyzed more thoroughly in my book The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick. 8. Stone might also be a stand-in for Russell Galen, Dick’s literary agent, who bolstered “his self-confidence in his own importance as a thinker who had something legitimate to say for publication. It was meaningful to him to realize that someone in the publishing industry took him seriously as a philosopher. Thus encouraged, he felt freer to build Valis around his own persona and experiences” (Galen, personal email, 6 Sept. 2010). Galen proposed to an editor of an important publishing house a collection of Phil’s letters, essays, articles, and other nonfiction pieces; though the book never appeared, Galen’s efforts had a positive effect on Dick’s self-confidence. 9. Therapy is one of the four corners of the semiotic scheme that Jameson has used  persuasively to identify the fundamental semantic coordinates of Dick’s works of the 1960s (Jameson 376, 382)—those coordinates are, however, still valid for Dick’s later output. 10. Numerous references to Parsifal’s search for the Holy Grail are scattered throughout the novel. 11. This is not to mention his narrative strategies, among which the manipulation of genre conventions (and readers’ expectations) plays a fundamental role (Rossi, “Game of the Rat” 207-26). 12. Cf. Jameson’s idea of an “android cogito” in Dick’s fiction (373-74). 13. See my Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick for more on this theme in his work. 14. There is another important aspect of textuality that Palmer does not discuss—that is, the quotation of Dick’s own works, such as when A Scanner Darkly is discussed in Chapter 7 of VALIS (106-109), or that novel’s citation of some lines from Goethe’s Faust (88) that had already been quoted in a key passage of Time Out of Joint (see Rossi, “Just a Bunch of Words”); Dick even prefigures the third part of the VALIS TRILOGY, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, when he mentions Fat’s friendship with Bishop James Pike (76-77). 15. This identification should be taken with a grain of salt. It is true that Kevin might be a portrait of Jeter, just as David may represent Timothy Powers, both sf writers and close friends of Dick, but Robert Galbreath has suggested that Phil, Kevin, and David, whose initials spell out PKD, might actually all be aspects of Dick’s own (split?) personality (119). Besides, K.W. Jeter himself has said that he “wasn’t a complete church-burning skeptic.... Phil wasn’t this completely befuddled person,” and Powers was not “a complete religious no-doubt fundamentalist” (qtd. in Sutin 258). Thus, reading VALIS as autobiographical fiction does not mean reading it as a barely disguised biography. 16. Butler, however, considers it as “more than just the first draft of VALIS” (103), and I tend to agree: the process that converted Radio Free Albemuth into VALIS was so radical and extensive that what we are left with are two independent works. The former is a strongly dystopian sf novel that decries the conservative backlash triggered by Nixon’s election in 1968, while the second is a much more complex and ambitious work, bordering on realistic fiction, memoir, and theologically inspired science-fiction, where the political dimension is not so important—though it is not completely absent. Moreover, Sutin also shows that the film Valis was inspired by a real-world movie, Nicolas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth (1975), which starred David Bowie as an alien quasi-messiah; according to Sutin, “Phil loved it, and for a short time he and Jeter listened closely to Bowie albums, hoping to discern a sly pop sign from God/Valis/ Zebra” (258). </page> <page sequence="18"> 260 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) 17. I should add that here the genre shunt turns the theological sf novel into a simple religious novel, because we may take Sophia as the metaphorical or symbolic figure of a wisdom that, while directly inspired by God, may be reached through a process of inner growth; however, the novel enters the territory of theological sf once more when Phil is struck by a pink beam that causes a time slip (204), helping him to escape the deranged Lamptons and insuring that the Rhipidon Society will not be involved in Sophia’s accidental death. 18. Dick was well aware of the dangers of religious fanaticism: its effects are represented by the tragedy of the Lamptons, but they are also evoked by the brief allusion to the 1978 mass suicide in Jonestown (220), organized by religious leader Jim Jones. 19. This idea is already present in Pierre Klossowski’s labyrinthine novel-essay La vocation suspendue (1950), which explores the complexities and contradictions of any novel presenting itself as a religious text.

Dick’s VALIS (1981), scholars often seem to display critical embarrassment when dealing with the novel (and others that emerged during the final years of Dick’s career). The pervasive religious elements in the novel have often been read as symptoms of the author’s insanity. This article aims at proposing a different approach to those elements, by means of a blow-by- blow analysis of the plot that shows how its underlying ontological uncertainty works in narratological terms. In this reading, the novel operates by means of a series of “genre shunts” that shuttle back and forth among realistic fiction, theological sf, postmodern metafiction, and other literary forms. </page> </plain_text>
