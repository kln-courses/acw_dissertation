<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert Bruce Cowan Hunter College, CUNY Fear of Infinity: Friedrich SchlegePs Indictment of Indian Philosophy in ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier Introduction: The Fear of Infinity Friedrich Schlegel was one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of the affiliation of German thought with Indian religious and philosophical ideas. His fervent enthusiasm for Hindu philosophy that began in 1797, however, atrophied into accusations of nihilism by 1808. While he continued the tradi tion of locating the origins of the Germans in India that found its most influ ential proponent in Johann Gottfried Herder, in ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier (1808), Schlegel also found Hinduism and Buddhism to be a perversion of primordial truth, thus establishing a viewpoint about Asian reli gions that would prove detrimental to the exegesis of Asian religious texts by Europeans well into the twentieth century. As it unfolds in the composition of the book, the primary problem for SchlegeLs encounter with Indian thought, and the reason for his eventual adversarial stance toward it, is the irreconcil ability of Eastern concepts, such as the void out of which the universe is believed in Hinduism to have been created and destroyed, with their lack of equivalents in Western religions. The problem Schlegel had with the concept of the void, in particular, is indicative of what one might call his Tear of infin ity.77 SchlegeLs fascination with Sanskrit literature reflects his longing to find in India a response to the challenge of Romanticism: a unifying spiritual revolu tion, outside traditional classical and Christian frameworks, that might syn thesize religion, philosophy, and art. Schlegel emphasized the similarities between Vedantic philosophy and German idealism, which both center on questions of dualism. SchlegeLs conversion to Catholicism during the same week in April 1808 in which ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier was published, however, is also indicative of such longing. Novalis saw Hinduism as paving the way for Christianity, and Schlegel, like Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, not only agreed with this formulation, but increasingly believed Hinduism was but a pale shadow of the perfected Christianity to come. (Per haps Novalis died too young to become adversarial about it.) This is already The German Quarterly 81.3 (Summer 2008) 322</page><page sequence="2">COWAN: Friedrich Schlegel 323 foreshadowed in ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier in his exegesis of Sanskrit texts such as the Manusmriti, the R?m?yana, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the Bhagavad Git?, and Abhijn?nas?kuntalam. Schlegel's spiritual difficulty did not lie, however, in an inability to commit to religious principles. It lay in an untenably enthusiastic initial investment in ideas whose apparent paradoxes he was unable to work out satisfactorily, causing him then to retreat from his zealous position. Dorothy M. Figueira and Bradley Herling have noted in Schlegel a dynamic identified by Edward Said in Fhe World, the Text, and the Critic, in which initial unbridled enthusiasm for a foreign philosophical system reverses into tremendous disillusionment with and eventual condemnation of it (Figueira 56-57, Herling 117, Said 27). While I agree on the whole with Figuera7s criticisms of Said7s and Martin BernaPs polemical arguments against German Indology as being static and monolithic in its views, I also think that Schlegel's disenfranchisement with Sanskrit does, as Said intimates, foster stereotypes about Asian religions as nihilistic. Recently, Chen Tzoref-Ashkenazi has faulted Figueira for underes timating the import of the political stance in Schlegel's book; however, SchlegePs nationalism is a spiritual problem, framed by notions of origin and destiny. Nationalism is a metaphysical and eschatological issue for Schlegel and his eventual indictment of Hindu philosophy is based on SchlegePs non-acceptance of metaphysical concepts that have no classical or Christian counterparts. The concept of "the void77?the empty expanse out of which the universe may have arisen and may one day return?was an accepted part of Indian thinking beginning in ancient times. Used as a placeholder in ancient Babylo nian mathematics, it was not until zero made its way to India via trade routes that it became a symbol that would be understood differently from any other mathematical expression, one used to designate absence. Charles Seife points out that India was a logical site for the transformation of zero, for the Rig Veda (c.l2th century BC), the most ancient work of the Indian religious tradition, states that the fires of creation arose out of the void at the beginning of this eon of the universe's existence, and all things would eventually return to that void at its end (66). On the other hand, in the foundational civilizations of the West, notably ancient Greece, the idea of infinity, be it in matter or a vacuum, was suspect. Mathematical and philosophical foundations derived out of a void would not be found among the Greeks, with whom Schlegel was so enamored early in his intellectual development. Aristotle distinguishes between physics, which deals with things that are both inseparable from matter and are subject to movement, and metaphysics, which treats that which both exists in separa tion from matter and is motionless. He concludes in Ilepi) Oyparjoy [On the Heavens] (c.350 BC) I, 9:</page><page sequence="3">324 The German Quarterly Summer 2008 It is plain, then, from what has been said [in his earlier explanation of the hea vens], that there is not, nor do the facts allow there to be, any bodily mass be yond the heaven. The world in its entirety is made up of the whole sum of availa ble matter (for the matter appropriate to it is, as we saw, natural perceptible body), and we may conclude that there is not now a plurality of worlds. (91) In his Toov Mex? Ta c^uoiK? [Metaphysics] (c.350 BC), Aristotle then uses his argument against infinity, combined with some attributional logic, to prove the necessary existence of divinity. He argues that the existence of at least one unchangeable being, which causes motion while remaining unmoved itself, is shown by the impossibility of an infinite series of existent sources of move ment. In Aristotle's reality, the universe is composed of moving spheres that produce the music of the cosmos, each one moving the one before it, until the outermost sphere that contains all others is reached. This sphere is moved by divinity and there is nothing beyond it. Thus, Aristotle's proof of the existence of divinity refutes the idea of infinity. This description of the cosmos, among Aristotle's other ideas and writings, lived on through the Middle Ages in Is lamic scholars7 translations and, in modified form, in the Ptolemaic system (which used Aristotle to j ustify its earth-centered description of the universe), only to be "rediscovered77 in Europe in the sixteenth century. In the Middle Ages, however, Indian mathematicians such as Bhaskara (12th century) ar gued that dividing a positive number by zero resulted in an infinite quantity, leading them to reverse Aristotle's argument and assert that zero proves the existence of divinity. When the Islamic world encountered zero in trading with Southern Asia, Muslim thinkers eventually used the idea of the existence of a void to overturn Neo-Aristotelianism during this same period, handing down many of their ideas via Scholasticism. The creation of the universe out of a void would be just one of the funda mental concepts of Hinduism that incorporate the infinite in ways that proved perplexing for Europeans, since they have neither classical nor Judeo-Christian counterparts. During the Renaissance and Enlightenment, however, and in particular due to the age of naval exploration, unusual terms and concepts began to make their way into European thought. The early Ger man Romantics did not retain an interest in mathematics, and in fact, in the tradition of Reformation Protestants, rejected empirical proofs of divine exis tence. The Hindu concept of the void, however, as they would understand it through the first translations of and commentaries on Sanskrit texts, proved fascinating and problematic for them, and in particular, for Schlegel. He viewed Hindu and Buddhist doctrines concerning infinity, transcendence of materiality, and nirvana as indications of the loss of revealed truth, which, though such truth may have originated in the subcontinent, would only be re-discovered in Judea. The aim of the present analysis is not to find evidence of the accuracy of SchlegeLs Sanskrit translations?which for the most part are considered adequate, although scholars such as Antoine Berman and</page><page sequence="4">COWAN: Friedrich Schlegel 325 Ursula Oppenberg note that August Wilhelm SchlegeLs command of Sanskrit was superior?but to illustrate how his commentaries on Sanskrit texts foster misconceptions about Asian religions. This essay is therefore intended as a contribution to the recent line of scholarship concerning the role of Germany in postcolonial studies, as a site of what Sheldon Pollack has called "internal colonialism,77 that is, a milieu in which South Asian philosophies and literatures were used to expand the boundaries, influence, and importance of Germanic culture itself. SchlegeLs ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier has historically been either credited with having begun the study of comparative Indo-European linguistics in Germany or faulted as proto-nationalistic. In Douglas T. McGetchin7s, Peter K. J. Park's, and Damodar SarDesaLs recent anthology, Park usefully empha sizes the importance of the text in the context of Biblical philology in Ger many and Tzoref-Ashkenazi elaborates on its political import. This essay does not concern the tension between SchlegeLs Catholicism and the Protestant framework of German romanticism and nationalism so much as the role of SchlegeLs text in introducing the field of Indology to the Germanic states in a way that would prove influential in perpetuating myths about Hinduism and India. Such myths had begun in the work of Hellenistic and Roman historians and Schlegel ultimately places Eastern teachings in a hierarchy below those of Christianity, for, as Wilhelm Halbfass remarks, his ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier is "primarily a philosophical statement77 (75). I. SchlegePs Irony and Faith Among the early German Romantics, the four figures that would become most enthralled with ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts and medieval San skrit drama were Novalis, Schelling, and the two brothers Schlegel. The Indo logical groundwork laid by French and English scholars like Abraham-Hya cinthe Anquetil-Duperron, Pierre Sonnerat, William Jones, and Warren Hastings had been absorbed and elaborated upon by Immanuel Kant, Herder, and Friedrich Majer in the German principalities, having a direct impact on the early Romantics. Novalis and Schelling would derive inspiration for philosophies of becoming, characterized by an oscillation between the annihi lation and restoration of order, from the drama Abhij''?a?asakuntal'am ("The Recognition of Shakuntala,77 lst-4th century AD) and the mystical lyric poem Gitagovinda (12th century). The same oscillation between annihilation and restoration embodied in one philosophy occurs in the work of Friedrich Schlegel, best exemplified by his doctrine of irony. Novalis and the Schlegel brothers were immensely excited by Johann Gottlieb Fichte's work and lec tures at Jena University, and SchlegeLs notion of romantic irony draws from Fichte the idea of a creative subjectivity so sublimely free as to be disengaged</page><page sequence="5">326 Fhe German Quarferly Summer 2008 even from its own aesthetic works. The detachment implicit in SchlegePs irony, however, is not the same as the detachment from materiality empha sized in so many Hindu texts on which he would write commentaries. In fact, SchlegePs irony is ultimately in opposition to a commitment to spiritual prac tice, in the Eastern sense. Although his irony appears to embrace the para doxes of existence, it belies a personal unwillingness to invest in the sort of self-examination that would cause one to change one's mind in any funda mental way, presuming that were possible. Although difficult to prove, I would argue that this is true of Schlegel and accounts to a large degree for his retreat from the apparent incommensurability of Indian and Western philos ophy to take refuge in the familiar consolations of Christianity. Most of the theoretical foundation for SchlegePs doctrine of irony is to be found in his definition of romantic literature in his 116thAthenaeums-fragment on progressive Universalpoesie, which states that Romantic poetry recognizes as its first commandment that the will of the poet can tolerate no law above it self. He claims that such poetry can be free of all self-interest, raising poetic re flection by multiplying it in an endless succession of mirrors. It seems to be precisely this endless reflecting that elevates irony, cutting off the poet from the egoless integration of personal soul with impersonal Absolute?as empha sized in the Upanishads and Bhagavad G?ta, texts that comprise the philosoph ical foundation of Sanskrit literature?and preserving an interest in the poet's material self. It may thus be no wonder that the word Ironie itself derives from the Greek eironeia meaning "dissimulation.77 Since irony consists of purport ing a meaning that is different, often opposite, to a literal one, the Romantic poet is under no obligation to commit himself. The attitude of irony?which was for Schlegel not just a literary technique but a philosophy of living?runs further risks, since the practice of Romantic irony may lead to irresponsible human actions. Although not ironic in conception, Ludwig Tieck7s protago nist William Lovell, who rapes his twin sister who then commits suicide, may be considered as a nihilist extension of the ironic tendency found in Schlegel. Schlegel takes Romantic irony (as distinguished from JuvenaPs or Jonathan Swift's) as far as Tieck, but in the direction of the demonic. Schlegel extends his philosophy of irony in search of religious salvation, which is conceived as a process of becoming. This sense of becoming would, for Schlegel as for Novalis and Schelling, derive largely from his paradoxical encounter with Indian Studies. As Michael Franklin notes in his excellent introduction to the 2001 reprint of E. J. Millington's 1849 English translation of ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier, Schlegel had begun his intellectual career as a classicist studying Sophocles and Plato in Greek, inspired by Joachim Winckelmann's emphasis on the superiority and harmony of ancient Greek civilization, yet he also shared with Herder and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing an outspoken German dis dain for the classical imitations of French Neoclassicism (viii). Indeed,</page><page sequence="6">COWAN: Friedrich Schlegel 327 Schlegel described the Latin languages as "partly dead77 and therefore deficient in creative elements. Although he had much impressed his professors at G?ttingen and Leipzig, he found that their emphasis on the capacities of the human mind lacked engagement with that which lay outside it. By 1795, his ideas about poetry were split between his denigration of modern poetry when juxtaposed to the ancient Greek, as is made clear, on the one hand, in his essay "?ber das Studium der griechischen Poesie,77 and on the other, in his anticipa tion of the vindication of Romantic poetry. In 1797, Schlegel read Georg Forster 7s Sakontala, the first German transla tion of Kalidasa7s Abhijn?nas?kuntalam. Although he had been critical of Herder's interpretation of Indian sources prior to this, Herder's commentary on the play and the general enthusiasm for it in the German principalities stimulated SchlegeLs interest in Indian literature. SchlegeLs meeting with Orientalist Friedrich Majer in Jena in 1800 would prove even more profound, inspiring him to pursue the study of Sanskrit itself. When he shared the revela tion of Sakontala with his brother, August Wilhelm blamed Napoleon for delaying the arrival of Sanskrit in Europe. It was the Peace of Amiens (1802), however, that brought to Paris the man who would become SchlegeLs San skrit teacher, the British scholar Alexander Hamilton (first cousin of the American statesman). Schlegel had first moved to Paris with Dorothea Veit, the daughter of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, to study Persian with the Orientalist Antoine-L?onard de Ch?zy. Hamilton had been, like Frie driche and August Wilhelm7s brother, Karl August Schlegel, an army officer of the East India Company, as well as a member of the Asiatick Society of Bengal founded by William Jones. He had married a Bengali woman and begun cata loguing the Indian manuscripts that had worked their way into the Biblio th?que Nationale over the preceding decades. Within a few years, the focal point of Indian Studies would thus shift to Paris from London, where it had arrived from Calcutta. Even prior to his Sanskrit studies in Paris, both Schlegel brothers wrote articles for their quarterly Athen?um that reflected their enthusiastic support of the virtues of Sanskrit language and literature. Friedrich, in "Gespr?ch ?ber die Poesie,7' argues that the treasures of South Asian literature should be as accessible as those of Greek and Roman antiquity, viewing India as the source of Universalpoesie. In an essay entitled "Die Sprachen,77 August Wilhelm de scribes the grammatical perfection of Sanskrit as the language of heaven, its characters having been designed by God himself. The term deva- (god) in the name of one of the scripts in which Sanskrit is written, Devanagari1 is indica tive of the belief in India itself that the syllabary was bestowed upon human beings by a deity. Peter K. J. Park has argued recently that SchlegeLs ?ber die Sprache is the apology of a Catholic convert, and that "with the theory of degeneration, Schlegel and other Christian thinkers could account for the heathen peoples of</page><page sequence="7">328 Fhe German Quarterly Summer 2008 Asia and the New World using the Bible's historical scheme and still retain the view of monogenesis" (91, 93). Indeed, SchlegePs conversion to Catholicism seems to have been coming for several years, and the composition of this text in 1806-07 appears coincident with his feeling that Asian thought, so strayed in its contemporary form from primordial revelation, now threatened Chris tianity, the sole remaining manifestation of that original unity. As Park notes, ?ber die Sprache is the fifth intellectual history of mankind and the second cri tique of all philosophy that Schlegel wrote during his time in Cologne, each in the service of his emerging Christian faith. II. Manifestations of the Fear of Infinity in the Text By the time Schlegel arrived at the composition of his definitive work on Sanskrit literature and Hindu philosophy, however, his love affair with India had devolved into suspicion and discord and thus his efforts resulted in a deeply conflicted work unable to reconcile Western and non-Western perspec tives. Book I of ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier, "Von der Sprache,77 presents evidence of Sanskrit's relationship with Greek, Latin, Persian, and Germanic tongues, building on William Jones's "Third Anniversary Dis course" given at the Asiatick Society in Bengal in 1786. Like Jones, Schlegel avoids drawing etymologies based on conjecture, emphasizing the roots of verbs and grammatical form, as Franklin notes (Schlegel, On the Language xii). This portion of the book received the most attention among scholars and is considered to have inaugurated the fields of "Indology" and comparative Indo-European philology in Germany Taking a lead from Herder, Schlegel believed that similar structures were indicative of not only common origin, but also common spirit. In considering that Sanskrit itself was the Indo European Ursprache rather than its descendant, however, Schlegel was respon sible for an error that Jones had avoided making. Sanskritist Madhav Deshpande notes such errors in assuming origins are to some extent due to the fact that pre-500-BC Vedic is largely incomprehensible and that European Indologists were easily misled in trying to find in it cognates with European languages because of ancient Vedic7s plethora of regional folk etymologies (Deshpande, Interview). Schlegel advocates in his preface that the study of Indian literature should be embraced by teachers and students to the extent to which Greco-Roman culture ignited scholars in Germany and Italy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, using the term "Oriental Renaissance77 that he had coined in 1803. Schlegel predicts that a short time invested in the study of Indian culture in the nineteenth century, with energy equal to that expended in the Renais sance, would prove no less grand and universal for the European mind. He argues that the form of all wisdom and science, and almost of the world itself,</page><page sequence="8">COWAN: Friedrich Schlegel 329 would be changed and renovated by the influence of knowledge that will be understood as not new but re-awakened. He states that the structure of San skrit indicates a clear and profound understanding of human consciousness early in the history of mankind, for the Indian language, ... die selbst in ihren ersten und einfachsten Bestandtheilen die h?chsten Begriffe der reinen Gedankenwelt, gleichsam den ganzen Grundri? des Bewu?tseins nicht bildlich, sondern in unmittelbarer Klarheit ausdr?ckt. (Schlegel, ?ber die Sprache 169) Die? feine Gef?hl mu?te dann mit der Sprache selbst zugleich auch Schrift her vorbringen; keine hieroglyphische nach ?u?ern Naturgegenst?nden mahlende oder bildernde, sondern eine solche, welche den innern Charakter der Buchsta ben, wie er so deutlich gef?hlt wird, nun auch in sichtlichen Umri?en hinstellte und bezeichnete. (Schlegel, ?ber die Sprache 151) Schlegel finishes the section by stating that scarcely any language in the world can be found, no matter how geographically or culturally remote, in which German does not have roots, thus exemplifying the great distances of the mi grations of the Teutonic race, or, one might say, his subscription to a good deal of lazy argument by analogy. It is Book II, "Von der Philosophie,77 however, that may ultimately prove to be the more influential portion of the work, for here we see the "fear of infin ity77 laid bare. Here SchlegePs attempts objectively to survey the cyclical na ture of Indian philosophy, with its puzzling voids between cycles, are over shadowed by his growing Christian sentiments and their emphasis on rectolinearity. He goes on to develop the theme of the beauty and antiquity of Sanskrit and of its aptitude for expressing philosophical ideas. His writings now, however, begin to belie his mistrust of the philosophical systems he uncovers. He maintains that the ancient Hindus possessed knowledge of the true God, but that an original revelation had been obscured and sullied by pan theism, polytheism, and the Indian system of emanation (the theory that all derived or secondary things flow from the primary), producing fatalism, determinism, moral stupefaction, and intellectual indolence. The optimism and belief in universal progress that he reveals in Book I, gives way to a dis course of deterioration in Book II. Franklin notes that this may be a result, in part, of the fact that the Indian Puranic tradition, which is part of the philoso phy he treats, itself saw the world as subject to a process of progressive deteri oration (Schlegel, On the Language xiii).1 In reading Sanskrit literature, Schlegel tends to see only the emphasis on the Shaivic, the destructive, and this not as part of a cycle of decay and re-emergence, but as an end in itself. In his discussion of the Manusmriti [The Law Book of Manu], for example, Schlegel argues that in the ancient cosmog ony of Manu one already finds traces of materialism, a clue for tracing the progress of degeneracy from spiritual ideas to an entirely materialist</page><page sequence="9">330 The German Quarterly Summer 2008 worldview. He argues that in all the ancient Indian texts, one witnesses the "primitive error77 of mistaking man, the "blind and senseless instrument77 of di vinity, for the free operation and comprehension of divine truth. He finds that the most important periods of Indian, and indeed of all Asian, philosophy and religion are the periods that see the diffusion of the doctrine of emanation, which eventually degenerates into astrological superstition and fanatic mate rialism, and the doctrine of dualism, which is eventually transformed into pantheism. He argues that among all the systems of philosophy to have come out of Asia, none are so positively of Indian origin or as old as the doctrines of emanation and metempsychosis (Pythagoras's theory that the souls of ani mals traveled into the bodies of other animals after death): Wo diese Seelenwanderung nicht blo? physisch gemeint, sondern mit der Mei nung von der moralischen Verderbni? und Unseeligkeit aller Wesen, und not wendigen Reinigung und R?ckkehr zu Gott verbunden ist, da ist sie sicher aus diesem System entlehnt, und also indischen Ursprungs. Auf diese Weise finden wir in der Lehre des Pythagoras den Begriff der Metempsychose mit allen seinen orientalischen Nebenbestimmungen zum sichern Beweise, da? es keine helleni sche Erfindung war, obgleich bald hernach mit hellenischem Geist und Scharf sinn angeeignet und umgebildet;... (Schlegel, ?ber die Sprache 213) This is a renewal of arguments made by Hellenistic and Roman writers, such as Megasthenes, Arrian, Strabo, and Philostratus, that the most ancient sages of Greece?notably Pythagoras and Plato, not to mention the god Dionysus himself?had in fact been taught their philosophies by Brahmin priests in India. Schlegel oscillates in Book II between discussions of emanation, metem psychosis, dualism, pantheism, immorality, and materialism. It is almost as if his disbelief in the "errors77 in these texts he is treating keeps him from being able to discuss one issue exhaustively before moving on to the next. He finds that the doctrine of emanation can be understood most favorably when con sidered as a system of reunion with the divine essence, in which the divine origin of man is continually inculcated to stimulate and animate his efforts to return, and incites him to consider a reunion and re-incorporation with divin ity as the one primary object of every action and exertion. He goes on to state, however, that the doctrine of emanation is intelligible only as a perverted con ception of revealed truth. Schlegel traces the play of positive and negative forces in the earliest forms of Indian pantheism to the later alterations and "debasement77 of dualism, arguing that pantheism leads to the rejection of the difference between right and wrong. But he argues that with the doctrine of emanation, the world is mistakenly viewed as degraded and that as a result only the realm of the Creator is divine bliss. He finds that the persistence of such an erroneous notion is due to its systematic connections throughout Hinduism, as is true with Hindu conceptions of what it means to break the cycle of material re-birth, which Schlegel mistakenly refers to as "immortal</page><page sequence="10">COWAN: Friedrich Schlegel 331 ity.77 Immortality is not construed here as Christian heaven, but as a delusion created by the idea that one can transform one's existence. The idea that there are states of existence between material incarnations is discarded out of hand. Schlegel derives the "demoralization" of divinity from an overemphasis on the decay of the material, falling in line with the tradition among Roman his torians, such as Arrian and Philostratus, of associating Shiva with Dionysus: In der aus sehr verschiedenen Bestandtheilen zusammengesetzten und durch manche Stufen allm?hlig gebildeten Religion der Indier, nimmt die Anbetung der wilden Naturkraft aber eine nur allzu gro?e Stelle ein. Bald als allvernichtende Zerst?rung aufgefa?t, bald als Zeugungskraft der Natur als eines unendlichen Thieres, bietet uns der Dienst des Sivo, und [Gemahl Shivas] der furchtbare Dur ga, Bilder des Todes und der Wollust, blutige Menschenopfer und bakchantische Z?gellosigkeit in einem grauseen Gemisch dar. Was diesen Naturdienst und Materialismus so schrecklich macht, und von der blo?en Sinnlichkeit mancher V?lker um Zustande der einfachsten Wildheit noch so sehr unterscheidet, d?rfte gerade die beigemischte und ?berall einverwebte Idee des Unendlichen sein, die noch auf den bessern Ursprung zur?ck deutet; denn grade das H?chste und Edelste wird immer, wenn es verwildert und entartet, zur schrecklichsten Misge stalt. (Schlegel, ?ber die Sprache 223) He argues that a similar veneration of the physical strength and vigor of na ture was vital to Greco-Roman mythology, although it was not systematized throughout their religious beliefs in so fully developed and interconnected a form. Taking his lead from Herodotus, he also reaches back to the intermedi ary Egyptians to explain that the suffering god Osiris is best explained by reference to the Indian belief in the misery of the natural world, and the deep degradation in which its original light and purity had become involved.2 Schlegel writes that the peculiar affinity of Indian and European idealism consists principally in the opinion that activity, life, and freedom can alone be recognized as actually effective in their operation, and that inertia and inactiv ity are condemned as utterly void and ineffective. He cannot accept the idea that the move out of materiality is a necessary part of a process, that the space in between is not, in fact, a meaningless void. He ignores any emphasis not only on the Vaishnavic (the subtle essence that maintains life and that con cerned Schelling), but on the Brahmanic (the creative element that Arthur Schopenhauer will emphasize3) in Sanskrit literature, conceding in his only mention of the Puranas that they emphasize the role of Vishnu: Es ist das erste System, das an die Stelle der Wahrheit trat; wilde Erdichtungen und grober Irrthum, aber ?berall noch Spuren der g?ttlichen Wahrheit und der Ausdruck jenes Schrektens und jener Betr?bni?, die der erste Abfall von Gott zur Folge haben mu?te. (Schlegel, ?ber die Sprache 209) He seems to feel, echoing Georges Buffon's ideas about the lost wisdom of the first society, that Indian thought is still reeling from this initial loss (106).</page><page sequence="11">332 The German Quarterly Summer 2008 Schlegel argues that the idea of the absence of any specific design in the cre ation of the world, of a merely capricious activity on the part of the Creator, is intimately connected with that of an alternation and revolution that he sees as ceaseless. Schlegel argues that in Asian countries (other than China, which he still finds to be pantheistic) Buddhist doctrines are drawn from the worship of Shiva in particular. This belief appears to be based on his own inference, for he finds the practices of the Yogis and Buddhist teachers to be "spirit-crushing martyrdom,77 apparently like that of Shaivic devotees. It is unclear, however, what Buddhist texts he has read, and indeed by 1808 the Pali canon had yet to be translated by Western scholars. He expects that Buddhism is a doctrine destined not to last, for it supposes every object in creation to be thus nullified and absorbed into an abstract and negative conception of the eternal. Schlegel sees no similarity between unity of substance, unity of absence, and the power of an almighty, anthropomorphic God, for he is searching for Eastern analogues to Western conceptions, rather than attempting to understand Hinduism on its own terms. At the end of Book II, Schlegel marks both the philosophical link he sees between Asia and Europe and the apparent problem of belief in religions that emphasize the transcendence of material form: Alle andre orientalische Lehrbegriffe gr?nden und berufen sich noch auf g?ttli che Wunder und Offenbarung, so entstellt auch alles durch Fabel und Irrthum sein mag. Der Pantheismus ist das System der reinen Vernunft, und insofern macht er schon den ?bergang von der orientalischen Philosophie zur europ?i schen. Er schmeichelt dem Eigend?nkel des Menschen eben so sehr als seiner Tr?gheit. Ist einmal diese gro?e Entdeckung gemacht, diese alles umfassende, alles vernichtende, und doch so leichte Wissenschaft und Vernunft-Weisheit, da? Alles Eins sei, gefunden, so bedarf es weiter keines Suchens und Forschens; alles was andre auf andren Wegen wissen oder glauben, ist nur Irrthum, T?u schung und Verstandesschw?che, so wie alle Ver?nderung und alles Leben ein leerer Schein. (Schlegel, ?ber die Sprache 243) How the concept of unity inevitably leads one into the abyss of intolerance, however, is unclear. In Book III, "Historische Ideen,77 L?on Poliakov claims that Schlegel depicts Indian sages descending from the Himalaya to found empires that would civi lize the West (192). While this is overstated, Schlegel does argue that the most powerful nations of the globe sprang from one Indian stock and that the gene alogy that leads to Germanic peoples is obvious: Gesetz also, nicht blo? der ?ussere Drang der Not, sondern irgend ein wunderba rer Begriff von der hohen W?rde und Herrlichkeit des Nordens, wie wir ihn in den indischen Sagen ?berall verbreitet finden, habe sie nordw?rts gef?hrt, so w?rde sich der Weg der Germanischen St?mme von Turkhind l?ngst dem Gihon</page><page sequence="12">COWAN: Friedrich Schlegel 333 bis zur Nordseite des caspischen Meers und des Kaukasus leicht nachweisen las sen. (Schlegel, ?ber die Sprache 293) Such tribes would then follow the rivers that would lead them to Europe. Schlegel feels that comparative grammar decides once and for all that San skrit is the oldest Indo-European language and mother of all others in that group, particularly Gothic and Anglo-Saxon. More recently it has been argued by Deshpande and Peter Edwin Hook, however, that Sanskrit itself bears many historical influences, especially from the Dravidian languages of the South (3). We might remember that in the R?may?na, Rama is described as the conqueror of wild Southern tribes, who absorbs their culture, much like the historical "Aryans.77 The epithet "Aryan,77 which became so deeply ingrained in Nazi ideology, was first used in the Rig Veda1 in which the Dasas are described as the dark-skinned enemies of the light-skinned Aryas. In Europe, the term was first used by Herodotus and was resurrected by India scholar Anquetil Duperron just prior to the birth of Romanticism to designate an original, belli cose people of Northern India who subjugated the tribes of the Indian South. This vision of a unified Aryan people persisted at least into the 1930s. Con temporary scholars, however, now envisage the supposed "invasion77 of the In dian subcontinent by "the Aryans77 as actually a slow seepage of pastoral tribes of ethnically diverse speakers of several related Indo-Aryan languages that mi grated to India from the Levant. III. Impact of the Work Aside from SchlegeLs decidedly problematic anthropological assump tions, for which he has been justifiably faulted, the intent of SchlegeLs book was in keeping with the tendency among the German Romantics, so re marked upon by Berman, to infuse philosophy, mythology, mystical theology, and poetry into linguistic questions. Schlegel ultimately fails to locate, how ever, the unity and purity he sought in ancient Indian culture, emphasizing in Book III that he finds in the Judeo-Christian tradition a more convincing elaboration of the original wisdom of India. Despite this defect, Schlegel has received acclaim as the founder of the comparative enterprise of linguistic typology, particularly for his work in ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier. Schlegel argues in Book I that there is a distinct difference between organic, inflected languages, such as Sanskrit or Greek, and mechanical, non-inflected languages, an argument that runs parallel to August Wilhelm's distinction between organic and mechanical form in his celebrated lectures, Vorlesungen ?ber sch?ne Eiter atur und Kunst (1804). Franklin notes that the cultural-political implications of SchlegeLs discrimination between organic and mechanical languages ensured that his term "Indo-Germanic77 was destined to become</page><page sequence="13">334 Fhe German Quarterly Summer 2008 more than a term indicating a particular type of linguistic interest (Schlegel, On the Language xiv). Jones's "Third Anniversary Discourse" had energized linguistic and sup posedly racial interconnections between India and Germany, encouraging Schlegel to link his revival of Gothic medievalism with his claims for an Indian heritage. This has led a few twentieth-century scholars, however much some of them may themselves be slighted these days?such as Poliakov, Bernai, and Said?to charge Schlegel with racism. To make an accusation of this sort, however, despite Schlegel's anthropologically problematic third section, does not take into account the context in which the work was written. We must remember that Schlegel and the other early German India scholars relied upon the publications of the British Orientalists and that Germany was in a very different position in 1808 than was England. In terms of Orientalism, one sees in Germany quite the reverse of the English model. Germany was not coloniz ing other countries, imposing on them its own culture; it had yet to become a nation itself. Instead, "Germany," a set of loosely connected principalities each with distinct sovereignty, was experiencing forms of internal colonialism, bound up in the political climate and nationalist debates of its own scholar ship, as Pollack has noted. What is troubling about Schlegel's ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier is not that it may be construed as racist; it is that the book lays groundwork for later European scholars to view Indian thought, and Asian philosophy generally, as nihilistic. Schlegel's ?ber die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indierwas nevertheless a ma jor step in the colonization of Germany by Indian ideas. As Schwab notes, Avestan scholar James Darmesteter maintained in his Essais orientaux (1883) that he had scarcely ever seen, outside the manifesto of Joachim Du Bellay, the equivalent of Schlegel's essay in literary history (13). That is to say that, just as Du Bellay had affirmed the legitimacy of literature in the French vernacular, Darmesteter found Schlegel to have affirmed the place of German in linguistic history by associating it with the profound and ancient philosophical ideas of India. Other writers were less enthusiastic, however. As Schwab and Park also note, Johann Wilhelm von Goethe, as well as Heinrich Heine later, found Schlegel continually apologetic on Catholic grounds, and instantly criticized his book (Schwab 81, 84; Park 101). The devout interest that Goethe had shown in his youth for Biblical traditions was directed in his late years to other oriental mythologies and to the concept of Weltliteratur. His own Orientalism, however, would never travel East of Persia, as is to be seen in his West-Qstlicher Divan (1819). Since he felt no linguistic or racial affinity with the Hindus, and seems to have been disdainful of the rowdy agitation of German patriots, Goethe's observations were out of step with the younger Romantic genera tion. Schlegel, on the other hand, crystallized the German passion for the Orient that had by then been developing for almost three decades. He would in fact attempt to formulate a metaphysical epistemology that would have a</page><page sequence="14">COWAN: Friedrich Schlegel 335 profound impact on the national destiny. Schlegel thus seeks to imbue the nationalism and Indophilia that had begun with Herder with a more pro foundly personal?if misguided?spirituality. Schwab explains that Schlegel saw his book as a destined spiritual event, a confluence of his background as a German historian, his romantic veneration for an Orient whose precedents would determine the literary future of Eu rope, and, above all, his faith, which led him to choose to relate everything to religious interests (80). While Poliakov exaggerates the extent to which Schlegel fails to make distinctions between criteria of language and criteria of race, Schlegel does tend to describe national characteristics?in relation to blood, spirit, origin, race, and religion?as pure. Schlegel also emphasizes the linguistic, cultural, and racial importance of Persia in the alleged line from India to Germany. While previous European writers, such as Herodotus and Antoine-Yves Goguet, had placed Egypt or Israel between India and Germany historically, and Orientalists such as Anquetil-Duperron and Jones had em phasized the importance of Persia, SchlegeLs placement of Persia in a history that leads from India to Germany will prove influential for later thinkers, such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and, one could argue, Friedrich Nietzsche. The first enthusiastic follower of Friedrich SchlegeLs ideas was his older brother August Wilhelm, but, despite following his brother into an Indian obsession, A. W SchlegeLs interest in India seems to have been rather more inspired by their brother Karl August's travels on the subcontinent. A. W Schlegel in fact offered tribute to his elder brother's endeavors in a poem from 1787, "Bestattung des Brahminen. Eine Phantasie an meinem Bruder in Ostindien," which, as Bradley Herling notes, proved eerily prophetic in its evocation of premature death (A. Schlegel 159). With Friedrich SchlegeLs eventual abandonment of Sanskrit literature for Christianity, it would be August Wilhelm who would hold the first German chair in the subject, at the University of Bonn, beginning in 1818. His publication of the Indische Bibliothek (1820-1830) contained articles by scholars such as Franz Bopp and other later English scholars of India. August Wilhelm's contributions to Ger man Indian Studies proved sound, with fewer of the incendiary and mistaken notions to be found in his brother's 1808 work. Conclusion Germaine De Sta?l's overpraise of the Germans in De TAllemagne (1810), a cultural history that praised the work of Herder and was to determine what France thought about Germany until the two countries went to war in 1870, is to some extent surprising since both Schlegel brothers were such outspoken critics of French Neoclassicism. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, when the linguistic and cultural patriotism of their countrymen was trans</page><page sequence="15">336 Fhe German Quarterly Summer 2008 forming itself into a kind of Pan-Germanism, Friedrich Schlegel wrote?as thinkers like Eberlin von Gunzberg, Herder, and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock had already argued?that Europe owed everything to the Germanic migra tions. By 1819, Schlegel was using the term "Aryan," as had Anquetil Duperron, connecting the Sanskrit root arya ("noble") with the German word Ehre ("honor"). Yet, the very linguistic scholars whom Schlegel's work had in spired, such as Franz Bopp, disputed the term indo-germanisch, preferring in do-europ?isch. For the Jena Romantics?in particular, Novalis, Schelling, and Friedrich Schlegel?Christianity still held answers that Hinduism and Buddhism could not provide. In the end, the ideas of Asian religions, though endowed with pri mordial characteristics, only figure as precursors to the true answers to be found in the New Testament. Ultimately, questions with which they had ini tially been concerned, such as whether doctrines like metempsychosis were closer to the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza than to that of Immanuel Kant, became moot as their unbridled enthusiasm for an alternative to Greece and Rome brought them back to Judea. Through the course of this journey, how ever, Friedrich Schlegel had done much to perpetuate the idea that Hindu and Buddhist philosophy eventually leads into the meaningless void. Notes 1 The Puranic tradition stems from the teachings of the Upanishads, that is, of Vedanta, but using the Puranas, a popularized version of Vedanta. The Darsanas, or schools of Hindu philosophy, are strict, esoteric, and meant only for the learned Brah min caste. The Puranas are meant for the masses with supposedly inferior intellects. The aim of the Puranas is to impress on the minds of the masses the teachings of the Upanishads and to generate in them devotion to God through concrete examples: myths; parables; legends; lives of saints, kings and great men; allegories and chronicles of major historical events. Among the large number o?puranas, eighteen are considered major pur anas, six of which are addressed to Vishnu, six to Brahma, and six to Shiva. In the "Shiva-Purana,77 Shiva is elegised, the importance of the decaying part of the cycle of existence is emphasized, and an inferior, often belittling, position is given to Vishnu. The opposite is true in the "Vishnu-Purana,77 which emphasizes that the tamasic, the Shaivic, is to be avoided. Of particular importance for Schlegel is the fact that in the "Vishnu-Purana77 the pursuit of positive forces such as the Buddha, enlightenment, and superiority are constantly juxtaposed with negative forces such as monsters, the demonic, and the void. 2 See Herodotus 2.42, 2.123, 2.144. 3 See Robert Bruce Cowan, "Nietzsche's Attempted Escape from Schopenhauer's South Asian Sources in Fhe Birth ofFragedy."
