It is not a question of the quantity of applicants but of the quality of their rights. Religionists are asked for the founda- tion of the rights of strangers, because the roots of these rights reach into the archaic past, when there was not yet a state with institutionalized laws ("Rechtsstaat"). The treatment of the stranger was both in (2) Ancient Israel and (3) Ancient Greece the test of the righteousness of the people. Not the exact and continuing performance of the cult of the Gods demonstrates the piety of the people, but the treatment of the poor and weak. In pre-state societies the right of the strongest does not rule. However, the pride of the citizens and the token of the richness of a city is the granting of protection to outcasts. The sacrality of the holy place ("sanctuary") does not automatically grant protection. The talk of divine protection enables the protectors to gain the advantage of wide acceptance which compensates for a deficit of actual power. (4) Human rights have to be defended against attempts of political administra- tions to cut them short, that is, in consequence: to take away an individual's right to enjoy asylum. 1. Asylum as a Test of the Founding of Human Rights 1.1 The right of asylum is more important today than ever before. There are at least 15 million refugees in the world today (not counting so-called economic refugees, like "boat-peoples" or "Scheinasylanten"). The economic power of the northern, industrialized nations stifles the economies of the southern nations. Furthermore, people of the Third World are terrorized and restrained by advanced weapons, eagerly proffered by the North to solvent tyrants. Consequently, the rights of asylum have gained compelling actuality today.</page><page sequence="2">194 Christoph Auffarth We must review the justification of these rights particularly when the affluent nations curtail the general validity and the generosity of the right of asylum through extraordinary legal measures and close their borders to those seeking protection. Germany (to speak only of her) today increasingly rejects asylum applictions. Although, to avoid charges of inhumanity, Germany does not deport the rejected applicants. This exposes the dilemma between the legality and the legitimacy of human rights. 1.2 Like other human rights, rights of asylum stem not from positive state rights. They protect the individual against prerogatives nations have claimed for themselves. Therefore, human rights are inalienable (that means, men possess them like they possess their life) and must not be curtailed.' The rights of asylum belong not to those individual rights won through political emancipation, but belong to social human rights.2 Surprisingly, they were recognized for the first time as basic rights in 1948 by the United Nations. However, even in the non-binding Charter of the United Nations asylum is not considered a human right. By a slight change of wording the human rights of asylum, which the political persecuted possess, were transformed into rights that can be granted by nations. The German constitutional law (Grundgesetz) however in Arti- cle 16 Paragraph 2 (2) grants the right of asylum to everybody who is persecuted for political reasons. It states: "Politisch Verfolgte genie1en Asylrecht".4 This far-reaching formulation was motivated by the experiences of the mothers and fathers of constitu- tional law because many of them had enjoyed protection from Nazi tyranny themselves.5 In this respect asylum rights are utilitarian. It was then even more utilitarian because in the recent past Jews applying for asylum in Switzerland had been rejected because courts determined that they were persecuted not for political reasons, but were simply looking for protection from their murderers who had acted out of racist or religious reasons.6 To put it pointedly the rights of asylum are conceived as rights granted by politicians to other politicians.7 The human rights of the French Revolution did not include a right of asylum, because this right was a claim of the feudal powers,</page><page sequence="3">Protecting Strangers 195 which excluded some people from general and universal justice. By immunity specific people were secure in ecclasiastical spaces where secular powers did not extend.8 It was unnecessary to distinguish seperate rights for dissenters in the United States because America itself was in fact an asylum for all those who could or would not obey secular powers of absolutistic European states.9 In Europe, the right of asylum was, however, an urgent necessity, since the volontle generale was defined by exclusively one person and the revolution was transformed into a reign of terror (the terreur). On one side, asylum was touted as a political attraction for exiled peers. The other side attracted exiled citoyens. It turned out not to be a human right, because it was valid only beyond the borders. In this case the discussions, if human rights originated in the age of Enlightment o or if they had non-secular origins in the age of reformation," miss the point: asylum rights follow an archaic, pre- Christian and pre-state tradition. Both of the mentioned theories take pride in the advance of justice,'2 but, when considering rights of asylum, there is really no justification for a belief in progressive development of law. 1.3 The Sanctuary movement in the United States justified its illegal actions by appealing to the biblical institution of asylum and the right of the church to grant asylum at the altar (sanctuary), whenever political refugees from Central America were hidden and moved from church to church.'~ The older stage in the evolution of the asylum law seemed to have survived, but now gains new importance. Religionists have often explained (and some continue to do so) the significance of an altar as safe refuge for those seeking asylum through its capacity for radiating sacral power. 4 Is Otto Kimminich right when he conceived a sacral-magic stage of asylum'5 which had been superseded by an utilitarian and then a legal stage? 6 Another current model of rights of strangers imputes that pre- state societies perceived strangers as hostile, who not only could be but must be killed. However, an exception of this general rule is the guest and friend. He is honoured to such an extent that the host may even surrender his wife for the night. Pre-state societies were, as it is maintained, essentially xenophobic or even racist. This</page><page sequence="4">196 Christoph Auffarth model is widely accepted among (German) historians following Carl Schmitt, who regarded the dichotomy of friend/enemy as the substance of politics and war and as the only case that all politics is aiming at: the serious case (Ernstfall). This dichotomy is especially fatal in the case of asylum for here one claims a right not in favor of friends or native, but for strangers, i.e. enemies.7 In opposition to such undemocratic explanations and regarding the historical and contemporary claims of human rights, I shall undertake an investigation of asylum and its function in pre-state societies and early civilizations in Israel and Greece. 2. Protecting Strangers in Israel 2.1. Abraham and the Destruction of Sodom In the book of Genesis one reads the stirring story of Abraham trying to save the city of Sodom and his beseeching God to spare the city because of the righteous.'" However, even the smallest number he could imagine was set too high. In Sodom, one could not even find ten righteous people. God had only tested their morals. The test was not whether or not they committed thievery, deceived one another, mistreated their wives and their servants or committed murder. He was not even concerned if they were devout and fulfilled their religious duties. Hospitality toward strangers was the true test. Three strangers first visit Abraham, the nomad,'9 who receives them with utmost kindness. In return the three strangers assure the couple, who are now old and sterile, that they will soon receive a child. Leaving Abraham, the three continue on their way. Arriving in the town they are invited or, indeed, compelled by Lot, the nephew of Abraham, to accept his hospitality in his home. Shortly, a group of townsmen form in front of Lot's house and threateningly demand to see the guests, implying that they desire sexual intercourse with them. Lot refuses to turn over the strangers. Indeed he offers his unmarried daughters to the group. He implores the men of Sodom to leave his three guests in peace (Gen. 19, 8): "since that is the reason why they came under the protection of my roof".20 A small punishing miracle saves the</page><page sequence="5">Protecting Strangers 197 guests. God destroys the world of the Sodomites while sparing the few righteous because the townsmen betrayed the laws of hospitality and mistreated guests. Indeed, this account may be just an anecdote, one may call it an itinerant story,21 which was woven into tales about the patriarchs. Later, in the time of the Jewish exile,22 it was once again revised. Then it explained, how the catastrophe of the Jewish exile could have happened in spite of the righteous people among the exiled. This tale is, however, grounded in reality: Although I don't mean, as the Rabbis like to relate, that Abraham built a hotel aside the road for the numerous guests, who had heard of his hospitality (thereby founding Israeli tourism).23 The narrative deals with a social problem, namely, the protection of strangers. Whereas in olden times towns flourished which disregarded the laws of hospitality, there exists now only lifeless desert where salt prevents the growth of vegetation and the Dead Sea extends over the rest.24 The etiology confirms the message of the story. This message represents one of the few early ethical commandments directly con- nected with the cult of Gods.25 Whoever honors the Gods in cult has also to care for strangers and the impoverished. Gods are not believed to be identical with their cult-images. Instead they are anthropomorphic and cannot be distinguished in principle from human beings."26 Disguised as the disadvantaged of society, the Gods test the piety of those who claim to honor them. The laws of hospitality can be respected only by the host.27 There is no utilitarian reason for this, there is no sacral object that radiates or symbolizes divine power. The world of the Sodomites was destroyed through their unethical actions. Their behavior is the social chaos; the natural Chaos is therefore only the inevitable con- sequence of the former. The actions of God were not arbitrary (anger of an offended God). God establishes in nature what men had established in their social world: disorder and Chaos.28 Con- versely, as the prophets of the exile expressed, a nation can "turn back" to justice, thus enabling a new creation: Ezekiel envisions in his utopia or plan for a constitution (47, 8-12) how the fresh water river rises from the Jerusalem temple. It transforms the Dead Sea into a lush oasis.29 The concrete determinations of law repeatedly contain special</page><page sequence="6">198 Christoph Auffarth regulations for protecting strangers.30 They do not begin in time of exile, which could be inferred from the conditions of a pariah-class. The statement "... you had been strangers in Egypt" is not utilitarian in the sense of the Golden Rule (we could face the same situation ourselves). This statement is found in the oldest collection of laws in Israel, in the "book of Covenant" (Ex 22, 20), which reflects a world of free and sedentary peasant communities.31 More- over it grounds the protection of the stranger with a deed that God performed first. This is the same form as in a prayer in which one begs: "Help me, because I experienced your help already!" 2.2 Fleeing to God's Protection: Is there a Sacral-Magic Asylum in Israel? Establishing kingship in Israel quickly concentrated economic power; thereby increasing the temptation to disregard the rights of the disadvantaged. The kings secured, like their neighbor kings, royal privilege by sacralizing their power.32 Resisting these attempts, Yahweh's authority and power provide rectification.33 Nathan conveys the word of God, which discloses the adultery and the secret murder of King David (2 Sam 11). King David spon- taneously repents. Elijah succeeds by the word of God in revising the murder conviction-which after a regular court proceeding according to the principles of the laws of state carried a death- sentence-by obtaining the public repentance of the king (1 Kings 21). These are two instances of how older pre-state regulations of justice could be asserted against the rights of the more powerful and even the force of kings.34 The classic prophets repeatedly call upon the name of Yahweh for protecting the helpless.35 Also, the collec- tions of laws, as the book of Covenant, attest to an administration of justice from within the communities, not influenced by the king's power.36 Any claims about the violation of rights have to be reported and scheduled for a public debate. Then the claims must be asserted in the debate. The control of public and the rule of just proportion, known as the rule of talion (i.e. only one tooth can be demanded for one tooth) prevent private justice from slipping into private revenge or plundering. There is no public punishment because there is no central power of the state. Especially significant is the administration concerning cases of violent death.37 To avoid</page><page sequence="7">Protecting Strangers 199 death himself the man who slaughtered another man must escape to an asylum. In this case the altar is explicitly mentioned. If the sanctuary is reached, then the accused is safe from an immediate execution by private justice.38 If the accused can prove that he killed without malice, then the asylum can protect him from being executed. Two arguments can be made against the view that it is the sacral power of the altar that protects strangers (as a rule one looks for asylum in a foreign city): 39 The first argument sees an exception in the regulations of the book of Covenant: He who stands as killing with deceptive malice (becarmah) can be pulled away from the altar and can be executed (Ex 21, 14).40 Acting with deceptive malice transgresses a ground rule of pre-state societies: Struggles between equals in public are allowed, but advantages cannot be gained through secrecy and deception."4' This regulation has nothing to do with the sacredness of the altar. The second argument is based on the institution of the city- asylum. Besides the asylum in the Jerusalem temple, which is men- tioned many times in the Psalms,42 the Torah provides several cities equally distributed through the country that also offer protection to refugees. In this case not sacredness but the accessibility of the asylum is the criterion.43 Let us review the facts: Not every altar can grant asylum. Cities must be specially determined in order to be asylums. Asylum does not protect everyone. These observations support the thesis that asylum is a positive right, and not a sacral- magic power. The asylum functions of an altar can be perceived in an analogy to the protection of a stranger in a house.44 A com- parison with ancient Greece corroborates this conclusion. 3. Protecting the Stranger in Archaic Greece 3.1 Odysseus and Theoklymenos In early Greece one finds the itinerant legend of the disguised Gods, who test the morals of the people by observing how they treat strangers. That is actually a recurrent theme in the Odyssey. How- ever, it is not just a literary motif of an Oriental story. Significantly, the motif (that those who are received with hospitality</page><page sequence="8">200 Christoph Auffarth are Gods) does not culminate in its cultic conclusion.45 There are disguised Gods in the Odyssey, to whom, however, this motif is not applied.'46 Instead, the tests of justice include the widow Penelope, the orphan Telemachos, the wandering beggar Odysseus. Their treatment divides the righteous, like the old servant and swineherd Eumaios, from the sacrilegious. It is not a cultic transgression that makes the sacrilegious (aX&amp;A ~oL), but their mistreatment of these strangers.47 In addition to the beggar, this is exemplified by a refugee who killed another man unintentionally. He, the seer Theoklymenos, flees to the protection of Telemachos,48 but thereby on the island of Ithaca he falls into the hands of the suitors, who cruelly insult him and harm him, like they harm his protector himself. Before he leaves the house finally, he has a vision of the impending downfall of the suitors in a cosmic catastrophe.49 To protect the stranger was an acute necessity in Early Greece: Overnight wealthy shipowners and merchants could become beg- gars through shipwreck. This fate is exemplified by Odysseus during his wanderings. Several times he loses all his wealth and his ships. Having lost even the last of his clothes he drifts ashore on the island of the Phaeacians. Since they are proverbial xenophobics,50 he is in great danger of being returned to the stormy winter seas. Through well-planned actions he succeeds in being received as a refugee and he enjoys their generous hospitalty. In the palace of the king he sits down on the hearth. However, this is not what saved him, although this hearth maybe was the sacral center of the house. The deciding action is to embrace the knees (youvi&amp;ELv) of the queen in the stereotyped gesture of the refugee (Hiketes). Thereby he comes under the protection of the woman of the house-women have the right to grant asylum in their own house.5' Consequently, he is received as a refugee by the entire community. The exact opposite occurs in the cave of Polyphemos. It is explicitly stated that Odysseus set foot on the island to test the people.52 The giant turns out to be a cannibal. When Odysseus requests a token of hospitality for himself, the ogre answers cynically that his gift is that he will eat him last. The giant ignores the warning that Zeus, the protector of the refugees (xiatoS),53 will punish him. By a trick Odysseus succeeds in blinding the ogre and</page><page sequence="9">Protecting Strangers 201 escaping from the prison of the cave. The Cyclops, not being a bar- barian, knew the law of hospitality-a right, that could be applied for all over the then known world-but almost being an animal, he ignored the right of a stranger: The poet ascribes this ignorance to his disregard of the Gods. For our questions, the ending of the story is especially interesting: Odysseus conquered the Cyclops only through his own cunning without the help of a miracle or other action on the part of the Gods. Odysseus shouts to the Cyclops from safe distance that he was blinded as a punishment of Zeus ixiatoS for having disregarded the rights of hospitality.54 Not until then does he reveal his true name. Thereby he turns cunning secrecy into the publicity of heroic fairness. Later, this brings him both glory and suffering. Likewise, the punishment of the suitors is confirmed. Odysseus is victorious in spite of their superior strength without using trickery and without help. Penelope can understand that this must have been done by a God. Again, no God brought punishment, again only men were at work.55 At the very end of the epic, the Odyssey tells about an intervention of God: 56 As the relatives of the suitors seeking revenge on Odysseus57 who murdered their sons, a few men back up Odysseus by arguing that he wouldn't be able to kill all the suitors against the will of the Gods (444-446). His deed was justified by the sacrilege of the suitors (454-462). Most of those, who came for revenge, agree and return home. Only a few are not convinced. The spiral of vendetta threatens to continue. In this situation the Gods intervene. A struggle ensues, but only one, the father of the worst suitor, is killed. Suddenly Athena appears and demands an end to the shedding of blood. The enemies flee. This just incites Odysseus all the more and he charges after the men. What began as punishment now turns into revenge; Odysseus has violated the limit ofjustice. Before he can turn the punishment into murder, Zeus stops him with a thunderbolt. Then, after taking an oath, both parties promise to return to peace.58 The case, when things get serious (der Ernstfall), is here the peace. The enemy is he who in spite of warnings59 transgresses against the order agreed by all and he who harms the weaker members. The weak are exemplified by the strangers. They especially must be protected. If they come into the protection of a</page><page sequence="10">202 Christoph Auffarth family then they receive the status of a close relative (&amp;vti x(XaLyv~ilTou).60 In this system of regulations of conflicts within communities there are no sacral-magic centers of power, that trouble the network of the equality of the heads of families, who voluntarily give up their claim of using force against the weaker ones, even less sacral kings. Punishment is executed by those who are injured by private justice under the eyes, that means controlled by the others in public, after the claims are put and discussed in public debate, then accepted by the majority. The ethical principles of this order are communicated by myths of the Gods.61 3.2 Hikesia und Asylum.: Becoming a Positive Right in States Up to now I have spoken about Hikesia, in the exact Greek term. Strangers were protected not by touching a sacred object or reaching a sacred place but only through the good will of a woman if in a home or of a man of the community if outside the home. The Gods are involved only when reasons for doing something are not by itself clear. I want to stress that before the institution of laws- that is, before their codification and the establishment of legal proceedings-norms of pre-state communities were regularly presented through narrative accounts. These stories claimed a right of strangers (that means a subject's human right) to be protected which transcended community boundaries.62 To say it pointedly, it is the system of bilateral treaties-in the following period of codificated laws-in which the bounds of the validity of the laws were established, that creates regions of lawlessness, where the strangers are not protected. Hikesia conforms to a psycho-biological ritual of bonding (Band- stiftung) when the Hiketes embraces the knees of the potential pro- tector (youvestv).63 Here one should recall that in animal ethology ritual is a socially communicated code that has to be grounded and realized for each new situation. In humans this means that gestures are understood inter-culturally, but must be founded in terms specific to the culture. Among the images from the conquest of Troy, the fate of Cassan- dra is frequently told.64 Cassandra displays gestures of Hikesia to the image of Athena. Although the image of the Goddess is armed</page><page sequence="11">Protecting Strangers 203 i X t;? ?:: :( '"^ r~"'u, 'b; \ rm~lir ~f Ir~"P (~J?qr?() ~f~i~~S~?

MN Napoli 2422 [Erika Simon: Die griechischen Vasen 1976, fig. 128] and the spear is pointed to the aggressor, the gesture at the sacred center is not effective: 65 Ajax, swelled by victory and bloodthirsty, violates the priestess. We enter the epoch of asylia with the Cassandra myth, in which the altar as place of asylum and the ritual procedure of eliminating pollution of impious deeds gain enormous importance. But even here human agreements are obviously more important than the location's sacredness.66 In the formative phase of the poleis the tem- ple plays a central function, where the citizens suspiciously main- tain equal treatment among themselves. The temple stores a large amount of surpluses which results in greater economic equality. This wealth is proudly displayed in competition with other city- states.67 Many cities are not yet (or will not be) fortified and the treasuries are scarcely protected."68 If a citizen of a foreign polis is allowed to take compensation for a grievance, termed by the Greeks auiAv,69 then the temple is the best place easily to find money. For</page><page sequence="12">204 Christoph Auffarth this reason attempts are made to exclude these treasuries from acts of private justice by pronouncing it aoutov, "not allowed for private justice".'0 This proclamation must be supported by bilateral treaties with other city-states. It is not a quality of the sanctuary as such. That is, there are many sanctuaries, which cannot provide asylum.7' The proclaimed asylum of a temple can be asserted by the stranger for himself by placing himself under the roof and pro- tection of the deity.72 3.3 Sanctions by Gods and Men who Violate Asylum: The Case of the Lydian Paktyas Claiming Asylum for Himself The case is briefly told: A Lydian named Paktyas is given a dangerous assignment by the Persian king, Kyros, to complete a war expedition. Scarcely is Kyros underway to another operation when Paktyas revolts.73 He attempts to win the Lydians over to his side. But in vain. Fleeing from Kyros and his army the Lydian seeks refuge in the Greek city of Kyme.74 Immediately the Persian king demands his extradition. The Kymeans have to choose between protecting a stranger who applied for asylum or to wage a war they are sure to lose against the king of kings. With this dilemma it seems best to put the question to an oracle. They consult an oracle nearby, the Branchidai oracle.75 The answer is clear, sur- prisingly clear: Paktyas should be delivered back to the Persians! This seems a convenient solution. However, one citizen does not believe this and charges that the messengers have lied. A group of citizens including the critic again consult the oracle. The question is precisely formulated that a hiketes seeks refuge with them escap- ing a violent death. Once again the oracle returns the same answer: extradition. The still sceptical citizen challenges the answer.76 He throws out the birds that have built nests in the oracular sanctuary. Then he hears a voice shouting-the oracle abandons his restrained behaviour-forbidding "the most blasphemous of all" not to drive away the hiketai of the oracle.77 The citizen places the contrary question: "You protect those who seek asylum with you, but demand that we release the refuge?" The God replies: "Yes, I do. You should commit this sacrilege and then perish because of it, just so you don't ever return asking if you should extradite a stranger."''</page><page sequence="13">Protecting Strangers 205 Herodotus enjoys conducting historical thought experiments.78'" Which is the case here, too. The Kymaeans do not extradite Pakytas. Instead they send him to a neighbouring island. These inhabitants plan on their turn to send him to the Persians. So the Kymaeans take him back and send him to another neighbouring city. Although he takes immediate refuge in the Athena temple, the protectress of the city,79 they remove him by force and, to receive a large reward, they hand him over to the Persians. This blood- stained money is no advantage. The long chain of defeats for the Ionian cities now begins.80 One may attribute to Herodotus' peculiar religiosity, that he saw in the mysterious events following the evil deeds of the blasphemous God's handiwork. However, as a model of explanation it was widely accepted. This can be shown with the affair of Kylon: Six generations or so after the event the Spartans at the onset of the Peloponnesian war still could demand the handing over of the descendants of the accused in order to eliminate the pollution by punishing them.81 4. Some Conclusions In regard to the current discussions about the founding of asylum as a human right, I conclude with the following remarks. (1) If jurists are to speak about the civilizing power and the evolution of rights creating a more human society then they must ignore the primitive and past societies. In a world and an age of refugees there is no place for optimism that evolution (or in political terms: convergence to democratic systems) will solve the problem. (2) In primitive democracies there had been rights of strangers not only for the guest but also for refugees. They had to apply for protection by using conventional signs. These signs were under- stood and accepted everywhere. By codifying laws, regions were created where rights of strangers were not valid. (3) There are no centers of sacral power in primitive society that punish or are believed to punish transgressors of justice automatically. God's punishment goes hand in hand with the punishment by men. The talk of divine protection enables the human protectors to gain the advantage of wide acceptance which</page><page sequence="14">206 Christoph Auffarth could compensate for a deficit of actual power. The right of asylum is nothing, if it is not carried through energetically by men. (4) The rights of asylum in the primitive democracy of Israel and early Greece exist in context with its fundamental principle.82 This principle states that the strengths of a community are best measured both by wealth self-consciously exposed (e.g. in the tem- ple buildings built by the community as a whole) and by just treat- ment of the weak and defenseless. The stories illustrate the necessity of these rules as thought experiments tracing the grave consequences of a violation of the rules. Asylum was a fundamental challenge to powerful members of its society to help those who had not the means to help themselves. (5) There is no way back to personal, face-to-face societies or the stage preceding codification of laws. And there was no "brave old world" in past times. However, whoever gained economic power was required to support the weak by the system of Leiturgia. For our situation, I think, we could learn the following: asylum is not just a supplementary policy stemming from economic security. We, the rich, like to hide behind the paragraphs of the laws and point to others, who reject those applying for asylum. We cannot exploit the resources of the Third World getting rich by selling them weapons, but close our eyes and borders, when the exploited seek help. We live in One World.

What was there formulated as everybody's right in every place (a sub- jective right), was altered in article 14 of the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" on 10.12.1948. (a declaration, which moreover does not bind the signers in international law, cf. Felix Ermacora: Menschenrechte in der sich wandelnden Welt.

This was achieved by changing "the right to seek and be granted" into "the right to seek and to enjoy". "Das vermeintliche Menschenrecht wird zum Staat- srecht auf Asylgewaihrung".

K6ln [u.a.] 1948, 5-9, the quota- tion p. 6. 4 I apologize for considering especially German conditions and positions in this first part. I can see here the stage in full light (to let aside the dark corners). I could perceive only flashes about English or American conditions. In many contribu- tions Otto Kimminich defends the evaluation of the asylum as a human right, the most complete and latest one: O.K.: Artikel 16. Lieferung 49 of the Drittbearbeitung des Kommentars zum Bonner Grundgesetz, Hamburg 1984. Helmut Quaritsch, on the other hand, wants to show by harsh critique and special cases, that the right of asylum is misunderstood, if it is taken as a human right (Das Recht aufAsyl - ein miAdeutetes Grundrecht. Berlin 1985): When the fathers of the Grundgesetz (GG) took the right of asylum as a human right regarding their own experiences with Nazi-Germany, they put this burden as a kind of reparations on the shoulders of people, who have had no connection with those twelve years of the Third Reich neither geographically nor genetically [sic!] ("eine Art ewiger Reparationslast zugunsten jener, die mit den zwolf Jahren des Dritten Reiches weder r~iumlich noch genetisch etwas zu tun haben" (49 n. 96). Against this contention Selk (esp. 52; 141-161) shows convincingly, that any reduction of the right of asylum would annihilate this right at all. He reads the formulation of the GG as a subject's right of the refugee. 5 On Herrenchiemsee the constituent assembly discussed the right of asylum with regard to the bill of the human rights of the United Nations, see Der Parlamen- tarische Rat 1948-1949. Akten und Protokolle, hrsg. von Kurt G. Wernicke; Hans Booms 2: Der Verfassungkonvent aufdem Herrenchiemsee, bearbeitet von Peter Bucher, Boppard 1981, 220. See also Kreuzberg (see n. 3), p. 43-44, Session of 19.1.1949. Carlo Schmid called the reception of the asylum into the constitution a question of generosity (p. 41, cf. Kreuzberg p. 69) whereas others proposed to grant asylum only to Germans (42; 44 f). In the discussions they were guided by the experiences of &gt;&gt;us, who lived in emigrations&lt; (by the "Praxis, die wir politisch Emigrierte hinter uns haben"). But this restriction to political offenders could already be found in the bill of the UN, they used as prototype: "Prosecutions genuinely aris- ing from non-political crimes-do not constitute persecution". The German for- mulation on the other hand allows to grant asylum not only to those who are persecuted by a penal court. The jurisdiction accepts in reality often also religious, racial, sometimes even social suppression as reason of asylum, s. Michael Selk: Asylrecht und Verfassung. Erforderlichkeit bzw.

When the Catholic Codex iuris Canonici, canon 1179, claimed a right for the Churches to grant asylum, even in time of its promulgation in 1917 this was not tenable against the all-embracing jurisdictional demands of the states. 9 Arnold Gehlen: "Asyle.

They have been used as polemical designations of the former situation in political discussions, e.g. in the French Revolution (but not correct, see Schmale [n. 8]).

Against their explanation of the asylum as originating in a sacral-magic stage, which one can already find in August Bulmerincq: Das Asylrecht in seiner geschichtlichen Entwicklung beurteilt vom Standpunkte des Rechtes, Dorpat 1853 (p. 44 "Geschiitzt waren die Asyle im Allgemeinen durch die Heiligkeit, die ihnen als geweihten Ortern innewohnte"), Albert Hellwig had stated that the refugee took protection with a mighty person (not the protection of a holy place): Das Asylrecht der Naturvolker.

The formation of the term could not be understood without the anti-semitic assertion that the Jews excluded the members of other ethnic groups and that they were allowed to deceive them, assertions that were subject of various proceedings and expert opinions at lawcourts and were condemned as malicious and false, see e.g. Hermann L.

He agrees p. 250 with Carl Schmitt, that there is no charity in politics. Even if one concedes this, one must ask whether you take all ideals of humanity, human dignity and human rights as idle gossiping of liberal politicans, ideals, which are hard to fight for and easily destroyed in a moment, when things get serious (durch den Ernstfall).

Westermann (s. n. 1) withdrew his view, expressed in BK 1, 70-73; 538 f. But it seems to me impossible, to eliminate the dialogue 18, 17-32 without a substitute (so Westermann BK 2, 361).

Thus Enki justifies himself for saving Atrahasis ("Noah") with the sentence III vi 25 f: "Impose your penalty [on the criminal, but not on the mankind as a whole] and whoever disregards your command!" (Translation by Wilfred George Lambert; Alan R. Millard: Atra-hasis, the Babylonian Story of the Flood. Oxford 1969). 23 [Hermann L.

See Fliickiger-Guggenheim (see note 21); also to be seen in Atrahasis III iii 30 f; III v 34-36, cf. Christoph Auffarth: Der Opferstreik. Ein altorientalisches "Motiv" bei Aristophanes und im homerischen Hymnos (forthcoming). 26 Cf. Burkhard Gladigow: "Epiphanie, Statuette, Kultbild. Griechische Got- tesvorstellungen im Wechsel von Kontext und Medium". Visible Religion 7(1990), 98-121. 27 The Dionysiac versions of the myth of the reception of the disguised God deal with the revelation and cultic reception of God. This theme can be recognized in the part of Abraham (Gen 18, 1-20) when-after v. 13-v. 15-the dread of the Lord comes over Sara. But later on, Jahweh does not go with the two "men" (19, 1 "angels") to Sodom (18, 22). Chapter 19 deals then only with the law of hospitality. See already Friedrich Horst: "Recht und Religion im Bereich des Alten Testaments" [1956], in: F.H.: Gottes Recht. (ThB 12) Miinchen 1961, 273: "Eine gegen die Asylverletzung von der dynamistischen Sphire selbst ausgehende Sanktion scheint jedenfalls schon damals nicht ernsthaft beffirchtet worden zu sein". He connects this with the elimination of magic ("Entmagisierung") in the religion of Jahwism, but there is no hint to a magic stage preceeding Jahwism. 28 This can be proven by the formula of blessing/curse as well which results in fertility to the righteous, but unfertility and catastrophes to the evildoers. The formula is found as a social institution at the end of treaties, oaths etc., which also lead to a tradition that was received in Ancient Greece from the Ancient Near East, see Christoph Auffarth: Der drohende Untergang.

(Schriften der K6nigsberger Gelehrten Gesellschaft, geisteswissenschaftliche Klasse 7, 3) Halle 1930, 177 f. 40 The word does not mean "planned" in the sense of deliberately (committed murder) as it is usually understood, see Roland De Vaux: Das Alte Testament und seine Lebensordnungen 1.

But the two verses talk about different casus. The only other reference for Carmah Josua 9, 2 has to be translated with "deception". Therefore, R. Schmid: "miqlfit" (see n. 38), 1133 correctly speaks of "fraud". 41 The significance of (not accepted) secrecy and (accepted) publicity in the "shame-culture" of Iceland is examined by William Ian Miller: "Dreams, Pro- phecy and Sorcery: Blaming the Secret Offender in Medieval Iceland".

Exodus 21, 13 f: Die Vorrechte der heiligen Stitten und ihrer Diener werden auf die Stfidte und deren</page><page sequence="21">Protecting Strangers 213 Rat der Altesten fibertragen". This is not confirmed by the text. In Dtn 19, 1-13 the elders decided whether somebody was worth being granted asylum. Here, Dtn is only more explicit than the book of Covenant, s. Schmid: "miqlfit", 1133 f. There is no confirmation of the thesis that the institution of city-asylum is a reac- tion to the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem, as one could not find accessible altars for asylum. Secularization and sacral power of the altar are suppositions not confirmed by the evidence. 44 Psalm 61, 4: The wings ofJahweh overshadow those, who search for protec- tion. Psalm 91, 1, cf. the shadow of the roof, which Lot calls protection of the stranger (see above n. 20). Max L6hr (see n. 39), 187 sees the roots of what he calls personal asylum in hospitality too, but as framed by utilitarian goals: "Der Gastfreund als Patron des fremden Haindlers verrichtete bei den Geschiiften jenes Maklerdienste", i.e. he earned money by granting hospitality. The same idea is found in Hendrik Bolkestein (see n. 45). The laws of the stranger however, do not deal with the business-man nokri, but with the poor and powerless stranger, cf. n. 30. 4 For the motif and its dissemination in the Ancient Near East and Greece: see n. 21.

(Olympische Forschungen 17) Berlin 1989, 74: "Der Schild der Athena, der auf ilteren Bildern im Profil erscheint, wird hier - in ganzer Gr61e vor dem Betrachter ausgebreitet und gibt damit der Asylie und dem Frevel noch stairker bildhaften Ausdruck -, steigert die drohende Macht des G6tterbildes". This can only be understood as an oxymoron: In spite of the threatening power of the image of the God (which so turns out to be impo- tent) Ajax commits his sacrilegious deed, without being punished for the moment. 66 In his tragedy "Hiketides" ("Maiden applying for asylum") Aischylos on one hand stresses the sacral power of the altar, but on the other he shows that nothing but the community guarantees this right, and, if necessary, defends it by force.

Chiron 19(1989), 127-164. Herrmann also refers to the deprivation of the right of granting asylum which the Roman senate realized (Tacitus, annales 3. 60-63). The Roman citizen- ship functions as an equivalant, cf. Paulus in front of Festus Acts 22, 25-29; 25, 1-12. 71 Hierosylia, "spoiling of holy things", is not prohibited by international law, but generally concerns embezzlement or false use of sanctuary money (against Elsas: Asyl [see n. 14]).

Xenophon, Agesilaos 11, 1 quotes as a proof of the &amp;pesl of Agesilaos that he never mistreated who had fled in the protection of the Gods (~x&amp;t6r 08ejv), even enemies: It would be silly to designate sanctuary thieves as templerobbers (iepooj6Xou) whereas people, who pulled strangers away from an altar (but donated some money to the temple) were considerd as pious (sesaeZS). 73 Hdt 1. 153-161.
