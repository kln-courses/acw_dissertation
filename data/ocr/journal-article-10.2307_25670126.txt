<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERMANN DEUSER Translated by Dennis Beach, O. S. B. The Pennsylvania State University Hume's Pragmaticist Argument for the Reality of God1 Kant and Hume refuted, not the theistic arguments, but their own, admittedly weak, versions of some arguments for a substitute for theism. ?Charles Hartshorne I Although it is still widely held that the history of proofs of God came to an end with Kant and Hume, or, in any event, that the power of their argu ments was undone, this opinion has meanwhile itself become an anachro nism. The new interest in the proofs of God, pursued avidly especially in English-language philosophy of religion for some decades now,2 documents not only a quite surprising interest in this classical topos of the philosophi cal tradition, but above all, the necessity of this thematic issue for theology and philosophy of religion. If God can no longer be spoken of in a well founded way, the basis of (Christian) religiousness and scientific meta physics would collapse, and with this, we would likely lose the ability to formulate questions concerning a creative unity and development of life as well as of the sciences, questions concerning reality and truth. That this is not the case above all with the two great modern witnesses to the critique of the proof of God (namely, Kant and Hume) is shown by an in spection of their relevant texts. As far as Kant is concerned, his late reli gious writing tells a far different story than one in which he could be remem bered as the demolisher of the idea of God.3 And Hume?

We should begin anew with the reading and the discussion of this question! II In the two German editions of Hume's Dialogues,4 the editors vouch each for a different side of the still disputed interpretive dilemma: Hoerster repre sents the thoroughly skeptical position, that is, that the teleological argument shows itself to be untenable, and that Philo is the one "in whose mouth by and large Hume puts his own conception."5 Gawlick, on the other hand, does not want to let Philo's turning and confession of faith in part 12 be forgotten, and he writes, "Theism remains the victor not through better arguments, but through the unconquerable evidence of its fundamental thesis."6 Moreover, no decision on this issue is immediately forthcoming from the text, for the appeal of the dialogue consists precisely in the fact that Hume does not proceed doctrinally and dogmatically, but portrays opin ions and arguments by the passions of persons who, in the end, vote on everything very differently than the discussion appeared to suggest as it was conducted. The three conversational partners represent (1) the posi tion of a markedly orthodox theology of revelation, which presupposes and defends the concept of God directly in its nonrationality: Demea; (2) the position of a rational theology, which supports itself primarily on the argumentatively defended plausibility of the teleological argument: Cleanthes; (3) the scintillating position of the methodical skeptic who rep resents himself as an agnostic relative to the determinations of the proper ties of God, but then in the end, in the direction of theistically patterned thought on the question of a general recognition of God as the First Cause (concerning the explanation of the order and purposiveness of the world),7 does not refuse to accept the teleological argument: Philo. From the start, Demea has a weaker position in this constellation. He misunderstands Philo's argument as if it defended his (Demea's) concep tion of God against the rationalistic proof-claim represented by Cleanthes, and he notices too late?after the objection in principle to the proof of God a priori in part 9 and after the remorseless destruction of theodicy in parts 10 and ll8?that his alliance with Philo was only an illusion and that con sequently his own arguments against the two conversational partners were essentially futile: "Thus Philo continued to the last his spirit of opposition and his censure of established opinions. But I could observe, that Demea</page><page sequence="3">HUME'S PRAGMATICIST ARGUMENT 3 did not at all relish the latter part of the discourse; and he took occasion soon after, on some pretense or other, to leave the company" (76). This removal of Demea at the end of part 11 does not mean that Hume did not previously allow his own arguments to be represented even by this figure. However, for the key question of the complete interpretation?Which of the three positions is harmonious with Hume's own, or the "right one"?? Demea is naturally excluded. From the point of view of the apportionment of speeches and the weight of the arguments, it is at first glance certainly Philo who must stand nearest to the position of the actual author. Nevertheless, this does not agree with the concluding evaluation of the dialogue's framing device, "that Philo's principles are more probable than Demea's; but that those of Cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth" (89). However, sorting out this question remains the proper task of interpretation; it is hardly to be discharged by hints at Hume's own consideration for the church or the philosophically inconsequential opinion of the frame narrator (Pamphilus).9 In this matter what finally counts is the weight of the arguments, and their peculiar char acter will now be traced. But here consideration should be given only to the teleological argument (and not the concisely and conclusively refuted ontological or a priori argument in part 9; also not the theodicy question in parts 10 and 11). The teleological argument itself shall be considered not in the sense that the separate steps of its defense and critique must be taken up anew,10 but in such a way that one observes the characteristics of what Philo actually refutes, and what he doesn't, or alternatively, what Philo actually is able to defend, and what not. What will thus be brought to the fore?and this is the thesis of this new interpretation of Hume's religious thought in the Dia logues?is that Cleanthes introduces (beginning with part 3) a variant of the teleological argument as it was advanced in part 2. The validity of this second conception eludes Philo's actual attack, for it presupposes in oppo sition to this an independent, instinctive power of conviction. This shift is to be designated "pragmaticist" in the sense of Peirce's late philosophy.11 Ill Cleanthes proposes his first formulation of the proof a posteriori?which version of the teleological argument we can also call the machine anal ogy?m Part 2, and from there the discussion of the matter focuses on this point:</page><page sequence="4">4 HERMANN DEUSER Look round the world: Contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infi nite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions, to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are ad justed to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much ex ceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also re semble; and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the gran deur of the work, which he has executed. (15) Philo brings the machine analogy at the beginning of part 5 to the succinct formulation: "Like effects prove like causes." This hits upon the mecha nism of the argument exactly, and also its problematic: that for this ana logical inference, insofar as it concerns God, similarity and nonsimilarity are precisely as immanent as the fact that human beings can draw conclu sions only on the basis of themselves and their experience, that is, only anthropomorphically. While Philo in no way rejects the analogy in its formal structure as an inference to an otherwise unknowable cause,12 he disputes throughout, and with a succession of counter-examples, the presumptuousness of analogy and anthropomorphism in the case of the relationship between God and the world or God and humankind. This process agrees with the skeptic, who always introduces his own counterproposals?for example, the divine world-soul in part 6, or the cosmogonic model of evolution in parts 7 and 8?merely as playful hypotheses, which could be more or less true or false, and which thus serve only to relativize Cleanthes's arguments in proof of the machine analogy. Without working through Philo's individual counterarguments here?already in part 2 there are at least five objections against the efficacy of the analogy in the case of the inference to God (17 21)?it can nevertheless be maintained that Philo succeeds in decisively weakening the strength of the machine analogy as a plausible analogical inference to God (as the necessarily thought origin of the universe) be cause he is able to show that the distance (spatial and temporal) between the origin of the universe and our experiences must be determined as so immense that analogical inferences can produce nothing under such condi tions. God?conceived in any way one likes?is simply too remote.</page><page sequence="5">HUME'S PRAGMATICIST ARGUMENT 5 The corresponding argument is, however, in no way valid for the objec tion of anthropomorphism,13 for when the point of departure is and must be taken from human experience, there is in principle no objection to the an thropomorphic formation of notions and inferences, which rather must nec essarily be the framework of the process. It is Demea for whom the anthro pomorphic conception of God is unbearable, because Demea on the one hand maintains the predicates of God according to the sense of traditional metaphysics, but on the other hand must reject the thinkability of these predicates (26f.; 28f.). For Philo, anthropomorphism is rather a polemi cally additional objection, which in other respects does not harmonize with his evolutionary and cosmogonic conceptual models. The power of Philo's speeches consists?rather than in the superficial intention of thwarting the machine analogy?in something completely dif ferent: With his insistence on the difference between mind and nature (30f.), on the multiplicity of possible causes or principles such as "reason, in stinct, generation, vegetation' (46), with his discovery of the problematic of order and chance (43, 57f.), of the natural connection of chaos and the formation of order (51), Philo strikes upon the modern conception of a self-organization of matter (31, 42f.). However, he does not know how to gather these evolutionary thoughts either scientifically or intellectually into a comprehensive model and restrains himself?as a good skeptic?for such restraint is best on this difficult question: "Our experience, so imperfect in itself, and so limited both in extent and duration, can afford us no probable conjecture concerning the whole of things" (45). One might be allowed to say that this situation has been changed on the basis of modern physical science. For, while the distances to the beginning of the universe have become from both a macro- and microcosmic point of view not at all smaller, but rather infinitely and infinitesimally greater, at the same time knowledge of the interconnection of thought and nature, of probability and actuality, of instinctive hypothesis-formation and truth has grown enormously. In this sense?to speak metacritically of Philo?not only is his rejection of anthropomorphism no longer as destructive of the teleological argument as it appeared to be in the Dialogues, but his counterexamples to the analogy depend on a presupposition that we today must no longer participate in: that nature and thought should be in them selves alien to one another, and that nature itself attests gaps between its beginnings (which are unknown to us) and the present in which we live, by means of which it is excluded or at least extremely unlikely that we could ever come to know the actual origins and true grounds of anything at all.</page><page sequence="6">6 HERMANN DEUSER The unity of nature in the basic elements that are present to us and the structures of contingency as well as order?a unity that has at least been sought for intensely in the twentieth century?no longer forcibly separates mind and nature from one another, and thus does not at all represent Philo's view of things. The question that is posed rhetorically near the end of part 2 (a question that would be answered in the negative by Philo): "Is nature in one situation, a certain rule for nature in another situation, vastly differ ent from the former?" (20) must today perhaps be tentatively answered with a "Yes," in respect of the basic forces that have been discovered and the consistent configuration of order in nature that is sought. The same pertains to Philo's question concerning the observability of originary states: "Have you ever seen nature in any such situation as resembles the first arrangement of the elements? Have worlds been formed under your eye? And have you had leisure to observe the whole progress of the phenom enon, from the first appearance of order to its final consummation? If you have, then cite your experience, and deliver your theory" (22). What in the eighteenth century must perforce have been considered hubris?merely to imagine the observation of cosmic origins?has become today partially accessible and imaginable by means of simulations of past evolutionary states. With this, Philo's skepticism, considered on general scientific grounds and not merely on those of philosophical theology, has had the rug pulled out from under it. IV In part 3 of the Dialogues, Cleanthes reacts to Philo's objections and formu lates the teleological argument a second time?now introduced by a methodi cal consideration of the critique of skepticism, and this is what justifies really speaking of an independent second version of the argument. Furthermore, it is in this light that one must read the picture of nature that is appended here; it manifestly no longer concerns itself with the machine analogy: The declared profession of every reasonable skeptic is only to reject ab struse, remote and refined arguments; to adhere to common sense and the plain instincts of nature; and to assent, wherever any reasons strike him with so full a force, that he cannot, without the greatest violence, prevent it. Now the arguments for natural religion are plainly of this kind; nothing but the most perverse, obstinate metaphysics can reject them.</page><page sequence="7">HUME'S PRAGMATICIST ARGUMENT 7 Consider, anatomize the eye: survey its structure and contrivance; and tell me, from your own feeling, if the idea of a contriver does not imme diately flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation. The most obvious conclusion surely is in favor of design; and it requires time, re flection and study to summon up those frivolous, though abstruse, objec tions, which can support infidelity. (25) Philo nowhere refutes this argument, nor even ever answers it directly.14 Philo persists in exposing the weaknesses of analogy and anthropomor phism (parts 4 and 5), he develops his cosmogonic model (parts 6-8), is an influential contributor to the theodicy discussion (parts 10 and 11) and fi nally, in part 12, concedes that even he does not completely abandon "com mon sense" in matters of religion and the teleology of nature (77). Still, he does not here retract any of his objections against analogy and anthropo morphism; Philo concedes merely "that the cause or causes of order in the universe, probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence'" (88). The last part of the Dialogues thus in no way presents a renunciation by Philo of his position at the level of the first teleological argument, as if, against his better wisdom, he should turn to acceptance of the inferences Cleanthes draws. Part 12 must rather be understood as Philo's reaction, his answer due since the second teleological argument of part 3 to the turn in the character of the discussion made by Cleanthes's new version of the argument concerning the whole situation of the problem. A different im pression arises at first in the course of the discussion, as if Philo were in deed always correct. But this impression, which in any case cannot be squared with the results of part 12, comes solely from the fact that Cleanthes himself does not explicitly thematize the second version of the argument? a version we would like to term pragmaticist. On the contrary, he defends himself subsequently on the level of the proposed problem of analogy and anthropomorphism, a level on which Philo proves himself more eloquent, and recapitulates the pragmaticist argument rather ineptly, as an ungroundable declaration or assertion. Thus, at the end of part 4, when Cleanthes renews his censure of the skeptics, his criticism touches only the "general harmony" (32). The rea son why this could be a metacritical idea is not mentioned by Cleanthes; rather, he asseverates: "I have found a Deity, and here I stop my enquiry" (32). But Cleanthes does lead his other level of argument into the fray more strongly at the end of part 5, when against Philo's exaggerated and destructive distortion of anthropomorphism he finally can only protest: "I see, that, by the utmost indulgence of your [Philo's] imagination, you never</page><page sequence="8">8 HERMANN DEUSER get rid of the hypothesis of design in the universe; but are obliged, at every turn, to have recourse to it. To this concession I adhere steadily; and this I regard as a sufficient foundation for religion" (38). Here, too, Philo makes no direct reply (except in part 12), yet Cleanthes's proposition, uncontra dicted in the discussion that ensues, is noteworthy in several respects: (1) It repeats the objection against skepticism that Philo himself had made his own from the very beginning: absolute ("pyrrhonic") skepticism is practically unfeasible and thus in itself of no consequence (4ff.).15 He employs this objection on the level of the second teleological argument. (2) Moreover, Cleanthes shows here that he clearly sees the differenti ated planes of discussion that heretofore had been present: Philo's criti cism always operates solely on the assumption that in general a construc tive position is advanced that then itself depreciates into weakness. Ac cordingly, Cleanthes must not seek further counter-arguments and examples on the level of the defense of analogy and anthropomorphism; rather, he ought to call by name the premises that remain tacitly in play even for Philo: the "hypothesis" of the ordered universe is plainly not to be avoided. And Cleanthes's second version of the argument claimed nothing else than this?namely, to be convincing in a manner that amounts to sheer instinc tive compulsion. (3) Insofar as Cleanthes insists on this point, he appeals to an existential rather than a logical act, and thus precisely to that of which Philo does not actually speak. For this reason?within the limits of the figures as Hume drew them?the consistent skeptic Philo in principle cannot answer. (4) If Cleanthes calls this constantly co-operative and thus presupposed "hypothesis" a "sufficient foundation for religion," this does not at all mean that here a theological minimum is formulated, which is to involve no the ism, no concept of God, and consequently no Christianity.16 A minimum for assent is at issue only on Philo's plane of discussion, or that of the first teleological argument. While the epistemological foothold of the pragmaticist argument establishes this, it undertakes to advance no further step at all on its own plane toward the presentation and function of the God-hypothesis. It is precisely this that is the practical limit of Hume's Dialogues, in other words, the position of Cleanthes. (5) The claim of proof in the first argument is certainly concerned with this turning of the argument insofar as its rationalistic assertion of the representability of the essence or nature of God is to be curtailed consider ably. Furthermore, in the ensuing discussion, nothing is clearly resolved on this issue, for these decisive questions hang expressly in suspense between Philo and Cleanthes.</page><page sequence="9">HUME'S PRAGMATICIST ARGUMENT 9 Finally, this same confrontation repeats itself at the end of part 7: Philo in the role of one who knows how to forge fantastic and limitless objec tions; Cleanthes rebuking him as one who, in his view?that is, on the second level of discussion?has right on his side despite everything: "And I question not, but you are yourself, at present, in the same case, and have not the solution so ready as the objection; while you must be sensible, that common sense and reason is entirely against you, and that such whimsies as you have delivered may puzzle but never can convince us" (48). V But what then does pragmaticism mean? According to Peirce's late phi losophy of Pragmatism or Pragmaticism,17 the following definitional com ponents can be indicated: (1) Peirce's pragmaticism proposes a universal (semiotic) theory of mean ing related to "possible practical consequences" that are represented by a conceptual meaning.18 (2) Epistemologically, pragmaticism encompasses the independent in ference of abduction (hypothesis, conjecture), that is, the "explanatory hypothesis" in which alone new things are made accessible to the human mind. By contrast, deduction offers only a necessary, and induction a prob able, conclusion in relation to something already present.19 The idea of God, as Cleanthes advances it in his second argument (in part 3 of the Dialogues), corresponds precisely to such an abduction, that is, a convinc ing hypothesis, that ultimately not even Philo can escape. "The form of inference, therefore, is thus: The surprising fact, C, is observed; But, if A were true, C would be a matter of course, Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true."20 (3) For this reason, only abduction is suitable in an argument for God. While it certainly agrees with the analogical conclusion in this sense, it does not do so on the basis of inductive probability derived from experi ments. Despite the form of analogical conclusion it has, abduction has made no claim for itself as a proof, but rather?especially in the domains of art, conduct of life, and religion?as an immense power of conviction (without which even scientific hypothesis would remain barren!): "The abductive suggestion comes to us like a flash. It is an act of insight, although of</page><page sequence="10">10 HERMANN DEUSER extrememly fallible insight. It is true that the different elements of the hy pothesis were in our minds before; but it is the idea of putting together what we had never before dreamed of putting together which flashes the new suggestion before our contemplation."21 (4) The applicability of abduction to Cleanthes's second teleological argument is however secured primarily by this, that the ability to make abductive connections in human thought is not merely presented as a psy chically contingent giftedness, but rather has a generally instinctive char acter. When Hume and Peirce speak of "common sense," they mean the processes of the human mind, which are not the product of human self control and "critical logic,"22 but are clearly already actively present be fore such products. Human instinct is one of right thinking; "right" in the sense of fitting and convincing hypothesis-formation,23?and thus far is instinctive thought necessarily anthropomorphic! In precisely this lies the unassailable strength of the argument for God, as Cleanthes introduces it from part 3 of the Dialogues on, constantly, albeit with some difficulty. It is at this level that Cleanthes approaches "still nearer to the truth" (89) than Philo, except that Hume does not really succeed in distinguishing the two levels from one another, or in thematizing them as such in the Dialogues. Such a distinction would mark the difference between the logic of abduc tion and the logic of analogically inductive reasoning (as it applies to the traditional teleological argument, Cleanthes's machine analogy). (5) On the whole, the all-decisive difference between Peirce's pragma tism (and thus the pragmaticist argument for God) and modern critique, such as Hume portrays in the character of Philo, ought to be delineated as the opposition between realism and nominalism. In the Dialogues Hume discovers no definitive assessment of this issue, for his insistence on the reality of feeling, instinct, and force of conviction (Cleanthes's second ar gument) is just as strong as Philo's nominalistic critique of proofs of God. Only in part 12, with the departure of Demea, the apologist for orthodox uncomprehended religiosity, can Philo leave off the line of his attack. That is, the real basis for the critique of religion was clearly dogmatism and "abhorrence of vulgar superstition" (82). If dogmatism and superstition can be regarded as unacceptable, not characteristics of true religion, then religion of the heart and "the philosophical and rational kind [of religion]" (83) would be one, and this would produce the first real unity between Cleanthes and Philo. This unity in the issue would nevertheless presuppose that nominalism would also be philosophically unmasked as an erroneous form of modern thought. Peirce characterized this difference as follows in a 1909 manuscript:</page><page sequence="11">HUME'S PRAGMATICIST ARGUMENT 11 It is true that it is no easy task[,] for a Nominalist, because he thinks the only Real Being is that of Singulars, and consequently by thinking means imagining, which he, very falsely, supposes brings up to his contempla tion objects determinate in all respects; according to which, a boy could not wish for a horse without wishing that it be of just such and such a shade of color; such and such a weight, to an ounce; age to a day; sex, etc., etc. For a person who admits that there is a Mode of Existence analo gous to that Mode of Knowing, which we call Expectation, that is Exist ence in futuro, and another Mode of Existence analogous to that Mode of Knowing which we call Memory (that is, Existence in the Past;), and who admits further that besides the Mode of Being we call Existence there are two others, of which the one is that of Would-being, or the Be ing of Law, while the other is May-being.24 If "God" is thought of nominalistically as a unique object, then the ap proach is self-contradictory from the start, and every determinacy excluded. In this sense the following must be valid: God does not "exist" (understood nominalistically). In contrast to this, the reality of God is the actual theme of philosophical theology as well as of religion, only here "proofs" in the sense of a proof of existence are disregarded. The nominalistic misunder standing must be removed in order again generally to discover that what is at issue in arguments about God is reality in a universal sense, which com prises possibility, actuality, and necessity (understood in terms of law and rule) as operationality [Prozessualitat] and futurality. Cleanthes was not a stranger to this view, nor was Philo, as he testifies at the end of the discus sion. While certainly neither succeeds in the discussion of the matter in avoiding the false claim of proof, nevertheless they both adopt instinct, feeling, and common sense as basic activities of religiousness in regard to the conduct of life. The greatness of the Christian idea of God lies pre cisely in surmounting this dilemma, and doing so for the benefit of nonsuperstitious religion and non-nominalistic philosophical theology. In any case, Cleanthes does not allow himself be talked out of this in Hume's Dialogues. Justus-Liebig- Universitat, Giefien NOTES 1.

See CP 5.174: "If you ask an investigator why he does not try this or that wild theory, he will say, 'It does not seem reasonable.'It is curious that we seldom use this word when the strict logic of our procedure is clearly seen. We do [not] say that a mathematical error is not reasonable. We call that opinion reasonable whose only support is instinct." 24. From the (fragmentary) last statement of Peirce's 1909 manuscript, MS 641: Signifies and Logic. See the survey of Peirce's unpublished papers by R. S. Robin, Annotated Cata logue of the Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1967). One can recognize clearly in this citation that, in Peirce's sense, Pragmatism in no way (as it often appears with William James) amounts to the critical alternative: It is a question of whether something is first true?and we are consequently convinced of it; or whether we are fully convinced of something?and it consequently must be true.</page></plain_text>
