<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Tyndall, Pantheist A Rereading of the Belfast Address By Ruth Barton* THE CHIEF PRONOUNCEMENT OF THE MATERIALISM of the nine- teenth century" was one hearer's description of John Tyndall's presidential address to the Belfast meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1874.1 In line with this interpretation, Tyndall is widely considered by historians of science and intellectual historians to have been one of the few mate- rialists in Victorian Britain, and the Belfast Address is taken as a focus of "con- frontation between materialism and revealed religion."2 This is a problematic interpretation, because Tyndall was an admirer of Thomas Carlyle, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, leading representatives of idealist phi- losophy. Frank Turner describes Tyndall's admiration for Carlyle as a paradox. "Para- doxically, highest praise of all for the greatest of popular Victorian idealists came from John Tyndall, the one Victorian scientist who had no hesitation in referring to himself as a 'materialist.' "3 Turner shows that it was not only Carlyle's social theory-his advocacy of government by an aristocracy of talent, to which the men of science perceived themselves to belong-that appealed to Tyndall and the other publicists of science, but also his metaphysics. The exponents of scientific naturalism found in Carlyle's natural supernaturalism a religion without theology that provided a secular basis for ethics and permitted the men of science to portray themselves as having specialized knowledge of the laws of nature and the laws of morality. Turner suggests that the scientists did not always recognize the * School of Social Sciences, Curtin University of Technology, Bentley, Perth, Western Australia 6102.

Carlylean heritage of their thought when they combined scientific analyses with assertions of the ultimate mystery of the universe and affirmations of the emo- tional nature of man. I shall argue here that the Belfast Address was a conscious and deliberate attempt by Tyndall to set scientific "materialism" in the larger context of natural supernaturalism. Recent historians of literature, familiar with literary expressions of romanti- cism, have been more perceptive than most historians of science in identifying romantic and idealist tendencies in Tyndall's metaphysics. Anna Therese Coss- lett, arguing that science and humanistic values are reconciled in Tyndall's popu- larizing lectures, points out the importance of imagination in Tyndall's account of scientific thought, his awareness that scientific explanations do not remove mys- tery from the universe, his perception of the universe as living, and the integra- tion of his scientific knowledge and moral experience. Paul Sawyer, after noting Tyndall's dualism of emotion and intellect, his organicism, and his "natural su- pernaturalism," suggests that Tyndall and John Ruskin were in "essential agree- ment. "4 Both show the inadequacy of the "materialist" label, which they use only in quotation marks, but neither attempts to supply an alternative. In extending the analyses of Cosslett and Sawyer I shall argue that the roman- tic and idealist components of Tyndall's thinking were indeed as important as the 4Anna Therese Cosslett. -Science and Value: The Writings of John Tyndall," Prose Studies, 1978, 2:41-57: Paul Sawyer, Ruskin and Tyndall: The Poetry of Matter and the Poetry of Spirit.- in Victorian Science and Victorian Values, ed.

To label Tyndall a "materialist" and the Belfast Address as "materialism" is to mislead and oversimplify. When Tyndall referred to his own views as "materialist" it was with careful qualification. His 1868 presidential address to the Mathematical and Physical Section of the British Association lim- ited itself, significantly, to "scientific materialism." And in the Belfast Address Tyndall became explicit: he quoted approvingly Carlyle's conviction that "an Intelligence is at the heart of things." He asserted that materialism cannot be "a complete philosophy of life," warned his listeners that "the 'materialism' here professed may be vastly different from what you suppose," and commended pantheistic conceptions of the universe.5 That these assertions by Tyndall were not evasive, rhetorical tactics but expressions of his deepest convictions will be argued in this article. The first section of the article discusses the British Association and establishes the context for its meeting in Belfast. Second, a detailed reading of the Belfast Address illustrates how the main argument of the address leads beyond material- ism to pantheism. Third, the themes of romantic and idealist thinking that Tyn- dall drew on are briefly outlined. The fourth and fifth sections trace the develop- ment of the themes of the Belfast Address in Tyndall's unpublished papers and previous speeches, showing that the idealist and pantheist themes were of both early and continuing importance to him. THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION The most controversial session of the British Association in the nineteenth cen- tury was Tyndall's presidential address at Belfast in 1874. The problem was not simply that Tyndall espoused his anti-Christian metaphysics-he had done that at previous British Association meetings-but that as president and, therefore, rep- resentative of science he had attacked revealed religion and, many people thought, advocated materialism. This was "an abuse of his office," according to one critic. Tyndall had a right to express his opinions, said another of the many sermons composed in response to the address, "but not in the name of science: not as the mouth-piece of the British Association. "6 In the mid-Victorian period the position of president of the British Association carried both status and power. The annual meeting was often perceived as the president's meeting. This was expressed by the annual meeting banner, which bore the name of the president, the name of the meeting place, and the coat of arms of either the president or the place. The president was held responsible for the success of the meeting; not only did he (it always was "he" in the nineteenth century) give a presidential address, but he had an indirect voice in the rest of the program. The president, in consultation with the two semipermanent general sec- retaries of the association, nominated the sectional officers-presidents, vice- presidents, and secretaries-and the speakers for the popular evening lectures. Sectional officers planned the timetables and controlled the discussions in the 5 John Tyndall, "The Belfast Address," in Fragments of Science: A Series of Detached Essays, Addresses and Reviews, 2 vols.

Personal invitations from the president often followed the official invitation of the Association, and acceptance was perceived as an act of support for the presi- dent. Thus the scientific tone of the meeting-serious research, polite diversion, or heated sectarian debate-was determined in large part by the type of support the president was able to attract. After the 1867 meeting, when the Duke of Buccleugh was president, William Spottiswoode wrote to J. D. Hooker, the pres- ident-elect: "[We] all mean, if all goes well, to muster in force around you next year. ... Our Duke and his supporters have left us rather hungry in matters scientific."7 "We" was the X Club. Since 1864 Spottiswoode and Hooker had been meeting each month for dinner with Tyndall, T. H. Huxley, John Lubbock, Edward Frankland, Thomas Hirst, George Busk, and Herbert Spencer, all representa- tives of the movement described by Frank Turner as "scientific naturalism."8 The scientific naturalists were committed to developing naturalistic conceptions of man, nature, and society that were consonant with the findings of contempo- rary science. From the progress of science, they believed, would flow social, economic, and intellectual progress, for the application of science produced tech- nology and the naturalistic and critical thinking engendered by science would become habitual in all areas. As a group the X Club was committed to advancing scientific knowledge through research and the efficient organization of the scien- tific community and to promoting scientific "habits of thought" through educa- tion and popularization. They were opposed to any external control of science, whether by political or theological authorities. The activities of the British Asso- ciation provided many opportunities for the club members to advance their con- ception of science. They gave popular public lectures at the annual meetings, promoted the serious discussion of research in the sections, and made science policy on the Association's committees. Over club dinners they discussed the policies that should be pursued by the Association and the people who should fill its positions. The club minutes record that the members drew up a list of section presidents for the next Association meeting in February 1868 and that they de- cided to add Lubbock's name to the Committee on Scientific Education in Jan- uary 1869.9 In 1874 the British Association was to meet in Belfast, and it was therefore appropriate that Tyndall, an Irishman, should be nominated for the presidency. Tyndall, who had declined the position on three previous occasions, was this time persuaded to accept. Huxley, who was one of the persuaders, assured Tyn- dall of his support: "I am at your disposition for whatever you want me to do, as you know, and I am sure that Hooker is of the same mind." 10 Tyndall wrote to 7 William Spottiswoode to J.

Meanwhile, Tyndall's close friends at home were worrying that his outspokenness would arouse unnec- essary controversy. Hooker wrote to Huxley: "Spottiswoode and I have had a grand talk about Tyndall; and are in a Quandary. My impression gathers strength, that the Belfast meeting will be, under any circumstances, as bad as Bradford ... and that if Tyndall is Pres., it may be worse still.... Spottiswoode and I are agreed that it is impossible either officially or unofficially to advise Tyndall.""1 Tyndall had recently been embroiled in bitter public debates over the efficacy of prayer and the theory of glaciers. His opponents were trying to stir up the latter controversy in Belfast. Controversy was also looming over the teaching of science in the Catholic University in Ireland. Even Huxley feared Tyndall's bel- ligerent and controversial propensities in such an atmosphere. He offered him discreet advice. "I wonder . . . if you are going to be as wise and prudent as I was at Liverpool [Huxley was president of the 1870 Liverpool meeting]. When I think of the temptation I resisted on that occasion . . . 'I marvel at my own forbearance!' Let my example be a burning and a shining light to you. I declare I have horrid misgivings of your kicking over the traces."912 Huxley's reputation for controversy makes his claim to forbearance surprising. There are two points to consider here. The first point is context. The president of the British Association spoke for science and had to represent the views of the scientific community. A restraint that might not be required in other contexts was therefore necessary. The second point is one of style. Huxley was a master of evasion and was always willing to claim ignorance or uncertainty to avoid making inappropriate statements.13 Tyndall, on the other hand, believed that honesty required utter straightforwardness. His first aim in the address, he wrote to Huxley, was "to be true to myself." So he prepared to expound the metaphys- ical implications of modern scientific thought, as he saw them, to the people of Belfast. Huxley was "supporting" Tyndall by giving one of the two public lec- tures. He described his plans to Michael Foster: "I have chosen 'Animal Auto- mation' and its history-about the most completely scabreux topic I could have Leod, and P.

You shall see how I will dance between the eggs [i.e., avoid giving offense]. "14 Accounts of the Belfast meeting vary. Sir Charles Lyell congratulated Tyndall on the success both of his address and of the meeting, which he said was "owing I have no doubt in a great degree to your having spoken out so freely and fear- lessly." Tyndall wrote to a close friend: "If I except the theologians all passed off in the most harmonious manner.... But you can form no notion of the religious agitation. Every pulpit in Belfast thundered of me."'15 One hearer described the atmosphere in the lecture theater as "more and more sulphurous," but newspa- pers reported that the 1?/4-hour address was frequently interrupted by applause. Given the controversy, Huxley considered moderating his own lecture on animal automation, but on Foster's advice he decided to make no changes. He was surprised to meet with a "warm reception."116 Tyndall's reception was warm in a different sense. For a whole year Britain was deluged with rebuttals; Protestants, Catholics, and Unitarians preached against the address. Tyndall's thousands of readers and hearers by no means agreed as to what he had argued for. Many attacked and some praised him for "materialism" and "materialistic atheism." Some even demanded that he be tried for blasphemy. Others suggested that Tyndall was not an atheist but was seeking a "more com- plete understanding of the character of God."117 Sympathetic and philosophically sophisticated commentators offered more discriminating analyses. One reviewer, although finding the address "a powerful exposition of the arguments for modern Materialism," considered that Tyndall was "something more" than a materialist because he found "Mystery" in every particle of matter and suggested that Tyn- dall, like Giordano Bruno whom he had discussed, might be a pantheist.18 What then did Tyndall say? THE ADDRESS The core of the Belfast Address was an argument for the adequacy of materialism as a philosophy of science. Tyndall argued that the phenomena of vegetable, animal, and human life are all part of a chain of cause and effect governed by the law of conservation of energy and reducible to mechanical laws, the wonderful variety and complexity of the living world being explained by Darwin's theory of natural selection. But, because emotion is as much a part of the human mind as 14 Tyndall to Huxley 130, 1 July 1874, Huxley Papers, Vol. 1, fol. 128; and Huxley to Michael Foster 84, 12 Aug. 1874, Huxley Papers, Vol. 4, fol. 90. 15 Sir Charles Lyell to Tyndall, 21 Oct. 1874, Tyndall Papers 15/F5.16; and Tyndall to Thomas Hirst, 26 Aug. 1874, Tyndall Papers 12/B3.6. 16 Lodge, Advancing Science (cit. n. 1), p. 35; "British Association for the Advancement of Science," The Times (London), 20 Aug. 1874, pp. 4-5, on p.

A recurring theme of the address was that human feelings-included here were wonder, religious awe, artistic creativity, and sexual passion-demand as much satisfaction as human intellect. The address is a carefully constructed argument in which the first seven sec- tions build up to the denouement in Section 8, where Tyndall claimed for matter "the promise and potency of every form and quality of life." Differences exist between versions. The address that Tyndall delivered was a shortened version of the paper from which he read. The text of the spoken address was printed the following day in both the Times and Nature. When it was published in the Asso- ciation's Report, the omitted paragraphs were reinstated and minor wording changes made, the phrase just quoted becoming, for example, "the promise and potency of all terrestrial Life. "19 A few further minor changes in wording were made when the address was republished in Fragments of Science. Because the alterations and additions clarify without modifying the argument, the final ver- sion is the one quoted from here.20 There are three general themes in Tyndall's argument-an analysis of the na- ture of matter, a demand for scientific freedom, and an almost-contradictory admission that there are mysteries beyond science. Ostensibly, the first half of the address is a history of atomic theory. It is, however, a selective, dramatic history in which the personae all serve as steps in Tyndall's argument. Discus- sions of atomic theory are used to raise philosophical questions about scientific reasoning, the mind-body problem, and theism. Many evaluative comments are made in passing. The gods of Greece and Christendom are described as capri- cious and haughty; protagonists are commended for reasonableness and ethical feelings; free thinking is associated with courage; and seeking "personal happi- ness hereafter" is equated with profit seeking. The framework of Tyndall's argu- ment is a history of the progress of the human mind in which science and free thought battle forward and finally triumph over tyranny.21 However, even as he claims, in the ninth and last section, that all cosmological theory is the domain of science, Tyndall admits that there are aspects of human nature that science can- not satisfy. Section 1 introduces the atomic theories of the ancients and in doing so alludes to a number of theses and concepts that are developed as the argument proceeds. In good evolutionary fashion Tyndall begins with primeval man. Science, like the speculations of primeval man, arises from the human desire to find causes for natural phenomena. In passing, Tyndall describes scientific method as "a process '9 "British Association for the Advancement of Science" (cit. n. 16), quoting p.

H. Creasey, Life and Work of John Tyndall (London: Macmillan, 1945), pp. 179-194. Tyndall's references show that he drew these notions of progress from David Hume, Wil- liam Whewell, and John W. Draper.</page><page sequence="8">118 RUTH BARTON of abstraction from experience" by which are formed "physical theories which lie beyond the pale of experience" (p. 135). This conception of scientific method is developed later into his theory of scientific imagination, but here it is an aside as Tyndall quickly moves from the "anthropomorphic," inadequate notions of primeval man to the "purer," physical principles of the Greeks. Tyndall then describes the atomic theories of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, drawing heavily on Friedrich Lange's History of Materialism.22 But, he says, these theo- ries do not satisfy the ethical requirements of human nature. "Man never has been, and he never will be, satisfied with the operations and products of the Understanding alone; hence physical science cannot cover all the demands of his nature" (p. 141). This is a key assertion. Section 2, a discussion of science from the Greeks to the Middle Ages, intro- duces Tyndall's central concept of the imagination. Developing a suggestion of William Whewell, the foremost idealist philosopher of science in early Victorian Britain, Tyndall criticized Aristotle, claiming that although he had "an almost superhuman power of amassing and systematising facts," his theories were vague and confused because he had a "natural incapacity" to form mental pictures (p. 149). According to Tyndall, the mind's capacity to form clear, coherent pictures of physical conceptions is the basis of theory formation in science. Such a picture is called Vorstellung in German, and the act of picturing, vorstellen. The closest English translation is "imagination" (p. 150). Next Tyndall discussed the so-called stationary period in science. By using Giordano Bruno rather than Copernicus to mark the end of the stationary period, he gave himself the opportunity of familiarizing his audience with pantheism-al- though not in so many words-and of implying that pantheism is superior to theism. Bruno, one of the first converts to Copernican astronomy, came close to "our present line of thought" in pondering the problem of life. Bruno's conclu- sion-and once again Tyndall was following Lange-was that Nature, in her productions, does not imitate the technic of man. Her process is one of unravelling and unfolding. The infinity of forms under which matter appears was not imposed upon it by an external artificer; by its own intrinsic force and virtue it brings these forms forth. Matter is not the mere naked, empty capacity which philosophers have pictured her to be, but the universal mother, who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own womb (p. 154).23 There is an emotive weight to these words. The infinity of forms are not imposed on matter by an external artificer, but brought about by matter's own intrinsic force and virtue. Tyndall contrasts the external and the imposed with the intrin- sic. Nature does not imitate man and human (or divine) artifice: what grows is superior to what is made. Thus Tyndall, through Bruno's anthropomorphism of the "universal mother," presents matter as having the capacity for life. 22 Friedrich A. Lange, The History of Materialism and Criticism of Its Present Importance, trans. E. C. Thomas, 3 vols. (2nd ed., London: Trubner, 1879-1881), was first published in 1865. Tyndall had Vol. I (1873) but not Vol. 11 (1875); see F. A. Lange to Tyndall, 19 Jan. 1874, Tyndall Papers 29/E10.A1. On Lange see Maurice Mandelbaum, History, Man, and Reason (cit. n. 2), p. 16; and Frederick Gregory, Scientific Materialism in Nineteenth-Century Germany (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1977), pp. 31-33, 147-151. 23 Cf. Lange, History of Materialism, Vol. I, pp. 232-235. There is a minor difference in the Nature version: "was not imposed" reads "were not imposed"; "Inaugural Address" (cit. n. 19), p. 311.</page><page sequence="9">JOHN TYNDALL, PANTHEIST 119 The discussion of atomism since the seventeenth century in Section 4 begins to make explicit what was implicit in Section 3. Tyndall now uses the words Cre- ator and pantheism. Theism and pantheism are presented as congenial to differ- ent types of mind. Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle are examples of those with minds whose "analytic tendency" seeks theories that satisfy "the understand- ing." They explain the motion of matter by "a detached Creator, working more or less after the manner of men." This, Tyndall implies, is a demeaning view of the Creator. In contrast, Goethe, Carlyle, and other "men of warm feelings" with "minds open to the elevating impressions produced by nature as a whole, whose satisfaction, therefore, is rather ethical than logical," usually adopt "some form of pantheism" (p. 159). They exhibit the synthetic tendencies of the human mind.24 Tyndall's language indicates that he approved of the reasoning of those who felt the wholeness of nature and who sought ethical satisfaction. The refer- ence to understanding develops the allusion in Section 1. The understanding is here associated with logic and precision and is contrasted with warm feelings and ethical concerns. The section ends with a brief discussion of James Clerk Max- well's presidential address of the previous year. Tyndall uses Maxwell's exposi- tion of atomism to support his own case but invokes Kant against Maxwell's argument for a Creator. Tyndall is about to raise the crucial question of consciousness. His history of atomic theory has arrived at the present with the conclusion that the atomic doctrine has a firm hold upon "the foremost scientific minds" (p. 161), a conclu- sion that made no reference to the contemporary debate over atomism.25 He has noted discussions of sensation and consciousness in Democritus, Descartes, and Pierre Gassendi, but now he focuses directly on the issue. At this key point in the argument he uses his theory of scientific imagination: a theory is a picture con- structed by the mind; conversely, if there is no clear mental picture, then there is no theory. Tyndall next stages a debate between Bishop Joseph Butler and a disciple of Lucretius-both of whom, being honest and reasonable men, represent Tyndall's own views. The Lucretian challenges the bishop to form a clear mental concep- tion of the "living powers," "percipient powers," or "true self" of his idealist philosophy. In all our experience, the Lucretian argues, the self is associated with the body and is affected by that body. (These are the standard materialist arguments for the dependence of mind on matter.) Therefore the bishop can have no conception of the "self' except in association with the body. The bishop replies that the Lucretian has similar difficulties, for he cannot "imagine" how the movement of "dead," sensationless atoms of oxygen, phosphorus, and so forth can produce sensation, thought, and emotion. The Lucretian cannot "sat- isfy the human understanding in its demand for logical continuity" between mo- lecular processes and the phenomena of consciousness. This, says Tyndall, speaking through his bishop, "is a rock on which Materialism must inevitably split whenever it pretends to be a complete philosophy of life" (p. 168). 24 This section was shortened in the spoken address. The synthetic and analytic tendencies of mind were contrasted, but Goethe, Carlyle, Boyle, and Newton were given as examples only in a footnote; "Inaugural Address," p. 312. 25 On the atomic debates see David M. Knight, Atoms and Elements: A Study of Theories of Matter in England in the Nineteenth Century (London: Hutchinson, 1967), Ch. 6.</page><page sequence="10">120 RUTH BARTON The inadequacies of materialism are put aside for the next two sections while Tyndall shows how recent science had sustained materialism. Section 6 intro- duces Charles Darwin. Darwin, who was supremely familiar with all the exqui- site adaptations of nature, which were generally adduced as evidence of a de- signer, nevertheless rejected the notion of a manlike "supernatural Artificer" and explained these wonders by natural causes (pp. 176-177). Section 7 introduces other significant aspects of contemporary science and philosophy. The law of conservation of energy destroyed vitalism by binding vital and physical phenom- ena into a single causal network. The physiological study of the nervous system shows more clearly again the connections between the physical and the mental (pp. 180-181); vital and mental phenomena do not belong to separate orders of existence. Finally, Tyndall refers to the work of Herbert Spencer to explain naturalistically how the senses and intelligence have developed (pp. 182-187). Section 8 draws all this together. We seek ultimate explanations for the exis- tence of intelligent life and structured matter. Bishop Butler having crushed ma- terialism, we are left with two alternative kinds of ultimate explanation: creative acts (previously advocated in Tyndall's drama by Boyle and Newton) or a changed conception of matter (previously advocated by Bruno, Goethe, and Car- lyle). Tyndall now has his protagonists change sides as he exploits inconsisten- cies in their arguments for his own polemical purposes. Lucretius departed from his own materialist principles and followed "instinct," Tyndall tells his audience, for he attributed volition to atoms in order to explain structure and pattern in the universe (p. 189). Darwin, who gave natural explanations for adaptation and ap- parent design, fell back on an anthropomorphic explanation for the origin of life, suggesting that the Deity may have created the original form or forms of life (p. 189). Tyndall rejects this orthodoxy (for one creative act is as problematic as many creative acts) and, having dissociated Lucretius from the Lucretians, he returns to the Lucretian-Butler debate. He recounts the conclusions of the de- bate: in all our experience of life, life is linked to matter; although unable to imagine (i.e., theorize about) the nature of the link, we can trace it from the highest to the lowest organism. But, argues Tyndall, as he extends the argument, we cannot stop at this point. Observation, even with microscopes, has to stop, but the scientific mind is not restricted to what can be observed. Theory always goes beyond observation. The parts of a broken magnet are always found to be polarized, and it is concluded that the molecules are also polarized. Might not living matter be analogous? Tyndall asserts his conclusion: Believing, as I do, in the continuity of nature, I cannot stop abruptly where our microscopes cease to be of use. Here the vision of the mind authoritatively supple- ments the vision of the eye. By a necessity engendered and justified by science I cross the boundary of the experimental evidence, and discern in that Matter which we, in our ignorance of its latent powers, and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, the promise and potency of all terrestrial Life (p. 191).26 26 There are many changes in this quotation. At Belfast, according to Nature, Tyndall said: "I prolong the vision backward across the boundary of the experimental evidence, and discern in that matter, which we in our ignorance, and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, the promise and potency of every form and quality of life"; "Inaugural Address" (cit. n. 19), pp. 317-318.</page><page sequence="11">JOHN TYNDALL, PANTHEIST 121 No experimental proof exists for this thesis, admits Tyndall, as he points out the errors of the theory of spontaneous generation. The intellect extends the range of the senses. Is this materialism? It is not as you suppose, says Tyndall to his audience. He then introduces the epistemological arguments of John Stuart Mill, Kant, and Fichte and concludes, in a manner reminiscent of Huxley, that we cannot know the real nature of the external world, although there is no doubt as to its exis- tence: "Our states of consciousness are mere symbols of an outside entity which produces them and determines the order of their succession, but the real nature of which we can never know" (p. 193). All-the nature of matter, the evolution of life, of species, and of mind-is inscrutable mystery. Tyndall's audience may have preferred to believe in the action of a mysterious Creator, so once again Tyndall formulated the alternatives: either there is "an Artificer .. . acting by broken efforts as man is seen to act" (and "broken" efforts are surely unworthy of a Creator), or all phenomena "have their unsearchable roots in a cosmical life" (p. 194). The argument presumes that sensation and intellect are, similarly, part of the cosmos. Finally, in Section 9 Tyndall gives a brief account of what he has meant by his allusions to the human understanding and by his claim that science satisfies only the understanding. Understanding is only one of the forms of human conscious- ness produced by the interaction between organism and environment. "The ama- tory passion," awe, wonder, and reverence have all likewise evolved and are equally valid forms of human experience. Human capacity, human knowledge, and human experience have two independent aspects. On the one side Tyndall refers to objective knowledge, intelligence, understanding, knowing faculties, and thought; on the other are poetry and emotion, feeling, heart, creative facul- ties, faith, and moral and emotional nature. The two sides of human nature are independent; therefore feeling must not dominate intellect, and, consequently, theology must not dominate science. In provocative language Tyndall asserted that science would "wrest from theology, the entire domain of cosmological theory" (p. 197).27 However, intellect needs feeling, for example, to "whip" it into action. Science, because it satisfies only the understanding, cannot be a complete philosophy of life. In spite of this dualism Tyndall sought unity. "The human mind . .. will still turn to the Mystery from which it has emerged, seeking so to fashion it as to give unity to thought and faith" (p. 201).28 Tyndall found this unity not in materialism but in a cosmical life that is manifested in both matter and mind, thought and emotion. Nevertheless, in the context of the Belfast Address, Tyndall's conclusion about the limitations of materialism as a philosophy of life occupied a small place. In the polarized popular debate of the 1870s, so soon after the publication of Darwin's Descent of Man in 1871, it is not surprising that Protestant and Catholic defenders of orthodox Christianity saw the Belfast Address as an at- tack. Tyndall had advocated the standard materialist arguments and he had at- tacked orthodox theism, even daring to include such heroes of natural theology 27 At Belfast Tyndall was slightly less provocative and asserted only that all religious systems that reach into the domain of cosmogony must "submit to the control of science, and relinquish all thought of controlling it" (ibid., p. 318). 28 At Belfast the word still was not used (ibid., p. 319).</page><page sequence="12">122 RUTH BARTON as Newton and Boyle in his criticisms. But even as he attacked the accommoda- tion between science and religion worked out in natural theology, Tyndall advo- cated a new accommodation rooted in the natural supernaturalism of Carlyle and German romantic idealism. Historians of "the conflict between science and reli- gion," anesthetized by their metaphors, have mistakenly seen the address solely as an attack.29 Although the new accommodation between religion and science is a theme throughout Tyndall's published works, his private papers show how central this accommodation was to his thinking. Accordingly, the last section of this article sketches the development of Tyndall's philosophy of life as seen in his early journals and letters and in his later published works, showing that his desire to satisfy "the heart" as well as "the understanding" was not merely an unsuccess- ful rhetorical device but the expression of a well-articulated philosophy of life. A brief overview of romantic idealism will set the stage. ROMANTIC IDEALISM Tyndall's materialism was located within a broader idealist metaphysic. At many points in his address, Tyndall implied and even asserted that the view he put forward was not "materialism." He acknowledged his debt to both "the spirit and the letter" of Lange's History of Materialism, adding in the later versions that Lange was not a materialist (p. 137). That is, Tyndall found not only information but insight in the analysis of one of the leaders of the neo-Kantian movement in Germany. In Sections 3 and 4 Tyndall presented theism and pantheism as alter- natives, aligning himself with Goethe and Carlyle on the side of pantheism (p. 158). In Section 5 the conclusion of the debate between the Lucretian and the bishop is that materialism cannot be "a complete philosophy of life" (p. 168). At the apogee of the argument in Section 8 he warned that "the 'materialism' here professed may be vastly different from what you suppose" (p. 192).30 He claimed his conclusion was the same as Bruno's and, to jog the memory and remove all chance of confusion, added a footnote in the printed version reminding the reader that "Bruno was a 'Pantheist,' not an 'Atheist' or a 'Materialist' " (p. 192). Thus, the label that Tyndall was claiming for himself was "pantheist." More significant than labels, Tyndall's arguments and concepts show patterns belonging to that rich, complex tapestry of romanticism and idealism described by J. H. Randall as "romantic idealism. '"31 29 On the misleading nature of the warfare metaphors see James R. Moore, The Post-Darwinian Controversies: A Study of the Protestant Struggle to Come to Terms with Darwin in Great Britain and America, 1870-1900 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1979), Ch. 3. 30 Tyndall was careful to ensure that the word materialism was in quotation marks even in the Nature report; "Inaugural Address" (cit. n. 19), p. 318. The word vastly was not in the spoken address, being added, presumably, when Tyndall discovered how vast the misunderstandings were. 31 In the following discussion I have relied heavily on John Herman Randall, Jr., The Career of Philosophy, Vol. II: From the German Enlightenment to the Age of Darwin (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1965), esp. Ch. 4, "The Romantic Appeal to Experience," and Ch. 10, "Romantic Idealism." In some contexts romanticism and idealism must be distinguished, but even authors who discuss differences also identify a common tradition; see, e.g., Charles A. Culotta, "German Bio- physics, Objective Knowledge, and Romanticism," Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences, 1974, 4:3-38, esp. pp. 6, 26. The problem of romanticism is more tractable if national traditions are consid- ered, but as Tyndall drew on both Carlyle and the German tradition the discussion here cannot restrict itself to any one country. Useful specialist studies are Ronald Taylor, The Romantic Tradition</page><page sequence="13">JOHN TYNDALL, PANTHEIST 123 Romanticism in Germany can be traced back to mid-eighteenth-century devel- opments in aesthetics and theology that stressed aesthetic and religious experi- ence rather than formal rules and rational proofs. This produced a conception of experience vastly broader than the sense-data treated in English and French em- piricist philosophy. First, "experience" included aesthetic, religious, and moral experience; a sense of the divine presence, a recognition of beauty, and the demands of conscience were all part of human experience. Second, experience was not of elements but of wholes. Experience was patterned or structured experience, formed from the bare elements either by intellectual intuition or by the creative activity of the human mind. Creativity and individual experience were valued. Art was concerned with passion and struggle and the unique, rather than with balance and order and representativeness. Religion was a matter of inner experience rather than theological systems, God a mystery rather than the conclusion of a proof (or disproof). Added to these broadened conceptions of experience and of the capacity of the human mind was a new psychology, stem- ming from Rousseau, that added "Feeling" to "Understanding" and "Will" as capacities of the mind. This led to a fundamental dualism of objective knowledge, knowledge of the external world achieved by the intellect, and subjective knowl- edge, knowledge of the inner life that is apprehended through feeling. In German philosophy this dualism developed in the contrast of reason and understanding as ways of knowing, and it entered English-language philosophy via Coleridge and Emerson. Alongside this dualism and the recognition of the variety of human experience there was a unifying drive in romantic and idealist philosophies. Johann Herder celebrated the uniqueness of each cultural tradition while stressing the organic wholeness of each particular culture. With the reaction to the excesses of the French Revolution, the unity of language, literature, religion, and legal and politi- cal traditions became an important theme in political theory. The diversity of cultures showed that universal political solutions were impossible, and the or- ganic unity of each culture led to the conclusion that political change could come about only gradually, on the analogy of organic growth. Randall interprets the great idealist philosophical systems as attempts to construct an ideal of knowl- edge that included both the new science and the breadth of romantic experience. Romantic idealist philosophers sought to overcome the dualism of God and na- ture, man and the universe, mind and matter. A new conception of nature was central. As art turned from order to passion, appreciation of nature shifted from formal gardens to mountain scenery. Reaction against mechanistic science led to nature's being perceived as living and growing, as organism rather than as ma- chine. Nature was appreciated in its fecundity, its grandeur, and its immensity. Thus the qualities traditionally attributed to God were found in nature. At the same time the stress on religious feeling made the God of theological systems unreal. The result was immanence theologies and pantheism. The divine is im- manent in the world, and, as Carlyle put it, the world is the garment of God. Humanity is part of this great unity-human life is part of the great life of the whole, the individual personality an expression of the great suprapersonal force. in Germany (London: Methuen, 1970); and Rosemary Ashton, The German Idea: Four English Writers and the Reception of German Thought, 1800-1860 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1980).</page><page sequence="14">124 RUTH BARTON True religion then became the sense of dependence on, participation in, or union with the great universal life.32 Theological systems were but attempts, more or less adequate, to express this feeling. Idealist philosophies did not claim to be literally true. Kant had shown that the intellect could not grasp the ultimate nature of reality. The idealists offered symbolic interpretations to be evaluated according to their adequacy as guides to life.33 These aspects of idealism are all found in Tyndall's writings. Though not all are conspicuous in the Belfast Address, many can be identified. The psychologi- cal and epistemological dualism of feeling and intellect runs throughout the ad- dress. Tyndall acknowledges the importance of the aspects of human experience that do not belong to "the Understanding." Aesthetic, religious, and moral expe- rience must all be acknowledged by a complete philosophy of life. The human mind seeks to "give unity to thought and faith" (p. 201). Tyndall's emphasis on the role of imagination in the development of scientific theory is a rejection of positivist empiricism and a reflection of the romantic idealist emphasis on the creative power of the mind. There are hints in the address of natural supernatu- ralism and pantheism. Matter is potent with life, consciousness is latent in mat- ter; even more significantly, Tyndall uses holistic organic analogies and meta- phors of force and life. Nature is the "universal mother, who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own womb" (p. 154). There is a "Power whose garment is seen in the visible universe" (p. 194). In this interpretation of idealism, epistemology has a relatively minor place. Modern philosophy, with its epistemological emphasis, has been interested in idealism as an attempt to solve the technical problems of Kantian philosophy. The Kantian argument for the limits of knowledge occupied a relatively small place in the Belfast Address. As the following analysis of the development of Tyndall's philosophy shows, he was more interested in the ethical and religious aspects of idealism than in the epistemological problems. In this he illustrates Randall's claim that "had Kant never lived, romantic idealism would doubtless still have been the intellectual expression of that extraordinary generation of German cultural life" and shows that the same concerns were significant outside Germany.34 THE DEVELOPMENT OF TYNDALL'S PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE Although materialism was an adequate philosophy for the practice of science, Tyndall argued in the Belfast Address, it could never be "a complete philosophy of life" (p. 168). A philosophy of life must include man the subject as well as man the object (p. 195); it must "give unity to thought and faith" (p. 201); it must reconcile the claims of "the Heart and the Understanding" (p. 199). In viewing all 32 The interpretation of religion as feeling, although dominant, was not the only interpretation within romantic idealism.

See also Mandelbaum, History, Man, and Reason (cit. n. 2), pp. 29-36. 33 Randall, The Career of Philosophy, Vol. II, pp. 202-205. Frederick Copleston queries this inter- pretation in his review of Randall (Journal of Philosophy, 1966, 63:724-734, on p. 727) but allows that it may be appropriate for some of the idealist philosophers, particularly Fichte. 34 Randall, The Career of Philosophy, Vol. II, p. 208.

The development of that philosophy over the previous thirty years is traced in this section. Tyndall's personal philosophy is recorded in unusual detail in his journal and in his long, soul-revealing letters to his protege and friend Thomas Hirst. In November 1843 Tyndall, then a twenty-three-year-old unemployed Irish sur- veyor, began a journal that he maintained, although with diminishing detail, for almost thirty years. It recorded his reading, his work from 1844 to 1847 as a railway surveyor in the north of England during the railway boom, his discus- sions on politics and religion, his growing interest in science, his scientific studies in Germany from 1848 to 1851, and his struggles to establish himself in the Lon- don scientific community in the 1850s.35 In 1845 Hirst was among the young men whom Tyndall encouraged to a life of duty and high seriousness. Gradually Hirst came to share Tyndall's aspirations and in 1850 followed him to Germany. Their letters, which began when Tyndall left Halifax for the south of England in 1847, recorded the details of their daily lives, their scientific work, and their discus- sions about the meaning of life. A key figure in channeling Tyndall's energies into science, in confirming his moralism, and in molding his interpretation of religion was Thomas Carlyle. The first reference to Carlyle is in June 1844, when Tyndall read Past and Present and copied extracts from it into his journal. By 1847 Tyndall was a disciple of the sage. In May, on reading Carlyle's Chartism, Tyndall commented, "His position is sometimes startling-to many he will appear impious.... I however thank the gods for having flung him as a beacon to guide me amid life's entanglements." In July, after reading On Heroes and Hero-Worship, Tyndall recorded: "the writer must be a true hero. My feelings towards him are those of worship [or] 'transcen- dent wonder' as he defines it."36 In Carlyle, Tyndall found an individualism and a contempt for democracy and the power of association that turned his energies more consistently to self-culture. He found a morality of work and duty that justified his scientific studies. And he found an interpretation of religion that satisfied his ardent desire to worship a higher power while freeing his intellect from all theological forms. It is significant that Carlyle was not the only person preaching such views, and Tyndall was not the only person who listened. Although middle-class intellec- tuals were slow to take note, in their technical philosophy and theology, of the new German developments, the diaries of Hirst and Tyndall show that Germanic concepts and orientations were quite widely diffused among what R. S. Neale calls the middling order.37 The romantic emphasis on emotion appeared fre- quently in Tyndall's reading notes on political and religious questions. According 35 For biographical accounts of Tyndall see Eve and Creasey, Life and Work of Tyndall (cit. n. 21), Ch. 3; and Joe D. Burchfield, "John Tyndall-A Biographical Sketch," in John Tyndall, ed.

All references to the journals are to the typescript copy bound in 3 volumes at the Royal Institution (Tyndall Papers 4/E10). 37 In "Class and Class Consciousness in Early Nineteenth-Century England: Three Classes or Five?" Victorian Stud., 1968, 12:4-32, R. S. Neale distinguishes five classes: upper, middle, mid- dling, working class A, and working class B. The middling class included "petit bourgeois, aspiring professional men, other literates and artisans" (p. 23). Tyndall considered himself "lower class," and his letters and journals of the early 1850s show great self-consciousness about his status.</page><page sequence="16">126 RUTH BARTON to James Simpson, writing on education, advances in natural knowledge resulted in improved religious feeling, hence "a sentiment of piety independent of doc- trinal theology, must imbue every well-constituted mind." The Italian nationalist Giuseppi Mazzini, in the People's Journal, advocated the rights of the people to property and the vote and praised the wisdom of the people: "The people feel by the heart better than all the small falsified intelligences of our day" that educa- tion is essential for progress. An article in Jerrold's Magazine used Carlylean language: "Ideas which are the life-giving forces of society incarnate themselves in forms or institutions." When the ideas change the forms too must change.38 Romantic attitudes and romantic concepts were widely diffused. The introspec- tion and sentimentalism of Tyndall's and Hirst's letters and journals are clear expressions of romanticism. The romantic redefinition of religion as emotion was taken up by Tyndall be- fore he read Carlyle, and to the end of his life he believed that religious forms hid deep truths. After talking to an "honest simple-minded" Christian in 1844, Tyn- dall hoped he had "derived benefit from his unsophisticated recital of his feelings and experience." He valued the Bible as a record of universal human experience: "[The] same spirit liveth yesterday, today and for ever. The songs of David and the experience of Job are our songs and our experience." But Christian theology was only a special case of "the general formula," merely one possible outward expression of inner, nonsensuous experience.39 Forty years later, at the age of sixty-eight, Tyndall expressed the same ambivalent attitude toward Christianity. Christianity was a mixture of high feelings and "beggarly" doctrines; therefore he did not approve of Huxley's outright attacks on Christian doctrine. He explained to Hirst: "In these matters I am in favour of the decency of slow decay. Besides there is one thing that I feel probably more than either you or Huxley; and that is the goodness, tenderness and even loftiness of heart, that have got mixed up with these beggarly elements of Christian doctrine."40 During 1848 Tyndall's interest in idealist philosophy increased. In January Tyndall heard Emerson lecture and subsequently bought his works. In August he bought Fichte's Characteristics of the Age. In October, having arrived at the University of Marburg in Germany to study physical science, he was reading the romantic philosopher Friedrich Schlegel and studying Kant with Theodor Waitz, the professor of philosophy.41 Emerson and Fichte, with Carlyle, gave Tyndall an understanding of the uni- verse in which the pursuit of science had meaning and value. In retrospect Tyn- dall stressed the moral purpose behind his study in Germany.42 Carlyle, Emer- 38 Tyndall, journals, Vol. I, p. 229, 8 July 1847 (emphasis added); Vol. I, p. 212, 17 June 1847 (emphasis added); and Vol. I, p. 240, 31 July 1847. 39 Ibid., Vol. I, p. 27, 7 Apr. 1844; Vol. II, p. 383, 25 Sept. 1848; and Tyndall to Hirst, [11 Nov. 1848] and 23 Nov. 1848, Tyndall Papers 31/B4.11 (H13) and 31/B4.12 (H15).

Acting on his highest aspirations led Tyndall to Germany; study was his moral duty: "I thought it a duty to cultivate as far as my means allowed such powers as I possessed." He rose at five o'clock each morning and studied German before breakfast, as- sisted by such encouraging advice as Fichte's "sluggishness is the source of all vice." His first task in winter was to break the ice in his tub. He also had a religious purpose for his study in Germany, as he told his pupils at Queenwood in a farewell speech. It was not merely to understand physical laws that he went, for "what are sun, stars, science, chemistry, geology, mathematics, but pages of a book whose author is God! I want to know the meaning of this book, to pene- trate the spirit of this author and if I fail then are my scientific attainments apple rinds without a core."43 Reading Kant, Schlegel, Fichte, Emerson, Carlyle, and many others was part of Tyndall's continuing search for the meaning of the whole. Initially Tyndall did not approve of Kant, who, he claimed, like John Locke and quite unlike Fichte, "must have logical proof for everything." On religion he preferred the approach of Schlegel: "God does not allow his existence to be proved.... [It] must be adopted with the vividness of a feeling."44 Tyndall found satisfaction in a unify- ing pantheistic vision. As he adopted an explicit pantheism he began to use or- ganic analogies for the universe. Tyndall considered both Emerson and Carlyle to be pantheists "in the highest sense," as he explained to Hirst: I dropped an hour ago upon a very significant passage in the Sartor. "Is there no God then, but at best an absentee God sitting idle ever since the first Sabbath at the outside of his Universe and seeing it go?" At the "outside" of his universe. I imagine Carlyle's entire creed is folded in this sentence.... With Carlyle the universe is the blood and bones of Jehovah-he climbs in the sap of trees and falls in cataracts. In contrast, Paley's God was no better than atheism, Tyndall declared. The fol- lowing monthly letter to Hirst continued this theme: The leading idea of Emerson's mind and indeed of almost all philosophic minds ... [is] the unity of the universe.... I think the universe is best illustrated by a human body. All are but parts of one stupendous whole Whose body nature is and God the soul. The universe is a body with a life within it, and through it, permeating its every fibre. Man is one form of that life, vegetables are another.... Everything in nature is in the act of becoming another thing.... The universe is life, rendered so to speak con- crete.... Man is an offshoot from this eternal stock, his spirit is the spirit of the universe.45 These are remarkable assertions from a physicist who was a mechanist. He pre- ferred the organic analogy of the universe as tree to the mechanical analogy of the universe as clock.46 43 Tyndall, Notebook I, "Scientific Alpine," fols. 25-26, Tyndall Papers 2/El; Tyndall to Hirst, 21 Oct. 1849, Tyndall Papers, 31/B5.23 (H42); and journals, Vol. II, p. 383, 25 Sept. 1848. 4" Tyndall, journals, Vol. II, p. 402, 26 Nov. 1848; Vol. II, p. 389, 6 Oct. 1848. 45 Tyndall to Hirst, 13 July 1850 [postmark], Tyndall Papers 31/B7.32 (H93); and Tyndall to Hirst, [19 Aug. 1850], Tyndall Papers, 31/B7.35 (H104, 106, 107). 46 Tyndall to Hirst, 26 [21] Oct. 1849, [19 Aug. 1850], Tyndall Papers 31/B5.23 (H40), 31/B7.35</page><page sequence="18">128 RUTH BARTON In 1850 Tyndall was far from materialism. Not only was he explicitly pantheis- tic, as has been shown, but he also explicitly rejected the dependence of mind on matter. In the late 1840s, while reading Emerson for the first time, Tyndall con- stantly stressed the power of mind over matter. He told his pupils that "every great machine was primarily an idea" and that "thought is the mainspring of all well-directed action."47 In 1851 Tyndall explained to Hirst that the "transcenden- talist" view of the universe, which saw beyond the phenomena, was superior on ethical grounds to the "mechanic" view.48 Harriet Martineau, who perceived only matter and law in the universe, was an "incomplete" thinker. She did not ask where matter and law came from. Tyndall's "premonition" was that "matter and law are so to speak the substratum on which a Deity inscribes himself." Although Martineau's "contemplation of machinery" was diverting to the intel- lect, detection of a "life principle" as "the moving power of the whole" would arouse wonder and joy, while the further recognition that individual life was allied with this universal life would have "a direct and sustaining effect upon the heart and morals." This characteristically idealist justification of a metaphysical position also appeared in Tyndall's mature lectures. "Scientific Materialism," the 1868 address to Section A of the British Association that was an early version of the Belfast Address, concluded that the mystery of how thought could emerge from matter "is not without its uses," for it "may be made a power in the human soul . . . both in steadying and strengthening the intellect, and in rescuing man from that littleness to which, in the struggle for existence, or for precedence in the world, he is continually prone."49 Thus the conclusions that matter is suffused with life and that this view of the universe gives direction and significance to human existence had been reached by Tyndall from religious and ethical arguments by 1851, before he began to discuss materialism in his journals and letters. The arguments for materialism, which are so conspicuous in his later speeches and writings, developed within this broader pantheist metaphysic. That pantheism persisted. Quotations from romantic poets, passing allusions to the view of some "great man" (often Carlyle), and closing assertions that beyond all this knowledge is a great "Mystery" are all evidence of Tyndall's underlying metaphysics. The metaphysics often appears when scientific concepts, such as force, power, or life, are given holistic meanings open to pantheistic interpreta- tion. This is frequently done by capitalization, suggesting holistic, almost anthro- pomorphic concepts. In the Belfast Address the conclusion that matter is not dead, but living, is transmuted without explanation into "All we see around us, and all we feel within us . .. have their unsearchable roots in a cosmical life, [followed by the escape clause] if I dare apply the term" (p. 194). The conclusion that the connection between consciousness and matter is a mystery becomes a conviction that the human mind will "turn to the Mystery from which it has emerged" (p. 201). "Power" likewise acquires an organic, holistic connotation: (H107); and Tyndall, "Science and Man" (1877), in Fragments of Science (cit. n. 5), Vol. II, pp. 335-360, on p. 337. 47 Tyndall, journals, Vol. I, p. 313, 17 Apr. 1848. 48 From Tyndall's report of a lengthy discussion with Hirst while they were on holiday together; journals, Vol. II, pp. 533-534, 9 Apr. 1851.

It was in the mid 1850s, when the materialist debate was raging in Germany, that Tyndall began to formulate the "materialist" arguments for which he became so notorious. His early response was negative. In 1853 he recorded his disagree- ment with Emil Du Bois-Reymond's materialism: ""Du Bois laughs at belief, at faith. The 'Conservation of Force' is his sole creed."50 In lengthy reflections while on his summer vacation in 1855, Tyndall considered the nature of matter and the nature of life. There was, he concluded, no essential distinction between the living and the nonliving. Trees and crystals alike were the product of me- chanical forces, and trees and crystals alike were mysterious. All force, wrote Tyndall, preempting Spencer, is "mysterious in its action." Of thought, however, he could say nothing. The objective phenomena of life, which can be explained mechanically, must not be confounded with the subjective phenomena of thought and consciousness. "The brain is assuredly an assemblage of molecules, ar- ranged according to physical laws. But if you ask me how out of this assemblage the phenomena of thought and consciousness spring, my answer is silence.... The physical problem marks the limit of the understanding and beyond this we must substitute for it the power of Faith. "51 During the twenty years before the Belfast Address, Tyndall elaborated these arguments, both for materialism and for the limits of materialism, through a series of essays and speeches: "Physics and Metaphysics" (1860), Mountaineer- ing in 1861 (1862), "Vitality" (1864), "Matter and Force" (1867), "Scientific Ma- terialism" (1868), and "The Scientific Use of the Imagination" (1870). Signifi- cantly, in his first (1855) exposition of the explanatory power of mechanistic physics, Tyndall did not assert the dependence of mind on matter. Although "the phenomena of thought and physics are united," he did not discuss the interaction of mind and matter and allowed that he did not know if "the soul can enjoy a detached existence and still retain its self-consciousness."52 During the 1850s Tyndall's views on the relation of mind or soul to body moved very slowly from idealism to an inconsistently formulated materialism. The problem was that Tyndall's ethics, which presumed free will and abounded in terms like "moral force," could hardly be made consistent with the determin- ism and conservation of energy of even a limited materialism. In 1852 Tyndall speculated that the soul was "something like a pure force" that was controlled and directed by understanding. The soul was a moral force driving the individual to action, while the understanding directed the action into appropriate channels. By 1860 he altered the roles to give the soul the guiding role: "The soul . .. can stir the body to action, but its function is to excite and apply force, and not to create it."53 This formulation avoided the most obvious problems in making human action consistent with the theory of the conservation of energy but was not consistent with a deterministic natural order. In the early 1860s Tyndall developed the scientific arguments for determinism. 50 Tyndall, journals, Vol. II, pp. 612, 613; 24 July, 21 Aug. 1853.

Dent, 1911), p. 70.</page><page sequence="20">130 RUTH BARTON In a deliberately anonymous 1860 article he asserted that every thought and feel- ing has its mechanical correlate in the brain.54 In an 1862 polemic against praying for miracles he argued that any intervention from outside the system of natural cause and effect was a disturbance of natural law "as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse." In 1864 he affirmed, as a conclusion of modern science, that "there is no creative energy whatever in the vegetable or animal organism." Even an individual's beliefs were part of this deterministic order. Michael Faraday's reli- gion, for example, was "constitutional and hereditary," being "implied in the eddies of his blood and in the tremors of his brain. "55 But Tyndall could not maintain this mechanistic materialism consistently. At Belfast he returned to his idealist description of a "moral force" that "whips" the intellect into action (p. 198). Tyndall himself was infused with this force in the mountains and through com- munion with other souls. The human spirit, being one with the spirit of the uni- verse, would be refreshed and strengthened by direct experience of nature. After watching sunset and moonrise at sea Tyndall wrote, "Whoever listens with rev- erential ear will not he also detect the spirit voice speaking in melody to his soul." Just as Faraday's Sunday exercises refreshed his soul for the week's work, so Tyndall believed "the same source of power is substantially open to me" through nature. He found this power at its strongest in the mountains. As he told Hirst: "The common eye cannot see the use of crags and barrenness of the mountain head: but the rulers of mankind . . . have drawn in their private mo- ments courage and consolation from such sources." Tyndall, an enthusiastic and daring mountaineer, returned to the Swiss Alps almost every year, from his stu- dent days in Germany until 1890, to ally himself "with that fountain of strength and freshness to which the just and noble may always retire and find solace and inspiration. "56 Tyndall's mountaineering can thus be described as the practice of pantheism. (The practice of materialism would hardly explain his going on long climbing expeditions with only a sandwich and a little wine for sustenance and being surprised that the will was not always strong enough to keep the muscles in action.57) This same spiritual power could also be transmitted from one individual to another. Tyndall found refreshment in the company of children and was "in- structed in fortitude and courage" by gazing on an engraving of the Duke of Wellington. A teacher or lecturer should allow "his spirit to stream through" to his audience; he must "awaken life" in others.58 The early 1860s were a key time in the development of the materialist aspects 54 [John Tyndall], "Physics and Metaphysics," Saturday Review, 4 Aug. 1860, 10:140-141, on p. 141.

The first assertions of the dependence of mind on body and of the closedness of the system of natural cause and effect appeared in 1860 and 1861. At the same time Tyndall began to use the concept of theory-creating scientific imagination" that would become the public basis of his claim that matter is living. This was a significant period in Tyndall's professional life as well. His struggles for economic security and professional acceptance were over. With two positions-Professor of Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution (since 1853) and Professor of Physics at the School of Mines (since 1859)-and investments in joint stock companies and Punjab shares, Tyndall could afford to turn down the lucrative Edinburgh Chair of Natural Philosophy at the end of 1859.59 His first book, on mountaineering and glaciers, was published in 1860. He had overcome his poor Irish origins to win acceptance in high London social circles. Now, he had time and energy to consider broader issues concerning the place of scientists in intellectual and political life. Events of the early 1860s raised such issues conspicuously. The public reaction to Darwin's Origin of Spe- cies (1859) and to the theological revisions of Essays and Reviews (1860) indi- cated that theological authorities were a threat to free thought and scientific investigation. Similarly, the response to calls for national prayer and repentance after a bad harvest in 1860 showed that theological authorities were accepted by the nation as better informed about the physical world than natural scientists.60 59 Eve and Creasey, Life and Work of Tyndall, pp. 81-82; Tyndall, journals, Vol. III, p. 797, 7 Nov. 1855; Vol. III, p. 841, 5 May 1856: Vol. III, p. 1057, 12 Mar. 1858: Vol. III, pp. 1161-1163, Nov. 1859; Vol. III, pp. 1026-1027, 5 July 1852; Vol. III, p. 844, 17 May 1856; and Vol. IH, p. 937, 21 May 1857. 60 Turner, -Rainfall, Plagues, and the Prince of Wales" (cit. n. 12), pp. 46-50.</page><page sequence="22">132 RUTH BARTON In this context, Tyndall's personal philosophy, which had served to give meaning to his own existence, developed into an argument for the completeness of science as a description of the natural world. The function of Tyndall's philosophy was no longer personal but social. As Frank Turner has shown, the Victorian conflict between science and religion was partly a conflict between theological and scientific spokesmen over intellectual authority.61 If, as Tyndall argued from 1860 on, science provided a complete description of the natural world, then scientists-not theologians-were the ap- propriate authorities to consult on such matters as health and agriculture. Not that scientists could satisfy all the aspirations of humanity: science gave no ulti- mate explanations, neither of the nature of force, nor of the nature of conscious- ness, nor of the meaning of human existence. Beyond science there was mystery. Artists, poets, and musicians gave expression to the wonder and awe felt in the face of "the Incomprehensible" of which scientists, and theologians, could say nothing. In the early 1860s Tyndall was also involved in philosophical debates within the scientific community. His concept of "scientific imagination" was developed in the context of discussions over the nature of theoretical entities-in particular, the existence of atoms. Although Tyndall still spoke disparagingly of imagination as belonging to the realm of the unintelligible, he found, in 1860, that imagination had a heuristic use in expounding scientific theories. He urged his hearers to "imagine" or "look with the mind's eye" at oscillating atoms.62 A few years later he presented imagination as an essential element in scientific reasoning. Imagina- tion enables the scientist "to transcend the boundaries of sense, and connect the phenomena of our visible world with those of an invisible one," namely, atoms, molecules, and vibrations.63 In 1867 he argued from the seen-that broken mag- nets are also magnets-to the unseen-that the fundamental particles of matter have a magnetic polar structure.64 It was not until Belfast in 1874 that he followed analogous reasoning to conclude that all matter is living. The Belfast Address was the culmination of a series of essays and addresses that argued for a qualified materialism. Tyndall described the limits of material- ism in many and varied ways. In 1864, using his 1851 distinction between the mechanic's perception of a dead universe and the transcendentalist's perception of a living universe, Tyndall assured his hearers that the matter of which he spoke was not the matter described by theologians and philosophers; rather, matter is "essentially mystical and transcendental." In 1870 his formulation was monistic rather than materialistic: spirit and matter are essentially "opposite faces of the self-same mystery. "65 Repeatedly he claimed that existence is a mys- 61 Frank Turner, "The Victorian Conflict between Science and Religion: A Professional Dimen- sion," Isis, 1978, 69:356-376. 62 John Tyndall, "Physical Basis of Solar Chemistry" (1861), in Fragments of Science (cit. n. 5), Vol. I, pp. 329-342, on pp. 332, 337.

The link between consciousness and physical process in the brain is incom- prehensible. The physical processes themselves are not explained, for if you ask the materialist "who or what divided it [matter] into molecules, who or what impressed upon them this necessity of running into organic forms-he has no answer." Even the theory of evolution leaves the ultimate mystery of the uni- verse untouched.66 Theologians might have replied that they had answers to these traditional ques- tions, but Tyndall rejected their insights. "Ultimate fixity of conception" is unat- tainable, for our apprehension of the mystery of the universe is based on feeling, not knowledge.67 The theist who pretends to understand God, said Tyndall with self-righteous humility, is as irreverent as the atheist. Rather, we should stand with awe before "a Power which gives fulness and tone to . . . existence" but which we can "neither analyse nor comprehend. "68 In trying to resolve the problems arising from the dualism of knowing and feeling, Tyndall gave even greater weight to scientific knowledge and thus moved closer to materialism. The central problem is the relationship between objective and subjective, knowledge and feeling, brain and consciousness. What weight can be given to subjective moral aspirations when we know the objective natural order is deterministic? What does it mean to speak of the soul, of Mystery, and of the Incomprehensible? In 1877 Tyndall removed the ambiguities about the power of "soul" and "moral force" in human life. A consistent science denies "to subjective phenomena all influence on physical processes." Nevertheless, the concept of soul has its uses, here on the boundary of intellect, as a "poetic rendering of a phenomenon which refuses the yoke of ordinary physical laws."69 The transition from physics to poetic metaphysics Tyndall described as an "ex- ercise in ideality." To explain what he meant would be to do the impossible-or, in Tyndall's terms, to turn poetic feeling into knowledge. Whether one rejects his philosophy as inconsistent and confused or accepts the radical dualism of knowl- edge and feeling, it is clear that feelings of mystery and wonder before the uni- verse were of immense importance to Tyndall. In his view, none of the argu- ments for materialism undermined the reality and significance of these feelings, on which human creativity and moral aspirations were founded. The Belfast Address closed by asserting the "unquenchable claims" of man's "moral and emotional nature" (p. 200). Tyndall clearly explained the importance of this awareness of mystery when, in the Swiss Alps at age sixty-nine, he remin- isced about Thomas Carlyle. "Worship he defined as 'transcendent wonder'; and the lifting of the heart by worship was a safeguard against moral putrefaction. Science, he feared, tended to destroy this sentiment."70 One of the purposes of Tyndall's lifetime of popularizing science had been to show that Carlyle's fear was unfounded. Science, by its limitations, maintained mystery. 66 Tyndall, "Scientific Materialism" (cit. n. 5), p. 88; see also Tyndall, "Scientific Use of the Imagination," p. 133. 67 Tyndall, "Belfast Address" (cit. n. 5), p. 201; see also Tyndall, "Scientific Materialism," p. 89; and Tyndall, "The Rev.

Every close study shows how few stereotypical materialists ex- isted.71 Yet the nineteenth-century opponents of materialism are not the only ones responsible for our misconceptions. Historians, Charles Culotta has argued, have looked at change in science in terms of conflict and discontinuity and have not looked for cultural continuities. This study has found significant continuities between Tyndall's "materialism" and romanticism, similar to the continuities between biophysics and romantic biology found by Culotta. Historians of "the conflict between science and religion" -noting, correctly, Tyndall's opposition to traditional Christian theology-have put Tyndall and his materialist arguments on the side of science and have failed to see the shared concerns-to reconcile science and religion, albeit in a new way, and to maintain a moral imperative.72 As nineteenth-century philosophers pointed out, metaphysical materialism could not survive the criticism of Kant.73 Tyndall, like Huxley, Hermann von Helmholtz, and Lange, advocated materialism as a methodology, a program, or a maxim of scientific research, but not as a general philosophy.74 Within science, Tyndall claimed, materialism provided a complete explanation; but outside science there was a vast realm of experience on which materialism was silent. Not only the Kantian epistemological arguments kept Tyndall from materialism. Tyndall wanted to see the universe as living and mysterious because he believed that awe and wonder were the basis of human moral and creative life. In the Belfast Address Tyndall described his philosophy of living matter as "panthe- ism." One reviewer characterized it, appropriately, as "lower pantheism."75 As Tyndall more consistently separated poetic and scientific language, the "higher pantheism," which he had so admired in Carlyle and Emerson, became atten- uated; but it was still pantheism rather than materialism. Tyndall slid from "higher" to "lower" pantheism in the early 1860s, at a time of public debate over the order of nature and over the authority of the clergy. In this debate Carlyle's natural supernaturalism, which had been effective in dis- solving theology, was an insufficient basis for asserting the competence and authority of men of science in investigations of the natural world.76 Tyndall combined a materialist interpretation of science with Carlylean natural supernat- uralism to produce his particular pantheistic version of scientific naturalism, thereby sustaining, he believed, both the natural order and the moral order. 71 Both Culotta, "German Biophysics" (cit. n. 31), pp. 17-20, and Gregory, Scientific Materialism in Nineteenth-Century Germany (cit. n. 22), insist on the need to distinguish a reductionist program in biology from metaphysical materialism.
