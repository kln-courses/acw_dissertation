<plain_text><page sequence="1">Extrême-Orient, Extrême-Occident 18 - 1996 Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » 1 Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtmann This paper is concerned with the part played by the intrusion of spatial thinking into Chinese political thought. My interest is focused on the spatial schematic representations of ancient Chinese geo-political units (principalities/ kingdoms) 2 found across diverse classical Chinese texts. Some of these constructs refer to abstract principalities or kingdoms 3, others deal with a set of specific principalities or kingdoms 4, yet both are distinguished by rigid orientation to cardinal directions and remarkably regular configuration. Unfortunately, these constructs become uncomfortably elusive when we try to define them, as it is difficult and, perhaps, impossible to conform their « political » content and « spatial » structure to Western frames of reference which tend to more sharply differenciate the domains of political thought and conceptualizing space. The elusiveness of these constructs seems to have served as one of the reasons why they are almost totally ignored in secondary sinological literature concerned with both political history and spatial concepts. I argue that the schematic representations of principalities or kingdoms are sophisticated conceptual constructs designed to convey political ideas in terms of conceptualizing space , and that the failure to grasp the meaning of these constructs results from a failure to recognize their representational code. Needless to say, overlooking an important and distinctive feature of ancient Chinese political thought may lead to considerable confusion in the interpretation of certain political concepts, or even to a failure to detect some of them at all. For this reason, the schematic representations of principalities/kingdoms merit a full-scale systematic examination 5. However, a discussion as brief as this cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of the issue. This short paper is limited to examining two arrangements of kingdoms found in the Liao di chapter of the Wu-zi, a treatise on the art of war of the 4th-</page><page sequence="2">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman 3rd centuries B.C. A comparative analysis of these arrangements helps to explicate the representational code of the constructs in question. 1. Before discussing the chosen examples in detail, however, several comments on the fundamental principles of conceptualizing terrestrial space adopted by the ancient Chinese are necessary. Primarily, the Chinese tradition of representing the earth's surface seems to be aimed more at conveying a speculative6 terrestrial organization than mapping geographical reality. Evidence for this assertion may be seen clearly even in those terrestrial representations which are expected to portray the actual topography of terrains, that is, in geographical maps 7. The majority of Chinese global maps, as well as the great bulk of local maps made before the influence of European science, are known for their striking lack of precision from the point of view of modern cartography 8. Distortion of Chinese maps is considered to result from their intention to transmit more a certain spatial idea or viewpoint9 than geographical facts. Realised consistently and in a « pure » form, this intention is manifested in schematic terrestrial representations or cosmograms. It is necessary to point out here that a geographical map and a terrestrial scheme, or a cosmogram, are not differentiated clearly in classical Chinese. Both are designated by the character tu, and, therefore, both formally relate to a class of « graphical representations » 10 . Two basic patterns for constructing cosmograms may be distinguished : Io a square grid (see figure la) ; 2° a nest of concentric squares (see figure lb) 11 . There is also an intermediate pattern, that in the shape of a Greek cross 12 , the result of amalgamation of the two basic patterns (see figure lc). These patterns are characterized by the following structural principles : - a cardinally-oriented reference frame of two core axes : vertical/ lengthwise (South-North) and horizontal/crosswise (East- West) ; - symmetry and equilibration of constitutive elements with respect to one or both core axes ; - completeness of structure ; - primary prominence given to the center ; - demarcation of the center and peripheral layers ; 10</page><page sequence="3">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » - tailoring of terrestrial units according to the idea of symbolical quadrature of the Earth's surface 13. Although these principles are rather simple, yet, when applied in a rigid way, they constitute a system of strong constraints which restrict the variables of patterns for constructing cosmograms to the three mentioned above 14 . These patterns form the conceptual framework for Chinese cosmography 15 . Each pattern operates as a sort of coordinate system, differentiating the represented surface, specifically, the terrestrial surface, into units in such a way that their relative locations may be definitively determined. However, the patterns differ dramatically from the coordinate system used, for example, in modern cartography. The main effect of applying these patterns is that the represented terrestrial surface becomes not only considerably distorted (e.g. a piece of land of irregular form will be represented as a square), but is also fundamentally transformed according to a certain idea of space 16. Primarily, each pattern attributes to the delineated units unequal « values » or « ratings ». In general, the « rating » is the highest in the center and gradually decreases towards the periphery. The simplest variation of this hierarchical sequence of « values » is provided by a nest of concentric squares 17 . However, the distinction of the two core dimensions in the patterns may produce much more complicated hierarchical classifications of space than the succession « from the center to periphery ». A particularly striking example of such a classification is provided by the cosmogram Ming tang 18 , as described in the opening section of the Ming tang wei (« The Positions in the Hall of Distinction ») chapter of the Li ji 19 . The « positions » (wei) referred to in this text are supposed to be those taken by the governors of principalities (zhu hou) and the chiefs of barbarians during the audience given to them by the Son of Heaven 20 . All the delineated « positions » are cardinally-oriented with respect to that of the Son of Heaven. The governors of principalities are identified and placed according to their ranks 21 , so that the holders of the same rank share one « position ». Since the relative « values » of ranks in the social hierarchy are definitively determined, the « values » of the spatially organized « positions » may be also determined in a definitive way. In general, the « value » of these « positions » gradually descends from the center towards the periphery. Thus, the holders of the three highest ranks {gongy hoUy bo) are placed by the Son of Heaven. They surround him to the front, east and west respectively. The holders of the two lowest ranks (zi and 11</page><page sequence="4">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman nan) are placed at the main entrance into the Hall (the southern doors). The barbarians are given the peripheral « positions », those outside the Hall, in such a way that one group of barbarians is arrayed outside each of its cardinally- oriented doors. However, the placement of the governors of principalities shows that the « best » « position » among them is that in front of the Son of Heaven, and that being to the east of him or of the main entrance is « better » that to the west. The accounted « positions » are characterized by an extremely important nuance directly related to the issue of this discussion, yet somehow missed in translations of this famous text. Beginning from the governors of principalities of the third rank (bo) and down to the barbarians, the text specifies the « positions » of kingdoms (guo) which belong to holders of a certain rank, rather than to the persons who actually hold this rank ! This curious characteristic, which posed a considerable problem to the translators, shows that the specified « positions » express a hierarchy of terrestrial space classified according to social hierarchy. The Ming tang wei chapter highlights the key term in the conceptualizing of space by the ancient Chinese - « position » (wei). This term points to the principal function of the spatial patterns, namely that they determine the places of the represented geographical objects with respect to the idea of a hierarchical organization of space. The non-linearity of these patterns involves the delineated « positions » in a multi-dimensional, yet well-balanced set of relationships. Thus, each pattern inevitably produces a construct of remarkably regular configuration. By means of these, the idea of properly ordered and harmonious terrestrial organization is expressed. In summary, the conceptualizing of space by the ancient Chinese provides an excellent illustration of its relativistic perspective, that is, of its view as an expression of a set of relationships between objects 22 . From this point of view, space changes with the alterations in the « positions » of objects and of the « observer » (the cross-point of the co-ordinate axes corresponding to the « center » of the world) 23 . 2. There is a consensus among scholars that the « The Five Zones (Layers) », as found already in the Yu gong , and « The Nine Provinces, » as presented in the Di xing xun , the fourth chapter of the Huai nan zi (not later than 139 B. C.), and the Ming tang are of a purely schematic nature. The schematic character of these constructs is easy to grasp due to their highly abstract content. 12</page><page sequence="5">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » By contrast, the cosmograms with specific content, that is, those referring to actual features of relief or units of actual territorial division, are much more difficult to recognize due to the very specificity of their content. The more specific the content of a schematic spatial representation, the less evident is its conventionality 24 . However, it is essential to consider that, as soon as toponyms are incorporated into a scheme, they immediatly become markers of ideally perceived locations or « positions ». Dispersion of these « positions » may only correspond in a fairly loose way to actual topography for the simple reason that the schemes are designed to make it conform to a spatial idea, and the only way to do this is to accept some distortions or violations. Elsewhere I have discussed a conventional image of the world derived from the Shan hai jing (« The Classic of the Mountains and Seas », compiled about the 1st century B. C.) 25 . This is an example of a cosmogram with highly specific content referring to features of relief. The description of the world found in this text is supplied with precise directions and distances between locations, and thus gives an impression of topographical accuracy. Nevertheless, analysis of the system of accounted locations as a whole shows that this description refers to a conceptual organization of space. This conception is expressed in a highly elaborate and ramified form, but it is still a schematic representation with the attributes and characteristics of the latter 26 . In contrast to the Shan hai jing, spatial arrangements of specific principalities/kingdoms include, as a rule, a low number of constitutive elements, have a simple structural organization, and correspond rather satisfactorily to their actual respective locations. At first sight, they may seem to be nothing more than rough approximations of these locations. However, as will be shown in the course of the following discussion, such an arrangement of principalities or kingdoms may still imply a sophisticated political concept. 3. The rise of the interest in kingdoms as objects of conceptualizing space may be traced from the Western Zhou (1046/45/40-771 B. C.) - beginning of the Springs and Autumns period (770-404 B. C.) 21 . This is hardly accidental. It is a manifestation of the fundamental transformations in the political and social structure of Chinese society which started to occur at this time and which made the kingdoms the main actors in political history until the founding of the first Chinese empire, the Empire of Qin (221-207 B.C.)28. These kingdoms originated from the principalities of the Western Zhou state, a quasi-unified political structure founded as a conglomerate of principalities loyal to the Zhou dynasty, and, therefore, already containing the « virus » of disintegration in its organization. By the beginning of the Springs 13</page><page sequence="6">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman and Autumns period, the Western Zhou had disintegrated completely, and the principalities became independent political units, the kingdoms 29 . As the king of Zhou lost his political (but not ritual) authority, the kingdoms started to fight for political leadership, so-called «hegemony30». During the Springs and Autumns the number of kingdoms decreased considerably as the small and weak ones were rapidly annexed by their more successful neighbours. Thus, by the beginning of the Warring States period, according to Chinese historiographical tradition, there were seven main kingdoms left, the so-called « The Seven Mighty » (qi xiong) 31 . These became the principal participants of the fight for power. The limited number of participants, and a sort of balance of power among them, made their competition much more vigorous than before. The institution of « hegemony », that is, a temporary leadership of one kingdom recognized by a considerable number of the others, was no longer appropriate in this situation. Yet, no kingdom had enough power to confront its rivals alone. Under these circumstances a new form of communication between the kingdoms was worked out, the rival war unions. The most important of these unions were referred to as « vertical » (he zong) and « horizontal » (lian heng). Literally, he zong means « to unite along the vertical, that is, South-North axis » and lian heng means « to join together along the horizontal, that is, East- West axis ». Therefore, according to these titles, the kingdoms engaged in the unions were conceived of as being spatially arrayed in some way along the two core axes. Moreover, the « opposition » of the two axes long accepted in Chinese cosmography served to express political relations between the kingdoms. Thus, the kingdoms on the same axis were qualified as « allies », those on the other axis as « enemies ». However, despite the explicit message conveyed by the titles of these unions, many of the extant studies relevant to the political history of the Warring States give surprisingly little consideration to their formal aspect. Cardinally-oriented arrangements of the Seven Mighty Kingdoms found in the Liao di (« Estimating the Enemy ») chapter of the Wu zi32, which I have chosen as an example for detailed examination, are of special interest with respect to this spatial facet of the unions. 4. Now let us take a closer look at the items in question. The Liao di contains a discussion of the war capacities of the Seven Mighty Kingdoms. This discussion reputedly takes place between the philosopher Wu-zi 33 and Wu-hou (386-372 B. C.), the ruler of the kingdom of Wei. In the course of this discussion both the participants use spatial schematic representations of the seven kingdoms as instruments for expressing their points of view on political issues. 14</page><page sequence="7">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » The discussion begins with Wu-hou's description of the dangerous political situation of his kingdom. He says : Qin menaces me from the west ; Chu embraces me from the south ; Zhao hits me from the north ; Qi encloses to me from the east ; Yan cuts me off from behind ; Han blocks me in the front 34 . Hence, this political situation is described by defining the relative « positions » of the six kingdoms with respect to his own, which is taken as the center. If we accept representing each kingdom as a square or rectangle 35 , the « positions » of the kingdoms would form a pattern in the shape of a cross, as shown in figure 2. Thus, Qin, Chu, Zhao and Qi hold the four ultimate peripheral « positions », corresponding to the four cardinal points and arrayed on the four arms of the cross. The « positions » of Yan and Han are given according to the ego-centric anthropomorphic idea of space, with the ruler facing the south as the cross-point of a coordinate system. The kingdom of Yan is placed « behind », that is, as bordering on Wei to the north, and the kingdom of Han is placed « in front », that is, as bordering on Wei to the south, so that all together the three of them share the center of the cross pattern 36 . In response, Wu-zi proposes to discuss the «customs» (su) of the kingdoms referred to by Wu-hou. In his view, the « customs » of a kingdom determine the capacities of its army, and these capacities, in their turn, determine the tactics which should be applied against this specific army. First, he concisely characterizes the armies of the kingdoms in question. These characteristics are as follows : The battle arrays of Qi are of double density, but not solid. The battle arrays of Qin are dispersed, and fight separately. The battle arrays of Chu are regular, but not stable. The battle arrays of Yan are good at defence, but not mobile. The battle arrays of the Three Jin(s) 37 are [perfectly] ordered, but do not function. He then repeats these characteristics in the same order but elaborates on them. In this elaborated version, each of the proposed characteristics is prefaced by the « customs » of the corresponding kingdom, and is followed by directions on how to defeat its army (for a translation of this passage see Appendix 1). 15</page><page sequence="8">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman In contrast to the arrangement of the kingdoms by Wu-hou, Wu-zi does not provide explicit indications of their spatial « positions », except for one exception. In his description of the « customs » of the Three Jin(s), he begins by defining them as « the central kingdoms » (zhong guo). This definition provides the key « angle » which allows us to determine the whole structure. The ascription to the Three Jin(s) of the central « position » implies that the other four kingdoms, Qi, Qin, Chu and Yan, are related to the four cardinal points. Wu-zi may simply have omitted to give their precise locations, taking it for granted that these specific kingdoms could serve as « markers » of the four cardinal directions 38 , east, west, south and north respectively. The derived arrangement of kingdoms (see figure 3a and figure 3b for the concise and the detailed versions respectively) is very similar to, though not exactly the same as, that by Wu-hou. Both arrangements correspond to a cardinally-oriented cruciform pattern with a three-fold central section. It is noteworthy that the set of kingdoms which existed during the period of political disintegration is represented as having a « split » center, thereby expressing the idea of political « disorder ». The main difference between these arrangements lies in the « positions » of Zhao and Yan. In the scheme by Wu-hou, the kingdom of Yan borders Wei on the north, and, therefore, is referred to as one of the group of central kingdoms, whereas Zhao occupies the ultimate northern « position ». According to Wu- zi, the kingdom of Zhao is one of the three central kingdoms, so that Yan has to be referred to as the ultimate northern state. Actually, Yan was situated much further to the north than Zhao (see map 1). It was the most northern principality under the Western Zhou dynasty, and the most northern kingdom during the Springs and Autumns and the Warring States periods. As such, as mentioned above, it could serve as a « marker » of the north. Moreover, Wei did not have a common border with Yan at all, whereas Zhao was not only its closest northern neighbour, but also originated at the same moment and from the same kingdom as Wei. The spatial representation of the seven kingdoms derived from the references to them by Wu-zi corresponds in a more appropriate way to their respective locations. It seems most likely that this representation reflected the acknowledged « positions » of the Seven Mighty Kingdoms. Under these circumstances, Wu- hou, who advanced a different arrangement, had to be more precise about his assignment of each « position ». If one addresses the historical context of this period, some data may be discovered which helps to understand the reasons why Wu-hou inverted the « positions » of Yan and Zhao. In the second year of his rulership, the kingdom of Wei began a war with Zhao, and was defeated. So, at the time when the discussion reputedly took place, relations between the two kingdoms were tense. This tension may clearly be seen from a comparison of the « actions » 16</page><page sequence="9">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » of kingdoms directed against Wei, as defined by Wu-hou and referred to above. The kingdom of Zhao « hits » Wei and, therefore, is referred as its active « enemy », whereas all the other kindoms hold a sort of passive opposition. However, there is, in fact, a rigid criterion according to which the kingdoms of Wei, Yan and Han differ considerably from the other four kingdoms, and have an « authority » allowing them to be placed in the center, as found in Wu- hou 's cosmogram. This criterion is the family name of a ruler. The rulers of Wei, Yan and Han shared the same family name with the Zhou dynasty (Qi), while the rulers of the four other kingdoms had differing family names (Zhao and Qin - Ying, Qi - Jiang, since 386 B. C. Tian, Chu - Mi). By using this criterion for arranging the kingdoms, Wu-hou was able to assert that he was one of the direct inheritors of the Zhou dynasty, and, in this way, to clearly mark off his own kingdom from Zhao, despite their common origins 39 . In brief, by « pushing off » the kingdom of Zhao to the ultimate northern «position», Wu-hou expressed specific political relations between the two kingdoms at the time when his discussion with Wu-zi took place. It is of central importance that even a minor alteration in « positions » of the kingdoms is significant, since it changes the whole set of relationships between the kingdoms represented. From this perspective, Wu-zi's statement that the Three Jin(s) are the central kingdoms may be understood as a strong objection to Wu- hou 's scheme. Moreover, the reference to the kingdoms of Zhao, Wei and Han as the Three Jin(s) gives Wu-zi an opportunity to advance implicit criticism of the rulership of Wu-hou himself, as everything said about the Three Jin(s) concerns the kingdom of Wei as well. As far as the arrangement of kingdoms according to Wu-zi is concerned, the detailed one in particular is of special interest, as it gives an account of the qualitative characteristics of each kingdom, thereby showing the « ratings » of their « positions » 40 . The « customs » of a kingdom, according to Wu-zi, include its « nature » (x ing), always given at the beginning, followed by the character of its government and people, quality of land, etc. The order of the latter characteristics varies, and they are presented in a less formal manner than the « nature ». Yet, in general, the characteristics of the kingdoms give an impression not unlike that one would get from the filling out of forms 41 . The « nature » of a kingdom seems to be directly related to its « position ». Thus, the « nature » of the Three Jin(s), which hold the central « position », is « harmonious » (he). By contrast, the kingdoms holding the peripheral « positions » have extreme qualities : the « nature » of Qi is « hard » (gang), of Qin is « strong » (qiang), of Chu is « weak » (ruo), and of Yan is « sincere &amp; careful » (que), with the implication of being too « simple-minded ». Moreover, an opposition of the « natures » of kingdoms placed on different axes may be traced. Thus, the « nature » of the kingdoms arrayed on the 17</page><page sequence="10">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman horizontal axis is « hard/strong », and of those on the vertical axis « weak/sincere &amp; careful » 42 . The government is « balanced » (ping) in the center, and unbalanced in a different way at the extremities (with Yan as an exception, as no characteristic for its government is provided). Thus, the government of Qin is « severe » (xian), that of Chu is « violating the rules/order » (sao), the government of Qi is « unconstrained » ( kuan ), and the « salaries » (lu) in the kingdom of Qi are « unbalanced » (bu jun). Although the government of the kingdom of Yan is not characterized, the characteristics of its people are too detailed when compared to the other kingdoms holding cardinally-oriented « positions » (« Its people are cautious ( shen ), love courage (yong) and the duty /rules (yi), rarely deceive (zha) [and] make sophisticated plans (mou) »). The idea of respect to « duty /rules » seems to provide a certain opposition to the characteristic of the government of Chu, which is « violating the rules/order » 43 . The characteristics of the governments of Qin and Qi are pure antonyms (« severe » - « unconstrained »). So, the governments of the kingdoms arrayed at each end of the horizontal axis have contrasting characteristics. The same might be said of the characteristics of the government of Chu and those of the people of Yan, the kingdoms arrayed at each end of the vertical axis. The armies of the Three Jin(s) are characterized as « ordered » (zhi). Yet, these armies « do not function » (bu yong), as something absolutely balanced does not move ! The armies of the kingdoms holding ultimate « positions » are disordered in a different way. Thus, the battle arrays of Qin and Qi are « dispersed » (san) and « of double density » (chong) respectively, the battle arrays of Chu are « regular », but this regularity is not stable (bu jiu), so this is not the perfect « order » of the center, while those of Yan are only good at « defence » (shou). Just as the characteristics of the governments of Qin and Qi are contrasting, so are those of their armies. In brief, there is a considerable correlation between the « position » of a kingdom and its characteristics, or, in other words, the characteristics of a kingdom are to a considerable extent determined by the « position » ascribed to it44. These characteristics are involved in a complex interplay of relationships : some are similar along the same axis and contrasting along different axes, others are contrasting at the ultimate points of an axis. It also seems of some interest that the relationships with respect to the horizontal axis are articulated in a much more consistent way than those of the vertical axis 45 . The account of the characteristics of kingdoms provided by Wu-zi shows what a complex system of relationships may be hidden behind a simple cardinally-oriented arrangement of kingdoms. 18</page><page sequence="11">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » Conclusions The examination of the spatial arrangements of the Seven Mighty Kingdoms, found in the Liao di chapter of the Wu-zi , provides a good illustration of how a framework for conceptualizing space was used for conveying political ideas. Representing a set of kingdoms as a combination of spatial « positions » served as a means to establish a sophisticated system of relationships between these kingdoms. A well-balanced and harmonious system of relationships expressed a certain political statement. From this viewpoint, the relationships between the kingdoms, and, consequently, the conveyed political idea, change dramatically with the alterations in their « positions ». The principles and patterns according to which the ancient Chinese conceptualized space effected the determining of these « positions ». Thus, the « ratings » of the represented kingdoms, and the system of relationships between them, no matter whether this representation corresponded to their actual respective locations or not, were determined by the « ratings » of their « positions » and the relationships among these « positions » in the classification of space according to these principles and patterns. The spatial representations of the Seven Mighty Kingdoms shed new light on the « vertical » and « horizontal » unions concluded between them during the Warring States period. It is at least tempting to suppose that these « unions » were conceived of as a system of complementary sets of « positions » which filled out a definite spatial pattern. This spatial pattern conveyed a picture of political differentiation of the world into two rival unions correlated with the the core axes, and the division of power over the delineated sections of the world between the members of these unions 46 . The intrusion of spatial thinking into Chinese political thought poses a series of new questions concerning the constraining effects this might have. For example, to what extent the choice of partners in the « vertical » - « horizontal » unions, and the choice of the number of the Mighty Kingdoms of the Warring States period in Chinese historiographical tradition were determined by the principles of conceptualizing space. One may also question why Wu-zi, who visited many other kingdoms, chose to have this discussion with the ruler of Wei in order to put forward his political concept. It seems very likely that his choice was inspired by the « position » of Wei among the other kingdoms as being the most appropriate for that of the « observer ». 19</page><page sequence="12">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman Notes 1 . This paper was written under the auspices of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. I would like to thank Karine Chemla for valuable comments on the first draft of this paper. My special thanks to John Moffett for corrections of my English. Any mistakes found in this paper are my own responsibility. 2. A brief historical survey of these geo-political units will be given below. 3 . E.g., multiple references to « the principalities of the four cardinal directions » (si guo) are found in the Shi jing (ca. llth-6th centuries B.C.), namely, 6, 3 and 5 references in the Da ya, Xiao y a and Guo f eng sections respectively. A typologically similar, yet much more elaborate cardinally-oriented distribution of principalities is found in a considerably later text, the Wang zhi chapter of the Li ji (the extant version of this compilation emerged probably as late as the 1st century A. D.). Here a precise normative number of principalities is given for each of « The Nine Provinces », one of the basic Chinese cosmograms represented as a cardinally-oriented 3x3 grid (see below). The central « province », corresponding to the domain of the Son of Heaven, should include 93 principalities (9,21 and 63 with the area equal to the area of a square with a side of 100, 70 and 50 respectively). Each of the other eight « provinces », corresponding to the eight directions, includes 210 principalities (30, 60 and 120 with the area as indicated above). In total there are 1 773 principalites (SBBY ed., ll/5a- 6b ; J. Legge, trans. [1885, vol. 27, p. 211-212]). 4. E.g., in the Guo yu , in the opening section of its Zheng yu chapter (not earlier than 314 B. C.), an account of principalities surrounding Chengzhou (Luoyi) is provided. The arrangement of the principalities found in this passage is as follows : eight principalities are arrayed to the east and to the west of Chengzhou respectively, and eight principalities plus a land of barbarians to the south and to the north of it respectively (SBBY ed., 16/la ; V. S. Taskin, trans. [1987, p. 238-243 (§ 209)]). Another good example is found in the Zhuang zi , the Dao zhi chapter (ca. 200 B.C.). Here Confucius suggests to Robber Zhi that he visits as his ambassador « the kingdoms of Wu and Yue in the south, Qi and Lu in the north, Song and Wei in the east, Jin and Chu in the west. » (Zhuangzi jishi , ZZJC ed., 1935, vol. 3, p. 428 ; A. C. Graham, trans. [1991 , p. 236] ; L. D. Posdneeva, trans. [1994, p. 330] ; V. V. Malyavin, trans. [1995, p. 253]). In this way, an arrangement of four pairs of kingdoms distributed in the four cardinal directions is advanced. 5 . Elsewhere I have made an attempt to reconstruct a spatial arrangement of principalities behind the structure of the Guo feng section of the Shi jing , see V. Dorofiéiéva- Lichtmann [1991]. 6. I would like to stress that definitions of Chinese spatial conceptions as « ideal », « speculative », « conventional », « symbolic » etc. reflect the point of view of modern science. 7. For a thorough study of the history of Chinese cartography, and for a comprehensive and up-to-date bibliography, see the corresponding chapters by Cordell Yee and John B. Henderson in : J. B. Harley, D. Woodward, eds. [1994]. A new important study is expected to be published shortly, see R. J. Smith [1996]. I would also like to point out 20</page><page sequence="13">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » a pioneering study by Edouard Chavannes [1903] which served as a basis for the survey of the history of Chinese cartography by Joseph Needham [1959]. Although this research by Edouard Chavannes was done long before the Qin and Han maps were excavated, it contains important insights into the distinctive features of Chinese cartography which are still pertinent today. 8. See Hsu Mei-ling [1984, 1988, 1993], F. C. Reiter [1990, p. 310-311]. This problematic is given special consideration by Cordell Yee, see J. B. Harley, D. Woodward, eds. [1994, p. 53-65, 228]. 9. This explanation is proposed by Hsu Mei-ling [1988, p. 10]. This means that modern maps and Chinese maps differ markedly in their code of conventional terrestrial representation. 1 0 . For the implications of the character tu , see M . Lackner [ 1 990 , 1 992] , F. Reiter [ 1 990] . By the end of the 1st millenium B. C. a sub-class of «conventional terrestrial representations » appears, that is the di tu. The earliest references are found in the Zhan guo ce [SBBY ed., 19/2b (§218) ; 31/5b and 6a (§440, 2 references)], the Zhou li (SBCK ed., 2/20a ; 3/25a), and the Guan zi , ch.27 (10/7a-b). This term is usually considered to stand for geographical maps, though the interpretations of some of its earliest applications in this way is hardly certain, and, as may be seen clearly from comparison with the other instances of the character tu in these texts, the attribute di is facultative and quite often omitted in similar constructions. The term di tu could with the same degree of probablity designate a cosmogram. The six principles of precise cartography, proposed by the Jin scholar Pei Xu (A. D. 224-271), (see J. Needham [1959, p. 538-543]) did not become widespread in Chinese cartography, and, therefore, should not be recognized as criteria for distinguishing between maps and cosmograms. All this indicates that if there were attempts to distinguish maps from cosmograms, this was done not earlier than the end of the 1st millenium B.C., and most likely not earlier than the 3rd century A. D., with the final process of differentiation between maps and cosmograms not being completed until the diffusion of modern European science. In any case, the difference between maps and cosmograms was not regarded as significant in Chinese thought, and was not rigidly determined. 11. A square grid and a nest of concentric squares are symbolised in Chinese cosmographie tradition by two cosmograms respectively - « The Nine Provinces » (Jiu zhou) and « The Five Zones (Layers) »(Wufu). For a general survey of these two cosmograms with a comparison of some of their variations, see J. S . Major [1984]. The locus classicus for both of these cosmograms is the most authoritative ancient Chinese terrestrial description, the Yu gong chapter (ca. 5th-4th centuries B.C., probably even as late as the 3rd century B. C.) of the Shang shu (Shangshu zhengyi, SBBY ed., 6/1 a- 19b ; B. Karlgren, trans. [1950, p. 12-18 ; 1948, glosses 1352-1396]). 12. For the reconstruction and interpretation of a cruciform pattern with respect to early Chinese culture, see S. Allan [1991, p. 74-111]. She argues that this was the shape of the Earth as understood by the Shang (ca. 16th- 11th centuries B.C.). 13. The conventional image of the earth's surface accepted in Chinese cosmography is a square, in contrast to the heavens, which is conceived of as a circle. The earliest 21</page><page sequence="14">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman reference to this idea expressed in explicit form (tian yuan di fang) is found in the Huai nan zi, SBBY ed., 3/9a, and in the opening section of the astronomical and mathematical classic Zhou bi suan jing , see Qian Baocong, ed. [1963, p. 4] ; see also Huai nan zi , 3/ lb ; 15/3a. Each of the three patterns referred to above conveys the square symbolic image of the Earth in its own way. According to the grid system and the Greek cross, the terrestrial surface is divided into equal checks of the grid or square units in such a way that each check or unit reproduces the symbolic form of the earth. The concentric squares, differing in their area, successively reproduce the earth's contours from its borders to the center. 14. It should also be noted that some of the principles of constructing cosmograms frequently determined the design of maps, e.g., application of a square coordinate grid, representation of a piece of land in a shape close to a square. 15. This framework is characterized by two remarkable properties : the compatibility of the basic patterns (see J.S. Major [1984, p. 143-145]), and their complementarity (see V. Dorofeeva-Lichtmann [1995, p. 66-69]). Complementarity is also typical of Chinese cartographic tradition, which accepts the coexistence of maps representing the same territories from differing points of view and according to differing formats. Good examples of these are provided by the Song maps, representing China and peripheral lands : Yu yi tu and Hua yi tu (see Edouard Chavannes [1903]), and the maps related to the Six Classics ( Liu jing tu), (see Wang Qianjin [1993]). The first two maps are of special interest in this case, as they are engraved on the two sides of a stone. Edouard Chavannes and Wang Qianjin explain the considerable differences between the maps by their having originated from different authors. However, this explanation covers only a part of a question, and obscures its core, that is, that these representations could both exist at the same time. The polyparadigmatic character of Chinese scientific tradition is pointed out by P. U. Unschuld [1984, p. 6-8 ; 1987] with respect to Chinese medicine. He suggests that the monoparadigmatic preference of Western science could somehow be linked to the Judeo-Christian emphasis on monotheism. 16. I distinguish transformation from distortion. The latter is inevitable in any representation of the earth's surface, e.g., projection of its round surface onto a flat surface in modern cartography. 17. A gradual descending of « value » from the central square towards the periphery is clearly articulated in all the variations of cosmograms constructed as a nest of concentric squares : « The Five Zones (Layers) », « The Seven Zones (Layers) » (the Zhou yu section of the Guo yu , l/2a-3a, reproduced in the Zhou ben ji chapter of the Shi ji, 1972, vol.1, p. 135-136), « The Nine Zones » (the Zhifang shi chapter of the Zhou li , CBCK ed., 8/27b-28a), and « The Nine Outlying Areas » (Jiu ji) (the Da si ma chapter of the Zhou li , 7/llb-12a). 18. For a general survey of the references to the Ming tang in classical texts and for the development of this cosmographie conception, see H. Maspero [1948-1951], W. E. Soothill [1951, p. 84-96], L. Sickman and A. Soper [1959, p. 212], J. B. Henderson [1984, p. 59-87]. 19. SBBY ed., 31/lb ; J. Legge, trans. [1985, vol. 28, p. 29-30], Séraphin Couvreur, trans. [1913, p. 725-728]. The translation of the Ming tang as « A Hall of Distinction » 22</page><page sequence="15">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » proposed by James Legge seems to be much closer to the idea conveyed in the text than the more current « The Hall of Light » originating from « Le palais de la lumière » by Séraphin Couvreur. 20. This ceremony is supposed to have taken place regularly under the rulers of the Zhou dynasty (1046/45/40-256 B.C.). For a survey of a discussion concerning the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty, see S. Nivison [1990, p. 155-160]. This text dating from a considerably later period provides an idealized version of this ceremony. 21. There were five ranks of the governors of principalities under the Zhou dynasty, namely, gong , hou, bo, zi and nan. 22. Application of these patterns indicates that space in China was perceived of as qualitatively nonhomogeneous, and quantitatively discontinued and finite. This is typical of conventional images of the world generated by certain pre-modern cultures, and, to some extent, to those elaborated within so-called « primitive » societies, e.g. see M. Eliade [1961, p. 37-56]. For a brief survey of pre-modern terrestrial representations, see R. V. Tooley [1949, p. 1-13], L. Bagrow [1966, p. 19-58]. The latter work is supplied with excellent illustrations. 23. At the same time, the ancient Chinese used a system of «absolute» angles of orientation, the cardinal points. The peculiarity of the Chinese view is that these « absolute » angles are correlated with the anthropomorphic ego-centric conception of space, that is, with the view of space in relative terms. Here the cross-point of the coordinate axes is marked by the ruler facing the south. Thus, the « front » corresponds to the « south », the « back » to the « north », the « left side » to the « east », the « right side » to the « west ». 24. A good illustration of this confusion is provided by the variations of « The Nine Provinces ». According to the Yu gong , the boundaries between the « provinces » are referred to by specific geographical features (rivers, mountains and the sea). There are no references to the cardinal orientation of the « provinces », or direct statements that they are conceived of as checks of a square grid. Some of these attributes of a schematic representation emerge in the following texts dating from the late Warring States (403-222 B.C.) - Former Han (206 B. C. - A. D.8) periods : the You shi Ian chapter (section I) of the Liishi chunqiu, the Zhi fang shi chapter of the Zhou li , the Shi di chapter of the Er ya and the Wang zhi chapter of the Li ji. A purely schematic view of « The Nine Provinces » is consistently articulated in the Di xing xun (this concept is focused on by J. S. Major [1984 ; 1993, p. 141-147]). Nevertheless, the claim that « The Nine Provinces », as found in the Yu gong , convey a « naturalistic » idea of terrestrial division which gradually developed into a schematic representation (see J. S. Major [1984, p. 137-140], J. B. Henderson [1984, p. 66-68]) seems rather too simplistic an approach to the problem. The description of the « provinces » in the Yu gong is also done in a formal, though more sophisticated way, by means of a multi- item scale for classifying the « provinces » (see V. Dorofeeva-Lichtmann [1995, p. 64- 65]) 25. V. Dorofeeva-Lichtmann [1995]. 26. Similar ideas have been advanced by D. Porter [1993, p. 76-79] with respect to locations, Kunlun mountain in particular, listed in the Mu Tianzi zhuan , a source 23</page><page sequence="16">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman closely connected with the Shan hai jing. This point of view contrasts markedly with the majority of extant researches originating from traditional commentaries, which seek to provide exact identification of locations. The cause of this intention in commentaries to the referred texts is of much interest and, as such, deserves special exploration. 27. I distinguish the Springs and Autumns as a period of the Chinese history (770- 404 B.C.) from the period described in the Chun qiu (722-481 B.C.). 28. For a detailed study of the fundamental transformations in Chinese society during the Springs and Autumns and the Warring States periods, see Hsu Cho-yun [1965]. 29. Nevertheless, the rulers of the kingdoms started to use the title «king» (wang) relatively late. The first ruler who dared to do this was king Zhuang of Chu (613- 591 B.C.). Prior to this only the rulers of the Zhou dynasty had the authority to bear this title. Thus, until the middle of the Springs and Autumns period, the kingdoms were still formally considered as principalities dependent on the Zhou dynasty. 30. « Hegemony » may be considered as a form of centralisation : the kingdoms submitted to the most powerful among them for the time being. 31 . These seven kingdoms are as follows : Qi, Qin, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Wei and Han. 32. ZZJC ed., 1935, vol. 6, p. 3-4 ; P. Amiot, trans. [1772, p. 183-190], N. Conrad (Konrad), trans. [1958, 28-30], S.B. Griffith, trans. [1963, p. 154-156], R. D. Sawyer, trans. [1993, p. 210-211]. 33. About Wu-zi himself and his treatise, see R. D. Sawyer, trans. [1993, p. 191-203]. 34. Translations here and below are my own. 35. Square and rectangle are not distinguished in Chinese mathematics (both are designated by the character fang). I prefere the square/rectangular shape for a conventional image of a kingdom, as shown on figures 2-3, because of frequent definitions of kingdoms in ancient Chinese texts by their area, given as the area of a square with a side of N li. 36. It should be noted that the « positions » of Qin and Qi are also defined according to the ego-centric anthropomorphic idea of space, that is, as to the « right » and the « left », but in an implicit way. This is done through the specific characters which are used to designate the actions of these kingdoms directed against Wei, namely, xie and lin respectively. Both these characters convey the idea of a « side ». 37. The title of the Three Jin(s) refers to the kingdoms of Zhao, Han and Wei, the former parts of Jin divided into three in 403 B. C. In fact the final division occurred later, in 376 B. C. In 403 B. C. the rulers of Zhao, Wei and Han were recognized as governors of principalities by the king of Zhou. 38. See, e.g., the Yan tie lun, §5 (Jin g eng), CBCK ed., 1/lOb. In this passage, dating from the former Han period, the names of the four kingdoms, which did not exist any more, are used exactly in this way. 39. The classification of principalities according to the family names of their rulers may be derived from the set of principalities selected to entitle the groups of texts of the Guofeng section of the Shi jing, see V. Dorofiéréva-Lichtmann [1991 , p. 90-91 , Table 9, column VII]. 24</page><page sequence="17">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » 40. In some cases, the « rating » of a territory may be expressed through quantitative characteristics, see V. Dorofeeva-Lichtmann [1995, p. 72-73]. 41 . This way of classifying the kingdoms may be compared to a multi-item scale. 42. The rigidity of this opposition seems a little strained by the character que. Yet, being « sincere &amp; careful » with the implication of being too « simple-minded » may be regarded as a kind of « weakness ». 43. It is possible that the passage addressed to the kingdom of Yan is slightly corrupted, and a part of the characteristics of its people refers actually to its government. 44. E.g., a kingdom which holds a peripheral « position » may not be balanced. The idea that the characteristics of a territory correlate with its spatial « position » was developed further during the Han dynasty, see Yu L. Kroll [1973, 1978]. 45. This may have some basis in the historical context of the period when the discussion between Wu-zi and Wu-hou took place and when the Wu-zi was compiled. Thus, according to the conclusion to the Chen She shi jia chapter of the Shiji [1972, vol. 6, p. 1962], around the middle of the fourth century B.C., under the rulership of Xiao- gong (361-338) of Qin, the « horizontal » union began to form, the first in the system of « vertical »-« horizontal » unions. The system of unions, however, deserves a detailed study which is far beyond the scope of this paper. 46. Thus, in 288 B. C. the rulers of Qin and Qi, having concluded a « horizonal » union, accepted the titles of « The Emperor of the West » (Xi di) and « The Emperor of the East » ( Dong di) respectively.

Its kingdom is rich. The ruler and the ministers are arrogant [and] extravagant, and neglect the ordinary people. Its government is unconstrained, and salaries are unbalanced. A battle array has two heart/minds, the front is heavy, the rear is light. Therefore, « [the battle arrays of Qi] are of double density, but not solid ». The way to attack them [is as follows] : It is necessary to divide them into three. To hunt them down from left and right, while squeezing [them from the flanks], to follow them. [Eventually, ] its battle arrays can be destroyed. 2. The « nature » of Qin is strong. Its land is rugged. Its government is severe. Its rewards and punishments are trustworthy. Its people do not yield, all have aggressive heart/minds. Therefore, « [the battle arrays of Qin] are dispersed, and fight separately ». The way to attack them [is as follows] : It is necessary first to point them to some profit and make them go for it. The soldiers are hungry for loot and will leave their generals. [Then it is necessary] to follow [them], to hunt [them] down and scatter [them], to establish ambushes, to take advantage of the moment. [Eventually, ] their generals can be seized. 3. The « nature » of Chu weak. Its land is extensive. Its government violates the rules/order. 28</page><page sequence="21">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » Its people are exhausted. Therefore, [the battle arrays of Chu] are regular, but not stable. The way to attack them [is as follows] : Strike suddenly [and] cause chaos in their camps. First snatch away their qi. [Then] make light advances, quick retreats, [in order to] exhaust and tire them. [One] should not get engaged in full-scale battle with them. [Eventually, ] their army can be defeated. 4. The « nature » of Yan is sincere/careful (with the implication of being too « simple- minded »). Its people are cautious, love courage and the duty /rules, rarely deceive [and] make sophisticated plans. Therefore, [« the battle arrays of Yan] are good at defence, but not mobile ». The way to attack them [is as follows] : Butt and press them, insult [them] and withdraw to a distance, [and then] race and get behing them. Under these circumstances their upper ranks will become doubtful and lower ranks fearful. [One should] take care of one's own chariots and cavalry, and should choose roundabout roads. [Eventually, ] their generals can be captured. 5. As far as the Three Jin(s) are concerned, [these] are the Central Kingdoms. Their « natures » are harmonious. Their governments are balanced. Their peoples are exhausted by war, [and] experienced in arms, have little esteem for their generals, [and] are indifferent to their salaries. The officers have no commitment to fight to the death. Therefore, « [the battle arrays of the Three Jin(s)] are [perfectly] ordered, but do not function ». The way to attack them is [as follows] : Block the way [in front of] their battle arrays and hamper them. If [they] approach en masse , resist them. If [they] depart, pursue them By means of these their armies can be worn out. 29</page><page sequence="22">Véra Dorofeeva-Lichtman Figure la S - I - I I I 1 I E S w 1 I I I - i N Figure lb S i- 1 j 1 1 - ¡ - E ļļļ w 1 I 1 j I N Figure lc S ^ - I - i - i 1 i ' ' ' I / ' 1 ' I / I I ' I / i I c I E ļ. w 7 i - N 30</page><page sequence="23">Political concept behind an interplay of spatial « positions » Figure 2 J- t™- "** * I 0 « 8 œ s SsBBjS ^ * Numbers in corners refer to the original numbers of the phrases/kingdoms in the Wu-zi.
