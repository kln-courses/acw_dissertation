<plain_text><page sequence="1">Metaphorical Thinking and the Scope of Literature R. J. KAUFMANN Nature has made all her truths independent of one another. Our art makes one dependent on the other. But this is not natural. Each keeps its own place. -Pascal No doubt Metaphors are dangerous-and perhaps especially so in philosophy. But a prohibition against their use would be a harmful restriction upon our powers of inquiry. -Max Black Mastery of metaphor is the one thing which can not be learned from somebody else. Aristotle THE WORK OF THE "NEW CRITICS" prom- ised too much. It was a method, narrow and timely. The "New Criticism" opened eyes and it created a useful tech- nology for training readers of complex texts, but its obligatory polemics deriving from its early stages of self-vindication became confused with a general descrip- tion of the whole critical act, so that something close to the Functionalist ap- proach promoted by anthropologists like Malinowski was gradually canonized in unwary quarters. When standardized through success "New Criticism" lost its glamor, historical critics-lifted a modest step towards verbal sophistication by their exposure to several decades of "New Critical" practice-were able to make some sort of comeback. But the excitement had fled, for there was no radical increment of novelty in this re- storation, only a revisionary assimilation of a method which time had domesti- cated. Moreover, subsequent critical ex- cursions into disciplines adjacent to liter- ature have usually been raids rather than patient explorations. It is modish to pos- sess sophisticated booty from exotic methodologies, but few of us are impolite enough to demand evidence of a native ac- cent when these borrowings are recited. Hence we live in a syncretistic age when a stylized Freudianism, an auto- matic analytical formalism, a rehabili- tated notion of the genres, a tincture of Leavisite social severity, certain genea- logical adaptations of Lovejoy's evolu- tionary techniques for tracking "ideas," and borrowed iconographical expertise in establishing "period" are mixed and matched by each practicing critic- scholar to suit his notions of procedural decorum. With a few gratifying excep- tions, and despite local virtuosities, frankly, most current critical writing is intellectually slack. Somehow the old sense of engagement is gone. This is es- pecially regrettable at a time when rigor- ous literary thinking on questions of a larger than rhetorical scope is once again feasible in the public realm. Many students arrive at the university already somewhat blase, well exposed to the mysteries of explication and adept at unpacking ironies. Such rituals don't interest them much. Their active con- cerns are for macro-questions having to do with matters of linkage-interpersonal, R. 1. Kaufmann teaches Intellectual History and Literature at the University of Rochester.

They want to know how alienation and its opposite, social communion, develop. They like to read texts that invent or fabricate world views. Their most press- ing curiosities are related to their desire to discover well-founded arguments against "tuning out," or which alter- nately provide telling reasons for doing so. It is graceless and myopic to con- demn their preference for the lebens- philosophie of Camus, Nietzsche, Kierke- gaard, Dostoevsky, Freud, N. O. Brown and Erikson as adolescent. They have problems and aspirations different from those of us whose first intellectual en- gagement dates from the twenties, thir- ties, or forties-even, believe it or not- from those who reached their majority in the drab and depoliticized fifties. I don't suggest that we should stop study- ing and teaching Henry James or Milton, Pope or Hemingway-Shakespeare, of course as a transcendent genius, takes care of himself in any epoch-but we can profit from further thinking about criti- cal method and about the way major shifts in historical climate change not only the nature of the literature which we can now produce but also the appre- ciability and the status of all antecedent literature as well. The epoch in which we are living-one drained of vital ideologi- cal substance-is re-stretching the scope of literature to Victorian dimensions, so that it once again includes imaginative thinking in the major non-fictional forms. Rigid, neo-traditional critical procedures tend to creak and groan when matched against these more open, generative and referential literary forms. In this essay, I want to discuss and reason about the inner structure of some texts that are usually classified too nar- rowly to release their pertinence to the current generation of students and to examine this matter of psycho-cultural linkage. My primary concern will be, consequently, for an ampler conception of metaphor. If we work close enough to the grain of metaphoric generation we can see that human use of metaphor is often constitu- tive, because controlled metaphorical stipulations establish the imaginative matrix for human growth. Basic meta- phors mark points of vital cultural ca- thexsis; by stipulation, energy is invested; the stipulations provide foci for practical allegiance, and these are coordinated gradually into a field of authentic con- cern. Since at our innocent beginnings, we believe these conjunctions of sight and word to be presuppositionless, this network of fused metaphoric equations comes to constitute our residual, social- ized self. Metaphor, at this constitutive level, then works as an instrument of cultural repression which superimposes itself between us and whatever thoughts or feelings we might have had. Meta- phorical acculturation is the ground for our historicity. Such diagrammatic pre- sentation needs expansion, exemplification and testing. We can start by examining three in- stances of advanced metaphorical think- ing, one each by Sir Thomas More, Kant and Pascal. The method is deliberately casual, for, in a manner consistent with the special quality of metaphor, I seek to show how something can be viewed and thought about, not to construct a proof. Each analyzed example has been chosen to display different active properties of metaphor as these bear upon evaluation of the historically crucial texts in which they occur. Works of the imagination are greatly varied. There are many ways to classify them. Often this is done according to subject matter, sometimes by sociological domain, sometimes by rhetorical mode, sometimes by judgment of their putative truth content. Often it is by some short- hand combination of these. Suppose we seek to classify More's Utopia. We can say it is a fantasy-hence it is not non- fictional. We bridge this gap by saying it is in a sense symbolic, and we make</page><page sequence="3">METAPHORICAL THINKING 33 topical correlations between Hythloday's diatribes against European political mores and the events of early-modern conti- nental history. We say it is "philosophi- cal," by which we mean it is concerned with truths more comprehensive than its topicalities might indicate. But then we say its satiric argument is dramatized, by which we suggest that the generali- ties it reaches after are to that extent particularized and embodied. Hence we arrive by a kind of pendular movement at something that would do credit to Polonius's "tragical-comical-historical- pastoral, scene individable, or poem un- limited." In the process we give a war- rant to every kind of methodological partiality which readers betray in their exploitation of the text. There is no im- portant purpose served by mere categori- zation in the handling of a text of suffi- cient imaginative force to benefit the questing historian. If a way of dealing with experience has become general enough to form a readily circumscribed class, it has likely lost its initial intimate relationship to emergent historical reali- ties, and therefore its special merit as an imaginative source. Let me try to show a more immediate way to deal with his unusual text. The first notable pre-critical point is that More's little book is the first effort in the modern imaginative canon to conjure up a critical, wholly "other" picture of an organized human environment and to give it a physical locus in the world. The second pre-critical fact is that the Utopia is in two parts: the first dedicated to describing the pride-riddled and socially maimed condition of contemporary Europe: the second dedicated to a de- scription of the non-prideful and socially healthy counter image, Utopia. The link between the two is a carefully contrived persona, Raphael Hythloday. We find of him that he is alienated from Europe where he refuses the role of King's counsellor for which his talents qualify him, and that he is "at home" in Utopia. In Swift's Gulliver's Travels, for exam- ple, such a basic division between the eulogistic and dyslogistic aspects of one's social responses is avoided. Swift's Gul- liver, as it were, earns his alienation in the process of voyaging; it is not pre- supposed. Why, we ask, this diptych structure in the Utopia? To one sensitized to metaphorical dis- course the manifest "state of affairs" Hythloday reports to exist in Utopia is already latently prefigured in the adapta- tion More makes of one of the basic metaphors of western discourse: "life is a voyage." The Utopia is complex in tone, because the collision of ethical priorities which is expressed in the great dramatic poems of the late Elizabethan and Jacobean age is here only nascently active. More felt the pressure of conflict- ing systems for evaluating personal choices, but he resolved the dilemma before (not in) the process of composi- tion. The two visions are juxtaposed, not dialectically interlocked. More, for all his saintliness, was not capable of wholesale repudiation of societal ties in the inter- ests of radical salvation, he had no in- stinct for the kind of clear-cut resolution of priorities with which Bunyan's Chris- tian inaugurates his pilgrimage in another imaginative rendering of the radical metaphor: "life is a voyage." It is a premise of the later book that Christian leave his family behind and go into the unknown alone, but in the Utopia it is the alienated Hythloday who "is not greatly concerned about" friends and relatives and who has already done his "duty towards them" who voyages to Utopia. In assigning the voyage to "no- where" to this humanly unrelated per- sona, the issue has been dramatically pre- judged. Hythloday sails as "Plato sailed" the text informs us. One might say his voyage is towards an historically irre- sponsible sophrosyne, and, being a special form of the contemplative quest, it lies across "vast deserts parched with per- petual heat of the sun. The whole region</page><page sequence="4">34 COLLEGE ENGLISH is desolate and gloomy, savage and uncul- tivated, inhabited by wild beasts and serpents, and by a few men as wild and dangerous as the beasts themselves." But, in this concise valuative landscape, "As they went on, conditions gradually grew milder. The heat was less burning, the earth greener, and even the beasts less fierce" (Utopia, p. 3). Utopia lies in the symbolic latitudes of the Chapel Perilous; to get there the seeker passes beyond the tropical sun of mundane passions and connections (the haughty kings of Part One are identified with the sun) to the temperate zone-the green pastures be- yond tension and the exposed conditions of political ambition or service. To get there one must travel without human ties. The movement of the book is away from the regal sun of pride and the deserts of expediency to another state. But it is not More who goes the journey. The complexities of his own auctorial- surrogate called "I" in the text have prompted much interesting controversy. This figure is alternately wise and fool- ish, sympathetic and mildly carping; he assents and then he denies. The problem dissolves once we root ourself in the basic imaginative stratum of the text. To arrive in utopia (a sort of desacramental- ized, temperate condition beyond money, beyond personal attachment, beyond ethical complexity) one must make the antecedent repudiation which More was fractionally tempted to but could not make. Utopia or "nowhere" is not out- side psychological actuality but it is out- side moral reality for a man humanly en- gaged. Much in More drew him to the temperate exemptions of the Utopians, but still stronger elements in him held him back. It is no accidental feature of this economical little book that it begins (literally) in a state of homesickness when More is away from home. There is something deeply Thoreauvian in More. His "journeys" were not really ventures from home, but ways of reconciling him- self to what he has and to what he is. Speaking metaphorically, the Utopia in- dicates a More who is a staff for others to lean on or perhaps a tree to shade and protect others from the harsh sun of royal caprice rather than the voyager himself. It is often claimed that there is a break in inner continuity between the More who wrote Utopia in 1517-a man critical of the thankless role of royal counsellor-and the older More who ac- cepted the seal of office and died a victim of his miscalculation of his powers of suasion. An adequate respect for the metaphorical structure of his Utopia argues that the artistic decision to em- ploy the alienated Hythloday as his philosophical voyager already contained his later personal decision. Historians must work with imaginative constructions more and less formal than More's Utopia. Kant's Critique of Pure Reason has a lower metaphorical quotient than most crucial books, but even it af- fords helpful instances of the values of alertness to metaphorical cues. The notable figure of the dove's flight in the Introduction to The Critique of Pure Reason marries substance and attitude in a fashion pertinent to our present discus- sion. Kant is discussing the misleading 18th century extrapolations from post- Newtonian mathematical triumphs into realms of knowledge dependent on ex- perience. The relevant passage runs: Misled (or encouraged) by such a proof of the power of reason, the demand for the extension of knowledge recognizes no limits. The light dove, cleaving the air in her free flight, and feeling its re- sistance, might imagine that its flight would be still easier in empty space. It was thus that Plato left the world of the senses ... He did not observe that with all his efforts he made no advance-meet- ing no resistance that might, as it were, serve as a support on which he could take a stand. . ... (AS, B9) The metaphorical structure here is of such brilliant integrity that Kant's long</page><page sequence="5">METAPHORICAL THINKING 35 and circumspect argument thereafter is in the nature of an elaboration of the im- plicit content of this figure, for if we recall only the obvious (not the recon- dite) connotations of this role we can see that what Kant's bold metaphor en- tails is tantamount to a new covenant, or a new dispensation. God's first major covenant with men, to Noah after the Flood, was announced by the dove. The typological heightening of this to the level-beyond just consideration-of re- demption is the descent of the dove to the Holy Ghost. This "dove's" abiding presence completes the otherwise struc- turally incomplete guarantee of the In- carnation and Passion which has the systematic defect of being necessar:ly temporal and finite. Very quickly in Christian plastic thinking the dove came -by obvious analogy-to represent the soul as well and, by amalgamation with Neo-Platonic and Gnostic usage, the dove spiralling upwards towards the em- pyrean came to represent the successful return of the exiled soul to its eternal home. Kant's reimagining of the figure creates a disjunction. The dove can rise only to the upper limits of phenomenal experience. A little aerodynamics dis- credits the dove's symbolic pedigree. The metaphor's latent tone is thus one of heroic renunciation, and perhaps a fugi- tive confession of regret. Despite all his personal piety, Kant's philosophical judgment, as it inheres in this metaphor, announces noumenal exclusion. Our new covenant is with our own unaided strength. This reading, of course, is not intended dogmatically. It is a demonstra- tion of a form of metaphorical inference which is possibly valuable to historians. At worst, it may sensitize us to latent or recessive indications in formal texts. If we move from the supremely syste- matic imagination of Kant to a thinker equally endowed with genius but with a wholly different and altogether less com- fortable purchase on existence, Pascal, we can tease out another way to read the inner dictates of metaphorical usage. Pascal's vision was fiercely alert, agitated by contradiction, tense with the fear of system as a threat to spiritual vigilance: "Jesus will be in agony even to the end of the world. We must not sleep during that time" (Pensdes #552). Understand- ably his mortified spirituality found its artistic formal correlative in the discrete communiques from his beleaguered spirit which we know as the Pensdes. They re- flect his insomniac vigil, his spurts of hopes, his ad hoc therapy to his own fears. They are disturbingly human. Though they are obsessively about God in their explicit content, they have the perhaps not unintended emotional effect of dramatizing Pascal himself. This pe- culiar quality he shares with John Donne of the Sermons and the Holy Sonnets, with Tolstoy after his conversion, and with Kierkegaard. All these writers suf- fer acutely from what might be labelled the fear of ontological invisibility. The more they seek to aggrandize God, the more we feel that it is because they fear that His remoteness, His problematic dis- position towards them quite literally threatens their actuality. They prescribe against their saturated egocentricity with such unavailing axioms of prudence as: "When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a common error" (Pensdes #18). But the formulation itself guarantees the continuation of the suffering. The radical metaphor may be variously expressed but it is always the same: "Formulations are Traps"; "Building is Folly"; "Par- ticipation is Error." Under it all is the pernicious teleological fallacy, most suc- cinctly caught in Augustine's compre- hensive metaphor, "Natus est Mortem," that since the "end" of life in the sense of its physical termination is death, its "end" in the sense of its goal (or its sum- mary meaning) is death as well. Once become a captive adherent to this basic metaphor any surcease, any affiliation, any local hope must be rooted out for</page><page sequence="6">36 COLLEGE ENGLISH the "disloyalty" it is. A logically ordered circuit of metaphors is detectable, all fiercely judgmental in quality: "Human Love is Intimacy," "Intimacy is Sur- render," "Surrender is Fusion," "Fusion is Ontological Obliteration," "Ontologi- cal Obliteration is Spiritual Death," "Spiritual Death is the Betrayal of Christ," "Betrayal of Christ is Denial of God," "Denial of God is Chaos," "Chaos is Entropy," "Entropy is Sleep," "Sleep is a Sweet Thing," "A Sweet Thing is Human Love" and then around the circle again, and again. How to escape this terrible situation? Interestingly Pascal, with an almost mathematical severity, re- sorts quite formally to a paradigm in- stance of metaphor-in which the process of formal isolation and replacement of relevant qualities proper to metaphorical construction is literally traced by his reasoning. In #554 in the Pensees, he hears Jesus address him: Compare not thyself with others, but with Me. If thou dost not find Me in those with whom thou comparest thy- self, thou comparest thyself to one who is abominable. If thou findest Me in them, compare thyself to Me. But whom wilt thou compare? Thyself, or Me in thee? If it is thyself, it is one who is abominable. If it is I, Thou comparest Me to Myself. Now I am God in all. This brilliantly specious instance of metaphorical displacement ends with a note of serenity otherwise absent in the Pens"es, "Be not therefore troubled." The procedure leads quite neatly to the exclusion of all that individuates Pascal. Pascal is burnt away; God remains. The final metaphor is, as from Sinai, "Me is Me," hence, since Jesus does not sleep, when the insomniac, arbitrary "I" finally sleeps, the true "I" is not sleeping. If we turn back on the glancing and unstable brilliancies of the whole collection of the Pens7es, we can see that they form constellations of varying radicality around the center of this wish to be sub- sumed into this ground of metaphorical equivalency. The quasi-political thoughts recorded in the Pensies have only a temporizing intention. Their aim is solely to blunt the social world's capacities for interference with this private, spiritual transaction. Many of the thoughts are registered merely to charm distracting fears. Blake's metaphor, "Folly is an end- less maze," summarizes well enough Pas- cal's fearful reading of the sublunary world. Hence, refuse to enter the maze which is endless. To follow the inner movement of Pascal's metaphorical vigi- lance is to restore the original potency of the ancient notion of mortification. If we reveal that "apparent life" is "death," we can discover that "apparent death" is "life." Pascal's Pensdes constitute a regi- men for ontological visibility, they have no larger social or political significance. The humanly constituted world seen through Pascal's fierce obsessive gaze is denuded of legitimate signification, there are only regulative "common errors"; he refuses to make one in the communal reification rituals. But to gain this per- spective he has to put out his human eyes. Joseph Conrad says memorably that, "The serenity of truth and the peace of death can only be secured through a largeness of contempt embrac- ing all the profitable servitudes of life." Pascal's contempt lacked this "largeness," he was too puzzled and fascinated by the "carelessness" of unthinking humanity not to envy them their exemptions from torment. He could neither see what they saw in ordinary existence nor wholly ig- nore the fact of their pleasure in these things. Hence the absence of serenity. Though officially a Roman Catholic and polemically useful to one wing of that faith, Pascal's personal position, as re- vealed by his metaphorical addictions, is radically heretical. Metaphorical habits betray the social compass of the thinker- artist's basic position. These could per- haps be arranged in a table of quo- tients of socio-political commitment. Sir</page><page sequence="7">METAPHORICAL THINKING 37 Thomas More, Kant and Pascal vivify by their radical allegiances variable areas of human endeavour. This is one way of looking at practical faith. Now, I want to take a more formal look at what various forms of metaphori- cal thinking have in common. II The heretic is he who has personal ideas. -Bossuet We can make a sequence of three sepa- rate, aphoristic statements-each in itself a little opaque, but mutually illuminating when conjoined: Nietzsche's, "Error is parent of all vitality"; Vaihinger's "Metaphor is the most expedient form of error"; and Kafka's "All human errors are impatience, a premature breaking off of what is methodical, an apparent fenc- ing off of an apparent thing." This se- quence of statements offers us a new way of considering the truism that "To err is human," for, in one sense, "error" is man's talented interference with the in- herited coherencies of the social and natural order with the aim of making new and useful wholes of these dismem- bered parts. Thus viewed, metaphor is a product of our need to invent lesser, more manageable coherencies for our cultural benefit, as we piece and repiece our shifting experience into a habitable communal vision. Metaphorical activity is thus a way of contradicting what has seemed self-evident, "of what is methodi- cal," in the conventional view. If it is not merely wanton, this imposition of new "errors" in description or categorization through cogent metaphors is as socially useful as it is inevitable given the multi- tude of private perspectives that must be fused to make a common culture. Where metaphorical innovation succeeds it makes initially arbitrary formulations come to seem necessary thereafter to people thinking in that language. What is in Kafka's provocative phrase "an ap- parent fencing off of an apparent thing" comes to be a very real thing to those whose imaginative experience is there- after constructed in its terms. By being attentive to this creative way of using metaphor artistically and anthropologi- cally, we can perhaps tease out some as- sumptions to help bridge the methodo- logical gap between current literary and historical thought. This requires aban- doning "copy" or rhetorical theories of metaphor in favor of one more sensi- tively attuned to the problems confront- ing us when we seek to organize our practical, cultural experience. In this realm-one common to theorists, law- givers and imaginative artists-metaphor functions as a great type of normative device, one which through controlled stipulation, creates and sustains patterns of meaning. Metaphor is confusingly pervasive. Most non-analytical propositions which join an objective predication to a subject by use of the verb "to be" could be fruit- fully considered as metaphor. But, the net must not be thrown too wide, for where all remains metaphorical there is no selective building up of the coral reef of logically unjustified relationships which is the substratum of confident so- cial intercourse. Socially established met- aphoric patterns are as notable for the kinds of similitudes the users ignore, as for the metaphorical stipulations empha- sized. The virtual omnipresence of a harmonizing substratum of cultural met- aphorical habit can be inferred from the disorienting effects of reading a deeply original writer like Franz Kafka. On first reading Kafka, the thoughtful reader feels, before intellectually he can grasp, that Kafka's ominous simplicity and local coherence is induced by a will- ful, neurotic clarity which calls the normal operations of metaphor into ques- tion. This disquieting sense of seeing the familiar world dereified, can be explained if we see it as a personalized equivalent of "cultural shock." Kafka's essential citi- zenship is of another country, one re- cessed far into the time of childhood.</page><page sequence="8">38 COLLEGE ENGLISH Though his German is limpid, and his observation of particulars is undistorted, the emotional idiom is foreign to the occasion. Ancient private obsessions tend to reabsorb all subsequent apparent novelties which Kafka's intimate persona encounters. Thus we come to feel that for K what are objectively "new" ob- jects and "new" events are to be seen as disguised variants of one real or primal thing, they have only contingent reality as slippery replications of the rigid typol- ogy of unexposed private memories. All is definite but meaning is fugitive. We are overwhelmed by a sense of undiag- nosed abnormality, not in discrete per- ceptions, but in the first processing of the receipts of a perceptual apparatus of exceptional refinement. We must turn towards the normal ordering of these things to diagnose the problem. Normal metaphorical activity accords a quotient of reality to the subject being seized and to the compared object through which the subject's newly de- fined quality is apprehended; in Auden's line, "Doom is dark and deeper than any sea dingle" the radical metaphor, "Our fate is a step-walled, narrow valley in the bottom of the sea" requires a quick pendular movement of the imagination to and from the complex content of the simple abstraction, "doom" or "personal fate" and the remote and awesome physi- cal locale imputed as correlative to it. A little knowledge of each term enlarges the force of the two in relation to each other, as the deep, unpeopled valley be- comes claustrophobic when we put an ac- tor there. It had no such quality of itself. Kafka's way is different. Our corpo- rate human need to see a qualified same- ness where the uninitiated mind sees only difference, is opposed by Kafka's imagi- native habits. Each metaphorical predi- cation is valueless in itself, it is merely a disguise. The most telling commentary on this is Kafka's own haunting statement in his little known "Conversation with a Suppliant": I have only such a fugitive awareness of things around me that I always feel they were once real and are now fleeting away. I have a constant longing, to catch a glimpse of things as they may have been before they show themselves to me. He adds something which constitutes a desperate acknowledgement of the ne- cessity for a practical cloture rule to stabilize our imaginative relationships to the unending range of things we wish to speak of, "it's like being seasick on dry land. It's a condition in which you can't remember the real names of things and so in a hurry you fling temporary names at them . . . But you've hardly turned your back on them before you've for- gotten what you called them. A poplar in the fields which you called 'the tower of Babel,' since you either didn't or wouldn't know that it was a poplar, stands wavering anonymously again, and so you have to call it 'Noah in his cups'." What Kafka's mental style excludes is not artistic coherence-his work is op- pressively self-consistent-but the possi- bility of a publicly intelligible or cultur- ally shareable vision. His imagination captivates ours, it doesn't enlarge. It is the social nature of metaphor which his work calls into question. This is crucial, for while metaphors begin usually in the very confined perceptions of very special people, they are of lasting utility only when these "errors" of the private mind are by cultural expropriation preferred to the "correct" views they contradict. Great literature is normally seminal in its power to dramatize the animating con- flicts of its culture in such a way that its metaphorical formulations of these are received thereafter as basic. Kafka can, by a kind of usurpation of the imagina- tion, recruit less gifted fellow sufferers into the prison-world of his own vision, but he can give them no social landscape to occupy in their own person with a license to develop. There is nothing con- stitutive in his artistic warrant.</page><page sequence="9">METAPHORICAL THINKING 39 Literature moves between imagistic and metaphorical extremes in its use of its distinguishing figurative language. Image and metaphor, far from being nearly the same, are functionally and dispositionally almost opposite. Imagism pushed to the ultimate becomes radical expressionism in narrative, radical im- pressionism in forms which are more in- stantaneous, like the lyric and the "mood novel." To practice imagistic writing is to be as passive as possible and thereby to escape the Humean obligation to judge even as one breathes. This technical dis- position carred over into drama or prose narrative has some extremely revealing by-products, but, without the structural sizing of more conventional external standards, it tends to run into the sands of dadaism and other varied forms of artistic solipsism. Imagism presupposes a passive receptivity, and humorless ortho- doxy in its usage produces the tedium, say, of Dorothy Richardson's five vol- ume, stream of consciousness novel, Pointed Roofs. If imagism is the sover- eign resort of anti-intellectual artists, metaphor is not. Metaphor, at its utter- most limits, culminates in overt didacti- cism, and systematic metaphorical dis- course can be reduced to a progressive sequence of mutually qualifying judg- ments. Pure imagism is the ultimate tech- nical mode of a romantic, radically indi- vidualistic era; one enamoured of the flux, yet garrulously fearful of submer- gence within it. More or less bald meta- phor, however, is the favorite mode of a self-consciously communal, rule-making, consolidating era. In such an era men are anxious to inhibit the flux and thereby to stabilize their reading of events. Con- sequently, they use intellect to force a reductive pattern of coherence onto the superfluity of sensations, commitments, and chances with which nature and the social machine might otherwise oppress them. The basic form of imagism may be stated as "This is this, and, then, this is this, and this is this," until the is copula becomes merely a traditional survival or interloper from a syntactical (i.e., a partly analytical) way of thinking and seeing. Imagistic discourse is, more cor- rectly, paratactical. Things are placed edge to edge in an endless polysyndesis, namely, "This and this and this and this and this and this . . " Metaphor, I hardly need to say, does not work like this at all. It rests on the standard formu- lation: "This is that," or "A this is a that." Mature dramatic fictions fuse these two modes into a realized symbolic form which can be rendered as "This is this and that," working presentationally and discursively at once. In such work we are stimulated to see events vividly and dis- cretely at the same time the artist is qualifying and directing our judgments of them. He is intellectually processing the materials we seem to be discovering as we watch. Thus metaphor involves more or less purposive distortion or falsification of an antecedent perception of likeness. The perceived likeness is only partial and can be made apparent. Metaphorical initiative depends on a talent for abstraction or the capacity to adduce likeness and class similarities in the absence of pure in- stances of indenticality. The holistic psychologist, Kurt Gold- stein, working with brain-damaged pa- tients, provides a neat clinical instance of an absence of metaphorical efficiency, involving an incapacity to recognize, understand, or produce metaphor. In his work this failure of the abstracting faculty is physiological, but it can be oc- casioned by other means than direct brain damage: stupidity, excessive zeal, fear, pride, obsession, and cultural repres- sion among them. Goldstein discovered many brain-damaged patients could not name objects like a knife or an umbrella, or identify colors like red, though they could use these words in relation to con- crete situations, where the object was seen as a functioning element in the scene</page><page sequence="10">40 COLLEGE ENGLISH presented to them. They could use the words as specific images but not when the question of membership in a class was at stake. The patients could use the ob- jects correctly as well. They simply couldn't conceive of implicit properties and compare them. These same patients could not understand the simplest meta- phors and lost the thread of any dis- course in which even defunct metaphors lurked. The ability to follow formal metaphorical discourse undoubtedly rests on the sharing of an intact group of previously learned metaphorical abstrac- tions derived from one's cultural situa- tion. Metaphor is an indispensable pedo- gogic and normative device, focussing attention on arbitrarily accentuated fea- tures of larger activities or forms. Designating metaphor as the main re- source of the verbal technology whereby we build up the shareable Weltan- schauung on which cultures rest pushes Edward Sapir's key generalization about language and society one step closer to the creative process. He and Benjamin Whorf sought to show, with fascinating illustration, that Human beings do not live in the objec- tive world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily under- stood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has be- come the medium of expression for their society. It is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that language is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of commu- nication and reflection. The fact of the matter is that the "real world" is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group.... We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because the lan- guage habits of our community predis- pose certain choices of interpretation. There are certain implicit or ground metaphors upon which our experience rests and which in times of psychic vacuity or stress tend almost to think our thoughts for us-exceedingly simple, dra- matic ways of seeing the larger pattern of events which limit our sense of choice, sensitize our attention, color and deter- mine the range of our mood. Leo Spitzer, the late eminent Romance philologist, reminds us, that in spite of Copernicus, we still say "the sun rises" or "sets" and In Neo-Greek the phrase "the sun is setting" is rendered by "the sun is en- throned like a king," in Rumanian by "the sun enters into sainthood." In both cases the splendor and the glory of the natural phenomenon are interpreted in terms of the human-superhuman splen- dor characteristic of Byzantine art. ... Language is not satisfied with denoting factual contents, but forces the speaker to adopt certain metaphysical or religious interpretations of the world which the community may have learned to deny. These obsolete conceptions remain latent in the language: just as Aeneas when all hope was lost carried his father out of burning Troy on his shoulders, so we tend to espouse our forefathers' beliefs and words in any emergency-when we react atavistically. . . .Voltaire has a libertine Swiss colonel pray in the stress of battle: "God, if you exist, save my soul, if I have one!" Behind the Rumanian figure for the sun- set rests the radical, macrocosmic judg- ment, or metaphor, "life is a pligrimage," and, from this matrix derive the meta- phorical formulae: God is an active judge; death is a reward; the soul is a bride. All these equations are to be vis- ualized as ceremonial scenes, and all are readily rewoven into a theological fabric. A conditioned repertoire of metaphors enables us to do public thinking and to derive socially usable responses out of our feelings. The ability to think meta- phorically is the ultimately visualizable equivalent of the dialectical process in the realm of conceptual discourse. How closely the two overlap can be seen from</page><page sequence="11">METAPHORICAL THINKING 41 a deliberately pictorial reading of Plato's Symposium. By enabling us to think with preconditioned fluency this circumstance fosters naive dogmatism. The gravita- tional efficiency of a metaphorical field, thus, has its dangers, for metaphor as it is practiced is what Cassirer calls "a meth- odological hybrid." This is its strength, for thus it fuses different orders of things, but this is also its weakness; born of "fruitful error" it invites conventional error as well. Metaphor is symbol in its instrumental phase employing the basic pattern, "A this is a that": "My love is an unfading rose," "God is a lamb," "Life is a mist of error," "Sin is death," "Hamlet is Prince of Denmark." The cogent simplicity of metaphor conceals its most dangerous fault. The metaphorical examples differ importantly in their inclusiveness. The use of the copula, "is," can easily be confused in the mind with an "equals" mark. It can be understood as an assertion of an expressive partial similarity; it can also be misunderstood as a statement of identity, or, even worse, as a confident assertion of essence. If we adhere to the properly instrumental function of meta- phor we recognize the "is" is proximate and elliptical and hence probably inaccu- rate for anything other than the com- pressed, contextual function it is meant to fulfill. "Sin is death" is a linchpin proposition within an imaginative con- text almost as wide as western culture itself. "Hamlet is Prince of Denmark," on the other hand, is a contingent equa- tion indicating one-half of the most interesting artistically organized dilemma in our cultural heritage. It is a statement at once asserted and tested within the particular group of mutually qualifying verbal facts we call Shakespeare's Hamlet. The conventional affirmation "Caesar is a great man," when analyzed in simi- lar fashion, is seen to be an expressive fiction indicative of parallel qualitative inferences, exactly analogous, though of very different public consequences, to the lover's sweet illusion, "Juliet is a pearl." "Is" in each of these examples measures a different degree of elliptical- ity. Some would even deny metaphorical status to propositions like "Caesar is a great man" on the grounds that it is sim- ply an abstract predication asserting a non-imagistic opinion. This is a costly error, for it lets slip one of the most mo- mentous aspects of metaphor. In some languages, as in Semitic ones, there is no syntactical necessity for the copulative verb in a statement of this kind. One sim- ply speaks appositively: "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark;" "my love's belly, a bushel of grain;" "0 Lord, our dwelling place." One knows he is marking an attribute, indicating a possible relationship or ex- pressing comparative values. No one, as we constantly do in English, is likely to reverse the proposition. No one is likely literally to substitute a house or dwelling place for God, or address lyrics to a bushel of wheat, but this confusion oc- curs frequently in analytic language, as recently with "Eisenhower was a good president." Since the predicated category "good president" is difficult to supply with content, the standard expedient is to move from the puzzling abstraction "good president" to the comforting par- ticular-the kindly, Bavarian peasant's face of Eisenhower. Through this cir- cumstance of reversibility, Eisenhower becomes a concrete symbol of what could not otherwise be defined. What is a good president? Why, "A good presi- dent is Eisenhower." And then, in the face of future uncertainties, we can al- ways cite this definitional instance. This process indicates what it is to "cultify" someone, so that his name ceases to be a proper noun and is transposed into the category of common noun or generic term-thus becoming a cultural symbol. This process unifies the most interesting stratum of poetic statement in Shake- speare's play Julius Caesar. In that play, after his assassination, the energy of Julius Caesar's vital presence passes into</page><page sequence="12">42 COLLEGE ENGLISH the name Caesar and thereby indicts as imposters all who seek the role now ex- propriated by his name. Finally, in the play, the expressive and annihilating tautology "Caesar is Caesar" is confirmed by the dying Cassius and Brutus as their terminal suicidal insight. Metaphor is a two-edged verbal tool and hence is most safely employed in relatively specific imaginative tasks. Meta- phor is best understood as that particular phase of symbolic activity which directs attention, delimits reference, and relates private desire to public necessity. Meta- phor is to the need for codified or nor- malized values, to public ways of seeing and feeling, what laws are to science and general concepts are to discursive think- ing. Metaphor simplifies what would otherwise be too complex to evoke a normative response. This operates from advertising slogan substitutions of some crude reduction of the object for the object itself, such as "scent is sex," ever upward in spirals of increasing sophisti- cation till it reaches to emblematic cul- tural axioms like "King Louis is the Sun," or to the use of qualifying epithets for Homeric heroes who personify the arete of their society. If a man is to act as a symbolic gathering point in a culture he has to restrict the imaginable predications his subjects or followers usually make. This process can be revealingly studied in a dominant metaphor of Western cul- ture, one of incalculable value, though only periodically explicit: "God is an eye," which is the root metaphorical statement of the idea we call Providence. III Alles Vergdngliche ist nur ein Gleichnis. -Goethe, Faust In the Iliad a standardized group of epithets act, like the mutual qualifying images of a poem, to make a poetic sim- plification of each hero. The hero be- comes like a poem, more intelligible, less mutable in seeming, more memorable by virtue of these contrived simplifications of his nature. The epithets place them- selves between us and any interest we might have in a more casual, fuller view of what the hero is or what he experi- ences. We can see vividly in the Homeric poems what is not so visibly true other- wise: a man "means" nothing until we learn how to "read" him. Children often "read" heroes wrongly; witness innumer- able variants on the folk tale of the em- peror's new clothes, since the naive child can't yet "read" the public idiom of con- ditioned blindness. There is a common histrionic tendency in all those ethical systems which aggressively cultivate self virtue, excellence, or honor. The arete of the Homeric hero could not become sub- ject for thought without the rapacious memories of the bards who processed the raw, transitory exploits of a Diomedes or an Ajax into the lasting stuff of formal- ized verbal statement. These poets were delegated to re- present the symbolic actions of men who were already partly symbolic, i.e., al- ready recognizable counters in the ritual- ized game of aristocratic militarism. Inso- far as war is ritualized and episodic, inso- far as it has self-conscious protagonists who discuss their own destiny as later men will speak of their medical symp- toms or their love affairs, the society's life is fabular and narrative. And, if life is an unfolding narrative, it is being looked at and "read." Its readers are the gods. The gods in Homer are imper- fectly attentive and imperfectly admi- rable, but if we say they are not very admirable what we mean is that unlike the providential deity of Judeo-Christian story they are deceivable witnesses. They do not attend full-time to their duty of surveillance. It is no accident that, al- ready in Homer, Athena is superseding other members of the pantheon in im- portance, for one of the easiest ways to characterize Athena is to say she can concentrate. She has few confusing pas- sions. She can attend to her own; her gaze is grey-eyed and steady. Nearly all</page><page sequence="13">METAPHORICAL THINKING 43 the iconographic paraphernalia that comes to be associated with Athena has to do with seeing: mirrors, owl eyes, invisibility etc. She is partly abstracted though still anthropomorphic. The spe- cial epic pathos of the Iliad, and all sensi- tive readers have remarked it, can be distinguished somewhat like this: the gods often do watch man's actions, and their attention converts what would otherwise be mere brutish encounters into moral issues. But, though the wavering attention of these gods bestows an unmistakable im- portance on men's actions, it does not perfectly ennoble them. The Homeric gods have too many interests of their own, and they have too many ulterior vantage points, too many different ways in which their involvement in men's af- fairs can be explained. They are imper- fectly objective witnesses, for they are themselves corrupt in numerous ways. How, then, is man in his moments of great ethical self-expenditure to know they are attentive, and, if attentive, that they can comprehend the beauty, deli- cacy, or courage of his act? The Olym- pian activity of seeing has not as yet incorporated into itself a further meta- phorical sense of "seeing," as the Chris- tian God "sees" into the innermost cran- nies of the soul. Divine viewing of human activities in the Iliad is still essentially an act of physical attention. Furthermore, how are witnesses who haven't the ca- pacity for death really to understand the nature of heroic choice which presup- poses the possible renunciation of every- thing, resting, as it does, on the "incom- possibility" of two or more simulta- neously pursued courses? For the gods who live forever, to choose is not, as it must be for men, to eliminate or negate. Zeus's endless amours are the graphic expression of this fact. The gods' ageless- ness, their energy, their limited number, their imperfectly realized symbolic sig- nificance, suggest that they can combine and recombine in different permutations and thereby achieve many significances. "God is an eye" is not yet abstracted enough in Homer to escape the anthro- pomorphized opportunities and distrac- tions implied by the gods' assigned roles as sentient beings. So, there is a strong compensatory humanistic drive in the Iliad which can be defined as the desire of these heroes to perform before a watching spectator- hood of men as yet unborn, rather than solely before the gods. But, still, the actors in the Iliad, contrary to the Ger- man Romantic dogmas about their ingen- uous simplicity, are very self-conscious, very deliberate performers. They are actors not in a story but in the heroic fable that is their life. They live by being seen, for Olympian and bardic seeing is the guarantor of memory, and this co- gent visual memory, which translates them into intelligible metaphor, estab- lishes their being for themselves and for us. When a society's self-consciousness is excited by its own accomplishments or by its fear of extinction, literature is most vivid, and literary activity com- mands the most vital intelligence. At such times, prophets, seers, vatic poets, and allowed fools who bring an alterna- tive vision of things, as surrogates for the watching deity, are given the best hear- ing. One example can serve for many. The prophet Nathan's confrontation of the erring King David prototypifies ex- plicitly dramatized metaphor, or parable. Parable has been the pedagogic weapon of all great imaginative innovators. David saw Bathsheba, the beautiful wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of his soldiers, bathing on a roof near his palace. He wanted her. To bring off the seduction safely, he shamefully contrived the death of her brave husband in the most callous and ignoble fashion. And the Lord sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him and said. .. There were two men in one city; the</page><page sequence="14">44 COLLEGE ENGLISH one rich and the other poor. The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had brought and nourished up . . . and was unto him a daughter.... And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come unto him. And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, as the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die . . . because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. And Nathan said to David, thou art the man. This is the use of parable in its most direct and pure form. First, it is like a syllogism in which the selected target of the story supplies the missing conclusion only to have a new middle term substi- tuted by the teller once the pattern is clear. The major premise has been stated by the culture, but it has been forgotten. Second, what Nathan does as the agent of a moral, observant deity is to simplify the passionate variety of David's char- acter enough so that David can see what he "is," not how he felt. It is an act of abstraction which culminates appro- priately in the neat metaphorical com- pression of David, the sinful individual, into what David the political person hates, so that "Thou art the man" reads as the radical metaphor, "He is I." Third, the vexed question of what we mean by "fictional identification" with the pro- tagonist or with the social order in a story, or in an historical episode (a trans- action crucial to the arousing of neces- sary imaginative sympathy) is here illu- minated. The hearer or reader identifies not across a broad, multiform human front but across the narrow bridge of controlled metaphorical equivalency. Metaphor defines relevant but denied components in the complex self through affective simplification. Here again meta- phor is seen as a form of directive ab- straction. Not all literary use of metaphor has the urgent clarity of the Nathan parable. Much of the finest literature works not with fully explicit metaphor, but rather with implicit or structural metaphor or through thematic analogues. The pris- matic original figure which is refracted through the work has to be inferred from the group of facts or attitudes visible in the work. Shakespeare, as usual, affords a telling example. Othello is the most highly compressed and tightly organized of Shakespeare's great plays, so nearly everyone repeats. Yet many critics question the relevance of particular sequences, scenes, and sub- elements, as the careful accounts of the Turkish fleet, or the meticulous inspec- tion of the castle fortifications which in- terrupts the climactic action. The func- tion of these elements in the play's larger design can be readily determined by iso- lating the play's basic, or gathering meta- phor, one never directly expressed but constantly ramified. The metaphor itself equates a highly abstract cultural disposi- tion, faith, to a perfectly visualizable concrete structure, a citadel. This con- junction is not arbitrary. It is traditional in Christian emblematic thinking, and moreover, faith is in its own way as con- crete as a citadel, though it is ontologi- cally different. The equation may be read either way, for psychologically understood, one's personal citadel is a very abstract notion. The play's radical, submerged metaphor can be stated: "Faith is a Citadel." Such analysis does not distract from Othello as an im- mensely powerful love story. An other- wise sordid police dossier crime is uni- versalized by the revealed pattern of various modes of undermining faith: sub- verting that particular kind of faith we call love; wrecking another kind we call responsibility; until many smaller and smaller analogues are seen to be sub- sumed imaginatively under this central</page><page sequence="15">METAPHORICAL THINKING 45 imaginative equation, the truth and con- tent of which the play seeks to realize. Othello then is a profound imaginative inquest into the failure of a key cultural metaphor to sustain one noble individual. Othello is movingly, ironically, terrify- ingly wrong, for he failed to see it was Desdemona's faith that was his citadel, not his own poor insecure ramparts. When he says "My life upon her faith," he should rather say "Her life upon mine. She is secure in my care; my citadel is safe for the faithful girl." Othello is a tragedy of damnation, because this error exists objectively in the world of the play, where a God who grasps, with clear-eyed constancy, the difference be- tween true and false faith is the guarantor of the possibility of a valid faith. His "objective" presence as a qualified per- ceiver, a "knowing eye," ultimately es- tablishes our sense of the play's excep- tional solidity. Othello is, at base, a mature, realized metaphoric statement which asserts "This is this and that." We see with a totally sustained irony that Desdemona is a citadel and she is not; Othello is faithful and he is not. One might suppose the metaphor, "God is an eye" outmoded, but it infil- trates the most sophisticated circles. Modern French existentialists-notably Sartre-in their literature of "extreme situations" have worked out some ulti- mately Stoic refinements of this meta- phor. The "Eye of God" becomes in their usage not an expression of wrath, or conscience, or of a social contract be- tween Lord and vassal, but a witness who is a knowing accomplice of the lonely hero by virtue of His qualifications as an ethical connoisseur. This current usage is of Stoic ancestry. For the Stoic, living in isolation in hos- tium terra (in the compromised world of specious values and habitual evil), the essential attribute of Providence (the watching eye) was not its jealous surveil- lance nor its punitive gestures in case of ethical lapse. This is the Hebraic and Puritan acceptance of the metaphor. For the Stoic, "God's eye" guaranteed a qualified audience. Truly heroic acting would be appreciated by a judge suffi- ciently discriminating to invite man's best efforts. This provides an invitation to cosmic as opposed to social histrionics. Stoicism is supremely snobbish, su- premely self-centered, it is always com- posing the scene, appraising and reflect- ing on the latent possibilities of the com- posed role. Seneca, the most self- conscious of the Stoics, can supply our evidence. The initial argument of his treatise De Providentia, written to answer the age-old question "Why, if a Providence rules the world, it still happens that many evils befall good men?," is that the gods, like serious fathers with promising sons, are interested in strengthening the moral fiber of promising men; the weak are not of much interest to them; so they let them play. Therefore, the good have to struggle, because by rising to this test they are made stronger,-and because, implicitly, (and later the Calvinists are to cash this) their being made to struggle is an earnest of their superiority. Seneca, while using this commonplace explana- tion of evident misery and undeserved pain, is too intelligent not to doubt its adequacy. It is easy to imagine a good God arranging it otherwise. Seneca's answer is revealing, "for my part, I do not wonder if sometimes the gods are moved by the desire to behold great men wrestle with some calamity." He supplies an analogy from the great theatrical spec- tacle of the Roman arena, where men are "stirred with pleasure if a youth of steady courage meets an onrushing wild beast. ... And the more honourable the youth who does this, the more pleasur- able the spectacle becomes." But, such pastimes as this analogy affords are too childish for the gods. "A contest worthy of God, is a brave man matched against ill fortune, and doubly so if his also was the challenge (utique si et provocavit)."</page><page sequence="16">46 COLLEGE ENGLISH The suicide of the younger Cato pro- vides apt illustration, "I do not know, I say, what nobler sight the Lord of Heaven could find on earth, should he wish to turn his attention there, than the spectacle of Cato, after his cause had already been shattered more than once, nevertheless standing erect amid the ruins of the commonwealth." Though all the world is Caesar's, Cato's life is his own, and he can win freedom through suicide. Seneca is moved by the imagined spec- tacle, and his language is eager, "I am sure that the gods looked on with ex- ceeding joy (Liquet mihi cum magno spectasse gaudio deos)." Cato failed to kill himself with the first sword thrust and had to rip open his wound to die, because "it was not enough for the im- mortal gods to look but once on Cato. Surely, the gods looked with pleasure upon their pupil as he made his escape by so glorious and memorable an end." Here the metaphor, "God is an eye," has undergone an intense specialization without any alteration of its basic struc- ture. Cato is so eagerly seen from the vantage point of the watching deity, while being so strongly felt from the harassed Seneca's position in Nero's terri- ble court, that he is literally imagined to have been asked for or permitted a sui- cidal encore. The rich metaphorical situ- ation has been literally transposed to the theater. Metaphor, as an abstracting device, gives us a means to distill permanence from our own and others' evanescence. It makes us, as well as things, partly into symbols which, being caught in the warp and woof of society's language network, give us insurance against the time to come as well as stylized, intelligible real- ity in the present. By this means, what we do is understood and it is meaningful. In times like Seneca's and our own, when the social order supplies too few gratify- ing public metaphors to sustain men, private life is made meaningful by postu- lating a bored god who "reads" our set of life gestures to gratify himself. We can deify the most discerning part of our own intelligence and make ourselves an eye so as to observe like James Joyce's or Sartre's heroes our own artful pilgrim- age-every man his own attentive Christ. One does not have to "believe" anything to benefit from a cultural metaphor like "God is an eye." National and period styles within Western culture considerably depend on artistic adaptation of these highly ab- stract, cultural metaphors to local, visu- ally manageable figures suitable to the time. In Samuel Beckett's spectral and static dramatic world God's eye is glau- cous at least, and the blurred conceptual field of Beckett's work is more intelligi- ble if we view it thus. Culturally deter- mining metaphors have twin properties: they are clear and imaginable in them- selves, and they allow for expressive and ironic ramification. They act as a means of self-definition for individuals and groups; they establish useful equations between crucial moral' abstractions and available visual experience; they may be reversed, construed ironically from both ends, and inwardly explored-almost any- thing but discarded. The most profound social creativity consists in the invention and imposition of new, radical meta- phors; it also and more often consists in adapting old metaphors to the current energies of a culture. Even quite private lyric and reflective poets like Emily Dickinson and Wallace Stevens characteristically organize their tautest poems around invisible, recessed metaphors, and these metaphors are in the nature of judgments conditioned by the larger historical circumstances of their epoch and social locale. Obsessed artist-thinkers like Nietzsche and Strind- berg subtly distort standard figures and their artistic perspective is reconditioned by such occurrences. For both of them "Life is a journey" becomes "Life is an ambush baited by pity," and nearly all their qualitative assertions are recast ac-</page><page sequence="17">METAPHORICAL THINKING 47 cordingly. The catalogue of possibilities is endless. Our vaunted contemporary criticism started from rededication to the text with the aim of discovering what is peculiarly there in terms of the unique verbal network of the poem or fiction. This preoccupation with the composi- tional techniques of art has often pro- duced dishearteningly prosaic descrip- tions of surfaces while avoiding more interesting, and harder, questions of art's organizing principles at molecular levels. As a cultural activity, great art is not to be seized by rhetoricians with any of their consecutive methods. The point of original incandescence for a work of art is its first pregnant and often unexpressed metaphor, the rest is second-order elabo- ration. The radical metaphor is the lens which creates the contemporary perspec- tive we otherwise will lack. If historians are obliged to seek witnesses, we need to know how to see with these witnesses so as not to make their testimony into a kind of enfeebled hearsay. At this point in the development of modern analytical skills the ancillary means afforded by matured social sciences, married to the conventionally trained literary critics' often unanchored expertise in rhetorical strategies, can foster a more adequate etiology of metaphorical process.</page></plain_text>
