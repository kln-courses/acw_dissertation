<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE IN THE PANAMA CANAL: A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER OF U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH Alexandra Minna Stern, PhD In 1903, the United States took possession of the Isthmus of Panama with the intention of building a canal, a monumen tal feat that required expertise in both large-scale structural engineering and public health. For the most part, the story of sanitation in the Canal Zone during the era of construc tion (1904-1914) has focused on the medical arm of the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC), established by the fed eral government to oversee the massive task of carving a waterway out of the Central American tropics, and on the activities and personality of William Crawford Gorgas, the army doctor who served as Chief Sanitary Officer.1,2 Yet the Public Health Service (PHS) was integral to American sani tation in Panama. PHS physicians managed quarantine op erations, oversaw the eradication of rats and mosquito lar vae, superintended hospitals, attended patients, and staffed laboratories. Furthermore, in 1915 the PHS put the lessons learned and techniques developed in the Canal Zone on display at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE), mounting an impressive exhibit that was viewed by millions of Americans.3,4 This Public Health Chronicles highlights the forgotten his tory of the PHS in Panama, paying particular attention to Claude Connor Pierce, who was the first sanitary officer sent to the Canal Zone in January 1904, just in time to observe the lowering and replacement of the French flag with the U.S. flag.5 Born in Tennessee in 1878, Pierce received his degree from Chattanooga Medical College and joined the PHS in the lower ranks in 1900 after serving in the Spanish American War. He was sent to Panama in 1904, where he worked his way up from assistant to senior surgeon, first acting as a quarantine officer and then, starting in 1913, as the superintendent of Col?n Hospital.6,7,8 Afterward, Pierce was transferred to San Francisco, the site of the PPIE, to direct sanitary efforts and organize the PHS display. During his journey from the ports of Panama to the San Francisco embarcadero, Pierce worked alongside many PHS physicians, including Henry Rose Carter, who advanced the understand ing of mosquito-borne ailments and strategies for their eradi cation (and was appointed assistant Surgeon General in 1915), and James C. Perry, long-time quarantine officer who penned some of the first U.S. reports on health conditions in the cities of Panama and Col?n. This small yet dedicated group of PHS officers greatly facilitated the construction of the canal. At the same time, they helped to shape the emer gent field of tropical medicine on a strategically located isthmus that straddled an expanding U.S. presence in the Caribbean and Pacific.

SHARING THE BURDEN OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN PANAMA Like France and Britain, the United States was in a mood of colonial expansion at the turn of the nineteenth century, claiming the islands of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philip pines in the Spanish-American War of 1898, and also com manding Hawaii, Guam, and Samoa. In 1903, after Panama seceded from Colombia, the United States added the Canal Zone, an area about 10 miles wide and 50 miles long, to its holdings. Like Guam and Samoa, the Canal Zone was an "unorganized possession," a status that granted the isthmus virtually no political autonomy.2 Indeed, U.S. dominion over the Zone was nearly absolute and extended into the young republic of Panama. One of the most important aspects of isthmian occupa tion was sanitary control, which Gorgas had mastered in Havana, Cuba, from 1900 to 1902, first in response to a typhoid, then a yellow fever, outbreak. This experience illus trated that after winning on the battlefield, the maintenance of political order often entailed a sanitary offensive capable of neutralizing an array of disruptive pathogens.9 This lesson</page><page sequence="2">676 O Public Health Chronicles was perhaps nowhere more applicable than in Panama, where diseases whose etiologies were not fully grasped in the 1880s? above all, yellow fever and malaria?had decimated the French Canal Company and taken the lives of approximately 20,000 able-bodied workers. Fortunately for Gorgas and the ICC, the United States had timing on its side. The previous 20 years had seen the emergence of tropical medicine, a field that combined bacteriology, microscopy, parasitology, and entomology to elucidate the transmission patterns of dis eases prevalent in hot and humid climates, usually via insect and animal vectors.10 Most apposite to the Panama Canal, experiments conducted by European and American scien tists had confirmed the mosquito species responsible for yellow fever and malaria (and in the latter case, microscopi cally identified the pathogenic plasmodium carried in the gut of the Anopheles host). Moreover, these medical men, such as Gorgas and Ronald Ross, the Nobel Prize-winning British physician who performed his laboratory work in India, had devised effective methods of mosquito eradication that re volved around the destruction of larvae and "wrigglers," and the elimination of any source of standing water.1011 Once installed in Panama, the ICC knew that the erec tion of a locks canal across the rocky and mosquito-infested terrain could not proceed without the implementation of a far-reaching and hyper-vigilant brand of sanitation capable of protecting the majority of laborers from deadly scourges.

Public Health Reports / November-December 2005 / Volume 120 Thus, Gorgas and the ICC assumed total control of all sani tary matters in the Canal Zone. To guarantee that the U.S. jurisdiction would encompass Panama's two coastal cities, in early 1904 Panama's president decreed that the ICC was "hereby authorized to assume charge of all that relates to the sanitation and health in the cities of Colon and Panama."12 Concurrently, PHS quarantine officers were instructed to "exercise their authority and to dictate the sanitary mea sures for all ships leaving said ports for the Republic of Panama exactly in the same manner as they are instructed to do for ships bound for the United States."13 These dicta transformed the Canal Zone and environs into a working laboratory where U.S. health officials had an enormous amount of power to study disease and enforce strategies of containment and eradication. PHS officers took advantage of this arrangement and were the first American representatives to gather data on patterns of health and disease in preparation for the start of dredging and con struction. For example, several months before Gorgas had assembled his sanitary corps, Pierce filed a report on Panama City and its surrounding areas. He described the city's shoddy sewage infrastructure of partially exposed underground chan nels and its nonexistent water system; included demographic and vital statistics drawn from municipal records; and de tailed the architecture and capacities of the local hospitals, including the 700-bed Anc?n hospital, which was once the clinical centerpiece of the French Canal Company. Pierce bemoaned the lack of a functional quarantine station and sterilization equipment and stressed the urgency to create a station immediately because "Panama is the gateway from the whole world to the west coast of America, from San Francisco to Valparaiso."14 Several dispatches written by PHS physician James C. Perry followed Pierce's report. Describing Colon's urban districts, Perry evinced dismay with the conditions of the city's poorer neighborhood, which extended over a swampy area: "These habitations are filthy in the extreme, and it is difficult to understand how people can live in such unsani tary surroundings with any semblance of health."15 Like many of his contemporaries, Perry often saw cleanliness and dirt, health and disease as reflections of racial differences in personal and public hygiene, wherein dark-skinned inhabit ants tended to be dirtier and more unkempt than their fairer counterparts. Such prejudices constituted the ugly underside of tropical medicine, which in its initial phases partook of the colonialist belief that it was white man's bur den to lift up, civilize, and sanitize the natives.16 For Perry, this mission involved making Col?n into a "healthy tropical city" through the two-pronged approach of sanitary engi neering and hygienic education.17 In keeping with the com bination of hubris and idealism typical among his medical peers, Perry asserted, "Panama offers a fruitful field for the scientific work of the sanitarian" and foresaw that the PHS and ICC's work would "teach a lesson to the world, by show ing what can be accomplished in pest-ridden localities in the Tropics by modern preventive medicine."18 When Gorgas formed his sanitation team in the summer of 1904, he appointed Perry as Chief Quarantine Officer and Pierce as Quarantine Officer at Crist?bal. They remained in Panama for the duration of construction and were joined by additional PHS physicians who collaborated with the ICC.</page><page sequence="3">Public Health Reports / November-December / Volume 120 For instance, Henry Rose Carter, who determined the ex trinsic incubation period of yellow fever and produced a series of authoritative papers on the epidemiology of and eradication methods for mosquito-borne diseases, served as Director of Hospitals.19,20 About one dozen other PHS physi cians served alongside this trio from 1904 to 1914, many fulfilling temporary rotations at the Col?n, Crist?bal, and Bocas del Toro quarantine stations. For PHS physicians, to serve in the Canal Zone was an exciting opportunity to advance the emergent field of tropi cal medicine and implement effective prophylactic health measures. In addition to quarantine duty, PHS officers pur sued clinical studies in the hospital wards, aided urban and rural sanitation campaigns, and participated in the mos quito brigades that marched through Col?n, Panama City, and along the cantons that snaked through the Canal Zone.21,22 As uniformed officers, PHS officers were treated as equals by their ICC counterparts and could operate in a fairly unhindered fashion and without the frictions among local, state, and federal public health agencies that were common in the continental United States in the early twen tieth century.23 PUTTING THE LESSONS OF PANAMA ON DISPLAY Convened in San Francisco in 1915, the Panama-Pacific In ternational Exposition (PPIE) triumphantly celebrated the opening of the Panama Canal.24 Much of the fanfare fo cused on the U.S. sanitary campaign and acclaimed Gorgas for having tamed the tropics and transformed a pesthole into a paradise. Much in the same way that the PHS assisted Gorgas in Panama, the PHS maintained the health infra structure at the PPIE. From his superintendence at Col?n Hospital, Pierce was sent to San Francisco to serve as the PPIE's Chief Sanitary Officer and institute health proce dures on the fairgrounds. Not surprisingly, he replicated the hyper-vigilant methods of sanitation he had practiced for more than 10 years in Panama. For example, one of Pierce's first undertakings?realized as the PPIE's grandiose halls, pavilions, and domes were being raised?was a comprehen sive medical census of all individuals on the premises ac cording to age, sex, and occupation. In addition, Pierce conducted hookworm and trachoma evaluations and, if needed (as mandated by a recently-passed PHS regulation), smallpox vaccination.25 During the 10-month-long exposition, Pierce and his underlings surveyed the buildings, scrutinized concession stands, hung anti-spitting signs on buildings, and assessed the public bathrooms, all the while searching for vermin, locating pools of standing water, and regularly testing the drinking supply for bacteria. In a typical monthly report, Pierce indicated that he applied borax to fertilized soil to discourage fly breeding; discontinued and oiled water foun tains to destroy mosquito larvae; inspected, in total, 244 concessions and structures; and re-inspected the avenues, stockyards, and the fair's rides and booths more than 600 times?ultimately pinpointing 125 problems that needed fixing.26 When Pierce identified sick individuals, he sent them to the Exposition Hospital, which was run by the PHS and operated as a critical care center and an exhibit. It Public Health Chronicles O 677 boasted four wards, an operating room, anesthetizing room, waiting room, x-ray machine, a laboratory, electric massage machines, urine and blood analysis kits, two spiffy Cadillac ambulances, and close to 15 personnel, including several attending physicians and nurses, technicians, orderlies, and a maid.274 While the PPIE was being built, the Exposition Hospital tended to injured workers, and from the day the first brick was laid to the last day of demolition, more than 7,000 people were treated or hospitalized, sometimes re peatedly, by the PHS.25 The PHS Exposition Hospital also fostered the circulation of modern medical thought at its library, where professionals could peruse a collection of more than 1,000 books or borrow from a stereopticon archive of 8,000 lantern slides, many produced during health cam paigns in the field.25 The PHS's crowning achievement at the PPIE was an impressive set of exhibits, six of which won medals, includ ing one gold medal and one grand prize, from the exposi tion's international jury committee.28 These didactic displays detailed the organization and mission of the PHS, illus trated epidemiological patterns and surveillance techniques, and, recognizing the agency's contribution to tropical medi cine, even featured a habitat of living, breeding mosquitoes. Pierce oversaw all of the PHS exhibits, the largest of which covered 5,250 square feet and aimed to present in a "popu lar and comprehensive way, easily understood by the general public, the latest methods of preventing the common com municable diseases."3 This exhibit highlighted more than a dozen conditions, including typhoid, tuberculosis, rabies, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and syphilis, and especially sought to underscore that insects could be dangerous dis ease carriers. Through negative and positive examples of health prophylaxis, the PHS instructed viewers of the exhibit in the basics of bacteriology and made a hitherto concealed universe of germs visible through magnified drawings of microorganisms and the anthropomorphism of creatures such as the liver fluke and whipworm. The magnified bacilli, larger-than-life insects and helminthes, and placards loaded with mortality and morbidity imparted information about newly identified disease vectors, both common and obscure, and greatly increased the layperson's familiarity with the consolidating field of tropical medicine. REMEMBERING THE PHS IN PANAMA The PHS has not received credit for its medical contribu tions to the building of the canal, whether in the clinic, hospital, laboratory, streets, or the jungle. Undoubtedly, PHS physicians improved the overall health of the canal laborers and tended to those hospitalized. They also gathered epide miological, entomological, and bacteriological knowledge that helped to refine models for disease eradication, par ticularly for future campaigns against mosquito-borne ail ments in Latin America.29,30 Nevertheless, the status of the Panama Canal as a colonial territory meant that PHS offic ers operated under the authority of an occupying power, an arrangement that was at odds with the agency's identity as a national body concerned with foreign health insofar as it included immigrant inspection and quarantine regulations. Furthermore, as practitioners of tropical medicine in a colo nial setting, PHS physicians in Panama helped to perpetuate</page><page sequence="4">678 O Public Health Chronicles Placard: "Insect Carriers of Diseases" from the Public Health Service Exhibit at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.

For it was the minority of white laborers, paid in gold, not the diverse majority of black laborers (frequently hailing from Barbados and Jamaica), paid in silver, who received premier clinical care in the Canal Zone and whose homes benefited from mosquito screens.1 Eventually, the strategies employed to protect gold work ers from tropical diseases were stripped of their explicit racial conceits and implemented in health campaigns across many regions of the world. Subsequent generations of PHS officers would reject the prejudicial values embedded in U.S. public health activities in Panama. Nevertheless, the history of U.S. sanitation in the Panama Canal reveals how significant medical developments can be intertwined with disturbing?and from today's standards, unethical?ap proaches to health care delivery. Precisely because of this uneasy combination, it is important to learn from the PHS experience in Panama, which Americans were already be ginning to do at the PPIE in 1915.
