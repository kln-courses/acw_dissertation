Army Air Mobility Research and Development Laboratory FOR MANY YEARS THE ARMY has been actively engaged in improving aircraft survivability and crashworthiness with the emphasis being on increasing occupant protection. As knowledge of human tolerance to abrupt impacts and aircraft crash dynamics increased, it became evident that improved criteria were required for designing systems that would pro- tect the occupant. Initial investigations of occupant restraint systems for Army aircraft explored the feasibility of improving their installations to reduce the frequency of injuries and fatalities in accidents that were potentially survivable. The design of the restraint system and the strength of the compo- nents (seat belt, shoulder harness, fittings, etc.) were examined and as these studies continued, it became apparent that Army restraint systems in use at the time did not possess sufficient strength to keep an occupant in a seat even though the seat remained essentially intact during the crash. Restraint sys- tems also demonstrated excessive elongations that resulted from the use of improper materials. These two inadequacies ABSTRACT The emphasis that has been placed on occupant safety in the space program and on our nation's highways during the past decade has resulted in the development of concepts and materials which significantly improve the performance char- acteristics of personnel restraint systems. However, the basic design of restraint systems presently used in Army aircraft has not been changed in many years, and the systems in use are not optimized to the practical limits of existing technology. In an effort to rectify this situation, modern restraint system technology was surveyed and a proposed military specifica- tion defining a forward-facing restraint system for use in Army aircraft was formulated. The materials, design con- cepts, and features found desirable for maximizing pro- tection were included in the specification. A subsequent effort oriented towards developing a restraint system meeting the requirements of the specification and testing this system to assure its adequacy and the applica- bility to Army aircraft was conducted. The intent of this effort was to modify and refine the specification as neces- sary to produce definitions of an optimum restraint system that can be fabricated within the present state of the art. Since the specified restraint system consists of many sepa- rate and relatively complex components which would be costly to develop from scratch, the philosophy was estab- lished to maximize usage of existing hardware. Major prob- lems encountered were the modification and production of components meeting the intent of the specification using existing hardware as a base. Items that fell into this category include the lap belt retractor, the double inertia reel, the single-point release buckle, the adjusters, and webbing of sufficiently low elongation. The new restraint system also required more sophisticated and specialized testing procedures to assure adequate performance of the system. The com- pleted effort resulted in a thorough evaluation of restraint system technology relative to the requirements for an air- crew restraint system for Army aircraft. The proposed mili- tary specification was revised as necessary to reflect the state of the art in restraint systems so that it can be used by the Army to purchase restraint systems that meet the Army's current needs. Verification that the requirements of the proposed military specification can be met were demon- strated and the results illustrated that a modern, up-to-date restraint system for Army aircraft can be designed and developed within current restraint system technology. 2284</page><page sequence="2">(low strength and high elongation) contributed significantly to occupant injury and fatalities. Restraint systems that did not provide adequate occupant restraint in all directions also increased the frequency of occupant trauma. Since these restraint systems were designed to meet the requirements of existing specifications, it was apparent that a new specifica- tion defining an improved restraint for Army aviators was needed. In mid 1970 the Army initiated a development program to design, optimize, and test an aircrew restraint system for a forward-facing, non-ejecting crew seat and to prepare a mili- tary specification that would define such a restraint system. The restraint system was to conform to the strength and per- formance criteria of the Crash Survival Design Guide (1)* and was to provide protection for all occupants, from the first to the 99th percentile (by weight) Army aviator, from all as- pects of a 95th percentile crash environment (1) for light fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. To develop a meaningful and practical specification, a thorough analytical and design investigation was performed. Previous and current technologies were reviewed to estab- lish the state of the art in restraint system design and injury prediction techniques. An analytical investigation was per- formed to determine restraint system performance as a func- tion of critical parameters and a trade-off study of restraint system concepts was used to establish the optimum config- uration of the aircrew restraint system to be defined by the proposed specification. Prototype restraint systems were then designed, fabricated, and tested. The results of this effort were then included in a draft military specification that defined a new aircrew restraint system. After the draft specification had been prepared it was re-examined and then used to procure additional restraint systems that were static- ally and dynamically tested in accordance with the quality assurance requirements of the specification. The results of this effort demonstrated that restraint systems meeting the requirements of the draft specification were economically feasible and provided empirical data for the overall evalua- tion of the improved aircrew restraint system and final re- vision of the proposed specification. ANALYTICAL INVESTIGATION OF RESTRAINT SYS- TEM PARAMETERS The analytical investigation of germane restraint system para- meters was accomplished using a computer model of a seated occupant. After consideration of several available two- and three-dimensional computer programs, Program SIMULA (2) was chosen for the analysis. A schematic of the occupant model is presented in Fig. 1 along with a listing of the model's parameters for different size occupants. To evaluate the response of the occupant model and to com- pare the results of different cases in a common reference frame, a performance criterion related to the injury potential was selected. The criterion chosen was the Severity Index ♦Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. which considers injury potential as a function of magnitude and duration of impact acceleration and is defined by the equation: t$ 2.5 SI = / a dt (1) ťo where SI = Severity Index a = acceleration as a function of time (G) t = time (sec) Using Program SIMULA, Severity Indices for the head, chest, and pelvis; the restraint system loads; and dis- placement of the pelvis, shoulders, and head were computed and used to evaluate the effect of different values of the following system variables. 1 . Input Deceleration 2. Occupant Size 3. Input Velocity 4. Webbing Material The principal results of this analysis indicated that: 1 . Increasing the webbing stiffness resulted in lower injury potential. 2. Polyester was a better webbing material than nylon. 3. For a given webbing material, the injury potential generally decreased as the weight of the occupant increased. 4. Little or no slack in the restraint system was preferable. 5. Increasing belt tension beyond the elimination of slack had little effect on the performance of the restraint system. 6. Higher energy input pulses produced higher injury potential. 7. The injury potential is directly proportional to rate of onset of the input deceleration pulse. 8. Energy-absorbing webbing for the shoulder harness re- duced the strap loads, but increased injury potential and oc- cupant displacement. RESTRAINT SYSTEM CONCEPTS To determine an ideal configuration for an aircrew restraint system, nine concepts were examined and a trade-off study was conducted to select an optimum restraint system for Army aircraft. All nine concepts were categorized into three main groups, depending on the design arrangement of the shoulder harness and typical concepts for each of these groups are illustrated in Fig. 2. The addition or deletion of side straps to the lap belt and a change in the tie-down strap de- sign has resulted in nine concepts. In the first group, the inertia reel straps connect directly to a single-point release buckle. It requires two single inertia reels (or a double strap inertia reel) and eliminates the need for shoulder harness adjusters. The principal advantages of this group when compared to the other two groups are simplicity and comfort. Some commercial airlines use this concept in their pilot and co-pilot restraint systems.

The shoulder harness design of the second group incorpor- ates a Y or V type of shoulder harness currently used by crewmen of military aircraft and requires a single inertia reel and two shoulder harness adjusters. This group is character- ized by lower weight, better reliability, and better maintain- ability than the other two groups as well as comfort, good service life, and low cost. Longitudinal and lateral restraint of the upper torso are the main disadvantages. Poor longi- tudinal restraint results from the single inertia reel because for identical crash conditions, the deceleration load on a single inertia reel strap will be twice the load on each strap of a double strap shoulder harness. This will result in a greater upper torso deflection since for the same webbing material, a higher load means higher elongation. The reflected strap approach was used for the third group of restraint system concepts. Restraint systems in this group used two single inertia reels (or a double strap inertia reel) as well as shoulder harness adjusters. The webbing from the inertia reel passes through a roller attached to the shoulder harness collar and is permanently fastened at the top of the seat back on the opposite side. This configuration creates a loop for each inertia reel strap, further reducing the decelera- tion loads transmitted to the reels during a crash and the upper torso deflection. This type of shoulder harness is used at the present time by both the U.S. and British Air Force. The principal advantages of this type of restraint system when compared to the other designs are improved longitudinal and lateral restraint. Its principal disadvantages are increased cost, weight, and complexity. The nine concepts were analyzed in a weighted trade-off study that was used to select the optimum restraint system configuration. Numerical ratings for the evaluation factors listed below were determined for each restraint system con- cept:</page><page sequence="5">2288 R.W.CARRANDW.

Weight These values were then used to calculate a total weighted rating for each restraint system that established the relative ranking of the nine restraint system concepts. The restraint system concept selected as the optimum one for Army air- crewmen is shown in Fig. 3 and consists of a single-point re- lease buckle and tie-down assembly, left- and right-hand lap- belt assemblies including side straps, left- and right-hand lower shoulder harness straps, a shoulder harness collar as- sembly, and two reflected inertia reel straps. The buckle assembly consists of a single-point release buckle connected permanently through a fitting to the tie-down strap assembly. The tie-down strap assembly is a double strap design of fixed length for any seat and cushion design that is attached to the seat pan beneath the cushion by a bolted fitting. Left- and right-hand lap belt assemblies include both a lap belt and a side strap. The lap belts are connected to the seat or air- craft structure through automatic lock and unlock retractors and the side straps are attached to the seat structure through combination adjuster anchors. The lower shoulder harness connects into the bottom of the collar assembly through ad- justers. The collar assembly consists of a pad, in the form of a collar, that fits around the occupant's neck. Roller fittings are attached to the collar near the top of the shoulders and the collar assembly is attached to the seat by means of two reflected straps. Each reflected strap extends forward from the inertia reel and is routed around the roller fitting back to</page><page sequence="6">IMPROVED RESTRAINT FOR U.S. ARMY AIRCREWMEN 2289 the opposite side of the seat back. This strap is attached to the seat through a fitting on the reflected end and through an inertia reel on the other end. The lap belt assemblies, tie- down strap assembly, and lower shoulder strap assemblies are connected at the single-point release buckle. This concept was subsequently formulated into designed hardware and was the aircrew restraint system initially described and defined by a preliminary draft specification. RESTRAINT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT After the draft specification had been prepared, the restraint system design was reevaluated to assure that the design re- quirements were adequate but not overly restrictive, economi- cally feasible, and consistent with state of the art. The re- quirements for each individual component were carefully studied to assure correct and complete criteria had been speci- fied and the test methods were reviewed to make sure that the important characteristics of the system would be tested. Subsequent to these efforts, a restraint system design was developed, fabricated, and tested to demonstrate that actual hardware could be built which would meet all the require- ments of the proposed specification. A detailed study of each component of the proposed air- crew restraint system was accomplished and revealed that the design and/or requirements of the following units should be altered: 1 . Inertia Reel 2. Lap Belt Retractor 3. Lap Belt Assembly 4. Tie-Down Strap INERTIA REEL - The inertia reel originally specified in the draft specification was a dual-spool reel with a single inertia locking mechanism that met the requirements of MIL-R- 8236C, Type MA-6. One of the primary reasons a single dual-spool inertia reel was specified instead of two separate inertia reels was to assure simultaneous locking of both shoulder straps, thereby eliminating the possibility of a second reel failure. This would prevent any violent and potentially injurious rotation of the upper torso that might result from the different locking times of two separate inertia reels. Since it was believed that single shoulder strap restraint would be less desirable than no upper torso restraint, success- ful operation of the restraint system with two separate inertia reels required the individual locking of two separate units, and thus decreased the overall system reliability. The principal disadvantage of a single dual-spool inertia reel stems from the requirements for occupant rotation and lateral movement in the performance of flight operations. This type of movement demands different lengths of webbing to be withdrawn from the individual spools and produces a necessity for independent spools. If the spools are not inde- pendent, then a rotation or a lateral movement of the oc- cupant can cause a backlash in the reel. For example, con- sider the occupant rotating to his right, thus requiring a much longer extension of the left shoulder harness than the right. Because both straps must unwrap equal amounts, ex- cess webbing will be deployed from the right spool which will accumulate and eventually backlash the reel. One possible solution to this problem is to use a differential mechanism between the two spools, such as the one used in the F-l 1 1 inertia reel. The differential permits the desired amount of webbing to be withdrawn from each individual spool, thus eliminating the backlash problem. Although use of the differential solves the backlash problem, it imposes heavy weight and cost penalties on the system. Therefore, the practicality of a single dual-spool inertia reel was examined and the advantages and disadvantages of using two separate reels were investigated. To study the merits of using two inertia reels, an analysis was performed which consisted of observing and evaluating the various loading conditions produced within a mock-up restraint system with one shoulder strap disconnected. This condition simulated the failure of one inertia reel. The re- sults indicated that with the reflected strap arrangement, the failure of a single reel would not result in no upper torso restraint. This can be explained by considering the upper torso restraint configuration. Each reflected strap is attached to the shoulder harness collar through a roller fitting, pro- viding a positive attachment between the seat structure and the collar. Since the shoulder harness collar passes around the occupant's neck and down through the lower shoulder strap to the buckle, a restraining member on the proper side of the neck does result from sufficient movement of the oc- cupant. Although considerable movement of the upper torso is permitted, complete loss of restraint is not possible because (1) the length of webbing which can be removed from the un- locked reel is limited to the amount wrapped on the spool and (2) the load is transferred around the neck to the lap belt buckle by the shoulder harness collar. A clear-cut answer as to which system (two inertia reels or a fual-spool reel) is the most reliable is not presently available because of the lack of information concerning the probability of injury due to the extended movement permitted by the single strap restraint and the concomitant rotation. It is anti- cipated the probability of injury from this type of restraint is less than that resulting from restraint by a lap belt alone but higher than a double strap restraint. Combining these considerations with the probability or successful locking of both inertia reels produces a problem which could not be quantitatively answered at that time; however, it was felt that the probability of injury would not be increased by the use of two inertia reels over the dual-spool reel. Consequently, the specification was rewritten to permit the use of either two separate inertia reels or an adequate single dual-spool inertia reel if one is developed at a reasonable weight and competitive cost. LAP BELT RETRACTOR - One area of the preliminary specification that was felt to be overly restrictive and possibly detrimental to the operation of the restraint system was the lap belt retractor force. The maximum force of 30 pounds was suspected to be too high for aircrewmen comfort during</page><page sequence="7">2290 R. W. CARR AND W. J. NOLAN extended usage. To investigate the possiblity, a simple experi- ment was conducted. A test subject was seated in an office chair, wearing a special lap belt to which weights could be attached. These weights were varied between 15 and 30 pounds and the resulting lap belt pressure was subjectively measured. With the 30-pound weights attached to each side of the lap belt, the pressure was judged to be quite severe. The lap belt force greatly restricted movement of the occu- pant and caused numbness of the leg and pain at the hip after a period of 1 hour. The lap belt weights were then reduced in 5-pound increments until a tolerable lap belt force was found. This occurred when the weight attached to each side of the lap belt was 15 pounds. This lap belt force was found to be tolerable for a period of 3 hours and produced no numb- ness of the leg or pain at the hip joint. Therefore, the pro- posed specification was changed so that the maximum re- tractor force was 15 pounds and the minimum retractor force was 7-1/2 pounds. The preliminary specification also required that the re- tractor must fully retract the lap belt webbing before the locking mechanism is released. The purpose of this require- ment was to be sure that the retractor would lock any length of lap belt webbing once pulling motion of the lap belt had stopped or had been reversed. However, there is a minimum length of lap belt webbing required for even the smallest oc- cupant, and having the lap belt retractor lock at lengths less than the minimum length is not really necessary and detracts from the ease of operation. It is only necessary for the lap belt retractor to lock for webbing lengths greater than the minimum or unlock length. It was recommended that the unlock length be the shortest length of lap belt required to span the unoccupied seat cushion with the buckle located on the cushion centerline. LAP BELT ASSEMBLY - A study of the lap belt assembly using a restraint system mock-up indicated that the useful- ness of a thigh or side strap included in the proposed aircrew restraint system was questionable. The thigh strap produced a problem with respect to freedom of movement for the occupant. Since the seat pan is most helicopters is located closer to the floor than the distance between the occupant's knee and heel, retraction of the legs towards the seat re- quires that the thigh lift up away from the forward part of the seat pan. If the side straps are adjusted with the legs extended and feet on the rudder pedals, this movement of the legs is impossible because of the vertical restriction pro- vided by the tight side straps. To permit freedom of move- ment, the straps would have to be adjusted with the heels withdrawn to the rearmost position. This results in consid- erable slack in the side straps when the feet are placed back on the rudder pedals, thus reducing the restraint capability when needed. The side straps also required an adjuster/ anchor and were sewn to the lap belt webbing at the buckle fitting, thus complicating the system. These adjusters re- quire that the occupant adjust both side straps in addition to the lower shoulder straps when adjusting the restraint harness. This meant that, even with inclusion of the retrac- tors on the lap belt, the number of adjustments required was still equal to existing systems and the reduction in system complexity had not therefore been achieved. The side straps also reduce the amount of lap belt webbing which can be withdrawn from the retractors, subtracting from the effec- tiveness of these components. Improvement of lateral restraint is seriously impaired by the necessity for slack in the side straps. The straps are located as far rearward as possible to minimize interference with leg movement which places them very near the hip joint. Therefore, a small amount of slack seriously degrades the ability of the strap to limit lateral leg motion because the strap contact point with the leg is close to its pivot point (hip joint). Lateral movement of the occupant would un- doubtedly be reduced somewhat by the side straps; how- ever, the improved resistance to submarining due to a side strap on the sides would be minimal because of the slack in the webbing. Another aspect of this lateral restraint problem is that most Army crew seats today have some sort of side panel on the seat buckets, thus providing some lateral re- straint. Since these panels will provide restraint prior to significant loading of the side strap, it was thought that per- haps the function of lateral leg restraint should be better as- signed to the seat design. Therefore, the side straps and the anchors were deleted from the aircrew restraint system. TIE-DOWN STRAP - The original tie-down strap design was configured to provide separation of the two straps that make up the assembly. The objective of this design was to permit an opening between the two tie-down straps to eliminate anxiety of crewmen concerned with groin injury resulting from impact loading against a centrally located strap. The twist in the separate strap approach was to provide a flat contact surface for the inside of the thigh, thereby producing improved lateral restraint. A closer examination of this design revealed that the two straps could produce a load acting to hold the occupant's legs too far apart and cause fatigue. The solution to this potential problem was to reduce the spread between the two straps. Since reducing the spread between the two straps eliminated the separation, the psychological advantage of the double strap was also eliminated. This produced two competitive concepts which were reviewed prior to final se- lection. The first was to simply reduce the width of the tie- down fitting on the seat pan, thus moving the webbing closer together and maintaining the twist which would produce flat webbing contact with the inside of the thighs. The second was to use a single piece of webbing (probably lapped over and stitched to form a double thickness) that would attach at the lower end to an anchor fitting. This approach was the simplest of the two concepts and was the one recom- mended for use for the aircrew restraint system. Tests conducted with occupants ranging from the 50th to the 99th percentile, using a mock-up restraint system, indi- cated that a single length tie-down strap would be adequate. It was determined that a single length tie-down strap from the center point of the buckle to the compressed seat cushion surface of 8 inches was equally comfortable for all occupant sizes. The reason for this is that as the thighs of the larger</page><page sequence="8">IMPROVED RESTRAINT FOR U.S. ARMY AIRCREWMEN 229 1 occupant become thicker and raise the buckle, his torso also becomes thicker, causing the buckle to move forward in an arc about its tie-down point. As the occupant becomes smaller, his thighs become thinner, as does his body, per- mitting the tie-down strap and buckle to rotate toward the seat back and seat pan, again around a radius of the strap length. It was concluded, therefore, that adjustment of the tie-down strap is not required which was in agreement with the proposed specification. RESTRAINT SYSTEM DESIGN As a result of the analyses of the proposed specification, the configuration of the aircrew restraint system was slightly changed, and, as now defined by the proposed specification, consists of one dual-spool inertia reel, or two separate inertia reels with two reflected straps, a shoulder harnesscollar assem- bly, a lap belt assembly including retractors, and a buckle assembly. The restraint system is designed to mount on a forward-facing crew seat as illustrated in Fig. 4. The buckle assembly consists of a single-point release buckle perman- ently attached to the tie-down strap. The tie-down strap consists of a fixed length strap for any specific seat and cushion design and an anchor fitting that connects the strap to the seat pan beneath the seat cushion. Left-and right- hand lap belts connect at the single-point release buckle and are attached to the seat or aircraft structure through auto- matic lock-unlock retractors. The shoulder harness collar assembly consists of a pad in the form of a collar, fitting around the crewman's neck, over which the shoulder harness straps are routed. The lower shoulder straps connect into the bottom of the collar assembly through adjusters. The reflected straps pass through the roller fittings at the top of the collar. Each reflected strap is extended forward from an inertia reel, looped through the roller fitting, and is then directed rearward to the opposite side of the seat back. These straps are attached to the seat through an anchor fit- ting on the reflected end and through an inertia reel at the ātTIA :tor ?

Aircrew restraint systems designed to meet the requirements of the proposed specification were manufactured by Pacific Scientific Company (PSCo), and a typical one is shown in Fig. 5. It consists of four major components. 1. Inertia Reel Assembly (Items A, B, and C). 2. Shoulder Harness Collar Assembly (Items D, E, F, and G). 3. Lap Belt Assembly (Items H and I). 4. Buckle Assembly (Items J, K, and L). The total weight for the restraint system is 8.50 pounds and the distribution of this weight among the restraint system's assemblies is given in Table 1 . A complete description of each of the components of the aircrew restraint system is given in the following paragraphs with the letter designations mentioned in these descriptions referring to the items shown in Fig. 5. The webbing being used for the aircrew restraint systems is a special low-elonga- tion polyester webbing supplied by Murdock Webbing Com- pany. Three webbing sizes are used and the physical proper- ties for each are described in Table 2. The load-elongation curves for these webbing sizes are shown in Fig. 6. INERTIA REEL ASSEMBLY - The inertia reel assembly consists of two inertia reels (MIL-R-8236 - Type MA6, ex- cept for modifications) mounted on a common base (Item A) and having a common control cable and lever. Each inertia reel has a reflected strap (Item B) attached to its spool with the other end terminated with an anchor fitting (Item C). The mounting base is designed for horizontal installation and includes two integral strap guides for directing the horizontal exit of the straps and for resisting strap side loads. The con- trol cable attaches to a common lock lever located between the two inertia reels and the control lever is designed to mount on the left side of the seat pan. The control lever is used to put the inertia reel's locking mechanism in a manual lock or automatic lock mode and to reset the locking mech- anism after the reel has automatically locked. The total strap extension of each inertia reel is 32 inches which, be- cause of the reflected strap arrangement, permits 18 inches of upper torso movement for a 95th percentile (by stature) crewman. Because there are two reel return springs, the ten- sion force in each reflected strap is 2 pounds minimum and 5 pounds maximum instead of the 2- to 9-pound tension force currently specified for a Type MA6 inertia reel. The reflected strap (Item B) is made fropi the 1.75-inch-wide low- elongation polyester webbing. The reflected strap anchor (Item C) is a small fitting that provides a slot for the reflected strap's webbing and a clevis for attaching the strap to the seat structure. The material used in the reflected strap anchor is 4130 steel, heat treated to 180 ksi minimum strength. SHOULDER HARNESS COLLAR ASSEMBLY - The shoul- der harness collar assembly consists of a vinyl collar (Item D) that supports the roller fittings (Item E) and adjusters (Item</page><page sequence="10">IMPROVED RESTRAINT FOR U.S. ARMY AIRCREWMEN 2293 Table 1 - Restraint System Weight Weight Restraint System Component lb Inertia Reel Assembly* 3.59 Shoulder Harness Collar Assembly 1.54 Lap Belt Assembly 2.25 Buckle Assembly 1.12 Complete Restraint System 8.50 ♦includes mounting bracket and con- trol cable. 8.5% @ .4,000 lbs ' 2-1/4 X .043 thick 5,000 T 1 1 ļ J 4,000 10.3% @ 4,000 lbs 1 / / 1-3/4 Z .048 thick g 3,000 -J- / U - ~~ 8.4% 0 2,500 lbs a 2,000 ~~ 1-1/4 wide X .043 thick I 1,000 0 1 1 1 1 0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 ELONGATION - PCT Fig. 6 - Webbing load- elongation curves Table 2 - Webbing Properties Shoulder Tie-Down Harness Strap Straps Lap Belt Width (in.) 1.25 1.75 2.25 Thickness (in.) .043 .047 .043 Breaking Strength (lb) 4366 6740 7620 Elongation (percent) 8.2 10.0 7.5 Elongation Load (lb) 2500 4000 4000</page><page sequence="11">2294 R.

The lower shoulder straps (Item G) included in the assembly are threaded through the adjusters at the lower end of the collar, and the reflected straps pass through the roller fittings at the upper end. The collar pad (Item D) is a sewn assembly of Ensolite foam with a vinyl cover and Nomex backing. A length of the 1.75- inch-wide low-elongation polyester webbing was sewn inside the collar to provide a strong load path between the roller fittings and the adjusters located on the opposite side of the collar. However, this length of webbing was subsequently deleted from the design because it would not conform to the collar's pattern and consequently created wrinkling in the neck area of the collar that might have become extremely irritating to the occupant. Analysis and subsequent testing indicated that this design change had no deleterious effects on system performance. The roller fitting (Item E) provides a low friction method of connecting the reflected strap to the lower shoulder strap while allowing easy withdrawal of the reflected strap from the inertia reel during movement of the occupant's upper torso. The roller fitting is connected to the adjuster through an 8-inch length of the 1.75-inch-wide low-elongation web- bing that is overlapped and stitched to the pad, thereby at- taching the roller fitting and adjuster to the collar. The web- bing loop that attaches the roller fitting is stitched close to its frame. One inch away from the roller fitting, the remain- ing webbing is sewn to the collar pad by a long boxed "W-W" stitch pattern. The 1-inch length of free webbing provides a flexible joint that allows the roller fitting to align itself as the angle in the reflected strap changes. The adjuster (Item F) permits the lower shoulder straps to be adjusted so that the fit of the shoulder harness collar matches the occupant. The shoulder strap is lengthened by pulling a lift tab that rotates the locking cam away from the webbing, and then pulling the webbing, through the adjuster. The strap length is shortened by simply pulling down on the free end of the shoulder strap. The lower shoulder strap (Item G) serves as the load-carry- ing member between the adjuster and the single-point release buckle and it consists of an 18-inch length of 1.75-inch-wide low-elongation polyester webbing. The free end of the web- bing is threaded through the adjuster and a buckle fitting is attached to the other end. LAP BELT ASSEMBLY - The lap belt assembly consists of 2 lap belts (Item H) and 2 retractors (Item I). The lap belts are 2. 25 -inch-wide low-elongation polyester webbing, with a metal tab for attaching the webbing to the retractor spool clamped on one end, and a buckle fitting that inter- faces with the locking mechanism of the buckle stitched to the other end. The retractor is an automatic, lock-unlock type in which the webbing can be freely extended against a spring load to its full length. However, a motion stoppage locks and reel, and additional movement is only possible in a belt-tightening direction. Release of the locking mechanism is achieved by allowing the retractor to retract the lap belt webbing to the unlocked length of 1 1 .5 inches. The re- tractors provide a means for storing the lap belts as well as making their adjustment automatic. A movable guide moun- ted to the retractor's housing aligns the webbing on the spool. The retraction force generated by the retractor is between 7-1/2 pounds and 15 pounds. The minimum retraction force (7-1/2 pounds) is measured with the lap belt attached to the buckle, without an occupant in the seat, while the maximum force (15 pounds) is measured with the lap belt fully with- drawn. BUCKLE ASSEMBLY - The buckle assembly provides the connection and release provisions for all of the restraint system's straps, except for the tie-down strap which is per- manently attached to the buckle. The buckle assembly in- cludes a single-point, rotary release buckle with a pad, a tie- down strap, and a tie-down strap anchor. The single-point release buckle (Item J) connects the 2 lower shoulder straps and the 2 lap belts to the tie-down strap that is permanently attached to the buckle. The buckle has a handle on its face, containing 4 symmetrically placed vanes which can be rotated in either direction to release the fittings. Positive ejection springs are incorporated within the buckle to ensure that fittings not fully withdrawn from the buckle during handle rotation do not become reengaged when the handle is released. A vinyl covered Ensolite pad, with Nomex backing that distributes and cushions the buckle load and increases comfort during normal usage, is attached to the back of the buckle. The tie-down strap (Item K) consists of 1.25-inch-wide low- elongation polyester webbing that is permanently attached to the single-point release buckle on one end and to the tie- down strap anchor on the other. The tie-down strap anchor connects the tie-down strap to the seat. It has a slot for the webbing and two clearance holes for .25-inch diameter bolts. The anchor has a 60-degree bend to properly orient the strap and is fabricated out of .125 -inch- thick 4130 steel sheet, heat treated to 180 ksi minimum strength. STATIC TESTS The aircrew restraint systems manufactured to comply with the draft specification were statically tested to verify their capability of meeting part of the quality assurance provisions of the specification. The tests were conducted to show that effective restraint could be provided during a 95th percen- tile survivable accident (1) and the normal operating charac- teristics of the restraint system met or surpassed the specifica- tion's requirements. The test procedures were established to statically test components and subassemblies of delivered re- straint systems on universal testing machines and special pur- pose test fixtures. With the exception of the webbing tests, no special pieces of restraint hardware were required for any of the tests. A series of 10 static tests were conducted that can generally be described as either strength tests or opera- tional tests. The strength tests were conducted on: 1. Webbing 2.

Buckle to ensure that each of these components would operate properly over the expected life of the restraint system and, in the case of a buckle, after being subjected to simulated crash loads. All of the static tests were successfully completed with a minimum of hardware modifications required and a summary of the strength tests is presented in Table 3. The results of the strength tests demonstrated that the failure loads of all components exceeded their respective design strengths; and although elongations recorded during these tests were sligh- tly higher than expected, they were within an acceptable tol- erance region. DYNAMIC TESTS Two dynamic tests of the aircrew restraint system were con- ducted to verify that it could adequately restrain a 95th per- centile occupant (by weight) during two impact environments that are representative of a 95th percentile survivable aircraft crash (1). One test was a vertical impact conducted on Dy- namic Science's drop tower and the other test was a horizon- Table 4 - Dynamic Test Requirements TEST CONDITIONS AND SEAT ORIENTATION TEST 1 : TEST 2 : DOWNWARD, FORWARD, AND FORWARD AND LATERAL LOADS LATERAL LOADS DUMMY INERTIA ^ ' x ^ ~Y ; 1 TEST PULSE REQUIRED* 48G ^ CHANGE IN CHANGE IN / ' VELOCITY = V' VELOCITY = / ' 50 FPS / ' 50 FPS - ri ["* 0 .065 SEC -ri h - 0.103 SEC * THE RISE TIME FOR THE PEAK G PEAK G -w TRIANGULAR PULSES MAY / ' VARY BETWEEN THE TWO / ' VALUES ILLUSTRATED Z I ' (T = TIME) : - 0.4 T 0.8 T~H I r£ ► J ►]</page><page sequence="14">IMPROVED RESTRAINT FOR U.S. ARMY AIRCREWMEN 2297 Fig. 7 - Vertical impact test configurations Fig. 8 - Horizontal impact test configurations tal impact conducted on Dynamic Science's horizontal test sled. Both tests used a 95th percentile anthropomorphic dummy equipped with a helmet, body armor, and vest type survival kit as the occupant. The dummy was restrained in a fixture type seat (rigid) with the test restraint system. Accel- erometers and webbing load cells were used to measure re- straint system loads and the acceleration response of various dummy segments, seat, and test input. Prior to initiating either test, the dummy was inspected to be sure it was in good operating condition, and its joints were adjusted to provide a 1G resistance to the movement of var- ious limbs. Triaxial accelerometer mounts were placed in the head, chest, and pelvic area of the dummy and also on the seat pan and seat base, to measure the accelerations in three orthagonal directions. The weight of the dummy was then adjusted to 212 pounds to represent a 95th percentile Army pilot (3). There was also a single accelerometer mounted to the drop cage and sled to measure the input pulse. Webbing load cells were placed on each of the restraint system mem- bers close to their anchor points to measure the load time history imposed on each element of the restraint system. The restraint system to be tested was mounted on a rigid test seat and connected with the dummy in the seat. All slack was eliminated from the restraint system; the retractors were locked; and the inertia reel was set in the automatic lock position. The test environments specified for the two dynamic tests are shown in Table 4. For the vertical impact test the seat containing the restrained dummy was mounted on a base that simulated the seat being at a 30-degree roll relative to the in- put deceleration vector. The desired velocity change was 50 feet per second with a peak deceleration of 48G and a time duration of .065 second. For the horizontal impact test, the seat containing the restrained dummy was mounted on a hor- izontal test sled at 0 degrees pitch and roll and a 30- degree yaw relative to the input deceleration vector. The desired change in velocity for this test was 50 feet per second with a peak deceleration of 30G over a time duration of .103 sec- onds. Both deceleration wave forms were configured tri- angular in shape as shown in Table 4.</page><page sequence="15">2298 R. W. CARR AND W. J.

The configurations of the dummy and restraint system both before and after the vertical impact are shown in Fig. 7, while before and after photos of the horizontal impact are shown in Fig. 8. During each of the dynamic tests, the restraint sys- tem performed quite satisfactorily. There were no component failures and from the final position of the dummy, it was apparent that the restraint system performed its primary function of permitting minimal body displacements while keeping the occupant in the seat. Deceleration data mea- sured during the horizontal and vertical impact are summar- ized in Table 5, while a summary of the restraint loads mea- sured during each test is presented in Table 6. The peak de- celerations recorded during each test were slightly below the desired level, however, the deceleration waveform and the velocity changes were representative of conditions which exist in potentially survivable Army aircraft accidents de- scribed as extremely severe. Thus it was considered that the test results were within acceptable limits and that they satis- fied program objectives. CONCLUSIONS This paper has described the evolution of a forward-facing aircrew restraint system that challenged the practical limits of current technology. The restraint system successfully met all test requirements although static test requirements were the most stringent ever attempted, and dynamic test condi- tions were equally demanding. Such criteria are necessary, however, if occupant protection is to be provided throughout the survivable accident environment. It is believed that in- juries and fatalities can be significantly reduced in potenti- ally survivable accidents involving Army aircraft of the fu- ture, if the aircraft are equipped with restraint systems pos- sessing the characteristics and capabilities of the system dis- cussed herein.</page><page sequence="16">IMPROVED RESTRAINT FOR U.S. ARMY AIRCREWMEN ¿299 Table 6 - Summary of Restraint System Loads Sled Test Drop Tower Test Peak Peak T j „ , , Load Time Load Time Load T j Cell „ Location lb msec lb msec Left Lap Belt 3175 80 810 87 Right Lap Belt 2240 77 1850 67 Left Shoulder Strap 168 68 110 71 Right Shoulder Strap 1730 89 1785 67 Tie-Down Strap * 1030 191 Reflected Strap - Left Anchor * 863 89 Reflected Strap - Left Reel 376 70 193 59 Reflected Strap - Right Anchor 307 69 166 57 Reflected Strap - Right Reel 1346 93 826 92 ♦Faulty data channel.</page></plain_text>
