THE CONNEXION OF GREEK AND ROMAN ART WITH THE TEACHING OF THE CLASSICS. By Sidney Colvin. Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge. Lecture II. In the last lecture I tried to establish the point that the study of ancient art and archaeology is, or ought to be, an essential part of classical educa- tion properly so called, and that although our own country is proud and justly proud of her classical scholars in philology and other branches of classical scholarship, yet she has not adequately carried on that branch of scholarship which consists in the study, comparison, and explanation of ancient monuments, side by side with that branch which consists of the study and comparison and explana- tion of ancient texts. The two important points to which my last lecture was directed were these: first, that the study of the remains of ancient art and archaeology, the remains of practical handiwork, gave life to the study of literature, and continually illustrated it and brought home with new force the beautiful stories of the ancient writers ; and, secondly, how, independently of literature, and as a separate study, it cultivated valuable faculties, and required very careful and exact special qualities of its own. As an example, to illustrate both of these points, we chose two particular works; in literature, a very beautiful fragment of early religious Greek poetry, the Homeric hymn to Dionysus, and, as a work of art, a frieze very familiar to students of these things, the frieze on the Uhoragic monument of Lysicrates at Athens, which illustrates, in the way which sculpture thought proper to illustrate, the same subject. And we saw how Greek sculp- ture, like all true art, was not the literal illustration of poetry, but how it took the same theme and worked it out in a way of its own, and according to its own laws. In pursuance of our subject, I mean to-day to try and bring home to you how the creations of Greek and Roman art are co-extensive with all provinces of the ancient life and mind. There is no phase of existence in Greece, or in the civilisa- tion which Rome borrowed from Greece, which this study does not illustrate and illuminate; nothing which the ancient Greek, or, following him, the ancient Roman, did, or thought, or suffered, or desired, which has not found an em- bodiment in art - in the practical works of men's hands - as well as in the written records of their literature. That is only another way of saying what we said at starting, viz., that the essential key to the whole of the Greek genius is that which is known by the ugly word anthropomorphism, that spirit which considered all things alike- whether the external aspects of the world, or the forces of destiny, or those of the human spirit - under human lineaments, conceiving of everything that it is possible to conceive of at all in the like- ness of, a human being. That being the key to and essential character of the ancient genius, it naturally follows that those embodiments in the human form were so many conceptions of the mind, standing waiting ready to the hand, to be embodied in art. What we are considering to-day is the range and extent of the conceptions that are thus represented, personified - incarnated one may say, for they became as living, real human beings under the creative touch of ancient art - in sculp- ture, painting, and their subordinate arts. We are not to-day considering the art which is not imita- tive, which does not embody conceptions of the mind in definite human shape, and therefore architecture, for the present, we pass over. The study of ancient architecture, and of the way in which the genius of the Greeks showed itself in the proportions and in the plan of their buildings, especially in their temples - for the whole of the Greek architecture was concentrated on the temple - is one of the most interesting studies possible, and one which reveals to us the Greek mind in its most characteristic way, but does not for the present concern us. Coming, then, to a short survey of the range of these subjects to which the Greek imagination, and, presently, Greek art, gave human lineaments, we shall speak both of those representative works of art which we know to have existed, from the fame they had, from descriptions and accounts handed down to us in books, and also of those, unhappily a much smaller number, which still remain. The greater part of those which we know from books have perished long ago; have been trailed off to Rome in the days of the Roman conquest, and have perished there, or have been rifled where they stood by subsequent barbarians. Of course, in so vast a range of subjects as this, I cannot attempt to illustrate what I am saying with any completeness ; but I have a few diagrams, which I have brought to-day and placed here, to illustrate one or two particular points which will arise in the course of our study. The investigation of these types and creations of ancient art is an investigation of two kinds. First, it inquires what creation - the work of art - represents ; and next, how each particular type begins and grows, how it starts up in early times, and how we can follow it in the remains that have come down to us, growing, developing gradually from rude, primitive, archaic forms, down to the times of the highest Greek civilisation, when the embodiment is adequate and perfect ; and again, when civilisation passes beyond its highest and begins to descend again, how the work of art also begins to go down, and how the consummate form passes into the over-ripe, and so into degeneracy and deterioration. That historical progress will not at all enter into our to-day's i study. Our point is to see how the vorteil of</page><page sequence="2">994 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OP ARTS, October 12, 1877, ancient handicraft and things produced in painting, : sculpture, and a thousand subordinate ways cover the whole range of the ancient life and the ancient mind. The embodiments which present themselves first to our consideration are those of the twelve great Olympian gods of Greece, gods whose origin and history it is in many cases hard to disentangle, but who by the time Greece was Greece, and Greek civilisation was at all developed, divided amongst them the whole empire of the world in the Greek imagination. You are aware how in these concep- tions physical and moral powers are continually intermixed, how originally the sole idea embodied in any god was the physical idea, and how by degrees moral, intellectual, and political ideas became associated with them. And you remember, no doubt, who the twelve great Olympian gods of Greece were. First, the sovereign father of all, Zeus, the god in whom it is probable that originally the physical sky was personified. He holds in one hand the thunderbolt, the symbol of the sudden, destructive, astonishing, overwhelming powers of the sky, and his familiar attendant is an eagle, the eagle of course being in like manner a symbol of things that swoop down suddenly upon the earth from above. Zeus then, who came in the historic times of Greece to be the central father of all the gods, was originally, we suppose, a personification of certain particular powers of the sky. Next associated with him com es the wife of Zeus, Hera. Hera is the goddess of wedded womanhood, she is the sister and wife of Zeus, the deity who assists women in labour, the goddess of birth, the goddess of things especially belonging to women, and belonging to women especially in the relation of lawful married life. Then, own brother to Zeus, co-equal with him, but a divinity almost purely physical, is Poseidon, the god of the sea. In him the powers of the ocean are incarnate, and, naturally, being a representation favourable to art, he suggests his own types and his own accompaniments. Then, keeping still in the order of genealogy, we have, co-equal in age with these, Demeter. The name of the goddess Demeter, shows that her original signification was purely symbolical. Her name means 4 'mother earth. But presently there passed into the conception of this goddess all kinds of further moral and intellectual meanings - mother earth becomes the place from which life springs up and into which life goes down, and so Demeter becomes the goddess of the dead, and the goddess of death, in the sense in which the earth is the place into which all things go down and are lost. In this double sense she remains one of the great powers of the Greeks. Then we come to the younger generation, to the children of Zeus. There is Athene, another goddess of the air, a goddess of light and bright- ness and of the luminous powers of the air. Into association with these physical properties there presently came ideas of intellectual light, of all human art and ingenuity and invention. The list is familiar to many of you, and there is no time to go through it all, of these twelve sovereign powers who divided between them, for the Greek, the empire of the world. They all, of course, had their temples, more or less famous, and their temple precincts, and each temple and each precinct had its images, and these were found all over Greece» and in every region of Greece. In the beginning, Greek sculpture was essentially subordinate to Greek religion, and therefore had its home in the Greek temple. Sculpture arose from the desire to adorn, with the best perfection possible, the images of the gods. Presently, it developed itself, from thus first endeavouring to make the image of the god worthy of adoration, into other uses ; there came to be three classes of sculpture all concentrated about with the temple. First, there was the god himself, the temple image properly so called. That was originally, in the early times of Greek art, a very rough, rude, wooden image, and retained a peculiar sanctity in connection with its original primitive character. Art was unwilling to change it ; and even after the subordinate parts of temple sculpture had acquired something like freedom, the old sacred image re- mained the old sacred image still - a thing rudely cut out of wood, but decked with rich vestments and draperies. But in the course of time the sanctity especially attaching to these rude wooden primitive images passed away, and we find, as Greek art comes to maturity, that it produces generally for these central images of the temple things the most beautiful, the most ripe and mature, that it knows how to produce. Then, besides the central image of the god - the object of worship in the temple - each temple and temple precinct had a vast number of dedicatory statues of its proper god - statues paid for and set up, that is to say, by private or public worshippers. Private persons or states desiring to propitiate the god in honour of some special occasion, would set up a pedestal, either within or without the temple, with a statue of the god under some special attribute, in thanksgiving for some particular protection or in propitiation of some particular evil. Therefore, following those most sacred statues, the special images set up in the temple for worship, you have the other class of statues, the dedicatory statues, set up not specially for worship, but simply in dedication to the gods either for thankoifering ov for propitiation. The third order of sculpture connected with the temple is that which is purely decorative, which springs from the impulse of art and the need of ornament and beauty alone. The principal parts of the temple which were adorned with sculpture for adornment's sake, were the frieze and the pedi- ments. These enrichments were dictated, indeed, so far as concerned their subject, by the religion of the temple, and celebrated this or that deed or manifestation of the temple's god. Let us make a hasty survey of the most famous and important temples of some of the most famous and greatest gods of Greece, and from that we shall get some idea of the abundance and multitudinousness of these temples and their images, and of the sculp- tures, both the dedicatory and decorative, which enriched them. To begin with Zeus, the great personification of the sky, the all-father of gods and men. The great central home of the worship of Zeus was in a place which is now very famous in our ears, in the valley of Olympia, in the western part of the Peloponnesus. From various circum- stances, this valley of the River Alpheus, in the west of the Peloponnesus, had come to be the common</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OP ARTS, October 12, 1877. 995 theatre of Greece, the place where all men of Greek blood met once in four years for the great athletic contests, during the progress of which all warfare was suspended, and every Greek was for once the true brother of every other Greek. Zeus as the thunderer, the god of sudden celestial phenomena, of storms, rains, and atmospheric disturbances, was thought to have his particular residence in some mountains that protect this valley on the north. This great scene of athletic sports of all the Greeks, was also the great scene of the worship of Zeus. The sports were held under this god's especial patronage, and the two aspects of the festival - the religious and the athletic aspect - were in- separable. The great temple of Olympia was long famous, as not only the great centre of the common religious worship of Greece, but as the place most splendidly adorned by the greatest art of Greece. A new temple was raised and new ornaments added to the temple, in the most flourishing period of Grecian history in the 5th century B.c., the age of Pericles at Athens. We know from ancient accounts what the linea- ments of the god were like, and what the adorn- ments of the temple were. The image specially set up for worship in the temple was an instance in which all the old traditions- the traditions of rigidity and primitivenes - shad been utterly cast aside, in which the greatest genius of the greatest artists in the world had conspired to make the image the most splendid and consummate that could be conceived. This great image of gold and ivory is most minutely described to us by Pausanius, who tells us how it stood in the middle of the shrine, with a figure of victory in one hand, and with an eagle-surmounted sceptre in the other. Then we are given a long account of the various incredible enrichments in mythological subjects, which were wrought, in the same rich materials, upon the arms and the sides of the chair, or throne, upon which the god sat, upon the sandals of his feet, and upon every portion of the sacred image. This central and memorable statue of the Olympian Zeus has utterly and irrevocably perished, and there is no chance that the excavations now going on will bring to light one shred of its gold and ivory. The image, even if it had not been carried away by depredators, would have been long ago destroyed | by neglect and barbarism. These elaborate statues of gold and ivory, put together with in- finite art upon a matrix or framework of wood, required constant care ; there were officers specially appointed to look after their maintenance. The statue had, in some instances, to be sprinkled with water, and, in some instances, to be oiled, to prevent all this elaborate fabric from springing. Now the only clue we have to the splendour of this Olympian Zeus are a few fragments of Greek art in which the type is repeated. There are certain coins in which we have a sitting figure with the sceptre, with the victory and the eagle, copied from the image of the Olympian Zeus. There are a few heads, like the one known as the Jupiter of Otricclai. Otherwise, the aspect of this chief work of Phidias is irrevocably lost to us, and we have to content ourselves with the accessory and comparatively unimportant parts of the ornaments of the temple. Besides this great central image of the god, honoured and worshipped at Olympus, a great many other statues of Zeus crowded the sacred grove which surrounded the temple. For one thing, almost every state in Greece, and almost every great private personage, who at one time or another wanted to propitiate the god in some special way, would set up here his own special statue ; so that among the two thousand or more statues enumerated in the valley of the Alpheus by Pausanias, perhaps more than half were figures in various semblance of this one god Zeus. When- ever anybody was caught cheating at the Olympian games, whenever anybody violated the rules, he was fined, but the money was spent in the purchase of a statue ; so that at the foot of that hill (Kronion), which was the natural grand stand of the Olympian games - and which you can see to this day - where all the people stood, there was a long row of statues of Zeus in bronze, arising entirely from these fines of people who had played false at the games. It is to be feared that im- measurably the majority of the Olympian statues, even of those which were not taken away to Eome in the days of the Roman conquest, have perished. Already the discoveries which have been made there have brought to light the pedestals of many of these statues exactly in the state in which they were when Pausanias saw them, but the statues themselves have disappeared. All the things which have in any abundance been dis- covered belong to the other, the third order of decorative sculpture, which I have spoken of, that which has its origin in the desire of enriching and adorning the temple. From their situation these sculptures of frieze and pediment were not exposed to robbery at the time, and have only come within reach since the destruction and down- fall of the temple itself. It is quite certain, I think, that the most precious remains that will yet be found of Greek art will be - what the most precious remains that have hitherto been found are - remains of the same kind, remains, that is to say, not of the great central works of art, not of the images which stood in the temples, not even any great number of the dedicatory statues which stood round about the temples, but of friezes^ of metopes, of groups set up in the pediments, which have lain buried, since the temple fell, in the soil where modern discovery has found them. We know very well what the subjects of the pediment sculptures, at the Olympian temple of Zeus, were. On the one side there was represented a race be- tween Hippodainia, the daughter of the legendary king of the soil, and the invader Pelops. One pediment represented this race, and between the two groups there stood the figure of Zeus, the only Zeus we have yet recovered from this famous temple, a mutilated figure, not nearly so well carved as we had hoped. On the other side there was another famous scheme of sculpture, showing a very familiar subject, the fight between the Centaurs and the Lapithse, when the Centaurs rushed on the women of the Lapithse, at the marriage feast. A vast amount has been recovered from this pediment, including fragments of both the Centaurs and the women, amongst them ten heads, more or less complete. That is a single typical example of the proportion of what we can, at best, hope to recover of ancient art compared to what was there in the days of its glory. Passing to the other gods and goddesses of the</page><page sequence="4">996 JOURNAL OP THE SOCIETY OP ARTS, October 12, 1877. great Olympian group, there are some more cele- brated in temples, and some less. There are only- two or three of these gods who were especially- associated with festivals and with forms of worship in which the whole of Greece participated on certain anniversaries. The Olympian festival, we have seen, was the festival of all others in which all the Greeks participated. Then the goddess of whom I have spoken, Demeter, the earth mother, had associated with her special rites in which also all the Greeks took part. This second Panhellenic festival was the festival of Demeter at Eleusis. Consequently, that great Eleusinian temple is renowned in all antiquity. What at present remains of it is, first, a few drums and [capitals of columns, not belonging really to the great dome of the temple, but probably to later additions ; over the whole site on which stood the body of the temple - stands now a modern Greek village, Lepsina. Fifty years ago, an Englishman thought he had found the famous central statue of the goddess at Eleusis. There was a great colossal figure, very much shattered, only a fragment of it above the soil, which this Englishman dug away with great labour and brought to England, and it now stands at Cam- bridge. But, such is the vanity of all hopes in these things, unless one goes into the study with the very fullest determination not to see in anything more than is really in it - such is the vanity of too sanguine anticipation in these things, that this reputed statue of the great goddess at Eleusis, which would have been one of the most sacred and memorable remains of Greek art possible to conceive, turns out to be no more than a mere architectural decoration, one of some great row of figures like Caryatides, a figure carrying a great basket on its head, and supporting, probably, the architrave of the building. Of that great temple, then, and that great goddess there remains, for the present, at least, until the village is removed and the soil uncovered, almost notfing. We have to seek for the remains which we do possess at other and less memorable sites. One of the most inter- esting of recent explorations was made on the site of the ancient Cnidus, on the coast of Asia Minor. There was found a kind of private chapel dedicated to these infernal deities - to those earth gods - Demeter and her daughter. This chapel was at the foot of a precipice which runs along just outside the old town of Cnidus, and straight up the precipice there were several niches cut in the rock, and the figure which had stood in one has been recovered, and you may see it now in the British Museum. We must esteem ourselves very lucky indeed when we can recover a type so near as that to the type of what actually proceeded from the Greek hands, of one of the Greek gods, although it is not one that is found at any famous and memorable shrine. There is another goddess (since we can by no means go through them all), whose name will long ago have occurred to you as one of the most celebrated of all, whose type is best known, and whose temples are most familiar, that is the goddess Athene, the especially Athenian goddess of wisdom, of light (physical and intel- lectual), of all kinds of clearness and wisdom. Where are we to go for the great central temple of the great goddess Athene ? Of course, to Athens - to the Athenian Acropolis, and to the Parthenon, its chief temple. What remains of those images of the goddess Athene, which stood upon the Acropolis - either the great out-door image of Athene, the Champion, whose lance and helmet shone for miles over the iEgean as the mariner approached the city, or the gold and ivory image of Athene Parthenos, the virgin that presided within the temple named after it, the Parthenon ? All that we have recovered or really know of that Athene of the Parthenon is almost immeasurably little. There is a little figure rudely carved in marble which corresponds to the description we have of her in the attitude and in the position of the shield. There are a few other fragments, and especially coins, upon which we can trace the type of what once this deity was. As to the decorative sculptures of that temple, you knew how they were, at the beginning of this century, brought away from Athens by Lord Elgin, and constitute the greatest treasure for all who wish to study Greek art, those Elgin marbles now in the British Museum. As you go along the great Elgin room, on the right hand side you will find a number of fragments which I dare say, at first sight, look very little indeed. Opposite where the so- called figures of the Fates are placed, there is a fragment of the body of a woman, just one-half of the chest with the two cross straps of the segis. That is all that remains even of the subordinate ornamental figure of the goddess from the pedi- ment of the Parthenon. That fragment is, for those who care for these things, one of the most sacred and memorable in the world. The remainder of the group from which it comes represents the contest which ended in giving Athene her patron- age over the soil of Athens, the legendary contest between Athene and the sea- god Poseidon. To pass from these great Olympian powers to the lesser powers of the Greek religion and mythology, their name is almost legion. They bewilder almost as much as they enchant our imagination by their very multitudinousness. There is no power of nature itself, and there is no power of the human mind or heart, which is not personified in this way. For instance, there are the powers of wine, of all fertile, inspiriting products of the soil, which were personified in Bacchus and his numerous group of satyrs, fawns, msenads, bas- saride, and all the rest. Bacchus was not one of the greater gods, but, in certain regions of Greece he was especially worshipped - for instance, in Arcadia. His worship again was associated with that of the mystic goddess Demeter at Eleusis, and, in another form, with the worship of Apollo at Delphi. In the decorative sculptures of the temple of Apollo at Delphi there were figures of Bacchus, and we have many Roman repetitions of the types of this god created by the later Attic school, of about 380 b.c. ; the school represented by Praxiteles and Scopas. And Bacchanalian subjects are among those most commonly found in all minor forms of art, such as wall paintings, vase paintings, and especially the relief sculp- ture of that later Roman school. These powers of Bacchus and his train lead us on natu- rally to think of the other nature powers, the powers of rivers, for instance. The great division amongst rivers was this. A river that ran straight ¡ into the sea was, in all cases, thought of as a son</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OP ARTS, Оотовив 12, 1877. 997 of Poseidon ; and the god of such and such a river, as Alpheus or Achelous, was always a male god, sometimes a compound of man and bull ; the energy, the force and rush, the stream and power and roar of the river, were typified to the Greek mind under the likeness of a bull. The Greek imagination continually, as time went on, purified and humanised these hybrid or semi-monstrous conceptions, investing them at least with linea- ments purely mortal. The rivers got to be represented simply, at last, by men of various character and type - that is, the large rivers ; but all the small rivers and mountain streams which run into the large rivers are always women, female nymphs. Thus, you will find, in a group I shall cüscuss in another lecture, a god of the river, the Ilissus, and beside him a female nymph, representing the chief of those little springs which supply the Ilissus close to Athens. Then, there are the winds. The wind figures are variously draped, according to the quarter from whence they come ; thus Boreas is generally warmly draped, to show that he comes from the north, from climes where they require warm drapery. Then there are figures, male or female, for every spring, every grove, every mountain, every valley, every division under which the human mind can possibly think of the influences of nature. And passing from personifications of nature to personifications of the human spirit, we find lineaments more or less appropriate invented for every spiritual and intellectual abstraction that it is possible to think of. The Muses are amongst those which first occur to us. Apollo is constantly associated with a choir of Muses, and each one ©f those nine has a definite character and type, which occur on innumerable preserved works of art. Other personifications are equally familiar, as, for instance, that of Victory. Victory is one of several personifica- tions to which the Greeks nearly always give wings, as they did to other things which are fleet- ing and fugitive, which come suddenly, we know not why, and go again suddenly, we know not why. Victory is such a thing, and therefore the type of Victory is nearly always winged. One of the illustrations on the wall is a special Victory, discovered in the new excavations, of which I have already spoken of, at Olympia. "We have any number of Victories - more than one in the British Museum. Victory intervenes in every contest ; when there is a race there is a Victory hovering near the winner; in war you see one hovering on the side of the combatant who is about to win. Nevertheless, we had not got until lately any great original statue of Victory from the central Greek times. We had the Victory at Brescia, in Italy, which is extremely complete and beautiful, but it is a Roman bronze ; and to possess even the best Roman bronze is not the same thing as to possess even the most shattered fragmen- tary piece of true Greek work of the finest time. There is also in Paris a mutilated colossal Victory of the richest Greek workmanship, found at Samothrace. Last year, at Olympia, the figure before you was unearthed. It was one of the de- dicatory statues set up in celebration of a parti- cular exploit. The figure is in the act of swooping down from a roçk, and ought to be seen on a pedestal some eighteen feet high, the elevation at which it was originally placed. This statue belongs to the central time of Greek art, and, although not comparable for beauty with the most beautiful of the Elgin marbles, yet the manner in which the gesture and the winged motion is shown, the way in which the drapery is made to flow back from the figure like waves from the prow of an advancing ship, is of the utmost grace and spirit. Think of the winged Victory, then, as intervening in a thousand ways in a thousand contests; and thence may the mind pass on to other winged figures - to Love, which was not always represented in the way which is most familiar to us now. The first figures of Eros, or Love, are those of a youth nearly grown to manhood ; it is only in later Greek art that this youth becomes a boy, and a winged boy, a sport- ing, tumbling, mythological figure, whom you see parodying in every kind of manner the occupations of graver people. You see him sometimes running off with all the insignia of the greater gods, imitating all human sports, and intervening in all human festivities. Again, with regard to Death, Sleep and Death are almost indistinguishable in Greek art ; they are both of them winged youths, sad of aspect, and sometimes carrying a reversed torch ; but only when the genius carries a sword are we sure that it is really Death. Probably that beautiful figure which many of you will have noticed in the British Museum, sculptured on a portion of a column recovered from the temple at Ephesus, a naked figure with great wings, having beside him Mercury or Hercules, may represent the god of death, but it is not a figure which occurs very often, or which we can recognise very distinctly. You must dismiss from your minds altogether the notion that in any true Greek times death was ever represented as any thing ugly, bogey, or alarming. That conception of it came only later in the history of the ancient mind. Then there are personifications of a thousand other simple and obvious abstractions of the mind. For. instance, Peace and Plenty - Plenty as the offspring of Peace - one of the famous ancient statues of which the best copies have come down to us is a statue of Peace as a mother holding on her arm Plenty in the shape of a small child with a cornucopia. Let us think, next, of what constitutes a wholly different class, the class of legendary human beings of heroes. Hercules and Theseus are two great and familiar examples, typifying all the beneficient operations of early history, typifying the early purging and purification- of the world from noxious forces. Hercules was the stalwart,, purifying hero who went about purging Greece of all robbers, evils and mischiefs. His figure is one of the most familiar and one of the most favourite of all. We have great statues, like the famous Farnese statue, which are probably copies from the great artists of the fourth century, such as Lysippus, who particularly delighted in this subject. In lesser works, and especially in vase paintings, you find the same hero, a thousand times represented, sometimes in a grotesque and sometimes in a serious form. Just as Hercules was made the popular hero of universal Greece, so Theseus was more particularly the hero of Athens.</page><page sequence="6">998 JOURNAL OP THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, October 12, 1877. Lastly, passing from gods and personifications of all bands of natural powers, and of moral and intellectual powers, and again from legendary- conceptions to conceptions of real life, we find that even the works of art which we possess lay before us pictures from the whole range of Greek and Roman life, representations both of the public events of history and of private records of daily family life - of marriage festivities, and final scenes of parting and of death. It is impossible to establish any sharp division between what is imaginative and what is real in Greek art, because the Greeks seldom represented real scenes without putting in as actors in those real scenes some one or other of these legendary creatures. Thus, in a scene of marriage, or of wooing, the allegorical representation of love, either as Eros, or the other slightly varied embodiments of Love, Desire, or Yearning, will play a part. And thus the per- sonified victory is at hand to intervene in every contest. But here is an instance of history repre- sented in the art; the intervention of preternatural beings as personifications of the group shown in this diagram is one particularly memorable in Greek history. In 476 B.c., the people of Athens set up a new statue in honour of the two friends, Harmodius and Aristogiton, the two tyrannicides of Athens. Comparing with other dates the two figures represented in this diagram, we can restore with complete certainty these two figures into this group, and can tell that they represent that historical group set up by the people of Athens in a particular year after the Persian wars. That is the way in which they commemorated that great event, the deliverance of Athens in the earlier days, and the slaying of the tyrants by Harmodius and Aristogiton. Then, apart altogether from the commemoration of special events, there is the vast class of portrait figures and busts. Portrait statuary was a thing not quite natural to Greek art at its beginnings. There are copies of portraits and recorded portraits of Greeks, as, for instance, of Pericles, Sophocles, Euripides, but in that great time portraiture was always in some degree ideal. It is only later, in the time of Alexander and Lysippus, that realistic portraiture comes in. Perhaps the earliest example we have is one in the British Museum, which is probably the portrait of the Carian prince Mausolus. Going on from portraits, we have representations of religious ceremonies, and sacrifices, and repre- sentations of daily life, of hunting, husbandry, and marriage festivities, almost without end, but chiefly in the latter works of Greek art; a beautiful class of which numerous examples have been lately discovered - representations of death. At Athens, go along an excavated street, and either side of the street is lined with sculptures in relief of which the diagram upon the wall represents an example. All of these are funeral monuments, and in most cases they bear the name of the person in whose honour they are set up. In almost all cases death is represented in the quietest, most reserved, and tranquil, natural way possible, by some scene of ordinary farewell. For instance, a man takes leave of his dog, which jumps up and fawns upon him as he goes away; or a lady sits in her chair, and her servants bring her some ribbon or veil, which she would put on to go out for a walk. That is the subject in this case. You may always know a servant by this particular coif. This example is from almost the best time of Greek art, and is a singularly beautiful thing in the original. The lady, whose name is inscribed as Hegeso, the daughter of Proxenos, sits on a chair, and the servant stands before her with a box ; a ribbon, or the like, she is taking out of the dressing-case is not shown, because it was painted upon the surface, and it is gone. Elsewhere, a mother pats a child under the chin, or lays her arm on the hand of another woman who comes to her, gestures of parting always expressed with the most perfect reserve and delicacy, good-byes of every day that symbolised to the Greek mind the last solemn good-bye of all. These gestures have been otherwise interpreted, and some will tell you that the scenes represent what certainly is represented in Etruscan art - scenes of the dead - that these are not partings of mortal people, but re-unions of people in the under world; that they are scenes representing people meeting in the Elysian fields. But a really close comparison will show that, of the greater number of Attic remains, that is not true. The more we investigate, the more we find that the mystical interpretation of works of that kind, associating them with things occurring in the Elysian fields, will not hold good, but that they belong to the clear, tranquil Athenian genius, satisfied with the things of this world, or, at any rate, not willing to disturb itself with inquiring beyond, and representing the last bitter parting in this delicate, subdued way. No two of these monu- ments are ever quite alike. There is infinite refine- ment in all of them that belong to the good time, and most of them seem obviously and visibly in various ways to deal with that one idea. And so our survey closes. It has necessarily been so rapid that it cannot have given us more than a very crude, and I am afraid muddled notion of the art of Greece, or of what was the multitude and significance of those images which either bodied forth lovely imagined existences or perpetuated deeds of historic fame, or commemo- rated the circumstances of familiar life. Such as our survey has been, it closes not unfitly with this last picture, which represents the preparation of the Greek lady for her last departure, showing with what gentle and collected thoughts the ancient Greek was ready to leave the world which was so full of glory to him, and bid farewell to that life which he spent in the worship, and almost in the companionship of his gods -of those glad and strong and divine existences, himself only one degree less divine, glad, and strong than they.

THE UTILISATION OF SLAG. On the Progress of the Slag Industries during the Last Four Years.* By Mr. Charles Wood, (Tees Iron Works, Middlesbrough.) It is now four years since I had the honour to read before you a short paper upon the " Utilisation of Blast Furnace Slag." I am not aware that at that time (with the exception of the use of slag for road metal), there was a single instance in this country of slag being successfully manu- factured into a commercial commodity, although, as I have mentioned in a paper read before another society, nearly 60 different systems had been patented or tried, resulting only, in many cases, in disappointment, after enormous expenditure of both time and money. At the present moment, I can point out nearly a dozen different classes of goods into which slag is being manu- factured, whilst the different uses to which some of these products are being applied are very various, and are daily on the increase. I have, at the end of this paper, appended a small list, showing a few of the forms into which blast furnace slag is being made, and to what purposes it is being applied. In my former paper I showed you how the slag properly prepared might be employed, but I had nothing to confirm what I there stated. I will now try to prove that all I then suggested has been fully realised, and I will show that the manufacture of slag into mortar, cement, building bricks, and a superior concrete (which will set perfectly in water) is now being carried on at Middlesbrough, and, even in these bad times, at a reasonable profit. In the first place, I may mention that, at the Tees Iron Works, there are three slag sand machines and two slag shingle machines working, and these machines have produced not far short of 100,000 tons, all of which has been utilised in a profitable manner. In order thoroughly to test the value of slag made by my two machines for the various purposes just mentioned, it was thought advisable to form a company that should take up the manufacture as a specialty, and who could devote the time and attention so necessary to a young and untried industry. This company has now been in operation about two years and a half, and, like most new concerns when attempting the manufacture of a fresh material, it has had to pass through a severe ordeal. The difficulties met with have been numerous. The failure of one machine after another, the loss of time, patience, and money, would have ruined many private individuais, but thank« to Messrs. Gilkes, Wilson, Pease, and Co., and to a few friends in the Slag Company, I have been enabled to pass through the ordeal, and I am thankful to say that neither their confidence, money, nor time is likely to be lost ; but that there is every pro- bability that, with a larger output and a revival of trade, their capital will receive a fair dividend. The Cleveland Slag Company's works are situated near the docks at Middlesbrough, and are now paying between £60 and £70 per week in wages. The most important part of their manufacture is slag bricks for building purposes, made from the slag sand, produced by the slag sand machines at the blast furnaces. This sand is mixed with selenitic lime (General Scott's patent), with an addition of iron oxide, and is pressed in a machine hereafter to be described. • Paper road before the Iron and Steel Institute at Neiroastle. The next article of importance manufactured at these works is a kind of hydraulic cement, made from the slag sand, common lime, and iron oxides. Compared with Portland cement for hydraulic work or concrete, this is the most valuable product introduced for many years, whilst its price is not one-fourth, and the strength little inferior. Concrete made from this cement, mixed with the shingle produced from the rotary table, is an excellent conglomerate for use in monolithic structures. With this material I have executed some very heavy blast engine foundations - in one case where brickwork set in cement had previously failed. The concrete is now standing in the most perfect manner. The cost of tbie concrete is only about one-fourth that of the brickwork, and experience has shown that it goes on hardening for months. The building of the Slag Company's works is executed entirely in this material - the walls being nearly 80 ft. high - they were built entirely by labourers, without a single bricklayer, and the cost of the work when finished, including superintendence, did not exceed six shillings per cubic yard. To give an idea of the strength of the walls, I may mention that on one or two occasions we have had to cut doorways through them, and it has taken two good men with steel bars and sledge hammers as much as four days to cut through a thickness of about 26 in. Mortar is also made and sold in large quantities from a mixture of slag sand, and about Ю per cent, of com- mon slaked lime, and it can be sold at the cheap rate of about 4s. per ton. The introduction of these various products from slag at first met with a good deal of opposition and prejudice from architects and builders, but the remarkable strength and cheapness of the material soon compelled these gentlemen to admit their error, and I am happy to say that our demand in some instances is now more than the production. As before stated, the most important branch of the business carried on by the Cleveland Slag Company is the manufacture of building bricks, and, although the process is now very simple, it has been here that the greatest difficulties have occurred. There was no machine made in England that could work the material in the state in which it is produced at the furnaces, without previous preparation ; and to prepaie the material to suit the brick press meant that the cost of the bricks became so high as to exclude them from the market. A press had, therefore, to be designed that would work the slag sand just as it comes from the slag sand machines directly into bricks, and this being accomplished, suc- cess was assured. In designing this machine, the following points had to be kept in view, viz., great depth of moulds, because the slag sand is very spongy and fcompressible ; an arrangement by which the water could escape from the moulds without blowing the bricks to pieces ; great pressure, in order to consolidate the sand in the moulds ; safety against over pressure, in case too much or too hard a material should get into the moulds ; and great care in mixing the lime with the slag sand in fixed proportions, as well as great regularity in filling the moulds. These requirements are fully met by the brick press which I shall now describe, and which is, in my opinion, one of the safest, and most powerful me- chanical brick presses ever made. The pressure is given by two cast steel cams, which are fixed upon a forged steel shaft in. in diameter. This shaft, resting on bearings between two strong frames, is put in motion by very powerful double geared spur wheels, the first motion shaft having a fly-wheel upon it to steady and equalise the pull upon the strap. The pressure cams act against rollers fixed upon two steel cylinders or rams. These rams transmit the pressure to the moulds in a table. The table is circular, and contains six pairs of moulds, so that four bricks are</page><page sequence="8">1000 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, Оотовив 12, 1877. pressed at one time, the table remaining stationary during the operation. At the same time the bricks are being pressed, two other pairs of moulds are being filled up with material - whilst the other two pairs are delivering up the four bricks pressed at the previous revolution of the cam shaft. The brieks are pushed out of the mould by smaller pistons acted upon by separate cams. The moulds are lined with changeable steel plates T3-g- in. thick, and the sand and lime is fed into them by two pug mills. These pug mills are fitted with six knives each, so as the more thoroughly to mix and chop the spongy slag along with the lime. The table is shifted round by a kind of ratchet motion, also worked by a cam on the outside of the framework, and acting upon the weigh bar and levers. Immediately above the pressure cylinders are two pressure stops, which are held down by the heavy- weighted levers. These levers, therefore, receive the whole pressure put upon the bricks, and in case there should be too much sand getting into the moulds they simply lift up and relieve the strain. The weights can be weighed at option, and thus form an exact gauge of the pressure upon the bricks. The moulds are generally filled so as just to lift the levers in ordinary work. The filling is easily regulated by the set of the knives on the pug shafts, which press the material into the moulds, and one side of the pug mill cylinder is made to open so that the knives are accessible at any moment. The pug mills are filled by means of the measuring and mixing apparatus placed on the floor immediately above the brick press. The mixing and measuring apparatus is very simple and efficient, and works without any trouble. The slag sand is tipped into a hopper by large barrows, which are lifted up by a hoist. At the bottom of this hopper there is a revolving cylinder, with ribs cast upon it, which, revolving under the hopper, carries a certain thickness of sand, the thickness having been previously regulated to the requirements of the press. The slag then falls upon a sieve, which separates any large pieces of slag in a solid state, and at the same time allows the falling sand through the sieve to fall like a shower. The lime is fed into a separate hopper, and is regulated very much like the feed of corn into millstones. The lime then passes down a shoot, which forms part of the slag sand sieve, where it meets the shower of sand - falling together with it - thus getting thoroughly mixed. As before stated, this lime is selenitic lime, and is pre- pared upon the works. The bricks, when taken from the brick press, are placed upon spring barrows, holding fifty each. They are then taken and stacked in sheds, where they are allowed to remain about five or six days, after which they are simply stacked outside in the weather to harden. The per-centage of loss is very little, not amounting to two or three per cent. In fact, when once the bricks are upon the barrows, there is little or no waste. Each machine is capable of turning out about 10,000 bricks per day, and, since starting, we have sold about 4,000,000. Large quantities are shipped to London at a cost of 17s. to 18s. per 1,000 for freight; in other words, about 10,000 tons of slag sand has been consumed for this purpose alone. The following are a few of the advantages of these concrete slag sand bricks, viz.: - Being pressed, they are perfectly uniform in size and thickness; they are much cheaper than ordinary red bricks, compared in weight with which they will weigh one ton per thousand less, then there is this further advan- tage that there are no wasters or halves. For inside work there is a great saving both in bricklaying and mortar, more especially when plastering; the walls being of a uniform thickness ; and the bricklayers like them, because they can do more work with less labour, the bricklayer's labourer finding he has a ton per thousand lees to carry, as well as considerably less mortar. Another remarkable property of the slag bricks is that the joiners can drive nails directly into them without splitting, and thus, for skirting and doorwork, they are saved much trouble in plugging the walls ; and, finally, the longer the bricks are kept the harder they get. I can now confidently say that for many months past we have been steadily working away at the various pro- ducts mentioned in this paper, and that with the excep- tion of a little outlay for the purpose of increasing our output, we have laid out no money upon experiments or works. The task, however, has been a severe one. "When I designed the mill, I brought to my assistance some of the most experienced millwrights in England - men accustomed to machinery for manipulating hard and gritty substances ; and yet there is scarcely a piece of machinery on the works, with the exception of the engine and shafting, that haS not either been abandoned, re- designed, or rebuilt, in order to adapt the machines to this peculiar material, the extraordinary cutting nature of which seem to destroy everything with which it came into contact. In proof of this, I may mention two facts, viz., that in six hours' working, the fields and furrows in a pair of French burr millstones, intended for Portland cement grinding, were completely obliterated, whilst the hardest steel bars in a Carr's disintegrator were cut completely through after six or eight days' constant running. The position of an engineer and an inventor under these circumstances - standing as he does between failing ma- chinery and the angry directors of a limited company, in times like these - is one which has only to be experienced to be thoroughly appreciated ; but, thanks to Messrs. Gilkes, Wilson, Peace, and Co., and to one or two practical men among the directors, I have been enabled, through their aid and confidence, to carry the thing to a successful issue. In addition to the works and progress made by myself at the Tees Iron Works and the Cleveland Slag Working Company's Works, I must not forget the labour and success obtained by my friend Mr. Henry Hobson, engineer at the Moss Bay Iron Works, Cumberland.^ Mr. Hobson has taken a path different, as far as I know* to any of his predecessors, inasmuch as in making bricks he first of all pulverises the solid slag, and uses no lime whatever. By this system the slag is taken from the solid slag balls, made from hematite Bessemer iron, and broken into pieces sufficiently small to pass under very massive edge runners, where it is ground or crushed by the sheer weight of the runners into small dusty shingle. It is then passed by elevators into French burr mill- stones, and ground into powder. From the stones it passes directly into the brick press without any admixture of lime or any other aid except that of being well damped with water before pressing. This brick press also has a rotary table, and the material is fed into the moulds recessed therein by hand. The pressure given from above by a self-acting cam, put in action by the continuous rotary motion of the table, the bricks come out well pressed and are of excellent shape, and there appears to be no doubt about the quality. At the same time, they have a great many wasters. The bricks are very heavy, and the cost of grinding the slag entails a heavy and expressive plant, with, I fear, a large amount of wear and tear. The large amount of lime in the slag made while producing Bessemer iron seems to be sufficient, when treated in this way, to reunite the pulverised slag and to "set" in a most remarkable manner. I can only account for this setting property by supposing that the slag, when pulverised in the dry state in which it comes from the furnace, takes up a large amount of water, and forms a hydrated compound of silicate of lime and alumina, and thus reunites the mass in the same way as Portland or Roman cement.* • I have given an analysis of an average sample of Bessemer and Cleveland slpg at the end of my paper for referenoe.</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OP ARTS, Ootobbr 12, 1877. 10Ö1 On the other hand, this excess of lime is often very dangerous, as the slag, after exposure to the air or an excess of moisture, often swells and falls into powder, and bricks made from it are liable to fall to pieces. This, however, is not the case with Cleveland slag, nor, I think, with any except with that made from hematite ore Ttrith an excess of lime. The next process in successful operation is that known as Woodward's, and, although a revival of a very old method, I must certainly give that gentleman, and those who have worked the thing out at the furnaces, a great deal of credit for their perseverance, and for the success at which they have arrived. I must also, in all honesty to them, say that most of their manufactured articles are of a very serviceable nature. They are, however, only employed for footpaths, roads, &amp;c., being totally unfit for building purposes. As at present worked, the process is not at all complicated, but only certain qualities of slag are suitable, and at times when the furnaces are " changing " the number of wasters is enormous, while the works have sometimes to be stopped for days. The elag is run direct from the furnaces into moulds ranged round the outside of a large rotary table. The machine or table remains stationary whilst each separate mould is being filled, the table is moved by hand, thus con- stantly presenting empty ntoulds to the stream of molten slag. As soon as the slag becomes set in the moulds a catch is knocked away, and the bottom of the mould drops down upon a hinge and the brick or block falls out. It is then taken into annealing ovens, where the temperature is raised to nearly a white heat, after which it is allowed to cool. The high price obtained in the market for these goods enables the company to meet their expenses, but, I believe, up to the present time they have not done more than this. The goods they produce are very hard, uniform in size, and look well when laid ; but they are liable to crack, particularly in winter, and as before mentioned there are many objections to their ever being employed as building material. At the Leeds meeting of this institute last year, Mr. Bashley Britten introduced to your notice his novel system of making glass from blast furnace slag. Mr. Britten, it will be remembered, proposed to take the molten slag in a ladle from the blast furnace and to pour it into a Siemens furnace, where certain additions of carbonate of soda and silica are added according to the quality of the slag used and the glass to be produced. I am very glad to learn from Mr. Britten that the ex- tensive experiments which have been carried on during the year have proved perfectly successful, and that, under the title of " Britten's Patent Glass Company," for which Mr. Herbert Canning is the secretary, large works are being built at Finedon, in Northamptonshire, where in a few months they will be ready to manufacture large quantities of glass bottles. These bottles on the tables are made entirely by this process. I have now only one more product from slag to mention. It is that of slag wool, or, as it is sometimes called, silicate cotton, from its great resemblance to cotton wool. The manufacture of slag wool has often been attempted in England, but I believe only with partial success. I have, however, learned from Mr. -Edward Williams that many years ago Mr. Edward Parry made a large quantity of it in Wales, although that, in consequence of the injurious effect upon the men, it had to be abandoned. The manufacture is now carried on at the Tees Iron Works, and I can safely assert, without the slightest inconvenience, either to the men in the vard. or even to the man who makes it. The process is extremely simple. A jet of steam is made to strike upon the stream of molten slag as it falls from the usual runner into the slag bogies or waggons. This jet scatters the molten slag into shot, and as each shot leaves the stream it carries a fine thread or tail with it ; the shot, being heavy, drops into the ground, whilst the fine woolly fibre is sucked into a large tube and discharged into a chamber. This chamber is very large, and is covered with fine wire netting or sieve wire. The steam and air carry the woolly particles all over the chamber - the finest into recesses formed for the purpose ; the heavier into the body of the chamber. After each blowing it is selected and taken up with forks and put into ¿arge casks or bags for shipment or otherwise. The inside of the chamber repre- sents a most remarkable and curious spectacle after each blowing. The wool, as will be seen by the samples on the table, is of a snowy-white appearance. Slag wool, or silicate cotton, is chiefly employed to cover steam boilers, pipes, &amp;c. Messrs. Jones, Dade, and Co., of London, are the sole agents for its sale, and they have taken out one or two patents for its application. The most noteworthy of these is for what they term mattresses, some of which they have kindly forwarded for inspection. These are about 2 ft. to 3 ft. long, and 1 ft. wide, by 2 J in. thick. The mattresses are laid upon the boiler or pipes to be covered, and are secured in the usual way. Its perfect incombustibility, combined with its non-con- ducting and indestructible properties, give this material many advantages over any other for this class of work.

THE TELEPHONE. On the evening of Thursday, the 4th inst., at a con- versazione, held at the Public Hall, Leamington, during the Congress of the Sanitary Institute, one of the attractions of the evening was the exhibition of the telephone, which was explained by Mr. A. Le Neve Foster. It had been arranged that Prof. Bell would himself have given a description of the instrument, as well as some explanation of its practical uses, but unfortunately, through ill health, he was unable to be present. In his absence Mr. Foster undertook to explain and exhibit the instrument. The telephones were connected by a short line of overhead wire between the Pump-room and the Hall, a distance of about half a mile. The line was one of the ordinary post-office lines. After giving a short explanation of the instruments, Mr. Foster remarked that, although the telephone had only been now commercially established in America some three or four months, there were already about 1,500 instruments in practical про in America, that the system was rapidly increasing, and replacing for com- mercial purposes on private wires, to a large extent, the various forms of А В С and other instruments hitherto employed. He stated that the greatest distance in America over which the telephone had been successfully worked was between New York and Boston, a distance of some 240 miles. Whilst in England, at the late meeting of the British Association at Plymouth, Mr. Preece had successfully established telephonic com- munication between Exeter and Plymouth with most satisfactory results, thus proving the adaptability of the telephone for comparatively long distances. ♦ Col. Reynolds (who, with Prof. Bell, is about estab- lishing the telephonic system in England) undertook the arduous duty of attending to the telephone at the Pump-room and answering the numerous questions that were addressed to him from the Hall, through the tele- phone, by the various guests assembled. The telephones used - manufactured by the Silvertown Telegraph Works- were of the type as at present employed for commercial purposes, a description of which appeared in the Journal of September 14. These instruments, although small, have been found sufficient to meet the requirements of this class of work. Atten- tion is called by the ringing of a small bell at the receiving station. The bell is actuated by a current of electricity generated by a small magnetic machine at the sending station, thus entirely dispensing with the use of a battery. Two telephones are usually connected in circuit at each end of the line, so that the operator can always hold one to his ear and speak through the other ; this greatly facilitates telephonic communication, and prevents delays that might be caused through the operators at each end of the line speaking at the same time. The exhibition of the telephone, on the whole, was a success, Col. Reynolds stating, on his return to the Hall, that he could distinctly hear, when at the Pump-room, listening at the telephone, the band playing in the Hall, as also the applause of the audience. OBITUARY. Major -General Eardley-Wilmot, H.A., F.R.S. - Major-General Frederick M. Eardley-Wilmot died on Sunday, September 30th, at Fox-hills, near Chertsey, aged 65. He was the second son of Sir John Eardley- Wilmot, first baronet, and entered the army in 1830. He served part of the campaign of 1846-47 against the Kaffirs as Deputy- Assistant Quartermaster- General, and also served in Canada. At one time he was Director of Gun Factories at Woolwich, and he served on many Government committees on military matters, and was frequently consulted on scientific and educational sub- jects connected with the army. His connection with this Society commenced as long ago as 1849, and he was soon elected on the Council. He served first as Captain, and then as Lieut.-Col. Eardley-Wilmot on the Council till 1855, when he went abroad on foreign service. In 1869 he was again elected on the Council, and in 1871 he became Chairman. This office he held for two years, and the energy he devoted to its duties will be fresh in the memories alike of the members of the Council and of the members generally. It was a cause of deep regret to all associated with him when failing health obliged him last year to give up his attendance at the Council meetings. Since then he gradually became worse until his death. His name appeared in the recent list of promotions in the Gazette , but his death took place the day before that upon which his promotion would have dated, October 1st. Of General Eardley- Wilmoťs private character, this is, perhaps, hardly the place to say much, but this brief notice cannot be closed without at least an allusion to the singularly high- minded and noble nature which ensured him the respect, and, indeed, won him the affection of all with whom he came in contact. GENERAL NOTES. Herva-maté Cultivation. - Mr. O' Conor, in his report upon the industries of Brazil, mentions that the cultivation and preparation of herva-maté, which is largely exported from the province of Parma to the neighbouring countries of Uruguay, Paraguay, and the Argentine Confederation, has not yet become an article of commerce for European markets, and this will be regretted by those who nave experienced what a capital substitute it is for either tea or coffee. In its nature more fortifying and alimentary, and far more wholesome, it can be bought at a price so moderate that it would easily be within the means of the poorest inhabitants of Ireland or Scotland, and there can be no doubt that if it were once known it would be extensively used in place of the far more expensive and constantly adulterated beverages of tea and coffee. A small sum has been appropriated by the Minister of Agriculture with a view to make this excellent plant known in Europe, and it is sincerely to be hoped that the experiment will be produc- tive of beneficial results.
