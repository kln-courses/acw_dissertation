(54.183) 68</page><page sequence="2">The Artist and the Other: The Work of Winslow Homer Christopher Reed In a generation when the romance of the artist s studio sparked images as diverse as Thomas Eakins' fantasies of William Rush s sturdy workshop or William Merritt Chase and Louis Comfort Tiffany's celebrations of the atelier as upper-crust salon, Winslow Homer (1836-1910) left no pictures of his workspace. Among the very few interiors he painted, none depict his family's comfortable middle-class homes or hunting lodges. There are just a few interiors vaguely defined by a prop - a chair, a window, or wainscoting - isolated in a void, but the only rooms pictured as coherent spaces are those that would have been for Homer foreign territory: Black sharecroppers' homes, farmhouses, country schools, and stores. There are no paintings of American cities by this child of Boston and resident of New York. There are no self-portraits. Art, for Homer, was not self-analysis. His gaze, instead, was directed always outside, at embodiments of what has been termed the Other: that against which the self is defined. l Although this characterization of Homers painting may initially sound nebulous, its application to his work can be charted quite specifically. Moreover, the rubric of Otherness draws together the diverse subjects that appear in Homers art, unifying an oeuvre that has been hitherto described as vaguely mysterious or randomly eclectic. Women and children, Blacks, maritime coasts, the Adirondack and Canadian wildernesses, all of these varied themes can be seen as different facets of a coherent project to investigate the conditions of Otherness. Most obviously, Homers subjects embody both sexual and racial Otherness, so defined in opposition to the artist as a specific white man, and to broader cultural norms that posit white men as the standard. On a deeper level, his work thematizes, as well, conventional constructions of the category of "human" against an Other that is "nature." Finally, Homers late work engages the relationship of Otherness we posit to distinguish 69 lived experience from art. It is this last category of opposition that gives Homers late paintings the "modernist" edge that has ensured his reputation even among the champions of twentieth-century American art for whom typical nineteenth-century illustrative painting holds little charm.2 Modern critics, however, have been too quick to dismiss the relevance of Homers subjects to his artistic accomplishment, claiming that he simply availed himself of "local subjects largely as vehicles for the range of formal inventions that concerned him. "3 When seen in the context of the subjects to which Homer devoted his attention, his technical and formal innovations begin to appear less anomalous, and more like part of a coherent intellectual project. Homer is probably best known for his seascapes and his images of women, two themes which are not unrelated. Their connection is clearest in his popular images of fisherwomen, their aprons swelling out like the sails on the sea behind them, or their bodies entwined in wavelike nets, as in Inside the Bar (1883; Fig. 1). Even when such explicit visual echoes are absent, however, analogous associations of mystery, beauty, and power link Homer s presentations of women and the sea. In the world of Homers paintings, the ocean exercises its attraction over a wide spectrum of humanity, from fashionable ladies to little boys and fisherfolk, all of whom are shown staring into the waves. This attraction is combined, however, with enigma and even danger, as the sea refuses to grant what its viewers seek. No one returns the shorebound figures gaze; if there are sails on the horizon they are not headed for shore, if there are lines in the water they are not tugged by fish. Alluring to all, but satisfying none, the sea offers as its only bounty frightening seaweed, mysterious driftwood, or unexpected corpses (Figs. 6, 7), all tokens of its mysterious and violent power. Women, even when distant from the sea, share its qualities. David Park Curry has explicated the</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 Winslow Homer, Enchanted, 1874. Oil on canvas. Courtesy of Kennedy Galleries, Inc., New York. sexual tension present in the towering, mallet- wielding females of Homers early croquet scenes. 4 A series of watercolors from the mid-i87os of single figures, all apparently from the same model, has prompted a degree of over- ingenious storytelling to account for its unsettling amalgam of fascination and distance. A facile chronology tracing "a love affair that went from idyllic to agitated to unsalvagable"5 does not account for the enigmatic aura of reserve that characterizes the series steadily from images like Fresh Eggs (1874) at its beginning, to such concluding examples as Blackboard (1877). 6 Throughout, the model turns her back or averts her eyes from the artist/viewer, refusing his gaze. Where she meets his glance most forthrightly, in Shall I Tell Your Fortune (1876), her access to a mysterious supernatural knowledge is overtly thematized by the pack of cards with which she offers to predict the future. The association of women, the sea, mysterious attraction, and dangerous power is not uncommon. From Classical mythology to the psychoanalytic theories of Carl Jung, patriarchy has troped the feminine with the sea as twin embodiments of something man cannot master. Within this tradition, however, Homer underlines his construction of the female/sea as Other by contrasting it explicitly with its opposite: man and land. Standing as the conceptual foil to his maritime imagery are Homers pictures of waterways in Canada and the Adirondacks. Unlike the sea, these inland waterways succumb easily to mans control, offering access to an abundant bounty of game, fish, and timber. At their most violent, they are Whitewater rapids tamed by hunters in canoes. Here there are no wrecks and no corpses, save those of the animals men have easily- sometimes too easily?- slaughtered. Free of danger, these inland waters are free, as well, of women. Though his contemporaries were complaining that the once-wild Adirondack 70 wilderness "has blossomed with parasols and the waste places are filled with picnic parties,"8 Homers mountain streams and lakes are populated only by men, who enjoy, or exploit, the land without constraint. In the bucolic farm scenes where Homer does bring male and female together, their interaction serves only to accentuate a fundamental separation. If they are physically proximate, one figure averts his or her eyes from the gaze of the other, often staring instead at an animal distanced by a fence or stretch of empty space. More typically, male and female are themselves separated by a fence, a wall, or by a curiously unbreachable space, as for example in Enchanted (1874; Fig. 2), where the static poses of the boys and the girl they observe are emphasized by the low horizon that seems to pin them to the field. While in Homers schoolyard scenes, pre-adolescent boys link arms and hands, or ride piggyback on one another, children are rigidly segregated by sex, so much so that in The Country School (1871; St. Louis Art Museum) a little boy cries to find himself consigned to the girls' side. The separation between male and female persists into adulthood in Homers imagery. Nowhere in his paintings do men and women join in a voluntary embrace, though women, both fashion-plates and fishwives, easily enjoy physical contact, even dancing together by the moonlit waves in A Summer Night (1890; Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris). When, in Four Fishwives (1881; Fig. 3), women carrying baskets and children (talismans of their sexuality?) march toward the men who return from the sea bearing long, flapping fish (difficult to ignore!), the effect is of negotiators advancing from opposed armies. And between these two contingents, the crowd in the background parts to reveal an infinite void: the unbroken vista out to sea. When, in both Early Evening (1881, 1907; Freer Gallery of Art) and To the Rescue (1886, 1907; Phillips Collection), a man approaches an unsuspecting female couple,</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3 Winslow Homer, Four Fishwives, 1 88 1.

Bequest of George Roberts, B.A. 1905. 1968.87 71</page><page sequence="5">Homer makes his presence a dangerous intrusion. In the first case, he carries a spyglass; in the second, a noose. An early print, Two are Company, Three Are None (1872) literalizes the threat to the female couple posed by the intrusion of the male, as the woman in the foreground hurries anxiously away from her companion who, left at the waters edge, has her attentions monopolized by a man. Conversely, in the watercolor Fishgirls (1881), a group of women works peacefully beneath a ghostly set of hanging gaiters. Integral to the atmosphere of tranquility is the obvious absence of the male body, an effect reinforced by Homers inclusion of the tiny chicken and rooster competing in the background. That Homer sets these anxious images of sexual interaction on the boundary of land and sea is appropriate to their theme of opposing forces brought into contact. The juncture of water with land, and male with female, is closest in the well- known Lifeline (1884; Philadelphia Museum of Art) and Undertow (1886; Clark Art Institute), where the overtones of violence and danger are likewise most pronounced. Such histrionics, however, are rare in Homers painting. As a rule, male and female remain locked in watchful contemplation, seemingly unable to touch or speak. Recognizing Homers pairing of women and the sea allows this theme of the gaze between opposites to emerge even in works like the Yale Art Gallery's Below Zero (1894; Fig. 4), where it animates the more obvious opposition of humanity and sea. Although the Other that is the object of the men's gaze is a burst of spray, its anthropomorphic echo of their form renders the relationship between the three "figures" in Below Zero analogous to the watchful dynamic of Otherness in Enchanted. Although Homer is not rigidly consistent in his opposition of woman and ocean to man and shore, the images that are exceptions are, if anything, more indicative of his deep interest in the processes that create relations of Otherness. In Watching the 72 Breakers (1896; Canajoharie Library), for example, an apparently female figure joins the men confronting the burst of spray. It is, however, precisely their opposition to this towering form that allows male and female to be drawn together into a relationship of common humanity, defined against the natural Other of the spray whose shape reflects their own. Likewise, Homer draws male and female into relative proximity in Carnival (1877; Metropolitan Museum of Art), only to suggest that their unification is the product of another dynamic of Otherness. In the foreground, a Black man is being dressed as a clown by two female figures, though even in this image of intimacy, Homer represents the women's hands pulling away from the male body. Recent historical research has revealed the festive occasion to be Jonkonnu, a New Year's celebration in which enslaved blacks were allowed access to parts of the plantations that were off-limits the rest of the year. Massed together on one side of a fence behind which rises the double chimneys of the main house, Black men and women are bound together through their opposition to the white culture outside their enclosure, just as in Watching the Breakers, the sexes are united in opposition to the wave. The tiny American flag in Carnival makes explicit the political contradictions of Jonkonnu in Reconstruction America, when the mechanisms of racial segregation were in a state of realignment. 9 Not just Carnival, but the entire scope of Homers images of Black America may be understood in the context of his fascination with how relationships of Otherness are established. Homer was among the first American painters to make thoughtful use of Black life in his art, and his work was quickly recognized as standing apart from the "pitiable caricatures of negroes" that filled contemporary magazines and galleries. IO Several recent studies have traced Homers growing interest in Black life, as he moved from clich√©d exoticism</page><page sequence="6">Fig- 5 Winslow Homer, Near Andersonville (At the Cabin Door), 1865-66.

As Mary Ann Calo writes: "the pivotal work in his treatment of Negroes is also the only known painting from this [Civil War] period in which a black woman is his principal subject."12 Unlike the cartoonish characters in Homers earlier depictions of Blacks, the central female figure displays the pensive calm and monumental stature for which Homers fisherwomen have become famous. Self- evidently powerful, her thoughts a mystery, she stands in obvious contrast to the ragtag band of white men - here Union prisoners led under a Confederate flag - on whom her definition as citizen or slave (political Other) rests. The recent discovery of the allusion to one of the Confederacy's most brutal prison camps in this paintings original title, Near Andersonville, underlines the poignancy of the woman's predicament, her status dependent on forces outside her control.1 3 Relegating the soldiers to the margin of the painting where they are gracelessly cropped by the canvas edge, Homer focuses instead on the central figure of the Black woman framed in the door. Refusing to impute to her the clich√©d emotions that would allow a White 73 audience the intellectual mastery of seeming to know her thoughts, Homer in this early work sets the terms for an oeuvre that will make the Other a central theme. Homer continued his thematization of racial Otherness, returning to the South after the war to paint images like Weaning the Calf (1875; North Carolina Museum of Art), Visit from the Old Mistress (1876; National Museum of American Art), and Watermelon Boys (1876; Cooper- Hewitt Museum), all of which make explicit issue of the racial difference between otherwise like figures of women or children. The Cotton Pickers (1876; Los Angeles County Museum of Art) and Upland Cotton (1876) return to the themes of massive and stoic Black women. As enigmatic and powerful as any of Homers fishwives by the sea, they serve analogously as emblems of a sea of cotton, its fuzzy bolls echoing the painterly texture of Homers waves. Ten years after his second voyage across the Mason-Dixon Line, Homer accepted a magazine assignment to go to the Caribbean. There, he discovered ready-made a culture that brought together the tropes of Otherness he had seen before only in isolation: Black workers and the sea.

Gift of Allen Evarts Foster, B.A. 1906. 1965.33.356 Homer portrays Black life in a series of strong and static women, but this time they are complemented by muscular men, stripped to the waist, at work in and on the water. Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Homer came increasingly to focus on these male figures and the sea, combining a number of his watercolor sketches into studies for what may be his best-known painting, The Gulf stream (1899; Metropolitan Museum of Art). While at work on this picture of a Black sailor lashed to the deck of his wrecked craft, Homer experimented with other arrangements of the same elements. Most notable is the watercolor After the Hurricane (1899; Fig. 6), a coda to The Gulfstream showing a shipwrecked Black sailor cast up on shore with the remains of 74 his craft. *4 Here the Black man replays the role of the White woman in Homers earlier shipwreck scenes, echoing most closely an early Harper's illustration, The Wreck of the "Atlantic" - Cast up by the Sea (1873; ^ig. 7). In both, the waves have deposited on shore a body, ambiguously unconscious yet alluring. Both figures seem mysteriously allied to the sea, the woman with the rippling folds of her shift reminiscent both of waves and a mermaids tail, the man, as Helen Cooper has described him, analogously semi-aquatic: His legs are concealed by the¬ªremains of the stern and rudder, which Homer arranged to suggest an enormous tail or fin, thereby giving the overall contour of man and wrecked boat the form of a huge aquatic creature.1 5</page><page sequence="8">Homer s conflation of Black man and sea creature echoes the relationship he earlier established between the waves and sails and the fishwives, who became emblems of the sea. Unlike the universal resonance of the woman-ocean trope, however, Homers presentation of Black men participates in a specifically American paradigm, which Leslie Fiedler has traced in nineteenth- century literature. Richard Henry Dana, Jr. s Two Years Before the Mast (1840), James Fenimore Coopers Leatherstocking Tales (1823-41), Herman Melville's Moby Dick (185 1), and Mark Twains Huckleberry Finn (1884), says Fiedler, are exemplary of an American archetype of homoerotic bonding with the racial Other, set in the strange immensity of ocean or vast river: "there is a context in which the legend of the sea as escape and solace, the fixated sexuality of boys, the myth of the dark beloved, are one."16 Fiedler points to the physical and spiritual bond that links Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook, Ishmael and Queequeg, Huck Finn and Nigger Jim in texts that are cornerstone to the socialization of American youth, concluding that the underside of American racial segregation is an archetypal fantasy of reunification with those we have relentlessly constructed as Other. Fiedlers paradigm is useful for creating a cultural context in which to understand Homers images of Black men, especially the identification with them that he seems to propose in The Turtle Pound (1898), where the artists signature echoes the condition of the figures, half submerged in the waves. This subtle gesture pushes the attraction between artist and subject to a metaphysical plane beyond any purely sexual scenario, though, of course, the two are not mutually exclusive. The comparison o√≠ After the Hurricane and Wreck of the "Atlantic" reveals that the erotic interest, which critics have long been happy to recognize in the clinging garments of Homers women pulled from the waves, is equally present in the "muscled and gleaming"1? prone body of his Black male victim, whose semi-nudity is all the more emphatic in an oeuvre without formal nudes. This interchangeability of women and Black men in Homers imagery suggests that underlying the sexual tensions in his work is the Fiedlerian dream of unification with the Other, expressed through the dissolution of boundaries between subject and object that characterizes the erotic. Male and female, humanity and the sea; the potential to reunite both these binaries in the figure of a Black is most strikingly demonstrated among Homers Caribbean images in Under the Coco Palm (1898; Fig. 8). Here, against idyllic palm fronds of a fantastical bright blue and orange, a Black youth drinks from a coconut. Like the wrecked boat that became a fin for the victim in After the Hurricane, a. shard of fallen palm stem gives the boy the look of a mermaid with a fish's tail - at once man/ woman and human/sea- creature. This supernatural androgyny is emphasized by the ineluctably breast-like overtones of the coconut from which the youth drinks. Homer has here composed the darker tones to lead the eye in a circle from coconut to head, down around the elbows, and up to nut again in a cycle of self-sufficient desire and gratification that might be taken as a fantasy of reversing what some psychoanalysts posit as the infant's first distinction between Self and Other experienced in relation to the maternal breast.18 Fiedler notes that the topos of bonding with the outcast Other comes into play when we ourselves feel attacked, excluded, and alone, "when we have been cut off, or have cut ourselves off' - in short, when we feel ourselves defined as Other by some greater collective. ^ The threat of an Other with Fig. 8 Winslow Homer, Under the Coco Palm, 1898.

Courtesy of the Penn- sylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. superhuman strength or mystical knowledge, an Other powerful enough to overwhelm an isolated target, is always latent in Homers imagery. It becomes explicit in his images of fishermen in danger and animals under attack. In Kissing the Moon (1904; Addison Gallery of American Art), the ocean waves peak so high over a tiny fishing boat in a trough between them that only the heads of its three passengers remain visible, riding disembodied on the crest, about to be subsumed. In The Fox Hunt (1893; Fig. 9), Homer returns to the punning signature, here to identify himself with a fox who, half-buried and almost immobilized in the snow, is attacked by powerful black crows that come from the sea - both narratively in that they wheel around from behind the low clump of grass as if rising from the beach, and compositionally in that they descend from the pictures blue upper register representing sky and ocean. It is possible to over-specify the nature of the threat these crows represented to Homer,20 but the importance he attached to the motif is undeniable. He returned to his studio in Maine one winter specifically to create this image, and took special pains with the birds. 2 * One of Homers last works, Right and Left (1909; National Gallery of Art), extends the theme of identification with an endangered animal. Here the artists - and thus the viewers - vantage point is one with the ducks under lethal fire from an ocean- going hunter below. As in The Fox Hunt, Homer here collapses the distinction, basic in Western culture, between human and the animal Other. This conflation may help to explain why these and analogous images seem to critics resonant at once of Oriental art and "self-forgetfulness."22 Homers alliance with animals under attack - a bonding proposed as so powerful that man actually becomes beast - surfaces in the last decades of his life, a time of self-imposed isolation from society. In a fascinating literalization of Fiedlers racial paradigm, Homers biography reveals that the only 76 companion he allowed himself in his solitude was Lewis Wright, a Black manservant. Although such parallels between Homers biography and the deployment of Otherness in his painting are intriguing, the paucity of biographical documentation - itself a product of a ferocious privacy that bespeaks a sense of the self under attack- makes it unlikely that these links will ever be more than tantalizing hints. Certainly, no useful purpose is served in rejecting the possibility that "any sexually aberrant tendency"2 3 might have informed Homers interest in those defined as outside the dominant culture, and the processes by which such categories of difference are constructed. On the other hand, neither is it clear that circumstantial evidence about his life should lead to the conclusion that Homer was "gay," in the modern sense of sexual self-awareness. 24 Any attempt to account biographically for the centrality of the Other - and especially the sexual Other - in Homers art will have to take account of his mothers role as his primary painting instructor. Henrietta Homer was a talented watercolorist, refining her skills in that most feminine of pastimes in Victorian America so that her son could revolutionize its conventions. In the studio, Homer is said to have used a photograph of her to cover work in progress when visitors intruded.25 Most revealing, however, are images such as the watercolor, Blackboard (187 7), and prints, such as Copyists at the Louvre (1868), The Beach at Long Branch (1869), and Noon Recess (1873), m which Homer s signature is rendered as if it had been written by a depicted figure: significantly, the surrogate artist is female.26 The consistent embodiment of the artist s hand in a female figure suggests that the processes of art-making themselves became, for the female-trained Homer, associated with sexual Otherness, making the very act of painting a means to dissolve the boundaries between Self and Other. Textual confirmation for this theory remains</page><page sequence="10">Fig. io Winslow Homer, Artists Sketching in the White Mountains, 1868. Oil on panel. Portland Museum of Art, Gift of Charles Shipman Pay son. unforthcoming, since Homer left to posterity no theoretical statement of the purposes or nature of his painting. But two early images of male artists at work - neither of them signed by their depicted figures - reinforce the sense that, for Homer, art became a means of engagement with the Other. In the two images, a painting and a related print, the featured artist is seen from behind so as to obscure his face. Despite this avoidance of direct self- portraiture, however, an auto-referential intent is evidenced by the hint of the mustachios Homer sported and by a foregrounded satchel stamped with his name. In the painted version, Artists Sketching in the White Mountains (1868; Fig. 10) Homer establishes a condition of opposition between the row of painters strung along in an even chain that implies the viewer as its logical last link, and the landscape they methodically survey. The painters, lined up on a hill that, to judge from the blasted stumps around them, has been deforested by men, turn their attention to an apparently unspoiled rich green promontory rising across the valley from them. Art here is shown as the engagement of one realm - rational, methodical, man-made, and masculine - with its corresponding Other. In The Artist in the Country, the 1869 wood engraving based on the oil, the explicitly female element in the equation emerges all the more forcefully for its absence in the painting. In contrast to typical presentations of women as the passive accessory of dashing plein-air artists, Homers now solitary male painter is towered over by a woman who, although slightly stooped to 77 inspect his work, rises even above the height of his parasol. The looming female figure, arching over the diminutive form of the seated artist, reinforces the association of overwhelming female power with the act of painting in Homers work. This idea, that to paint is to enter the realm of the Other, provides the connection between Homers various motifs of Otherness and his lifelong dedication to his craft. A series of pictures of waves breaking on the shore, painted in the last years of his career, brings the themes of woman and ocean as Other together with the Otherness of art. Some, such as Sunlight on the Coast (1890; Toledo Museum of Art) and West Point, Prouts Neck, Maine (1900; Clark Art Institute), take just a wave as their subject, the configurations of water and spray conforming eerily with Homer's earlier compositions of monumental fishing women. 2? If the waves in these late works can be read as women, however, they can even more easily be seen purely as paint: thick rivulets and bursts of white flecks over richly colored blues and greens, which for the modern viewer seem to anticipate in concentrated form the exuberance of Abstract Expressionism. Alongside these images of crashing breakers, stand pictures like Below Zero, in which the subject is not so much the wave/paint/woman, as the act of seeing such an image.28 Sight, in Homers</page><page sequence="11">painting, had long been privileged as the channel of interaction between Others; I have already noted the parallel between the woodsmen staring at the spray in Below Zero and the sexual dynamic of Enchanted. In these late pictures of figures staring at a burst of spray, however, Homer extends the paradigm of looking at the Other to include the viewers gaze at the canvas. Positioned behind the surrogate lookers in the painting, we are asked to share their gaze as they stare at ... at what? Initially, the waves read only as paint, patches of white pigment, roughly crosshatched. Even after the image has been resolved as a burst of spray, its exaggerated tactility draws attention to other passages of painterly complexity: in Below Zero the scratchy grass, the heavy daubing in the parkas, the brilliant turquoise underpainting beneath the dark waves of the sea, the creamy texture of the white that envelopes the figures' legs so that they leave no footprints, even the gut of the snowshoes picked out of wet paint with the back of the brush. Vibrating between a reading of the painting as an illusion and as an arrangement of variously textured pigments, viewers of these paintings- like the men and women in Homers earlier works who gazed at one another without touching - are confronted with something at once like them and their world (human forms, a grassy shore), yet fundamentally different (paint) in a relationship to the Other in which vision is the only connection. 29 Homers ultimate positioning of art itself in the place of the observed Other provides a fitting culmination to the consistent thematization of Otherness in his imagery. That he saw his profession as a means of engagement with the Other finds its most profound confirmation in his lifelong self-identification with the mariners he lived among, and took such care in painting. In his own terms, Homer is a hero on the model of the fishermen or rescue workers he depicted toiling to pull some kind of catch - whether fish or victim - from the sometimes dangerous, sometimes beautiful, always alien sea. Like them, Homer, when he painted, ventured into the realm of the Other, and his paintings are the trophys of that engagement. An early version of this article was presented at the 1987 Symposium on the History of Art at The Frick Collection, New York. I would like to thank Jules Prown for sparking my initial interest in, and nurturing my sustained consideration of, Winslow Homers art. Notes 1 On the philosophical genesis of the concept of Otherness, see Michael Theunissen, The Other: Studies in the Social Ontology of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and Buber, trans. Christopher Macann (Cambridge: mit Press, 1984). The psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan extends this genealogy in determining the general use of the term in contemporary criticism; see note 29. Despite transitory inflections from various of these theories, however, the use of Otherness throughout this essay concerns its mutually formative relationship to the Self, an analysis rooted in the processes of definition described by Ferdinand de Saussure in his Course in General Linguistics, trans.

Blueboy (November 1986), 54ff. 25 Henry Adams, "Mortal Themes: Winslow Homer," Art in America (February 1983), 117. 26 These early examples of the signature linked to the depicted Other anticipate its later appearance in works like Turtle Pound and Fox Hunt. In the watercolor Taking a Sunflower to the Teacher (1875 ; Georgia Museum of Art) Homer has initialed the slate belonging to the Black pupil. Whether the inference is that the youth or the teacher made the marks is unclear. 27 The diagonal composition punctuated by a billowy vertical form in Sunlight on the Coast might be compared with Inside the Bar; the S-shaped wave in West Point echoes the twisted nets around the shoulders of the figures in A Light on the Sea (1897; Corcoran Gallery of Art). 28 One early isolated watercolor, Boy on the Rocks, also takes up this theme. Its date has been incorrectly published as '"67" in The Canajoharie Library and Art Gallery: The Permanent Collection, when in fact it is "187" with the last digit cropped off. Helen Cooper suggests that it is a study executed when Homer was first experimenting with the physical properties of watercolor in Gloucester in 1873. The gritty opacity of the white gouache used by watercolorists to put highlights over translucent watercolor, seems immediately to have suggested to Homer the possibility of rendering ocean spray with a burst of roughly applied paint. This technique, born of Homers earliest exploration of innovative uses of watercolor, remained unexploited until the oils of the 1890S, although it is hinted at in a chalk and charcoal drawing of Cannon Rock dated to soon after Homers arrival in Maine in 1882. Cannon Rock is one of the subjects of Homers oil paintings from the following decade. See Margaret R. Burke, ed., Bowdoin College Museum of Art: Handbook of the Collection (Bowdoin College, 1 981), 138-40. 29 Homers privileging of sight in the mediation between Self and Other might be seen as a provocative anticipation of the psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan, which give vision a central role in both the infants first awareness of the Self ("The Mirror Stage," Ecrits [New York: W W Norton, 1977}), and the adults ongoing renegotiation of the relationship to the Other, through the parallel workings of desire and the gaze {The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho- Analysis [New York: WW Norton, 1977}).
