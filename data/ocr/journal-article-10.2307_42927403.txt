MCCARTHY* The interested sification small number of in stone establishing of implements young sound and active and methodological for archaeologists the analysis criteria working of stratified for the in Australia description assemblages are and intensely so clas- that interested in establishing sound methodological criteria for the description and clas- sification of stone implements and for the analysis of stratified assemblages so that they may break away from the time-honored systems of Europe. These archaeologists are loath to name their assemblages and prefer to compare the traits in each layer of their sites ; they want to discard the side, side and end, double side, end, etc., subdivision of scrapers, and lump them all together, comparing groups of them by dimensions, weight, length, and angle of trimmed edge and platform. They are examining the reasons for culture change - evolutionary, diffusional, environmental, or human - in sites ; and they are investigating the ecological setting and the geographical variations of assemblages throughout the continent. Some of these methodological criteria can be determined through more expeditious publi- cation of the results of fieldwork; one cause for delay, of course, is the uncertainty of inter- preting the finds of this pioneering and stimulating period of Australian prehistory. In this review, I shall comment on the main archaeological developments that have been published in the last two and one-half years. I concluded (19640), as a result of the excavation of five sites in the Capertee Valley of eastern New South Wales, that the Capertian and Bondaian phases of my Eastern Regional Sequence illustrate the history of stone working in this area from an early period (7360-3600 b.p.) of primary flakes, saws, and uniface pebble choppers to a later period (3600-900 b.p.) of elegant bondi points, microlithic implements, hafted specialized and unspecialized tool types, and ground-edge axes. I linked the Capertian with the Gambieran flint industry (Tindale's Tartangan c) in the Coorong of South Austra- lia, distinguished the trimmed nose and a few long-edged side scrapers as Tasmanoid af- finities in the Capertian, and drew attention to the importance of diffused traits in the Bondaian phase. A complementary paper by Walker (1964), is the first soil analysis in Australia of ar- chaeological sites and the soil bodies defined above support the Capertian and Bondaian phases. McBryde's (19640; 19650, b) findings at Seelands, Wombah, Bendemeer, and Whiteman's Creek on the north coast of New South Wales, Megaw's (1965, 19660, b) findings at Curracurrang, and other unpublished sites confirm the validity of the Capertian and Bondaian phases, but as yet only one further Eloueran phase assemblage has been found, at Curracurrang by Megaw, who thinks the Eloueran phase needs further definition. Megaw (1966 b) excavated fishhook files for the first time at Gymea Bay, New South Wales, and * Principal, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra City.</page><page sequence="2">138 Asian Perspectives , x, 1967 stated that the available evidence about the bone points, muduks , supports the theory that they were used as spear barbs and points - some as nose ornaments - but Megaw does not confirm the claim that they were fish-gorges or toggles. Mulvaney and Joyce (1965), in describing the Kenniff and The Tombs excavations in eastern Queensland, proposed solutions to some of the Australian problems: the authors divided the assemblages into a long non-hafted period of 1 1,000 years of hand-held scrapers, in which the weight and size of wasted material showed variations of possible cultural signif- icance, and a hafted period in the upper 2 ft. of deposit from 4,000 years ago to modern times, in which geometric microliths, pirri uniface points, elouera , adze flakes, bondi points, tula chisels, a burin, millstones, and edge-ground axe flakes occur with large arapia blocks, juan knives, and blade and slice implements. Mulvaney and Joyce subdivided the hafted period into microlithic hafted and late hafted because the microliths disappeared abruptly; they cited the Katherine, Kintore, and Ingaladdi sites in the Northern Territory, Laura in Cape York, Seelands, Curracurrang, Capertee, and Noola in New South Wales to support their hafted and non-hafted divisions. Cultural labeling was eschewed in favor of assessing man's exploitation of, and his ecological adaptations to, his environment in the light of technological factors. A remarkable feature of the Kenniff and The Tombs sites is the correlation of their non-occupation for 5,000 years with a similar long period of aridity. Mulvaney and Joyce stressed the importance of local manifestations in the composition of the implement range of both eras both at Kenniff and The Tombs and elsewhere in Australia, and they withdrew a former claim for Tasmanian affinities in the non-hafted assemblages. The attempt to avoid naming assemblages is a worthy one and the two major divisions - hafted and non-hafted - will, if substantiated in the future, be of basic importance in Austra- lian prehistory. But the very variety of assemblages in each of these moieties, as it were, will necessitate local terms or site names to distinguish them, and where more than one site (as Kenniff and The Tombs) contain similar assemblages, difficulties of comparison will occur. My own explanation for the varying proportions of similar widespread ranges of implement types in the hafted and non-hafted periods, particularly in the former, is differential diffu- sion in time and space on the vast continent of Australia: there were no serious barriers to diffusion except for the Great Dividing Range in the east, and there was an intricate network of local and trunk trade routes. I believe the mixing of implement traits in marginal areas in the hafted periods of the Eastern Sequence and the Inland Regional Sequence supports this claim. Megaw (19660), in a preliminary review, stated that his Curracurrang excavation revealed a tripartite division comparable to my Capertian-Bondaian-Eloueran sequence, and he added the fishhook file to the range of implements of this sequence; he rejected Tindale's attempt to include the Bondaian phase within his Mudukian, finding support for the former phase in the Seelands, Wombah, and Whiteman's Creek sites that McBryde excavated in northern New South Wales. Excavations in eastern New South Wales, therefore, support the validity of the Eastern Regional Sequence and, in my view, the hypothesis that sites like Kenniff are marginal with a predominant basis of Tula Inland Sequence implements mixed with Eastern Sequence types; at the same time, the eastern New South Wales sites provide solid support for Mulvaney's non-hafted and hafted divivisions of Australian prehistoric in- dustries. Four reviews of Australian prehistory were published in this 1964-1966 period by Golson (1964), Mulvaney (19640), Micha (1965), and me (19650, 1966/). Widely recognized in the reviews are the Eastern and Tula Inland Regional sequences and, possibly, a third northern</page><page sequence="3">McCarthy: Australia 139 one, although Golson believes that the sharp division between the Capertian, on the one hand, and the Bondaian-Eloueran, on the other, needs further study to ascertain whether the break was as abrupt as it appears to be from the present evidence. Similarly, the Kartan and the Gambieran phases need more detailed research to establish their distinguishing features and provenance. The Tartangan is rejected generally as a cultural term apart from the type site. It appears to me, therefore, that with the dropping of the Tartangan and the Mudukian phases, the phases of the Tula Inland Sequence are thus tending to become Gambieran, Pirrian, and Murundian. Golson emphasized the need to study implement-type frequencies in all sites and to judge cultures in terms of total characteristics or assemblages, not by the absence or presence of one or two implement types. Golson's reanalysis of the material from the Oenpelli sites excavated in 1948 by Setzler and me revealed the existence of two assem- blages - point and elouera - and not one, as we reported. Golson, too, reiterated the vital importance of the geometrical microliths in Australian sequences and the need to ascertain their precise distribution on the continent; they are absent in northern Australia. All pre- historians recognize the difficulty in explaining the ambiguity and inconsistencies in the occurrence of uniface pebble tools, backed blades, and microliths in the Eastern and Tula Sequences, but to my mind the principal factor is differential diffusion and the time involved in tribal acceptance and development of implement types. Micha's (1965) paper revealed that European anthropologists are at last becoming aware of the prehistoric cultural situation in Australia and of the great number of problems yet to be resolved. Micha drew attention to the unexpectedly early appearance of the saw-edge at Capertee, to the important part played by the culture heroes in spreading new ideas in aboriginal culture, and to the support that radiocarbon dates are giving to the estimated length of time Capell and O' Grady believe was necessary for Australian languages to develop and diverge so greatly. Mulvaney (1964a) and I (1965a, 1966/) restated the Capell-O' Grady views on Australian prehistory, and I postulated that an early, a middle, and a late stone age existed on the continent. Several unusual discoveries were made in excavations. Mulvaney, Lawton, and Twidale (1964) revealed a 2-in. band of flood deposit between i220±94 b.c. and iooo±9i b.c., some 23.5 ft. above river level in Fromm's Landing No. 6 site on the lower Murray River of South Australia. It is the highest level for this river yet recorded and obviously indicates a period of heavy rainfall. The site yielded a Thylacine tooth and is notable for the absence of pirri uniface points. Megaw (1966 b) reported stake holes for the first time in an excavation in Australia in his Gymea Bay site. At Curracurrang, he found considerable disruption of the deposit caused by the excavation of a large portion of it by the aboriginal occupants in an effort to improve the site for habitation. Metrical analysis has become the principal method of evaluating stratified cultural assem- blages, and to date Tugby has employed the matrix-analysis method for axes; Mulvaney (1965) used a metrical analysis of "scrapers" and waste flakes from Kenniff and The Tombs; and Glover (1965), a factor analysis of Bondaian implements from Curracurrang. A satis- factory method of metrical analysis, based upon the same set of criteria and applied to all Australian assemblages, would yield most interesting comparative results, but the methods in use are too diverse as yet. It is essential for the characteristics of Australian implement types to be or not to be substantiated by such a method, but whether metrical methods can establish a system of classification has yet to be proved. Glover, in a University of Sydney thesis (1965), employed the factor analysis method to classify 96 Bondaian-phase implements from Megaw's Curracurrang site; as a result, he confirmed the validity of the elouera as a</page><page sequence="4">140 Asian Perspectives , x, 1967 distinct type. Although he rejected the traditional classification of geometrical microliths according to shape {bondi point, crescents, trapezoids, triangles) in favor of the term backed blades, he suggested no substitute for this useful terminology in such widespread use. Matthews (1966) concluded from metrical analysis that Kangaroo Island pebble tools differ from Yamba and Seelands (New South Wales) and Sai Yok (Thailand) samples in all variables examined, and the latter three differ in weights. The Kangaroo Island and Wakefield River (South Australia) samples are similar in weight and are heavier than the other three samples that have comparable mean weights. Matthews thinks the differences are probably the result of function or method of use. The Yamba and Seelands samples have a similar cutting angle and length-breadth ratio, and the Yamba, Seelands, and Sai Yok samples have comparable thickness. Matthews believes the inference is that the uniface pebble tools from Kangaroo Island are not to be related to those from Yamba, Seelands, or Sai Yok; the Seelands and Yamba implements are more closely related to each other than either is with Sai Yok, and the Seelands and Sai Yok assemblages are further related by truncated tools and similar configura- tions of the junction of the upper and lower face. Matthews concluded that caution should be exercised in any attempt to see historical relationships between these three samples of pebble tools because they are removed from their natural setting: sources of material and the environment of the makers were not examined, and their ages are not known. Two very important papers appeared by Tindale (1965) and Thomson (1964) in which firsthand observations on the manufacture and hafting of stone implements and their use in making wooden weapons were described. Tindale witnessed the making of tjimari knives at Mount Davies, South Australia, and of kandi tjuna chisels and kandi mirnu knives with gum grips at Mount Gill, Rawlinson Ranges, Western Australia. The kandi tjuna flakes were select- ed by the Nakako tribesmen from their knapped pieces, hafted in gum on a handle, and edge- trimmed after mounting (not before, as with the tula chisel). Constant use and retrimming, he stated, produced the burren slug; thus, a cultural and geographical differentiation was established between the Western Desert tribes and the Central Australian tribes whose tula chisel produces a different slug. Both slug types, however, occur on western New South Wales and Queensland sites and, in my view, the point is not yet proved that both could not have been derived from the tula chisel alone. The burren slug, in fact, appears to have a wider and more important connotation in eastern Australia from the Murray River to Cape York, and its origin within the industries of this region needs detailed study. Tindale described tooth trimming of knives and Kimberley biface points, and edge-trimming with a stick or boomer- ang by the Ngadadjara in the Warburton Ranges. Thomson (1964) also described the manufacture of weapons with one-and two-handed choppers and hand axes, heavy scrapers, hafted chisels, and similar methods of trimming to those observed by Tindale. The chisel was trimmed by biting after mounting, and he said that it is a different implement to the central Australian hafted chisel ( tula). His observations of stone-implement manufacture were made in the Western Desert and, with Tindale's, constitute vitally important firsthand observations on our knowledge of aboriginal techni- ques. North (1964) proposed the name Moonee adze for truncated uniface pebble implements with a straight-end working edge, and Johnson (1964) proposed the term wardulka pick for a distinctive pointed implement made on coroids and blocks and tjunggani for the roller-type muller - both collected on the Pitjandjara tableland in northwestern South Australia; there, Johnson defined the Tollu industry on old campsites associated with terra rossa soils and</page><page sequence="5">McCarthy: Australia 141 kunkarized dunes and newer campsites on recent dunes; the campsites range in age from Pleistocene to recent. Macintosh (1965 b) reviewed current opinions on aboriginal man in Australia: his relation- ships with Southeast Asian finds, the trihybrid theory, his likeness to Homo solensis , and his migration routes across sea passages. Macintosh placed the Mossgiel skull between Talgai, Cohuna, and Homo solensis ; he rejected Tindale's claim that the Tartangan skull is Tas- manoid, and commented that the indeterminable racial affinity of the Aitape frontal bones and others make it a dangerous item for speculative theorizing about aboriginal migration. Recent investigations by Gill and Macintosh will, it is anticipated, produce a radiocarbon date for Talgai, morphologically still the most primitive of fossil Australian crania. The differences, however, according to Macintosh, between fossil and modern skulls in Australia is not great. In a valuable and most complete assessment of material on the physical anthropology of the Tasmanians, Macintosh and Barker (1965) stated that the Tasmanians, if not pygmoid, were of less stature than the Australians, and the authors vizualize the cranium as a hybridized version of deviating types derived from a common racial stem and anticipate that if early crania are excavated in Tasmania, they will not be precisely similar to present-day Tasmanians or Australians. Macintosh and Barker believe that the skull form of the Tasmanians is well established - there is good general agreement on observed similarities and differences - and that it is now unreasonable to doubt that they walked into Tasmania from Australia on a land corridor that existed 12,000 years ago from northeast Tasmania to Wilson's Promono- tory in Victoria. Jones (1964, 1965#) carried out two seasons of fieldwork in Tasmania with the aim of iso- lating total industries and of investigating the ecological and geographical variations and adap- tations within the island. Rich yields of stone and bone implements and of faunal remains were obtained ; the notable discoveries were of human cremations through the 7-ft. deep deposit at West Point and of the first stone arrangement (1965 b) in Tasmania - a row 270 ft. long of 138 flat stones arranged as a pathway on a midden, with a second one below it, at the Bay of Fires. He discovered also that two rock-shelter deposits at Rocky Cape are correlated with changes in sea level. Yamaguchi (1966) examined collections of skeletal material in Australian universities and museums and defined three types of crania - Australian, Intermediate, and Ainoid - and he discovered an artificial enlargement of the foramen magnum in both Ainu and Australian skulls. Some interesting evidence about the dingo has been presented. Meggitt (1965), in sum- marizing the evidence on the use of the dingo by the Aborigines, concluded that Down's hypothesis that a relationship of mutual exploitation developed between mesolithic hunters and wild dogs becomes plausible in that such a relationship existed between the aborigines and the dingo. According to Meggitt, this animal was not very useful to the aborigines; the tame one was not an effective hunting dog except in ecologically specialized regions where particular kinds of game were present. The hunters allowed dingoes to hunt down game, which the hunters ate, giving the scraps to the dingoes. Dingo teeth were excavated by McCarthy (1965a) in Site 3 at Capertee with an age of just over 3,000 years; a complete dingo skeleton was discovered in Fromm's Landing No. 6 by Mulvaney, Lawton, and Twidale (1964) with an age of 3,000 years; and unspecified remains were found in Levels 6 and 8 at Mount Burr, South Australia, by Campbell and Hossfeld with an age of 7,000-8,000 years - the oldest stratified remains associated with human (Gambieran?) implements yet recovered.</page><page sequence="6">142 Asian Perspectives , x, 1967 An immense amount of photographic and scale recording of rock art is being done in all of the major areas on the continent. The Western Australian Museum is making a detailed photographic survey of the Kimberley Wandjina and allied cave paintings, obtaining inter- pretations where possible; for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Robert Edwards is carrying out a similar survey of Arnhem Land and Northern Territory paintings; Trezise has produced a remarkable series of scale recordings of Cape York paintings; Mountford and Edwards have recorded sites in the rain-forest region of northeastern Queensland; and Sim is carrying out a program of recording of the little-known but numerous sites in the Sydney- Hawkesbury area of New South Wales. From radiocarbon samples, Macintosh (1965) established the age of a group of ritual paintings in this area at about A.D. 1400 and nearby paintings A.D. 1750-1800, while McBryde obtained dates of A.D. 930-1000 for paintings at Bendemeer, New South Wales. McBryde noted a strong difference between the linear art of the tableland area and the stencilled art of the north coast of New South Wales. The recording of rock engravings has not been so intensive : B.J. Wright ( 1 964) has described some sites in a survey that he has made of northwestern Australian sites; Edwards (19640, ¿ ; 1965 ají) and Mountford and Edwards (1964) recorded several sites in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia; Sim (1965) found others in the Sydney-Hawkesbury area where over 90 per- cent of the one thousand or so sites have now been recorded; and McBryde (1964^) dis- covered sites in northeastern New South Wales in which tally grooves are predominant. Mountford (1965a) classified northwestern Australian engravings on weathered rock surfaces as poundings and those in the south-central Australian region as peckings; this regional di- chotomy will probably not be substantiated, as the former series is merely a regional variation, of the pecked or hammerdressed intaglio technique as a whole. Crawford (1964) questioned the four phases of rock engravings in Australia that I defined in 1962 on grounds that he cannot distinguish the superposition of one style over another; but conclusive evidence from South Australian and western New South Wales sites supporting pecked over linear phases is now abundant. The most difficult problem is to relate the Carvarvon, Queens- land, style to the western and southern sequences. Mountford's and Edward's claim (1962) that an outline fish, a marine turtle, and crocodile figures engraved in the Flinders Range, South Australia, sites was attacked by me (1964Í) on the grounds that the very ancient origin claimed for these three figures is inconsistent with the history and development of rock engravings in Australia, that they are in three strongly contrasting styles that are consistent with the above four phases in rock engravings, that fish have been painted and engraved a long way from the sea in other parts of Australia, and the so-called marine turtle is a long- necked freshwater tortoise. Although the floors of rock-shelters excavated in various places have yielded pigments, few correlations can be made, as yet, between the styles of paintings on the walls and roofs and the cultural assemblages. The three-phase stone industry sequence and the four-phase cave art sequence in eastern New South Wales offer possibilities of correlation in the future. A correlation of similar motifs in rock engravings and paintings occurs in the Sydney-Haw- kesbury area and other areas in Australia, but no overall study has yet been made of similarities and differences. Golson (1964) contended that the typological approach is the only approach to the study of the vast array of this art on the continent with the addition of the meanings of motifs whenever they can be obtained. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies is compiling a catalogue of museum holdings throughout the world of Australian aboriginal artifacts of all kinds, and preliminary results</page><page sequence="7">McCarthy: Australia 143 (McCarthy 1966) indicate that Great Britain, Europe, the United States, and New Zealand museums contain important collections, while in Africa, Central America, South America, and Asia, the collections are very limited. A one-day conference of prehistorians during the General Meeting of the Australian In- stitute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra, May 1966, discussed the nomenclature of stone implements and cultures and the need for a standard nomenclature of rock art in Australia. Papers given by various contributors are to be incorporated in a handbook on Australian archaeological field methods. At Hobart in August 1965, Section F held a symposium on progress in Australian archaeology with papers by I. McBryde, R.J. Lampert, N.B. Tindale, R.M. Jones, and J.V.S. Megaw. A second symposium on theTasmanian aborigines included papers by W.F. Ellis, N.J.B. Plomley, G. Reber, and R.M. Jones that are to be published by the Queen Victoria Museum. A new journal, Archaeology and Physical Anthropology in Oceania , has been issued by the University of Sydney to provide an avenue of publication for the growing number of papers and reports in archaeology and physical anthropology. Similarly, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies provides for the publication of monographic studies in its Occasional Papers . Radiocarbon Dates (B.P.)

This trend (McCarthy 1966) indicates that man migrated across the plains of the interior where there were no real barriers to his advance, instead of moving steadily- down the east coast; the oldest east coast dates are from Curracurrang and Seelands. The assemblages from coastal sites also tend to suggest that man penetrated the great Range from the west at different points and, as a result, preserved archaic stone industries in various coastal areas.

This very important review of Australian prehistory refers to early and modern research, the antiquity of man as revealed by excavations at Cape Martin (South Australia), Keilor (Victoria), KennifF (Queensland), Noola, Capertee, and Menindee (New South Wales); discusses the Gam- bieran and Kartan and the problem of pebble tools and their affinities; the lower Murray River sites and their nomenclature; the marginal overlap of microlithic and point industries; the nor- thern Australian assemblages; the Tule Inland and Eastern Regional Sequences, problems of correlation in South Australia and eastern Australia; recent recordings of rock art sites ; McCarthy's four stages of rock art in Australia; present opinion and ancient crania - Talgai, Cohuna, Keilor, Mossgiel, Tartanga - and their relationships; Weidenreich's theory; the tri-hybrid theory; Abbie's views, Plomley's réévaluation of Tasmanian material in Europe; man and the extinct vertebrates and evidence for association; environment and ecology; Tindale's tribal and campsite maps. Golson's comments and assessments on many of the above matters highlight the nature of the problems involved and his own views on them. Green, J. H., J. Hamis, J.W.G. Neuhauss, D.K.B. Sewell, and M.
