This paper describes briefly its impact on the island of Jamaica, focussing on both the physical environment and national economy. The population invested the hurricane with a person ality. Anthropomorphism is seen as aform of cognitive dissonance, and humour is singled out as a key psychological prop in this social context in helping relieve the anxiety and stress created in the wake of the disaster. A few weeks after Hurricane Gilbert struck Jamaica, on 12 September 1988, Lovindeer, one of the country's leading dance hall DJs, released a single called ' Wild Gilbert'. It was the fastest selling reggae record in the history of Jamaican music. Its enormous appeal lay in its lyrics, an apposite and witty social commentary on Gilbert's rampage and its aftermath. Hurricane Gilbert, the most fearsome and devastating hurricane to develop in the western hemisphere on record, in a relatively short space of time, had become a person and not an event in the psyche of a nation. This paper documents some of the impressive parameters of hurricane Gilbert and summarises briefly its main impact on the Jamaican environment and economy, and on people's lives. The nation helped to cope with this terrifying event by imbuing it with a personality. An incomprehensible trauma was given a social context so that experi ences and incidents associated with Gilbert could be invested with humour, a crucial psychological coping mechanism in dealing with personal disaster and misfortune. Parameters of hurricane Gilbert Eyre (1989) has commented on Gilbert's remarkably rapid intensification from its genesis, 200 miles east of Barbados on 10 September 1988, and its equally fast forward movement of around 15 to 17 mph. The track of the hurricane across the Caribbean is shown in Figure 1. The storm made its first landfall on the east coast ofJamaica at 10.00 am (EST)' on Monday, 12 September, and its track also took it across the Yucatan, and the Gulf of Mexico, to make landfall again on the Mexican coast at the fishing village of La Pesca. As it moved inland, into the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains south of Monterey, it was finally downgraded to a tropical depression. Shortly after the eye exited Jamaica, the hurricane intensified further to 888 mb, the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western hemisphere. A regional view of the weather system associated with the tropical cyclone was quite spectacular. Satellite imagery taken at the time the system was over Jamaica depicts spiral rainbands extend ing from the west coast of Mexico to eastern Venezuela, and from central Florida to northern Ecuador (Eyre 1989). The same author reports that the system was so powerful that the ITCZ was temporarily eliminated. Before Gilbert made landfall in Jamaica, close to Morant Point, radar imagery at the Norman Manley International Airport, Kingston, revealed that the hurricane had a</page><page sequence="2">108 Barker and Miller 100 go0 80 a Tropical Depression 5am EST 9th September b Tropical Storm Gilbert 5am EST 10th September C Hurricane Gilbert Category 1 9.30pm EST 10th Sept. d Hurricane Watch 5am EST ltth September 30 e Hurricane Category 2 11am EST tlth September f Hurricane Warning 3pm EST 11th September g Hurricane Category 3 10pm EST 11th September 4 6 k at 0~ h Hurricane Category 4 10am EST 12th September 0 Mont roY GULF OF MEXICO ')} !

As the eye began its passage over the eastern parishes it was estimated to be approximately 15 miles across before the land based radar became inoperative. Airborne radar data indicated that the eye was still approximately 12 miles in diameter as it exited the country somewhere in the vicinity of Negril. Figure 2 attempts to reconstruct the path of the eye across Jamaica. The hurricane's speed was such that it took only nine hours to travel across the spine of the island, a distance exceeding 150 miles. Gilbert appears to be the only hurricane in Jamaica's recorded history to have travelled the whole length of the country. Unlike hurricane Charlie in 1951, Jamaica's last experience of a direct hit, hurricane Gilbert's rampage across the island was virtually entirely a daytime phenomenon. The eye passed directly over the capital Kingston, and second largest urban centre, Spanish Town, around lunchtime. These urban centres have a combined population of 0 75 million out of a national population of 2 3 million. As it passed over Kingston, a pressure of 964 mb and a wind speed of 131 mph were recorded. The eye also passed over densely populated rural parishes and other small towns, so that a large proportion of the population witnessed the entire sequence of events associated with the passage of a hurricane. Thus, the ferocity of the winds, the sheer size of the eye, which produced a period of respite lasting for 50 minutes for Kingstonians and others living near to the central axis of the eye, plus the fact that it all happened in daylight, contributed to a vivid, harrowing and unforgettable experience for a significant proportion of the country's population.</page><page sequence="3">Hurricane Gilbert 109 N 0 c 20O Figure 2 The track of the eye of hurrIcane Gilbert across Jamaica m Track of eye 0 12 B Figure 2 The track of the eye of hurricane Gilbert across Jamaica Impact on the physical environment Prior to the onslaught of hurricane Gilbert, many of the watersheds across Jamaica, and especially in the steeply sloping highly dissected terrain of the Blue Mountains, were in a badly degraded condition due to accelerated erosion as a consequence of both histori cal and contemporary agricultural malpractice (Eyre 1987; Barker and McGregor 1988). As a result, the potential damaging effects of Gilbert were maximised because the environment was already in a fragile state. Hurricane Gilbert wreaked havoc on the Jamaican environment chiefly because of its high wind speeds and associated rainfall. Average windspeeds of 75 mph gusting to 127 mph were recorded in Kingston which intensified to 77 mph with gusts to 131 mph after the immediate passage of the eye. Wind speeds were maintained as the hurricane tracked across the island, average speeds of 83 mph gusting to 138 mph being recorded at Montego Bay. Along the north and east coasts winds were probably stronger as they swept inland off the sea. A severe loss of both natural and planted tree and shrub cover occurred. Many trees were either badly damaged or uprooted especially in those areas affected by the passage of the eye where the winds were most destructive. Elsewhere, broken branches and defoliation was the norm. An estimated2 5,000 acres (15 per cent) of Pinus caribaea plantation and a further 2,000 acres (17 per cent) of planted hardwoods were severely damaged particularly on the flanks of the Blue Mountains, a feature of their exposure. An additional 4,750 acres were defoliated whilst an estimated 60,000 acres (32 per cent) of natural forest also suffered damage islandwide. Eyre (1989) indicates that hurricane Gilbert was one of the wettest synoptic systems experienced in modern times, but more than 95 per cent of its generated precipitation fell on the sea. Consequently, rainfall associated with the hurricane was much lower than Jamaica had experienced during the devastating flood rains of June 1986 and November 1987, the reason being the fairly rapid progress of the system across the island. Between 8-10 inches (200-250 mm) of precipitation fell on 12 September, increas ing to 12-14 inches (300-350 mm) in the Blue Mountains and up to 16 inches</page><page sequence="4">110 Barker and Miller (400 mm) in the west central districts. Accumulated rainfall totals for the period 10-15 September averaged 12 inches (300 mm) with peaks of 20-36 inches (500-900 mm) on the higher ground. A major feature of the rainfall on the day of the hurricane was not its intensity or amount, but that most fell between 1300-1900 hours (EST) after the tree cover had been defoliated and uprooted. Much of the rainfall which would otherwise have been intercepted by a dense tree cover infiltrated into the largely unprotected surface soil which became rapidly and thoroughly wetted and both its field and infil tration capacity exceeded. Raindrop impact, surface wash and attendant soil erosion was also widespread in areas of uprooted trees. Rainfall triggered landsliding occurred on an unprecedented scale in the days and weeks following the hurricane, chiefly in the form of rapid shallow translational slides and debris flows in weathered materials. The main areas affected were the Blue Mountains and the east and west central districts of the island; manifesting itself in the disruption of the road network and the loss of agricultural land. Indeed some of the effects of landsliding can be gained by reference to the provisional estimates of road repair costs which amounts to US$19-3 million, the bulk of which can be attributed to rainfall induced slope failure and surface runoff. In the aftermath of hurricane Gilbert, many rivers and gullies experienced high peak bankfull and overbank discharges which resulted in the destruction of bunds and groynes estimated at US$5 6 million. The high suspended sediment loads experienced led to siltation of some gullies and localised flooding. One of the less impressive parameters of hurricane Gilbert was the absence of a significant storm surge. The combined surge and seaswell on the east and north coasts was 7-6 m diminishing to 3 m on the south coast. Only between Morant Point and Hector's River did a significant surge occur (Eyre 1989). The main erosive agent was wave action which damaged coastal and sea defences estimated at US$3 8 million mainly on the north and north-east coasts. Temporary beach erosion was widespread, predominantly on the north, east and south-east coasts. Impact on the economy The most recent Government estimates and those by the insurance industry put total damage somewhere between US$800 million and US$1000 million, whilst estimates of reinsurance inflows into Jamaica are US$650 million. To put these damage costs into perspective, even the lower value exceeds the country's annual foreign exchange earn ings from exports. Further, the impact of hurricane Gilbert has inevitably affected economic growth. After longer than a decade of economic decline and stagnation, the economy had started to revive, growing at 3 6 per cent and 5-4 per cent in the fiscal year 1986/87 and 1987/88. The projected growth rate for 1988/89 had been 4.5 per cent, but it turned out eventually to be much lower than this, at 0-6 per cent. No sector of the economy escaped disruption and damage to physical plant, but agriculture fared much worse than the manufacturing sector. Provisional estimates for damage to domestic food crops have been put at US$63 million in loss of income, and US$27 million in replanting costs. The local poultry industry, a major source of protein for the urban poor and rich alike, was virtually wiped out. The shortfall in domestic food production, of course, has to be met by food imports in an already import-dependent, and highly indebted economy. Official statistics on loss of income obscure the fact that most of the rural population grows its own food, and suffered not only crop losses in fields, but substantial damage to food trees in kitchen gardens. In the short term, at least, food aid and distribution became an important item on the political agenda.</page><page sequence="5">Hurricane Gilbert 111 Table 1 Damage estimates to export crops resulting from hurricane Gilbert Foreign Acreage exchange loss prior to Acreage % Acreage US$m Gilbert damaged damaged (1988/89) Sugar 100,000 30,000 30 0 0.0 Banana 7,100 7,000 98 5 10 0 Cocoa 27,500 26,000 94-5 1.0 Coffee 28,000 15,000 53 6 7 0 Pimento 16,000 8,000 50 0 2 5 Citrus 15,500 5,000 32 3 0 9 Ornamental horticulture 1,315 859 65 3 3-8 Orchard crops 1,802 557 309 1 5 Source: Planning Institute ofJamaica; compiled from data collected by Ministry of Agriculture, Commodity Boards and Agro 21 The data in Table 1 give an indication of the damage done to export agriculture. The banana crop was the worst affected, with virtually 100 per cent losses. It was also the crop which accounted for the largest loss in foreign exchange earnings, of some US$10*0 million, as a result of the hurricane. Many banana estates, like coconut plan tations are located in the badly affected eastern parishes. For example, the new hi-tech project established by Eastern Bananas (Barker 1985) is located in the vicinity of the point where the eye first made landfall, and thus suffered the full brunt of the hurricane. In terms of loss of foreign exchange earnings, the second most serious losses were in coffee. Over 70 per cent of the coffee grown in the Blue Mountains was destroyed. Coffee damage was not confined to the storm itself. We saw earlier that this upland area was subject to considerable landsliding in the weeks after the hurricane. In the last five years several new, large scale coffee projects utilising ill-advised monocropping prac tices on steep slopes, with extensive removal of tree cover have been established in the area. Thus the damage which occurred was to mature coffee bushes, and also to immature plants. A large joint venture project between the Jamaican Government and Japanese interests, at Shirley Castle and Claverty Cottage on the northern slopes of the Blue Mountains, will cost an estimated US$8 million for rehabilitation. Many of these newly planted coffee plants had not had sufficient time to bear fruit before the hurricane struck. The impact on people's lives The death toll of 45 in Jamaica was much smaller than the 330 reported deaths in Mexico. However, the short and medium term impact on people's lives was phenome nal. The most common, stressful problem was the physical loss or damage to roofing, and the consequent soaking and spoilage of furniture, fittings, electrical equipment and personal belongings. The number of people affected this way is not known, but it must be considerably more than the estimated 400,000 who evacuated their homes on the day of the storm. This statistic implies that as many as one person in five in Jamaica had to abandon their homes, temporarily at least. The evacuation lasted only about a</page><page sequence="6">112 Barker and Miller week for perhaps half these people. Over two thousand people remained homeless for several months after the event, and repairs to buildings continued for up to a year later. The serious national disruption of water and electricity supply was reflected in the damage estimates. Approximately 73 per cent of all damage costs to public utilities were incurred by the local power company, the Jamaica Public Service Company UPS). A further 9 per cent was attributed to the National Water Commission (NWC) and 8 5 per cent to the local telephone company. The widespread toppling of utility poles and damage to transmission lines meant that the JPS could only operate at half its capacity when it began to supply electricity again. The JPS estimated its own damage at US$78 million (excluding loss of revenue), of which US$55 million was needed just to restore transmission lines and utility poles. In a well-planned and rapidly executed programme, full electricity supplies were restored to the country by the end of November. Despite some assistance from line crews from the UK, USA and Canada, this was largely a Jamaican effort, and the JPS linemen working around the clock became the heroes of the hour. One of the most unusual aspects of the disaster, which has a bearing on our under standing of people's perception and cognition of natural hazards, was the rapid way in which the hurricane was anthropomorphised. Tuan (1979, 7) notes that the habit of anthropomorphising nature is deeply ingrained, although his discussion is focussed more on the historical perception of places and landscape rather than on specific natural events. Perhaps hurricanes are a special case in modern times since meteorological agencies tempt anthropomorphism by assigning personal names to identify such weather systems. The identification of tropical cyclones by personal names began officially in 195 13 (Dunn and Miller 1960), using the Able, Baker, Charlie phonetic alphabet. This system was revised two years later when all tropical cyclones were identified by female names.4 Gender bias in naming tropical storms was abandoned for the Atlantic5 in 1979. Now, the National Hurricane Center in Miami uses a six-year cycle, publishing an advance list of names by which storms are to be identified. Male and female names are alternated in alphabetical order, and the gender of the first name on the list is also alternated each year. If a tropical storm proves to be particularly destructive, its name is retired from the list and a replacement added. A name having been provided at birth, Gilbert quickly and spontaneously acquired a reputation as a rampaging badman, even harbouring aliases such as Kilbert, Rufus and Rambo, in the manner of notorious gunmen from Kingston's ghettos. However, it is not easy to speculate as to why the hurricane was anthropomorphised so quickly and readily, partly because there are no similar studies with which to make comparisons. One factor facilitating anthropomorphism was the sheer scale of the damage and its dramatic violence to the landscape. In the aftermath of the hurricane everyone was forced to perceive and confront a transformed environment. New landscapes had been created in just a few frightening hours. Utter disbelief and incredulity at the scale of the impact were almost universal perceptual responses to these new landscapes. The urban landscape had become a chaos of blocked roads, fallen trees, zinc sheeting, toppled utility poles and straggling transmission lines, wrecked buildings and an occasional crumpled satellite dish. Rural landscapes were seas of levelled trees and crops. Within two weeks, once familiar landscapes had changed yet again, to take on the weird appearance of a snowless winter in a temperate latitude. Trees and bushes had been totally defoliated, places seemed bare and empty and surprising new vistas and panoramas had appeared as if from nowhere.</page><page sequence="7">Hurricane Gilbert 113 Perhaps by anthropomorphiziiig the event the inability to comprehend such an awesome transformation of the landscape could be conveniently reduced to a more prosaic and simplistic cause ' Gilbert ' could be held responsible. Anthropomorphis ing a natural hazard may thus be a form of cognitive dissonance. Gilbert also provided a convenient scapegoat for all manner of social, economic and personal problems. In fact, a new temporal and social reference point was established, Before Gilbert (BG) and After Gilbert (AG), and the standard greetings for a while was ' How did Gilbert treat you? ' and ' Do you still have a roof ' Other factors which may have encouraged anthropomorphism are probably specifi cally bound up with Jamaican culture. Certainly in a society dominated by an aggress ive, male value system with a violent undercurrent, and the sometimes ambivalent attitudes towards what Jamaicans call ' being bad ', the persona of Gilbert was easily moulded. Further, the grammatical structure of Jamaican patois itself may have also played a role. For example, ' him ' is extensively used in the third person as a pronoun (Cassidy 1971, 53), irrespective of case and gender, and sometimes even in plural form as an alternative to ' dem '. Whether the anthropomorphism would have occurred had the hurricane been identified by a female name is not possible to assess. Interestingly, all the calamitous hurricanes of the last decade in the Caribbean have had male names, David and Frederick (1979), Allen (1980) and Gilbert (1988). Table 2 contains a sample of newspaper clippings which convey some of the idioms which were used by reporters and commentators. The anthropomorphism contained in these clippings is obvious, but note the use of humour even in the reporting of looting. In fact, stories about looting abounded and some felt that looters were the only ones to take disaster preparedness seriously. One of the most popular stories was about a supermarket being looted. A Mercedes pulled up outside the supermarket and the driver reportedly rushed inside and enquired whether there was any Johnny Walker Black left. Such stories spread like wild fire in the close-knit urban community of Kingston textbook examples of familiar contagious diffusion processes. Whether true or apocryphal, the functions of such stories and the many graphic, often entertain ingly related descriptions of personal experiences, were quite clear: to help relieve anxiety and stress by putting on a brave face and even poking fun at the uncontrollable sequence of events which had embraced everyone. Another illustration of humour was the way people referred to a subsequent tropical cyclone, hurricane Joan. The 1988 hurricane season produced eleven named tropical storms in the Caribbean, five of which became hurricanes. Hurricane Joan formed on 11 October, east of Barbados, and moved into the Caribbean, assuming a position off the north coast of Venezuela. Its track took it south of Jamaica as it hugged the south American coastline. In meteorological circles it achieved fame by doing something highly unusual; it flipped across Nicaragua into the Pacific, where it was renamed Miriam. In Jamaican circles it achieved notoriety as Gilbert's wife, searching for her husband. The initial apprehension in Jamaica about hurricane Joan's possible track, and whether it would strike the island, was well founded. In 1886 and in 1937 the country was affected by seven hurricanes in each of those years (Gray 1988). Table 3 shows the probability of more than one hurricane affecting Jamaica in a single year is 0-446. In this illustration too, humour can be thought of as a method of helping relieve anxiety. These comments on the use of humour are not meant to belittle the social impact of the physical devastation, nor to minimise the psychological trauma of despair which engulfed some individuals. Rather, to suggest that in this particular disaster at least, personifying a natural event and talking about it in a light-hearted way was an important psychological coping mechanism.</page><page sequence="8">114 Barker and Miller Table 2 Excerpts from newspaper reports and commentaries Last week we were visited by Gilbert. For close to 24 hours he raged and howled and pelted torrents of rain. The naive and the fool hardy looked forward to his arrival with some excitement. Others, more mature perhaps, viewed the impending onslaught with some trepidation. Some were caught completely unprepared. All of us however, had just about had enough of this unwelcome guest by the time he left. Daily Gleaner 20 September 1988 It all began when the more than 500 people living in the district started to move into the school with their belongings on Sunday even ing, September 11, 1988, in anticipation of Hurricane Gilbert. But even then, it was just as if no one could escape Gilbert, because as he lashed Portland, the school roof was the first to come off, followed by the roof on the toilets. Sunday Gleaner 2 October 1988 The standard question during the immediate post-Gilbert period became' Do you still have a roof? ' In fact, it created quite a bit of amuse ment. It was not so funny, however, for those whose answer was (not) in the affirmative. Sunday Gleaner 2 October 1988 Tourism has been hard hit with the Trident Hotel severely damaged by wind and sea water and extensive looting.... The manager ... reported that one looter was swept away by a huge wave and is missing and presumed dead. Another, cut three of his own fingers off as he attempted to open the hotel safe with a machete. Sunday Gleaner 18 September 1988 Gilbert, in his violence, wrote on the chalk board of the Jamaican countryside the lesson that affluence and poverty have common cause when it comes to nature. Daily Gleaner 20 September 1988 His house no longer exists: ' Me house blow away completely (while he was inside). It lift up and go up about four chain and drop on a next man yard, on his house, and I live under the sky; not'ing leave in de yard so a asking for a tent to live into, to sleep into '. Daily Gleaner 20 September 1988 Stretched on a makeshift bed in the school room, Mr Needham recalled that he was' born 1904 in de month of March'. He remembered a number of hurricanes in the past, noting that whilst those in 1944 and 1951 were' bad ', Gil bert ' badder dan all of dem. Him mash down everyt'ing and gone'. Daily Gleaner 18 September 1988 On the day of the hurricane, she saw waves leaping as if they want to touch the sky and zinc sheets were 'sailing in the sky like birds flying in the air'. Mrs Inez has started to do some work. She has repaired her glass doors, smashed by a 'giant wave'. Daily Gleaner 5 October 1988 We all have had a vibrant re-awakening as a result of the recent hurricane, which has been popularly described as ' Kilbert'. (Advert for roofing material) Sunday Gleaner 2 October 1988 However Gilbert not being a hi-tech man, did not have much regard for this hi-tech sheeting but instead had much more respect for the zinc that was put on my grandfather's house before Hurricane Charlie in 1951 (letter to Editor). Daily Gleaner 22 September 1988 Gilbert, as destructive as he was, will be seen as a catalyst in energising the national spirit of togetherness. Sunday Gleaner 18 September 1988</page><page sequence="9">Hurricane Gilbert 1 15 Table 3 Frequencies of hurricanes in Jamaica 1886-1986 No. of events No. of Relative per year years frequency 0 26 0 257 1 30 0 297 2 19 0188 3 14 0139 4 6 0 059 5 1 0010 6 3 0 030 7 2 0 020 Source: Gray (1988) Another feature worthy of comment regarding people's perception of the disaster and the way they internalised their experiences, relates to the degree of introspection engaged in by people from all walks of life. A common observation was that Gilbert was no respecter of persons, a great social leveller. Some people seemed almost embarrassed to admit to their good fortune in avoiding substantial damage to their property. The looting story alluded to above worked well because it inverted social norms. And several verses of Lovindeer's song (mentioned at the beginning of the paper) played precisely on this theme in describing the antics of a Rastaman during the storm. The perception of Gilbert as a social leveller was perhaps directly related to people's experience of the post-hurricane landscape. Rich people's houses were, quite visibly, just as badly damaged as those of middle income and poor people's housing. A crumpled satellite dish in the street evoked delight rather than sympathy. The geo graphical randomness of the destruction was apparent for all to see. Why should one person's house be so badly damaged, yet his neighbour's house escape unscathed? In a developing country like Jamaica, with stark income and class differentials, and in a third world city like Kingston, with pockets of poor communities in close spatial proximity to ostentatiously affluent areas, the symbolism of Gilbert as personifying nature, an omnipotent social leveller, a humbler of the mighty, was not lost on the population at large. To conclude, the paper has documented the impact of hurricane Gilbert, and commented on aspects of the anthropomorphism associated with the event. Humour, in this context, had a rallying effect in helping people to cope psychologically with the disaster. It is suggested that anthropomorphism in this instance may be a form of cognitive dissonance. Further examples of the anthropomorphising of natural hazards are needed before a more general understanding can be reached.

He used the names of politicians he did not like. 4 US Air Force and Navy meteorologists appear to have originated the gender bias in naming tropical storms during the Second World War. They used the names of wives and girlfriends. 5 There are separate lists of names for Pacific and Atlantic tropical storms.
