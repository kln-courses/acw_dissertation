<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAADIA GAON 'S ARABIC VERSION OF THE BOOK OF ISAIAH Sadok Masliyah University of Utah Saadia Gaon 's Arabic translation of the Bible is connected to the history of the Jews (and Christians) under the rule of the mighty Muslim Caliphates in Palestine, Egypt, Syria and North Africa. The Caliphs, Muhammad's successors, conquered Syria, Palestine and Egypt in the short time between 635 and 638 A.D., and the northern coast of Africa in 711 A.D. The language of the conquerors gradually and inevitably replaced the native tongues of the subjugated nations. Palestinian Aramaic, Syrian, Coptic and other less important languages waned under the growing influence and importance of Arabic. Arabic was, by the 9th century, the Lingua Franca of the Orient. This process seems to have occurred faster in Palestine and Syria, due to the great affinity between the Arabic and Aramaic dialects. It is reasonable to assume that the presence of an Arab population, even before the Arab conquest, speeded the domination of Arabic in those countries. It is difficult, however, to determine the exact extent of the domination of Arabic among the Jews. The similarity in the social condition of Jews and Christians shows that, after the early victories of the Muslims, Arabic civili zation and its proximity brought the Jews into very close contact with the Arabic language. Commentaries on the Bible and Talmud, questions and answers and Midrashim were composed in Arabic, yet the Bible translation and the Arabic liturgy were not used in the synagogues. Use of Arabic in other fields is attributed to the author's desire to reach the widest audience possible. There are suggestions that Arabic was used because Hebrew was thought to be inadequate for expressing a wide range of ideas. However, these possibilities are improbable. The most plausible explanation for using Arabic is that the Jews, like the Christians, considered writing in Arabic the most natural and effortless thing to do. They probably felt that in compositions on science, as distinguished from artistic creations, the language selected had no ideological importance. It is also possible that the prevalence of Arabic among Jews in the Golden Age was a result of a process of urbanization, in the course of which Jews abandoned their spoken language, Aramaic, and adopted Arabic. Strong as the influence of the Arab civilization and language upon the Jews was, Hebrew was still the language of ceremonies. Poetry and a few works of prose were composed in Hebrew and Arabic. The list of books pre served in the Geniza shows that the interest of the average intellectual Jew focused on medicine, science, mathematics and philosophy. The average Jew preferred to read books of Jewish content including Midrashim, which' were often written in Arabic using Hebrew script. Saadia's translation of the Bible was undoubtedly a result of the spiritual and scientific awakening of Islam and Saadia 's desire to reinforce traditional Judaism. Many rival creeds and philosophies, including Zoroas-trianism, Hinduism, Manichaeanism and Qaraism vied for prominence in the intellectual circles 80</page><page sequence="2">of Baghdad during the 10th century. Saadia devoted a considerable part of his literary activities to combat the Qaraites and other sectarian views who dangerously undermined the spiritual foundation of Judaism. Saadia 's life was relatively short (882-942) and troubled, but he was a prolific writer. His literary production1 included philosophy, liturgy, polemics, Talmudica, studies in Hebrew and translations and commentaries on the Bible. He translated into Arabic the Pentateuch, portions of Judges, Isaish, Psalms, the Song of Songs, Job, Daniel, Proverbs, Ruth and possibly Jere miah, and other Biblical books2 using Arabic characters.3 It is assumed that he translated the whole Bible into Arabic and wrote commentaries on a few of its books. Some of his Arabic versions are accompanied by an introduc tion, in which he discusses the scope, purpose, and content of the book. Although his translation of the Bible provoked much criticism from Rab binical scholars and rival sects4 on theological and linguistic grounds, its im portance derived primarily from its being the first extant Arabic translation from the original Hebrew. Furthermore, it is a vital contribution to Judeo Arabic literature, inasmuch as linguistic peculiarities are concerned. Saadia 's Arabic version of some books of the Bible provided an influential model for other Arabic versions by Muslims (Ibn Hazm5, 11th century), Qaraites (Joseph Ben N?fo, 11th century and Japhet Ben 'Ali6) and Samaritans7 (Ab? Sa '?d, 13th century). Jews living in Arab countries in general, and the Yemenites in particular, used Saadia's translation for many generations. Our present study of Saadia's translation of Isaiah9 is based on Deren bourg's edition of the Arabic text constituting the third volume of Oeuvres Completes (Paris 1896). Derenbourg and his son Hartwig provided a French translation of Saadia's version and portions of commentaries (Chapters 14 63) attributed to Saadia. They translated these commentaries into Hebrew and supplied Hebrew notes on Saadia's Arabic translation. However, they failed to point out the peculiarities of Saadia's work and their notes are not comprehensive. Saadia's Arabic verson of Isaiah, as of other books of the Bible, is an in terpretation and translation of the original text. He strives to make his transla tion intelligible, rationally tenable and harmonious with Jewish tradition and Halacha. This may justify the many changes and deviations from the Hebrew text. The liberties that he has taken with Isaiah 's text include modi fications of expressions of the original, omission of some words, addition of other words and phrases, alterations in the structure of the verses, and the joining of verses. Saadia attempts to bring out the simple meaning of the verses by stressing their essential parts. To demonstrate the unity of the book he joins almost every verse to the preceding one by conjunctions, words or phrases. The conjunction waw and the consequence particle fa are frequently employed. Other prepositions used are lamm?, falammo (7:2) for "when"; falidh?lika (20:12) for "therefore"; li'an (45:1) for "because"; idh (42:13) for "since"; wama 'ama (43:22) for "despite"; innama (50:9); bal(29:6) for "but"; batta (41:3) for "until" and "so that. " Some of the conjunctions serve, in addition to linking verses, to maintain Arabic style. Frequently, the last verse of a chapter is joined to the successive one by the verb gala ? "he said" ? and its 81</page><page sequence="3">imperfect form yaqulu9 (62:1-10) or yaqi?li?na (62:10) or by the imperative formez (60:18). Intending to answer the question asked in 42:23 Saadia begins the next verse with the word waya' lamuna ? "and they will know, " referring to the people of Israel who sinned against God. Similarly, when the Lord wants Israel to cite Him to a lawsuit if it feels unjustly oppressed, Saadia uses the word fata1 tarifu ? "so you will confess" (43:27), to be in line with the meaning of the verse. In 1:29 the addition of qila lahum changes the verse into the passive form and requires that rendering of 1 to in the second person plural to accord with DJH Dnandojnnimentioned later in the verse. Saadia's word additions often clarify the ambiguity in the text.Thus,the word waqawmi is added to m * t?K HD * 3 (18:4) to read "the Lord said to me and to my people. " Possibly Saadia added it to emphasize not only the relation ship between the prophet and God, but also the bond between God and His chosen people, Israel. The word ftVlt in ^ 3 *? (40:26) is modified by another word, al-kawakib ? "the stars. " 3 is interpreted as the river Euphrates and translated accordingly al-furSt (11:15). The addition of taqi?lu l-ummatu (25:1) ? "the nation says" introduces the hymn of thanksgiving in that verse. Wa??ra qawmuhu ? "and his people began, " is inserted into 63:11, to distinguish the subject from man in general. Since the subject matter is the injustice and corruption prevailing in Jerusalem, Saadia translates 311 ^ * !&gt;* X (1:21) to kayfa sarat t?giya al-qaryatu l-amina: "how has the faithful city become a tyrant. " In 2:10 he changes the subject of the verse by adding yaqulu ba'duhum liba'd: "one says to another, " thus the focus of the verse is shifted to the people of the city on the Day of Judg ment. He makes 01 * in 43:10, 13 an important day, the day of the Sinai Revelation. Furthermore, * T^Dft mo JiJTO (6:1) does not refer, in Saadia's opinion, to Uzziah's death, but to the year in which the king became a leper and ceased to rule. Since Sennacherib could not seize the for tified cities of Judah, Saadia translates 1 J VDfl * 1 fah?sarah?(36:1) "and he besieged it. " Again, TO* 711ft * %D (14:32) becomes in Saadia's version "for the Lord will cause Zion to be inhabited. " He ex plains in his commentary10 that he did not translate 10* "erected" be cause Zion had already been erected. It is also to be noted that Saadia adds a subject, a verb, an adverb, or a whole phrase in order to restore balance, to emphasize the action, or to clarify the meaning. The subject of the verb 1XI* (41:20) is qualified by inserting al-natiquna, "the intelligent ones"; the verbs wasami 'tum, "you heard," sa 'al?, "they asked" and the adverb tha'iran, "overflowing," respectively, are inserted into 1:19, 40:6 and 48:18. Most of the adverbs supplied are absolute, i.e., derived from the same verb pattern. Sabba sabban (44:13) and yajiff? jafafan (60:12) are cases in point. In a number of verses Saadia tries to maintain a balance between the parts of his verses by supplying a word in the second part of his verse, e.g. waqulu "and say " vis-Vvis * tp . Thus the verse becomes "Sing unto the Lord a new song and say His praise from the end of the Earth" (42:10). Maintain ing a balance sometimes entails certain interpretation of the original, in ac 82</page><page sequence="4">cordance with its sense. 0*1 It ? "person" is translated as "women" to con trast with F*X ? "man" mentioned earlier in the verse (44:13). Elsewhere, Saadia translates 11 y ? "blind" as deaf (42:19) for the same reason. In 44:22 the additional verb wa 'atajawazu "and I will pass, " referring to the sins of Israel is parallel to the preceding verb ?1 0 X ? "I will sweep away. " Other changes in Saadia's version include omission of words, substituting some types of clauses for others, and changing the tense of verses. Saadia deletes words which do not, in his opinion, contribute to the meaning of the sentence. Thus he omits *D from 45:18. Because the vineyard is mentioned earlier in verse 45:4, he deletes * 3 V in his translation. He reduces two synonymous phrases or words to one, e.gTpOJ001 (22:19) "from your office and post" becomes min mawqifiki: "from your post. " *\TXI X1131 1 "1*1* (45:7) is translated "Fash ioner of light and Creator of darkness, " the second verb is omitted. W D *B 3 D 0*533 (6:2) is reduced to one. Here are some examples of changing types of clauses: a. Changing indicative clauses into conditional ones, mainly by introducing the protasis with in "if" and the apodosis with fa, e.g. 0 * 11 D*DXV 190X*1 Itl?* ntapJ (43:9) is transformed to "if all the groups assembled who amongst them expound these things. " The addi tion of the conditional phrase 'ala h??li l-khata'i, "if you sin " in 20:4 is to stress that God will not abandon Israel if the latter gives the poor their legal rights. Similarly, the insertion of the phrase in k?na tallaqtuha (50:1), "if I deliver it " emphasizes that the exile did not mark the end of the Lord 's rela tions with Israel, who is metaphorically compared to a woman. b. Changing imperative phrases to perfect or imperfect ones, as in l?lp |1D 1 0 0*1tfH (21:5), which Saadia translates waqad qama ru'asa 'uhum wamasahi? l-malika minhum: "their princes had already risen and annointed the kine from amongst them. "In lV V* 1*13 H*Vx IXIpl oVni* (40:2) Saadia renders the imperatives ?T and IXTP respectively "they spoke" and "they called, " referring "they" to jama'a ? "a group of people " which he adds. c. Changing interrogative clauses to causal clauses by employing fa 'innama (1:11) and mimrna (1:22). d. Changing interrogative clauses into statements and vice-versa, e.g. 1?H?V*1 1 3*! *1 Xy\* *D fix (40:14) is rendered fat?ba man shawarahu fafahhamahu subula l-hukmi: "Happy is the one who confers with Him so that He teaches him ways of Justice. " Turn ing *Ji?T* Va 1?I pXI MyVaD niVx * (44:8) "Is there any God besides Me? There is no Creator but that I know him" to a rhetorical question is achieved by inserting wahal yajuzu ? "it is possible that. " e. The imperative clause *D &gt;131 11 nxV * OJ?X D*flVx (41:23) is transformed into a conditional one in Saadia 's hands: "If you declare that which has happened in the past, then we shall know you are nobles. " Here Saadia translates 11 nxV not "here after" as one may expect, but in a way which refers to what has happened and implies that it applies to the future, too.11 f. At times, Saadia interchanges the perfect form with the imperfect form, 83</page><page sequence="5">especially when the text deals with the redemption of Israel. For example, he translates the second verb of f *J10KD ^ *mn:i (41:9) to "I will not cast you away, " to stress God 's eternal care for Israel. The verb pint* in the phrase Villi* It (41:10) referring to Israel, is put in the future tense: "I shall strengthen you as I have helped you." Similarly, V*W&amp; a*3 *j1*t1? (44:22) becomes "so I shall sweep away your sins like the passing cloud, " adding al-mar "the passing " as a qualifier for the cloud. Elsewhere, Saadia mentions God's love for Israel by altering the literal meaning of the text. In translating * 3* 1 aJTl Wtl VxiV*D (9:13) Saadia omits the word Vxi?*d and adds minhum ? "from them, " attributing it to the various peoples mentioned in the previous verse. Saadia deals with the infinitives in T*** 10* Vi 0*DV *03^ ?ij1x *M ?1*XV IDxVl (51:16) in an interesting fashion. He translates the first two as the perfect and the third as the imperfect form, adding "as. . .so. " His version reads: "as I fixed the Heavens in place and formed the Earth, so shall I say to the people of Zion: you are my people. " Saadia also excludes what is logically impossible and tries to avoid over statements. Whenever possible, he reduces poetic metaphors to common equivalent Arabic words. Thus, 3 9 T01 ? * TO (3:1) "prop and stay " is rendered "man and woman "; n *? (5:26) "he will hoist a signal to him "; 10 y 1 (9:14) "and they will walk. " Saadia uses literary devices by introducing an element of comparison such as shubh, nizr (1:10), shabTh (6:13, 46:4; 48:3), mithl (48:3), "like," "as." In 46:3 he employs the words al-mum?athil?na ? "those who resemble" and his translation reads "Hearken unto me, O house of Israel who resemble the sons who are born from the belly." He inserts ka'anna and ka'annaka ? "as if" and "as if you" in 22:16 and 44:18. 49:16 which ridicules idolators: wala ya'lamuna lijahlihim wal?yafham?na ka 'anna '?y?nahum qad t?masat adding the word lijahlihim "because of their ignorance"; and neither do they know their ignorance nor understand, as if their eyes were made too blind to see. " Elsewhere he adds qad followed by the imperfect form to introduce an element of doubt in the meaning and to blunt exaggeration, e.g. qadya'rifu th-thawru q?ri?hi (1:3)? "perhaps the ox knows his owner " and waqadyasjuru minhum wayakh -tabizu khubzan waqad yaj'alu ma'budan (44:15): "and perhaps he kindles and bakes of it bread and perhaps he makes into a god. " For the same reason Saadia employs the simile particle ka ? "like" and yakadu ? "almost." *J*X!1* n^T? **TT jnXD *flTSp (38:12) is rendered "Thou has cut short my life like a weaver because of the pains that almost destroy me! " The frequent use of ba94 "some, a few" in 6:12, 22:10, 14 serves the same purpose of turning improbable statements into rational ones. Saadia often employs such expressions as wakarna. . .kadhalika, kam? anna. . .kadhalika, kama. . .ka12 "as. . .so," so as to leave no doubt that some verses should be understood metaphorically. For example, Saadia's verse 40:7 reads: "As the grass dries and the flower withers, so when God's wind blows upon them, so are the people who are in analogy with them " for##?Dx ist natfj mn* rm &gt;d ** Vai * va* The influence of Targum Jonathan on Saadia's Arabic version of Isaiah 84</page><page sequence="6">is evident not only in his systematic attempts to avoid anthropomorphism but also in adapting some of the Targum interpretations. The following com parisons are only a few examples demonstrating the impact of the Targum on Saadia's Isaiah. Both the Targum and Saadia refer verse 40:8 to the wicked. The Targum inserts 0 V T01 * in 40:1 and Saadia adds dam s-salam, "the city of peace. " Furthermore, the renderings of * 3 3 V 3 3 1 MX3S 1 * (22:14); in* TT ^ MO 3 TO (6:1) and 1 *t? 1133 (46:11) are identical in both translations. Saadia has the first faqad atla 'amrabbu l-juyushi; the second ? sana tin abrasa ?h? l-maliku Uzziya and the third min ladhTdhi karamiha which correspond respectively to the Targum's renderings: ** Dip ]0 XI 1T3J?K ID ; n*ty nsVo 3 yi3Jixi ktito and Hip *. Again the influence of the Targum is evident also on Saadia's trans lation of 5:19 and 7:23. In his translation, Saadia presents God as the omnipotent, invisible creator. God's power and His justice are expressed in 11:4, where Saadia adds "by His permission" and "He will kill the one who deserves it, " or by inserting bihtukmin ("by a judgment") to 42:28, to show that God sentences people only after a trial. Similarly, Saadia adds to 22:22 siwahu and ghayruhu "ex cept Him " to indicate God's oneness and power. In treating attributes of God and anthropomorphism, Saadia's transla tion coincides, in many cases, with the Targumim. Following the Mu 'tazilites, he refuses to admit any attributes of God other than unity, power and wis dom, inasmuch as they involve neither multiplicity nor variety in God. These attributes, he suggests in his "The Book of Doctrines and Beliefs " imply the notion of God as a creator.13 His treatment of anthropomorphism is not remotely connected with his views on God's attributes. His endeavor to interpret the sensuous statements concerning God in the Bible in a way that would give them spiritual meaning is in accord with Jewish theology itself. According to Saadia, anthropomor phic expressions which we use in speaking of God, have a symbolic and fig urative meaning. They show the tendency of language to broaden the mean ing of words, and must not be taken literally, as when applied to man.14 An thropomorphism in the Books of the Prophets should be understood in a way which conforms to the dictates of Reason. The word "head" is used by the prophets in the sense of excellency and elevation; "eye" is used in the sense of supervision; "face" means favor or anger; "ear" denotes acceptance; "mouth" means teaching and command; "hand" denotes power; "heart" wisdom, etc. These principles are usually (thought not always) followed in Saadia's Arabic version. The word |*7 ? "eye " is replaced by another; 1*3*73 (38:3) be comes baynayadayka: "in your presence "; * * 3 * y 3 (49:5): 'indahu "with him." 1*3*73 71*1 (59:15): wasa'a 'indahu "and he disliked. " Saadia makes also extensive use of the preposition 'inda when he tries to avoid attributes to God, e.g. Hin* 1*0 (40:2; 50:17) is rendered min Hnda l-lahi ? "from God. " The word 1 * in 41:20 is suppressed or replaced by the word qudra: "power." However, in 59:6, 12 it is trans lated literally. Qudra also stands for y lit (40:11). 9 ? "mouth" is rendered qawl, an equivalent to memra used by the Scribes (Sofrim) or by 85</page><page sequence="7">amr? "order" (11:4; 40:2; 45:23). 1 3TIC , when referring to God, is de leted in 59:6 and 1 * is replaced inn * VW- "in God's shadow" (49:2) by the corresponding suffix ha attached to zil "shadow. " In dealing with God's visibility, a problem which has occupied Jewish theologians and philosophers since the era of the Second Temple, Saadia follows the Targumim. *39 mxiV IXaJl * D of 1:12 becomes in Saadia's hand "if you appear before Me. " Verse 6:1 which concerns the very essence of God is handled by Saadia by re-interpreting the subject. Thus it is not God who sits on the chair but the nur ? "light" or glory of God. So Saadia's translation of this verse is: "I saw the light of God sitting. " To prevent the heresy that the angels stand above God, he in troduces some syntactical changes in 6:2. He separates V?dd and iV and makes the angels stand in a high place but not above God. In 59:17 he eliminates anthropomorphism by avoiding literal translation of HplX wV* 1 , and translating it fa^?hara 'adlahu "so He re vealed His justice. " Again, in xai bp ay by idi * nan 0*150 (19:1) he translates "God entrusts His decree to a swift cloud which goes to Egypt. " Substituting the verb form hifil for kal is another common device employed in Saadia's version. He applies the caus ative form to the verb 1 a * in 3:14 so that his translation reads "and the Lord will make the old man of His people and their chief enter judgment. " In Saadia 's Arabic Isaiah God reveals His words to the prophet so that the latter does not act independently and spontaneously. The addition of wahyu l-lahi "God's revelation" in 1:1 attests that the prophet is inspired by the word of God, and hence his words will come true.15 Other features and peculiarities of Saadia 's Arabic Isaiah are: a. Replacing Hebrew words by equivalent Arabic words of similar sound, e.g. V*?? (A\:6)fat?s\ pilli (41:15) tadiqquhum and fO mawijl (41:15). At times, these Arabic words do not possess the meaning required by the Hebrew text, e.g. 3 ODyX? ? "jingle" (3:16) is rendered 'akasa which means "he reversed." 0 *0 * 1 (3:22) becomes "cone shape" (makhrut); nip(28:27)Kash ? "hip" and *|1 31 (62:3) ? sanTf which does not exist elsewhere in Arabic. b. Some of the proper names and names of places are left unchanged, others are translated into Arabic entirely or partially. For example, the name 111 has its Arabic equivalent D?wi?d; bt 130* is left untranslated in 7:14 and 8:8 but in 8:10 it is translated to "the Lord is with us. " tilV ra ID (7:3) is translated as "the field of the Fullers" and pO* 0*Kfi 1(17:5) is partially translated as 'emek ash-shaj'a, "the valley of the courageous people. " c. A few of the places, animals and objects are not identified by Saadia: Calne (10:9) becomes a place in Sicily ar-riqqa and 0*3*0 fix (49:12) "Syene" is understood as "the land of China." Saadia renders 1*p (15:1) literally as "wall" rather than a name of place, yet 015(19:18) VITI and l*OK (17:9) appear in Saadia's Isaiah as names of cities. d. The animals 0* ? "owls" (13:21) and 11 Bp (34:15) "sand partridge " are identified as numus ? "ichneumon" and qunfudh ? "hedge hog" respectively. The Egyptian Sea (11:15) is "the Egyptian lake" and "the gorge of Arabim " is "the valley of Arabim " inJSaadia's version. 86</page><page sequence="8">e. As far as objects are concerned, especially ornaments, Saadia 's trans lation of 0*00? (3:18) as "shoes," IV as "belt" (3:19) D&gt;OTlV (3:20) as "bracelet" is noteworthy. Number seven and its multiplicant are understood by Saadia as "many " (4:1 ; 7:13; 5:10). f. It is interesting to note also Saadia's understanding of some of the He brew words. He derives ? ko (9:4) from ico; hd? po (5:5) from nmOOl *| do ; *]p 3 from HSpn (10:34) and V 1 3(44:19) from hVd. * 1D*n of * O V * d'n is perceived by Saadia as de rived from -|11D (47:13). He also considers??i ras taken from ]y (22:5). In translating ftVlOJ as MVIOV he brings Nehemia (21:15) in support.16 g. To make his translation suitable to the Arabic readers, Saadia borrows Arabic words derived from Muslim terminology, e.g. * jhd (61:6) a'imma, "muslim priests." In 29:1 he uses too mawsim ? "the season of pilgrimage. " The word *p (38:2) is translated qibla, to in dicate a place of worship. Saadia 's Arabic version of Isaiah includes also a number of grammatical mistakes (which may be attributed to the copyist) and colloquialisms as one scholar noted.17 However, his version is simple and pleasing to read.
