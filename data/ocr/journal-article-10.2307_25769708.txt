<plain_text><page sequence="1">Signorelli's banner and its frame for the Confraternity of St Anthony Abbot in Sansepolcro by DAVID FRANKLIN i. View of the interior of S. Antonio, Sansepolcro. luca signorelli's double-sided banner has recently been returned to its original place on the high altar of the church of S. Antonio in Borgo Sansepolcro (Figs.2 and 3).1 This was the occasion for a study of the painting's original wooden frame which has hitherto been neglected, in spite of its imposing scale and high quality (Fig.4).2 The banner was commissioned by the Confraternity of St Anthony Abbot, one of the more venerable flagellant brotherhoods in Sansepolcro, which was already in existence in the 1330s.3 By 1345 construction of the church of S. Antonio at the southern end of Sansepolcro, with its broad sin gle nave, was completed (Fig.i). It is known from documents that Signorelli's banner was executed around 1505-06, following his completion of the frescos in Orvieto Cathedral.4 The purpose of this article is to review the banner's known documentation, adding some previously unpublished references, and to present its wooden frame. One side of the banner shows the Crucifixion. Although a subject not explicitly linked to the dedication of the brother hood, its selection betrays the universal obsession on the part of confraternities with Christ's suffering and is to that degree not unexpected. More specifically, given the explicit link to Christ's death in the founding myth of Sansepolcro itself and the rever ence paid to the sculpture of the Volto Santo in the abbey church, which shows Christ crucified, a representation of the Crucifix ion, including St John the Evangelist, one of the town's patron saints, is very natural.5 At the foot of the Cross, the Virgin has fainted and rests in the arms of two Marys, a group developed by Signorelli from earlier images of this subject. Presenting the swooning Virgin with closed eyes may be an attempt to equate her with the Dead Christ in a manner later made more explicit in Rosso Fiorentino's Deposition from the Cross for S. Croce in Sansepolcro. A distraught John the Evangelist stands behind the group on the viewer's left. Anthony Abbot, one of the saints to whom the Confraternity was dedicated, links the small, sinewy figure of the crucified Christ to the group of women. In an extraordinarily audacious pose, for which the Confraternity doubdess gave their explicit approval, Anthony holds the cross in his right hand and gestures downwards with his left. St John the Evangelist is placed to the right of Christ, as befits the evangelist to whom the Camaldolese Abbey - the principal church in Sansepolcro ? was popularly dedicated. The deposition from the Cross is depicted in the background with an expanded cast of I would like to thank Luigi Andreini, Franco Ballini, James Banker, Michael Bury, Gino Corti, Caroline Elam, Tom Henry, Lawrence Kanter, Antonia Reiner and Louis Waldman for their assistance in the preparation of this article. 1 Previously it was displayed in the Museo Civico, Borgo Sansepolcro.

By the eighteenth century the Confraternity's hospital faced a crisis and the Confraternity of S. Bartolomeo took control of it. In the same century the Confraternity of St Anthony Abbot was also amalgamated with one dedicated to the Buon Gesu and the merged confraternities 512 AUGUST 2010 CLII THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE</page><page sequence="2">SIGNORELLI'S BANNER 2. Crucifixion, by Luca Signorelli. c. 1505?06. Canvas, 175 by 210 cm. (S. Antonio, Sansepolcro). characters. Christ's Cross is placed at an oblique angle flanked by the other two crosses, and an anthropomorphic face emerges from in the cloud beneath the crucified Christ's right arm. A similar visual conceit is present, as has been frequently noted, in Andrea Mantegna's earlier painting of St Sebastian in Vienna.6 The other side of Signorelli's banner, now facing the apse of the church, shows Sts Anthony Abbot and Eligius depicted on an imposing scale (Fig.3), their robes falling in deep, jagged folds. Anthony wears a blue habit and carries a wooden staff, while Eligius (the St Alo encountered in the sources is synonymous with Eligius) holds his attributes of a severed horse's leg and a file for paring horses' hooves. Eligius, also a patron saint of the Confraternity, is not represented on the other side of the canvas. Stylistically, St Anthony owes an unmistakable debt to Piero della Francesca, with whom Signorelli had studied in Arezzo. The two saints seem to float on a multicoloured ground, recalling similar effects in the Orvieto frescos. Four members of the Confraternity are represented on a diminutive scale, as was conventional in processional banners. Although it is not signed, and was not mentioned in Vasari's Life of the artist, the Sansepolcro banner is a work of the highest 3. Sts Anthony Abbot and EUgius, by Luca Signorelli. c. 1505-06. Reverse of Fig.2. quality in Signorelli's characteristically tense and forthright style. Documents surviving in the ledgers of the Confraternity allow the banner and its frame to be reasonably accurately dated and, while Signorelli's name is not given, there is no reason to doubt that the banner is the one mentioned in them. The commission dates from 22nd May 1505, when the prior of the Confraternity was authorised to convene with two other members in order to commission a processional banner ('fare fare uno gonfalone per la nostra compania buono e bello') at whatever price was necessary (see Appendix 1 below). Precisely when the painter signed the con tract is, unfortunately, not specified, and also undated is a newly discovered note of payment to a member of the Confraternity for having gone to Cortona 6per lo gonf alone9, presumably a visit to Signorelli's studio for a preHminary discussion about the project (see Appendix 2a). After 1505 the Confraternity's account books reveal more about the early history of the banner and provide a minute record of its physical appearance. Several have been published, but for the sake of clarity it is useful to review them all. On 8th Decem ber 1506, eighteen months after the prior's formal deliberations, a payment is recorded for lamp oil and thread to sew the new were dedicated to the Holy Sacrament. Eventually, the Confraternity of St Mary Magdalene also joined them. 4 Part of this article is a revised version of L.B. Kanter and D.

THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CLII AUGUST 2010 5J3</page><page sequence="3">SIGNORELLI'S BANNER canvas together, which was painted in two separate pieces (see Appendix 3 a). From this document, it is probable that the finished picture had been delivered from Cortona to Sansepolcro by then: a year and a half was enough time for Signorelli to have completed a painting of this scale. On 6th June 1507, another modest payment was made to a local painter, Mario Dedi, alias Maestro Orso, for painting a pole for the new banner (see Appendix 3b). On 1st May 1508 a member of the Confraternity was paid for an excursion to Florence where he purchased some materials, perhaps the fringe, for the banner (see Appendix 3c). On 28th May 1508 a length of linen was acquired to decorate its border (see Appendix 3d), and on 19th June 1508 payments were made for a fringe and more thread to affix it (see Appendix 3e). A payment was made around 1508?09 to another local painter, Cristofano Renzetti, for the 'depentura del gonfalone\ which was presumably also related to some aspect of its presentation (Appendix 2b). The employment of local painters to complete minor decorative aspects of the banner indicates that Signorelli was not asked to involve himself with the details of its completion and presentation, only to supply the main paintings, a division of labour that was not necessarily typical of the period. Nor was Signorelli involved in the design or production of the frame. Further evidence survives for how the banner was displayed. As a processional standard, it had to be portable, and the payment of 1507 to Maestro Orso relates to its pole (Appendix 3 b). But the Confraternity could economise by also using the banner as the high altarpiece for their church and they therefore took care to protect it in an elaborate frame. The relatively good condition of the canvas today implies that the banner was also venerated as a work of art, and perhaps it was more cherished than many such banners because of its dual function. A payment of 1519 reveals that the banner was covered with a fabric curtain, like any precious altarpiece (see Appendix 3f). The Crucifixion side of the banner now faces the nave of the church of S. Antonio, while the side with the two saints faces the apse. With any double-sided object, the question arises as to which side was considered to be the side to face the congregation. In this case, the presence of a painted border of alternating red and blue panels with gold grotesques alVantica might suggest that the two saints were intended to be the principal face. Yet evidence of pastoral visits to the church in Sansepolcro reveals that the Confraternity exhibited both sides. The earliest source to cite the painting dates from 1629 and mentions the gilt wood frame containing an image of the Crucifixion.7 Just six years later, how ever, in 1635, the two saints were shown,8 and they were still on show at the time of the visitation in 1639.9 References to the painting dating from the early nineteenth century, however, reveal that the Crucifixion was once again facing outwards.10 The frame (Fig. 4) deserves attention as a significant work of art in its own right. The framing of the new banner is first mentioned in a document of 13th January 1509, when the woodworker Jacopo Begni was paid for 'two tabernaculo per lo gonfalone etper lapredella of an altar the exact location of which is not specified (see Appendix 2c).11 In the same document we learn that the payment for the various jobs was assessed by Antonio di Giuliano Schiaminossi of Sansepolcro and by a 'maestro Domenicho', a Florentine, for a total of 42 lire and 10 soldi. An instalment of this sum was disbursed on 7th December of the same year (Appendix 2d). These sums of money are far too insignificant to cover the cost of the impressive frame, however, which would suggest that the documents of 1509 relate to some pre-extant structure. To judge by the sort of tasks documented by other payments relating to the banner, this was the moment (c. 1507?10) when Signorelli's painting was finally prepared for installation, and so the relatively cheap work undertaken by Jacopo Begni can presumably be understood in that context. Rather than producing a new frame, the wood worker was probably adapting an earlier frame to Signorelli's picture on its arrival. Another series of minor payments made between 1507 and 1510 to those responsible for the installation ('' acconciaturd) of the banner, further support this view (Appendix 2e?g). This interpretation of the documents is justifiable on economic grounds considering that the Confraternity (an organisation which tended, by necessity, to be financially conservative) would have preferred not to order an expensive new banner and frame at the same time. It seems, therefore, that the commission for Signorelli's picture, despite its importance for the Confraternity, did not initially involve the production of a costly new frame, but that it was placed in an older structure. This also confirms that his banner was of the same monumental dimensions as the one it replaced. That Signorelli's painting substituted an earlier one can be established from documents discovered by James Banker indicating that a banner was ordered in 1416 from an Aretine painter resident in Sansepolcro named Simone di Domenico, alias Maestro Zoppo.12 That banner included a representation of a standing St Anthony Abbot. It can also be documented that the Confraternity of St Anthony Abbot ordered a painting on canvas in 1450 for a recently founded third altar in their church, dedicated to St Anthony of Padua, which was apparently a prod uct of Antonio d'Anghiari's workshop.13 To digress briefly, on 14th April 1491 a fourth altar was ordered to be built near a sculpture of the 'corpd of St Anthony following in 'modo et forma' the chapels of Niccolo Pichi and MugUano MigUorati, both of which were in the Camaldolese abbey church of Sansepolcro.14 Nonetheless, it must have always been the brotherhood's wish to install Signorelli's painting more lavishly on their high altar than they could have afforded in 1509 because a second, fuller set of payments survive from the early 1530s for an entirely new frame, doubtless the one still in situ. According to these, the Confraternity paid Bartolomeo di Jacopo Begni (the son of the Begni involved in the 1509 work on the high altar) 32 scudi for the 'tabernacle' for the high altar over an eight-month period 7 Sansepolcro, Archivio Vescovile (hereafter AVBSS), Visite Pastorali, 1623, Anno 1629, fols.i69v?i7or: 'Habet icona depicta in tela cum imagine domini Crucifissi, et alios sanctos, et habet omamentum Hgneum et totum de auratum . 8 AVBSS, Visite Pastorali, Anno 1635, fol.25v: Tcona est depicta in tela cum imagine sanctorum Antonio et Alo, et omatum est Hgneum de auratum'. 9 AVBSS, Visite Pastorali, Anno 1639, fol.i33v: Tcona est depicta in tela utraque parte, a parte anteriori sunt imagines Sancti Antonii et Aloysii, a parte inferiori imagines Domini Crucijixi et alies imagines.

Antonio brotherhood for Antonio da Anghiari to paint the tabernacle' for the altar containing the Crucifix in 143 2.16 The wording of some of the payments indicate that Bar tolomeo Begni was also responsible for subcontracting part of the labour to an unnamed Florentine woodworker, who presumably undertook the more important role of carving the complex decorative parts of the frame. So it appears that the basic structure of the frame was the work of Bartolomeo Begni ? an artisan experienced in local architectural customs ? but the more highly skilled carving of the florid relief sculpture was executed in Florence, a typical example of the collaborative nature of much artistic production in this period. Bartolomeo received his final payment on account on 30th April 1533. A 5. Reverse of Fig.4. coincidental payment to a stonemason on the same day for preparing the high altar for the tabernacle ('per avere murato all'altare grande per mectare el tabemacholo9), also suggests that the new frame was about to be installed (Appendix 4e). This ledger entry indicates that the new tabernacle was for the high altar, something not explicitly stated in any payment to Bartolomeo Begni. This interpretation of the documents relating to the S. Antonio high altar commission produces the perhaps unex pected conclusion that the frame and banner were understood as complementary but, in terms of their production and by implication their style, quite independent objects. This sequence of events surrounding the commission of Signorelli's banner and frame is yet more complex because it emerges that the brotherhood did not commission the surmount ing lunette until nearly three decades after the main structure. It is by the foremost local painter of the period (and former pupil of Giulio Romano), Raffaellino del Colle.17 A contract, sacrament, but a monumental frame to hold a painted altarpiece, as is apparent from other documents from Sansepolcro, including that for Rosso's Deposition from the Cross; see D.

Antonio and to paint God the Father in the semicircle above it.18 He was also required to paint angels and saints, as appropriate according to the painter's judgment, in the 'squanci9 of the tabernacle, which are, presumably, those areas between the pilasters and the interi or moulding that would have held Signorelli's painting in its frame. Raffaellino personally signed the contract along with the prior and other officials of the Confraternity, who allowed the painter to execute the work in their main meeting room. Because of the reference to the lunette above the tabernacle, this document confirms that Habemacolo9 indicates the entire frame, and not simply a sacrament tabernacle. Examination of the verso (Fig. 5) of the lunette reveals that it is composed of horizontal planks with some crudely painted shields in the upper half on a dark ground, which suggests that Raffaellino was asked to Appendix 1.

Graduated payments were made to the artist on account from 17th November 1561 to 8th July 1562, by which time the work was presumably completed.20 Like the Piero della Francesca commissions in Sansepolcro in the previous century, the project for S.
