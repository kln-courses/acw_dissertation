<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH A Quarterly Journal VOLUME III, No. 4 June, 1943 DEWEY ON MATERIALISM' The purpose of this paper is to sharpen issues in contemporary philosophy by championing an ontology which, it seems to me, has not had justice done to it. That ontology is materialism. It goes without saying that I am not seeking to resurrect an outmoded type linked inseparably with an outgrown form of physics, Democritean or classical. No; it must be a reformed materialism; it must be a kind of materialism which is philosophically and scientifically sophisticated. On the one hand, it must be able to give a good account of itself epistemologi- cally, in terms of a realism able to defend the common belief in a physical world against the attacks of idealists and phenomenalists. On the other hand, it must be free from purely dead-level, mechanistic notions, that is, it must be informed by evolutionary ideas and be ready to absorb such notions as those of emergence, organization, dynamic patterns, intrinsic activity. In short, it must be a rendition of materialism fully in touch with the best traditions of philosophical thinking and not an antique model fit to be used only as an awful example, as is so frequently the case. It must have speculative depth, awareness that it must save such realities as mind, consciousness, and value. But why materialism? My answer is that I believe in ontology, in a theory of existence; and that I know of no other term which, in the last analysis, is more candid, more indicative of a readiness on the part of naturalism to grapple with ontology, than the term materialism. It is for this reason-among others-that I regard it as a gesture in the right direction. If material things exist, we must be either materialists or dualists. To many, of course, the word is a little shocking. And that-fact is quite understandable and has its historical causes. Let us admit at once that any materialism which is likely to stay in the lists must find a place within the contours of an evolutionary naturalism. It must be freed from its reduc- tionism, its mechanicalism, its mere picture-thinking. In short, it must be a truly philosophical materialism fully cognizant of the niceties of theory of knowledge and able to handle and apply categories. And that is why I speak of it as a reformed materialism. It is obvious that the rise of such a materialism presupposed the modern ' A paper read before Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Associa- tion, December, 1941. 381</page><page sequence="2">382 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH development of realism. So long as idealism-and even experientialism- was dominant, materialism could have no assured philosophical standing. It hung in the air, so to speak, without epistemological support. But, in these days, that situation has, as all are aware, been profoundly altered. It would even seem that idealism is on the defensive though the advance of realism has been held up in some measure by skirmishing in the inter- mediate zone along lines of positivism, phenomenalism, pragmatism. In the present paper I shall make what I consider relevant remarks on Dewey's type of pragmatism and shall disregard the other two isms, not because I do not consider them interesting, academic phenomena but because I judge Dewey's outlook to be more full-blooded. One other point which, however, does not need undue expansion. To say with so many scientists, engaged in apologetics as an avocation, that a developed notion of matter, responsible to an array of newly developed facts, represents a rejection of the very idea of matter is to talk logical nonsense. Let us admit to the full that ideas of matter are changing. No philosopher who has wrestled with Berkeley was surprised by the fact though he could not have anticipated the new data. Nevertheless, the generic context remains the same. There are molar things, and these have microscopic constituents, something which Lucretius well knew. I I have chosen Dewey and his form of pragmatism as an opposition for three reasons: (1) because he is frankly naturalistic; (2) because I have been querying his emphases since the days of the old Chicago School; and (3) because he has recently been led to declare himself on the subject of materialism because of Professor Savery's pointed questions. Needless to say, though I have been somewhat piqued by Dewey's rejection of epistemology and ontology, I could see his reasons. These I have tried to bring out. I argue that he was too hasty in setting up his alternative. My own line of procedure, on the other hand, was to integrate episte- mology and ontology in terms of a physical realism based on the distinction between sensing and a denotative and characterizing perceiving. I was thereupon led to take such categories as substance, causality, space, time, organization, and emergence seriously and to move in the direction of a reformed, qualitative, and differentiated materialism. In a, recent article in the Philosophical Review,2 I have outlined the difference between the concepts of science, such as s, t, and causal law, and the categories of ontology built around substance. It is the difference between spread-out, mensurational knowledge of facts about being and being itself as empiri- 2 January, 1943.</page><page sequence="3">DEWEY ON MATERIALISM 383 ally categorized. Only if scientific knowledge were a direct intuition could it be otherwise. We must expect this spread and translation in science. Let me briefly illustrate what I mean. What, in existence, is a local activity becomes, for science, a dated event. Causality, which actually moves from the activations of agents to new equilibria, is readily conceived in terms of laws connecting the past with the present. We have to do here with a cognitive translation which the ontologist must carefully scrutinize. What is. more, the whole concept of existence tends to vanish or become ghostly. The emphasis is upon knowledge and not upon existence. All of which signifies that science concentrates upon verified fact, that is, upon cases of knowledge, and, quite understandably, ignores ontological ques- tions so far as possible. It is for this reason that it is the most natural thing in the world for it to reify probability symbols and to confuse indeter- minism in knowledge with causal indeterminism, to take the relativity of measurements for some kind of intrinsic multiplicity, to confuse s and t with space and time as ontological categories, etc. The consequence is that the scientist is prone to adopt positivism and operationalism. Now those who have read Dewey's The Quest for Certainty can recall that he tended to follow this same line. And it is a quite logical one for the experientialist, for a thinker who is inclined to hold that science is all- sufficient in matters of cosmology, who does not seek to sharpen episte- mology and integrate it with a careful analysis of ontological categories, such as substance and causal activity. In these brief indications of what seem to me basic differences in perspec- tive I am only voicing my belief that a realistic empiricism developed along the lines of a cooperation between epistemology and ontology clarifies the difference between knowledge and being. I should like to call attention to Professor Swabey's book, Being and Being Known, in this connection. Now Dewey is so candid about his assumptions and philosophical frame- work that the primary alternatives are discernible. To one who has fol- lowed from the beginning the perspective of instrumentalism it is evident that Dewey was obsessed by the conviction that modern philosophy got into an impossible, subjectivistic, mentalistic outlook which at once de- manded epistemology and made its success impossible. It is the old story of representative realism, of perceiving being reduced artificially to the apprehension of ideas. Dewey was not alone in this feeling of frustration, this sense of a blind alley. Objective idealists harped on the same string; and it should not be forgotten that Dewey began his career as an objective idealist. As I see it, then, Dewey decided to accept the biological framework for philosophy and to reinterpret knowing as a validating process within a reflective situation. To know is to validate. Perceiving is not a case of</page><page sequence="4">384 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH knowing in this sense although it may contain some funded information. It is more of the nature of a natural event. For such a framework there is really no problem of an external world. A kind of fluid natural realism is attached to biologism and behaviorism; and the whole outlook is blanketed with the term experience. I take this out- look to be a very logical one if the premise is granted; and that premise is that epistemology of the traditional sort represents a blind alley because bound up with Cartesian dualism. Woodbridge had the same general conviction. Now, as is well known, both the new realists and the critical realists denied this assumption. Both endeavored to re-analyze perceiving apart from traditional dualism; and both decided that, in perceiving, the percipi- ent was concerned with external things. The difference was that the critical realist held that such directed perceptual activity had a complex intra-organic, conscious ingredient of intent, sensory data, and judgment while the new realist denied this and sought to rescue naive realism. In many ways Dewey was nearer to the new realist. Both of them gave up as hopeless any attempt to re-analyze perception to make it intentional and mediated and to allow the perceptual experience to be existentially personal, intra-organic, judgmental. To Dewey that meant Cartesian dualism and the traditional intricacies of the mind-body problem. To the new realist it meant all the impossibilities of the copy-theory. Here was the watershed of the time in America. Critical realism involved an effort against the dominant current. It is easy to discern that Dewey's adoption of a biological framework and a kind of fluid naive realism had for its implication a rejection of tradi- tional problems such as that of the existence of an external world beyond sensory data, of perceiving as a low level of knowing of such an external world, of the relation of consciousness to the brain. These became pseudo- problems. Their artificialities were preconceptions of his outlook. It is equally obvious that, to the critical realist, none of these problems were false ones. And if he happened to be an evolutionary naturalist they were all pressing. It could not but be somewhat irritating if he were con- stantly told by pragmatists that all the problems he was spending so much time on were pseudo-problems. And then the positivists came along to sing the same chorus. Is this philosophical sense? Or is it a tour-de-force, philosophical escapism? Needless to say, I have doggedly stuck to the principle that perceiving could be re-analyzed in such a way that it could be regarded as a more or less symbolic, elementary level of objective know- ing and the organism could be considered minded and conscious. Such a view was naturalistic and had nothing in common with Cartesian dualism. It, however, broke with the new realism in that it refused to think of such</page><page sequence="5">DEWEY ON MATERIALISM 385 knowing as literally involving the intuition of the external thing, its given- ness to inspection. Perception would be more of the nature of a directed depiction-C. A. Strong's term-or cognizing awareness. In traditional language it expressed an attempt to push aside representative perceptionism and bring out the realistic intent of perceiving. II How should the term experience be used? In these matters I have a long memory and recall that, in the early days before realism had made its mark, when the pragmatists were accused by the idealists of drifting into subjec- tivism by their definition of truth as that which works, they promptly re- plied that the experience and working they had in mind was social expe- rience. But how, then, is experience related to consciousness? The reply was, in essentials, an allocation of consciousness to special conditions of awareness within experience. It should be recalled that James had set the fashion of looking askance at consciousness as something private, ghostly, or Kan- tian. It was the age of a neutral radical empiricism, an extraverted Humianism. A favorite expression of the times was to say that conscious- ness was a relation. External relations were the solvent of all difficulties. N-ow I do think that the term, experience, needs real definition. It often seems to signify a union of knowledge with its foundation in observation. It has quite an objective, cognitive significance. We talk of human expe- rience, scientific experience, personal experience. Taken in this sense, of course, we cannot transcend human experience. To think of doing so would be like trying to transcend human knowledge. But to the critical realist the query still remains: W~ho observes? What is the nature of observation? U pon what does experience rest? And what does it imply as to the nature of knowing? And so we come back again to the nature of perception. Dewey keeps, as we shall see, to his biological framework and his fluid natural realism. The critical realist has a biological framework also but has a different epistemological set-up. When the new realism hove into sight Dewey discovered that he was more of a realist than he had realized. I remember all this so vividly be- cause I lived next door to that aggressive and dynamic phenomenon called the Chicago School, for which, at that time, the earth was round or flat according to the era in which one happened to live. I dwelt over in the shadows at Ann Arbor and muttered to myself, like Galileo, but with as little effect. The contrast between knowing and being was overshadowed. All correspondence theories of truth were in the discard. They were sup- posed to vanish with representative realism.</page><page sequence="6">386 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH In making his adjustment to the new realism Dewey queried what he called its universalization of the cognitive relation. Perception, he held, is a natural event and not a case of knowing. Immediate experience is just immediate experience. The term knowing should be kept for problematic situations and defined as validating hypotheses. Now, of course, verbal definitions are arbitrary. But, as A. K. Rogers pointed out, we all regard perceiving as involving some measure of judgment and belief. When our attitude is dominantly practical, the judgmental element in perception may not be very conscious or explicit but it is there and operating, as we dis- cover when we find we have made a mistake. There are, I take it, degrees of explicit judging in perceiving but without an ingredient of denoting and judging we would have, at best, sensing and feeling and not perceiving. I would argue that Dewey makes too sharp a distinction between perception and the reflective situation due, I imagine, to his concern with scientific method. All levels and kinds of perceiving, from the practical and the almost auto- matic to the explicitly judgmental, run the danger of being, in some meas- ure, non-veridical, mistaken. Things may not be-to use Dewey's classic expression-as they are experienced as. It is the recognition of this element of claim or belief, of this haunting sense of an independent world which is perceived more or less adequately, that constitutes the problem of an external world. It was just an historical accident that it was theorized about in terms of a causal approach to perception, really a causal approach to sensing, as the critical realist has so often remarked. Now because Dewey-for the reasons I have already indicated-turned his back upon the reference of knowing to an independent, enduring physi- cal world from the level of perception upward, he really sought to ignore this apprehensive, disclosure, meaning of knowing and to shift attention to knowing as validation. It is this basic denial and shift which has driven his critics from Rogers and Lovejoy to Murphy frantic. Hence, the cur- rent talk about an antecedent reality which, after all, is only the physical world of common sense and realism. This point will be important when we come to consider the problem of the status of "scientific objects." While the critical materialist takes scientific objects to be literal ingredi- ents of the chairs and stones perceived, Dewey regards them as validated ideas within experience. It should be (deal b)y now why Dewey and the ontological materialist should not 1)e expected( to see eye to eye. But let the intellectual drama unfold. III With these essential p)relininaries, necessary to a proper perspective, out of the way, we can consider I)ewey's replies to Santayana, Russell, and</page><page sequence="7">DEWVEY 0N- MATERIALISM 387 1Reichenbach in the volume of the Schilpp series. Note that they all turn upon his definition of experience as "the manifestation of the interaction of organism and environment" and the "idea of experience as an interaction of organism and environment."3 Now, as a good naturalist, I have my sympathy with this definition. It points to the conditions and setting of human experience. But what kind of a manifestation of the interaction of organism and environment is experi- ence? Or is it the interaction itself? Dewey is quite awe are of the fact that the tradition which has dominated the use of the term in British empiricism, at least, and which is alive in his critics, is what he calls the traditional, mentalistic view of British psychol- ogy; that is, of Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and the Mills. And here he issues the inevitable challenge: How can those who hold a purely "subjectivistic" view of experience provide means for getting out of its charmed circle? In other words, what is knowing for them? For I do not suppose that Dewey demands any literal transcendence; that is, an existential transcendence, of a person's field of consciousness with its data, beliefs, concepts, judgments, and verbalizations. At least, he should not; but I fear that none of the pragmatists have studied recent movements in epistemology closely enough to realize that the critical realist does not proclaim that the organic self, in acts of con- scious denoting and describing the things around it, does literally reach out and include things. The shift has been, rather, to a clearer conception of what knowing is. While the new realist got out of the charmed circle of Lockian ideas by the adoption of the searchlight theory of perception, the critical realist decided that perceptual knowing is an affair of experienced denoting and symboliz- ing, a depicting and describing, and thus, an awareness of things, an aware- ness conditioned by stimulus and minded, conscious response. It is an awareness which is denotative, responsive, and guided by sensory appear- ances. It is noteworthy that the new realism, Dewey's pragmatism and critical realism all accept the same conditions of experience. But it seems to me clear that Dewey is nearer to the new realism with its rejection of an intra- organic, personal field of consciousness. His is a kind of fluid naive realism in which things are as they are experienced as and in which knowing is, as we have pointed out, shifted to the reflective situation and given a futuristic direction. I take it that he was so convinced of the impossibility of solving the traditional problems of external reference and the correspondence theory of truth that he wrote off as impossible, as a blind alley, the attempt to press on. It was so easy to convince himself, as Woodbridge did, that I Page 531.</page><page sequence="8">388 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH it was all bound up with Cartesian dualism, whereas it has no logical con- nection with it. What was really needed was a clearer conception of the organic self as minded and responsive and a realization that the distinctions and meanings discoverable in consciousness are intrinsic to, and reflect, these organic directions and activities. Like the new realists he took the easier path of a simple objectivism, but a simple objectivism of experien- tialism. Traditional problems, instead of being faced and solved, became pseudo-problems. As we all know, the positivists adopted the same proce- dure. It is magnificent, if you will, but is it philosophy? Since the mind-body problem will play its part in our study of reformed materialism, it may be well to call attention to Dewey's remark to the effect that "dependence of experience upon obscure occurrences in the inside of the organism certainly does cut experience off from intrinsic con- nection with environing conditions and render it a mere parasitic attachment to a private body."4 Now, I simply do not see the implication. Why cannot such personal experiencing be a manifestation within the organism of that interaction between the organism and environment of which he speaks? The reason why he speaks of this alternative as rendering it a mere parasitic attachment of a private body is that he had given up exploring it because it was in his mind linked up with all the traditional problems he was avoiding as pseudo- problems. After all, the new realists did the same. I, on the other hand, sought to reanalyze perceiving and also to face up to a far more difficult mind-body problem, the relation of a personal consciousness to a minded organism. It is this problem which takes one into the heart of ontology. Take another psettdo-problem on escaping which Dewey congratulates himself. My own conviction is that if you escape too many problems you will be escaping philosophy itself. And it has been my suspicion that it was precisely this that Dewey and the pragmatists have taught so many Ameri- can philosophers to do. In a foot-note on page 542 in which he is replying to Reichenbach he writes: "Yet I cannot refrain from saying that (as Reichenbach's Experience and Prediction clearly shows) upon his view the existence of an 'external world' is a problem for philosophy, whereas accord- ing to my view the problem is artificial generated by the kind of premises I call epistemological. When we act and find environing things in stubborn opposition to our desires and efforts, the externality of the environment to the self is a direct constituent of direct experience." I think the situlatiQn is more complicated than this for we must contrast our awareness of the self with the awareness of things to which we aie responding and wNe must determine the status of sensations. As I see it, I)ewey is once more falling back on his fluid naive realism, his experientialism. I Ibid., p. 530.</page><page sequence="9">DEWEY ON MATERIALISM 389 Dewey's attack upon the correspondence theory of truth is so well known that I need not linger upon it. He has a choice set of epithets for the kind of knowing presupposed. It is otiose, a mirroring, etc. Now all this ties up with his dismissal of the cognitive element in perception which I have already discussed. In the above adjectives he is just rationalizing this shift and his consequent dismissal of epistemology. Real knowing, he then goes on to say, is solving problems, validating ideas. You see, it all hangs together. The only way to answer Dewey is to show how a denotative theory of knowing can be developed for both perceiving and scientific description. Such knowing is referential, depictive, descriptive, and, of course, of practical value for handling our world. I need not here go into my formulation of a correspondence theory of truth.5 Suffice it to say that this is a critical issue. Do we have here another pseudo-problem? The alternatives are clear.' If propositions are not the mental instruments for expressing facts about the world and so giving cognitive disclosure of it, they may well be only plans of action within experience. If the former they may still be bases for plans of action. Let us turn now to the status of scientific objects. Their status has bearing on materialism. Dewey writes: "I return now to the connection which exists in my theory between the scientific, physical object and the qualitative, -experienced situation. For, according to my view of the latter, the definitely relational objects of science are produced when connections existing in the immediate situation are noted and formulated."6 Now the critical realist does not believe that scientific objects are pro- duced but, rather, that scientific concepts of the microscopic constituents of physical things are achieved. I would give existential status to atoms and electrons though I would not hold that we have adequate concepts of them as yet. Here is where my reformed materialism begins to appear. IV We can now see the alternatives before us pretty clearly. Either Dewey is right in his perspective with its rejection of epistemology or else pragma- tism is a sort of make-shift and its pseudo-problems are not such at all. If the latter is the case, we should expect ontological questions to have a reach and depth which pragmatism is blind to. There are four problems which can be used to illustrate this point. These are the problem of an external world, the correspondence theory of truth, the mind-consciousness-organism problem, and the question of the meaning 5 Those interested will find it in my Philosophy of Physical Realism and The Journal of Philosophy, November 30, 1941. 6Page 538.</page><page sequence="10">390 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH and status of substance. To the physical realist, all of these have a signifi- cance they cannot have for Dewey. Take, for example, the connection between the idea of an external, material world and the correspondence theory of truth. If you call the first sinnlos, you will be well on the road to casting a pitying eye upon the correspondence theory of truth. What is there for propositions to correspond to? And if you give up the correspond- ence theory of truth, a really external, material world tends to become ghostlike, unknowable, unthinkable. In this fashion, the two denials sup- port one another and a thinker must fall back, as Dewey does, into plans of action and mere temporalism. If, again, the external material world, of which the organic self may turn out to be a member, and the correspondence theory of truth are discarded, then substance likewise departs. It is then useless to explore such cate- gories as simple endurance, organization, and the emergence of new capaci- ties. In short, any meaningful development of an evolutionary and qualitative materialism is precluded. And, of course, with the vanishing of the category of substance any basic context for the mind-body problem disappears. The ontological depth of this truly profound issue is no longer apparent. All the pragmatist needs is to talk of functions of the organism, just as all the positivist needs to do is to speak of a double language. The reason for this is obvious. The organism is no longer a genuinely material whole; and consciousness is not an intra-organic complex of qualia. The full impact of the traditional mind-body problem ceases when a personal consciousness is rejected because it gets you into difficult problems in epistemology and ontology. The reformation of materialism lies in recognizing that consciousness is a "natural isolate" intrinsic to mind-brain activities. But then you are really immersed in both epistemology and ontology. Is it not clear that these four windows on fundamentals are so connected that he who draws the blinds down on one does it simultaneously on the others? And Dewey is quite aware that he has rejected all four as pseudo- problems. Are they? The physical realist emphatically denies the alle- gation. V As an ontology, materialism has had a checkered career. Our cultural history with its Platonism and supernaturalism has not been favorable to it. It was left, in the main, to the tender mercies of amateurs who reified classical physics or a purely mechanistic physiology. There was little philosophical finesse about it. It had in its armor little epistemological acumen and still less categorial insight. But, as I have already suggested, the time is ripe for a fundamental over-</page><page sequence="11">DEWEY ON MATERIALISM 391 hauling and reformation. Evolutionary theories have indicated the im- portance of emergent, or integrative, causality. The growth of naturalism has been a necessary preparation. But naturalism is not enough. A theory of existence is required, an ontology with all the paraphernalia of the categories. Just to utter the magic words, science and scientific method, is not sufficient. After all, the intention of the materialist has always been honorable. He could never see the evidence for immaterial things. A human being was, of course, complex and gifted; yet, when all was said and done, he was but a living, acculturated organism granted a brief span of years. And have not technical philosophers made even more inexcusable pronouncements in arguing that material things do not exist, that to be is to be perceived? I suggest that the technical philosopher should be willing to let bygones be bygones. There are some rather absurd skeletons in his romantic and anthropomorphic cupboards. VI After this lengthy, but necessary, preamble, let us return to Dewey and his refusal to go beyond an experiential naturalism. After recognizing that emotional causes often dictate preferences for one word over another, he proceeds to state his primary reason which turns out, as could be expected, to be his rejection of substance. This was already implicit in his treatment of "scientific objects" and in his neglect of a know- ing directed toward a material world. He remarks that he has been chided for not developing an ontology and replies that science is enough. I have attempted to show that his whole approach to philosophy practically precluded an ontology. "If" writes Dewey, "the term 'matter' is given a philosophic interpreta- tion, over and above its technical scientific meaning-e.g., mass until recently-this meaning, I believe, should be a functional relation rather than a substance. Thus, in case there is need for existential conditions in their function as conditions of all special forms of socio-biotic activities and values, matter might well be the appropriate word. But recognition that all these activities and values are existentially conditioned-and do not arise out of the blue or out of a separate substance called spirit-is far from constituting materialism in its metaphysical sense. For it is only by setting out from the activities and values in experience just as they are experienced that inquiry can find the clues for discovery of their conditions. Denial that the former are just what they are thus destroys the possibility of ascer- taining their conditions, so that 'materialism' commits suicide. It is quite possible to recognize that everything experienced, no matter how 'ideal' and lofty, has its own determinate conditions without getting into that generali-</page><page sequence="12">392 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH zation beyond limits which constitutes metaphysical materialism." Such is the essential part of his reply to Savery. But why is metaphysical materialism a generalization beyond limits? I suspect that Dewey has in mind old-fashioned, reductive materialism. Certainly any ontological materialism of today must be appropriate to the setting of evolutionary naturalism. It must stress relations, organization, levels. It must be willing to recognize new organic wholes with correspond- ent capacities, properties, and activities. In this sense it must be qualita- tive and permissive of differentiation. Again, no philosophical materialist would deny for a moment that, from the epistemological standpoint, we must take our point of departure from the experiences and cognitive claims of human knowers. In contrasting the theses of physical realism with Dewey's fluid experientialism, I have, I hope, made this clear. As Profes- sor Parker has admitted in his recent book, Experience and Substance, a materialism which proclaims an inside to nature and has a critical theory of knowledge and an evolutionary approach cannot be toppled over by dia- lectics. And so I am persuaded that ontological materialism of a reformed type deserves more careful examination than it has received. Nor should we be afraid of the category of substance which, after all, only stands for the recognition of existence, endurance, wholeness, executive capacity, relative independence. The human, organic self is substantial in this sense. Matter is dynamic and organizing in its own right. And now a word, in conclusion, about the present situation in philosophy, which I give for what it is worth. It is my feeling that there is much escapism and unwillingness to make an existential choice in academic philosophy. The stress is upon method and second intentions, much after *the fashion of a decadent liberalism. It is as though philosophy had ceased to be the handmaid of theology to become that of a wertfrei and agnostic science. I suggest that it again sink its teeth into epistemology and ontology. The era of the great refusal, the proclamation of pseudo- problems and the sinnlos, should be over. I welcome the fact that some phenomenologists are seeking to supplement their careful descriptions with considerations of the question of existence. While I have emphasized my divergence from Dewey and have not hesi- tated to declare why I thought his long attack upon epistemology has been most unfortunate, I cannot close without expressing my admiration for the intellectual and moral stature of the man and for all that he has accom- plished over such a wide field.: ROY WOOD SELLARS. 1 NIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.</page></plain_text>
