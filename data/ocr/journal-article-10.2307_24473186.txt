To underscore Sommer's warning that "pho Studies Workshop, concentrating on the relation between tography cannot afford an iconoclasm of ideas," I wanted to words and images, someone gave me a little book called The draw connections between Sommer's images and ideas and Poetic Logic of Art and Aesthetics, by Sommer in collaboration the writings on images and aesthetics by Italian Renaissance with Stephen Aldrich. It was an unassuming, plain little volume, philosophers Marsilio Ficino and Giambattista Vico; Benedetto with gray laid covers stapled over cream-colored paper, and no Croce's Aesthetic (1902) with Antonio Gramsci's commen images. The main text consisted of eight unnumbered pages taries; sections of Nietzsche's The Will to Power as Art with of aphoristic writing separated by as many blank sheets. On Fleidegger's commentaries and his Poetry, Language, Thought, the first page appeared these lines: and sections of Henri Bergson's Matter and Memory (1908), Words represent images: nothing can be said for which there is no image. Linkages between images exist a priori and are the logic of display. Linkages between words are the logic of grammar. Images can be named; linkages can only be displayed. Images and their linkages are states of affairs. Words and their linkages are propositions. Words occupy language structure as display of grammar: what can be said can be seen as represented image. To a young poet and philosophy student recently enamored of photography, this lapidary text arrived with the force of revela tion. I read it first as poetry, then as philosophy, then again as poetry. The poet Michael Palmer once noted that "aphorism is, when interesting, an aspect of philosophical skepticism. It relates to poetry because philosophical skepticism also has a lyrical and condensed character to it, as in Nietzsche or Wittgenstein, or at moments Derrida." Sommer's Poetic Logic was the most serious attempt I'd yet found to articulate a poetics of images that was both philosophically skeptical and lyrical. From that time on, I looked for an opportunity to engage 64 / www.aperture.org •ARCHIVE WORDS NOT SPENT TODAY BUY SMALLER IMAGES TOMORROW CONVERSATIONS WITH FREDERICK SOMMER BY DAVID LEVI STRAUSS</page><page sequence="2">no. 184 aperture / 65</page><page sequence="3">especially chapter 3, "Of the Survival of Images," with Gilles and drove two hours north to Prescott on the morning of Sep Deleuze's commentaries in Bergsonism (1966).

In our first talks, he was the same time his fundamental stance was one of resistant sententious and did occasionally resort to old scripts, and cer- and sometimes intractable difference, leading ultimately to rel tain well-worn turns of phrase that he'd obviously used many ative isolation. These two motivations were always in conflict, times before. But then he would catch himself, stop, and ask and this conflict formed the art—a fundamentally impure art, for another question. That first day he acted like an old man, in which one gets these tremendous contrasts, like extreme tapping his forehead when his memory failed, interrupting his innocence and the grittiest of experience. This is, I think, what speech periodically with "Now where was I?" or "What were Sommer meant when he said: "My things are not pure: they we just talking about?"

And this made it diffi gressed far enough that he asked me to return the following cult for those in the photographic establishment who preferred morning, when he would be fresh. resolution in their images to accept his work. The second day was very different. It soon became clear that In "The Linguistic and Pictorial Logic of General Aesthetics" he wanted to have a conversation, not an interview, but for that, (1979), Sommer wrote: "More and more people are realizing he needed to know the person he was that the coherent way of investigating talking to.

I found them extraordinary. When Sommer came into the room, I said: "Nothing you do is ever very far from the anthropomorphic." These collages are all a reconstitution of the human figure, and yet operate as new, freestanding organisms. Emmet Gowin said they all have to do with "leverage, rather than weight." Later, Naomi talked to me about Sommer's relation to his own body, about the elegant way he moved. He was remarkably agile for a man in his ninetieth year. I remembered then that this somatic elegance was something Sommer himself remarked on in regard to his two most direct and persistent artistic companions: Edward Weston and Max Ernst. The primacy of placement and position was not just a philosophical abstraction to Sommer. One day, as I was setting up the tape recorder and microphone between us on a low table, Sommer got up, moved his chair a half-inch to one side, and sat back down. Then he reached over and moved the microphone stand a quarter of an inch. As I watched him, I realized that a faulty arrangement—a bad composition—actually caused him physical pain. Sommer spoke about how Michelangelo often went a little beyond reality in his depiction of sinew and muscle to make the whole compo sition stand on its own. When I asked him if he thought Michelangelo was getting closer to the Real in this way, or further away, he said "the infinitely near is as far as the infinitely far." After our second conversation, Sommer asked if I'd like to spend some time looking through his library, since I'd mentioned it in my initial letter to him. I said I was very eager to do this. He pointed out that the books were arranged by size, not by subject (position being more important than occupier). I spent a good deal of time in subsequent visits going through Sommer's library and recording its contents. Some of the things I found confirmed my imaginings of sources and affinities—in German: Hegel, Freud, Nietzsche, Novalis, Holderlin, Heidegger, and Paracelsus; in Italian: Vico, Bruno, and Croce; in French: Nerval, Lautreamont, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Mallarme, Jarry (Oeuvres Completes in eight vol umes), and Valery; in English: Shakespeare, Donne, Blake, Hopkins, and Joyce. Then some surprises: Jean Paul Richter's School for Aesthetics, Borges's Selected Poems, Luts de Camdes, Johann Georg Hamann, the metaphysical vaudeville of Nestroy, and lots and lots of Leopardi. And the pointed absences, including any postwar American vanguard poetry. No Pound, Olson, Williams, H.D., Zukofsky, Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser, George Oppen, etcetera.

After I'd been pressing him on this for some time, he finally ended the conversation by saying: "I am not overawed by things that don't give me pleasure." It was only after that I remembered that Sommer had created the image of Charles Olson's Maximus. In the first book publication of The Maximus Poems, by Jargon/Corinth in 1960, Jonathan Williams had printed Sommer's image on the title page, with this note: "A word on the title-page device: this 'glyph' becomes Olson's 'Figure of Outward,' strid ing forth from the domain of the infinitely small; and, also, a written character for Maximus him self—the Man in the Word. It is (really, like they say) the enlargement of a sliver of perforated tin ceiling found on the floor of a bar room in a ghost town in Arizona. Frederick Sommer made the dis covery and the photograph." There were times when Sommerland seemed to me like a ghost town, and I felt like a premature historian, wandering around in the archives before the subject had quite left, picking up slivers and glyphs as he looked on, amused. Sommer told the organizers of a show in Delaware at about this time that they should treat him "as if I were dead." This was hard to do in proximity to a still very much alive Sommer. At one point he said to me: "You know, I'm going to be doing the ultimate disappearing act sometime pretty soon." When he did, in January 1999, we were left, once again, with nothing but the work, in words and images—marvelous discoveries in meticulous arrangements. Life is the most durable fiction that matter has yet come up with and art is the structure of matter as life's most durable fiction. —Frederick Sommer, The Poetic Logic of Art and Aesthetics © Untitled, drawing, 1944.
