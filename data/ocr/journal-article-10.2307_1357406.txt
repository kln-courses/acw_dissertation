<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amathus During the First Iron Age PIERRE AUPERT Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 11 Rue Jude F-33320 Eysines, France Amathus appears as a true city in Cypro-Geometric IB, at the dawn of the Iron Age, but its origins may date from the beginning of the 11th century B.c. Its prosperity in the Iron Age may be due, at least in part, to its location, which allowed it to control the Kalavassos mines. Its religion blended scarcely Hellenized Cypriot tradition with Syro-Palestinian tradition. From the Cypro-Geometric IB period on, the tombs contain many Phoenician, and later Euboean, imports attesting to increasing foreign relations. A Phoenician necrop- olis confirms the presence ofa sizable Phoenician colony. At the end of the Cypro-Geometric and in the Cypro-Archaic period, goldsmith shops produced remarkably cosmopolitan work. The existence of a Near Eastern type royalty, shown by recent excavations of the palace, reflects these influences. Despite the Greek names of the earliest kings, the politics of the kingdom was almost constantly pro- Persian, so the Archaic period saw greatly improved economic life, exemplified by the local goldsmith industry and rich deposits of local and imported ceramics. A mathus appears at a break in history, at a time when writing-which had existed in Cyprus since the 15th century B.C.-seems from the documents in our possession to have dis- appeared for a long period, although it may have continued on perishable materials. We can thus re- construct the picture of the earliest times only through the study of ceramic or terracotta objects and works of later ancient writers. The name of the city, whatever it may have been at the time (below), does not appear in the Cypriot cit- ies list found at Medinet Habu (ca. 1200-1175 B.C.), in which no town is mentioned in the space between Kourion and Kition. Furthermore, only one vase dat- ing from the Bronze Age has been discovered in the necropolis, in Tomb 15 of the Swedish excavations, which dates to the Cypro-Geometric period. It is a Red Polished I amphoriskos, of Early Bronze Age date, which might have been found somewhere else by the relatives of the deceased or might have previ- ously been in their possession (Gjerstad et al. 1935: 94). In any case, its presence in this Iron Age tomb cannot be regarded as evidence for Bronze Age oc- cupation at the site. In the same way, we can observe the complete absence of Mycenaean ware. The appearance of human beings on the site that was to become the city-kingdom of Amathus can be fixed securely only around 1100 B.C. This is the date of a small ceramic deposit (fig. 1) collected in an abandoned pit in the vicinity of the palace (Aupert 1978: 948-52, figs. 20-21). It could also be the date of a tomb discov- ered on the top of the acropolis, which might have been attributed later to Ariadne, as the myth would have it (Hermary 1994: 197-210). Since its layout is similar to those of other tombs from the Geomet- ric period, as its discoverer pointed out, its structure belongs to a typical Amathusian practice (fig. 2). It consists of a shaft dug into the rock and presumably covered by a slab. Indeed, the wall closing the sto- mion goes up to ground level, which would not have been the case if the chamber had been dug under- ground. This characteristic could explain the facts that no remains of collapsed roofing have been found in the chamber and that the whole is buried just a little under the surface of the rock. Consequently, the cover must have been made up of one or several slabs, which were most probably easily plundered. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 PIERRE AUPERT BASOR 308 rI \I i 77.355.7 77.355.8 77.355.18 77.358.27 77.355.21 ',,/77.358.29 ~~~77.355.43 7.5.

Wright 1992: 348-49). It can be found sporadically in the Bronze Age, but flourished in the earlier periods. Both this tomb and the Aphrodite temple site it- self provided a stone cupulae slab (fig. 3).

All these elements suggest that the first Amathu- sians were the descendants of an ancient population of the island. ETEOCYPRIOTS Our surveys show that at the beginning of the 1 1th century B.C. a few settlers arrived on the acropolis (fig. 4) of what later became a city called Amathus, the capital of a kingdom; they found an uninhabited site, which appears to have been deserted since the Neolithic Age. At that time, forests and bushes were covering the whole area again. This lonely situation fits well with the legend about the foundation of the town related by ancient authors. One of those authors, Pseudo-Skylax of Caryanda, at the end of the fourth Fig. 3. Stone cupulae slabs from the tomb (top) and from the sanctuary of Aphrodite (below). century B.C., called Amathusians "natives" (autoch- thons) and ten centuries later Stephanus of Byzan- tium calls them "Cypriots" (and thus, by implication, not foreigners who came to settle in Cyprus; Aupert and Hellmann 1984: 13-14). Thus the term "Eteo- cypriot" used today to refer to the insular popula- tions prior to the arrival of the Greeks and of the Phoenicians. Theopompos, the Greek historian (ca. 350-300 B.C.) is more precise: according to him, the Amathusians are "the descendants of the companions of Kinyras [the mythical king of primitive Cyprus], expelled by the Greeks who accompanied Agamem- non," on their way back from the Trojan war (Aupert and Hellmann 1984: 13). We still know very little about the first Amathu- sians. One fact that gives credibility to the legend is that up to the end of the fourth century B.c. the king- dom used two official languages, both found in the inscriptions: Greek and a language not only unknown elsewhere (a few elements have been found in Pa- phos), but also incomprehensible.

Thus we are inclined to attribute it to the primitive populations of the island, and conse- quently we also give it the name of "Eteocypriot." The fact that some other inscribed fragments have been found in Paphos-where Kinyras is sup- posed to have been born-and the fact that the main deity of Amathus is Aphrodite as in Paphos tend to give substance to the following version. The 12th century saw a number of events: troubles attributed to the mysterious Sea Peoples, the disintegration of the Mycenaean empire, the ensuing migrations of the Achaeans, and their progressive penetration into Cyprus (symbolized by the Agamemnon episode, the foundation of Salamis by Teucros, of Paphos by Agapenor, and of Kourion by the Argives). After these occurrences the Eteocypriot natives are thought to have withdrawn and regrouped in a region that had remained unoccupied during the Bronze Age and where even the neighboring palaces of Maroni and Kalavassos Ayios Dhimitrios disappeared around 1200 B.C. One of the problems raised by this reconstruc- tion is that there is a time lag of about a half- or a quarter-century between those events and the date (1100-1050 B.C.) of the oldest ceramics found dur- ing the excavations of the city; the future Amathu- sians may have gathered either in an intermediate settlement, which we could have missed elsewhere in the town, or they may have taken some time-for unknown reasons-before settling there. However that may be, the choice was good (fig. 4). The town dominates the surrounding lowlands. The rocky acropolis offers some defensive facilities and is near a small anchorage that allows trading possibilities to extend across the seas. The country inland provides agricultural, pastoral, hydraulic, and lumbering resources. The disappearance of the Ayios Dhimitrios and Enkomi centers, which controlled the copper mines of Kalavassos, probably allowed the newly arriving people to expand their influence into these neighboring territories; and these areas</page><page sequence="5">1997 AMATHUS DURING THE FIRST IRON AGE 23 became parts of the kingdom and brought consider- able wealth to it. GEOMETRIC PERIOD Religion The religious beliefs of the first Amathusians can be glimpsed only through a very few documents relating to religious context and local myths. It seems probable that they worshiped, as in Bronze Age Cyprus, a half-human and half-animal horned god and a fertility goddess. We have some traces of the god in the later images of priests wearing bull masks (fig. 5) and in the Cerast legend, whom Ovid noted as cruel horned monsters that Aphrodite had changed into bulls. The goddess, later known as Aph- rodite, may have been represented as a stone, as at Paphos, but also as a Minoan-type woman with up- lifted arms, as attested here by numerous figurines found in ancient tombs of the city. Some votive in- scriptions (a-na) on vases from the sanctuary suggest her name was Ana, a name that we can perhaps trace in the sequence a-na ma-to-ri, which could mean "the town of the Amathusians" in the bilingual in- scription ICS 196 (Masson 1983: 206-7). If this is true, the goddess would have given her name to the Eteocypriot city as Athena did to Athens. It is hard to decide whether this great goddess was already worshiped in the upper acropolis sanc- tuary. In a context where we have few remains of architecture and buildings, we found plentiful depos- its of ceramics dating from the eighth century B.C. The only structure seemingly contemporaneous with the first period is the tomb containing the cupulae slab. From the end of the Cypro-Geometric II, around 900-850 B.C., images of the Egyptian god Bes are also found in the tombs. This cult had major impor- tance and continuity until the Roman period. Of course, it is impossible to appreciate whether it is related, from the beginning, to an actual municipal sacred cult or to a personal belief of the inhabitants. Trading Relationship The main evidence we have about this first pe- riod of the city comes from the surrounding necrop- olis. The earliest tombs, dating around 1050 B.c., are furnished with a relatively high percentage of im- ported vases from the East, with numerous Phoeni- cian-shaped copies, and also with Aegean types of iron spits and knives (Karageorghis 1981: 148-53; Fig. 5. Limestone statuette of priest wearing a bull mask. Karageorghis and Iacovou 1990: 97-98). In keeping with the coastal location of the town, the Amathu- sians were undoubtedly already connected with the two centers that were both about to influence their civilization: Greece and the Near East. Nevertheless, the Amathusians developed their own handicrafts. Most of their vases were locally made, with calcareous clay already characteristically enriched with black sand inclusions from the Yerma- soyia river. The shapes of most of these vases belong to the common Cypriot products of the period, but were more rustic, like Syrian ware. Some shapes</page><page sequence="6">24 PIERRE AUPERT BASOR 308 express a peculiar, genuine taste, like the pyxides or some polychrome jugs (such as those from Swedish expedition Tomb 22), or anthropomorphic askoi and other vases in the form of figurines. After about 950- 900 B.C., Egyptian imports, such as scarab-shaped amulets and faience pendants, attest to the expan- sion of trading and shipping activities. Around 850- 800 B.C., the first Greek imports appeared in tombs, most from Euboea and some from Attica. Local paint- ers, responding to this new source, began to combine Greek-inspired human figures with the more typi- cally local animal figures. Finally, during this period emerges metal handicraft which produced golden headbands and, later, the remarkable works of the Archaic period. Phoenicians at Amathus During the Cypro-Geometric III period (ca. 850- 750 B.C.) the Phoenicians were settled in Kition. During the eighth century they were also present in Amathus, where a necropolis belonging to their civilization and dating to the end of the Cypro-Geo- metric period and beginning of the Cypro-Archaic period has recently been found (Christou 1993: 752; Karageorghis 1995). In addition, the most ancient in- scriptions that may have been found in the kingdom are Phoenician, and are said to come from Moutti Sinoas, a hill summit 10 km north of the town (Mas- son 1985: 43-44). If this is true, it would testify to a Semitic cult at an elevated location and, undoubt- edly, the existence of a population of the same origin. This may shed light on the problem of the city name as well. The lists of Esarhaddon and Ashurba- nipal, about 673/667 B.c., provide the names of the Cypriot kingdom capitals. Among them, however, no Amathus is to be found. Two of the names are not recognizable: "Nure" and "Kartihadast," a Phoenician name. The latter has sometimes been identified as Kition, but A. Hermary (1996) rightfully observes that Kition has always been known as "Kition" and never as "Kartihadast" (see also Sznycer 1995). If we consider together the Amathusian epigraphic doc- uments and the Phoenician necropolis, we get closer to a probable identification of Amathus with Karti- hadast and therefore a settlement of a Phoenician dynasty, which would have temporarily replaced the former Eteocypriot rule. This mixing of ethnic populations had some eco- nomic and cultural consequences. From an economic standpoint, the trading with Syria declined, probably because the Phoenician princes of Kition, and per- haps the Amathusian ones, favored trading relations with the Phoenician coast. Moreover, the appearance of sphinxes, lions, and complex scenes on vases and the introduction of double superposed bowls cer- tainly is rooted in this cultural setting. The appear- ance of the Phoenician god Adonis in association with Aphrodite also reflects this new context (Pausa- nias 9.41.2-5; Stephanus of Byzantium, s.v. Ama- thous). In any case, the first political regime of the final Geometric period city certainly was a Near Eastern type of monarchy (Petit 1991-1992: 5-17). At the very beginning of the Archaic period, all components of the peculiar history of the king- dom are already set: people claiming their original- ity but still open minded toward foreign influences, a dynamic economy allowing overseas coastal trade, well established crafts likely capable of exporting metallic products, and a strong eastern-influenced religion and political establishment. Throughout this period, production increases and reveals the pro- gressive growth of the population and of its eco- nomic affluence, which explains the flourishing of the next period.
