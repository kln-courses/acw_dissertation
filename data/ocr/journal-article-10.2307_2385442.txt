Illustrated; 678 pages. FF170. MARIE-THERESE BARRETT Temple University Japan VERA LINHARTOVA'S Sur un fond blanc ('On a White Background') is a critical anthol- ogy of ten centuries of Japanese writings about painting, many of which have never before been translated into a Western language. The book brings together a rich fund of primary sources on aesthetics, particularly valuable to those who do not read Japanese. It will also be of great interest to specialists, not only because of the author's choice of texts but also because of her critical approach and her inspiring overview of artistic movements and aesthetic trends. While the anthology proper starts in the ninth century with Kuikai's fundamental teachings on the use of images in religion, Linhartova' nevertheless analyzes the first Japanese written sources, Kojiki, 712, and Nihon Shoki, 720. There, as so often, a con- tinental influence is evident (references to yin and yang, for example), but typically enough the Chinese abstract Taoist cosmology is transformed into uniquely Japanese images and anthropomorphic descriptions of the landscape. In Nihon Shoki, refer- ences to craftsmen are to be found, the craftsmen-artists who would later form the schools typically organized on a strong hierarchical basis, perpetuate the master-pupil tradition, and maintain the harmony of the arts and crafts in contrast to the West. Even though covering the eight centuries from the Nara period to the Momoyama, the first part of the anthology is shorter than the second, which surveys less than three centuries, the Edo period. Up to the seventeenth century, Linhartova' explains, docu- ments on the theory of painting were scarce, and her extracts are taken mainly from literary and historical sources. Chinese writings were known from early times, but they do not appear to have attracted many commentaries until the Edo period, when a renewal of interest in China took place and Chinese artistic theories were studied sys- tematically by literati painters. In fact, throughout the centuries, Chinese influence penetrated Japanese culture and art to a greater or lesser degree. The title for the anthology is not, significantly enough, a Japanese original image, but rather the Japanese adaptation of Confucius's cryptic words in Analects: 'All painting is done on a white (or plain) background,' (huishi housu, J. kaishi koso), an expression similar to the Western idiom, 'Starting with a blank canvas.' The way in which the Chinese expression was adapted to Japanese may be seen as a symbolic exam- ple of the way in which continental influences were assimilated and transformed into Japanese aesthetics: the four ideograms of the original expression were abridged to koso, or 'blank background', and these two characters surprisingly became synony- mous with painting by the time Kano Ikkei wrote his Kososhu ('On Painting'), 1663. This two-part anthology is organized under evocative headings. The title 'Une image du monde et les premieres chroniques du Japon' is echoed and reversed in the follow- ing chapter, Le monde des images dans l'ceuvre de Kukai. Here the great Esoteric Bud- dhist master expounds beautifully how art helps express what is beyond words, 'the Ultimate Reality' that is 'totally formless and colorless', but which 'can be grasped through forms and colors.... What the sutras and commentaries say in a veiled or cursory fashion, images reveal with total clarity' (p. 44). Kuikai's metaphysical view of art is in total contrast with Tachibana Narisue's comments of the Heian period</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 517 in his Gato: Kokon Chomonja, 1254, presented here under the chapter heading La peinture en tant quejeu de sociktt: 'Painting is a stylized reflection of the shimmering spectacle of the world.... It is attractive to the eye, amusing for the mind. All in all, it is a pastime for moments of leisure' (p. 73) In this and every chapter, the author's methodology is to present, under the same chapter title, the original text first, followed by her own comments and historical re- ferences, a worthy scholarly approach even if it takes some getting used to. Her in- depth knowledge of Chinese sources is of great benefit to readers, who are given trilingual romaji references throughout the book, with romaji and kanji thematic in- dexes at the end. For instance, commenting on a passage in Genji Monogatari about painting, Linhartova' finds similarities with ideas expressed in the Chinese classic Huainanzi, 139 B.C., and shows that such a text would have been known in Japan at the time since it appeared in a literary inventory of the late ninth century. While she notes that Confucius's comment 'relax in the practice of the arts' is not dissimilar to the Heian approach, she titles the chapter on Zen painting Les pratiques qui menent a la perfection, quoting the monk-painter Sesson, who considered painting 'a tech- nique worthy of an ascetic' (p. 133), a way to reach enlightenment. The depiction of landscapes, or sansuiga, had been for Kuikai a futile activity when compared to the painting of mandalas and sacred figures. On the other hand, it became essential in Zen art, which is, in Linhartova's words, 'anti-iconic, even iconoclastic' (p. 158) toward traditional imagery. Sesshui's modest comment on one of his own stunning landscapes executed in the haboku, or splashed-ink, method, shows how the process was more important than the result. Painted in 1495 when the master was seventy-five and given to his disciple Soen as a parting gift, it combines image and words in typical fashion. Here the image (as readers can see in the illustration in the present book) is an abstract transformation of the ink splashes that Sesshui created on the paper, 'still not knowing the why and how of my work' (p. 131). Some fifty years later, another of his disciples, Sesson, expressed a similar Zen notion when he wrote that the impulse to paint 'escaped from the brush-tip in spite of the hand' (p. 133). Tohaku Gasetsu, Hasegawa Tohaku's re- flections on painting collected by a follower in 1592, reveals the continuation of the Zen tradition in the late sixteenth century. His thoughts show, too, how well Japanese artists knew the continental tradition, what their preferences were (Liang Kai, Mu Qi, Yujian, etc), and how they were able to free themselves from a slavish imitation of Chinese subject matter, technique, and format, Tohaku's 'Pine Trees in the Mist' being a prime example of the trend. As mentioned above, the Edo period saw a revival of Chinese influence in all fields, the development of Neo-confucianism, and, in the arts, the first systematic surveys of continental treatises on painting. It also marked, in the eighteenth century, the discov- ery of the Western illusionistic treatment of the painted surface, dealt with here in a chapter wittily titled 'Occident, une illusion d'optique'. Under the heading 'Variations sur des themes chinois', the author presents Kano Ikkei's Kososha, 1623, and Kano Yasunobu's Gado Yoketsu, 1680. The former is a compilation of Chinese classical writings on pictorial art that follows closely the fourteenth-century Tuhui Baojian. It includes famous texts such as Xie He's Six Prin- ciples; the first principle is gi-yun, or 'breath and resonance', a notion difficult to inter- pret but which, according to Linhartova', points to the relationship between painting on the one hand and music and singing on the other, as illustrated in the Indian Visnu-</page><page sequence="3">518 Monumenta Nipponica, 51:4 dharmottara, written in the fourth century A.D. Kososhu lists worthy topics and a variety of terms signifying 'painting' (ga, Ch. hua; tansei, Ch. danqing; koso, Ch. housu, etc), which Linhartovai attempts to define precisely. Both Ikkei and Yasunobu, as masters in the Kana school at Edo, seem to have compiled their Chinese antho- logies for the benefit of their students. On the other hand, Kana Eino, a Kyoto artist, turned to Japanese sources instead and wrote his Honcho Gashi in 1678, typical of the new kokugaku (or national studies) trend as opposed to kangaku (or Chinese studies). Eino mentioned the two styles of painting, the Chinese kara-e and the Japa- nese yamato-e, but did not compare them. Tosa Mitsuoki, however, a member of the school specializing in yamato-e, went further and analyzed the merits of the national style, declaring that it 'gives preference . . . to the transient, the immediate, while Chinese painting favors correct order and immutable laws' (p. 364). Another trend was emerging, though, in eighteenth-century Japan, and that was ranga, or Dutch-style painting. Shiba Kakan, the main proponent of Dutch studies, went as far as writing, 'According to Japanese or Chinese painting methods, one should never be able to represent truth' (p. 397). Truth, optical truth, was what the ran- gakusha were after. Their purpose was scientific and diametrically opposed to the nineteenth-century bunjinga literati artists, who turned back with nostalgia to China for their inspiration and wished to 'perfect themselves in spirit' (p. 543), a purpose not so different from Sesshui's and Sesson's. Art and history go through cycles, Linhartova' concludes, especially in Japan, where the concept of history measured in terms of imperial reigns does not foster the Western sense of continuous progression; it also means that past artistic trends can coexist hap- pily with new 'movements'. The Meiji period saw the various painting genres schemati- cally divided under two headings, yoga and nihonga. Opposing the two, as is usually done, is an arbitrary distinction if we consider that the same artists practiced both styles 'cyclically' or combined them 'syncretically'. With such acceptance of the past and the present, Japanese artists may show us the way to the future. Ver'a Linartova's Sur un fond blanc should become an essential reference for specialists in Japanese art, but it will also appeal to scholars of comparative Asian studies, art historians of any field, and the general public. The work is an original an- thology and an attractively organized survey with classified bibliography, thematic indexes, charts, and illustrations essential to the text. Quibbling over minor points in a work of such magnitude, which combines scholarly rigor, breadth of vision, and originality of style, does not seem appropriate. Since the anthology does not cover the twentieth century, we can turn to Isabelle Charrier's La Peinture japonaise contem- poraine, 1991, for the rest of the story. I hope that both books will soon be translated into English so that they may reach the larger readership they deserve.</page></plain_text>
