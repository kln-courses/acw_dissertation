Collins University of the West Indies From as early as the fourth century BC, philosophers have sought to de- construct the logic of myths. Plato, for example, systematically contrasted logos, or rational argument, with mythos.' By the third century BC, Greek scholars began to either repudiate the mythological tales altogether, regard- ing them as fatuous explanations for natural phenomena, or to interpret them symbolically, identifying the divine figures as natural elements and forces such as the sun and the wind. In an attempt to reconcile Greco-Roman polytheism with Hebraic theology, early Christian thinkers established a par- allel between the dogma of Christendom and the mythologems, that is, they interpreted the myths as religious allegories. This theocentric exegesis was ineluctable if mythos was to survive, particu- larly after classical Greco-Roman civilization went into decline and gave way to Christianity in the early centuries AD. The Olympians, by and large, were anything but paragons of virtue; Xenophanes, precursor of the Eleatic school of philosophy, contended that much of the degenerate anthropomorphic be- havior ascribed to the gods in Homeric and Hesiodic epics was unworthy of 1. In The Republic, Plato argued that the ideal commonwealth should exclude traditional mytho- logical poetry on the grounds that it was full of untruths. Plato himself, however, devised "stories" to explore such topics as death and the afterlife, which, in his view, fell outside the boundaries of logical explanation.

Renais- sance mythographics was grounded in this mediaeval practice, and in Calde- r6n's Spain, as elsewhere in early modern Europe, the prime function of myth was didactic: its purpose was to censure "passion" and commend "virtue." Until recently, critical appraisals of the plays in the Calderonian repertoire that are set in mythic times or rooted in mythologems were informed funda- mentally by the religio-allegorical mode. Moreover, since these dramatic works were meant to entertain royalty, the evaluations undermined any in- trinsic value in these pieces other than moral indoctrination or frivolous diversion designed solely for the delectation of the Hapsburg Court. This traditional approach, which reduces the dramatic and thematic dimensions of the works to a facile moral, accounts for the critical disparagement and neglect that the texts have suffered in the past. As William Blue observes: "Allegorical readings of these plays do more to destroy their depth, their variety, and their multiple meanings than the resulting aphorisms do to edify us morally" (126). These religio-allegorical readings do not only tarnish the aesthetic beauty of the corpus, but also suggest that the playwright was hide- bound by the conventions of his society. Even though many seventeenth- century writers favored a homiletic approach in their treatment of the Greco- Roman legends, the function of myth in Calder6n's theatre resists a discourse of catechetical allegorization. It is in this light that new research contends that while these spectacular fiestas provided pleasure to the aristocracy of seventeenth-century Spain, they did not indiscriminatingly champion the conservative ideology and absolutist political structure of the dramatist's day. This is what Margaret Greer denominates "Calder6n's mastery at juxtaposing a 'celebratory text of royal power' and a critical 'political text'" (Play of Power 104). Calder6n consistently adapts and rewrites mythos in significant ways. This is usually a very effective means by which he reveals his rejection of arche- typal ideals in his works. What is particularly novel and salient in the case of 2. "Homer and Hesiod have ascribed to the gods all things that are a shame and a disgrace among mortals, stealing and adulteries and deceiving of another" (11).</page><page sequence="3">Collins: SUBVERSIVE DEMYTHOLOGIZING IN CALDERON 277 Fineza contra fineza is the role reversal. Instead of the conventional mytho- logical drama in which the gods exact vengeance on a mortal, it is a human being, Anfi6n, caught up in a belligerent maelstrom of human passion, who successfully avenges himself on a goddess, unaided by any other divinity. In fact, he is the only mortal in the Calderonian repertoire to openly, boldly, and successfully declare war on a deity. This reversal of stereotypical roles conveys, in a very compelling manner, subtle undercurrents at the ideologi- cal core of the play. Therefore, while Fineza could appear to be a simplistic regurgitation of the traditional rivalry between the virgin (Diana) and the whore (Venus), there is a subversive power at work that could be easily over- looked if one were to fail to perceive the implicit texts created via the play- wright's subtle yet potent use of dramatic irony, as he deliberately and punctiliously undermines certain supposed truisms of myths that his society embraced. The tales of Diana, huntress queen of the Roman pantheon, and her en- counters with Actaeon and Endymion, are two separate stories from the cor- pus of classical mythology that are intricately interwoven in Calder6n's Fineza to provide the background against which the central conflict of the drama unfolds.3 In the classical story, and most subsequent chronicles of the same, Diana's metamorphosis of Actaeon into a stag is unchallenged, and she is venerated as the embodiment of chastity. In Fineza, however, the hunter-turned-stag is given a son, Anfi6n, who, in a bid to avenge himself of the death of his father, decides to extirpate the cult of the goddess, to the point that even the very memory of her becomes obliterated. The play opens with Anfi6n's routing of the army of Thessaly, where Diana is the patroness, and his resolute declaration of victory "a sangre y fuego" (2).4 With bellicose determination, Anfi6n, now King of Cyprus in his father's stead, vows that there will not remain for Diana: 3. According to classical mythology, after Actaeon saw Diana unclothed, she metamorphosed him into a stag; after which he was torn to pieces by his own hounds. Sources are at variance as to whether he deliberately or inadvertently looked at the nude goddess, but his story later became a cautionary tale against lasciviousness. The story of the love affair between Diana and Endymion ostensibly arose out of the association of the goddess with Selene, Greek deity of the full moon during the dynasty of the Titans, who later came to be identified with Diana. According to extant classical records, Endymion, a handsome shepherd of Asia Minor, was the mortal lover of the lunar goddess, who would descend at night to gaze at his beauty and to kiss him. 4.

He feels absolutely no trepidation of preemptive action on the part of the goddess and declares that he will depose her: "sin entrar en el temor / de que en mi su safia emplee / como en mi padre [...]" ( 375-77). In effect, Anfi6n does not allow his fate to be governed by external powers and influences, but rather by his libre albedrio. His actions undercut the Calvinistic concept of predestination and the philosophical theory upheld by the Neo-Stoics, that an individual's destiny was at the mercy of the stars, Fate, or the gods. In Calder6n's theatre, it is precisely this traditional, fatalis- tic human belief in portents and the desire to forestall them which in fact bring about their fulfillment, thus setting in motion the cyclical events un- derlying these plays.5 Anfi6n, however, transcends this cycle of "predictable action" and becomes, in Calderonian drama, one of the few characters to triumph over the gods and their prophetic powers. Thus, by sheer determi- nation and courage, the King of the Cypriots succeeds in dethroning Diana in Thessaly, and her priestesses renege on their consecration to her service. In light of the observation that the Diana-Venus animus is evoked in the play, one might assume that Anfi6n is fighting on behalf of the latter or that she is the source of his victory, particularly since he enthrones her in Diana's temple following his triumph. However, apart from the fact that this would make the play little more than a rehash of this legendary rivalry, Anfi6n makes it clear from the very beginning that it is a personal vendetta: 5. For example, Tetis (El monstruo de los jardines), in a bid to outwit the prophesied fate of her son, Aquiles, raises him in complete seclusion. Nevertheless, it is the very nature of this upbringing that securely seals his fate. Like Basilio (La vida es sueflo), Acrisio (Las fortunas de Andr6meda y Perseo), and Liriope (Eco y Narciso), Tetis inadvertently effects the fulfillment of the "preordained" lot of her child by striving to elude it.</page><page sequence="5">Collins : SUBVERSIVE DEMYTHOLOGIZING IN CALDER6N 279 [...] No quede piedra sobre piedra, y sea, porq[ue] mais presto me ve[n]gue, el gran templo de Diana el primero en quien empiece el incendio. (2-7; emphasis mine) Throughout the piece, Anfi6n consistently draws attention to the fact that he has been unable to expunge from his mind the tragic death of his father at the hands of Diana because of a "facil acaso leve" (338), especially since the goddess herself, in his estimation, had "succumbed" to sexual love in her encounters with Endymion. Moreover, Anfi6n's triumph could not possibly be attributed to Venus since at no point in the drama does she implicitly or explicitly proffer divine assistance in his dethronement of Diana. The storm in act two, which might be interpreted as a symbolic representation of cosmic war between the goddesses, cannot incontrovertibly, or even reasonably, be considered Venus's intervention on Anfi6n's behalf to foil the counter-attack by Aristeo. Calder6n makes this clear via the contradictory interpretations of the turbulence. Ismenia sees it as Venus's way of helping Anfi6n since she herself is an avowed enemy of Diana, while Doris sees it as Diana's retaliatory measure against Anfi6n (1726-78). Anfi6n remains unperturbed that either of the goddesses could be implicated and prepares for the onslaught. Even though Anfi6n's antipathy towards Diana and her worship springs entirely from personal motivation, however, it also determines his dramatic function in the thematic conflict posed in the play. In other words, he is used by the playwright to espouse the sympathetic ideology in the dialectic in which two distinct and ultimately disharmonious sets of values are juxta- posed, those associated with sexual love and those with enforced virginity, a theme that Calder6n explores in many of his dramas, uniformly causing the former to triumph over the latter. It is the courage and determination of Anfi6n that make him the perfect fit for the protagonic role in the piece; that is, he upholds the supremacy of human free will and love against the imperiously imposed chastity that service to Diana demands, and in this manner he becomes Diana's nemesis. Not only is the goddess of chastity dethroned by Anfi6n, but she is also "de-deified" by Calder6n, moves which vitiate her mythological status among the immortals and deny her any retributive power against the human king. She is divested of her ability to metamorphose and becomes, instead, the object of a metamorphosis greater than the one she had executed, greater</page><page sequence="6">280 HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2oo5 because it is effected by a mortal. Since she is stripped of any power to speak, act, or retaliate, by the end of Fineza, the divine Diana has been metaphori- cally metamorphosed into the same voiceless stag into which she had trans- formed Actaeon. Calder6n's Actaeon therefore receives the power of language to transmit his story, and divinity is silenced. Furthermore, Anfi6n's frag- mentation of the statuette of her is a metaphorical representation of, and retribution for, her dismemberment of Actaeon's body. The mortals may have been powerless in the mythological records, but in Calder6n's plays they are given a perceptible voice and are empowered; while deity, in contra- distinction to ancient beliefs and Renaissance poetics, is rendered impotent and the gods' words annulled. Additionally, even though tradition had transformed Diana into a proto- type of virtue because of her assignment in mythology as the goddess of chastity, punishing those who dared to betray her cult of virginity, in Fineza she is powerless against the priestesses who break their vow of chastity. This is contrary to classical mythology, in which her nymphs remain loyal in their devotion to her, even when confronted with death. Thus, in the same man- ner in which Diana caused Actaeon's faithful dogs to abandon him, her priestesses abandon her. The goddess's impotence is even more pronounced in the case of Doris, who, like Climene (Apolo y Climene) or the Hesperides (Fieras afemina Amor), is consecrated by her father at an early age to the goddess and her cult of celibacy. Doris, however, though a sworn priestess of Diana, and long before Anfi6n's triumph over the goddess, has been engag- ing in nocturnal trysts with her lover, Celauro. In effect, the dramatist under- mines the validity of Diana's claim to chastity since, ironically, defense of her cult comes from this same priestess who has been secretly contravening her vow of chastity, perhaps a quiescent analogy to Diana's own "affair" with Endymion. Furthermore, upon renouncing her dedication to the goddess, Libia, another priestess, makes a witty, yet significant, allusion to the cult to Diana as a golden chain: [...] que aunque se suele decir, que es cadena de oro con la que Diana prende, yque vale el oro en cadena, que se arrastra y no se vende? (440-44)</page><page sequence="7">Collins : SUBVERSIVE DEMYTHOLOGIZING IN CALDERON 281 In Calderonian plays, the image of the golden chain or gilded prison is usu- ally associated with service to Diana,6 and in likening the effects of this cult to being bound in dragging chains of unsaleable gold, Libia underscores its austerity despite the mythic exaltation and socio-moral glorification of it. The symbolism implicit in the allusion to chains establishes a link between the cult of chastity and slavery, pithily exemplifying the oppressive nature of this cult and dramatizing the centrality of this metaphor to the work. There- fore, even though the classical and later recalls of the story have invariably lauded Diana and disparaged Actaeon as licentious, Calder6n reverses the fate of the characters, and Ovid's dismembered victim becomes, in Fineza, the victor.7 The traditional Diana-Venus rivalry, embodied in the antipodal values that they embrace, is a significant part of the dynamics of Fineza, but the en- thronement of Venus in Diana's temple resists closure in a homiletic exegesis of the play. Therefore, even though the critical issue in the play might appear to be solely, or principally, the celebration of "pardon and forgiveness over vengeance and retribution" (O'Connor "Grammar" 141) explicit in the fineza contra fineza dialectic-where the characters, challenged in their personal sense of love and honor, demand more of themselves and ultimately confirm the life-giving force of Eros represented in the play by Venus and Cupid- Anfi6n's action foregrounds certain issues that are only tacitly alluded to in the work. These issues, nonetheless, are crucial to an understanding of the resolution of Fineza's dramatic and thematic conflicts. It is important to bear in mind, as Greer points out in "Bodies of Power," that: "Democratic socie- ties of the twentieth century often view ritual as empty, anachronistic behav- ior, but in the traditional European city, it was central to the competitive 6. See, for example, Apolo y Climene, verses 25-38, in which Climene laments the imposition on her of service to Diana ("Que me dexaissedes sola [. .] infausta prisi6n estrecha [...] ni dorada la cadena"); verses 954-1002 are similar. 7. In Calder6n's demythologizing of the classical myths, even great heroes are denigrated. Her- cules, for example, among the most prodigious human beings to be apotheosized in Greco-Roman mythology, is dehumanized in Fieras afemina Amor. Critics generally interpret this as just deserts for his negation of the omnipotence of Amor. However, there is a subtle yet forceful subtext in the hero's removal from his mythic pedestal. Because of his subjugation of Yole at the service of political and dynastic necessities, in his symbolic dehumanization and emasculation, Calder6n debunks the myth of masculine domination and power so intrinsic to the patriarchal thought patterns and power structures of Golden Age Spain; it is this masculine "force" which becomes the dehumanizing agent in the play.</page><page sequence="8">282 c- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2oo5 political process by which major urban groups defined the city's rationale and structure for internal and external consumption" (146). The debunking of Diana, and the general refutation of her sterile virginity throughout the work become, thus, an ingenious exploration of certain ideological and phil- osophical codes and beliefs-or "implicit myths"-that undergirded seven- teenth-century Spanish society.8 The dichotomy between the popular concepts of sexual love and chastity is the essence of the dramatic tension that informs the action of the play, and with the dethronement of Diana Calder6n implicitly challenges the right of any god, institution, or society to demand celibacy of a person when a natu- ral human need is to love and be loved intimately. This is encapsulated in Anfi6n's description of the demands of service to Diana as hateful and un- natural: "Deidad que en sus estatutos / contra naturales leyes / manda al aborrecimiento" (333-35). The thematic realities of the play therefore under- pin one of the most inconspicuous dialectics posed in the work: civil law versus natural law. The axis of tension between the representation of Doris on stage and the social realities of Golden-Age Spanish society is rooted in the clash of these dichotomous principles. While her father's decision to con- secrate her to Diana's cult of virginity is clearly sanctioned by civil law, the dramatist portrays Doris as dehumanized and objectified to the extent that she has no voice or role in this matter concerning her own life. She becomes, thus, an object of her father's patriarchal mores. The antinomic force be- tween Doris's natural love for Celauro and her life of enforced virginity is foregrounded in her description of herself as "quien mais la fiera tirana / esclavitud de Diana / en estos montes sinti6" (630-32). When juxtaposed to Doris's natural affection for the Thessalian general, this religion of chastity is, once more, undermined and depicted as unjustifiably inhumane. This is reinforced in the overt link between slavery and this cult, and even more vividly underlined in the adjective ascribed to it, "tirana," which accentuates its cruel and oppressive nature. Despite Doris's violation of both Diana's vow of chastity and her father's orders, her love for Celauro thrives and ultimately triumphs. By bringing about the contravention of the orders of all the father-kings who impose celibacy on their daughters in each of his plays, Calder6n condemns this 8. According to Waardenburg, the Greco-Roman legends are "explicit myths"; "implicit myths" is a term that refers to "particular and essential assumptions which give meaning to the life of an individual or community" (52).</page><page sequence="9">Collins : SUBVERSIVE DEMYTHOLOGIZING IN CALDERON 283 imposition on a young girl of a life-long dedication to virginity, even though this practice was glorified by myth and advocated by some in his society, such as the religious puritans. Convents, often homes for unmarried daughters of the nobility, were the most obvious and closest referent to this puritanism. That Doris's father, an apt representative of the dominant patriarch, imposes upon her his will that she remain celibate, points unequivocally to the subju- gated position of women in early modern Spain in the face of social laws and codes whose objective was to fulfill political and social imperatives at the cost of free will and natural desires. Therefore, the underlying dialectic concerns the fairness of commonly accepted and long-standing civil laws, insofar as they are incompatible with or violate natural law, and are contrary to the libre albedrio of the individual. Calder6n, in his demythologization of this masculine power and the excessive reach of patriarchy via the non-fulfill- ment of the mandate of Doris's father, is obviously casting a critical glance on the severe codes in his society that defined and governed the behavior of women and not that of men. As Don Cruickshank observes in his analysis of Amor, honor y poder: "It is an anachronism to see a writer born in 16oo as sympathetic to 'feminism,' but Calder6n's less than wholly attractive por- trayal of the king, added to his presentation of the successfully subversive Fl6rida, indicate that his views on the role of women were different from those which then prevailed" (98-99).9 It is in light of the above that it becomes significant that another of the authority figures that imposes chastity in the work is female-yet another tacit allusion to the religious context of chaste nuns. Ismenia, the priestess who attempts to surreptitiously restore the cult of virginity, represents on stage the embodiment of the austere and dour cult of Diana, even the god- dess herself. As far as Ismenia is concerned, the role of the priestess or woman is limited to that of living by Diana's sterile codes, an outlook fash- ioned by the traditional and religious characteristics of seventeenth-century Spanish morality. Therefore, her crafty but failed attempt to single-handedly restore the cult of Diana functions as an ultimate criticism of Spanish stoical morality, proving that it is a philosophy suited to a people enslaved. Instead of fortifying the soul, this rigid type of chastity, as decreed by moral theology 9. Frederick De Armas echoes this same view when he states that "Calder6n's plays show a deep sympathy for women and a special understanding of the difficulties and hardships which the social standards of the seventeenth century inflicted on them" (303).</page><page sequence="10">284 HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2005 and socio-religious dogma, kills it. This is cogently captured in Ismenia's own description of service to Diana as: [...] la opresa esclavitud de austera deidad, que quiere que a fuer de fieras vivamos montaraces y silvestres, siempre por selvas y bosques. (459-63) The above verses underline the inhumane peremptory demands of enforced chastity on any being. Therefore, unlike recent readings of virginity in an English Renaissance context, the sexual politics of Fineza do not suggest that virginity, which is consistently associated in the work with blind, dehumaniz- ing patriarchal practices, functions as a site of female resistance. This feminist understanding of virginity is difficult to reconcile with the textual and sexual dynamics of Fineza, in which virginity appears as sterile, barren, and oppres- sive, to the degree that it is the antagonic force in the work. Therefore, while the dramatist might not have been intent on impugning nuns, it seems all but clear that the actions of Ismenia are akin to those of the women who took virginity upon themselves and sought to impose it on other women as well, using it as a standard against which to measure the worth of a female. This is an attitude, both of the clergy and laity of post-Renaissance Spain, that is rooted in the religious mores of society. As O'Connor points out in "Calder6n y la censura," "el amor carnal contribuia al enflaquecimiento de la raz6n del var6n y a la debilidad de la pureza y prnictica de la fe cristiana [...] desde la perspectiva de la vida de los clerigos y religiosos dedicados a la virtud heroica definida por la virginidad y castidad" (164). In effect, in his literary representation and subversion of the Diana- Actaeon myth-succinctly encapsulated in the analogy the playwright estab- lishes between the cult of this deity and slavery-Calder6n also subtly chal- lenges one of the fundamental tenets of the Catholic church: chastity as the consummate expression of religious piety. Therefore, even though a priest and committed to celibacy himself, in his dethronement of Diana and en- thronement of Venus, Calder6n (unlike some of his Jesuit companions), expresses an appreciation of the Christian vocation to conjugal love. In es- sence, the dramatist subtly posits to the over-zealous religious orders of his day that sexual passion between a man and a woman is a pure and divine</page><page sequence="11">Collins : SUBVERSIVE DEMYTHOLOGIZING IN CALDERON 285 right that is equally as praiseworthy as the choice to be celibate. Therefore, the latter should never be imposed on any individual. In essence, in the debunking of Diana, Calder6n makes a mockery not of chastity or virginity per se, but rather of the fanatic fervor of those who idolized this ideal to such an extent that they made a religion of it and subsequently sought to impose it on others. Thus, with the de-deification of the goddess, the playwright ingeniously demystifies and demythifies the extremist and chauvinistic atti- tude of his post-Renaissance society towards celibacy. Ismenia's actions rep- resent those of the women who supported oppressive civil and social dicta, and stand, therefore, as a symbol of a social construct in which women, not men, repress other women. This seems to indicate that the objective of the playwright is not to inveigh against the male species, but rather against all types of oppression, in whatever form.10 In his deconstruction of the classical myth and the dismantling of the worship of Diana and what she is generally made to epitomize--both in myth and on the stage-the playwright also contends with those who advo- cated the abolition of the theatre on the basis of its dramatization of sexual love. Following the closure of theatres after the death of Felipe IV, antago- nists of the comedia, condemning what they deemed to be the sensual nature of this genre, were advocating the proscription of theatre altogether, or at the very least, the dramatization of romantic liaisons. As O'Connor observes in "Calder6n y la censura": Muchos de los participantes en la polemica sobre el teatro espafiol, espe- cialmente los oponentes religiosos, bajo el liderazgo de dominicos, carmeli- tas y jesuitas, expresaban una actitud hostil hacia el matrimonio y la practica de los derechos conyugales. Veian, con particular horror, la su- gerencia de que la dedicaci6n al amor conyugal pudiera ser compatible con la perfecci6n religiosa esperada de cada feligres cat61lico. (164) The enthronement of Venus in Fineza might well have been Calder6n's pithy and incisive retort to the censure of the comedia on the basis of sensuality, as well as to the puritanical belief of his day that conjugal intimacy is incompat- ible with devotion to God. In the celebration of intimate love in Fineza, 10. A different but equally important aspect involves state marriages imposed on infantas so as to further state policies. (See O'Connor's "Infantas.")</page><page sequence="12">286 HISPANIC REVIEW : summer2oo5 the dramatist (unlike the antagonists of the comedia and some of his Jesuit companions), posits that there is nothing immoral about the physical expres- sion of love or the comedia itself, which embraces this God-given right. It is within this framework that the tacit message to Queen Mariana, whose birth- day the play celebrates, becomes patent. In the interregnum that preceded the reign of Carlos II, she had delegated the affairs of the country to her favorite, the puritanical German Jesuit Juan Everardo Nithard, upon whose advice she had supported the closure of the court theatres (Diccionario En- ciclopedico 1022). Examined in this light, it is untenable to suggest that Calde- r6n was bound by the ascetic values of his society; it is simply that his criticisms of these values in his works are usually very subtle. Anfi6n's en- thronement of Venus's statue in Diana's temple, therefore, represents more than mere antagonism between the goddesses: it is symbolic of Diana's dour exigencies for chastity being replaced by love and the flowering of life-sus- taining goals, as symbolized in the marriages at the end of the play. Anfi6n tells the priestesses: troqueis ufanas y alegres sus vanas austeridades a regalados placeres de honesto amor (que tampoco soy tan birbaro que intente que los deleites de Venus sean no dignos deleites) (412-18) The playwright appropriates the King's response to Diana as a vehicle for the most explicit refutation of the antipathetic principle in the work, and as a platform for his own rejection of this desolate cult and what it signified for his society and insists-through Anfi6n (321-29) and the priestess-Libia, that the goddess herself did 'succumb' to sexual love. According to Libia: [...] no debe obligarnos voto en que ella misma nos absuelve el dia que del amor es c6mplice [...] (492-96) Calder6n might well have been expressing his sense of outrage that those who so harshly condemned carnal love and imposed unnatural restrictions</page><page sequence="13">Collins : SUBVERSIVE DEMYTHOLOGIZING IN CALDERON 287 on women, were often guilty of the very "sins" against which they railed, since transgressions of a sexual nature were not uncommon in the ecclesiasti- cal spheres of the playwright's time. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, insofar as it concerns the members of the Catholic clergy of this period, "the moral standard of many [was] very low, and the practice of celibacy not everywhere observed" (Kirsch). The text does not intimate that Calder6n is advocating the contemporary concept of free love or suggest that he is es- pousing free rein to sexual passion (this is the reason Anfi6n describes the pleasures of love as "dignos deleites" [418]), but rather that the decision to be celibate must be rooted in personal choice and should never be enforced by any religion, state, or institution. In Fineza, there is a clear refutation of Diana's sterile virginity in favor of Venus's life-confirming force, since the former is not associated with any positive form of chastity, such as that es- poused by Santa Teresa and the other mystic writers of the age, but instead, with the life-denying force of Thanatos. In the refutation of Diana's sterility in Fineza, the playwright also contests the spiritualized agenda and severe measures advocated by some during the Counter-Reformation, in their bid to thwart the heresy and schism in the Catholic Church. One has to examine carefully the intra- and extra-textual dimensions of the work in order to appreciate its subtle nuances. The date of the play, 1671, is significant not only with regard to the impending aboli- tion of the comedia, for it also marks a Protestant insurgence in Hungary taking place in the same year. It is in view of this fact that it becomes clear that Calder6n was subtly addressing the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, under whose auspices the play was first staged in the Viennese court. His empire was justified by the claim that, in the same manner in which the Pope was the vicar of God on earth in spiritual matters, so the emperor was God's temporal vicar. Hence, Leopold claimed to be the supreme ruler of Christendom by divine investiture, and was intolerant in his drive to crush Protestantism. He had treated Hungary with great severity following the pro- Protestantism uprising that same year (Diccionario Enciclopedico 857). There- fore, even though a Catholic cleric at this point, Calder6n does not appear by any means constrained by the narrow-minded outlook of some who fa- vored the Counter-Reformation or the harsh measures advocated both by the political and religious structures as a means of counteracting the Refor- mation. The Hapsburg rulers were usually likened to the classical gods, espe- cially in the opening loas of plays. However, the dramatist is suggesting here that, unlike Diana, they should not abuse their royal power or use it to "si-</page><page sequence="14">288 a- HISPANIC REVIEW : summer20o5 lence" the people whom they govern; thereby bringing to the fore the politi- cal dialectic of early modern Europe regarding the ostensibly dichotomous principles of ethics and royal absolutism. Calder6n's stance is clearly indi- cated in the play's dethronement of Diana. In essence, Calder6n creates his own mythopoeia, and the dramatic effects that his alterations elicit, at least in Fineza, are not reducible to Christian allegorization. Former criticisms levied at the myth plays of Calder6n, due especially to religio-allegorical interpretations of the same, are a fundamental misreading of the dramaturge's attitude towards myth and how he uses it in his works. Calder6n demonstrates a sophisticated appreciation of ancient myth as a fatalistic, pagan discourse that could be radically manipulated into a defense of modern and anti-mythological ideologies. In effect, he does not demythologize in the traditional sense of merely eliminating the mystical and mythical aspects of the story, nor does he, as might a modern theorist, remythologize by making the tales pertinent to contemporary life in order to show their underlying truths. Instead, there is an erasure and subsequent rewriting of the classical story in which the cyclical or closed notion of time and events of the typical mythological tale is expunged. Therefore, to the extent that Calder6n's treatment of myth is ahistorical, the concept of time that undergirds Fineza is an open one, shaped by the individual himself. Calder6n's exploitation of myth transcends even a more contemporary view like that of Richard Palmer, who, in his Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer, states that demy- thologizing is "the realization that we must see what it is in myth that is meaningful [and that] should, in principle, be the task of literary interpreta- tion" (251). In his decontextualizing and recontextualizing of the classical myths in Fineza, Calder6n criticizes certain fundamental codes of his society. He uses the classical Diana-Venus rivalry in Fineza, for example, as a back- drop against which to denounce the discriminatory statecraft that encom- passes codes and laws rooted in blind, dehumanizing, patriarchal, and unfair state practices that ultimately violate the rights of its subjects. In light of this observation, it seems wholly untenable to suggest that Calder6n, in his works, sought to champion the conservative ideologies of his day. In essence, there is a negation of the allegorical depreciation of Calder6n's more subtle use of mythologems in which the true focus of the work is not the mythical structure within which it is set, but rather the actions of the dramatis per- sonae.</page><page sequence="15">Collins : SUBVERSIVE DEMYTHOLOGIZING IN CALDERON 289 It is in view of the above that it becomes patent that the theatricalization of the antithetical values in the play is not a regurgitation of the legendary Venus-Diana rivalry, designed solely for the delectation of the Hapsburg Court. As is evident, though myth continues to be central to Fineza, its cyclic pattern is counterposed to epistemological order. Calder6n's use of mytholo- gems is not reductive to Christian allegorization, and Fineza contra fineza is one of the plays in the Calderonian repertoire that definitively redresses this notion. In essence, Fineza is poignant testimony that the dramaturge's use of myth works against, and is more complicated than, apologetic ideology. Works Cited Blue, William.
