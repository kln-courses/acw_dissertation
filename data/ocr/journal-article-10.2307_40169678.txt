<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abbeyi Country Paul W. Rea Desert Solitaire. Twentieth Anniversary Edition. By Edward Abbey. Illustrated by Lawrence Ormsby. Designed by Carol Thickstun. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1988. 255pp. $24.95 cloth. Edward Abbey died March 14, 1989 in Tucson, Arizona. This handsome new hardback edition of Desert Solitaire, featur- ing a new author's introduction and Lawrence Ormsby's intaglio prints, runs nearly verbatim with the original text. This printing brings the number of copies in print to 450,000; Desert Solitaire is becoming a popular classic. It remains the most popular book on the Southwest, and - despite its flaws - is probably the best single introduction to the canyon country. Emerging as it has on the twentieth anniversary of the book's original publication, this new edition occasions both a retrospective look at Desert Solitaire and a re-evaluation of the late Edward Abbey. The biographical details commonly listed by Abbey suited his persona well, suggesting his humor, irreverence, and irascible indi- vidualism. His father's Christian names were Paul Revere, he was born in Pennsylvania and schooled in - of all places - New Jersey. After moving southwest, he retreated to places such as Pariah, Wolf's Hole, and Oracle. He listed his religion as "paiute," and his politics as "agrarian anarchist." In 1944, while the war waged and young Ed awaited the draft, he scraped together enough money - some of it from his father - to bum his way around the country, especially the West. He was im- pressed enough to enroll at the University of New Mexico, where he studied philosophy and edited The Thunderbird, the student liter- ary magazine. Needless to say, young Ed did not squander this opportunity to goad the authorities. Since then, he spent his time writing, lecturing, sparking dissent against industrial "progress," Paul W. Rea is associate professor of English at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley where he teaches "Literature of the Environment."</page><page sequence="2">Abbey* Country ■&gt; 265 park rangering, and watching for forest fires. Abbey often quipped that he had not done "an honest day's work" in years. In the early 1950s, during his senior year at UNM, Abbey wrote Jonathan Troy. This novel is set in a small town in Pennsylvania; Abbey later called it "a teenage drama" and "a poor book."1 A couple of years later he published The Brave Cowboy. After a decade, this novel provided the basis for "Lonely Are the Brave," a disturb- ing film about a rebellious cowboy pursued by a high-tech posse. After these early successes, Abbey wrote "two or three novels that were rejected by dozens of publishers."2 In 1962 he published his third book, perhaps his first mature novel, Fire on the Mountain. In it, two characteristic themes emerge: the individual in conflict with institutions, especially the federal government, and the individual's need for rootedness in an unravaged land. In 1971, Abbey published Black Sun, a bittersweet love story involving an iconoclastic forest ranger and a "princess" half his age, plus Slickrock, a spectacular photobook done with Philip Hyde that contains some of Abbey's most impassioned writing. Later in the 1970s, Abbey followed with The Monkey Wrench Gang (1979), a popular rollicking eco-adventure tale; The Journey Home: Some Words in Defense of the American West (1977), and Abbey's Road (1979), another collection of essays. During the 1980s, Abbey continued to publish prolifically. His major works include Good News (1980), Down the River (1982), Beyond the Wall (1984), Rock Salt and Cherry Pie (1988), and The Fool's Progress, published in the fall of 1988. Reluctantly, Abbey undertook a ten-city tour to promote this last homecoming novel about a colorful character who, abandoned and unemployed, left Tucson to return home in the East. In a Denver bookstore Abbey quipped that Tucson is getting so crowded that "you have to stand in line to hold up a bank." Most of Abbey's admirers, however, agree that Desert Solitaire remains his best book, for it showcases the range of his talents. Abbey said that he copied it "out of some journals that I kept"3 1.

As reviewers noted at the time, the book is a paean to joyous living, sung by a voice crying both from and for the wilderness. However, it consists of much more than autobiographical nature adventures. Desert Soli- taire reflects considerable erudition, for it often alludes to figures such as Hume, Thoreau, Rilke, Neruda, and Everett Ruess. More- over, it presents a mix of genres, each of them done well. Relying on his highly individual style, plus a few recurrent images, Abbey was able to unify and integrate his nature writing, natural history, en- vironmental polemics, outdoor adventures, western tall tales, and even his novelistic interior monologues. Most readers of Desert Solitaire regard the book as first-person natural history, and rightly so, for when Abbey evoked the natural world, he did so memorably. Around the bend up-canyon poured a red snout of liquid mud, which seemed to mumble to itself as it advanced. Sliding greasily forward the snout of mud dashed against the undercut wall on the outside of the bend, wallowed over ledges and swung back to the main channel in the center of the canyon floor. The clear perennial stream which flowed there was sud- denly buried, extinguished. Swaying from side to side like a locomotive on uneven rails, the flood rumbled down upon the boy and the dead tree and everything else in its path. Dust sailed into the air as dirt crashed into mudbanks; cracks rip- pled like lightning over the surface of the alluvium, yawning wide apart as chunks and blocks and sections of dried out earth slid or toppled into the torrent. On the crest of the flood as it came, above the churning debris of bushes, vines, weeds, and logs, floated a delicate and rosy vapor, a fine pink mist suffused with the glow of sunlight. (87) This is literally and figuratively powerful. In such descriptions Ab- bey has come to his senses; they are completely engaged, obliterat- ing the self-conscious observer. In the new edition, Abbey dropped the original subtitle - "A Season in the Wilderness" - and it seems well that he did. As a park ranger he lived in a heated trailer, drove a government truck, used a shortwave radio, enjoyed running water, drank hot coffee and cold beer, and wrote by lamplight provided by a generator. Perhaps in taking the "wilderness" out of the title he hoped to avoid the petty</page><page sequence="4">Abbey's Country * 267 criticism that has plagued Thoreau, whose detractors often point out that he sometimes supped in Concord. One might have hoped that Abbey would, after two decades, also have attempted to reduce contradictions between principle and practice. Early in Desert Solitaire, he stated his credo. The personification of the natural is exactly the tendency I wish to suppress in myself, to eliminate for good. I am here not only to evade for a while the clamor and filth and confusion of the cultural apparatus but also to confront, im- mediately and directly if possible, the bare bones of existence, the elemental and fundamental, the bedrock which sustains us. I want to be able to look at and into a juniper tree, a piece of quartz, a vulture, a spider, and see it as it is in itself, devoid of all humanly ascribed qualities, even the categories of scientific description. (21) But only pages later Abbey moved right into personification, de- scribing "mourning doves whose plaintive call suggests irresistibly a kind of seeking out, the attempt by separated souls to restore a lost communion: Hello, they seem to cry, who . . . are . . . you?" (32) In fact, Abbey often first personified, then made excuses for doing so, as he did after the well known "pas de deux" of the mating gopher snakes (36). Perhaps, like Thoreau, Abbey enjoyed the perverse pleasure of irritating his readers with his contradictions. Perhaps Abbey never should have sworn off anthropomorphism in the first place, for however unattractive philosophically he may have found it, his ro- mantic tendencies and his pressing need to express himself made holding to it impossible. This head-versus-heart conflict humanized Abbey, endearing him to many readers. However, his contradictions - hobgoblins of small minds or not - reduced his credibility with many others. While Abbey would probably retort that he did not care to be credible as long as he instigated controversy, he could not dismiss the issue in the case of his "Polemic: Industrial Tourism and the National Parks,55 for here - in the most widely anthologized chapter from Desert Solitaire - he clearly intended to persuade as well as to provoke. Using his novelist's gifts for narrative, he framed his argu- ment nicely between two anecdotes, one about waiting for nature's glories - "On the program: rise of the full moon" - the other about</page><page sequence="5">268 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest being interrupted by two government surveyors, both fully com- mitted to paved roads and "progress." Most of his polemic is serious - his thesis is that machines must be banned from the parks - though he often spiked his prose with satiric humor. The parks, they say, are for people. Very well. At the main entrance to each national park and monument we shall erect a billboard one hundred feet high, two hundred feet wide, gor- geously filagreed in brilliant neon and outlined with blinker lights, exploding stars, flashing prayer wheels and great Byzan- tine phallic symbols that gush like geysers every thirty sec- onds. . . . Behind the fireworks will loom the figure of Smokey the Bear, taller than a pine tree, with eyes in his head that swivel back and forth, watching YOU, and ears that actually twitch. Push a button and Smokey will recite, ... in a voice ursine, loud and clear, the message spelled out on the face of the billboard: . . . THIS HERE PARK IS FOR PEOPLE. (71) This is the comic-strip burlesque that Abbey did so well, but his "Polemic" also displays his tendencies to polarize and oversimplify complex issues. Abbey was equally good in telling a western tall tale, as his chapters on "cowboys and Indians" suggest. Along with a cast of colorful losers, he enjoys playing cowboy, experiencing the "wild west" of yesteryear. However, his most memorable writing comes as he quests for "the Moon-Eyed Horse," evoking Faulkner's "The Bear." Something breathing nearby - I was in the presence of a tree. On the slope above stood a giant old juniper with massive, twisted trunk, its boughs sprinkled with pale-blue inedible berries. Hanging from one of the limbs was what looked at first glance like a pair of narrow trousers that reached to the ground. Blinking the sweat out of my eyes I looked harder and saw the trousers transform themselves into the legs of a large animal, ... [I] distinguished through the obscurity of the branches and foliage the outline of a horse. A very tall horse. Gently I lowered the canteen to the ground. I touched the rope and the hackamore bunched up inside my shirt. Still there. I took the pebble from my mouth, held it</page><page sequence="6">Abbey's Country * 269 in my palm and slowly and carefully stepped toward the tree. Out of the tree a gleaming eyeball watched me coming. I said, "That you, Moon-Eye?" Who else? The eyeball rolled, and I saw the flash of white. (144) With commendable skill, and with little external action, Abbey nar- rates his stalking of the wild horse; for a dozen pages he rivets his reader. At moments, too, Abbey's style turned completely inward. In rendering the altered mental state of a boy tripping on sacred datura, Abbey moves toward stream of consciousness. The dry sand, scattered with pebbles, seemed alive. The sur- face of the ground was palpitating softly, steadily, as if breathing. And each pebble, formerly so dull and sun- bleached, now shone like a jewel. He had never seen anything before so beautiful. He passed his free hand before his eyes and saw the bones glowing through his translucent flesh. . . . There was a bush. A bush growing out of the hard sun-baked mud. And the bush was alive, each of its branches writhing in a sort of dance and all clothed in a luminous aura of smoky green, fiery blue, flame-like yellow. (85) One does not expect such "psychedelia" in a local color saga. However, Abbey's interior monologue should not surprise, for Des- ert Solitaire exhibits a high degree of subjectivity. Abbey's longtime friend, poet Richard Shelton, rightly contends that "no character in any of his novels has the depth, the be- lievability, that absolute feel of a real person that Ed Abbey in Desert Solitaire has."4 There Abbey seems to tell all, one moment watching the clouds go by, then next stoning to death a rabbit which, as a park ranger, he is sworn to protect. Like his contradic- tions, Abbey's insistence on unbridled self-expression aroused con- troversy. Fellow nature writer and novelist Wendell Berry observed that The trouble, then, with Mr. Abbey - a trouble, I must confess, that I am disposed to like - is that he speaks insistently as 4. Richard Shelton, "Creeping up on Desert Solitaire? ibid., p. 69.</page><page sequence="7">270 + Journal of the Southwest himself. In any piece of his, we are apt to have to deal with all of him, caprices and prejudices included. . . . For me, part of the experience of reading him has been, at certain points, arguing with him.5 While Abbey's self-expression may have intrigued some readers, even to the point of creating a cult of personality, it also turned others off. In a world of bloated egos, such self-indulgence can cloy. Reviewers of Abbey's books have dismissed him as a pouting swag- gerer. Moreover, his cavalier self-disclosures, while often humorous, did not improve his rhetorical persona when he called for protection in the national parks. Abbey himself deplored "solipsism" in the book, and knew intel- lectually that human arrogance is a central problem, yet he seemed unwilling or unable to check his own ego. And this tendency bears literary consequences. In his chapter on Havasu Canyon, for in- stance, Abbey's focus falls predominantly on his own rock- scrambling escapades. Despite calling Havasu a "paradise," despite having spent five weeks there, Abbey never really celebrates its exo- tic glories. This said, one must still affirm that there was only one Edward Abbey, and that he contributed immensely to public awareness of the environmental issues facing the Southwest. As Richard Shelton observes, he "thunders like an Old Testament prophet denouncing the sins of a doomed people."6 His books sell in nearly every book- shop, park headquarters, and convenience store in the West. Ver- satile and irreverent as he was, Abbey seldom bored readers. Ranger Ed was the Great Curmudgeon, a writer with stubborn conviction and considerable talent. His Desert Solitaire amply fills a unique niche in American letters.* 5. Wendell Berry, "A Few Words in Favor of Edward Abbey," ibid., pp. 13-14. 6. Shelton, ibid., p. 67.</page></plain_text>
