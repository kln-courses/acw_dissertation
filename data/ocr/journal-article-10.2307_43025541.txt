Walter Hölbling Marking the centennial of the beginning of Friedrich Nietzsche's reception in the United States, this collection of essays offers a colorful critical map of (mis)readings of this influential thinker's ideas by U.S. intellectuals, cultural critics, writers, and philosophers proper. Eighteen essays illustrate the wide and quite divergent impact of Nietzschean thought on the western side of the Atlantic; they also testify to the difficulty, acknowledged in the editor's introduction, of adequately presenting its whole spectrum. We know that collections of essays are eclectic by nature, yet a volume whose title places literature before thought leads readers to expect at least an even distribu- tion of essays between these two fields. Somewhat unexpectedly, though, only six essays discuss the actual influence of Nietzschean ideas on U.S. writers, from Jack London to Eugene O'Neill and Ernest Hemingway; even more surprising is the fact that U.S. writers who started publishing after World War II are not considered at all. Two more papers discuss affinities between Nietzsche's thought and certain ideas of William Dean Howells (Jon-K Adams, "Moral Opposition in Nietzsche and Howells") and Henry James (Daniel T. O'Hara, "Contagious Appearances: Nietzsche, Henry James, and the Critique of Fiction"); convincing as the arguments of both contribu- tions are, one wonders why they are included in a volume on the reception of Nietzschean thought in the U.S. (A similar case is Julika Griem's article on "The • Poetics of History and Science in Nietzsche and Henry Adams"). Whatever the reasons for the exclusion of U.S. literature of the past 50 years from this collection, the explanation given in the editor's introduction -that "literature itself has largely withdrawn from dealing with Nietzsche and Nietzschean ideas [...]," with marginal exceptions such as Thomas Berger and Saul Bellow, and that "the 'new Nietzsches' of variously postmodern, poststructuralist, and deconstructionist bent are simply a property of the literary critics and theoreticians" (12) - is sorely in need of substantiating evidence and seems to reflect some editorial policy rather than actual developments in U.S. literature. True, few literary writers (including most of those discussed in this volume) explicitly choose philosophical systems as sujets of their works. But to simply shut out the impact of central aspects of Nietzsche's ideas on writers like Norman Mailer, John Hawkes, Ralph Ellison, and the whole generation of postmodernists (esp. William Gass, Ronald Sukenick, Thomas Pynchon, John Ashbery) is to ignore the very 'American' interpretations/appropriations of Nietzsche by recent and contemporary U.S. authors. Finally, one also would have expected at least one contribution discussing the transmogrification of Nietzsche's Übermensch into the ubiquitous Superman as the dominant mythical figure in U.S. mass culture. On the bright side of things, the merits of Nietzsche in American Literature and Thought are as apparent as its limitations. Hays Steilberg's "First Steps in the New World: Early Popular Reception of Nietzsche in America" provides a vivid and differ- entiated survey of the U.S. intellectual and cultural scene, in which the reception of Nietzsche in the years before H.L. Mencken's The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche (1908) was polarized between the vitriolic polemic in Max Nordau's Entartung (1892;</page><page sequence="2">Buchbesprechungen 253 Engl, transi. Degeneration, 1895), which portrays Nietzsche as a deranged demon, and Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche's hagiographie versions of her brother's life and work. Additional complications in the early reception resulted from the fact that the initial editor and the leading translator of Nietzsche's works, Alexander Tille and Thomas Common, favored a rather Darwinian reading of the text and also decided to start their edition with the publication of Nietzsche's very late works like Thus Spake Zarathustra , The Genealogy of Morals, The Twilight of the Idols , etc. (all published in 1896), thus depriving their contemporaries of the opportunity to follow the develop- ment of Nietzsche's philosophical thinking throughout his earlier writings. Given these conditions, it comes as no surprise that pro- as well as anti-Nietzsche sentiment in the U.S. focussed on social and moral issues derived from limited as well as filtered versions of the original: "masses/superman, " moralism/immoralism" entailing "order/ chaos," and on the question of whether a "German" philosopher's ideas were at all compatible with American ideals. As a result, popularized fragments of 'Nietzsche's' ideas were appropriated by leading U.S. opinion-makers for their own purposes across the board, ranging from archconservative sociologist Franklin Henry Giddings to radical leftist Emma Goldman. As Steilberg aptly concludes, the early reception of Nietzsche in the U.S. was not so much a contest about his philosophy but "over the ideological claim to the rights of interpretation" (37); the philosophical substance of his writing remained largely untouched. Before Manfred Stassen continues the chronology of U.S.-Nietzsche reception with an in-depth discussion of H.L. Mencken as first serious American disseminator of Nietzschean ideas ("Nietzky vs. the Booboisie: H.L. Mencken's Uses and Abuses of Nietzsche"), the reader is presented with the three essays mentioned in the beginning, by Julika Griem, John-K Adams and Daniel T. O'Hara. Each of them is highly perceptive in its own right and points out significant affinities and differences in the thought of Nietzsche on the one hand and, respectively, Henry Adams, W.D. Howells, and Henry James on the other. A possible reason for the inclusion of these essays in the collection may have been a certain proximity to Nietzschean themes and concerns; in the context of this volume they provide readers with elucidating discussions of the American intellectual tradition, and with the valuable insight that these three American authors, independent of - and, ultimately, quite different from - Nietzsche, had their own critical thoughts about the meaning of history, the progress of civilization, and the relation between authors and their works. Picking up the thread of U.S. Nietzsche reception proper, Manfred Stassen's essay, while appreciating H.L. Mencken's importance in propagating a more bal- anced and altogether more favorable view of Nietzsche, also demonstrates that Mencken had his very personal reasons for appropriating certain aspects of the German philosopher's ideas for his own critique of American mediocrity. Mencken had no problems adapting Nietzsche's thought to Theodore Roosevelt's patriotic "doctrine of the strenuous life," or to find in Nietzsche's three natural casts of men support for his own argument that "the negro [...] must remain, as a race, in a condi- tion of subservience" (105). Stassen's essay also makes clear that Mencken's eclectic and elitist version of Nietzsche's philosophy lent itself easily to exploitation by anti-German propaganda during both world wars and thus, in effect, contributed to the degeneration of Nietzsche's image in the U.S. to that of the creator of the "blond beast" and of the ideological forerunner of both Wilhelm II and Hitler.</page><page sequence="3">254 Buchbesprechungen The following six essays discuss Nietzschean ideas in works of American writers. Gerd Hurm's "Of Wolves and Lambs: Jack London's and Nietzsche's Discourse of Nature" is a highly perceptive analysis that offers a pertinent critique of Nietzsche's (and London's) androcentric discourse and, while attesting to affinities with London's Darwin- ian as well as racist and sexist opinions, also points out significant differences in Lon- don's views. As Hurm's readings of The Call of the Wild and The Sea- Wolf convincingly demonstrate, London challenges Nietzsche's conservative anthropology of natural masters and slaves with his own convictions that this hierarchy is a result of historical and economic conditions. London's socialist bent makes him reject Nietzsche's extreme individualism as an inadequate elitist position in modern mass society. Joseph C. Schöpp's essay "Cowperwood's Will to Power: Dreiser's Trilogy of Desire in the Light of Nietzsche" shows how Nietzschean ideas were put to quite different literary use. In tune with contemporary Dreiser scholarship, which begins to look beyond concepts of biological and sociological determinacy in the author's work, Schopp sets out to trace features of the Nietzschean Overman in the figure of Frank Cowperwood, Dreiser's hero in The Financier, The Titan, and The Stoic. A finely differentiated discussion establishes Cowperwood as the American equivalent and embodiment of Nietzsche's Overman who, in the course of the trilogy, reconciles crude financial power with the more sublimated and refined forms of intellectual and artistic empowerment. Pointing to affinities between Nietzsche's admiration for the Renaissance ("the last great age") and Dreiser's portrayal of Cowperwood, in the last volume of the trilogy, as residing in his Renaissance palace on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, Schopp persuasively argues for his conclusion that Cowperwood embodies Nietzsche's concept of infinite self-becoming in the service of Dreiser's attempt to t subvert the rigid system of contemporary American morals. A highly informative if somewhat meandering argument is put forth in the next essay, Kathryne V. Lindberg's "In the Name of Nietzsche: Ezra Pound Becomes Himself and Others;" in fact, Lindberg seems to have been aware that the two quotations from Pound's Cantos at the beginning and the end of her article may be too scanty a link for the wide range of issues addressed in between. Readers who expect an in-depth discussion of Nietzschean thought in Pound's work will be disap- pointed, as the essay deals primarily with Pound's years in England as a frequent contributor to A.R. Orage's eclectively progressive journal The New Age. In recom- pense, though, Lindberg provides a thoroughly researched survey of Nietzsche's reception by the group of British and European intellectuals - many of them Vorticists and Futurists - around Orage's The New Age. Pound's reception of Nietzschean philosophy was shaped in an atmosphere of critical exchange with the opinions of such diverse authors as, among others, T.E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, Anthony M. Ludovici, H.G. Wells, G.K. Chesterton, and Benito Mussolini, each of whom focussed on different aspects of Nietzsche's writings. Altogether, Lindberg's rambling discus- sion draws a very lively picture of the European reception of Nietzsche; what Pound made of all that remains a bit vague - but this may well come close to historical reality, as Lindberg, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, suggests toward the end of her essay: "Poundians remain innocent of Nietzsche and, the better sort of Nietzscheans innocent of the likes of Pound." (172) Intentional or not, the difficulties of tracing Nietzsche's ideas in works of literature become apparent in the following three contributions. Elmar Schenkel's "Dionysus</page><page sequence="4">Buchbesprechungen 255 and the Word: The Nietzschean Context of American Modernist Poetry (Cummings, Eliot, Stevens)" shows how pervasively and at the same time elusively the interplay of Dionysian and Apollonian elements in Modernist poetry manifests itself. Maybe it is Schenkel's often rather elliptic and suggestive discourse that leaves one with the impression that tracing the Dionysian may become a somewhat esoteric business. For instance, when talking of Wallace Steven's poetic universe in his "Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction" as one of Nietzschean "'inconstancy', a play between absence and presence, exile and return" (192), and then pointing out the "Apollonian and Dionysian polarities of winter and spring, day and night, real and imaginary" (192) - one cannot completely quench the suspicion that Schenkel's argument has moved from the poetic text to a rather generalizing if vaguely dialectic meta-level of binary oppositions that reveals more of the critic's frame of mind than that of the text in question. Similarly, to tie Cumming's frequent use of spring as a rejuvenating and Dionysian metaphor, as well as his well-known preference for the creative innocence of the child, exclusively to Zarathustra's similar views and not to contextualize these elements within the strong Anglo-American tradition of the 'child-philosopher' from Wordsworth to Emerson and Whitman to Mark Twain - this comes across as a somewhat eclectic instrumentalization of free-floating signifiers. In spite of several perceptive explicative passages that demonstrate Cummings's, Eliot's and Stevens's deep concern with the Dionysian and its non-rational, disruptive, creative, sensual and physical aspects, the reader may tend to adapt Schenkel's final quote from Wallace Stevens: "Perhaps / The truth [about Dionysus and Nietzsche and the three poets in question] depends on a walk around a lake." (193) Gerhard Hoffmann's contribution, "Eugene O'Neill: America's Nietzschean Play- wfight," has fewer problems in illustrating the philosopher's influence on the founding father of American drama, as O'Neill's interest in Nietzsche has been freely acknowl- edged by the author himself and documented by decades of criticism. After pointing to specific Nietzschean ideas in individual plays, Hoffmann focusses on three major points: 1) the gradual overcoming of the limitations of the world with the goal of becoming a Nietzschean "noble man," a "creator," and a "yea-sayer;" 2) Dionysian ecstasy as moments of "mysterious primordial unity" -though here one might com- ment again that momentary (Romantic) epiphanies may have more sources than Nietzsche; and 3) an affinity between Nietzsche's understanding of human conflicts as struggles between an outer mask and an inner being, and O'Neill's extensive use of masks. Given the use of masks as stock property of the stage since antiquity, this may be the least convincing affinity of the threesome. Hoffmann then goes on to more detailed interpretations of The Great God Brown and Lazarus Laughed as the most complete and intricate of O'Neill's experiments with Nietzschean ideas, and develops the argument that in his later plays O'Neill gradually parts ways with Nietz- sche: the playwright's growing emphasis on the necessity of "pipe dreams" and their opposition to "reality," as well as the importance that he ascribes to pity and forgive- ness, reveal significant modifications of Nietzschean models. A different characteris- tic of O'Neill's later plays, the foregrounding of language to a point that anticipates Samuel Beckett, goes unmentioned but would have complemented Hoffmann's concluding turn of phrase that differentiates between a Nietzschean power of hope (derived from the "will to power") and O'Neill's "hopeless hope" (217).</page><page sequence="5">256 Buchbesprechungen The last essay dealing with Nietzsche's impact on American writers, Christopher Kuhn's "Hemingway and Nietzsche: The Context of Ideas," also sets out to establish structural affinities between the two authors. While one may remain skeptical about any direct influence in patterns like paradox, chaos and suffering, especially in the work of an author who experienced World War I, Kuhn's elaborate discussion of Hemingway's understanding of the bullfight in terms of Nietzsche's concept of trag- edy reveals a number of interesting parallels in the understanding of both as artistic and, in different ways, cathartic communal rituals that give form to the confrontation of life and death, the ultimate Dionysian mystery. The final seven essays in the volume discuss Nietzsche's reception by U.S. philosophers, beginning with another very lucid and balanced survey by Hays Steilberg, "From Dolson to Kaufmann: Philosophical Nietzsche Reception in America, 1901 to 1950." We are reminded that none of the major U.S. philosophers of the early 20th century dealt extensively with Nietzsche's philosophy: W. James simply ignored him, while J. Royce appropriated him, and G. Santayana rejected him - all three on the grounds of his morals and supposed attempts to institute a new program of ethics. The ensuing discussion takes the reception of Nietzsche through Mencken, Paul Elmer More, Paul Carus, William Salter and George Burman Foster, and George Allan Morgan up to Walter Kaufmann's Nietzsche: Philosopher ; Psychologist , Antichrist (1950), which cleared the way in the U.S. for an unprejudiced view of Nietzsche and was the first attempt to understand Nietzsche within the terms of his own philosophy. In his critical assessment of Kaufmann's writings, Haysberg ac- knowledges this merit but also points to Kaufmann's (too) humanistic view of Nietz- sche and his creation of what has been called an "antiseptic" Nietzsche; yet , Kaufmann's own philosophical problems with Nietzschean thought, for Haysberg, "cleared the way for the next generation of scholars to enter the Nietzschean laby- rinth and discover many secret passageways that had heretofore remained unseen." (258) The exploration of some of these ways are the subject of Stanley Corngold's "The Subject of Nietzsche: Danto, Nehamas, Staten." Spicing his commentary with fre- quent references to the three philosophers' practical professional needs, Corngold's critical discussion is as illuminating as it is entertaining: he marks discrepancies in Danto's early and later (Nietzsche as Philosopher ; 1965; 1980) understanding of "the irresponsibility of Nietzsche's style" (267); questions Alexander Nehamas' attempt (Nietzsche: Life as Literature , 1985) to establish unity in all of Nietzsche's work by making Nietzsche's exercise of style the goal of his life and work, applying two incompatible - anthropomorphic and literary - concepts of character in this more Apollonian view of the philosopher; and pinpoints central problems of Henry Staten's frequent equation of the elicited motives in Nietzsche's text with the inspiring motives of the writer, in his Nietzsche's Voice (1990), which applies "psychodialectical" Freudian and LaPlanchian categories. Corngold's critique, which remains construc- tively benevolent throughout, centers on the fact that all three authors attempt to establish a coherence in Nietzsche's writing that tends to exclude one of the very essences of Nietzschean thought -the continuous deferral of absolute meaning. Another four contemporary American philosophers are discussed in the following four essays. Olaf Hansen's "Stanley Clavell Reading Nietzsche Reading Emerson" weaves its topic into a framework of references that includes Parmenides, Sextus</page><page sequence="6">Buchbesprechungen 257 Empiricus, Hume, Kierkegaard, Carnap and the Vienna School of analytical philoso- phy, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Austin, as well as Poe, Melville, Thoreau, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Admirably as Hansen's encyclopedic knowledge is applied to the task of illuminating affinities and various flows of influence, the argument occasionally leaves some loose ends in the author's attempt to demonstrate on a mere 15 pages how Clavell tries to recapture Nietzschean moments of timeless contemplation in the works of American writers and find "the path of well-rounded truth, of unconcealment" (Parmenides) for his America, "the clearing where Being and thinking belong to- gether." (294) Lutz Ellrich places his "Richard Rorty's Pragmatic Appropriation of Nietzsche" in the context of Rorty's anti-deconstructionist pragmatist tradition and delivers a pertinent critique of Rorty's attempt (and its necessary failure) to appropriate Nietzschean concepts of contingency for his own models of the private realm of individual self-creation and the public realm of mutual accommodation. Following this anticipation of the deconstructionist reception of Nietzsche, Manfred Pütz's "Paul de Man and the Postmodern Myth of Nietzsche's Deconstruc- tion of Causality" convincingly deconstructs de Man's (mis)reading - in his "Nietz- sche's Theory of Rhetoric" -of Nietzsche's views on the "phenomenalism of the inner world," and its subsequent appropriation for his own ends. Pütz provides an in-depth discussion of both Nietzsche's early (mis)reading of Kant on the causality of phenom- enon and effect and of de Man's eclectic transformations of Nietzsche's genealogical understanding of causality (as only partially resulting from language) into de Man's view of language as a medium of ineluctable rhetoricity and figurality. The last essay dealing with an individual U.S. philosopher is Hubert Zapf's carefully titled "Elective Affinities and American Differences: Nietzsche and Harold Bloom." The lines of argument in the essay are as differentiated as the wording of the title, and Zapf's hermeneutic-comparative approach successfully develops central affinities while revealing the specific American quality of Bloom's creative adaptations of the Nietzschean heritage. In particular, Zapf emphasizes Bloom's re-consideration of Nietzsche not only as a philosopher of meta-textual deconstruction but as one grappling with truth and ethic values, and contextualizes Bloom within American Transcendentalist concepts of the sovereign self. The final contribution to this volume, Robert Ackermann's "Nietzsche Ground Zero," sounds a highly appropriate note: differentiating between a "vacuous" (circular) hermeneutics that always proves what it sets out to find in a specific text, and a hermeneutic spiral that proceeds on a serious interplay between textual detail and global textual meanings (358), Ackermann sets his sight on several severe misreadings of Nietzsche in the contemporary United States. His targets are, first, the publication of a graduate student denouncing Nietzsche as a relativist; second, an established psychologist who accuses Nietzsche of being an anti-relativist positivist; third, Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind , which makes Nietzsche and his alleged relativist atheism somehow responsible (together with other obscurantist "Germans," notably Freud, Marx, and Weber) for the ignorance of American students; and fourth, Richard Rorty's Philosophical Papers (1991), where he -as Lutz Ellrich's essay has shown in more detail - appropriates certain aspects of Nietzsche for his own philosophy. Ackermann's critique of applied vacuous hermeneutics in these four examples is relentless yet to the point; it is also highly adequate to the subject of this</page><page sequence="7">258 Buchbesprechungen volume, as it demonstrates once again that Nietzsche's thoughts "are dangerous because they require new thinking about cultural superiority, and they require new concepts with which to express that thinking." (367) Nietzsche in American Literature and Thought , with its wide range of opinions, is stimulating evidence of the continuing search for these new concepts.
