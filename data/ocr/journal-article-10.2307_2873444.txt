<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUSTEN'S PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND HEGEL'S "TRUTH IN ART": CONCEPT, REFERENCE, AND HISTORY BY CLAUDIA BRODSKY LACOUR I: HISTORICISMS AND NARRATIVE It is a truth generally acknowledged, that narrative is in need of a new form of analysis. A field of study that not very long ago seemed coherently defined and self-contained is presently undergoing histor- ical change, as interpretative activities of an avowedly partisan stamp all but replace the structuralist and semiotic pursuit of a formal poetics or "science" of narration. The leading notion of a generative "grammar," of a single syntactic pattern abstractable from every narrative text, has been succeeded by a hyperrealist investigation of narrative context; the truth of the archive, the labyrinth of quotidian detail, has come to command the kind of belief previously accorded to indexical charts and geometrical paradigms, the spare outlines of Chomskian trees and Greimasian rectangles. Characterized as a change in conceptual models, this shift conforms to a traditional picture of the history of modern literary criticism, and may indeed appear typical. On closer scrutiny, however, a less familiar theoretical complication emerges, setting this picture askew if not altering it altogether. For the current change in the focus of narrative interpretation also involves a significant shift of reference, a turn from the concerns and terms of literary theory to theories of history. This movement may be viewed in turn as a translation between theoretical genres, or, more often the case, as a closer approximation of literary studies to the real. But the interpretation of narrative fiction by way of contextual data organized according to concepts originating in the- ories of history sets into motion a considerable theoretical difficulty resembling in certain fundamental respects a vicious circle. At the level of methodology, the shift from the study of the specificity of literary form to the pursuit of a truth embedded in specific historical content inevitably engages the interpretation of narrative in an am- biguous conceptual relation to narration itself. The theoretical writings that have served as cognitive models or supports for the contextualist ELH 59 (1992) 597-623 C 1992 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 597</page><page sequence="2">approach make this ambiguity conspicuous. For those theories that have largely encouraged new historicisms of literature often rely in their own conceptualization of history on some version of narrative form. Foucault's layered narrative of successive perceptual "ages" iden- tified with homogeneous and hegemonic doctrines of "representation," and Lyotard's speculative tale of the metahistorical "grand narratives" that have served to "legitimize" cognitive and political practices come to mind most obviously as widely diffused examples of theoretical narration whose explicit conceptual aim was to provide a truer un- derstanding of history, and so of the present, by taking the form and content of narration to task.1 In attempting to merge empirical with theoretical or epistemological interests, contemporary historicisms that seek to dispute the claims of historically delimited, ideological fictions derive needed leverage from narrative form and narrative representation. Within the course of ab- stract formulations aimed at elaborating a general conception of history such ambivalent discursive practices are entirely understandable, if not indeed inevitable, and it may only be in their own claim to operate without narrative means that some current theories of history can most accurately be considered "new." But contextualist studies of literary narrative that take up a "post-narrative" historical stance manifest this ambivalence in a different, more literal manner, directly displacing their own field of reference from textual details to external events, from the already-narrated, tainted by the "fictions" of history, to non- literary, historical narration. Such efforts at reconceiving the past or of rediscovering history as it is at once excluded and suggested by literature are less interpretive than they are like narratives themselves, alternatives to, or fresh historical explanations of, stories no longer viewed as merely formal or innocent fictions. In the place of stories once relegated, along with problems of concrete narrative analysis, to the empirically slippery category of artistic expression, appear stories credited with telling the truth about nonfictional agents and occur- rences. In substituting the object of historical reality for the repre- sentations of literary fiction, contextual studies of narrative fashion other narratives with claims to new referential accuracy. Thus it is that, on a second level of actualization, the turn to empirical, archival history remains - if in displaced form - literary. The new historicisms, like the old historicisms, conceive of history and narrative as reflected in one another, whether it is the right or the left hand of history that writes the text. The same hand, however, fashions an infinite variety of artifacts, 598 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="3">all the made phenomena, self-representations, and fetishes a culture throws up. In this regard contextualist critics may have taken another theoretical cue from the program of an overarching Kulturkritik de- veloped by Adorno, without distinguishing, as Adorno himself gen- erally did not, the literary from any other kind of artifact.2 While Adorno's own purely theoretical writings (on dialectic, epistemology, and aesthetics) were more thoroughly enmeshed in the conceptual logic of idealist and critical philosophy than those of any other phi- losopher of cultural history since Hegel, his writings on literature tended to take the literary less, so to speak, at its word, demonstrating little of the same admirably excessive attention to problems of artic- ulation.3 That conceptual rigor Adorno reserved for the language of critical philosophy, revealing the social contagion of culture always about to become kitsch.4 But, as consciously post-philosophical as post- narrational in orientation, new historical or contextualist critics who similarly consider narrative fiction as but another specimen of general cultural production lay no such claim to a rigor dependent -as Adorno never failed to recall -on a concept of "objective," because negatively constituted, "truth."5 Their inclusion of narratives and narrative form within a defined field of cultural givens thus operates quite differently, effectively raising narrative to the level of reliable historical evidence and reducing it to the reflection of a transhistorical truth, the tauto- logical (Adorno would say vulgar) power of power to distort perception. Unlike dialectical analyses, the contextualist interpretation of narrative may ascribe either a naively mimetic or a subtly complicitous intention to the historical author. But since all authorship, inscribed a priori in history, is conceived to reiterate preexistent relations of power and authority, the interpretative result in either case is an affirmation of discursive culpability, a strangely anthropomorphic view of literary form most frequently expressed in the question of what narrative (a or any narrative) is up to. Here it is the critic of ideology whose gaze indicts as it defines, ultimately miming the self-legitimizing techniques of surveiller et punir. Yet, to gaze is not to read, and to judge narrative is to misjudge literature. By switching the verdict on narrative from (aesthetically) innocent to (ideologically) guilty, proponents of contextualist literary criticism continue to measure the promise of truth in discourse against the writing of fiction, and thus remain within a historiographic tradition which, younger only than the writings of Thucydides, is as old as the conventional division between empirical and conceptual history. Con- temporary historical criticism continues to enforce conventional no- Claudia Brodsky Lacour 599</page><page sequence="4">tions of discursive truth by opposing empirical history to narrative literature in particular, because narrative more than any other dis- cursive form seems to imply a conceptual manipulation of the empirical, a misrepresentation of the real toward the end of constructing a co- herent fiction. Inattentive to the links between truth and fiction formed at every moment by the discourse of narrative fiction, contextualist narratives and appropriations of narrative attempt to distinguish the truth of their own representations, whether factual or theoretical, from the distortions of literature. In so doing they pile fiction upon fiction, telling a story about story-telling, a story in which narrative itself already stands convicted of iniquitous activities.6 II: HEGEL'S HISTORY OF "TRUTH IN ART" A closer look at individual narrative constructions routinely wreaks havoc with the contextualist protocol. While almost every narrative can be retold as a series of events, it is only at their most superficial level that narrative fictions may be equated simply with the stories they tell. The hybrid language and dynamic character of narrative call for more complicated forms of analysis, just as the lived experience that historical writings strives to represent literally seems to call forth all the verbal complexity and formal precision of representational lit- erature.7 Finally, it is in this interaction of history with its verbal analysis that the path of contextual criticism proves most circular. For if the truth of a fictive representation is to be located in concrete historical detail, such detail must first be abstracted, for theoretical reasons, from its empirical context. The privileging of concrete par- ticulars outside the fiction may yield a theory, which, in seeking to avoid nonreferential abstraction, generalizes the particular. More than any other theory of history, Hegel's philosophy attempts to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis of the general and the particular. His dialectic describes thought in general as the translation of the particular into the absolute. But, for Hegel, that general translation must also be concretely perceivable. The particular objects which, for Hegel, concretely embody and reveal the general are the fictions of art. As the "sensory embodiment of truth" art precedes both religion and philosophy in Hegel's universal history of spirit.8 If, as Hegel famously remarked, "art in its highest determination is for us a thing of the past" (1:25), it is also the beginning of the future of all specu- lation-of religion, of philosophy, and, ultimately, of the overcoming, in absolute spirit, of thought. A theory of art which argues that its fictions make thinking possible by first particularizing the general in 600 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="5">concrete form, must itself begin by clearing away theories of art which make thinking impossible, in that they conflate or isolate the abstract and the concrete. In the section of the Introduction to the Aesthetics entitled, "Sci- entific Modes of Treating the Beautiful and Art" [Wissenschaftliche Behandlungsarten des Schtinen und der Kunst], Hegel juxtaposes his dialectical thesis that "truth" is "revealed in the sensory form of art" (1:82) to two already existing and "opposed modes" of treating art [zwei entgegengesetze Behandlungsweisen]: On the one hand we see the science of art concern itself only externally with real works of art, classing them chronologically in art history, offering observations on the work of art at hand, or sketching theories which should provide the general point of view for judgment as well as for artistic production. On the other hand we see science independently relegate thought about the beautiful to itself, thought that only brings forth the universal, an abstract philosophy of the beautiful which does not touch upon the work of art in its particularity. Insofar as the first of these is concerned, which takes the empirical as its point of departure, this is the necessary path for those who wish to educate themselves as art scholars . . . In this view each art work belongs to its time, its people, and its environment, and depends especially on historical and other repre- sentations and aims . . . the individual nature of the work of art is related to the particular. (1:29-30) Hegel notes that, while they originate in the historical and the particular, these considerations of concrete works of art give rise his- torically to more general "theories of the arts." Such "theories" may have much to say "im einzelnen" - "in specific" -but, Hegel observes, they become "very trivial reflections" once translated from the "narrow sphere of the work." In their universality, they "progress to no de- termination of the particular, which is, after all, the first business of theory of art [um welches es doch vornehmlich zu tun ist]" (1:31). Over the course of their own history, then, historical treatments of art come to resemble their opposite, that second mode "which strives to rec- ognize the beautiful as such," considering objects "not in their par- ticularity but in their universality" (1:39). Hegel argues that this ab- straction -"the ground of an abstract metaphysics" beginning with Plato -"no longer suffices. We must grasp this [idea of the beautiful] deeper and more concretely, for the contentlessness [Inhaltslosigkeit], which clings to the Platonic idea, no longer satisfies the richer phil- osophical needs of our spirit today" (1:39). Claudia Brodsky Lacour 601</page><page sequence="6">"Today," according to Hegel, the spirit demands another way, a path of reflection which "contains mediated within it both these ex- tremes, in that it unites metaphysical universality with the determi- nation of real particularity" (1:39). This way is Hegel's aesthetics, a historical theory of art that doubles as a theoretical history, the spec- ulative tale of symbolic, classic, and romantic phases in which art forms develop so as to "disclose the truth in art": the particular as prelude to the universal. It is also, however, before Hegel, the way of Austen's Pride and Prejudice, a fiction of the universal pretensions of the par- ticular which, as a fiction, rings changes upon the order of Hegelian history. A narrative fiction, it also marks a change in literary history, a dialectical moment when literature becomes identified with the his- torical and the particular, the representation (or misrepresentation) of the real classified chronologically by literary scholars as "realism." III: "REALISM" HISTORICALLY Before the categorization of "realism," the relationship between the concrete and the abstract-the basis of "truth in art" for Hegel-was the particular linguistic focus of early modern fiction. In eighteenth- century "realist" fictions by such experimenters in prose as Richardson, Diderot, Rousseau, and Goethe, the real is the heterogeneous reality of narrated lived experience. Such fiction we now classify as "psy- chological," as less intent on representing objective reality than giving voice to personal subjectivity. This retrospective judgment of course is indebted largely to the first-person format of early realist fictions: journal, dialogue, and epistolary novels that purposefully avoided the third-person vehicle of traditional epic, mock-epic and romance.10 The third-person narratives we now identify as realist appear to circumvent the problem of subjective versus objective narration by representing subjectivity "objectively" as a function of "character," a quasi-empir- ical, describable feature. But before the fiction of objectivity became equated with realism, first-person realist fiction represented not sub- jectivity as such but the recognition that realism in narration could only begin by representing reality as it was experienced. The primary activity narrated in early realist fiction is the act of articulating ex- perience itself, an act combining sensory immediacy with linguistic mediation, discursive understanding and imagination with incompre- hensibility, and which effects the actions of the fiction, its story, rather than the other way around. Early realist fiction is "true" to life neither in its power to represent historically delimited "truths," whether deemed subjective or ideological, nor in the level of referential accuracy 602 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="7">with which it represents an empirical object world. The distinct cat- egories of truth and reality meet explicitly in the composition of early realist fiction in the only manner in which they meet in reality, which is to say, in the mind's composition of experience. But if truth in early realist fiction has everything to do with the mental activity of narration, the translation of realism from the first to the third person must introduce another means of representing the truth of experience now attributed to conventionally fictitious, reported individuals. On one level third-person realism displaces the process of articulating experience imitated in first-person realist fiction by conceptualizing its own representations in the articulate form of a plot; events draw their meaning not from the conceptual acts narrated to produce them but from the part they play in a narrated story, much as the writing of history gives narrative shape and meaning to events attributed to the reported dead. But in general third-person realist narrative replaces articulation with representation, conceptual spec- ulation (now limited to stylized interventions of the narrative "voice") with description. To call such narrative "omniscient" or "authorial" is a convenient shorthand for saying that it already knows the reality it represents, as opposed to the immediate vagaries and urgencies of experience its characters may fall prey to. Representing its own om- niscience through techniques of emplotment and description, realist narrative written in the third person introduces another dimension and problem of fiction. For such realism would be the fiction of knowing everything about a fiction about which nothing really needs to be known. IV: ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE LANGUAGE IN AUSTEN The historical transition between first and third-person narrative fiction, between speculative and representational realism -and the attendant difficulty in reconceiving the category of truth in fiction- are central to the works of Richardson's most important literary de- scendant, Jane Austen. The very titles of Austen's completed novels reveal the division between notional and concrete language in her understanding of narrative realism, dividing, as it happens evenly, between abstract nouns (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Persuasion) and the names of particular people and places (Nor- thanger Abbey, Mansfield Park, and Emma; the uncompleted works, Lady Susan, The Watson, and Sanditon, are also named for fictive particulars). The specific problems involved in relating these two kinds of language -in representing "persuasion," for example, in the form Claudia Brodsky Lacour 603</page><page sequence="8">of a realist or nonallegorical story-were never directly addressed by Austen. But the difficulty of translating between abstract and repre- sentational language by way of narration and thus of representing an abstraction, truth, in fiction, pervades the structure of the novel often regarded as her purest success." More than any other work by Austen, Pride and Prejudice gives free rein to the powers of conceptualization, and it is just this continuous conceptual motion of the novel that Austen considered its structural defect. In a celebrated letter to her sister Cassandra of 4 February 1813, she criticized the recently completely Pride and Prejudice for the very qualities that would make it the most popular of her fictions: The work is rather too light, and bright, and sparkling; it wants shade; it wants to be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense, If it could be had; if not, of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott, or the history of Buonapart6, or anything that would form a contrast, and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness and epigrammatism of the gen- eral style.'2 Pride and Prejudice, Austen fears, may be overrich in its own verbal brilliance, the quickness and levity of wit that have come to characterize her writings as a whole. For like the curt articulations of opinion that are the hallmark of her dialogues, Austen's narrative voice is often viewed as too knowing, too consistently ironic in tone, her novels (with the possible exception of Mansfield Park) as lacking in a regard for the hard facts of reality and moral responsibility of art.13 In her letter Austen mocks just such a criticism of her fiction, one which esteems that, in order to be read seriously, novels must incorporate kinds of writing which they are not: "an essay on writing, a critique of Walter Scott, or the history of Buonaparte." Yet Pride and Prejudice, she reflects, may be so much itself as to impede the reader's "increased delight." In the absence of any objective "contrast" -whether "a long chapter of sense" or "of solemn specious nonsense" -the displays of quicksilver wit that comprise the predominant verbal mode of the novel may be so "sparkling" as to divert the reader from appreciating the "general style" of which they are a part. Three years later, such an appreciation of Austen's style was written by the same author whose writing she suggested be critiqued so as to provide the wanted contrast to her own. In a review of Emma written shortly after that novel's publication in 1816, Walter Scott drew a general comparison between Austen's fiction and the history of the 604 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="9">novel from which it departs. Most important for the present analysis is his discussion of Austen's realism, which he describes as a freeing of the novel from the constraints of its "original style," the represen- tation of the "extraordinary" it inherited from romance: In its first appearance, the novel was the legitimate child of romance; and though the manner and general tone of the composition were altered so as to suit modern times, the author remained fettered by many peculiarities derived from the original style of romantic fiction.... [T]he reader expected to peruse a course of adventures more interesting and extraordinary than those which occur in his own life, or that of his next-door neighbours.'4 The new style of Austen's fiction recalls the "course" of one's "own life" on two related levels for Scott: as a structured series of mimetic actions ("the studied involution and extrication of the story"' 5) and as internally ruled experience. Not only what people do but how they themselves conceive their actions compose the scope of the reality Austen represents according to Scott. It is this added dimension of internal comprehension, including, for the first time, the real conse- quences of misapprehension or mistake, which forever separates, in Scott's analysis, the new novel from the old. I quote from his description of romantic fiction at length because it provides, point for point, a perfect contrast with Austen's own: [T]he second broad line of distinction between the novel, as formerly composed, and real life, [is] the difference . . . of the sentiments. . In the serious class of novels, the hero was usually A knight of love, who never broke a vow. And although, in those of a more humorous cast, he was permitted a license . . . still a distinction was demanded even from Peregrine Pickle or Tom Jones. . . The heroine was, of course, still more immaculate; and to have conferred her affection upon any other than the lover to whom the reader had destined her from their first meeting, would have been a crime against sentiment which no author ... would have hazarded, under the old regime.... We, therefore, bestow no mean compliment upon the author of Emma, when we say that, keeping close to common incidents, and to such characters as occupy the ordinary walks of life, she has produced sketches of such spirit and originality, that we never miss the ex- citation which depends upon a narrative of uncommon events. . . .The narrative of all her novels is composed of such common occurrences as may have fallen under the observation of most folks; and her dramatis personae conduct themselves upon the motives and principles which the readers may recognize as ruling their own and that of most of their acquaintances. The kind of moral, also, Claudia Brodsky Lacour 605</page><page sequence="10">which these novels inculcate, applies equally to the paths of common life. 16 Like the new combination of mimetic with conceptual action (pro- ceeding by "motives and principles") in Austen's fiction, Austen's "orig- inality," as described by Scott, sets new standards for our perception of the original. With Austen, originality in prose fiction is no longer a matter of invention but rather a mode of representing the common- place as it had never been comprehended before, of affording the reader a new medium for "observ[ing]" and "recogniz[ing]" "real life." The idea of originality in recognition may seem a regressive view of innovation in fiction, but only if one underestimates the power of recognition that is meant. According to Scott, the force of recognition that Austen's fiction effects may be so comprehensive as to invert our conception of mimesis itself, making the fiction appear the model for the real, as he illustrates by way of an anecdote relating to Pride and Prejudice: "A friend of ours, whom the author never saw or heard of was at once recognized by his own family as the original of Mr. Bennet, " 17 and we do not know if he has yet got rid of the nickname. Fictions that are novel in that they are styled on "real life" rather than "romantic fiction," fictions that would be unthinkable under the "old regime" of romance, may read in fact-which is to say in our actual experience of them -as if they weren't novels, or fictions, at all. Lesser wits than Mr. Bennet will be no less recognizably rendered, with the result, Scott complains, that "their prosing is apt to become as tiresome in fiction as in real society. "18 That is to say, instead of experiencing Austen's fictions as artistic or aesthetic objects conven- tionally expected to afford pleasure, we may experience them with mixed feelings, the feelings of pleasure and displeasure with which we experience living. In a later discussion of Pride and Prejudice (a journal entry of 14 March 1826), Scott's appreciation of Austen's ability to achieve "truth" both of "description" and of "sentiment" leads him to regard the reality of the author's own life with just such felt am- bivalence: That young lady had a talent for describing the involvement and feelings of characters of ordinary life which is to me the most won- derful I ever met with. The Big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going, but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me. What a pity such a gifted creature died so early!'9 606 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="11">V: AUSTEN'S HISTORY OF AN IDEA To say that, unlike the ever-popular "Big Bow-wow strain" in fiction, Austen's fictions represented for the first time popularly recognizable "truth," is to ascribe a very serious purpose to the novel Austen created and to set the realist novel even further apart from any notion of prose literature as pleasurable diversion, a notion typified, traditionally and to this day, in the forms of historical epic and romance.20 It is to say that general knowledge may be abstracted from the fictive represen- tation of particulars, that part of the "real life" early realist fiction represents is the experience of cognition. Yet Pride and Prejudice, Austen's tour-de-force of the life of the mind, was faulted by her for just that mental skillfulness, its cognitive flair. Pride and Prejudice, Austen suggests, may appear to present no obstacles to the mind's power of illumination, to cast no shadow where it reflects, to contain no sense of gravity at odds with the novel's levity-nothing which would stretch or extend the fiction by holding the mind in place. The sharp succession of thoughts the novel narrates may appear devoid of any particular weight, and that lack of substance or of seriousness is in fact the first impression the novel gives.21 For how can we take seriously a novel which begins by speaking about universal knowledge as follows: It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in pos- session of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.22 Not only the claims made by Walter Scott about the special signif- icance of Austen's novels -the distinct moment they constitute in the history of narrative fiction because of their "truth"-but the universal claim made contemporaneously by Hegel, that the relation of the abstract to the concrete in art embodies the relation of truth to history- both these claims, covering very different registers, make the opening of Pride and Prejudice a matter of some theoretical note. Why should a novel ostensibly about the gain of knowledge -that is, the recognition and overcoming of the errors of perception signified by the abstract nouns, "pride and prejudice" -begin by making light of knowledge as these first words of Pride and Prejudice famously do? Such a question may seem out of line with the apparently ironic tone of this opening pronouncement, which reads less like the beginning of an omniscient realist fiction than the preface to a domestic comedy based on the propositional philosophy of David Hume.23 But it does address the Claudia Brodsky Lacour 607</page><page sequence="12">peculiar imbalance of sense that this purposefully mundane reference to a "universally acknowledged" "truth" -unlike a universally acknowl- edged truth-effects. While truth provides the ground of knowledge, this statement destabilizes the concept of truth, producing not knowl- edge but the effort to attain it, which is to say, with Hegel, history. For the imbalance between concept ("truth") and reference ("a single man in possession of a good fortune") enacted in Austen's opening sentence provokes another kind of action, one that unfolds specifically in time. What this experience of uncertainty initiates -as reaction and as counterweight to it -is a specifically narrative activity of under- standing, a second moment or movement of thought that entails with it the form of diachrony. Here diachrony is not a form presented to, but rather created by the comprehending mind, whose attempt to understand concretely the meaning of a particular "truth"24 stated to be acknowledged universally extends dynamically to the following sen- tence and new paragraph in which, within characteristic Austenian "limits, "25 a minor revolution in narrative understanding begins: However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. Remarkably and almost unnoticeably, universal knowledge begins to be broken down here by the very workings of representation: certain "feelings or views" are admitted as ignored by this universally ac- knowledged truth-those of "such a man . . . on his first entering a neighbourhood" -and the "truth" itself is said to be "fixed" only in the "minds of the surrounding families," families qualified in addition as having one or more unmarried daughters. In the space of one sentence a kind of mock or ironic maxim has given way to the particular exigencies of narration: persons, actions, and their situation in context, their coordination along the axes of time and place -the demands not of universal knowledge but of the construction of a particular narrative plot. This rapid-fire process of specification continues immediately in the next sentence, which is no longer even a properly narrative sen- tence but one taken literally out of context, a piece of quoted dialogue spoken at a specific moment to someone named Mr. Bennet and con- cerning a specific place called Netherfield Park: "'My dear Mr. Ben- net,' said his lady to him one day, 'have you heard that Netherfield is let at last?' Mr. Bennet replied that he had not." What is effected in this simple sequence of sentences is an anatomy, 608 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="13">as clearly delineated as each new paragraph division, of the linguistic mental work that is the internal rule of fiction. If in reading Pride and Prejudice we read right by them, accepting such conceptual activity as given, that is because Austen had laid out concisely and deftly what we take blindly for granted in reading fiction: that fiction, like history, depends absolutely upon the representation of specifics, and that the relation between such specifics and any universal truth is as disputable and undependable as it is also absolutely necessary. In short, if there is a universal truth governing the writing of fiction, it is that fiction must be composed in concrete and specific rather than universal and abstract terms. Yet the specifics represented in novels would be lin- guistically indistinguishable from yesterday's news ("Dog Bites Man On Main St.," "Young Man Moves Into Netherfield") if narrative fiction did not also represent the way in which particulars are conceived and known. The fiction of Pride and Prejudice does not begin from the premise that the reality it represents can be known objectively as long as its own narrative reality is ignored. Austen's narrator does not opt out of the fiction by beginning with a third-person account of the narrative setting as if such a setting were not a beginning, a necessary device of the fiction, but rather an entry in medias res reflecting an already surrounding reality. All narratives must name places and agents as if representing a historical object world-this is their fiction. The opening of Pride and Prejudice neither conceals nor points to that fact but makes different forms of prose language enact its proof. Beginning with a proposition in the form of a universal truth, a truth already so trivialized and thus ironized in content that it appears at once to pit truth against all novels, including the one now beginning, the narrative takes shape as narrative in the moment it relativizes that truth, trans- lating universal knowledge into a type of concrete context. The insta- bility caused by the first sentence of Pride and Prejudice seems to settle down into the course of narration by moving "truth," as it were, along with Bingley, into a neighborhood. By the third sentence, the type becomes fully particular, the neigh- borhood neighbors on Netherfield, and the neighbors are specific in- dividuals made even more individual by speaking in their own words. But before there is a Mr. Bennet or a Mrs. Bennet who can name him for the reader, there is a statement implying that the fiction in which Mr. and Mrs. Bennet will continue to say and do things has some claim, however "narrow" and "trivial," in Hegel's terms, to the uni- versal. The universal truth stated at the opening of the novel invokes the imagining of a diachronic context in which its immediately un- Claudia Brodsky Lacour 609</page><page sequence="14">certain meaning may eventually be understood. The plot of Pride and Prejudice, one might say, remains to confirm that universal truth by submitting it to the trial and error of experience, relating an apodictic statement to concrete reality by involving truth in history. Like Hegel's "truth in art," Austen's novel, then, would be the history of an idea its opening sentence states. But the history which should demonstrate that idea, through the representation of narrative particulars, is named for the nonrepresentational causes of conceptual mistakes. Just as the first sentence of Pride and Prejudice at once states a truth and unsettles the claim of truth to universal validity, a true history of "pride and prejudice" would be more like an antihistory, a story of enlightenment never attained. Austen's continuing development of the representational context of the novel certainly suggests as much. The ensuing dialogue between the Bennets, a well-deserving favorite of the novel's devotees, is a touchstone of Austen at her conceptual best. Composing almost the entire remainder of chapter 1, its subject is the ostensible subject of all Austen's novels: marriage -the implied subject of this novel's opening maxim as well.26 But in the course of the Bennets' dialogue it soon becomes apparent that its subject does not matter at all: it is not what is said about marriage, that most particular of universals, which matters here at the beginning of the novel (nor, arguably, anywhere else in Austen) but what is revealed about those who say it which sets the terms of the history of "pride and prejudice" to come. When Mrs. Bennet's praise of Mr. Bingley's bacherlorhood and wealth ("What a fine thing for our girls!") inspires professions of literal-minded wonder from her husband ("How so? how can it affect them?"), and when her exclamations of exasperation ("My dear Mr. Bennet . . . how can you be so tiresome! You know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them") draw only a renewed exercise in disbelief ("Is that his design in settling here?" [3-4]), it is clear that Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, whatever thoughts may occupy them, are not in the habit of thinking along the same lines. Playing the part of the empirical philosopher to his wife's less subtle turn of mind, Mr. Bennet feigns a naivete that only years of experience can teach. Rather than describing that temporal situation as the Bennets' narrator, however, Austen again lets their dialogue do the talking for her. When Mr. Bennet finally accedes to understanding his wife's meaning, which now, or at any other time, is that their daughters must be married, he states flatly: "They have none of them much to recommend them . . . they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has 610 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="15">something more of quickness than her sisters" (5). Mrs. Bennet's pro- test- "Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? . . . You have no compassion on my poor nerves"-invites in turn her husband's elegant and thoroughly devastating reply, a concise survey of the long history of a mismarriage that no moment or chapter of dialogue can correct: "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least" (5). Mr. Bennet is so skilled at talking past his wife and his wife so obtuse in talking at him that the idea of communication between them during this or any conversation of "these twenty years" appears a veritable ideal of human communion, an idea whose time has not previously and assuredly will never come. Indeed the uncrossing men- tal registers of their speech may explain the formal register in which it is undertaken, for Mrs. Bennet regularly addresses her husband as "Mr. Bennet" throughout the novel. The repetition of the proper noun, Bennet, the formal marker of the couple's alliance, may be Austen's means of narrating all that is shared by the couple, and of giving a new mental twist to the cliched sexual meaning of "a marriage in name alone." While the Bennets' daughters indicate their marriage has been consummated in the figurative physical sense, the Bennets' dialogues indicate they will never be linked in any terms less tangible, that as far as their minds go the word "Bennet" is the only linguistic reference they share. Still this conversation devoid of common understanding may seem a simple comic interlude; as readers of a comic dialogue from which we assume a spectatorial distance, we may laugh at it, as we are certainly meant to, but only until it ends. For after Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have spoken, the voice of the maxim returns, speaking this time, however, and for the very first time, as the novel's third-person narrator. The tenor of that voice is just as definitive as before, but rather than stating a universal truth it narrates some very particular truths about Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, and these historical truths now have the effect (that, again, can only be called revolutionary) of standing the original maxim -both its form and overtly ironic content -on its head. For if marriage may result in the wedding of two such disparate spirits as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet then to follow the maxim may be to embrace a veritable kiss of death. The narrator concludes the opening chapter by declaring succinctly and directly what the preceding dialogue has dramatized at some length: Claudia Brodsky Lacour 611</page><page sequence="16">Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. (6) Now the maxim, it may be objected, refers specifically to "a single man in possession of a good fortune," and surely if Mr. Bennet were so well-fortuned financially his wife's monomania for marrying their daughters to men of good fortune might not exist. Thus the marriage between the Bennets, which could be more accurately described as permanent spiritual divorce, a perfect disunion of dissimilar souls, or, to bastardize Shakespeare instead of John Donne, a marriage of such minds as are each other's true impediment -certainly the Bennets' marriage cannot be considered as an argument against the truth of the maxim, a constraint upon universality issuing from the realm of the concrete. Yet the reader who, having read further, thinks back to the maxim, will realize that the well-born and bred Mr. Bennet was indeed once a single man of good fortune. His mistake may have been to marry Mrs. Bennet but his single misfortune was to have only daugh- ters, and thus to see his estate entailed to the insufferable Mr. Collins, the best argument made anywhere in fiction against the so-called natural right to property of the male. The first impression made by the maxim may be one of mere Austenian mock-seriousness, but when one realizes that in accordance with it Mrs. Bennet became Mrs. Bennet, it appears upon further inspection a proposition of entirely serious consequence, in the negative sense that this "truth universally acknowledged" might result in a life-long mistake. The first persons to be represented in this novel, or rather, to present themselves in their own words, are cogent arguments against the truth that the novel proposes. Within a few paragraphs of its opening sen- tence, as the novel moves, by way of representation, from the form of the maxim, to first-person dialogue, and finally, to authorial nar- ration, the gulf it reveals between abstract and representational lan- guage steadily grows. Yet marriage, the predicative referent of the maxim, also remains the motor of the story of this novel: not only does the unbearable Collins, for whom any mate will do, pursue (in a manner of speaking) that predicate, but Bingley also wants to marry Jane, and Darcy (remarkably) Elizabeth. From the obsequious Collins to the sternly self-assured Darcy, men of good fortune in Pride and Prejudice, 612 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="17">as stated by the maxim and represented in the novel's story line, are "in want of a wife." How does the knot get tied in this novel? Since this act of predication is the central action of the novel, to ask this question is the same as asking how abstraction is translated into rep- resentation, how the maxim gets made, or tied, into plot. Marriages in this novel are made when pride and prejudice no longer hold sway. What, then, precisely are pride and prejudice? First of all they are a quotation from a novel well known and admired by Austen, Fanny Burney's Cecilia, which closes with a kind of neatly self-can- celing repetition of the terms. Pride and prejudice, it is concluded in that novel, are the source of woes and also of their overcoming: "If to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination. "27 Austen knew her audience would recognize the subtext of her title, but- Pride and Prejudice is not like Cecilia precisely because in Cecilia pride and prejudice are easily identifiable, and, as the shaping motives of the novel's action, easily known. Here Austen's reference to an earlier text points to the differences rather than similarities of lexical significance that arise when abstract terms are engaged in a representational context. At the same time it points to the further possibility that within her own text these words may also have very different meanings, as, quite literally, in Pride and Prejudice they do.28 Prejudice, one can say to begin with, is a consequence of pride, a disposition for or against which results from the pride of being disposed in any manner at all. Prejudice indicates an object only in function of a subject who does or does not feel disposed toward it; thus it serves more to reflect and define the self than any particular object to which it refers. Prejudice affirms, negatively, the identity of the prejudger: he or she is someone who thinks something about something else and thinks this without need of external proof. As such prejudice is, most obviously, an inverted form of self-affirmation, or, in other words, pride. But what can be said about pride, an abstract noun which need not take any object? One can be proud of something, as one can be prejudiced for or against something, but in addition one can simply be proud without there being a fixed reference point for one's pride at all. It is Darcy's pride which, in one of the most memorable passages of the novel, is said to transform him within no time from an object of "admiration" to one of "disgust" in the eyes of those gathered at the same ball at which he does in fact judge and reject Elizabeth, after a moment's inspection, as quite beneath him (10). And it is his own Claudia Brodsky Lacour 613</page><page sequence="18">"pride" that Darcy himself will condemn as the narrow habit of mind from which Elizabeth, in rejecting him, had forcibly freed him (369). Similarly Elizabeth, so unlike Darcy in temperament, fortune, and circumstance, who would sooner laugh at herself and at Darcy's initial insult than indulge in any form of conceit, eventually attributes her misjudgment of Darcy to the "vanity" of having "prided" herself in her very ability to discern character truly (208). And it is Elizabeth who will finally commend Darcy for his pride once she believes she loves him, a pride she now perceives as well-merited and which she wishes her own sisters had been taught; a "pride" which in Darcy, as she ultimately persuades her father, is not "improper" at all (396). "Pride" is also appealed to by the professional eloper Wickham as the source to which the evil actions he imputes to Darcy "may be traced" (81). Indeed, the abstract notion of pride may be appealed to by just about anyone in this novel, and applied to just about anyone as well. It may be a good or bad thing in ostensibly good or bad people, or it may be a good or bad thing alternately in a single person, persons such as Darcy and Elizabeth themselves. If pride can be applied to anyone in the novel, it can serve any representational end; it is not a concept by which we can judge characters, for even such judgments may then become a source of pride. Like the novel's opening maxim, pride becomes a highly plastic bit of abstraction when imprinted with the particular, a highly malleable concept or verbal bit of clay rather than the tough bit of ivory into which, as Austen once remarked metaphorically, she carefully carved her fictions.29 If pride is a word emptied of specific determination in that it is filled with too many determinations, too many particular meanings- meanings that in different contexts serve different and often contra- dictory ends -then how is the end of knowledge, the overcoming of pride and prejudice, served in a novel named for pride and prejudice, words that hold too many meanings and thus cannot be said to hold true? How do prejudices become true perceptions in the novel, per- ceptions that take a shape which holds, as, hypothetically, the shape of marriage should hold instead of changing both shape and object with infinite plasticity? The fickle quality of perception in the novel is reflected not only-if most openly-in the tendency of Lydia and her mother to praise anything in a red coat that walks (Austen's won- derful analogue, from the female perspective, for that time-worn me- tonymy: anything in a skirt that moves), or in Darcy's unforgettably "mortifying," because unexpectedly "pleasing," second impression of Elizabeth, but also in Elizabeth's own response to Darcy's criticism 614 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="19">of the "unvarying" confines of country society, a criticism applicable to Austen's fictions as well.30 At that early stage of the novel it is Elizabeth who speaks wittily in favor of the inconstancy of human nature: "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever" (43). Once again the conceits of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 offer a critical gloss on the novel's steady stream of conceptual fictions: "Let me not to the marriage of true minds / Admit impediment. Love is not love / Which alters when it alteration finds." For something must indeed be inalterable, be unlike pride and prejudice in this novel, if Darcy is to marry Elizabeth and her feelings of disregard for him turn sensibly to their opposite. Some- thing must be observable that cannot alter itself in the course of ob- servation, that cannot be submitted to the abstractual alchemy of pride and prejudice, if pride and prejudice, the unreliable notions of the novel, are to be related to truth by representation, to name the history of how they are overcome. The endless interplay of abstraction and representation in the novel make such a thing hard to fix, yet, as sure as the novel begins with a maxim, it concludes by way of the particular, suggesting what such a thing is. Furthermore, in order to be true not only to Austen's "truth" but to its consequences, the diachronic mental activity involved in understanding her unstable equation of the universal with the partic- ular, such a thing must function as a referent both of mimetic rep- resentation and of verbal conceptualization. In addition to concretely plotted appearance it must take conversational form, providing the referent for a remark conceived as ironic within dialogue which, iron- ically, can be no irony for the author of that dialogue at all. If Darcy, on second observation, notices the "beautiful expression of [Elizabeth's] dark eyes" (23), it is for the intelligence and liveliness reflected in them that he desires to know her better. It is that same liveliness that "bewitched" him when reflected in her retorts (52), the liveliness of any conversation entered into with Elizabeth, the life of language spoken with the inexplicable quickness and grace of an ironic wit. But for Elizabeth to desire Darcy she must see something fixed- something with which she can have no conversation, which cannot be made light, bright, and sparkling by the lively translating power of her mind. One such thing, most obviously, is Darcy's letter, a suprising inclusion in the novel in that it is inordinately long and takes up almost an entire chapter (vol. 2, chapter 12), itself the second longest chapter in the book (yet still not, according to Austen, the needed chapter "of sense"). Darcy's letter is of course made of language, but, like no Claudia Brodsky Lacour 615</page><page sequence="20">stretch of language in the novel preceding it, it takes the form of monologue, the recounting of past occurrences that Wickham had already misrepresented in dialogue, a give and take of information and opinion in which Elizabeth had all too eagerly engaged. Dialogues may shape or alter one's thoughts, but there is nothing transformative one can say back to a written letter, nothing, in any case, that can change the writing on the page: that writing is fixed and its author beyond hearing, beyond the reach of our sentiments and beyond our power to change the sentiments which first gave rise to the words on the page. Darcy's letter does not bewitch Elizabeth but rather makes her think that, before reading it, "I never knew myself" (208), and her reading of that letter cannot bewitch Darcy as her conversation with him had done. The solitary writing and the solitary reading of that letter lead instead, as Elizabeth reflects negatively, to knowledge, just as another solitary moment in Pride and Prejudice does. But this is a moment of knowledge which makes Elizabeth know Darcy in addition to herself, a knowledge which in her own mind defines another as its object. In volume 3, chapter 1, the longest chapter in the novel, Elizabeth makes her celebrated visit to Pemberley. For the first and only time she gets to see something that she may admire rather than reshape into something worth seeing by the power of her ironic perspective, make bright by the power of her wit. Much has been made, and should be made, of this visit to Darcy's estate, for it is only in seeing it that Elizabeth begins to imagine herself in possible connection to Darcy- a connection, however, which remains mediated by the tasteful beauty and order of the estate itself.3' The narrator writes: "At that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something,"0 con- tinuing, "'And of this place,' thought she, 'I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own"' (245-46). Regardless of one's view of Elizabeth at this moment, the drift of her thoughts stands out markedly from the fiction. For it is a strange thing indeed to regret being a "stranger" to "rooms," to wish to be more "familiarly acquainted" with them, to be able to "rejoice in them as one's own" rather than rejoice in the expressed passion of, or wish to become more familiar with, their owner. Such thoughts appear even stranger when one considers that Elizabeth is not experiencing a naive displacement of feelings; she is freely viewing objects that please her in a way that Darcy's grave and apparently indifferent demeanor never pleased her, objects that, unlike Darcy's 616 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="21">pride, condescending proposal, and disturbing letter, need not even be read, let alone responsively or dialogically transformed. Elizabeth's imaginings about Pemberley leave Darcy quite out of the picture, until she sees Darcy at Pemberley in a picture. Walking in the family portrait gallery she is "arrested" by her recognition of Darcy in a painting, "'with such a smile over the face, as she remem- bered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her" (250). The reader may remember that Darcy is frequently described by the nar- rator as consciously averting Elizabeth's eyes lest she discern the light of admiration for her in his own. Here in the portrait the very liveliness of mind absent from Darcy's person is represented, and, the narrator observes: There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. .. and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression. (250-51; emphasis added) The "regard" referred to here is Darcy's half-unwilling, improperly expressed proposal of marriage, but, in a semantic irony of the narrative necessarily imperceptible to the mind of the character narrated, it is the painted regard of the arresting face in the portrait, "his eyes fixed upon herself," that Elizabeth now feels the warmth of, and for which she begins to feel particular attachment. "The canvas on which he was represented" represents Darcy better than he represents himself: it makes a truth about Darcy available to perception which his language and manners in conversation hide.32 In a novel filled with dancing and dialogue, social forms performed in pairs, this meeting between Eliz- abeth and Darcy requires the absence of one of the parties; in a novel filled with constant motion and conversation, this representation is silent and still: it neither speaks, nor moves, nor can be spoken back to. The truth that is mimetically fixed, that is inalterable in the portrait is one, however, that Elizabeth will not actually see in its subject. When Elizabeth finally gives voice to the change in her sentiments, Darcy, the narrator reports, "expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye," the narrator continues, Claudia Brodsky Lacour 617</page><page sequence="22">she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable. (366) The living rather than represented look that Elizabeth cannot meet eye-to-eye is not an object of proof of importance, nor of pride, whether negative or positive, nor of prejudice. Represented by the narrative and read only by the reader, it is not part of the conversation of the novel, but an ironic conversational rendering of the abstract truth we perceive in it is, a truth concerning the cognitive necessity of repre- sentation and fixity of reference. When Jane asks her sister soon after how long she has loved Darcy, Elizabeth responds that she "must date it from [her] first seeing his grounds at Pemberley" (373). This state- ment, the narrator implies- abruptly, was taken by Jane to have been meant ironically, or, in any event, not seriously. And indeed the nar- rator offers no retort to that perception on Jane's part, stating instead in the very next sentence: "Another intreaty that she [Elizabeth] would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment" (373). Elizabeth, it may be argued, was indeed utterly serious at that moment, as serious as at the precise historical moment occluded by its own mocking con- versational reference, when she began to know and so to love rep- resented what she could not perceive or love in life. Or if Elizabeth is not serious, being engaged once again in the dialogue of pride and prejudice and so deflecting a seriousness she knows she cannot fix in words by the brilliance of her ironic wit, then Austen, certainly, is. For Austen made the character of Elizabeth engaging not by objectively representing her person or nature but by giving her all the best lines of dialogue in the novel, lines which render Elizabeth's liveliness of mind in the mental medium of liveliness, words, the verbal power to create relations between the universal and the particular, the abstract and the concrete. But it is Austen too who narrates a representational fiction in which words themselves are pure fictions, the insubstantial vehicles of pride and prejudice, abstract notions that make history because no single representation can make them known; and who sent Elizabeth to Pemberley to compose within that fiction, in the fixed form of a nec- essarily nonverbal representation, a particular moment of the recog- nition of a universal truth which no dialogue, no matter how lively, light, bright, and sparkling can render. The "truth" that is given ref- erential meaning, that is fixed at the end of Pride and Prejudice but 618 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="23">never fully represented within it, never rendered fully present or conceptualized as representable, is an idea that continues after the end of the novel as story -to distinguish concrete from universal truths, history from an idea or ideology of history, from pride and from prej- udice, Hegel's "needs" of the spirit from its teleological, even if di- alectical, abstraction: it is a truth, after all, universally acknowledged, that a single man, in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

What- ever the medium of its appearance, art, as form of negation (precisely of reified historical contexts), presents for Adorno the concrete occasion for critical reflection in general. The theoretical consequences of this assimilation of the literary to the aesthetic are perhaps most tellingly represented in the essay, "Valery Proust Museum" (Prisms, trans. Sam Weber and Shierry Weber [Cambridge: MIT Press, 1984]) in which two modern authors whose sharply contrasting practices and conceptions of literature might have encouraged a discussion of the literary as such are used by Adorno to speak not about writing but about the fate of plastic artifacts displaced from their historical context, the negative enhancement of art by museums. What Adorno does not reflect on is that the fact of alienation rendered explicit by the artificial space of museums is one which remains in turn forever natural or innate to literature, in that the literary-copied, stored, disseminated, but rarely, and certainly never essentially displayed-includes that "space" of displacement within the alienated reality of its own medium, the fact of abstraction effected by language discussed further below. 3 A striking exception to this remains Adorno's insight that the inassimilable strange- ness of Kafka's writing owes precisely to its literal quality, its presentation of the metaphorical, alien or negative as positive reality ("Notes on Kafka," in Prisms [note 21, 243-71). 4 For Adorno's counter-critique of philosophies that seek rather to represent language as the mere propadeutic to a truth transcending words, see his The Jargon of Au- thenticity, trans. Knut Tarnowski and Frederic Will (Evanston: Northwestern Uni- versity Press, 1973). 5 On the hidden but no less "objective" "truth" of art and the "inconceivability of dialectic" without a concept of "objective truth," see especially Noten zur Literatur (note 2), 11, 19, 23, 25, 188-89, and "Cultural Criticism and Society," in Prisms, 9- 34 (28-29 in particular). 6 Outstanding exceptions to this use and abuse of narrative in the service of nonliterary history are the critical investigations of historiographic conventions carried out in the Claudia Brodsky Lacour 619</page><page sequence="24">works of Hayden White and Dominick LaCapra. While White, by a turn upon Vico, identifies historical narratives with the functions of tropes, and thereby allies historical with literary theory, LaCapra has emphasized the literary and rhetorical dimensions of all referential (or "informational") histories and their reading. See White, Metahistory: the Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1973), and Tropics of Discourse (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1978); LaCapra, Rethinking Intellectual History: Texts, Context, Language (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1983), and History and Criticism (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1985).

For both Brooks and Chambers the pragmatic potential of narrative to effect action through perception offers the most compelling ground for analyzing, rather that indicting, fiction. 8 G. W. F.

Diderot's important praise of Richardson's realism as "true" includes his celebrated comparison of the novel and history: "Oh Richardson! I would dare to say that the truest history is filled with lies, and that your novel is filled with truths . . . that often history is a bad novel; and that the novel, as you write it, is good history. Oh painter of nature, it is you who never lie!" (Diderot, "Eloge de Richardson," in Oeuvres completes, ed. J. Assezat, 20 vols. [Paris: Garnier, 1875-1877], 5:213, 221; translation my own). 10 See Lorna Martens, The Journal Novel (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985), for a comprehensive study of the rise and continuing development of the journal novel in modern continental literature. See also Novel and Romance: 1700-1800, ed. Ioan Williams (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1970). In The Origin of the English Novel 1600-1740 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1987), Michael McKeon describes the change from romance to novel as a generic occurrence grounded in and representing a breakdown of the beliefs and legal ties of the traditional aristocracy. The early realist fiction indicated by the present study, however, is both slightly later than McKeon's (who, in concluding, touches on Richardson) and extends beyond England. In addition, the discussion of the interplay between novel and romance in the following pages does not use the concept of genre as a touchstone for an argument concerning social relations, although one can easily assume that changing social relations are very much involved in what Scott describes in cognitive and perceptual terms (see below) as "real life." " See, for example, Saintsbury's stirring praise of Pride and Prejudice, in a preface written in 1894, as "the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most eminently quintessential of its author's works"-whose heroine, more than any other in fiction, he would choose "to live with and to marry" (Jane Austen: The Critical Heritage, 1870- 1940, Vol. 2, ed. B. C. Southam [London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1987], 215, 218). "2Jane Austen's Letters to Her Sister Cassandra and Others, ed. R. W. Chapman, 2 vols.

Press, 1952), for a psychological interpretation of irony as Austen's means of defending against the dangers of untoward passion.

See Lionel Trilling, "Mansfield Park," in The Opposing Self (New York: Viking, 1955), 206-30, for the seminal interpretation of that novel as a uniquely and unequivocally moral tale requiring Austen to pit irony "against irony itself" (224). For a fuller discussion of the issue and interpretation of irony in Austen see my Imposition of Form: Studies in Narrative Representation and Knowledge (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1987), 141-87. 14 Walter Scott, Review of Emma, Quarterly Review (1816), in Jane Austen: The Critical Heritage, ed. B. C. Southam (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1968), 59- 60. Scott's description of Austen's role in the historical development of the novel is echoed in Richard Whately's important review of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion in Quarterly Review (1821) (Southam, 1968, 87-105). In The Rambler No. 4 (1750) Samuel Johnson had offered a similar assessment of the turn of narrative from "heroic romance." Writing after the publication of Clarissa and Tom Jones, Dr. Johnson was probably responding more to Fielding than to Richardson when he classified new realist fiction under the contrasting category of "the comedy of romance." Still, his view that realist narratives depend upon their authors' "accurate observation of the living world" foresees Scott's later appreciation of Austen. On the influence of Dr. Johnson's periodical writings on Austen, see Frank W. Bradbrook, Jane Austen and Her Predecessors (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1967), 10-19. 15 Southam, 1968 (note 14), 62. 16 Southam, 1968, 61-65. 17 Southam, 1968, 64-65. 1 Southam, 1968, 68. 9 Southam, 1968, 106. 20 The purpose of realism to represent truth in fiction is underscored later by William Dean Howells (Criticism and Fiction, 1891) in his exclusive identification of the realist novel in England with Austen: "Realism is nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material, and Jane Austen was the first and the last of the English novelists to treat material with entire truthfulness. Because she did this, she remains the most artistic of the English novelists, and alone worthy to be matched with the great Scandinavian and Slavic and Latin artists" (Southam, 1987 [note 11], 203). 21 I use these words advisedly, as "First Impressions" was Austen's original title for the novel. Whether or not Austen borrowed the term from Richardson or Radcliffe, or from Hume's philosophy, it retains a specific importance with regard to Austen's own critical view of the immediate effect produced by the novel. The connection with Hume is helpfully developed by Tony Tanner in his Introduction to Pride and Prejudice (New York: Penguin Books, 1972), especially 11-13. 22 The Novels of Jane Austen, 3rd ed., ed.

All following quotations will be from this edition; all further references will be given parenthetically in the text by page number. 23 The line has been suggested to derive from a phrase of Addison's (The Spectator no. 413) with which, however, it shares only the words "universally acknowledged." See Bradbrook (note 14), 6. 24 Critics and admirers of the novel tend to characterize its unparalleled first sentence as "ironic," without, however, ever specifying precisely what or who the object of its irony is. The point seems to be to move on from the quizzical sentence quickly, which, in a sense, is what I am arguing the sentence itself causes us to want to do. No critic, to my knowledge, has raised the immediate and pragmatic question of what the sentence actually means, although all, I think, would universally acknowledge it cannot mean what it says. 25 While the present analysis clearly regards the common view of the limitations of Austen's fiction as a misjudgment based retrospectively on later third-person realist fiction -in which realism becomes equated with the range of representational language Claudia Brodsky Lacour 621</page><page sequence="26">rather than the interrelation of representation and speculation in experience-a per- suasive refutation of that view on mimetic and generic grounds (that is, drama vs. epic) is offered by Donald Greene, "The Myth of Limitation," in Jane Austen Today, ed. Joel Weinsheimer (Athens: Univ. of Georgia Press, 1975), 142-75. Greene argues that the "subject matter" we now require of realism (listed by Greene, citing Van Ghent, as "death, sex, hunger, war, guilt, God") is indeed represented in Austen's fictions, and that their presence must be imperceptible only to the most "literal-minded critic" (145, 153). Such literal-mindedness also accounts, Greene suggests, for the widely- held critical assumption that Austen's metaphor for her medium, "two inches wide of ivory," directly indicates her own limited purposes. The phrase is helpfully reinter- preted by Greene within its original epistolary context, an ironic and charitable com- parison by Austen of her own novels with the amateur efforts of the nephew to whom she writes (149-50). 26 It should be noted that as no other of Austen's novels contains more, or more "sparkling," conversation than Pride and Prejudice, in no other are the chapters so very short. After the third paragraph in which, unique in Austen's fiction, quoted dialogue rather than third-person narration serves to situate the novel's context, it is as if, for the most part, each chapter were itself but a line, a terse retort in a larger conversation the novel reports. - 27 Fanny Burney, Cecilia, or Memoirs of an Heiress (1782; reprint, London: Virago Press, 1986), 908. 28 The best discussion I have encountered of the novel's use of the terms occurs in Robert B. Heilman's excellent study, "E pluribus unum: Parts and Whole in Pride and Prejudice," in Jane Austen: Bicentenary Essays, ed. John Halperin (Cambridge: Cam- bridge Univ. Press, 1975), 123-43. Arguing that it is "the complex structure of definitions of pride that give both form and life to the story," Heilman compares the changing contextual significance of the term with the power of fiction to make us rethink ab- straction: "Art forces us out of the simple omnibus concept of daily life into the con- ceptual discrimination on which truth depends" (138). By contrast, Julia Kavanagh, in English Women of Letters (1862), offered an early allegorical reading of the terms: "Pride assumes the shape of the handsome, haughty Mr. Darcy; and Elizabeth Bennet, the lively, spirited girl, is Prejudice" (see Southam, 1968 [note 14], 187). Just as Sense and Sensibility has been recognized critically (by Wright [note 13], 86; Kenneth L. Moler, Jane Austen's Art of Illusion [Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1968], 61-73; and Ian Watt, "On Sense and Sensibility," in Jane Austen: A Collection of Critical Essays [Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1963], 48) to afford no direct correlation of its title with the Dashwood sisters, an allegorical identification of "pride" and "prej- udice" with the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth must ignore Austen's conspicuously inconsistent use of the terms. 29 See letter to J. Edward Austen, 16 December 1816, in Chapman (note 12), 469. See also note 25 of this essay. 30 "But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness" (23). 31 Here I both agree and take issue with Scott's famous statement that Elizabeth "does not perceive that she has done a foolish thing until she accidentally visits a very handsome seat and grounds belonging to her admirer" (Southam, 1968 [note 14], 65). While Scott's observation cannot be considered inaccurate, it clouds the crucial action of Elizabeth's visit, which, as the present analysis argues, takes place in a part of Pemberley from which the estate is not visible, that is, in front of Darcy's picture. Reginald Farrer misses the issue of the visit to Pemberley altogether when he ascribes 622 Austen and Hegel</page><page sequence="27">Elizabeth's "real feeling" for Darcy, like Emma's for Knightly, to a "subconsciously" continuous "love," asserting that because Austen "fumbled" this "psychological situ- ation" in Pride and Prejudice, she left "herself open to such a monstrous misreading as Sir Walter Scott's, who believed that Elizabeth was subdued to Darcy by the sight of Pemberley" (see "Jane Austen, ob. July 18, 1817," Quarterly Review [July, 1917], in Southam, 1987, 260). Saintsbury allowed that Elizabeth "would have married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it" (Southam, 1987, 218). 32 The opposition proposed in this analysis between the unresting verbal play of the novel and the nonverbal portrait, between perpetual conceptual error and referential recognition, stands in direct contrast to Reuben Brower's conclusion that "playfulness" in the novel gives way of itself to "sound judgments" (see "Light and Bright and Sparkling: Irony and Fiction in Pride and Prejudice," in Jane Austen: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Ian Watt [Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1963], 70). Brower astutely views the novel as "combining ... the poetry of wit with the dramatic structure of fiction" (62). But noting that, given the irony which pervades the novel's dialogues, "variety or forward movement in the drama will almost surely be difficult," he solves the dilemma he indicates by locating dramatic recognition in the dialogues themselves, displacing the structural narrative problem he had identified by declaratively uniting dramatic movement with wit: "The poetry of wit in Pride and Prejudice is completely dramatic" (64, 70). Brower's appeal to Austen's "belief that some interpretations of behavior are more reasonable than others" does little to illuminate how Elizabeth's "new view of Darcy" is achieved by way of narration except to imply, by a rather circular logic, that it is assumed by the novel to begin with: "The assumption that more reasonable interpretations of conduct are attainable provides for the movement toward a decisive change in relationships at the climax of the novel" (70-71). 33 Farrer contends that, contrary to her own words, and despite the important elision here of any authorial commentary, Elizabeth had indeed always loved Darcy. He takes the second reported entreaty as nonironic proof that Elizabeth's original response was "emphatically a joke" (Southam, 1987 [note 11], 260). Claudia Brodsky Lacour 623</page></plain_text>
