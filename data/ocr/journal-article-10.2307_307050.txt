<plain_text><page sequence="1">"LIVE AND LOVE": THE SPIRITUAL PATH OF VALENTIN RASPUTIN Margaret Winchell, University of Kansas-Lawrence From the beginning of his literary career in 1967 with the publication of his first collection of short stories, Cielovek s etogo sveta (A person from this world) and his first novella, Den'gi dlja Marii (Money for Maria), Valentin Rasputin has been one of the foremost writers of "village prose." Although widely varied, village-prose writing has largely been concerned, as Deming Brown (251) points out, with the economic and social welfare of the village, describing farming practices, the psychology and aspirations of the peasant- ry, and the traditional customs and values of the countryside. While addressing the ethical, moral, and, to some extent, spiritual side of rural life, such works rarely take the religious aspects of spirituality as their cen- tral theme. As the village-prose movement gradually declined in significance during the 1970s (Shneidman, 75), Rasputin's works continued to achieve great artistic success as well as wide-spread popularity within the Soviet Union while remaining grounded in the realistic representation of peasant life. His major works, Poslednij srok (Borrowed time, 1970), Zivi i pomni (Live and remember, 1974), and ProManie s Materoj (Farewell to Matera, 1976), are all set in rural Siberian communities and treat the moral and psychological dilemmas of villagers faced with death, with the harshness of Soviet law, and with the destruction of their traditional way of life. Yet the universal significance of his characters and themes carry these novellas beyond the bounds of provincialism into the mainstream of Russian litera- ture (Zalygin, 179). After a six-year hiatus,' Rasputin's next major publica- tion was a collection of short stories entitled Vek Iivi-vek ljubi (Live and Love),' which represents a bold step away from village prose and indeed from socialist realism in general. While including a number of stories written during the 1960s and early 1970s, Live and Love also contains several written after Farewell to Matera that mark a distinct change in emphasis from his previous works. Although set in Siberia, these later stories concentrate on urban (rather than rural) characters, on men (rather than on simple peasant women), and they depict SEEJ, Vol. 31, No. 4 (1987) 533</page><page sequence="2">534 Slavic and East European Journal their attempts to transcend the material world and attain a spiritual dimen- sion, often through mystical experiences. Environmental issues, criticism of government policy, details of rural life, and the usual themes of village prose are relegated to the background, while the spiritual quest of a troubled, and often solitary, main character becomes central-a drastic departure not only from the main currents of village prose but also from Soviet literary tradition as a whole. The most successful of these recent works and the best illustration of this new emphasis in Rasputin's writing is the title story of the collection, "Live and Love." Unlike this earlier tales, "Live and Love" is a coming-of-age story about a fifteen-year-old boy who loses his innocence after a trip into the heart of the taiga. Thematically and artistically, it bears little resemblance to Ras- putin's previous works, for here the author explores ideas and experiments with artistic methods that had been largely an undercurrent in his previous writings. A close examination of "Live and Love"-of its emphasis on the characters' spirituality, of its depiction of nature, of its use of religious and folkloric motifs, and of its artistic devices-demonstrates the striking extent to which Rasputin's new direction diverges from his established one. The story's opening sentence reveals the adolescent Sanja's burning desire to sever his ties with childhood: "To the person who doesn't have it, inde- pendence seems so fascinating and attractive that he would give up anything for it" (3). While he does not plan "to cross any boundaries," only "to push them back a bit" (3), this is exactly what he does, experiencing much more than he had expected and in the process undergoing painful changes that he did not anticipate. The means for achieving independence is his first over- night outing in the taiga, which acquires cosmic proportions and leads to a revelation of evil. Sanja leaves his family and civilization, is led into the heart of nature by an older man, who serves as his guide, has a mystical experience there, and returns permanently altered, a child no more. But Sanja is not the only innocent in the story. Most of the other charac- ters are also described as childlike (kak malen'kie). Sanja regards his parents' behavior when they are in his presence as infantile: "'You're like little kids, honestly, just like little kids,' Sanja told them mentally, using their tone of voice, annoyed" (4). The two men who take him on a berry-picking expedi- tion are described with the same phrase (30). By observing his parents, Sanja concludes that "because of his weaknesses a person remains a child his whole life" (4), a concept exemplified by Mitjaj. Something of a social misfit and not especially bright, Mitjaj knows that berries left to stand in a galvanized pail will produce toxin, a fact of which Sanja is ignorant; this knowledge does not register until too late. Uncle Volodja, on the other hand, understands perfectly well that Sanja is ruining his berries and allows him to do it. He accuses Mitjaj of similar deviousness: "How come you're playing innocent? [The pail of berries] was in plain sight, standing there</page><page sequence="3">"Live and Love" 535 right out in the open! What are you, a little kid?" (40). Mitjaj is indeed an innocent, never having learned to recognize evil (here in the form of Uncle Volodja, whom he had regarded as a friend), and he will remain so all his life. The only character in the story not described as childlike in some way is Grandma, a counterpart to the wise old women of Rasputin's previous novellas; however, unlike her predecessors, her role here is extremely minor. Thus adults too are innocent to some extent and carry the potential for mystical transformation, which in this story only Sanja fulfills. Loss of innocence in "Live and Love" is presented as the discovery of a spiritual dimension and the consequences of that discovery. Impatient to shed his innocence, Sanja eagerly embarks on a new experience that intro- duces him to the existence of a spiritual realm of which he was already vaguely aware. Traditional elements of folklore-ghosts, spirits, devils- provide inklings of a nonmaterial world. To calm his fears while staying alone in his grandmother's creaky old cottage, Sanja reads Gogol"s Eve- nings on a Farm near Dikanka: After reading this book of stories . . ., with voices straight from the netherworld, your own rustlings in the corner and behind the wall no longer carried any force or fear, and Sanja would fall asleep. In his conception the ghosts and evil spirits that were there, in the book, for some reason did not join those that might be here, as if they didn't wish to acknowledge the present wasted and inglorious breed as their future. (6) Sanja has been raised in the Russian tradition of believing in spirits, who calm and comfort him and thus create a positive image of the spiritual world. Outdoor night sounds also belong to that other world and seem to emanate from animate beings-the ships groan at sea, the wind shrieks in the walls at night, and the drone of Lake Baikal "calls out in the dark for something it's lost and gets no answer" (6). They, too, surround Sanja and hint at another realm. Other characters also uphold the traditional belief in spirits. Grandma refers to the Devil and the Evil Spirit (djavol, necistyj) (8), Mitjaj and other local inhabitants fear the Evil Eye (sglaz) (8), and even Papa, an educated city dweller, says that people act like werewolves (pere- vertyli) (17). The spiritual world touches not only the holders of simple folk beliefs, but also those attracted to metaphysical concepts. Papa wonders aloud whether people are not actually dead, but do not realize it. Pondering a phrase he has just read, "the deathly terror of birth," he states, "We may think we're alive, but maybe we were buried long ago and don't remember a thing. .... We don't realize that we don't exist, that somebody just put all our sins and passions together to see what we were like" (17). While Mama becomes frightened by these notions and silences him, Sanja later recalls his father's words and begins to view events in this context during his trip into the taiga. As he watches other berry-pickers leave the train and enter the</page><page sequence="4">536 Slavic and East European Journal woods with wooden baskets on their backs, "the people moving into the dark ravine, passing the uninhabited houses as if they were the graves of strangers, seemed to be going out in search of their own eternal refuge and carrying in these strange vessels the sum total of their lives" (16). And he hears the phrase from Papa's book uttered in the voice of the unknown person who said it first (17). Apart from his father's influence, Sanja already believes in the idea of a double (13). He also believes in predestination and in a cosmic memory: "Doesn't [a human being's] whole life exist in him primordially from beginning to end and doesn't there exist in him a memory that also helps him recall what to do? ... Every life is really the recollection of the path put into each person at birth. Otherwise what's the sense of letting him into the world?" (24-25). Through his belief in spirits, through his father's influence, and through his own prior contemplation of meta- physical concepts, Sanja is thus well prepared to be receptive to the mystical experience that awaits him; when he reaches the heart of the taiga, he is completely "open to everything, everything all around" (26). The mystical experience that robs Sanja of his innocence is described as a feeling of fusion with cosmic forces during which something enters the boy while something else leaves: And suddenly the darkness heaved a single sigh, far-reaching and sad, striving for something, and then it sighed once more. Twice the resonance of some tremendously deep, suppressed anguish breathed on Sanja, and he seemed to recoil involuntarily and then start after this eternity-bound call coming from who knows where-he recoiled and then started after it as if something had entered him and something had left him, but they'd entered and left so that, after trading places, they could then communicate without interference. Sanja lost track of himself for several moments, not understanding and afraid to understand what had happened; a pleasant warmth spread throughout his body in a continuous gentle wave, tension and expectation disappeared altogether, and he got up and crossed over to the hunting shack with the sense of a certain special completeness and ultimate consummation. (32) During this trance, Sanja undergoes a permanent change. The next day he is bursting with a feeling of unity with the world and with the discovery that "there's a lot inside him that he didn't know about or suspect," and he feels "ready for anything" (35). The vision prepares him for the revelation of evil that will occur on the return trip. What enters Sanja during his stupor is the hazy realization, soon to be clarified, that human beings, including him, embody evil as well as good, and what leaves him, conse- quently, is his boyhood innocence. This mystical experience occurs only because Sanja is already favorably disposed toward the spiritual realm and because he has left civilization far behind. Such experiences, in Rasputin's view, are inextricably bound up with nature and happen only within a completely natural setting. The story's action consists of a journey from an urban environment through a rural one into a natural one, with the gradual shedding of human company until</page><page sequence="5">"Live and Love" 537 the protagonist is utterly alone. "Live and Love" begins in a small town on Lake Baikal, to which Sanja has been sent from his home in the city while his parents are on a vacation trip. Heading west, they are getting farther away from Sanja all the time. As soon as he arrives, his grandmother is summoned away to attend to her ill daughter, and he is left on his own. He then journeys with two men into the wilderness by train, along a route carefully measured by kilometer markers; the cars are terribly crowded at first and gradually empty the farther they go. After leaving the train, the three head into the taiga on foot, a vast wild expanse of "many, many unmeasured kilometers" (24). And finally, after they make camp in the wilderness and while the others sleep, Sanja sits alone by the campfire in the rain. Only the primal elements of fire and water are visible in the utter blackness of the night (30-31), and Sanja is now as stripped of civilization as he can possibly be. The day after his trance, he and the others head back. As they proceed along the return route to civilization, the taiga acquires sinister qualities, becoming a place where the Devil himself might break a leg (38), and they begin to run, fleeing the forest at full speed. Shortly thereafter, while they wait by the railroad tracks for the train back to town, Uncle Volodja reveals his essential evil and confirms what had been revealed to Sanja the night before. Sanja's belief in goodness is poi- soned and his innocence destroyed, but the power and beauty of his mystical experience have prepared him to survive this revelation. Recollections of the majestic taiga and of what happened there ("Let anything, anything happen-he has seen this!" [37]) allow him to bear it, to live and learn and ultimately to live and love, for love is the antidote to evil. The story closes with Sanja's dream in which voices speak in anger, alarm, and dismay, all of which belong to him. He awakens in terror, wondering what this is and how it has ended up inside him. The innocence he had longed to shed is now gone, but not completely: "And only one voice uttered things-crude and dirty words spoken in a familiar, confident tone-that weren't in him and never could be" (41). Sanja will retain a measure of incorruptibility as he returns to civilization and learns to cope with the evil of which he has just become painfully aware. In the story, nature in the form of the taiga not only provides an appropri- ately isolated setting for communing with cosmic forces, but also heightens Sanja's perceptions and prepares him for entry into the spiritual world. Raised in the city, Sanja is regarded by Mitjaj as "someone who had abso- lutely no experience in the taiga, or in anything else, for that matter, a tame city boy" (11). As he weeds his grandmother's garden, he suddenly becomes aware of a new sensation of uniqueness and self-worth and is amazed that this particular mundane task should foster such a discovery (5). Later, on his way toward the taiga, he begins to view berry-picking as a metaphor for a search for eternal life (16). And as he hikes through the woods, he sees</page><page sequence="6">538 Slavic and East European Journal almost every natural object as animate and even human. The taiga itself dozes (19) and seems quite gloomy (26). Sanja regards the bilberries as human: he talks to them as he picks, feels guilty about killing them and barbaric eating them (28), and believes that they live and breathe for a time after being severed from the bush before finally suffocating in his pail (29). Darkness (32), fire (34), the sun (33), and the earth (35) are also alive. During his trance, mysterious forces peer at him through the darkness, he feels them breathing on him, and he refers to them as "who" (kto) (31-32). Only after he reaches the heart of the taiga are Sanja's perceptions acute enough to recognize the "eternity-bound call" (vozvec'ennyj zov) (32) that he hears as he sits by the fire in a trance. The reverse process takes place when he leaves the taiga. Nature outside the woods is dull and dead (37). There is no sense of unity, for the various parts of the landscape do not come together in a single whole (39). Within the taiga, by contrast, natural objects are not only animate, but they also have moral force and will take revenge on those who despoil the forest and commit other evils. Mitjaj does not need to punish Uncle Volodja for his evil deed because, as he tells him, "the first tree trunk will fall on you all by itself, the first rock will come loose and fall on you. You'll see. They don't like such tricks ... Oh, no, they don't like them!" (41). Thus the taiga performs an important function as the gateway to the spiritual world, providing the setting for Sanja's mystical experience and preparing him for it, a role that makes the taiga a central figure in itself. The integral link between nature and the spiritual world provides a standard by which the characters' spirituality can be gauged. They form a continuum: the more firmly they are rooted in civilization, the more alien- ated they are from the spiritual dimension and the closer they are to nature. Mama is furthest from nature. She dislikes her birthplace on Lake Baikal and visits it reluctantly (9), preferring to spend her vacation touring big cities on the westernmost edge of European Russia (Riga, Kaliningrad, and Brest) (8), which remind her as little as possible of the Siberian taiga. A conventional woman, she is frightened by talk of matters beyond the here and now, fears her husband's unorthodox views on death, and rejects them (17). Papa, on the other hand, is a city dweller who feels attracted to nature, loves berry-picking, and would greatly prefer Baikal to Brest (14). He is also drawn to Mitjaj, the character closest to nature, and accompanies him every summer on expeditions into the taiga. His interests extend beyond the material; he reads about and ponders ontological questions. But his expe- riences with the spiritual world remain cerebral, and he backs away from them when his wife objects (17). Grandma, an uneducated peasant woman, lives in close proximity to nature, which she views in anthropomorphic terms. She believes in the Devil (8) and most likely in God, too. Of the story's minor characters, her life is most entwined with nature and closest to the spiritual realm.</page><page sequence="7">"Live and Love" 539 Even more closely attuned to nature than Grandma is Mitjaj, an outcast among the townspeople (9-10) who is completely at home only in the taiga. He talks to wild animals (24) and even has an animal's name (7). He sym- pathizes with the bears whose territory they invade (33). He is master of the taiga and its guardian (22). Although he has a reputation for drinking and for having served time in prison, he is also totally honest and in perfect harmony with himself (12). Papa defends him by declaring that "even in his most brutish state Mitjaj remained a human being and behaved like a human being" (10). The closest of all the characters to nature, he is instinc- tively drawn to what is right and just, remaining naively oblivious to the evils of the world-exactly the opposite of Uncle Volodja. As evil personified, Uncle Volodja pervades the entire continuum. He is a town dweller who goes into the taiga and desecrates it, both a stranger to that area (18) and Mitjaj's next-door neighbor. He is crude, physically repugnant (38), and out of shape (21, 23, 28). His attitudes and behavior make him an eyesore in human society as well as in nature, with which he is constantly at odds. His cruelty to Sanja demonstrates his true character and comes as no surprise. Sanja progresses from one end of the continuum to the other. He begins as a naive city boy who knows little of the spiritual realm; he finishes, at the story's climax, by entering it. Moving from the care of his parents to that of his grandmother and finally to Mitjaj's, he travels into the heart of the taiga, where he discovers another world, becomes the victim of Uncle Volodja's treachery, and acquires a knowledge of evil that destroys his innocence. The spiritual dimension and the knowledge it affords are not only inex- tricably bound up with nature, but are also accessible through feeling and intuition rather than reason or logic. Sanja's vision defies verbal description (29), and after his mystical experience he concludes that "there's a lot inside him that he didn't know about or suspect" (35). He senses that nothing happens or exists by chance and that life does indeed have meaning even though he is incapable of explaining it rationally. In the face of this cosmic inexplicability, we are all confused adolescents capable only of a dim com- prehension of the meaning of life: "'Something,' 'somehow,' 'somewhere,' 'sometime'- how dim and vague it all is, how smeared and smudged with hazy notions and feelings, and isn't it really the same for everybody? But he'd been closer to this 'something' and 'somehow' than he'd ever been before" (36). Although it is impossible to fully comprehend the significance of life, we can come closest to it through mystical experiences such as Sanja's, through exposure to the spiritual dimension, however briefly, by means of our feelings and intuition and with the help of nature. As Sanja moves from the material world to the spiritual world and back, his belief in predestination is confirmed. He has only to decide to become</page><page sequence="8">540 Slavic and East European Journal independent when, through a series of seeming coincidences, an opportunity readily appears (3). His parents left, then his grandmother left, and "every- thing fell perfectly into place for Sanja" (5). His trip into the taiga also seems pre-ordained. He has a strong sense of deji vu when he first sees their campsite: "Within five minutes after they'd arrived at the hunting shack, Sanja no longer had any doubt that he'd been here before. He'd never been here in reality, of course, but he seemed to have arrived just where he was meant to arrive, not deviating from the path that lay before him like a dotted line, and to have found here just what he was meant to find" (25). Nature, too, is subject to the direction of some higher power. A tornado sweeping off Lake Baikal, a "monstrous diabolical force," has left "stumps standing in a curious order that didn't appear to be accidental" (21-22). Sanja refers to the force he senses near him during his vision as "who" (31), and his view that human lives and acts are predetermined by some being, as are the workings of nature, is borne out by his own experience. The tale of Sanja's discovery of a spiritual dimension has strong religious overtones that appear as an intermingling of Christian and pagan myths. His adventures in the taiga are quite similar to the story of the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis. The setting for his mystical experience closely resembles the description of Eden itself. The heart of the taiga, unlike the civilized world, "contained every possible color and was filled with life like no other place anywhere" (25); the world Sanja has just come from, by contrast, seems crowded, gray, and wintry (35). The campsite constitutes a perfect place for human habitation and has been made ready for occupation by some invisible hand before Sanja arrives (25). The berry patch is a virgin spot-they are the first pickers to find it-and the fruit hangs in great abundance (28). The site is bisected by a river, as in the Biblical garden. And the place has a timeless quality: as he picks berries, Sanja becomes hypnotized and loses all track of time (29). Despite the absence of Eve, the principal characters in this story corre- spond to the Biblical figures. Sanja, like Adam, is an innocent until he eats of the fruit (of knowledge of good and evil). Uncle Volodja, the agent of evil, plays the role of the serpent: he is even referred to as a "serpent" (gad) three times (40). Mitjaj represents a guardian angel who fails at his job. The taiga is "his garden" (svoj ogorod), which Uncle Volodja accuses him of jealously guarding and allowing only certain people to enter (22). But unlike the Biblical cherubim, Mitjaj actually leads the serpent into Eden. The story also contains elements of pagan beliefs. The setting of Sanja's spiritual experience and his journey to reach it resemble certain Greek and Roman myths about the netherworld. The eerie railway tunnels through which he travels (17) can be viewed as twilight passages to the land of the dead. Passengers leaving the train and heading into the taiga cross a place</page><page sequence="9">"Live and Love" 541 that looks to Sanja like "an old burial ground" (16). And after getting off the train and entering the forest on foot, Sanja and his companions must ford a river before reaching the site of the boy's spiritual encounter just as Greeks entering Hades had to cross the River Styx. Greek and Roman conceptions of the kingdom of the dead resemble the area of the taiga into which Sanja is conducted. The underworld of the ancients was generally divided into two parts, a place of torment for con- demned souls and a place of blessedness for good souls (Hamilton, 39). Before reaching their campsite, Sanja must cross a wide strip of tornado- ravaged earth, hideously ugly and tortuously difficult to traverse (21-23). Their stopping place, by contrast, resembles the Elysian Fields, through which runs Lethe, the river of forgetfulness, from which the souls who will return to life in the mortal world must drink (Virgil, book 6, lines 713-15). The heart of the taiga likewise contains a river, from which Sanja takes a drink the day after his trance. His memories of the previous night's expe- rience then become hazy, and complete understanding of what happened eludes him (36). His encounter with the spiritual realm takes place only after he crosses the boundary between life and death, an idea present in classical mythology and bolstered in this story by allusions to Hades. Slavic mythology and its manifestations in Russian folklore also have some bearing on the story. Rasputin, himself steeped in folklore, states that "a serious artist cannot come into being without folklore, without it per- meating the fiber of his soul" ("Otkuda oni v Irkutske?," 8).3 Most relevant to "Live and Love" are the mythic and folkloric representations of paradise. The land of Bujan, part of the formulaic introductions to many Russian folk tales,4 was depicted as an island and as a holy city.5 It was known for its river, whose waters had the power to cure all pain and illness (Robinson and Wilson, 175). In some versions it is a magic rock that cures sickness and grants immortal life. Seven venerable old men were thought to live on the island and to cast spells with the help of ants (Vilinbaxov, 179). In addition to resembling details of the setting of Sanja's vision, some of these attributes also appear in the descriptions of altered consciousness: shortly after reaching the heart of the taiga, he sits on a rock in a state of enchantment (26), and that night he stares at ants racing along the burning firewood just before his mystical experience (30-31). Russian folklore also held that the city of Bujan, located beneath the river, was the home of the spirits of the dead. The religious significance of this island is evident in the substitution of the word "holy" for "Bujan," for Russian folklore uses Bujan-ostrov (Bujan Island) and Svjat-ostrov (Holy Island) interchangeably (Vilinbaxov, 178). Another conception of paradise, one that resembles the Biblical description, is raj. Envisioned as a place of perfection, it served, among other purposes in Slavic mythology, as a playground for children, whose souls played and shouted among the trees and picked golden fruit</page><page sequence="10">542 Slavic and East European Journal forever (Robinson and Wilson, 175-76). Most important for the story are Rasputin's borrowings from the religious beliefs of the Asiatic peoples-the Evenks, Burjats, and Jakuts-who settled around Lake Baikal. Elements of shamanism, which provide a peculiarly local feeling of exotic mysticism, add considerably to the spiritual atmosphere created by parallels with Christian, classical, and Slavic myths. A number of Rasputin's early works reveals an intimate knowledge of shamanistic prac- tices;6 the very collection in which "Live and Love" appears includes one of them, "Staruxa" (The old woman) (183-89). Shamanism is the basic religion of certain indigenous peoples in northern Asia who believe that the world contains good and evil spirits that can be summoned or heard by a few inspired individuals who act as mediums (Eliade, 4). The term shamanism is borrowed by way of Russian from the Tungusic word gaman, from the verb ga- 'to know'. Thus a shaman is one who knows, specifically, one who pos- sesses special knowledge of the spirit world. While in a state of ecstasy, he is able to communicate with these spirits and to obtain healing powers from them. Sanja's mystical experience is very similar to a shamanistic trance, and he has much in common with those initiated to this calling. Although a shaman from southern Siberia may attain his vocation through hereditary transmission or through spontaneous election (Eliade, 17-20), he is always regarded as the specific choice of the spirits. He is often chosen against his will, usually at the age of puberty, and undergoes initiation in the form of a dream-like trance. The adolescent Sanja, with his belief in ghosts and in predestination and with his capacity for experiencing deja vu, is a good candidate. He senses that he is being led to a particular place in the taiga, which he somehow recognizes on first sight, even though he knows he has never been there before, and feels that he has found precisely what he was destined to find (24-25). Mitjaj, an older man thoroughly familiar with the ways of the taiga, can be interpreted as the elder who prepares the novice for his initiation. Hiking through the woods, Sanja regards inanimate objects as animate, much the way native peoples view the natural world through the lens of animism. As in shamanistic ritual, Sanja's mystical vision occurs at night in the space around a fire. Instead of using music and drumbeats, he is entranced by the rhythmic patter of rain. And the story's depiction of the vision itself is almost identical to the following description of a shamanistic trance: The transformative power that the shaman invokes is experienced as an all-encompassing pres- ence that is mysterious but as real as the wind or as breath, after which it is sometimes designated as 'spirit.' It evokes the awesome feeling generally associated with the holy. Although for the most part seen as a benign force, this power is also feared when experienced in its terrifying aspects .... It evades articulate expression and remains ineffable. Yet, visible in dreams and visions, in memories of dead ancestors, in the fecund earth, and in the expansive sky, this mysterious power is so manifestly present that no explanation of it is adequate. (Grim, 3-4).</page><page sequence="11">"Live and Love" 543 Like a shaman, Sanja is taken over and transformed by powerful forces intimately connected with nature. He too acquires a healing capability; however, instead of curing others, he uses his new insight to counteract his own crushing realization of evil and to live and love in spite of it. While in twentieth-century Siberia the city boy's experience does not find expression in shamanistic ritual, the parallels with shamanism are nonetheless striking and contribute greatly to the story's sense of authenticity and local flavor. These particular parallels with Christian, Graeco-Roman, and Slavic myths, along with elements of Russian folklore and shamanism, have several common denominators that support the story's central purpose. The tales and rites that Rasputin alludes to all include crossing boundaries between the real physical world and the world of spirits, between life and death-a requisite transition, in the author's view, for the sort of experience Sanja undergoes. They also depict similar spirit worlds and emphasize the power and beauty of nature, which upholds Rasputin's thesis that spiritual states of mind can be attained only in a natural setting and not in the everyday world of civilization. Perhaps most important, they create a religious underpinning that gives Sanja's experience a timeless, universal, and sacred quality, endowing it with a significance far beyond that of the adventures of a Soviet youth. These mythological, folkloric, and shamanistic elements are subtly blended together in a way that reinforces their common features and contributes to the nebulousness of the boy's mystical vision, to the diffuseness of a spiritual realm that is beyond rational grasp. Related to the theme of spiritual transcendence is the idea that the past is preferable to the present, that it is more colorful, more interesting, more desirable than contemporary life in many ways. Gogol"s ghosts are towering giants compared to the night sounds of the present, and the tattered old book Sanja reads is more effective than a new one (6). Today's passenger trains are also far inferior to past models, which were designed and operated with the comfort and convenience of the passengers in mind. Stops were even scheduled just to let people admire the beauties of nature (14). During Sanja's train ride, the passengers have to make prior arrangements with the engineers to brake where they want to get off, and as they drop to the ground, the engineers make the train jerk to hurry them along (18). Nowa- days goods are more important than people; a few passenger cars are coupled onto a freight train, become impossibly crowded, and look like "monsters" (Lxudo-judo) (13-14). As in Rasputin's previous works, technological progress that destroys the past is depicted negatively. In this story the scenic railroad that once followed the course of the Angara River had to be moved to higher ground after the construction of the Irkutsk Dam, which flooded the tracks; as a consequence, the villages, along with the rich, bustling, colorful life once prevailing along this former route, withered away and became ghost towns (15). The rather lengthy descriptions of former and present states of</page><page sequence="12">544 Slavic and East European Journal the railroads not only reveal nostalgia for the past, but also provide addi- tional motivation for seeking relief from modern life through nature and ultimately, if possible, through transcendental experiences such as Sanja's. Thematically, "Live and Love" differs noticeably from Rasputin's earlier works in its sharp shift in emphasis. It mixes realism with mysticism and metaphysics and explores philosophies and states of being that are treated only briefly in previous tales. Perhaps the greatest divergence from village prose, and certainly from socialist realism, is the central focus on an essen- tially religious experience. While his previous works also treat the life of the spirit and even carry religious connotations, they do so largely through symbolism, which often remains overlooked among their more obvious and accessible themes.' Christian and pagan myths are not peripheral in this story but play a significant role in depicting a spiritual realm that Soviet literature often presents as the outdated belief of old women. Sanja's expe- rience is plainly a religious one, whose sacred nature is conveyed chiefly by the interweaving of elements common to various religions. This device marks a distinct change from village-prose writers' usual use of folk beliefs for the creation of local color: in "Live and Love" Rasputin relies on myth as a means of grappling with questions of philosophy and theology, which results in a number of propositions that become startling in a Soviet context. Human lives, the story implies, are subject to predestination rather than to free will; each person's life is foreordained at birth. Free will is possible to a certain extent, for some people ignore their paths or purposely take oppo- site routes (24), but in this story predestination clearly predominates. Con- sequently, nothing happens by coincidence or chance. Although it is impos- sible to fathom the exact meaning of life, we can come close to it by communing with the higher forces in the spiritual dimension that surrounds, but usually eludes, us. Because this dimension lies just beyond the boundary between life and death and affords a glimpse of life after death, it belies the notion that biological death means the end of existence. Communion with the spiritual world also provides moral sustenance to help us cope with the evils of contemporary life. The means for achieving ecstatic communion is not human society or institutions but nature, and the taiga functions in this story not just as a setting but as a central figure in itself. Unlike Rasputin's previous works, "Live and Love" contains little social criticism and few of his standard themes. It treats self-discovery and the cosmic forces guiding human life, and touches only tangentially on environmental concerns and the conflict between technological progress and human welfare. Indeed, it picks up where works like Money for Marija leave off: having already established the moral superiority of villagers like Kuz'ma over their sophisticated city cousins, Rasputin here attempts to show how the corrupted urban dweller can recover his lost spirituality. In subject matter and in themes, the story thus focuses directly on spiritual problems and solutions raised only indirectly in previous works.</page><page sequence="13">"Live and Love" 545 "Live and Love" also marks a significant departure in artistic method. In addition to relying on elaborate parallels with various religious myths, the author also uses simpler imagery to support and elucidate the story's the- matics, although weaving it through the text in a complicated way. Ordinary objects at the beginning of the story reappear later as metaphors pertaining to the central cosmic experience. The garden image, for example, is intro- duced when Sanja arrives in the country and begins to tend his grandmoth- er's garden, ogorod, the quintessential symbol of nature under human con- trol. Yet even as he makes the cultivated rows still neater, nature asserts itself and gives Sanja an inkling of his impending experience (5). Later, the same word, ogorod, is applied to the wilds of the taiga (22), where powerful uncontrollable forces completely engulf Sanja and he makes his transition from the material to the spiritual world. A similar transformation occurs in the image of berries. At the beginning of the story we are given a straightforward account of how to make jam and preserves (9). In contrast to these mundane, domestic details, berries are later described in their natural state in a poetic passage that alludes to the connection between nature and the sensations that Sanja is about to experience: "Quivering smoky-blue berries poured out, plump and dangling, and dazzled the eye, arousing wonder, and delight, and guilt, and something else that Sanja didn't know by name and that impressed all this upon him with a feeling that bound everything together-a vague and benevolent feel- ing" (28). By the end of the story the berries, ruined by human contact and turned to poison, become a symbol of evil and shattered innocence. Other patterns of symbolism, especially those pertaining to journeys, boundaries, daylight, and darkness, are equally complicated. Stylistically "Live and Live" is also a good deal more complex than Ras- putin's previous works. Instead of short concrete sentences and a generous amount of dialogue, this story unfolds through long, convoluted sentences forming lengthy complicated paragraphs that reflect the complexity and nebulousness of its philosophical concepts. Vague words abound; the text is replete with eto-nibud', eto-to, kak-to, and similar pronominal forms (e.g., 35-36), as well as slovno, kazalos', and Cudilos'. It also contains an unusually large number of questions (e.g., 30-31), which reflect the uncertainty of youth and the impossibility of completely comprehending the mysteries of life. Religious terms such as vsesil'noe 'all-powerful' (31), vseslaven 'all-glorious' (35), and vysen 'divine' (35) creep into descriptions of Sanja's mystical vision and his reflections afterwards. Peasant speech and local dialect are kept to a minimum as the point of view alternates between Sanja's psychological stance and that of an omniscient narrator with a grasp of history and phi- losophy far exceeding an adolescent's. The narrator occasionally offers publicistic commentary (14), but the overall tone of the story is a mixture of the haziness of adolescent conceptions, the abstractness of philosophy, and the mysteriousness of religious ecstasy. These stylistic devices form part</page><page sequence="14">546 Slavic and East European Journal of a complex artistic method designed to present complicated themes of a religious bent, all of which set this story apart from most works of village prose and especially from the tradition of socialist realism in which Rasputin began. Will Rasputin's path continue to lead in this direction? Recent evidence, including his latest novella, "Polar" (The fire),8 indicates a return to the style and thematic emphases of his previous tales as well as a concentration on nonfictional genres, such as the essay. Whatever direction it takes and for whatever reasons, "Live and Love" remains a fascinating exploration of the spiritual concerns that underlie all his works. With this story Rasputin, like his protagonist, has stepped across supposedly firm boundaries, pushing well beyond the accepted limits of socialist realism. "Live and Love" marks the clearest expression to date of his solution to the ills of contemporary life, an essentially religious solution that represents a distinct departure from Soviet literary tradition and provides proof that works of integrity, innova- tion, and vitality are not necessarily restricted to the emigre or underground press, but can be published under official auspices in Rasputin's homeland. NOTES 1 Between 1976 and 1982 Rasputin completed just four short stories, although he published several essays and newspaper articles on Siberia, Irkutsk, and Lake Baikal. His work was interrupted by an injury he sustained when he was mugged for his blue jeans in March 1980; this resulted in several periods of hospitalization, a number of operations, and continual severe headaches. While concentrating on short genres during his recuperation, he also continued work on two novellas, one of which, "Polar" (The fire), appeared in the July 1985 issue of Na? sovremennik. 2 Vek fivi-vek ljubi was originally published in 1982 by Molodaja gvardija. An English translation by Alan Myers appeared in 1985 in the collection You Live and Love and Other Stories. Page references to "Live and Love" in this article are to the Soviet edition; the translations are mine. 3 He has also stated that "it is good when a child is surrounded by fairy-tales. They shelter and develop his soul and prevent the cruel wind of grown-up life from dessicating it and covering it with a premature crust of 'worldly wisdom."' See "Valentin Rasputin: The Human Race is not Accidental." 4 See, for example, Afanas'ev, tales 75, 134, 139, and 295. 5 Bujan is referred to by name in Farewell to Matera when Dar'ja suddenly recalls the words of an "ancient and terrifying prayer of incantation" that begins: "On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan .. ." (Povesti, 234). The island of Matera itself bears a striking resemblance to descriptions of Bujan. 6 See, for example, "I desjat' mogil v tajge." Rasputin himself is partly of Tungus descent. 7 For excellent analyses of the religious symbolism in Rasputins's novellas, see Link and Mikkelson. 8 Starikova regards "Polar" as a direct continuation of Farewell to Matera.
