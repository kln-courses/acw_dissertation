<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kantian Respect for Minimally Rational Animals James Rocha Abstract: Immanuel Kant, in a much-maligned view, thought that we could only have indirect duties to nonhuman animals who have no inherent moral value since they lack rationality. While there are various responses to this worrisome position, no one seems to consider that animals could conceivably qualify as having rationality, even on Kantian high standards. Animals engage in various activities (such as playing, seeking revenge, and altruistically helping others) that could be taken as indicators of the core aspects of rationality that Kant requires for having absolute worth (such as a reflective self consciousness, a free end-setting ability, and the ability to make moral demands on oth ers). While these animal behaviors will not prove that animals are rational, we must re member that we also cannot prove that other humans are rational. Instead, my goal is only to provide a basis for a precautionary moral principle that requires treating animals as minimally rational, given that they might be. On this basis, we ought to accept some direct Kantian duties for the respectful treatment of animals. Keywords: animal rationality; duties to animals; Kant 1. Introduction Immanuel Kant infamously argues that humans only have indirect duties to nonhuman animals (from here on, just "animals")-' Since moral value, for Kant, derives from rationality, moral obligation is owed to rational beings, such as other humans. Were we to have any duties to animals, whom are taken to lack rationality, these duties would have to derive from duties to rational beings. Fortunately, Kant thought that our treat ment of animals affects our treatment of humans.

This claim, at the very least, requires strong empirical support.5 And for Kant, this claim is uncharacteristically contingent: if it turned out that torturing puppies somehow helped us to be a bit more honest, Kant could not forbid the torturing of puppies.6 Although there are many responses to Kant's thorny position, the re sponses, thus far, have accepted that animals are not rational. This prem ise seems reasonable enough, since no one has encountered any decisive evidence in favor of animal rationality. Nonetheless, we must remember that we cannot decisively prove that other humans are rational with any degree of certainty. Kant's own arguments for the possibility of moral action merely show that we must assume that we humans are rational if we are to have knowledge about the natural world.7 Our moral obliga tions, then, are largely based on a presumption of human rationality— though we do believe that we have a plethora of good indicators for hu man rationality. Given the fragile basis (epistemically, not psychologically, speaking) for belief in our own rationality, we ought to consider whether possible indicators of animal rationality could ground a similar presumption. Of course, these cases are not entirely analogous: indicators for human ra tionality include the use of language, the development of science and 2 Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, p. 564 (6:443); Lectures on Ethics, pp. 434-35 (27:710). 3Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, pp. 517-19 (6:385-387). 4Alexander Broadie and Elizabeth M.

The evidence for animal rationality will definite ly be much less favorable. That said, scientific work on animal cognition increasingly points to wards heightened cognitive abilities.8 There are, of course, the well-known animals who appear to acquire language9 and adapt to human-like behav ior (such as Nim Chimpsky the chimp,10 Koko the gorilla,11 Kanzi the bonobo,12 and Akeakamai and Phoenix the dolphins13). There is also some evidence that some animals can think about their own thinking, which has largely been thought to be an exclusive ability of humans.14 As this sort of evidence develops, it may one day become clear that some 8Consider, as one example, "The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness," which was agreed upon by "cognitive neuroscientists, neuropharmacologists, neurophysiologists, neuroanatomists, and computational neuroscientists gathered at the University of Cam bridge."

Since we cannot rule out that possibility now, we may have good reason to work from a precautionary moral principle that we should act as if animals are rational—since, for all we know, they may be. In spite of what Kant thought about animals (based on the evidence available to him), today's scientific evidence should encourage Kantians today to accept this kind of precautionary moral principle in favor of di rect moral obligations to animals. Kant excluded rationality from animals, thus precluding our having direct duties to them, for two main reasons: they are not free and they lack self-consciousness. To spell out the Kant ian argument, I will rely on a particular interpretation, which derives from the work of Christine Korsgaard, where Kantian morality is based on rational agents' ability to confer value onto the world. I choose this interpretation for a few reasons. First, I think it is the correct interpreta tion of Kant. Second, it provides a rather exacting problem for counting animals as rational in the right sort of way: if morality is constitutive of a particularly human way of acting, then it would not make sense to apply morality to animals. Third, Korsgaard has offered an influential account of why animals should not count as rational on her view, even if she be lieves we can ground duties to animals in some other way.15 Finally, while I believe that we should accept the possibility that animals are ra tional on other interpretations of Kant, and even on other rationalist ac counts of morality, showing that animals may be rational on multiple accounts is beyond the reach of this paper. The positions of this paper will be limited to Kantians who accept Korsgaard's value theory. I will argue that the scientific evidence is suggestive that animals may be rational. I am only claiming here that the science provides indicators of potential animal rationality. We can neither definitively prove animal free will (nor human free will in any libertarian sense), nor animal self consciousness (we cannot see a pig's thoughts). For any given animal behavior that seems to imply rational thought, someone could possibly conceive some alternative instinctual/evolutionary explanation. At the same time, my goal is not to prove that animals are rational in the relevant ways, but that the evidence is good enough to warrant pre suming they are insofar as moral appraisal of our treatment of them is concerned. After all, humans regularly engage in actions that severely harm animals (eating meat, wearing leather, hunting, and so on). If it turned out that we owed moral duties to animals, then these would be grave moral transgressions. The goal here is merely to show that the evi dence is sufficiently open to the possibility of animal rationality that we 15Christine M. Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures: Kantian Ethics and Our Duties to Ani mals," The Tanner Lectures on Human Values 24 (2004): 77-110.</page><page sequence="5">Kantian Respect for Minimally Rational Animals 313 can no longer excuse our actions on any putative confidence that animals are not at all rational. 2. Relevant Aspects of Rationality To show why we ought to presume animals are rational on a Kantian pic ture, we must start with Kant's reasons for rejecting animal rationality. For Kant, moral duties are owed to "ends in themselves," with only ra tional beings qualifying as such. We cannot be obligated directly to ani mals if they are not ends in themselves. The first task, then, is to deter mine what aspects of rationality ground one's being an end in oneself. In presenting Kant's positions, I will work from a particular interpre tation that derives largely from Christine Korsgaard.16 The idea is that what makes a being into an end in itself is the ability to be a source of value in the world.17 Kant does not believe that objects in the world have inherent value. Instead, rational beings deem an object to be valuable by setting an end to obtain it. As Kant says in his argument that humans are ends in themselves: "The ends that a rational being proposes at his dis cretion as effects of his actions (material ends) are all only relative; for only their mere relation to a specially constituted faculty of desire on the part of the subject gives them their worth."18 Rational beings, through their faculties of desire, imbue objects with value by setting ends to ob tain them. This picture assumes a freedom to set the ends the agent chooses. Were ends set in some hardwired way, then the process would be predetermined to find certain objects valuable, and thus the value would not derive from the agent. Thus, a freedom to set one's own ends will be the first aspect of rationality in question. Additionally, for the agent to see herself as imbuing value onto ob jects, she must have a sense of her self. The second aspect will be a self conscious awareness of one's own agency. Kant points to this self consciousness as key to the distinction between humans and other ani mals: "The fact that man is aware of an ego-concept raises him infinitely above all other creatures on earth ... He is a being who, by reason of his preeminence and dignity, is wholly different from things, such as the ir rational animals whom he can master and rule at will."19 This self 16Christine M.

An animal, allegedly, does not see herself as having a desire for her self to be fed; she just wants food. A self-consciousness with an ego-concept is distinctive in its re flectivity: the agent sees herself as having ends, and she sees herself as distinct from her ends, such that she can critique, revise, and reject them.20 The first two steps in showing that humans are ends in themselves, and thus sources of moral duties, lie in these two aspects of rationality: a free ability to set ends and a reflective self-consciousness. My reflective self-consciousness and free end-setting ability allow me to choose what is to be of value and to see myself as doing so. Since any possible ob ject's value requires my first conferring it, my value is incomparable with any possible object's value.21 This, for Kant, is what it means to be an end in myself: I have value simply by existing, while objects only have value after someone confers it upon them. Since I see myself as an end in myself due to my rational end-setting ability, consistency requires that I recognize that other rational beings have this same ability, and so are ends in themselves. Since I have good reason to believe (though not definitive proof) that humans are rational beings, this argument applies to all humans. This point is both how we can derive morality from this way of thinking about value, and also how we gain our third relevant aspect of rationality: the ability to demand re spect from others. Humans, through both actions and words, confer value onto the world. Due to this ability, humans can expect that I both recog nize the value they put onto objects and respect their own absolute value that lies in their ability to do so. Thus, a being counts as rational in the right sort of way if it can freely set ends, has reflective self-consciousness, and can demand respect from other rational beings. While these three aspects of rationality gain hu mans the distinction of being ends in themselves, Kant did not think they applied to animals, leaving their worth merely relative: "Beings the ex istence of which rests not on our will but on nature, if they are beings without reason, still have only a relative worth, as means, and are there fore called things."22 Since animals, in Kant's mind, lack the three as pects of rationality, they cannot imbue themselves (or anything else) with value. Thus, animals can only be valuable if some end in itself, such as a human, deems them to be.

So, it is important to note that Korsgaard is willing to grant that (at least some) animals have a conception of their environment (which implies beliefs),23 have intelligence that is "characterized by [their] expe riences,"24 and have reasons that incentivize them to act.25 In spite of granting animals these abilities, Korsgaard agrees with Kant that animals lack the kind of rationality in question (Korsgaard believes we can ground moral obligations to animals through the animality of animals, but not through minimal rationality,26 as argued for here). While she agrees an ani mal may have an inner mental life, Korsgaard notes that it lacks the nec essary ego-concept: the animal simply chooses instinctively.27 While she is willing to grant intelligence, she means simply that an animal can adapt to changing circumstances by learning new practices.28 Animal intelli gence does not amount to rationality insofar as it is a fairly automatic pro cess: in her example, the animal stung by bees simply stops going near the bee hive—pain stimulates the response of avoidance, even though the animal is learning a new fact (avoid bee hives). It is not a matter of form ing a hypothesis, imagining different scenarios, and seeing ways to put itself into a preferable situation, which would amount to rationality.29 Though animals act from reasons for Korsgaard, these reasons are incen tives, not rational reasons.30 Thus, for Korsgaard, like for Kant, animals lack the relevant aspects of rationality to count as ends in themselves. 3. Evidence of Similarity: The Argument Structure In the sections that follow, I will outline some interesting and novel ani mal behaviors that I believe give some evidence of the aspects of ration ality in question. All the while, it must be kept in mind that we cannot enter the mind of a pig, a crow, or a dog, and so cannot prove that ani mals are free, have reflective self-consciousness, or make demands on us in the relevant sense. Further, all the described behaviors will be suscep tible to some kind of evolutionary explanation. Thus, the argument here 23Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures," p. 83; The Sources ofNormativity, p. 154. 24Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures," p. 83. 25Korsgaard, The Sources ofNormativity, p. 150. 26Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures," pp. 99-106; The Sources ofNormativity, pp. 152-53. 27Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures," pp. 88, 103-4; The Sources ofNormativity, pp. 149 55. 28Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures," p. 84. 29Ibid„ pp. 84-86. 30Korsgaard, The Sources ofNormativity, p. 150.</page><page sequence="8">316 James Rocha is not intended to deductively show that animals have the relevant as pects of rationality. Yet, the argument is meant to work within this limitation. First, it is to be remembered that some degree of limitation applies to our relevant knowledge of humans as well. We cannot know for sure that other hu mans are free or self-conscious, and evolutionary explanations could be provided to make a large number of human behaviors look instinctual.31 The key, then, is to determine what kind of burden we should be working under when examining the behavior in question. Tackling the burden question requires walking a fine line between two contrasting biases: anthropomorphism and speciesism. In terms of the former, we have learned that it is a bias to assume that just because an animal behavior is similar to a human behavior, then the animal is like humans in the rele vant respects. On the other hand, we also have a rather worrisome speciesist bias: humans receive pleasure from activities that require inflicting serious harms onto animals, and we would strongly prefer that we do not owe them moral duties. Lots of humans enjoy hunting for sport; many hu mans like the feel and look of wearing animal skin; some humans enjoy the forced display of animals in circuses, for sport, or at zoos; and most humans enjoy dining on animal flesh. Though these are different sorts of pleasures, in each case we are causing grave harms to animals for our own pleasure. And since the harm is usually kept quite distant from the pleasure (someone else slaughters what we eat), most humans are not at risk of becoming crueler to humans by indirectly partaking in animal suf fering. So, it is in our interest, really in the most vulgar sense, to believe that we do not owe moral duties to animals. Thus, while we ought to be wary of anthropomorphism, we need to remember that we are also strongly biased against accepting evidence for any animal/human simi larity that could lead to a moral duty to give up hunting, wearing leather, having animal-based circus shows, and eating meat. To deal with these competing biases, I will seek out animal behaviors that would be taken as evidence for rationality if found in humans whose rationality was uncertain. To avoid a straightforward charge of anthro pomorphism, 1 will not take mere similarity of behaviors to be evidence of rationality. The fact that humans and other animals both eat does not give good evidence that they eat in similar ways. Yet, we also would not take eating as evidence of rationality in other humans, especially ones whose rationality was in question, even though we do know that humans use rationality, in various ways, as part of the eating process. Thus, we jlK.orsgaard notes that the kind of freedom in question is precisely not the kind that can be discovered by scientists examining human behavior (ibid., p. 96).</page><page sequence="9">Kantian Respect for Minimally Rational Animals 317 are looking for human behaviors that would provide evidence for ration ality where that was an open question, such as with children at the earli est stages of rational development. Finding those types of behaviors in animals would provide similar evidence of animal rationality. This plan is also sensitive to the worry of a speciesist bias, because it treats the evidence similarly across similar cases: when rationality is in question in both cases, if the behavior counts as evidence for humans, it will be taken as providing evidence for animals as well. When we see rudimentary play in babies, we do not think it shows that they have al ready developed their rationality. Yet, as toddlers engage in more com plex play, such as that involving rule-following, we start to think that their rationality has begun to develop. As we will see, animals engage in complex play as well. Now, it may be possible to explain these similar behaviors differently, but why should we? The child's complex play is taken as evidence when the child has not already developed into a ration al being: we infer from the play's complexity to the child's development of rationality. Consistency would imply the same inference should be made for the animal. One might object that we make the inference for the child not just based on some specific behavior type, but also on the fact that the child is a member of a species that we know to be rational.32 While there is some truth to this point, when we make this inference, we do it for a giv en child, regardless of whether we have sufficient reason to think that that child is rational. The behaviors, in the child's case, are taken as good indicators of rationality because they specifically indicate rationality in that child's case: the child, who could have turned out to be incapable of rational behavior if some genetic predisposition precluded it, is doing something in a rational way that is best explained by imputing rationality to the child. If that is a good argument for the specific child, it is feasible to think it is likewise good for an animal performing the same behavior in a similar seemingly rational fashion. To think otherwise would risk stepping into a speciesist bias. Someone might also object that we don't actually impute rationality to toddlers; we merely talk in that fashion because we take toddlers to be future rational agents.33 It is not that the child is already rational, but we speak loosely in that fashion because we expect the child to become ra tional. I do not think that this objection accurately conveys how we nor mally act in particular instances when a specific toddler shows signs of rationality. When a toddler is at an age where it could turn out that she won't become a fully rational agent, and then she figures out a certain ,2I thank an anonymous reviewer for this objection. "I thank an anonymous reviewer for this objection.</page><page sequence="10">318 James Rocha way of playing a game, we compliment the toddler's reasoning abilities because she has demonstrated some rational development. We don't mean such a claim to be a shorthand reference for future rationality: we are actually impressed by the child's current, though limited, rational activity. Imagine the parents of a slowly developing child seeing behav ior that seems to indicate reasoning for the first time: they would surely be elated and judge their child to be rational. Such an imputation by these parents couldn't possibly be shorthand for an assumption, which they fear isn't warranted for their child, of future rationality. These imputa tions of early childhood rationality are based in the evidence of seeming ly reasoned behavior, and so the same type of behavior ought to lead to the same type of imputation when it comes to animal rationality. Thus, when we turn to relevant animal behaviors, we will seek out the type of behaviors that we would take as good evidence for a toddler's rationality. Just as it could turn out that the child in fact is unable to de velop her rationality in spite of seemingly rational behavior, such behav ior will also not prove that animals are rational. We are merely trying to establish a precautionary moral principle that we ought to treat animals as minimally rational because there is some evidence that they might be, we cannot prove they aren't, and it would cause us to engage in serious moral wrongs if we got this wrong. 4. Playing by the Rules I will look at behavior types that indicate novel end-setting, an ability to prioritize in a way that is not clearly instinct-based, and an ability to em pathize outside of one's own species. Instead of looking at the myriad of animal behaviors that support my argument, I will concentrate on three behavior types: play, revenge, and altruism. I will argue that these behav iors suggest the first two aspects of rationality: free end-setting and re flective self-consciousness. I will turn to the third aspect, the demand for respect, in my concluding remarks. Play indicates novel end-setting: play is done, nearly by definition, for fun, and not for some survival-based instinct. Further, the type of complex play we will examine will involve rule-following, which will suggest a complexity akin to Kantian requirements for rationality. Though not all animals play,34 animals of quite different species do, in cluding the animals we typically eat (chickens,35 cows, and pigs36) and 34Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce, Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), p. 117. 35Balcombe, Pleasurable Kingdom, p. 51. 36Marc Bekoff, The Emotional Lives of Animals (Novato, Cal.: New World Library,</page><page sequence="11">Kantian Respect for Minimally Rational Animals 319 the animals that typically test high on cognitive tests (primates, rodents,37 canids, felids, ungulates, pachyderms, and cetaceans38). Cats, chimpan zees, bears, and rats will play until they are exhausted.39 Chimpanzees who have learned sign language will have signed conversations with im aginary friends.40 A group of crows at a University of Washington foot ball game were witnessed using a ball of paper to mimic the players and play a crow version of football.41 None of these animals play in routine fashions as if programmed—their expressions indicate genuine happiness, including signs of laughter.42 Play suggests some level of rationality for at least four reasons. First, there is the blunt fact that play involves setting fun for its own sake as an end, which is some evidence for novel end-setting. Play is characterized by the lack of any deep-seated purpose—it is simply fun.43 The lack of a larger purpose is indicative of purposeful end-setting, since instinctively performed actions tend to have ends clearly set by nature. Animals eat to stave off hunger, and ultimately to stay alive. Animals flee predators to avoid serious harms. Sex, like play, may be directly for fun, but sex dif fers through its ultimate purpose to further gene lines. We can automati cally categorize those other activities as instinctual, unless we have inde pendent evidence that they are performed rationally. Second, the timing of play is further suggestive of a freedom to set ends, since nothing seems to stimulate a sudden urge to play. Animals eat when hungry, flee when afraid, and have sex when in heat. Since fun motivates play, it is harder to see it as naturally timed, and, thus, easier to see it as freely chosen. When toddlers choose to play with their food or desire to play with you in the middle of the night, we believe it is be cause they can choose to play whenever they like, not because instinct has any preference for those odd times. Third, play can be confusing since it often involves mimicking com mon activities, such as hunting, mating, or fighting, but without the usual 2007), pp. 54, 97. 37Sergio M. Pellis, "Keeping in Touch: Play Fighting and Social Knowledge," in Bekoff et al.

Pleasurable King dom, p. 68.</page><page sequence="12">320 James Rocha payoffs of those activities.44 This confusion highlights the subtlety in volved in being able to correctly distinguish between pretend fighting and actual fighting. We tend to infer that a child has advanced to a higher degree of intelligence when the child's mimicking of adult activities comes with an understanding that the child is merely pretending. And here, I do not mean "intelligence" in an instinctual sense as Korsgaard uses it, but in a sense connected to being rational: the child has made a rational discrimination by seeing her play as distinct from the adult activ ity she is mimicking. This doesn't entail that the animal (or the child) is making this rational discrimination, but, by this method of argumentation, if we were to take it as evidence of rationality in the child, it should count as some evidence of animal rationality. Fourth and finally, animal play often involves complex rule-following, including self-handicapping to level the playing field, temporary relin quishing of hierarchical statuses, and punishing rule-breakers.45 Animals appear to work diligently to ensure that winning at play mostly evens out, with no animal winning more than the other (however the animals see winning).46 For example, rats who retain an advantage will purposely lower their defenses in play to allow a weaker rat to have a successful play attack.47 As another example of rule-following, dogs have a bow that signals intent to play and allows them to apologize for mistakes dur ing play so that they can resume again within the ground rules.48 Viola tors of those ground rules (such as those who bite too hard or try to really mate instead of play-mating) face penalties, sometimes including expul sion from the group.49 Some animals cannot fit into groups merely be cause they cannot follow, or comprehend, the rules of play.50 These ani mals exhibit the level of rational understanding required to both compre hend rules and freely set the end to abide by them. Thus, their structured play is a good indicator of the type of rationality in question. When we witness play at this level of complexity in young children, 44Bekoff, The Emotional Lives of Animals, pp. 96-97; Bekoff and Pierce, Wild Justice, p. 117; Balcombe, Pleasurable Kingdom, p. 70. 45Bekoff, The Emotional Lives of Animals, pp. 87, 89-90, 92, 95-100; Bekoff and Pierce, Wild Justice, pp. 6, 14, 120-25; Frans de Waal, The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism among the Primates (New York: W.W.

Babies play in ways that are either overly simple or lack clear rules. Yet, consider the first time a child lets a friend win at a rudimen tary game. Or consider the first time two children find a way—a hug, a smile, or whatever—to express an apology for playing poorly. When children play at a complex level, we conclude that they are thinking about the game in a rational way because it is hard to see complex play as the mere result of instincts. As soon as play involves drawing subtle distinctions, communicating with partners, and deploying rudimentary notions of fairness and equity, we think children have developed into rational beings. Complex play in animals should be taken similarly. 5. Prioritizing Revenge Animal revenge can also indicate a certain amount of rationality. While there have been verified cases of monkey, chimpanzee, and baboon re venge that exhibit expert precision (some of these animals accurately target the individuals who have wronged them in proportion to how much they were wronged),511 will concentrate on an extended study of crow revenge. To test the theory that crows engage in revenge, wildlife biologist John Marzluff and his team of researchers donned two sets of masks.52 One group wore masks that would be marked as "dangerous" as they were the ones to capture the crows, while another group wore neutral masks and left the crows alone. Upon release, the crows consistently scolded people in the dangerous masks and left the neutral masks alone. The crows even seemed to communicate which masks were dangerous to other crows, since the quantity of angry crows increased over time. They even parceled out their revenge differently based on patterns of human behavior: in rural areas, where humans shoot crows, they screamed from a distance; in cities, where crow-shooting is less common, they would get right in the faces of the researchers in dangerous masks.53 As Marz luff and his co-author, Tony Angell, argue, 51 Joan B. Silk, "The Patterning of Intervention among Male Bonnet Macaques: Reci procity, Revenge, and Loyalty," Current Anthropology 33 (1992): 318-25, see esp. pp. 319, 321-24; Bekoff, The Emotional Lives of Animals, p. 81; Michael Tomasello and Joseph Call, Primate Cognition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 209; de Waal, The Bonobo and the Atheist, pp. 76-79. 52Marzluff and Angell, Gifts of the Crow, pp. 169-92; Michele Nijhuis, "Friend or Foe?

"Nijhuis, "Friend or Foe?"</page><page sequence="14">322 James Rocha While the noise of a boisterous mob surrounding and diving at a malevolent person may involve reflexive, nonthinking activities commanded by a crow's midbrain, the decision to join a mob, the acquisition of knowledge concerning danger, and the ability to use this knowledge to recognize a person requires thought.54 To be more precise, this revenge study can be taken as evidence of an ability to track faces, a readiness to scold offending humans, an ability to communicate information, and perhaps an ego-concept. While the first few claims derive directly from the experiment's results, the contentious claim is the ego-concept. Automatic revenge is unlikely to provide much evidence of anything beyond instinct: you hit me, and I instinctively strike back. Yet, the crows were engaged in a patient and consistent re venge activity: they retained their anger over time and continued to scream at their offenders. This behavior could be hardwired by instinct, but the competitive advantage is minimal, if it exists at all. The crows are placing themselves in extra danger. They are unlikely to be scaring hu mans into no longer attacking them, and even if they were, it is unclear how much advantage the crows gain from merely scaring the humans who happened to have captured them and let them go. Instead, it appears that the crows are seeking to establish their dis pleasure. They appear to have a sense that they have been wronged, and they want to wrong the violators back. Again, we cannot know this for sure, but we would surely think it if we saw small children engage in sus tained acts of revenge. When a toddler lashes out immediately at a parent for some perceived slight, it may not be a sign of the child's rationality, but when a young child begins to hold a long-term grudge over a per ceived slight, we would think the child is conceiving the situation in a complex fashion. It is plausible to infer that the child sees her self as hav ing been wronged, at least in the loose sense that she understands that she, as an individual, is the object of the wronging. Further, she likely sees her various attempts to vex her parents as their desert because she thinks her tantrums will upset their selves, again in the loose sense that they are individuals who are distinct from her. We would conclude that the child's grudge indicates both some level of an ego-concept and a poten tial understanding that other beings have mental lives. This doesn't prove that the child has either a fully developed ego-concept or a clear under standing of others' mental lives, and so it will not prove as much with the crows either. Yet, consistency implies that were we to be inclined to infer these aspects of rationality for the child, then we ought to be open to drawing the same inferences for the crows. Revenge also suggests a possible poor prioritization of values, since it 54Marzluff and Angell, Gifts of the Crow, p. 179.</page><page sequence="15">Kantian Respect for Minimally Rational Animals 323 isn't clearly in the crow's interests. Yet, poor prioritization implies an ability to prioritize, which suggests a possible free end-setting: the crow is forsaking more natural urges in favor of something as abstract as seek ing revenge as an end. Revenge involves rearranging what's important to prioritize the bruised ego, suggesting the possibility of both reflective self-consciousness and free end-setting. 6. Selfless Animals It is perhaps uncontroversial that animals engage in altruistic behavior, but it is thought that long-term self-interest motivates it, since altruism today will hopefully be paid back in the future. For this reason, we can not prove that animal altruism is morally motivated even if it extends beyond kin.55 Of course, Kant points out that we have the same problem for locating examples of human actions that are undoubtedly done from duty: there is always a possible ulterior motive available to explain a human's putatively moral action.56 Just as Kant sought out cases where self-interest was most likely silent to pinpoint moral human actions,57 we should seek out examples of animal altruism where self-interest is not the most plausible explanation. Two types of cases work well in this regard: interspecies altruism and self-sacrificing altruism. There are a plethora of cases of interspecies altruism where it is hard to imagine that animals are hardwired to expect reciprocity from animals from different species. We don't even need to concentrate on dogs and their human partners. There are plenty of cases of interspecies altruism without humans: wild elephants rescue captive antelopes by undoing multiple latches on enclosure gates,58 a cat becomes the caregiver for a blind dog,59 or a steer becomes the caregiver for a blind mule.60 These cases suggest that animals can see the plight of others, who are not like them, as in some sense placing demands on them, and they respond posi tively to those demands. This behavior suggests novel end-setting, since the animals set the end of helping others with whom they have nothing in common. If they do this with no possible hope of receiving help, then that's genuine altruism. If they hope for long-term assistance from the helped animal, then that implies they can think about an animal from an other species in an interesting light. The animal is unlikely to be hard 55Silk, "The Patterning of Intervention," p. 318. 56Kant, Groundwork, pp. 61-62 (4:406-407). 57See, for example, Kant's infamous shopkeeper case (Groundwork, p. 53 (4:397)). '8Bekoff and Pierce, Wild Justice, p. ix. 59Ibid. 60Bekoff, The Emotional Lives of Animals, p. 75.</page><page sequence="16">324 James Rocha wired to think positively of animals from other species, and they are un likely to have learned that a distinct animal species is good at paying back assistance. If it is not genuine altruism, then we would have a kind of learning that goes beyond what Korsgaard allows: it is not merely re peated experience, but drawing an inference that this animal is likely to be helpful down the line even if the animal is not even from the same species. We may, though, have an even better case of altruism when self sacrifice is required. Russell Church performed an infamous experiment to determine if a rat would stop pulling a lever that delivered both food to the rat pulling the lever and a shock to a nearby rat. It turned out that the rats consistently stopped pulling the lever.61 Two possible explanations are plausible. First, the rats gave up food because they saw it was hurting another rat. Second, the rats thought that pulling the lever would eventu ally hurt them.62 While the first explanation suggests authentic altruism, even the second suggests a kind of reasoning that goes beyond the learn ing that Korsgaard allows under "animal intelligence." This reasoning would be a bit irrational (no evidence suggests that the lever-pulling rat will be harmed in the future), but it would be reasoning since the infer ence of a possible future harm wouldn't be the mere recollection of a past harm: the rat would be fearing a hypothesized future. Just to reinforce this point, it may be useful to note similar results in other experiments: in one, rhesus monkeys also refused food if taking the food meant that other monkeys would be shocked,63 and, further, mole rats will fight a snake so that the rest of their group can escape—thus facing certain death to save others.64 Self-sacrifice cases are interesting because in some cases, like the mole rat, future payback is unlikely or impossible, while in other cases, it is a difficult calculation whether sac rifice makes sense. Altruism without major sacrifice (a mere grooming) is a safe gamble, and it makes sense to have an instinct hardwired for it. With major sacrifice, altruism is much riskier and is likely to be true al truism or a calculation (even if sometimes a poorly made one). These cases of altruism suggest animal rationality even if the behav iors are open to interpretation. In both interspecies altruism and self sacrifice altruism, if the altruism were genuine, then it would be a para digm case of free end-setting in that it would be for a moral end, in some 61Frans B.M. de Waal, "Do Animals Feel Empathy?" Scientific American Mind, vol. 18, issue 6 (December 2007/January 2008). 62Ibid. 63Ibid. 64Zhanna Reznikova, Animal Intelligence: From Individual to Social Cognition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 384.</page><page sequence="17">Kantian Respect for Minimally Rational Animals 325 sense. The animal would be setting an end to help others because the an imal in some way felt a sense of duty to do so. If the interspecies altruism were not genuine, then the animal is reasoning about an animal that is quite different from itself. The animal would be calculating that an ani mal from a different species would likely return a favor in the future. To set an end based on such a calculation would likewise count as free end setting, because the animal would not be merely following instincts. Fi nally, if the self-sacrifice altruism were not genuine, then the animal again is making a calculation. The animal is determining that the poten tial future pay-off is worth the current costs. Once again, the animal sets an end based on a calculation, which would make it count as free end setting since it would not appear to reduce to following instincts. Thus, these cases of altruism provide good evidence for animal rationality. 7. Animals Demanding Respect We have seen three types of animal behavior (play, revenge, and altru ism) that suggest at least two of the relevant aspects of rationality for animals counting as ends in themselves. One minimal condition for ra tionality is reflective self-consciousness: the animal must be able to iden tify itself as an individual and use this ego-concept to stand apart from her ends. This suggests the second aspect: the animal must be free to choose its own ends and not be determined by natural instincts to value certain objects. Yet, play, revenge, and altruism suggest a kind of end prioritization, since animals must drop ends that are more directly linked to their basic instincts to engage in play for the end of fun, to harm others for the end of revenge, or to help others by seeing those others as ends (or, at least, calculating that those others can be long-term useful in spite of current, contrary evidence). These activities suggest prioritization in a way that implies at least a good possibility of both reflective self consciousness and free end-setting. Importantly, all three behaviors occur in fashions that indicate ration al processes, even if poor or minimal ones. Play requires rule-following and avoiding confusion with structurally similar activities. Long-term revenge can require planning, keeping in mind who has wronged you, and, in the crow's case of screaming, a possibly abstract understanding of how your actions are likely to harm your victim. Altruism across spe cies or involving self-sacrifice may either be genuine altruism or involve either, respectively, intriguing reasoning about species that appear differ ent from the helping animal or reasoning about how the self-sacrifice may pay off even when it incurs costs. Thus, we have evidence from all three behavior types that at least some animals may be able to freely set</page><page sequence="18">326 James Rocha ends in a self-conscious way that confers value onto objects in the world. I have saved the third aspect of rationality—the ability to make a de mand on others to respect your ends—until now since I believe it is sim pler to meet than it seems. It may appear to be the hardest aspect to es tablish, since animals cannot make verbal demands on us. Yet, we have to be careful not to take this requirement too literally. Our moral duties don't wait to kick in until a person says: "I demand you respect me!" What it means for humans to demand respect from each other is for them to exhibit—usually nonverbally through their behavior—that they are vul nerable, rational beings, as far as we can tell. I am, thus, using "demand" rather loosely here: any display or sign that one ought to receive respect counts as a demand in this sense. Nonverbal behavior that indicates vul nerability and rationality is sufficient for providing such a demand, and thus sufficient to establish that moral duties are owed to a being. Animals, through everyday behavior and regular interaction with hu mans, can obviously express vulnerability, and, based on the arguments given here, may be expressing a possibility of minimal rationality. Ani mal actions are similar to actions that are taken to be rational when per formed by young, human children. Thus, there is a relevant parallel: where human action provides grounds for an inference of rationality, and thus a ground for moral duty, similar actions by animals should also yield moral duties. This point of analogy follows even if we might be wrong about the animal actions. When we see a human, such as a toddler, perform a certain behavior, we can infer that she is likely rational. That inference does not grant certainty, but it is sufficient for us to realize that we have a moral duty to that potentially rational human. If an animal per forms the same behavior, then consistency requires that we become open to the possibility that the animal is rational. Of course, we can still inquire whether these arguments establish a sufficiently high possibility of animal rationality to ground moral obliga tions on a Kantian moral theory. Korsgaard determined that the possibil ity of animal rationality was too low to ground moral duties. Yet, contra ry to Korsgaard's position, I believe the arguments here have shown that there is a relatively good chance that animals are not driven purely by instinct, but instead have some level of self-conscious and free end setting, at least similar to the levels enjoyed by minimally rational tod dlers. Perhaps these arguments do not establish that animals are probably rational, but I think I have shown that the possibility of their rationality —given just the current state of the scientific evidence—is sufficiently high that we would have no rational excuse for treating the animal in a seriously immoral way if the animal turned out, later, to be rational. Since there is a good possibility of animal rationality, we should take the</page><page sequence="19">Kantian Respect for Minimally Rational Animals 327 precaution of accepting moral duties to animals. We then have a good case for a precautionary moral principle. Ani mals perform behaviors that would be taken to indicate rationality if a toddler performed them. These behaviors, for all we know, may be indi cating rationality in animals (perhaps on the level of a toddler, though still with the relevant aspects of rationality to ground moral duties). We cannot rule out moral duties just because the evidence is uncertain: if the possibility of grave moral wrongs is at stake, morality demands that we err on the side of more duties, not fewer. Thus, we have good reason, out of precaution, to treat animals as if they are minimally rational, because they might be. The paper admittedly comes with limits. I have not attempted to show that the precautionary principle applies to all animals, since not all ani mals engage in play, revenge, or the unique kinds of altruistic behavior discussed above. Of course, other behaviors could be substituted for those, and we will get a very long, if not exhaustive, list of animals that the precautionary principle applies to in the end. Nor have I argued that we can know that animals are rational—though we are not certain that other humans are rational either. We simply have good evidence that many animals have a good chance of having the aspects of rationality that would entitle them to be ends in themselves. That chance is high enough to require that we act as if animals are rational. Animals are still likely to turn out to have limited rationality, which may turn out to limit the strength and number of moral duties we have to them, though grave harms for our pleasure are likely to be ruled out fairly easily. Working this all out—what animals have minimal rationality, how rational those animals may be, what our duties should be to minimally rational animals, and so on—is quite a large project. For now, it is sufficient to say that moral precaution dictates that we at least treat animals with a minimal amount of respect.65 Department of Philosophy &amp; Religions Studies, Louisiana State University rocha@lsu.edu 65I would like to thank Jon Cogburn, Mona Rocha, and two anonymous reviewers for this journal for useful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.</page></plain_text>
