Artists lives. striking Both Eva similarities women Hesse and were in their Mira born professional Schendel in Europe, and share underwent personal many striking similarities in their professional and personal lives. Both women were born in Europe, underwent complicated flights from Nazism, and had international upbringings before finally settling in the Americas: Hesse in the United States in 1939 and Schendel in Brazil ten years later.1 Although Eva Hesse (1936-70) was nearly a generation younger than Mira Schendel (1919-88), the two artists embarked on their careers around the same time, and both attained their artistic stride and made their best-known works in the 1960s. Many of the works they produced in this decade are formally parallel to each other, employing devices such as hanging, seriality, transparency, fragility, and ephemerality. Each artist explored these similar concepts in vastly different milieus on separate continents, 2 likely remaining completely unaware of the other's work during this period.3 Yet, when considering their works together, parallel themes arise, specifically the ideas of the body and the void. Juxtaposing their works can provide valuable insights into the approaches of Hesse and Schendel by introducing an entirely new discourse into each artist's literature. Such juxtapositions are especially poignant when approaching artists active in Latin America such as Schendel, as the relative youth of the field of Latin American art history tends to result in lighter historiographies. The combination of artists' work from different backgrounds instantly opens up new layers of meaning that have not otherwise had time to incubate within a highly developed academic exchange. A similar approach was recently taken with the placement of Schendel's work alongside that of Argentine artist Leon Ferrari in the 2009 "Tangled Alphabets" exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art. Because of the lack of any significant artistic correspondence between Schendel and Ferrari, "Tangled Alphabets" ran the risk of being dismissed as a mere "juxtaposition show." In fact, in her review of the exhibition in The New York Times, Roberta Smith criticized the organizers for FALL / WINTER 2010 ф</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2.

With this in mind, a consideration of Schendel alongside an artist like Hesse, who does in fact come complete with a loaded scholarly historiography, can be fruitful in revealing insights into Schendel's work. In particular, the notion of the corporeal - a theme thoroughly explored in Hesse's bibliography - finds new life in the context of Schendel's oeuvre. By the same token, themes usually applied to Schendel's work, such as language and the void, will prove applicable to that of Hesse. The comparison is an apt one, as new viewers of Schendel's work often find Hesse to be the most readily available referent. Smith demonstrates this in her review by correlating Schendel's sculptural forms made of rice paper to Hesse's "resonant fusion of organic and geometric."5 Here, Smith is referring to Schendel's well-known series of Droguinhas ( Little Nothings) (1966; PI. 1), masses of twisted and knotted Japanese paper that can be suspended from the ceiling or piled casually on the floor. The state of entropy suggested by these objects provokes a comparison with certain of Hesse's pieces like the untitled rope installation from 1970 (PI. 2), which similarly relies on hanging and gravitational pull to determine its own form.6 The viewer of Schendel's Trenzinho ( Little Train ) (1965: PI. 3 and Fig. 1) might also call to mind a work like Hesse's Contingent (1969; front cover and Fig. 2) in their shared sense of suspended precariousness, as Schendel's accumulation of blank sheets of rice paper flutter slightly in a similar manner to that of Hesse's fiberglass and latex panels. More is at play here, however, than a mere morphological affinity, as notions of the body, the void, and language pervade the oeuvre of both artists. Analogies with the corporeal have been the most common points of entry in Hesse scholarship since its inception. Despite Hesse's often ambivalent position about the role of the body in her works, critics continuously have perceived organic dimensions in her forms and materials. The panels of cheesecloth covered in layers of latex and fiberglass in Contingent , for example, evoke the translucent fleshiness of human skin, while the various coils of the rope piece suggest disembodied sinews or entrails. An early proponent of the body metaphor in Hesse's work was the critic Lucy Lippard, who included Hesse in her 1966 exhibition "Eccentric Abstraction" at New York's Fischbach Gallery. For Lippard, the artists included in this group show offered an alternative to industrial, "dead- set Minimalism," by reintroducing a tactile, sensual, and erotic dimension into their production.7 When Lippard decided to include Hesse in the show, she likely had in mind her recent works such as the 1965 relief Ringaround Arosie (Fig. 3), whose pink coloring and concentric, protruding forms have obvious (yet ambiguous) erotic connotations.8 Contrary to Lippard's expectations, Hesse instead contributed Metronomic Irregularity U (1966), which was made of square panels connected by tangled wires, departing from the organic metaphors of the earlier reliefs or the phallic, sausage-like forms of a work like Several (1965). Despite the artist's seeming shift away from literal allusions to the body, Lippard continued to develop her view of Hesse's forms in her 1976 monograph on the artist in terms of a humorous and threatening eroticism. While not consciously anthropomorphizing, Hesse's work evoked the Freudian concept of the body-ego, in which the viewer's body is felt to be identified with, or related to, the abstract form in a visceral way.4 Many subsequent scholars and critics have continued to construct complicated body theories around Hesse's works. Rosalind Krauss considered Hesse's objects to be "desiring machines," relating them to Gilles Deleuze's and Félix Guattari's concept of the "Anti-Oedipus," in which the "threatened paranoid body" becomes deterritorialized and amorphous: a "body without organs."10 For his part, James Meyer has written of a "despecification of the body," where the various body parts suggested by Hesse's forms are severed from their recognizable context, becoming part-objects that fail to form an intact whole.11 Most recently, both Briony Fer and Yve-Alain Bois have stressed a certain non-literal bodily presence in Hesse's works: for Bois, this "tenuous bodilyness" is most akin to a recently detached toenail, something once ф WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3.

While the industrial steel rejects comparison with the human body, the interior is so inviting that it even provoked a spectator's attempts to climb inside the piece at an early showing. In addition to their attractive/repulsive qualities, some of Hesse's works, especially those constructed out of latex - an unstable medium which caused works like Contingent to yellow, become brittle, and deteriorate over time - also evoke the grotesque. This deterioration is analogous to the decay suffered by the human body as it ages, an element which has prompted the notion that the ephemerality of Hesse's works was connected to her own approaching mortality.14 This assumption again has been made regardless of the position of Hesse herself, who was ambivalent about the conservation and longevity issues of her pieces: although aware of the problems posed by the latex, she Fig. 4.

Courtesy the Estate of Eva Hesse, Galerie Hauser &amp; Wirth, Zürich. found its unstable material properties intriguing but was not sure how she felt about its impermanence.15 Despite the fact that she was working on these latex pieces during the height of her illness, the idea that Hesse was projecting her own immanent mortality onto her works is symptomatic of a wider problematic tendency to romanticize the artist's biography that is best avoided. In addition to the numerous corporeal metaphors advanced by critics, the body is reintroduced to the works in a secondary way due to their phenomenological aspects. Similar to that of other Minimalist and Post-Minimalist artists operating at the time, Hesse's work can be related to Maurice Merleau-Ponty7 s ideas on phenomenology as put forward in his Phenomenology of Perception of 1945, which stressed the active role of the human body in perceiving the world. Artists took up the idea of the eye as part of a body that is situated in relation to its wider physical environment by creating complex works that invited the spectator's movement around them. Because the perception of a work is made infinitely changeable as the observer moves around it, an element of temporality is introduced into the act of viewing. Hesse's rope piece demonstrates this concept by refusing to look the same from any two angles; Contingent, too, promotes active viewing by its suspension in space, requiring the viewer to move around the work to take in the various configurations of the panels in FALL /WINTER 2010 Q</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 5.

Ada Schendel Collection. relation to one another. Furthermore, due to the lightness of the hanging membranes, they are disturbed by the movement of the viewer in a similar way as is Schendel's Trenzinho, which fluctuates due to shifting air currents and even the spectator's breath, giving the impression that the work is itself a breathing organism. A phenomenological reading is central to Schendel's practice as well as to Hesse's, both in the Trenzinho and even more overtly in her late 1960s series of Objetos Gráficos (Graphic Objects) (Fig. 5), consisting of sheets of rice paper covered in lettering, sandwiched between two panels of suspended clear acrylic. By moving the objects away from the wall and hanging them in the center of the room, Schendel encouraged the viewer to move around the works to experience them from all angles. This practice finds parallels in works like the Spatial Reliefs of her Brazilian contemporary Hélio Oiticica, which also partake of a phenomenological dialogue in giving three- dimensional form to color in space. This experiential aspect is even more apparent in his Núcleos, which become enterable environments. Likewise, the Objetos Gráficos approach the environmental as displayed in the 1968 Venice Biennale (Fig. 6). Here, the works were installed in overlapping arrangements that allowed them to be viewed through one another, also permitting glimpses of passing spectators and the surrounding environment, both inside the gallery as well as from the outdoors via the nearby wall of windows.16 The transparency of the acrylic plates denies the frontality of the works on paper within each Objeto Gráfico. In addition, the encased sheets of paper are oriented in both directions and are so thin that writing is visible in reverse through their translucent surfaces, negating a front/back opposition. The Fig. 6. Mira Schendel, Objetos Gráficos (Graphic Objects) (1968) installation at 1968 Venice Biennale. О Max Schendel. ability of the viewer to read the lettering from the back and the front - and both simultaneously - denies the two- dimensionality of the word and lends it a new corporeality: letters are no longer flat elements applied to a surface, but exist in three-dimensional space. According to Luis Pérez-Oramas, the Objetos Gráficos are part of Schendel's application of a thickness to language: in essence, she gives it a body.17 While for Hesse the body is suggested through visual affinities with anthropomorphic forms, for Schendel notions of the corporeal emerge from her concern with the physicality of language. This focus on the physical qualities of language is demonstrated in the Objetos Gráficos through their recurrent inclusion of repetitions of the letter "A," which has ties to Brazilian Concrete poetry in the use of nonsensical arrangements of letters to create visual patterns rather than to convey intelligible meaning. These repetitions of the letter "A" also serve to evoke onomatopoeic utterances from human mouths, as well as the concept of origins in said letter's position as the inaugural character of the alphabet. Language, as discussed most effectively by Pérez-Oramas in his essay for "Tangled Alphabets," forms the backbone of Schendel's body of work. Her exploration of language was ongoing, stemming from her early forays into poetry and philosophy and pervading her work both literally (in the Objetos Gráficos ) and figuratively (in the Droguinhas, as discussed below). In the Objetos Gráficos, Schendel excerpts passages from diverse sources, including philosophy, poetry, and popular song lyrics. Language similarly becomes the primary content for her series of Monotipias (Monotypes), produced throughout the 1960s. Schendel produced dozens of these unique works by inking a glass plate with oil over which talcum powder was sprinkled; on top was placed a sheet of thin rice paper onto which the oil was transferred through the use of the artist's fingernail or other small tool. In addition to subtle lines and other abstract shapes, writing is a major component of this ф WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 7.

One such work known as A trama (A fabric net) (Fig. 7) differs from the other monotypes in terms of its horizontal format and possession of a title, but it incorporates many typical components of the series, including fragments of words and phrases that coexist with abstract spirals and symbols, configurations of lines, and indecipherable scribbles. Hesse, too, maintained a longtime interest in language, but this dimension rarely emerged as a literal subject in her art as it did in Schendel' s. Instead, her verbal experiments were confined to her copious diaries and notebooks, in which language was explored as an equivalent to her artistic practices.18 Many of the titles for Hesse's pieces result from these exercises, and indeed she invested a high degree of Fig. 9. Mira Schendel, Untitled ( 1964), oil transfer drawing on Japanese paper, 18 Vi" x 9 1/8". Collection Marcela and Israel Furmanovich. meaning in her titles, disliking the unimportance suggested by leaving a work unnamed.19 Many of her titles are ambiguous and refrain from identifying any specific content in the work, but others are significant in suggesting an active dimension in the work, such as Accretion, which signals the completion of the process involved in its making.20 Writing does appear in some of Hesse's early works on paper, however, as in a drawing from 1962 (Fig. 8), which suggests a proto-cognitive form of written language similar to that appearing in Schendel's A trama monotype. Here, Hesse's Twombly-esque scribbles - possibly inspired by Surrealist experiments in automatic writing21 - vary in degree of aggressiveness, suggesting the presence of multiple hands in the work.22 The presence of the hand ties the body to these drawings, since the traces and marks made on the paper are the process FALL / WINTER 201 0 ф</page><page sequence="6">of encoding a series of gestures made as the arm and hand extend away from the bodily axis.23 Indeed, the gesture is an important notion for Schendel's monotypes, some of which are so subtle that the entire work becomes about one or two such simple gestures (1964; Fig. 9). The fact that the artist often used only her fingernail to impress the ink into the paper furthers this inscription of the body upon the work. As contact is made and the ink soaks into the paper, the gesture becomes fused into the support rather than lying on its surface: the traces seem to emerge from within the paper itself in a similar way that marks appear on living organisms from within, like a blemish or a bruise.24 In addition to the small format of the works on the hand's scale and the use of a part of the artist's body itself as a mark-making tool, the body is further conferred onto Schendel's monotypes in subtle stained areas where the slight pressure from the artist's resting hand attracted a degree of ink as she worked.25 In the monotypes, the trace left by the gesture suggests the body's innate expressiveness by embedding the residue of its actions within the surface of the paper.26 This process takes place to an even greater extent in the Droguinhas, which become visual records of every action deposited in them: each gesture of the maker in twisting and knotting the rice paper is apparent. In fact, the gesture can be seen as both the primary subject matter and intent of the Droguinhas , as Schendel's objective was not in the creation of a finalized object. Rather, she envisioned the making of the Droguinhas as a temporary exercise with the end result of a transitory, disposable thing: this condition is underlined by her use of the term droguinha, which is slang in Brazil for something of no importance, a "mere trifle" that can be thrown away. This "throw-away" quality is apparent in the objects themselves in their humble materiality, resembling so many wads of tissue paper to be cast aside. Schendel clarified her feelings on this issue in a 1977 statement in which she identifies impermanence and ephemerality as the primary conditions of the Droguinhas : for her, the Droguinha was an "ephemeral object, an object exposed in a way to transitoriness, just as in life."27 That the Droguinha should operate "in life" confers upon it status as a living - and dying - thing: thus these works can be viewed as analogies for the human condition in a way that is similar to the element of mortality that is often ascribed to Hesse's sculptures. In Hesse's case, the transitoriness of her objects stems from the instability of their materials, prone to disintegrate and decay over time, as opposed to the intentional ephemerality of Schendel's approach to the Droguinhas as a series of actions. Obvious museological problems are posed by both groups of objects on account of this quality: Hesse's works present constant conservation challenges as their appearance deviates further and further from their original state, while the Droguinhas have been preserved as commodity objects in clear opposition to the artist's intentions. Nevertheless, the preservation of these objects and their continued display is vital for subsequent generations to view and understand the works and their implications. For example, by including the Droguinhas in "Tangled Alphabets," Pérez- Oramas was able to illustrate their relation to his theories on Schendel's use of language. For him, each knot and twist in the Droguinhas is like a word that, when connected to others, builds up to form a string of words or a coherent phrase.28 Language becomes materialized in this way, or, in other words, is given a body as it was in the Objetos Gráficos. Rather than through the latter' s inscription of actual letters and word fragments, however, the Droguinhas' s language is rendered mute. The fact that its language fails to be understandable is underlined by the fact that in Portuguese droguinha can also be used to mean "senseless," an appropriate description for these indecipherable masses.29 In Pérez-Oramas's view, the muteness embodied by the Droguinhas is likened to the silence that lingers after a voice or voices have faded away - voices that have inscribed their words onto the surface of the object and are no longer present. The Trenzinho, on the other hand, presents another kind of muteness: an expectant silence awaiting the inscription of the word. Pérez-Oramas notes something ominous in the silent anticipation of the Trenzinho : translated as "little train," the work reminds him of the passenger trains carrying away detainees to unknown destinations during the Holocaust.30 The silence emitted by the Trenzinho is heightened by its repetition of the blank page, normally the vehicle for written language (as in the monotypes, which also employ the same format of rice paper), now presented in multiple, and gaining meaning through blankness itself. This quality of blankness or emptiness is prevalent throughout Schendel's oeuvre, apparent both in her sculptural objects and works on paper. For example, in the monotypes the majority of the field of paper is left blank, with a few subtle gestures only serving to emphasize the surrounding emptiness. Schendel herself spoke of this quality in a 1965 letter written to critic Guy Brett: "I would say the line, often, just stimulates the void. I doubt whether the word stimulate is right. Something like that. At any rate what matters in my work is the void, actively the void."31 In response to statements like this one, scholarship on Schendel has adopted the void as a key concept in her works: in fact, "the void" has become the go-to theme in Schendel's somewhat briefer historiography in the same way that "the body" has served for Hesse. Notably, Sonia Saltzstein organized an exhibition of Schendel's works in 1996 under the title "No Vazio do Mundo " lifted from an Italian phrase found in one of the monotypes (1964; Fig. 10), translating to "In the void of the world." For Salzstein, the void - as manifested through Schendel's use of transparency in works like the Objetos Gráficos as well as the 1969 Still Waves of Probability, a Penetrable- like32 installation of translucent nylon threads suspended from the ceiling - embodies ideas of empowerment and renewal. In Saltzstein's view, the "void of the world" operates as a site for potential, a place where everything ends and begins again.33 The literal passage through Still Waves of Probability or a visual one through an Objeto Gráfico is a circular process of becoming: the confrontation with the void provoking inquiry into the viewer's position in relation to it.34 Guy Brett also notes the void's transformative potential in his essay "Actively the Void," but goes further in relating Schendel's interest to that of a wider spectrum of her artistic ф WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 10 (left). Mira Schendel, Untitled (1964), oil transfer drawing on Japanese paper, 18 1/8" X 9". Collection Cesare Rivetti. contemporaries, both in Latin America and elsewhere.35 Moreover, Brett maintains that notions of the void held a particular attraction in Brazil because of the void's ability to express "the contradiction, the clash - but as well the intimacy, the sense of longing - existing between the cosmic and the tropical, the philosophical and the political, the metaphysical and material."36 Although this view of Brazil's penchant for contradiction is somewhat problematic, Brett likely had in mind a work like Oiticica's Tropicália, first exhibited in Rio de Janeiro in 1967 - an installation of labyrinth-like cabins and tropical elements including sand, plants, and live parrots. The spectators' tactile-sensorial experience in traversing the labyrinth would culminate in their arriving in a dark, interior room (a void), where they were then instructed to riff into a microphone on the concept of "nothingness." For Oiticica, this journey was meant to evoke a sense of being devoured, a process central to the Brazilian concept of antropofagia which holds that the culture of Brazil was formed through the "cannibalistic" consumption of other cultures.37 Here, too, the void becomes a site with the potential for transformation and new beginnings.

Courtesy the Estate of Eva Hesse, Galerie Hauser &amp; Wirth, Zürich. As we have seen, the void for Schendel is evoked by her use of empty space and transparency. A certain transparency is also present in Hesse works in the obvious construction of her materials: if the panels of Contingent relate to bodies then they must by extension be naked ones, as the layering of the latex leaves exposed every detail of the technique involved and the underlying support. A more literal blankness is found in a work like Hang-up (1966; Fig. 11), whose steel wire projects exaggeratedly out from a wrapped picture frame that offers a view onto nothing but the white gallery wall behind it. Briony Fer has noted an economy of loss in Hang-up and other of Hesse's works employing emptiness in relation to Melanie Klein's metaphor of blank space put forward in her 1929 essay "Infantile Anxiety Situations," a new take on Sigmund Freud's theories on infantile sexuality now focusing on the female experience. In the female version of castration anxiety, the young girl desires to rob the mother's body of its contents, which then leads to the fear that the girl's own body will also be mutilated.38 In Klein's metaphor, blank space is equated with the site of lack within the body that relates to the loss and mourning of the maternal object, an empty space that can FALL /WINTER 2010 ф</page><page sequence="8">never be filled.39 Fer recognizes this drama of the loss of self and the threatened body within Hesse's works, and connects the artist's subconscious interest in the destruction of the mother with the loss of her own mother at an early age. Even more resonant in Hesse's works than literal emptiness, however, is the concept of "nothingness" subsumed under the void. In fact, the word "nothing" is often applied to her art: fellow artist and friend Mel Bochner wrote of her method as one in which "nothing is incarnated into nothing."40 Hesse, too, often referred to her own art as "nothing," or to the contradictory state of her pieces as at once "something and nothing."41 The untitled rope piece from 1970 exemplifies this paradox of simultaneous "somethingness" and "nothingness": conceived as the "ugly" counterpart to the more evanescent 1969 hanging piece Right After , to which she once referred as "a big nothing,"42 the untitled piece could be described similarly. As it is spread throughout the room, the rope piece is thinned out, denying the dense materiality of its latex-covered cords.43 It has no inside or outside, top or bottom, front or back; its surface is entirely refuted, evoking "void" in its active sense as negation.44 Hence the body that is viscerally present in Hesse's rope piece is both diffused and negated: it becomes a "big nothing" to Schendel' s "little nothing" in the form of the Droguinha. That the notion of process is a factor in both works enhances their paradoxical nature, as laborious effort has gone into the making of a nothing: Schendel through her repeated gestures of twisting and knotting the rice paper, and Hesse in the dipping of her ropes in latex and their subsequent intertwining, knotting, and suspending. A certain obsessiveness is suggested by their methods, a quality often cited in Hesse's Accession series with its thousands of rubber elements threaded through perforated steel boxes. Beyond their biographical similarities as female exile artists or any formal affinities in their art, it is this state of paradox that unites the works of these two disparate artists: they are simultaneously somethings and nothings, corporeal and evanescent, like the body and unlike the body. Hesse's works such as Accession II embody both the industrial and the organic, facing the viewer with something both familiar and inviting yet strange and repulsive; others like Contingent remind one of human flesh, not warm and inviting but brittle and decaying. Thus Hesse's works are both of the body and not of the body, and are reminiscent of a "tenuous bodilyness" like Bois' s toenail. The body is made strange, or dissipated and deterritorialized into a "big nothing": it is negated, rendered void. Schendel, on the other hand, confers the bodily onto language, rendering it corporeal by giving it three- dimensionality. Blank space, too, is made corporeal, as traces of the gesture emerge from within the paper of the monotypes, or are sculpted into "little nothings" in the Droguinhas. While Schendel seems to wrest a body from the void, Hesse compromises - and makes void - this body once again. • Denise Birkhofer is a doctoral candidate at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University.

Schendel was born in Zurich, Switzerland, and spent her youth in Berlin and Milan; Hesse was born in Hamburg, Germany, and also lived in Holland and England before her family settled in America. 2. Hesse, who received artistic training under Josef Albers at Yale University and during a later sojourn in Germany, was deeply entrenched in the vibrant New York art scene. Schendel, on the other hand, mostly pursued her artistic interests independently before settling into the more diffuse art economy of Brazil, abstaining for the most part from participation within its artistic collectives. 3. Schendel's work was never shown in the United States during Hesse's lifetime, although it did receive some international recognition with showings such as that at the Signals Gallery in London in 1965 and the 1968 Venice Biennale. Similarly, it is unlikely that Hesse's work was known in Brazil in the mid-1960s, as she did not start to achieve true international acclaim until the final year of her life, aided by spreads on her work appearing in Artforum and Life magazine in 1970. 4.

The devices of hanging, gravity, and the inertia of entropy are traditionally ascribed to so-called "Post-Minimalism," a term often used to categorize Hesse's art in addition to that of others such as Robert Smithson and Robert Morris. Schendel's Droguinhas , too, could easily have been included in Morris's 1968 "Anti-Form" exhibition for their amorphousness and process-oriented manufacture: however, to refer to Schendel as "a Post-Minimalist before the fact," as Smith does in her review (ibid.), is inherently problematic, as it assumes Schendel to be a stepping stone on the Hegelian path toward an apex of modern Western art. 7.

Cindy Nemser, "A Conversation with Eva Hesse (1970)," in Mignon Nixon, ed., Eva Hesse (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 2002), 17. While many of the works on paper remain untitled, the sculptural reliefs and objects are rarely so. Exceptions include some works made in her final year, most notably the "rope piece." 20. Crow, Rise of the Sixties , 168. 21. Renate Petzinger, "Thoughts on Hesse's Early Work, 1959-65," in Sussman, ed., Eva Hesse , 48. Petzinger sites a possible influence in the 1961 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, "The Art of Assemblage," which included examples of automatic drawing. 22. Mignon Nixon, "'Child' Drawing," in Catherine de Zegher, ed., Eva Hesse Drawing (New York: The Drawing Center, in cooperation with Yale Univ. Press, 2006), 40. 23. Catherine De Zegher, "Drawing as Binding/Bandage/Bondage or Eve Hesse Caught in the Triangle of Process/Content/Materiality," in ibid., 99. 24. Pérez-Oramas, Tangled Alphabets, 27. 25. Rodrigo Naves, in Salzstein, ed., No Vazio do Mundo , 68. This literal impression of the artist's hand on the work has parallels in the occasional handprint left by Jackson Pollock in his allover canvases, or even more so in Jasper Johns' "Skin Drawings" of the early 1960s, in which he left a vera icon of his face and hands in charcoal on a sheet of drawing paper coated in baby oil. 26. Sonia Salzstein, "Mira Schendel: The Immersion of the Body in Thought," in Alma Ruiz et. al, The Experimental Exercise of Freedom: Lygia Clark , Gego, Mathias Goeritz, Hélio Oiticica , and Mira Schendel (Los Angeles: Museum of Contemporary Art, 1999), 215. 27. Rodrigo Naves, "Mira Schendel: The World as Generosity," in Perez- Oramas, Tangled Alphabets , 64. 28. Pérez-Oramas, Tangled Alphabets , 32. Pérez-Oramas points to the fact that the root word for "language" in Latin can also be used to designate "knot." 29. Ibid. 30. Ibid., 34. 31. Guy Brett, "Actively the Void," in Salzstein, ed., No Vazio do Mundo, 57. 32. Penetrable refers to the similar structures of suspended plastic strands made by Venezuelan iknetic artist Jesús Rafael Soto, beginning in the late 1960s, that were meant to be entered and experienced with the entire body. Soto's fabrications, however, are much more vibrant and colorful than Schendel's evanescent Still Waves. 33. Salzstein, ed., No Vazio do Mundo, 207. Salzstein sites Schendel's interest in origins in her recurrent use of the motifs of the circle and spiral; we have also noted this in her loyalty to the primordial letter "A." 34. Ibid., 31-32. 35. Brett, , "Actively the Void," 58. One thinks of Yves Klein's 1958 Le Vide exhibition at the Iris Clert Gallery in Paris in which the audience was invited into nothing other than an empty room. 36. Ibid., 60. 37. Oiticica's confrontation with "the tropical" was not meant to be nationalistic or to buy into folkloric stereotypes of Brazilian culture, but instead was envisioned as a semi-satirical defense mechanism to counteract invading North American cultural trends. Ironically, his term Tropicália has been adopted by the kitschy genre of popular music known as tropicalismo. 38. Briony Fer, "Bordering on Blank: Eva Hesse and Minimalism (1994)," in Nixon, ed.
