Translated by Martyn Clarke. Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1989. xvi, 476 pp. Judged by its cover alone, David Charlton's edi- tion of E. T. A. Hoffmann's musical writings is immediately prepossessing. A detail from the seventeenth-century artist Jacques Callot's The Temptation of Saint Anthony portrays the pi- ously steadfast saint surrounded by fantastical demons of Boschian invention. The name of the artist is familiar from Hoffmann's Fantasie- stiicke in Callots Manier; the style represents a central aspect of Hoffmann's musical and ar- tistic thought. In the prefatory essay to the Fan- tasiestiicke, Hoffmann explains his fascination with Callot: No master has known so well as Callot how to as- semble together in a small space such an abundance of motifs, emerging beside each other, even within each other, yet without confusing the eye, so that individual elements are seen as such, but still blend with the whole . . . his drawings are but reflexes of all the fantastic apparitions called up by the magic 286</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS of his exuberant fantasy.... Even the commonest subjects from everyday life . . appear in the glow of a certain romantic originality, so that one's thoughts are surrendered to fantasy, and engaged in the most amazing way .... Callot's grotesque forms ... reveal to the serious, deeper-seeing observer all the hidden meanings that lie beneath the cloak of absurdity (pp. 76-77).1 Anyone even passingly familiar with Hoff- mann's Beethoven criticism will recognize here the same apotheosis of abundant and engaging variety, overarching unity, hidden meaning, and preternatural fantasy. Hoffmann continu- ally sought these qualities in the art and music of others; together they form the essence of Ro- manticism, which he understood more as a syn- chronic mode of all art than as a historical development peculiar to his own age. These were the same qualities Hoffmann strove to embody in his own work as writer, artist, com- poser, conductor, and critic-for there was no one domain within which this irrepressible scribbler could give complete rein to his imag- ination. Add to these endeavors his vocation as a successful member of the Berlin legal estab- lishment, and the result is a character whose very life seems to have been composed by a Callot. The music, drawings, tales, and essays of E. T. A. Hoffmann form the myriad antic traces of a bifocal and twilight existence teth- ered between the myopic daylight of the Prus- sian judiciary and the sweeping night vision of German Romanticism. As the author of the first chapter of Ro- mantic music criticism and the charter member of the musico-literary coalition which created the mythologization of Beethoven, Hoffmann also exercises an unsurpassed fasci- nation for all those who attend to Western mu- sical culture in the early nineteenth century. German scholars have long held sway in the continuing critical engagement with this as- pect of Hoffmann's work, the perceptive inter- pretations of Carl Dahlhaus and, more recently, Klaus-Dieter Dobat, being but the present face of a rich tradition of exegetical studies.2 With the appearance of the present volume we may well expect a resurgence - for which Charlton's work cannot fail to be the starting point - of English-language scholarship on the subject of Hoffmann the musical thinker. Contained in this volume are translations of Kreisleriana, The Poet and the Composer (from Die Serapionsbriider), and most of Hoffmann's critical reviews.3 In addition, Charlton provides introductory essays to Kreisleriana, The Poet and the Composer, and to the general subject of Hoffmann as a writer on music. As we shall see, these essays reveal Charlton's broad familiarity with the most important and influential strains of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth- century literary production and a no less im- pressive command of the musical life of the time. He also offers a helpful, if not especially comprehensive, bibliography at the end of the volume, referring readers instead to Gerhard Kaiser's E.T.A. Hoffmann (1988) for a more re- cent and complete critical bibliography. I The presence of the translator, Martyn Clarke, is curiously downplayed in the prefa- tory materials to the volume. The only refer- ences to him outside of the title page are found in Charlton's claim that "the translations in this book are the result of collaborative work between the translator and the editor" and in a line in the acknowledgements. I would like to bring him out of the shadows somewhat and walk a piece of his way with him, by looking closely at a representative sample of his work. The following paragraph may serve not only as a demonstration of some of the problems and triumphs of this type of translation but will also initiate a line of thought about Hoffmann's music aesthetics. Taken from Hoffmann's re- view of Beethoven's Mass in C, op. 86, the ex- 'Charlton includes this brief essay in order to provide some idea of the original context of Kreisleriana, which ap- peared as part of the Fantasiestficke in Callots Manier (1814-15). 2Carl Dahlhaus, The Idea of Absolute Music, trans.

Nun, und eben dies ist ja der Eindruck des Rein- Romantischen, wie es in Mozarts, in Haydns phan- tastischen Kompositionen lebt und webt! The magnificent proportions of St Peter's elevate the spirit while preserving a balanced relationship, but it is with a strange inner disquiet that the ob- server stares at the cathedral rising high into the air with its audacious convolutions and extraordinary interplay of fantastic figures and flourishes. This very unease, however, arouses presentiments of un- known wonders, and the spirit willingly surrenders to the dream in which it seems to recognise celestial infinities. Now this is precisely the impression given by the pure romanticism living and moving in Mozart's and Haydn's fantastical compositions! (p. 328).4 Clarke's translation alters the exclamatory nature of Hoffmann's rhapsodic observations by replacing the superlatives "ktihnsten" and "sonderbarsten" with the Latinate adjectives "audacious" and "extraordinary," and by trans- lating the verb "anstaunen" (to gape at with as- tonishment) with "stare." A literal rendering of these superlatives in conjunction with a verb denoting astonishment would sound somewhat overwrought in English: "but with a strange inner disquiet the astonished observer gapes at the cathedral rising into the heavens with the boldest convolutions and the most singular in- terplay of fantastic figures and flourishes." Al- though it is true that German superlatives are more easily swallowed within the flow of a sen- tence than their English equivalents, Hoff- mann's use of them generally goes beyond even ordinary German usage. This accords not only with his own rhetorical disposition but with that of his age. The attenuation of this feature in translation is not a decision to be taken lightly, and it points to one of the many treach- erous passes in an always difficult crossing. This is not to claim that Clarke ignores en- tirely the effect of Hoffmann's superlatives. His word "audacious" certainly has more bite than "bold." But its Latinity bespeaks a certain quality of thoughtfulness, of the chosen word; this effect is approximately the same in German as in English (notice the retarding ef- fect of Hoffmann's term "kommensurabel"). The upshot is that Clarke's translation, while protecting the English reader from a rhetorical enthusiasm that may indeed seem childish, dis- tances itself from the impassioned blatancy of the original. Much of the force of Hoffmann's rhetoric depends on the contrast between the stately, unperturbed language used to describe St. Peter's- "grandiose," "Verhliltnisse," "Ge- milt," "kommensurabel," "bleiben" - and the Gothic proliferation of clauses and superlatives reaching into "das Unendliche." Clarke's rendition of this latter part of the paragraph also deserves comment. His phrase "unknown wonders" is a tidy and not unpoetic way of accounting for those weighty abstract nouns, "das Unbekannte" and "das Wunder- volle," especially since they appear in Hoff- mann's original as embedded objects of the adjectival gerund "ahnend." But when this same strategy merges "das Oberirdische" and "das Unendliche" into "celestial infinities" at the end of the sentence, the entire thought seems to be trivialized just at that point in the passage where Hoffmann's original reaches its final term, its non plus ultra. For what kind of infinity can be pluralized? In the original, the balanced apposition of the four abstract con- cepts stands out in relief: "das Unbekannte" and "das Wundervolle" are revealed as "das iJberirdische" and "das Unendliche." Can we feel the same resolution between "unknown wonders" and "celestial infinities?" No, be- cause such commonplace adjective-noun con- structions are so smoothly worn as to let the reader slide right over them. In contrast, Hoff- 4The German original is taken from E. T. A. Hoffmann.

Each adds, as with an intake of breath, to the general feeling of as- tonishment elicited by the Gothic grandeur of the cathedral. Yet even this interpretation is offered from an English-speaking point of view. The German language traffics incessantly in such nouns; normative literary discourse makes no cere- mony in its use of such conceptual portman- teau words. And it would no doubt be ludicrous to carry such an interpretation over into a trans- lation; there's simply no way that English can bandy about such intractable concepts and maintain the ease of expression exemplified in Hoffmann's prose. Here is a possible solution which preserves the adjectival genesis of these nouns yet does not link them into harmlessly smooth adjective-noun combinations: "yet this very unease arouses a presentiment of things unknown and wondrous, and the spirit surren- ders willingly to the dream in which it seems to apprehend that which is supermundane [celes- tial] and eternal."'5 Some of the words used in the passage above appear repeatedly in Hoffmann's writings about music. Perhaps the most telling is Verschling- ungen, which Clarke translates here as "inter- play." In the essay on Beethoven's instrumental music, the term is rendered as "intricacies."66 Later in the same essay Clarke transforms Hoff- mann's "Wendungen und Verschlingungen" to "twists and turns" (p. 100). Although a compi- lation of these and similar instances would no doubt allow us to construct a multidimensional understanding of the word "Verschlingungen," Clarke's differing, contextual readings hide from the reader the talismanic effect such rich words have for an author like Hoffmann. From this one word alone we can tease out an entire nexus of related concepts: the ornamental con- volutions of the arabesque, rich contrapuntal textures, pleasing confusion, Gothic intricacy, playful intertwining, and music as a life form-as a winding, vinelike continuity (that which "lebt und webt"). Through familiarity with a large amount of the author's writings, the translator must de- cide which words have this kind of importance. S/he is then faced with the dilemma of either repeatedly using the nearest (and undoubtedly inadequate) equivalent, or, as Clarke has done, of picking that facet of the word which seems most relevant to the given context.7 What Clarke gains through his approach is read- ability; this is a professional translation de- signed to make the reader forget about the original. That is to say, the original is not al- ways disturbingly perceptible in the back- ground, like a backstage parent prompting a stammering child - the fate of so many transla- tions which attempt to stay too literal. One can read pages of Clarke's work without remem- bering that it is in fact a translation; this is rare, and commendable. II The Gothic imagery of the passage I have been belaboring emphasizes the role of the fan- tastic and the ornamental. More often than not, Hoffmann makes the same emphasis with im- agery suggesting prodigious vegetation. Con- trapuntal musical textures are subject to met- aphorical interpretation, appearing as strangely proliferating growths and mosses;8 the conti- nuity of Beethoven's instrumental music is lik- ened to the labyrinthine pathways of some fantastical park.9 Such imagery represents something of an aesthetic category in Hoff- sMy solution is, of course, spoiled by the pedantic con- struction "that which," an all-too-mundane piece of syn- tactical business. Yet I select it for now as the lesser of three evils: "things supermundane and eternal" would bee too clankingly repetitious and would trivialize (by plural- izing) the concept of infinity, while using the phrase "the supermundane and the eternal" would simply ape the German and would smell like a translation. 6Clarke matches Hoffmann's phrase "welche wunderbare kontrapunktische Verschlingungen verkniipfen sich hier wieder zum Ganzen!" with "what wonderful contrapuntal intricacies are woven into the overall texture again here!" (pp. 99-100). 'Considered apart from the issue of the treatment of key words, Clarke's method would not be at all objectionable if it weren't for instances such as that mentioned above, where the technical sobriety of a term like "intricacies" robs the original word of its sense of irrepressible life, thus negating the organic element so vital to Hoffmann's notion of musical continuity. 8Hoffmann makes this comparison in a heavily ironic vein in "Thoughts about the Great Value of Music," Kreisle- riana, part I, p. 94. 9In "Beethoven's Instrumental Music," Kreisleriana, part I, p. 100. 289</page><page sequence="5">19TH CENTURY MUSIC mann's musical thought and, it has been ar- gued, forms a central pattern in his work as a whole. 10 Hoffmann glories in the apparent chaos of vi- sual, musical, or literary artworks, a chaos which manifests itself in crowded surfaces teeming with life. And he invests such ingrati- ating chaos with a higher significance than that of mere sensory delectation; this type of art is somehow associated with the "spirit-realm," a magical domain revealed most directly by Ro- mantic music. For Hoffmann, the fantastic convolutions of a Romantic musical work sym- bolize this realm of the unknown, which in turn symbolizes the infinite. This is the pro- gression which he makes explicit in the para- graph cited above. How is such a progression conceivable for Hoffmann? One approach to this problem is suggested by David Charlton's scrupulous annotations. Charlton rarely fails to point out parallels be- tween Hoffmann's writings and other literary and philosophical staples of the age. In the case of the passage quoted above, Charlton first re- fers us to another occasion when Hoffmann used the simile of church architecture, in an essay from the first part of Kreisleriana. In a footnote to that discussion, Charlton draws our attention to the tie between Hoffmann's com- parison and Goethe's similar glorification of Gothic architecture in his early essay "Von Deutscher Baukunst" (1772). Compare Hoff- mann's description of the Strasbourg cathedral with Goethe's prescription for the cathedral builder: Variegate the imposing wall that you are leading to the heavens so that it climbs like a lofty, far- spreading tree of God, a tree which heralds the glory of the Lord its Master throughout the region with a thousand limbs, millions of branches, and leaves as innumerable as the grains of the ocean's sands.1" Hoffmann adopts Goethe's image of a Gothic complexity teeming with life which rises to the heavens and naturally serves as a portal to things eternal, transferring it to music, where the eternal is suggested without the intervening concept of a church as the "tree of God." From Hoffmann's organic convolutions of fantastical figures issues an intimation of unity and of the eternal- without the original stimulus of reli- gious belief. For the duties of faith are no longer paid to the heavenly throne of God but to the wondrous realm of human imagination. Even if Hoffmann's architectural simile was in fact inspired by Goethe, it would be limiting to conclude that this kind of displaced spiritu- ality informs the entire range of Hoffmann's fascination with the Gothic imagery of won- drous chaos and exuberant variety. The idea of a "beau desordre" has been associated with the aesthetic work of Friedrich Schlegel, in partic- ular with his concept of the arabesque.12 Schlegel characterized the arabesque as an "in- dication of endless abundance" (unendliche Fiille). The portrayal of such abundance in a work of art, whether visual or literary, engen- ders a "premonition of heaven.'"'3 If the appear- ance of the arabesque, which Schlegel formulated as both a local technique and a structural principle, was indeed felt to be sug- gestive of the presence of the infinite, then art- ists could use this technique as a way to solve the typically Romantic aesthetic problem of representing the eternal with finite means.14 A music whose surface somehow manifested the vinelike convolutions of the arabesque or whose large-scale organization suggested a highly varied and episodic structure might then be felt to evoke the eternal. Hoffmann argued that musical works of Romantic sensibility, particularly those of 0oErwin Rotermund, "Musikalische und dichterische 'Ar- abeske' bei E. T. A. Hoffmann," Poetica 2 (1968), 48-69.

The associ- ation of a unified art work with intimations of eternity can be linked to the aesthetic specula- tions of Karl Philip Moritz, as is most recently pointed out by Dobat.'5 Moritz's thesis depends simply on the comparison of the unified art- work with the unified cosmos: the most pro- found unity is one which cannot be demon- strated, but can only be apprehended through the same mystical faculty which divines the unity of nature. The activation of this faculty brings with it the intimation of eternity. III Perhaps the single most pervasive metaphor for music in Hoffmann's writings is that of a distant and fantastical realm. Such an idea is central to Hoffmann's first published story, "Ritter Gluck," which appeared in the Allge- meine musikalische Zeitung in 1809. The mad protagonist of this tale describes a dream world within which he communes mystically with the spirit of music. Hoffmann's theme of a uto- pian Mdrchenwelt was to remain pervasive throughout his tales; he often associates this other world explicitly with music. In the late novella Klein Zaches, for example, the realm of the magus Alpanus is a place where music sounds from the very trees. Compare Hoff- mann's description of his experience when lis- tening to Beethoven's trios: like someone wandering along the labyrinthine pathways of some fantastic park, hedged in by all kinds of rare trees, shrubs, and exotic flowers, and becoming more and more deeply absorbed, I am still unable to extricate myself from the extraordinary twists and turns of your trios (p. 100).16 But Hoffmann's distant spirit-realm is not merely one of innocent fascination. On the con- trary, it can inspire fear, and it is often inhabited by demonic forces. A little over a year after the publication of "Ritter Gluck," Hoffmann was to write the following oft-quoted sentences: Beethoven's instrumental music unveils before us the realm of the mighty and immeasurable .... [It] sets in motion the machinery of awe, fear, of terror, of pain, and awakens that infinite yearning which is the essence of romanticism (p. 238).17 In Kreisleriana we read: "There are moments ... at which the numerical proportions of music and the mystical rules of counterpoint arouse in me a profound horror. Music! It is with secret trepidation, even with dread, that I utter your name!" (p. 105). The protagonist in "Ritter Gluck" speaks of the horrors of the dream-world, and Hoffmann's most famous musical creation, the Kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler, was capable of improvising himself into "a dark abyss of inconsolable lamentation" (p. 135).18 The most imminent danger lurking in this other world was madness; throughout Hoffmann's literary oeuvre, the figure of Kreis- ler embodies most potently the confrontation with this danger.19 In his critical introduction to Kreisleriana, Charlton discusses the theme of insanity in Hoffmann's work and cites a fascinating series of articles written by Rochlitz for the Allge- meine musikalische Zeitung in 1804, com- prising a detailed case-study of an insane musician.20 As Charlton points out, Hoff- mann's Kreisler shares many of the same pre- occupations as Rochlitz's madman, "Karl." This connection gains significance when one considers that Johannes Kreisler, perhaps more than any other fictional character of the age, helped to insure the association of artistic ge- nius with madness in the popular imagina- tion.21 Of course, it is difficult to separate the 5sDobat, Musik als romantische Illusion, p. 63. 16In the essay "Beethoven's Instrumental Music." 17From the review of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

"1Hoffmann envisioned writing a series of essays con- cerning Romantic music philosophy, to be presented from the point of view of Kreisler; these were to carry the title "Lucid Intervals of an Insane Musician." It is likely that some of the projected essays coincide with those which eventually found their place in Kreisleriana, pp. 47-48. 20Entitled "A Visit to the Asylum," Rochlitz's case-study was serialized in issues 39 through 42 of the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung. One of the installments contains Rochlitz's transcription of a brief piano fantasy improvised by the patient. 21Balzac, for example, could only have had Kreisler in mind when he noted that the possessed composer of his novella Gambara was a hero "digne d'Hoffmann."

The work that reveals most explicitly the central role of madness in Hoffmann's aesthetic thought is the collection of dialogues and sto- ries published in 1819-21 as Die Serapions- briider. Just as Tieck had done several years earlier in his Phantasus, Hoffmann framed a va- riety of fictional works within the ongoing meetings of a group of aesthetically minded friends. This group takes its name from the fic- tional hermit Serapion, whose outrageous vi- sions are superceded only by his absolute faith in their veracity. Inspired by this striking figure, Hoffmann's brotherhood swears to up- hold what they call the Serapiontic principle: they will only relate those things that they have experienced with the vividness of reality. This type of inner vision is thus posited as the fun- damental source of all artistic production. By making the foundation of his aesthetics a con- dition which is tantamount to psychosis, Hoff- mann sets the stage for the tenacious paradigm of the possessed artist.23 Madness becomes a sine qua non of great art. Preoccupation with madness was a promi- nent characteristic of the Romantic artistic temperament; the central position of this theme in Hoffmann's writings can provide the basis for an investigation of the provenance of such a tendency. Like many artists of his gen- eration, Hoffmann was keenly aware of the often painful relationship of the creative artist to society.24 His frequent characterization of true art as a separate mental realm may well have to do with the insecurity inherent in his own circumstances, for he was living what amounted to a double life: by day he was an ex- emplary professional citizen (at the height of this aspect of his career he worked as a re- spected judge); by night he was a writer and mu- sician. Hoffmann's portrayal of such figures as Ritter Gluck and Johannes Kreisler and the sometimes forced tone of his apotheoses of the true realm of art betray a certain measure of bad faith in the sanity of any creative artist. This bad faith may in turn indicate an underlying in- vestment in the solid values of the bourgeoisie, resulting in a deep-seated distrust of the cre- ative enterprise. Thus the presence of the de- monic in Hoffmann's spirit-realm most likely symbolizes the fears attending his own involve- ment in this realm. Perceived against the back- drop of a basically sane professional world, these demons breed the fear of insanity, a fear which both haunted and fascinated Hoffmann throughout his career. If insanity courts ambivalence in Hoff- mann's world, perfect sanity is nevertheless ut- terly abhorrent. Hoffmann is at his most wickedly satirical when seized with contempt for the ever-present philistine, understood as that comfortable, self-important class of burgher who would presume to display critical judgement in the affairs of art while spurning as mad all those who truly possess such judge- ment. In his untiring crusade against this num- berless foe, whom he once fetchingly described as "dummklug,"25 Hoffmann is quite able to sustain entire essays with a mocking spleen that borders on the brutal. Not even Schumann, who so gleefully took up these very cudgels, could match Hoffmann's ironic endurance, which carries several essays of Kreisleriana and informs the entire structure of his late novel nouncement: "il est au-dessous de sa reputation; il y a quelque chose, mais pas grand chose; il parle bien mu- sique; il n'entend rien a l'amour et a la femme." Cited in Honore de Balzac, Le Chef-d'oeuvre Inconnu, Gambara, Massimilla Doni, ed. Marc Eigeldinger and Max Milner (Garnier-Flammarion, 1981), p. 251. 22As an example, Charlton cites the diary entry of 6 Jan- uary 1811: "Why, sleeping and waking, do I think so often of insanity?" (p. 47). Hoffmann's interest in madness ex- tended to a familiarity with the leading clinical literature of his age on the subject.

It is tempting to associate Hoffmann's manic tirades against philistinism with his fear of insanity: ambivalent insecurity works to structure his world into two antago- nistic factions, neither of which he could join without qualms. The everyday world of the bourgeois philistine faces (and defines) the nighttime existence of the creative artist, a he- roic figure who strives to inhabit a Utopian realm of the imagination which either eludes or destroys him. Incapacitating madness is not, however, the inevitable outcome of trafficking in the spirit- realm for Hoffmann; the composer who is able to control the magical elements of music can attain undisputed mastery. The foremost ex- ample of such control is of course Beethoven, whom Hoffmann characterizes as the master of the realm of instrumental music. Like many of Hoffmann's magus, or fairy-king, characters, Beethoven is endowed with special powers; he becomes a wizard, ruler of a nocturnal realm of the colossal and immeasurable, within which the listener's emotions are reduced to one pri- mally intense feeling: "the pain of infinite yearning" (p. 238).26 The idea of a self- empowered ruler of the realm of artistic cre- ation does not sit comfortably with the Romantic conception of the artist as the passive transmitter of some divine voice. For Dobat, one of the chief problems of Romantic aes- thetics is the ambiguous relationship between a conception of artistic genius as the organ of a higher power and a conception of the artist as a ruling force.27 Hoffmann's work, as perhaps no other's, lives in the shadowy middleground of this distinction. How may the artist become a ruling force? Hoffmann characterizes the power of a creative musician as a controlling "presence of mind" (Besonnenheit), and he locates this quality in the music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Faced with the impassioned extravagance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Hoffmann feels the need to vindicate this music by appealing to the composer's Besonnenheit: It is usual to regard his works merely as products of a genius who ignores form and discrimination of thought and surrenders to his creative fervour and the passing dictates of his imagination. He is never- theless fully the equal of Haydn and Mozart in ra- tional awareness [Besonnenheit], his controlling self detached from the inner realm of sounds and ruling it in absolute authority (p. 238).28 The wizard or magus is he who can keep his mind in the world of magic, he who can main- tain daytime sanity in the dreamy night of fan- tasy, in short, he who can integrate the two realms that Hoffmann so adamantly separates in his own life and work. Hoffmann's hero is an idealized being who becomes a demi-god by virtue of his ability to live in the other realm as if it were reality. Such a figure is perhaps mad, by the standards of the philistine, but supremely unaware of and un- troubled by such an assessment. He knows his own truth, as it were, and is not hampered, as Hoffmann himself clearly is, by the bad faith in that truth which results from an ambivalent in- volvement in everyday bourgeois existence. Be- cause of his own splintered viewpoint about art and reality, Hoffmann cannot represent Beethoven as a human being but only as a su- perhuman, magical genius; he thus sows the ir- revocable seeds of a mythology. And the possibility that Beethoven was in fact mythol- ogized for possessing those most unromantic of traits-presence of mind and conscious artistry-reveals a paradox which may well lurk near the heart of Hoffmann's aesthetic thought and that of his age. IV Unlike his spiritual predecessors Wacken- roder and Tieck, Hoffmann is fully capable of 26From the review of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

The adjective "rational" is a term encumbered with far too many intellectual liens to stay solvent in this particular context. The word Beson- nenheit, however, is occasionally employed in the eigh- teenth century to distinguish human mental activity from that of the animal world; such usage aligns well with the notion of ratio. 293</page><page sequence="9">19TH CENTURY MUSIC addressing the technical aspects of music, and it is primarily this combination of man of let- ters and composer/critic which makes him such an irresistible figure in Romantic music aesthetics. Charlton, perhaps wisely, indulges in very little interpretive commentary re- garding music theoretical issues involved in Hoffmann's criticism. Outside of referring to the New Grove article on J. P. Kirnberger or mentioning the terminological conventions of Heinrich Christoph Koch, he does not engage the work of other specifically musical writers and thinkers as they impinge on Hoffmann's work. Yet the sheer number and range of tech- nical observations found throughout Hoff- mann's musical writings demand a critical assessment which can explore the unique rela- tionship of music theory and Romantic aes- thetics his work embodies. This is, in fact, the area of Hoffmann research that beckons most urgently, for the infiltration of Romantic aes- thetics into the theoretical understanding of music created what is surely one of the most te- nacious and influential paradigms in Western musical thought: the organic conception of mu- sical coherence, most _cogently exemplified by the thematic development of Beethoven's he- roic style. Research on Hoffmann's technical under- standing of music has tended to eschew the issue of thematic development in favor of the parameter of harmony and, to a lesser degree, counterpoint.29 Such an emphasis is not sur- prising, as Hoffmann's critical and literary writ- ings repeatedly attest to a preoccupation with harmony and counterpoint. As early as "Ritter Gluck," Hoffmann ascribes mystical properties to triadic harmony, as did Rochlitz's insane musician Karl. Kreisler's improvisations are generally described as a series of harmonies (as were those of Karl). And Hoffmann the critic cannot resist citing his favorite harmonic pro- gressions in Beethoven's instrumental music, which he does by means of figured bass nota- tion. The passages cited by Hoffmann are often transitional and many contain enharmonic modulations; these he treats as magical, when used at the right time and in the right fashion. This latter qualification is clarified in a review of Spohr's First Symphony, where Hoffmann cautions against rapid modulations and the use of enharmonic digressions in any section other than the second part of a sonata form (p. 277). Not even Beethoven escapes Hoffmann's crit- ical gaze in this regard; a passage containing several rapid modulations in the Kyrie of his Mass in C is cited by Hoffmann with the words: "The reviewer cannot recommend this modu- lation as an example to be copied" (p. 332). Counterpoint is treated as the element of music most directly amenable to metaphorical comparisons with the organic growth of plant life. Hoffmann enjoys pointing out dense poly- phonic textures in the music of Beethoven; he understands such passages as natural out- growths of a unified thematic complex: A simple but fruitful and lyrical theme, susceptible of the most varied contrapuntal treatments, abbre- viations, etc., forms the basis of every movement. All the secondary themes and figures are closely re- lated to the main idea, and everything is interwoven and arranged so as to produce the utmost unity be- tween all the instruments (p. 303).30 Hoffmann's notion of counterpoint is far more general than that which we might understand as "strict counterpoint." In fact, Dahlhaus goes as far as to claim that Hoffmann's concept of po- lyphony is subsumed within his concept of har- mony.31 Whether or not we accept the full ramifications of such a claim, it seems clear that Hoffmann understands counterpoint not so much in some narrower sense of imitative 29Nora Haimberger, for example, has written an entire monograph on Hoffmann's conception of the chord, Vom Musiker zum Dichter: E. T. A. Hoffmanns Akkorvorstel- lung (Bonn, 1976); and Rotermund's work Musikalische und dichterische 'Arabeske' concentrates on the nature of counterpoint. An exception is Peter Schnaus, who at- tempts to address a greater number of musical parameters in his E. T. A Hoffmann als Beethoven-Rezensent der Allgemeinen musikalischen Zeitung (Munich, 1977), esp. pp. 89-102. 30From the review of Beethoven's piano trios. 31Dahlhaus, The Idea of Absolute Music, p. 44. Dahlhaus's supposition is hard to substantiate when one considers the arguably metaphysical aura which enveloped and marked the concept of counterpoint in the age of Beethoven, estab- lishing its importance as a separate aesthetic category in early nineteenth-century musical thought; see Richard Kramer, "Gradus ad Parnassum: Beethoven, Schubert, and the Romance of Counterpoint," this journal 11 (1987), 107-09. 294</page><page sequence="10">REVIEWS polyphony but rather in the sense of texturally dense thematic development and manipula- tion. Counterpoint is a fundamental element of his conception of musical coherence because it facilitates the prolific and unified arrangement of thematic material. This brings us to one of the most intriguing aspects of the interface between music theory and Romantic aesthetics in Hoffmann's criti- cism: the translation of aesthetic unity into specifically musical terms. Addressing this problem most directly in his reviews of Beethoven's instrumental music, Hoffmann claims that it is "the close relationship of the themes to each other which provides the unity that alone is able to sustain one feeling in the listener" (p. 100).32 In his review of the op. 70 piano trios, Hoffmann characterizes Beet- hoven's thematic development with what has since become perhaps the most banal clich6 of Beethoven criticism, yet one which is still the object of demonstration in essay after essay, book after book: "It evinces the master's boundless wealth of invention and his penetra- tion of the harmonic depths, that from a single idea a few bars long so many motives are gen- erated, springing from it like the luxuriant blossom and fruit of a fertile tree" (p. 315, italics mine). Elsewhere Hoffmann explains that this type of coherence relies on explicit and demon- strable thematic similarities. Yet he goes on to claim that there is "often a deeper relationship that is not demonstrable in this way [and that] speaks only from the heart to the heart" (p. 251). As an example of this latter sense of unity, Hoff- mann offers the relationship between the sub- jects of the two fast movements and the scherzo of Beethoven's Fifth. The distinction Hoffmann makes here would seem to imply that the unity felt within a movement is subject to demon- stration whereas thematic coherence between movements is detected by intuition alone. With this in mind, may we not read the work of Ru- dolf R6ti, Hans Keller, and others on motivic analysis and thematic process as a belated foot- note to Hoffmann's Beethoven criticism? For reductive analysis has found ways to make technically explicit aspects of musical coher- ence that were initially the object of intuition only. Whether or not this type of analysis actu- ally answers such intuitions or merely provides a means of recording their presence is of course another matter. Formulations of musical coherence and unity in Hoffmann's reviews of Beethoven's in- strumental music are generally associated with the assertion of an intense psychological in- volvement on the part of the listener. Much of the critical rhetoric of Hoffmann and the sub- sequent generation of German critics describes the music of Beethoven in terms of a deep and almost disturbing engagement. One instance from the review of the Fifth will suffice here: "the whole work will sweep past many like an inspired rhapsody. The heart of every sensitive listener, however, is certain to be deeply stirred and held until the very last chord by one lasting emotion, that of nameless, haunted yearning" (p. 250). This feeling of engagement, of a music that disturbs rather than entertains, combined with the technical notion of thematic develop- ment, led to the almost universal critical con- cept of the anthropomorphic subject, the musical theme that acts as a dramatic protag- onist whose tribulations and triumphs com- prise for the listener a deeply engaging psychological process. The continuing presence of this scenario in analytical and critical thought about music is one measure of our debt to Hoffmann. V Thanks to Charlton's efforts, English- speaking scholars and students now have a con- venient window on the activities of one of the most influential figures in the history of modern musical thought. Charlton's editorial presence permits the reader to assume a relaxed yet purposeful gait, somewhere between the systematic crawl of the scholarly reference work and the serendipitous meandering of a suggestive anthology. The texts are not bur- dened with a suffocating mass of obsessive scholarship; the annotations are generally just enough to stimulate further thought and to point in interesting directions. Although spe- cialists will perhaps wince at the inevitable dis- cussions of the influence of Wackenroder, 32From "Beethoven's Instrumental Music." 295</page><page sequence="11">19TH CENTURY MUSIC Novalis, and Diderot's Neveu, and readers of German will be initially affected by a curious feeling of decompression when reading Hoff- mann in English, there is no doubt that any and every peruser of these pages will carry home some valuable new insight into musical life and thought in the early nineteenth century.33 Perhaps the most important service Charlton performs as critical editor is the cross- referencing of ideas from Hoffmann's musical writings with those which arise in his literary works - particularly in the novellas on musical themes, such as "Don Juan," "Ritter Gluck," "Rat Krespel" and "Die Fermate." These su- premely imaginative works should really be read in conjunction with the musical writings, and Charlton has fashioned an edition of these writings which is readily compatible with Hoffmann's literary output. Students of this edition will know what to read and why. The case of E. T. A. Hoffmann demands a bal- anced assessment of his critical, aesthetic, and literary writings; all of these modes of discourse work together in his musical thought. Hoff- mann's ceuvre also stands as a microcosm of the leading pattern of the entire age, for, as Dahl- haus has argued, the prehistory of Romantic music aesthetics emerged in German novels of the late eighteenth century.34 For Dahlhaus, there is no evidence that such novels merely ex- pressed an existing, if tacit, aesthetic; they in fact created the aesthetic. "In other words: lit- erature about music is no mere reflection of what happens in the musical practice of com- position, interpretation, and reception, but rather belongs, in a certain sense, to the constit- uent forces of music itself."35 As critics, we can no longer afford to consider music as an inde- pendent language, especially in the age of Hoff- mann, when, paradoxically, the idea of music as an independent language first took hold. German literature's glorification of music found a leading figure in E. T. A. Hoffmann, the Romantic poet/composer. Yet he proved to be more a will o' the wisp than a guiding beacon, appearing at times amidst his seething fantasies as a desultory caricature of the Romantic art- ist.36 His life embodied that unlikely alliance peculiar to the German character - the paradox- ical combination of officious Griindlichkeit with the capacity for boundless fantasy and ab- straction. In the fairy tale worlds of his stories, as well as in the musical thought of Johannes Kreisler, childlike wonderment cringes with the fear of insanity, and the artist brushed with the presence of the divine returns to brutalize the stay-at-home philistine. Hoffmann clearly offers enchantment with an edge; the man who to a large degree created the role of the musical genius fashioned a fantastical realm for this brave new figure out of his own sharp loss of a sense of place. 33Some other areas of interest in these writings which I have not discussed include early nineteenth-century per- formance practice, the role of the critic, and the tremen- dously important part played by Hoffmann in the formation of Romantic opera and its critical reception. Charlton's copious annotations to Hoffmann's The Poet and the Composer make it abundantly clear that the writ- ings of Hoffmann can help reconstruct this particular chapter of the history of operatic theater. 34Dahlhaus singles out Karl Philip Moritz's Andreas Hart- knopf and Jean Paul's Hesperus in this regard; see Dahl- haus, The Idea of Absolute Music, p. 63. 35Ibid. 36Hoffmann certainly wasn't Goethe's idea of a healthy artist. The aging poet seconded the gibes in Sir Walter Scott's 1827 assessment of Hoffmann's literary work with the words: "welcher treue, ffir Nationalbildung besorgte Teilnehmer hat nicht mit Trauer gesehen, dass die krankhaften Werke jenes leidenden Mannes lange Jahre in Deutschland wirksam gewesen und solche Verirrungen als bedeutend f6rdernde Neuigkeiten gesunden Ge- miltern eingeimpft worden" (cited in Gabrielle Wittkop- Menardeau, E. T. A. Hoffmann: In Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten [Hamburg, 1966], p. 159).</page></plain_text>
