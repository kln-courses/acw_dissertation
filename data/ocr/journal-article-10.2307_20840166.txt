<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MUSLIM WOMAN AND ATHEISM IN SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA MARINA TOLMACHEVA This study grew out of my earlier attempts to outline a composite sketch of the Muslim woman in the Soviet Union as reflected and documented in Soviet research.1 The need for such an effort became apparent to me when I realized, upon reviewing numerous Soviet publications on Islam within the country, on Islam and the woman, on Soviet women in general, and the women of Soviet Central Asia in particular?that such a portrait cannot be found. In the intervening years, the advent of glasnost, the rising awareness of social inequalities faced by Soviet women, and the promulgation of a new law concerning freedom of religion (1990) changed the nature and quantity of available information. The void, however, has not been filled. In the historical literature on Central Asian development and Soviet feminist policies, the focus has been decidedly on the phenomena preceding and accompanying the establishment of Soviet power in Turkistan, Transcas pia and the Pamirs. The details of communist legislation, the struggle to break down the old socio-economic order, and the first successes of women's liberation are recounted through the period of Khudzhum (Hujum, "onslaught") and the first two Five-Year Plans (1927-1938). The "Woman Question" has been considered resolved for the Muslim areas in the first twenty years since the Bolshevik Revolution.2 The period of World War II and after, is still glossed over in congratulatory tones celebrating the established equality of the sexes and the activist role of the emancipated woman. Such chronological perspective, typical even of the works which appeared since 1970,3 creates a dichotomy in the stereotypical portrait of the Central Asian woman. The reader is presented, on the one hand, with the wretched picture of the oppressed woman of the past and on the other, with optimistic, celebratory sketches of the liberated women of the present. In the first instance, the woman is depicted, generally speak ing, as a victim of Islam; in the latter, equally generally, her atheism is</page><page sequence="2">184 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 implied if not stated outright, the presumption apparently being that the liberation from the oppressive effects of the Muslim social order auto matically entailed the elimination of a religious outlook. Both the stereotypes lack the recognition of the woman's participation in religious life as a believer and/or practitioner. Curiously, a guarded recognition of this role was granted in studies of Islamic societies outside the USSR. While opportunities for Soviet Middle East experts to do field research have been extremely limited, in a 1978 book, L.I. Shaidullina reviewed contemporary legislation in Arab countries and stated attitudes of religious authorities concerning women.4 No similar study exists on the subject of the contemporary Central Asian woman, incom parably more accessible?maybe because, in reference to Shaidullina's sub title, the "Woman Question" was no longer regarded as a question for the USSR. The rise of Soviet feminism during the glasnost era remained a European phenomenon.5 Although specialized groups for Islamic research were created within the USSR Academy of Sciences in the wake of the Iranian Revolution, they turned their attention to Middle Eastern Islam. While one may hope that the disproportionate paucity of contemporary historical description6 may be compensated for by the ethnographic and religious studies, their chronology is not stable enough to enable researchers to separate the observed religious phenomena of the present from those described by the informants from memory. A typical example is Ovezov's description of Goklen Turkmen funeral rites, which combines the reminis cences and present practices to recreate a more comprehensive picture of the procedure.7 The focus on the past is consistent with the Soviet view of present-day Islamic beliefs and practices as survivals of the past having no rightful place in the system of materialist world-view and new social relations. It would also agree with the literature stereotype of the believer as old, uneducated, and predominantly female. In 1968 M. V. Vagabov wrote, "the overwhelm ing majority of believers are illiterate and semi-literate people, especially of the older generations, who were born and lived prior to the establishment of the Soviet regime".8 The survival of pre-Islamic elements in Central Asian Islam is also explained by the continuing practice among "mostly middle-aged and elderly people, above all, women".9 Yet the present-day generation of the middle-aged, and even elderly, men as well as women, must be the heirs of the Khudzhum era, whose mindset dates from the fully Soviet historical period. In regard to Soviet Islam then, it is important to acknowledge, as T. S. Saidbaev was first to do among the ideological critics of Islam in 1978, that unlike the other parts of the USSR, the regions of Islamic settlement show a "younger" coefficient of religiosity.10</page><page sequence="3">MARINA TOLMACHEVA/Muslim Woman and Atheism in Central Asia 185 This paper will discuss the religious outlook of Soviet Central Asian women of the post-Khudzhum generations. A discussion of Soviet analyses of Central Asian Islam and religious beliefs will be correlated with sociolo gical and demographic data from the 1970s and 1980s. For reasons of space I shall not discuss Islamic observances. Soviet theoretical approaches to, and practices of, atheistic propaganda will be briefly reviewed through 1990. The chronological framework is limited to the Soviet period; developments following the publication of the Freedom of Religion Act (October 1,1990) or the dissolution of the Soviet Union are not addressed here. The Soviet Believer A few methodological comments are due on the nature of definitions and statistics used in Soviet sources. When describing belief and the believers, Soviet literature generally distinguishes three categories: (1) "deep belie vers", including "fanatics" (Soviet definition for those who strictly perform the normative requirements of Islam); (2) those with "relatively weak" religious beliefs who turn to religion in times of crises, and (3) those par ticipating in mass rituals without religious faith.11 However, when it comes to statistic measurements, it appears that unless a person participates in Muslim ceremonies, she is not considered a believer: Baialieva writes, for instance, that during the fast of Ramadan (orozo) "the number of believers somewhat increases".12 Furthermore, those who hesitate to commit them selves to the questionnaire categories of "believer" or "unbeliever" and choose "indifferent" may be grouped together with non-believers and atheists, rather than "hesitant" and "believers".13 Since Islam allows lapses of observation, the latent nature of Islamic belief and ritual in the Soviet environment has often misled observers into overestimating the degree of secularism modernization has brought to Central Asia. It has been widely recognized that World War II caused a rise in religious activity and devotion among the believers on the one hand, and new spirit of government cooperation with the religious establishment on the other. Paradoxically, for Central Asia the War years were also a period of increased women's participation not only in the economy, where their labour was needed to replace the absent men. During this time a broadening of women's participation in social and political life occurred just as Islam as a faith was reviving after a prolonged and massive ideological attack. It appears that two separate lines of reinforcement may be traced since then. The first is the "crisis line", or a series of developments such as the War, the Ashkhabad earthquake of 1948 and the Tashkent earthquake of 1966 which cause distress, apprehension, disorientation, and increased supersti tion among large numbers of indigenous populace. The spacing of these disastrous events in time not only helps maintain generational allegiance to</page><page sequence="4">186 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 traditional belief but has been noted by the people themselves as having an element of regularity, subsequently perceived as predistined (another ear thquake was widely expected in 1986). The intermittent localized droughts, although on a lesser scale, play an essentially similar role in bringing together the "steadfast" with the "latent" believers, as well as the believers with the clergy.14 The second line of reinforcement involves several tracks within the general course of national development of Central Asian republics. During World War II, a number of factors combined to make Central Asia distinct from other areas of Muslim settlement in the Soviet Union (such as lack of destruction due to military action, influx of industrial enterprises and academic institutions evacuated from European Russia) while some other processes (national demarcation, alphabet reform, formation of republican Academies of Sciences) completed shortly before or during the War provided a convenient threshhold for consolidation of what was designed to be a socialist national consciousness. That the emergent consciousness looked disturbingly nationalistic, became apparent with the 1950s campaigns against national literary epics such as the Kirghiz Manas. That it was not following the expected secular course was also soon noted, and in 1954 the CPSU Central Committee issued two directives "concerning great shortcoming in scientific-atheistic pro paganda and the measures for its improvement" and "concerning mistakes in conducting scientific propaganda among the population".15 Yet a gene ration later the;recognition of religion as a persistent phenomenon involved specifically in what is called "national development" led to new party direc tives, addressing particularly indigenous populations of Central Asia. In 1981 the Turkmenistan CP Bureau of the Central Committee issued the decree "concerning the intensification of atheistic upbringing of the Repub lic's population", followed up by the decisions of two Central Committee Plenums.16 In 1983 the CPSU Central Committee Plenum addressed the problems of social and economic development especially of rural Central Asia.17 Soviet Research on Central Asian Religion While the state and party lines vis-4-vis Islam have been clearly declared, even though not always consistently followed,18 the position of social scien tists, including anthropologists, has been more complex. To begin with, as Clifford Geertz commented, their own background as nonbelievers gets in the way of their empirical study of religion,19 perhaps even more so in Soviet religious anthropology which often aims to serve atheistic goals. In the literature dealing with surviving forms of religion in the USSR, the empirical</page><page sequence="5">MARINA TOLMACHEVA/Muslim Woman and Atheism in Central Asia 187 relevance of beliefs to the believer is reluctantly conceded, but the reluctance itself gets in the way of analysis. The desire to deal with the display of religious consciousness as an exception, aberration, rare and isolated in stance, in principle limits broad conclusions and general observations on Islam as a current contributive part of Soviet consciousness. The most valuable data collected on a sociologically relevant scale come from the relatively recent works by sociologists and social an thropologists who have accepted the "religiosity" of their subjects and made it their purpose to establish the nature and significance of beliefs and obser vances of the contemporary believer who, as they correctly note, is primarily a Soviet worker.20 Furthermore, the majority of Soviet researchers seemed interested in historical origins of religion and the syncretic forms of Central Asian Islam. To them, the devotion of Soviet Muslims often appeared overesti mated because of the non-Muslim (mostly animistic or Zoroastrian) roots of the many current beliefs and practices. While the distinction is important academically and may be of significance to anti-religious propaganda efforts, this paper overlooks it to the extent that Central Asians themselves perceive these elements as belonging within their broad understanding of Islamic, or even national culture and identity.21 The intricate symbiosis of Islamic and pre-Islamic aspects specific to Central Asia22 has caused anthropologists to speak of "Central Asian religion".23 The analysis below, however, will focus on only the few major categories defining the Muslim as such: in orthodox Islam these involve six requirements of belief, the Five Pillars and the rites of passage. Conveniently, these are often the ones highlighted in sociological literature. The population involved in surveys is almost universally Sunnite; where Shi'tes may be present, narrative sources occasionally provide separate data but the statistics available to date do not. Uniformity of sect affiliation, however, may be generally assumed for reasons of homogeneous settlement. Next to local Central Asian characteristics, the kinds of beliefs and practices held by women represent another extensive complex within Central Asian Islam. The prevalence of beliefs in female spirits (fertility, ancestor, and hearth spirits) and female saints (Ambar-ona, Bibi-Seshambe, etc.24), in combination with women's recourse to amulets, pilgrimages to holy places, women's vigils and so on, quite aside from the Islam-prescribed sexual segre gation and women-focused social norm, has created the perception of "women's religion" in Central Asia. Regretfully, although the thesis was first introduced by G. P. Snesarev in 1969,25 the observation has not resulted in further exploration of the specifically feminine characteristics of the com plex. Our summary below is designed to call attention to the gap26 while drawing primarily on empirical studies from different Central Asian loca tions.</page><page sequence="6">188 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 There are a number of problems with these data as well, however. First of all, there are no studies specifically addressing themselves to the consciousness of the Muslim woman. At best, we have an approximation of the sociological profile of a woman-believer; most works?sociological and anthropological?deal with believers in general, and the majority of data refer to men and women together, or men rather than women. Secondly, most data (with the exception of questionnaires administered in one Turkmenistan study directly to large numbers of women-workers) seem to have been supplied by men and to men-researchers, thus they often are second-hand and to that extent reflective of the outward, observable part of women's religious life; they also may be subject to cultural bias, as many of the researchers are either non-indigenous, or of Westernized indigenous intelligentsia. And thirdly, the above definition of the Soviet Muslim as a Soviet worker omits the Muslim who is not part of the state economy. This, for the purposes of our study, may include the Muslim who is retired (urban or rural), the Muslim who is employed nominally or seasonally (e.g., the rural housewife who is a member of the collective farm), the Muslim who has abandoned state employment (e.g., a housewife after her children were born), or the Muslim who has never been employed (such as some older women or young children and students). As we shall see, this group acquires special significance in maintaining the traditional outlook while remaining generally outside both the employment and the propaganda spheres. In Soviet context, it is often the persons of this type (i.e., older, uninvolved in "socialist construction", less educated and usually female) who provided a third stereotype?that of a Soviet believer. Let us now turn to the specific features of this portrait and see to what extent the general izations are born out by the available data from the post-World War II era. Soviet Islam and Women The phenomenon which appears paradoxical to many Soviet sociologists is the allegiance of markedly higher percentages of women, than men, to Islam in the face of generally discriminatory, anti-feminist spirit of Islamic law and the conservative social custom it supports. While the average numbers for recent decades suggest that 70-85% of Soviet believers were women, the rate was expected to be considerably higher for Islamic areas.27 The view may be justified in part by what was said above about the specifically female devotions, but it goes too far in reducing the area of religious exercise to women's domain, practically excluding their husbands, fathers, or sons, i.e., the leading public and family authority figures in the Muslim paradigm. By contrast, the authoritative study by Saidbaev quotes examples to the contrary, citing figures on religiously-inclined cohorts either equal to or larger than non-religious groups,28 and implying the approximate rate of</page><page sequence="7">MARINA TOLMACHEVA/Muslim Woman and Atheism in Central Asia 189 male participation of 20% or higher. Descriptions of various Muslim cere monies frequently emphasize the leadership of older men from the commun ity29 (the official clergy are, of course, always male). While there is no intent here to argue against the high estimates of female religiosity, the factor of latency mentioned above must not be overlooked for the men who, while in their active careers, may suspend or even deny their practice of Islam. The same, of course, may be true of women who answer questionnaires, especially as their level of secular socialization and conditioning to the state political system increases, as among those with more advanced skills or education. No attempt, however, is made below to introduce correctives for such distortions. On the other hand, besides the lingering influences of tradition, the destruction or severe curtailment of coercive aspects of the regulatory func tion of Islam in the Soviet Union not only resulted in pushing Islam into a "back corner" of interpersonal relations and individual spirituality. It also, by removing the worst abuses of women, made the religion of Islam into a mostly comforting, socially accommodating and culturally appealing alter native to what, as was being recognized in the USSR in the 1980s, was generally perceived by the indigenous populace as not merely secular, remote and irrelevant but as "Russian" and "Christian" culture. In other words, Soviet Islam presented its better side to the women of Soviet generations. Besides the well-known effects of economic and legal emancipation, certain emotional aspects of the change may be working to dispose women towards this recently benevolent posture. One example is the new positive attitude in the family to the birth of girls, although the desire for the couple to have a son (or sons) remains intact.31 At the other end of the age spectrum, the pro-natal policies of the Soviet state and the Russian cult of motherhood have come together with the traditional respect for the aged and the orthodox Muslim directive (Hadith) to venerate mothers to promote an aura of Islam as long-standing defender of women's interests.32 In the 1960s the comparatively low rate of indigenous women's par ticipation in state economy was explained by the traditional attitudes de manding female seclusion and women's concentration on domestic duties.33 The proportion of believers among those removed from the sphere of socialized production rises dramatically. One study conducted in the Kara Kalpak ASSR rated the level of belief among those employed outside the home versus the homemakers and the retirees at 1:4:7.34 In the 1970s, even among those employed, the proportion of believers in skilled occupations was found to be six times lower than among those in unskilled jobs (20% and 3.2%). At the same time, both sociologists and labour economists have noticed that the lower-skilled occupations tend to be more heavily filled by</page><page sequence="8">190 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 indigenous employees (at the rate of 4:3). A particularly difficult task for the state economy watchers seemed to be involving married women of child bearing age in industrial employment. Recent explanations of the socio cultural and economic factors reinforcing the use of non-indigenous popula tion in industrial occupations36 bode little change for the near future despite government exhortations. As planners in Bangladesh have learned, women seem to overcome family and public opinion to the contrary in order to engage in work for pay much more easily before marriage or after widowhood that after the wedding and especially after the birth of the first child.37 Cases were known in the Soviet Union where seculsion was enforced by husbands who held important party or managerial posts or those involved in commerce or distribution network, i.e., with access to funds or resources beyond their (usually modest) salary range. On occasion the latter pattern of behaviour was also found to be true of polygamists. Infrequently, women who stayed home after marriage had been political activists or even party members.38 In surveys of believers carried out outside the Muslim areas, those questioned were all employed; the percentage of believers (or those admitting to religious belief) grew with the diminishing "level of social activity". However, the same figures may also be interpreted on the basis of educational and residential background. For the Muslim areas, the figures concentrate on urban employed populations where the total rate of female employment approaches 48%. The women questioned were mostly less than forty and worked in ethnically homogene ous groups with a very low rate of male employment. Interestingly, these women did not connect their choice of employ ment or uninvolvement in state economy with religion. The factors they seem to consider primary are economic, reflective of their self-reliance, pragmatism, and concern over the family well-being. An Ashkhabad worker stated: ki have six children, and if I don't work Allah will not feed them." Additional reward came in the form of respect the woman received from the others (while this was an important part of Soviet social atmosphere, sociologists still do not distinguish between the respect tied to a person's worth as a worker in the larger collective and that guaged by a person's earning power). It has to be acknowledged that the factor of employment held primarily economic significance also in case where, as in one of the factories surveyed in Turkmenistan, the work was done individually in the home and out of touch with the peers. Frequently, women classified as homemakers, far from remaining "mere" housewives, work at home, growing produce on private vegetable plots or engaging in piecework for craft factories or private customers. The crucial question then became that of control over the money</page><page sequence="9">MARINA TOLMACHEVA/Muslim Woman and Atheism in Central Asia 191 the woman earned. According to Islamic law, money earned by the wife belongs to her; Soviet researchers have not addressed the issue of control over family finances nor the cultural conditioning behind it. Several descrip tions of extended Central Asian households indicated that the husband's mother serves as the family treasurer.39 Women who, with growing fre quency, were formally acknowledged as heads of family40 were probably all employed. Unfortunately, there is no breakdown of available figures as to the proportion of indigenous women so recognized, nor whether these are married, widowed or divorced. Age and Religion The age of Central Asian believers is commonly held to correlate directly to the increase in religious participation. While older people in general are taken to be either more superstitious or more concerned with matters spiritual, several additional considerations have to be factored in for the former Soviet Central Asia. First of all, it has been acknowledged generally that, in consideration of the atheistic pressures from the state, many who did not wish to compromise their public image with the secular authorities, revert to freer practice of the ritual upon retirement. The men's retirement age in the USSR was sixty, the women's, fifty-five. Secondly, men celebrate their sixty-third anniversary with a feast designed to commemorate the age of the Prophet Muhammad at death. No comparable date is marked by women. Thus, the life-cycles of men and women follow a somewhat different chronology.41 Thirdly, the formal instruction in Islam traditionally begins at seven years of age (sometimes at six). In the Soviet educational system the child at seven enters first grade and secular instruction begins, accom panied by atheistic inculcation. Before then, of course, she has been in structed by her mother in the norms of traditional behaviour and good manners, heavily permeated by Islamic regulations.42 A sample study of 750 Turkmenian women employees is used below to analyse the correlation of age and education with the rate of Islamic belief, allegiance and sophistication.43 Among these women, those less than forty and those more than forty showed a continuously growing degree of religiosity. The figure forty has a special significance for many Muslims, being associated with the age of the Prophet Muhammad at revelation. The number forty also has a lucky connotation, reinforced in numerous beliefs, proverbs, and folk observances. In Central Asia, lack of religious observation by a person under forty is readily excused by the believers who thus get an easy way to suit secularist conformity. It is particularly striking in this respect that not one women of those questioned in the forty-and-older group claimed to be atheist (the number of non-believers was also significantly reduced). Among the younger-than-forty group a relatively stable percentage showed</page><page sequence="10">192 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 up in the "indifferent" section (average 20%), causing the survey-takers a particular concern as to the origins of such an attitude, i.e., whether these were the original believers grown indifferent to religion, or the original atheists who lost the firmness of their beliefs. Education and Religion. In agreement with other Soviet studies, the women surveyed showed a correlation between the level of education and strength of religious feeling. Those with higher and junior-college education provided the bulk of atheists and non-believers (up to 100%); those with elementary education or less, the bulk of believers. I paid particular attention to the breakdown between seventh grade education and high-school education, because it has been noted that the onset of middle or especially high school period (coinciding with puberty and the former marriageable age) is the moment when many girls are withdrawn from the secularized education network into the home. And indeed, the diminution of the percentage of acknowledged atheists at this stage is equally as striking as that for women over forty. Indeed, it may even be more significant, since it occurs at a formative period of a girl's life and does not conform to the stereotype of the older believer. The disparity between those who consider themselves believers in these two groups was also dramatic (a drop of 9-11%), while those "uncertain" in one instance increased by 32% (while nonbelievers lost over 27%) as their educational level gauged lower. Belief Most believers reported to have no visual image of Allah (over 55%), 12% doubted his existence, about 5% inclined towards an anthropomorphic image. The idea of God is an item of faith (and a requirement in Islam) and thus not analysed by many; while some women have never considered what their God is like, the others were reluctant to discuss him. Presumably, an open discussion was also hampered by the realization that the question naire was originated by non-believers. In this connection, it may be appro priate to note that some of the questions were not answered by all the respondents. The believers differed in their attitude to the immortality of the soul: 18-32% in different enterprises believed in it, 40-58% did not; interest ingly, the question whether the women believed in the existence of the soul was either not administered or not reflected in published research. Approx imately the same percentages denied the existence of paradise and hell (42-70%) while significant numbers (26-50%) believed in their existence but had no image of either. Remarkably few believers thought of paradise</page><page sequence="11">MARINA TOLMACHEVA/Muslim Woman and Atheism in Central Asia 193 as a place of spiritual reward (1.3-2.9%); almost twice as many regarded it as a place of material gratification (1.2-5.1%)?still a very low figure, considering the sensual nature of the picture of paradise painted by the Qur'an. One wonders whether this vagueness on the part of women was related to the lack of a clear and positive promise of paradise specifically to women in Islam. I have encountered no comparable data collected among male believers to do more than speculate here. Another reason for vagueness, of course, may have been the low level of religious instruction (generally, but even more so among women). This last consideration may be indirectly borne out by the observation that many women (16-23%) were unable to respond to questions of cosmological nature (e.g., about the creation). When questioned about the familiar natural phenomena, the women were much less hesitant and mostly favoured natural causes rather than God's will (74-83% vs. 11-20%). At the same time, 14-41% women believed in magic power of the talismans, 23-39% believed in fate, 13-27% in super natural powers of the ishans and fortunetellers. A comparison with data from a Turkmen collective farm shows that 40% among women of sixty or older declared their belief in the existence of the soul while 50% of the respondents in this age category did not have a clear idea; for women in the forty-sixty age bracket the figures were 45% and 33%, respectively, and finally for those forty and younger, the proportion held at justy under 20% in both groups. (The corresponding members for men were 50% and 35%; 20% and 27%; 33% and 4%, respectively.) The data on the level of women believers' education in other parts of the former Soviet Union for the same decades support the common view on direct correlation of education and personal secularism. However, almost more important evidence of Islam's tenacity has been the recognition by the authorities of the failure of the Soviet school system, despite the legislation requiring high school education for all citizens, to sustain progress in areas of Islamic concentration. If the older illiterate or semi-literate women are stereotypical of the past, in the 1980s there was a growing concern about new generations of young women dropping out of educational process, espe cially at high-school and higher-education levels. In the 1970s and 1980s a determined effort was made to enrol students of indigenous nationalities in colleges and universities, even at the expense of the equally or more qualified European applicants.44 During that period, native women gained consider ably in Kazakhstan and Kirghizia as a whole, and in urban Uzbekistan. It appears that traditional conservatism was particularly effective in preventing advanced education for women in Tajikistan, Turkmenia, and rural Uzbekis tan (in that order).45 Available statistics usually confuse the picture by including indigenous</page><page sequence="12">194 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 and non-indigenous women without distinction. The drive from above in the 1970s and 1980s to promote native women's recruitment into the Com munist Party may be a relevant correlate to the similar push for women's higher or specialized secondary education. Thus, in Turkmenistan, while the total women's party membership grew from 18.4% to 24.6% in 1971-81 and from 24.67 to 27.1% in 1981 and 1984, the proportion of Turkmen women in relation to women of other nationalities increased in the same periods from 37.4% to 50.3% to 54.9% .46 One of the main factors preventing young women from pursuing further education was the will of the family concerned with preparing the daughter for a traditional marriage?very simi lar to traditional Middle Eastern Islamic social attitudes. Another obstacle was the distance from home college education often involves. Judging from the press of the perestroika period, although in recent times daughters might be allowed to travel from country to town to attend college, they were still being prevented from venturing beyond the republic's boundaries. Hie level of religious instruction among women was extremely low. the official religious schools admit men only, and among the religious estab lishment the main effort to instruct women was limited to the immediate family. Such women (wives, sisters, and more rarely daughters) were then used as emissaries for work among the wider public. However, their impact was very limited on the religious level; it was considerably stronger in the matter of organizing festival preparations, mobilizing public opinion, collect ing funds, etc. On a positive note, the attitude of the religious establishment towards women's education changed by the 1970s from total opposition to encourage ment. Special care, again, was taken to have the women of Muslim establish ment families well educated in Soviet institutions. Conversely, some under ground Muslim groups, such as Ahl-i Qur'an in Tashkent, while enforcing strict fundamentalist Islam and the study of the Qur'an among its members, demanded withdrawal of the girl students from school after 7-8 grades.47 Religious Activism A related development, which may not be perceived as universally positive but was certainly non-conformist, also resulted from the specifically Soviet context: progressive secularization and the state pressure against the Islamic norm created opportunities for women's religious activism. Educated and (relatively) mobile Muslim women were found in Russia before the Revolution of 1917. They were mostly Tatar and they had played an important role in Central Asia in promoting Islamic education and social freedom for local women. However, it was only after the Soviet law broke</page><page sequence="13">MARINA TOLMACHEVA/Muslim Woman and Atheism in Central Asia 195 the Sharfah and 'ddat restrictions, created defences for the newly-liberated but poorly protected woman, and finally tied the liberation of the women to material gain for the family, that Muslim women acquired a viable new position in society. Admittedly, all this was done with a secularizing goal in mind, but the resulting liberating also opened doors for women towards a meaningful participation in religious life, from which they were previously restricted by misogynistic tradition. Consequently, especially during and after World War II and also more recently, unauthorized mullahs, ishans and Muslim shamans have ap peared48?women who were sometimes related to religious establishment figures (for the most part, though, they were not recognized by the clergy). Playing a role of leadership, they exercised the new opportunities granted them by the socialist, atheist state in areas where, somewhat in conformity with the past tradition, the establishment?being male?was often out of contact with women at large. (Even while the establishment clergy invited women to attend mosque and hear the Friday sermon 49 the male attitude forces them to stay at home or pray?on special occasions only?in the streets adjoining the mosque.)50 The public of these women-preachers also benefitted from a raised level of social consciousness, which for some included a desire to exercise their right to participate in their own religion or at least make a meaningful contribution to traditional observances. That tradition continued to be a determinant in this respect, may be evidenced by the fact that while public lectures on religion were generally well-attended, according to repoerts criticizing the level of atheist work almost no women of native nationalities ever showed up. Modernization and public acceptance together have greatly increased the mobility of these women?both the preachers (who began to travel widely) and their female public (who attended religious meetings and celebrations, and performed pilgrimages51 on their own while in the past they would not have been able to leave their homes). Failure of Atheist Propaganda Repetition of atheist slogans in pre-Party Congress campaigns, and period ically renewed exhortations (which continued through the 1980s) to resolve the questions of "ideological education" and eliminate the "relics of feudal bey-type attitudes" are evidence that state authorities and party ideologues were aware of their falling short of desired results to instill secular conscious ness. No special Soviet studies have dealt with Islam-state relations in post-WWII Central Asia.52 Sociologists and informed critics of religion have lately shied away from the kind of propaganda interpretations of Islam formerly typical of the official antagonistic position. During the period of</page><page sequence="14">196 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 glasnost in an uneasy transition from historically- or ethnographically-focused studies to analyses of contemporary religion, researchers have avoided dis cussing Islamic beliefs, especially if this involved the use of Soviet material. In contrast to Christianity, the discussion of the Islamic religion and of the Qur'an was skirted.53 In the 1980s, it had begun to be recognized in the scholarly Soviet literature that among the professional propagandists of atheism many do not know much about Islam. I have already mentioned that few indigenous listeners, especially women, voluntarily exposed themselves to atheist (espe cially anti-Islamic) propaganda. But even if they were to do so, few such propagandists were of indigenous nationalities, and few atheist instruction publications were made available in the indigenous languages. Besides this limitation on the possibilities of communication with the local population, women were even harder to reach because studies have shown that command of Russian (the dominant language of atheist instruction) was particularly low among indigenous women. Moreover, even educated non-Muslims often do not realize that Mus lim practices and observances are inseparable in Islam. The learned experts have failed to communicate to the public that separation of "church and state" is impossible in Islam, that ritual is part of the law, and that abandoning practice and even dissimulating may be permissible for a Muslim who stops short of open apostasy. Ethnographers still speak of beliefs held by Central Asian Muslims as "superstitions", as if that made them less part of religion. The emphasis on historical approaches to living religion, with academic focus on "survivals" within Islam of pre-Islamic beliefs and practices has only led to vagueness and incomplete understanding of what is Islam. Finally, the state priorities directed the interpretation of data on women's consciousness towards exploring their lack of political participation rather than spiritual, emotional, or social needs.54 The glasnost phenomenon affected mostly the print media, and mostly in the central or European republican press. Its priorities focused on political targets and needs; religion, on the contrary, instead of becoming a target became a beneficiary. The government worked for an alliance with the church, the citizens revealed an old, or developed a new, interest in religion and faith, and the press gave vent to public inquiries and concerns about the role of religion in Soviet society. Some startling data were offered: for example, in 1991 one survey placed the women of Kazakhstan, Turkmenia and Estonia among the least, while rating the rural Ukrainian women as the most religious.55 While Christianity was highlighted the most in the press, on television, and in supposedly secular ceremonies such as the inau guration of the Slavonic year (May 1991), Islam became the subject of</page><page sequence="15">MARINA TOLMACHEVA/Muslim Woman and Atheism in Central Asia 197 information-filled newspaper items, generally offered without criticism56 or, in such still sensitive areas as Islamic marriage, with a self-conscious willing ness to discuss and understand.57 In politically charged cases, such as attacks on the Meskhet Turks in Ferghana (Uzbekistan), the press seemed willing to accept the statements of both the so-called "informals" (usually liberal, nationalist non-party activists) and the orthodox Muslim authorities that "the conflict. . . had nothing to do with Islam".58 It has often been implied that atheism was never embraced by the indigenous Central Asian people. This makes the numerous brochures and books designed for atheist propaganda sound false especially when authored by the locals. As recently as 1987 the book by Iarkuli Khadzhiev, Utverzhdaia ateisticheskoe miroponimanie (Asserting the Atheist World-View) offered 195 pieces of advice designed to assist in "revealing the reactionary essence of Islam".59 The change in the climate of public opinion is demonstrated by the remarkably speedy rebuttal by N. Bairamsakhatov who published a series of newspaper articles titled "Perestroika: religion and atheism".60 In a detailed chronicle of what has gone wrong with communication between the state and indigenous societies, Bairamsakhatov put the blame for many Turkmen grievances against communist authorities in pursuit of atheism. During 1988-89 Central Asian republican newspapers, rather than academic press, debated such issues as incompatibility of orthodox Islam with nationalism, modernization trends in "traditional-relgious activities", the disinterested attitude of the Komsomol towards compliance with Islamic law conflicting with Soviet legislation, inertia of atheist propaganda, and resurgence of Islamic rituals. Titles like "To Assert an Atheistic World View" or "Greater Aggressiveness for Atheism"61 are indicative both of the concern over new information about the hardships faced by the indigen ous women in Central Asian republics, and of the realization that the climate, if not yet accomplishments, of glasnost made those charged with instilling atheism face enormous problems. In 1990 the local press was beginning to complain that glasnost had not reached the republics62 and that ideological efforts needed an infusion of "openness and realism".63 The celebration of the Persian solar New Year nowruz (nauryz), sanctioned as a "secular" festival since 1976, was declared a republican holiday in Uzbekistan and held in 1990 at the tomb of the local Sufi saint Khoja Ahmad Yasavi: the newspaper printed a photo but withheld comment on the religious connection.64 The debate whether the tomb should be turned into a museum65 was quickly overshadowed by rapidly progressing discussions of the national (republican) language, bilinguialism, and the news of the foundation of Islamic Institutes (named after al-Bukhari in Tashkent and al-Farabl in Alma-Ata) and the publication of the Qur'an in</page><page sequence="16">198 Islamic Studies 33 (1994) 2-3 Central Asian languages. The impression of retreat, hesitancy, fumbling, and lack of both infor mation and determination on the part of ideologues of atheism is inescapable. The Russian-language Teacher's Gazette with Union-wide circulation offered some paradoxical instances of reporting educational developments Soviet teachers had been called upon for decades to oppose, such as the teaching of Christian ethics in Moscow city schools or a priest's participation in the teachers' "pedagogical council".66 An attitude of appeasement, which for merly would have been roundly denounced as primirenchestvo (ac comodationism), may be gleaned from statements like this one by N. Medzvedskaia: "Honesty was taught by religion. . . .The same was preached by the Muslim mullahs:967 The example of the Teacher's Gazette makes it clear that atheism did not fall iii battle: it surrendered. Within a few short months after the promulgation of the Law on the Freedom of Conscience, the tenor of this publication, traditionally charged with inculcation of correct ideological at titudes among both teachers and students, changed from feebly echoing earlier concerns ("Religion is Ideology") to almost friendly, if inanely, inquir ing "How are your studies, Muslims?"68 and reporting on ecumenical priests' roundtable sessions in Osh, Frunze and Tashkent.69 1M.
