<plain_text><page sequence="1">Research Note Clarification of the Link Between Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Religiousness: The Role of Religious Maturity GARY K. LEAK* BRANDY A. RANDALL* Previous research has consistently found that religious individuals tend to be authoritarians and au- thoritarians tend to be religious. However, in those studies religiousness has been defined and measured within a limited framework which has emphasized orthodoxy and conventionality. Consistent with theoriz- ing in the psychology of religion, we hypothesized a negative association between authoritarianism and re- ligious maturity. As expected, authoritarianism was positively related to several different facets of less ma- ture faith development, and negatively related to several aspects of relatively mature faith development. Our results, which are congruent with the theorizing of Allport and Fowler, suggest that the connection be- tween authoritarianism and religiosity depends strongly on the nature of the religious variables studied. This research should serve to qualify statements about a simple link between religion and authoritarian- ism. For decades, research has attempted to explicate precisely the relationship between reli- gion and an interrelated variety of negative social attitudes, such as intolerance, prejudice, authoritarianism, and dogmatism. When religion is conceptualized in unitary terms, such as church attendance or affiliation, religion often goes hand in hand with these negative social attitudes (Wulff 1991, chap. 5). One of the most interesting social-psychological traits that have been linked to reli- giosity is authoritarianism. However, traditional measures of authoritarianism, such as the F-scale, have been plagued by serious measurement problems. To overcome these inadequa- cies, Altemeyer (1981) carefully developed the balanced Right-wing Authoritarianism (RWA) scale, which measures the authoritarian syndrome of conventionality, submission to author- ity, and authoritarian aggression. Recent work (e.g., Altemeyer 1988; Billings and Gaustello 1993) has demonstrated that the RWA scale has excellent reliability and impressive construct validity. For example, individuals who score high on the RWA scale are prone to aggress against unpopular or un- conventional groups (Altemeyer 1988:114-120), feel morally superior and self-righteous (157- 161), possess a mean-spiritedness that is coupled with vindictiveness and a "secret pleasure" when others experience misfortune (154-157, 203), and appear prejudiced toward out-groups (187-188). Especially striking is the indiscriminativeness of authoritarians in their discrimi- * Gary K. Leak is an associate professor of psychology at Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178. * Brandy A.

Altemeyer interprets such results as reflections of the conventionality, submission to author- ities, and hostility toward out-groups that are at the core of right-wing authoritarianism. With a consistency that approaches lawfulness, Altemeyer (1988) has found that au- thoritarianism is positively correlated with several aspects of personal religiousness. For ex- ample, authoritarians generally possess orthodox Christian beliefs, adhere to their childhood religion, are intrinsically religious, and actively practice their faith (e.g., frequent church at- tendance and prayer). The authoritarian's religiousness also contains strong elements of fundamentalism and an unwillingness to doubt his or her beliefs (Altemeyer 1988; Alte- meyer and Hunsberger 1992). Altemeyer (1988:230-231) summarizes the connection be- tween authoritarianism and religion by stating: Authoritarians in my samples tend to be religious persons and vice versa. High RWAs usually have tightly wound religious ideologies. They appear to be under appreciable pressure to believe truly, and they keep doubts to themselves, split off and tucked away.... Their belief system appears self-confirming, enduring, and closed. Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1992:113) began their recent article with the deceptively simple question "Are religious persons usually good persons?" Based on what has been pre- sented to date, the answer is likely to be discouraging. The religion of authoritarians ap- pears orthodox and even fundamentalist, rigid and compartmentalized, habitual and obedi- ent. However, this conventional, unexamined, and outer-directed religious orientation is anathema to long-standing notions in the psychology of religion about the nature of mature religiousness. For example, Allport's (1950) classic theorizing emphasized the dual role of a sincere, devout religious commitment coexisting with a willingness to question one's current beliefs in the fashioning of a personal and mature religious sentiment. Fowler's (1981) influ- ential theorizing has emphasized the importance of questioning along with a reflected inner- directedness in the process of faith development. Batson, Schoenrade, and Ventis (1993:367) ask "Is religion on our side?" These au- thors claim that the answer depends on how one measures religiousness. It is our contention that the picture of religion and authoritarianism as unhealthy collaborators is the product of the limited range of operations previously used to assess religiosity. Our premise was that a mature approach to religion is antithetical to authoritarianism, given its emphasis on exces- sive conventionality, submission to authority, and the willingness to aggress against unpop- ular or "sinful" groups. Thus we predicted that right-wing authoritarianism would be posi- tively correlated with an orthodox and conventional orientation to religion, but negatively correlated with several measures of a relatively mature religiousness (i.e., the 'good Chris- tian" sought by Altemeyer and Hunsberger). METHOD Subjects and Procedure The participants were 107 female and 49 male students (Mage = 19.1, SD = 2.4, range = 17 to 40) recruited from upper- and lower-division psychology classes, who were offered ex- tra credit for their help. Subjects anonymously completed a packet of materials in groups of approximately 20 students each.</page><page sequence="3">CLARIFICATION OF THE LINK BETWEEN RIGHT-WING AUTHORITARIANISM AND RELIGIOUSNESS 247 Materials and Predictions Right-wing authoritarianism. Authoritarianism was measured with Altemeyer's 30-item RWA scale (1988 version), modified from a 9- to a 5-point response format, and an- chored by the end points "strongly disagree" and "strongly agree." Alpha reliability estimates tend to range from .85 to .90 (.87 in this research). Extensive documentation of the scale's construct validity can be found in Altemeyer (1981, 1988) and a summary in Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1992). Measures of Conventional Religiousness. Christian orthodoxy: Belief orthodoxy was measured by Hunsberger's (1989) 6-item version of the Christian Orthodoxy (CO) scale. Consistent with earlier work (Altemeyer and Hunsberger 1992), it was predicted that RWA would correlate positively with this measure of religious orthodoxy. Self-reported religious practices and convictions: Subjects were asked "How deeply re- ligious are you in a traditional way (e.g., the importance of being a member of an organized religion ... etc.)?" and "How deeply religious are you in a spiritual sense (e.g., the impor- tance of worshipping alone . . . etc.)?" Subjects responded on a 5-point scale from "not at all religious" to "very religious." Participants were also asked how interested they were in reli- gion on a 5-point scale from "not at all interested" to "very interested." Subjects also re- sponded to a question that assessed their level of orthodoxy - specifically, what percent of their church's beliefs and principles they personally accept. Two final questions asked how many times per month they attend formal religious services (open-ended), and how often they pray per week outside formal religious services (on a 4-point scale from "0 times" to "5 or more"). Given the reported connection between RWA attitudes and conventional religious attitudes and devotional practices, along with the connection between RWA and intrinsic religiosity, we anticipated a positive correlation between RWA scores and responses to each of these items. Fowler's Faith Stages 2 and 3: Fowler (1981) has focused on how one construes "ulti- mate reality," rather than on the specific content of one's religious beliefs. From the theory's developmental perspective, religious growth is seen as a gradual process of evolution through six stages of reasoning about ultimate reality. An author-constructed instrument to measure four faith stages was developed for research purposes in order to bypass Fowler's (1981) lengthy interview technique. Preliminary evidence exists to suppprt the scale's valid- ity.1 Faith Stage 2 (mythic-literal faith) is an unreflective faith characterized primarily by literalness of beliefs. Stage 3 (synthetic-conventional faith) is a committed, consensual faith that is characterized by a strong but tacit and unexamined synthesis of beliefs. This stage is 1. Forty-six statements were written with item content based explicitly on Fowler's (1981) descriptions. For instance, items were constructed for Stage 2 based on the following major themes inherent in that stage: relationships and roles, God as a kind or punishing parent, reciprocity in divine and human relationships, moral absoluteness, literal beliefs, devotions and prayers as currency for future exchanges, and anthropomorphic images. The following is an example of a Stage 2 item: "To me, God is much like a parent, someone who rewards good actions and punishes bad ones." All statements were answered on a 5-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Six students in a psychology of religion seminar served as content validity judges. Based on their analysis, the scale was reduced to 38 items. Following this, an iterative item analysis procedure was conducted (i.e., items with the lowest item-total correlations were deleted one at a time until no further increase in coefficient alpha was obtained). This resulted in the deletion of eight further items. The alpha reliability estimates for the final faith stage scales were .55, .80, .72, and .55 for Stages 2 through 5, respectively. Empirically based evidence for the validity of the faith stage scale has been reported by Jugel (1992, 1993) as part of her master's thesis and predoctoral work at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. It should also be noted that at the time the above scales were being developed, alternative measures of faith stages and "faith styles" were also being constructed independent of our work (cf. Barnes, Doyle, and Johnson, 1989; Green and Hoffman, 1989).</page><page sequence="4">248 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION characterized by an emphasis on an outer-directed, social conformity orientation. Given the authoritarian's conventional and unexamined belief system, it was predicted that the RWA scale would correlate positively with these two faith stages. Religious Belief and Commitment scale: The 16-item short form of the Faith Maturity Scale (labeled Religious Belief and Commitment-Short Form [RBC-SF]; Erickson 1992) mea- sures adolescent religious commitment, and the items emphasize traditional religious con- tent and themes (e.g., frequency of Bible study and prayer). The RBC-SF correlates strongly with various measures of traditional religiousness, such as intrinsic religiosity. Based on item content and its correlations with other religious variables, it appears that this scale is comparable to Stage 3 faith development in Fowler's theory, and thus it was expected to cor- relate positively with the RWA scale.2 Measures of Religious Maturity. It is hard to imagine a theory of religious maturity that would be imune to criticism. Thus to overcome the limitations inherent in any single theoretical conceptualiztion, we based our operationalizations on two of the dominant theories of maturity within the psychology of religion: Fowler's (1981) faith development theory and Allport's (1950) theory of mature religiousness. Fowler's Faith Stages 4 and 5: Faith Stage 4 (Individuative-reflective faith) is the product of a maturing cognitive complexity, sophistication of thought, and the development of critical reflection about one's faith. Stage 5 (conjunctive faith) is an evolution of faith to- ward a tentativeness and a realization that one's beliefs are partial and limited, with a cor- responding openness to other faith traditions. These stages stand in stark contrast to the authoritarian's rigid, closed-off, and compartmentalized orientation to religious issues, thus we expected that the RWA scale would be negatively correlated with these two faith stages. Global Faith Development scale: Leak and Loucks (1994) developed a brief, 8-item measure of relatively mature faith development (FDS). Initially 13 items were placed in a provisional scale and arranged in a forced-choice format with one option keyed for relatively mature faith development (i.e., Stage 4 or 5), while its alternative reflected less mature faith (Stage 2 or 3). An example is: "It is very important for me to critically examine my religious beliefs and values" (greater faith development) versus "It is very important for me to accept the religious beliefs and values of my church." Content validity was established based on agreement among two well-known authors in the psychology of religion and two theologians who teach Fowler's theory. Content validity and reliability-assessments resulted in an 8- item scale (a = .72; 5-week test-retest reliability r = .96). Quest scale: Batson's quest orientation, developed within an Allportian framework, was measured with the recently developed 12-item modification (Batson and Schoenrade 199 lb) of the original Interactional scale. The Quest scale measures an approach to religious issues characterized by an openness to doubt and a willingness to examine religious issues without reducing their inherent complexity. Extensive evidence exists to support the validity of the original scale (Batson and Schoenrade 1991a), and thus much of the validity of the re- vised scale is "inherited" (Batson, Schoenrade, and Ventis 1993). This research is the first to use Batson's 12-item Q scale in RWA research, as well as the three conceptually derived Q subscales: (a) readiness to face existential questions with- out reducing their inherent complexity, (b) perception of religious doubts as something posi- tive, and (c) openness to change (Batson and Schoenrade 1991a).3 We predicted that the 2. Because the IR scale correlates positively with RWA, we expected the RBC-SF to do so also. We used the RBC-SF scale because the IR scale has frequently been criticized, and the attacks have become increasingly intense. Part of our present sample (n = 29) completed the IR scale also, and the correlation with the RBC-SF was substantial (r = .69). 3. We included the 12-item version of quest for two reasons: its reliability is superior to the original scale (a = .82 in this research), and we believed it was important to assess the connection between authoritarianism and quest using a version developed by Batson, rather than a scale modified by others (for which there is very little validity evidence).</page><page sequence="5">CLARIFICATION OF THE LINK BETWEEN RIGHT-WING AUTHORITARIANISM AND RELIGIOUSNESS 249 RWA scale would correlate negatively with the Q scale and its subscales because religion-as- quest is incompatible with the authoritarian's reliance on authority as a source of knowledge and justification within the religious realm, and also because authoritarians have demon- strated less complexity in their reasoning about religious issues (Pratt, Hunsberger, Pancer, and Roth 1992). Allport religious maturity index: One item asked subjects to rate the extent to which the description of a hypothetical person described them. The statement was taken from Allport's (1950) description of a religiously mature person. It contained aspects of religious maturity such as an emphasis on growth and process, critical reflection on beliefs, religion as a "master-motive" in the life of the person that influences his or her actions on a daily ba- sis, and religion as an aid in the search for answers to questions about the meaning of life. The subjects indicated their belief in the accuracy of the statement as a description of them on a 5-point scale from not at all accurate (1) to very accurate (5). Consistent with the rea- soning presented above, we expected the RWA scale to correlate negatively with a measure of religious maturity derived explicitly from Allport's influential theorizing. RESUTLTS Table 1 presents the correlations between the RWA scale and the religious variables. Consistent with prior work, it appears that authoritarianism is positively associated with various measures of orthodox, conventional and outer-directed religiousness. Specifically, the RWA scale was correlated with the self-reported importance of being religious in both a traditional way and a spiritual way (rs = .35 and .3 1), belief orthodoxy (r = .52 with the CO scale and r = .45 with reported percent of church's beliefs the subject accepts), Stage 2 and Stage 3 faith development (rs = .46 and .55), and devout religious commitment and devo- tionalism (RWA correlations with the RBC-SF scale, church attendance and frequency of prayer were .48, .29, and .35, respectively [all ps reported above &lt; .0 1]). Consistent with our view that authoritarianism is inversely related to a mature reli- gious orientation, the RWA scale was negatively correlated with all five measures of reli- gious maturity or advanced faith development, specifically, global faith development (r = -.51), Stage 4 and Stage 5 faith development (rs = -.33 and -.22), Quest (r = -.40; all ps &lt; .01), and the single-item measure derived from Allport's conceptualization of religious maturity (r = -.20, p &lt; .05). Table 1 also reveals that the RWA scale was negatively correlated with all three Quest subscales.4 The only research examining the correlations between authoritarianism and quest religiosity was done by Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1992). They used two versions of quest: McFarland's (1989) 10-item scale and a 16-item quest scale they developed. The correlations between RWA and the other versions of quest ranged from -.27 to -.67. 4. Altemeyer categorizes subjects into high and low authoritarian groups based on quartile splits. We supplemented our correlational results with F-tests using his method of analysis. The results paralleled the correlational analysis with two exceptions: There was not a significant difference on the 1-item Allport measure nor the Stage 5 faith scale as a function of high versus low RWA group membership (See Table 1).</page><page sequence="6">250 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION TABLE 1 RIGHT-WING AUTHORITARIANISM (RWA) SCALE CORRELATIONS AND MEAN DIFFERENCES ON THE RELIGION VARIABLES AS A FUNCTION OF AUTHORITARIANISM Means for Means for r Low RWAs High RWAs F RWA Correlates with Measures of Conventional Religiousness: Christian Orthodoxy Scale .52** 29.1 39.5 25.8** Religious in a traditional way .35** 2.6 3.3 6.5* Religious in spiritual way .31** 3.2 3.9 8.1** Interest in religion .20* 3.5 4.1 7.4** Percent church's beliefs one accepts .45** 58.9 85.0 27.3** Frequent of church attendance .29** 2.3 3.7 7.3** Frequency of prayer .35** 2.3 3.1 12.8** Stage 2 faith development .46** 21.1 29.1 28.2** Stage 3 faith development .55** 35.9 46.8 33.6** Religious Belief &amp; Commitment Scale .48** 48.1 60.8 22.6** RWA Correlates with Measures of Mature Religiousness Stage 4 faith development -.33** 30.6 25.2 18.0** Stage 5 faith development -.22** 26.7 24.9 3.7 Faith stage composite -.57** 0.0 -25.8 41.9** Global Faith Development scale (FDS) -.51** 13.8 11.2 37.8** Religion-as-Quest scale -.40** 56.9 44.9 23.5** Quest subscale I: Complexity -.23** 17.8 14.7 8.2** Quest subscale II: Doubts -.35** 18.8 15.3 11.1** Quest subscale III: Openness -.39** 20.3 14.9 24.4** Allport maturity item -.20* 3.5 3.1 2.8 Note: Faith stage composite = (Stage 5 + Stage 4) - (Stage 2 + Stage 3). Following Altemeyer's practice, High and Low RWA groups were formed by selecting subjects who scored in the top (n = 39) and bottom (n = 38) quartile on the RWA scale. Correlational results are based on the total sample of 157. DISCUSSION The value of this research is two fold. First, our understanding of the relationship be- tween right-wing authoritarianism and a previously neglected aspect of personal religious- ness, religious maturity, was greatly enhanced. As expected, we consistently found a nega- tive association between authoritarianism and religious maturity, and this should work to counteract the long-held and simplistic view that religion automatically goes hand in hand with negative social attitudes such as right-wing authoritarianism. Further, these findings were established using various operationalizations of maturity that were derived from the two dominant theories of religious maturity in the psychology of religion (Allport and Fowler). As a consequence, our conclusions about the relationship between authoritarianism and religiousness are not likely to be limited to one conceptualization of maturity alone. This is especially important, given the various criticisms leveled against Fowler's theory of faith development.5 5. Scholars have criticized numerous apects of Fowler's theory (e.g., Broughton 1986; Kwilecki 1988; 1992; Parks 1991; Slee 1991). It is beyond the scope of this empirical study to detail these criticisms, but an acknowledgement of the problems may remind us that Fowler's theory, while highly influential, is not universally accepted. Generally, the criticisms have focused on the theory's Christian and biblical "imperialism," insensitivity to class and gender issues, its merging of the scientific with the prescriptive, and especially the suggestion of a universal normative end point, a grounding in Piagetian theory with its emphasis on the cognitive to the exclusion of the affective and behavioral, and finally the practical issues involving the criteria, coding, and scoring of Fowler's faith development interview. It should also be noted that Fowler and his associates have tried to counter many of these charges (e.g., Moseley, Jarvis, and Fowler 1993).</page><page sequence="7">CLARIFICATION OF THE LINK BETWEEN RIGHT-WING AUTHORITARIANISM AND RELIGIOUSNESS 251 We believe our research has value for a second reason. Prior research has shown that right-wing authoritarianism is positively associated with many forms of religiousness (e.g., orthodoxy, church attendance). This research has added greater coherence and understand- ing to our knowledge of the precise ways in which authoritarianism is positively associated with religiosity. Specifically, authoritarianism was associated with both immature religious- ness (e.g., Stage 2 faith development) as well as a more sincere, committed and devout forms of religiousness (e.g., frequent devotional practices, such as prayer, and a strong Stage 3 con- ventional faith development). Naturally, whether or not those committed and conventional forms of religiousness are viewed as positive or negative is open to debate (cf. Batson, Schoenrade and Ventis 1993, chaps. 7-11; Kwilecki 1992). What seems less open to debate are two important conclusions about right-wing authoritarianism: It is negatively associated with advanced faith development; and it is positively associated with a religion that is con- ventional, unquestioned, and unreflected. Our research strengthens a conclusion that ap- pears to be common sense in retrospect: Being religious does not insulate one from authori- tarian tendencies, nor does it condemn one to those same tendencies.
