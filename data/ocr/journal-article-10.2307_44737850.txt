McCann and Stephen A. Ridella TRW Automotive Jonathan D. Rupp University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute Ana Barbir, Robin van der Made and Paul Slaats TNO-MADYMO North America Copyright © 2004 SAE International ABSTRACT Injuries to the knee-thigh-hip (KTH) complex in frontal motor vehicle crashes are of substantial concern because of their frequency and potential to result in long-term disability. Current frontal impact Anthropometric Test Dummies (ATDs) have been shown to respond differently than human cadavers under frontal knee impact loading and consequently current ATDs (and FE models thereof) may lack the biofidelity needed to predict the incidence of knee, thigh, and hip injuries in frontal crashes. These concerns demand an efficient and biofidelic tool to evaluate the occurrence of injuries as a result of KTH loading in frontal crashes. The MADYMO human finite element (FE) model was therefore adapted to simulate bone deformation, articulating joints and soft tissue behavior in the KTH complex. To validate this model, the knee-femur complex response was compared to results of post-mortem human subject (PMHS) experiments where a distributed load was applied to the knee while the femoral head rested on a fixed acetabular cup. The model was also validated against experimental whole KTH response data, in which the pelvis was fixed at the iliac wings and a distributed load was applied to the knee. These experiments showed that the acetabulum is the weakest structure in typical knee bolster loading, followed by femoral head and femoral shaft. The simulations replicated the experimentally observed force-deflection response and predicted the highest stress at the experimentally observed locations of bony fracture. INTRODUCTION Early crash data [Melvin et al., 1976] and biomechanical studies [Patrick et al., 1966; Powell et al., 1974, 1975; Melvin et al., 1975, 1976] indicated that the femur was the weakest link in the knee-thigh-hip (KTH) complex. Consequently, these biomechanical studies were used to establish a femur injury criterion of 10 kN for loading directed along the length of the femur. This criterion was implemented as a KTH criterion in FMVSS 208, stating that the force at mid-femur of a mid-sized male Hybrid-Ill should not exceed 10 kN. Morgan et al. [1989] correlated the 10 kN tolerance to a 35 % risk of AIS2+ injury to the KTH complex. A recent analysis of the NASS (National Automotive Sampling System) real-world frontal crash data from 1995- 2000 by Rupp et al. [2002] shows that annually approximately 30,000 occupants sustain AIS2+ injuries to the KTH complex in frontal crashes, of which about 47 % are to the hip, predominantly acetabulum and femoral head fractures. The NASS data also shows that the risks of knee, thigh, and hip/pelvis injuries all increase with increasing crash severity, but that the largest numbers of hip/pelvis injuries occur at crash severities that are equal to or below current regulatory and consumer testing levels in FMVSS 208 and NCAP. The risk of AIS2+ knee, thigh, and hip/pelvis injuries was also found to depend on the type of restraints used, but in all cases the risk to hip/pelvis injuries was the highest. The high number of hip injuries in the NASS data published by Rupp et al. [2002] is of significant concern since hip injuries are clinically more severe and more 47</page><page sequence="2">difficult to treat than injuries to either the knee or thigh. Hip injuries often result in lifelong impaired gait [Nerubay et al., 1973] and account for the majority of life years lost due to KTH injuries in car crashes [Kuppa et al., 2001]. Rupp et al. [2002, 2003b] investigated the frontal impact fracture tolerance of the hip in thirty-five tests on PMHS KTH complexes. The acetabulum was found to be the weakest part of the KTH complex. Rupp et al. [2003a] measured the stiffness and strength of the knee-femur complex, developed a knee/femur force-deflection response corridor, and compared the knee/femur response of Hybrid III ATD to this response corridor, which suggests that the Hybrid III may not respond in a biofidelic manner to frontal knee impact and consequently may not be able to assess the risks of knee, thigh and particularly hip injuries in frontal crashes. Numerical models of the human body could facilitate a solution to this problem, since they provide an efficient means to assess the loading on the human body in a range of crash conditions. Human body models can also be used to evaluate restraint systems that may mitigate the injury risk to the KTH complex. METHODS An efficient numerical tool to evaluate bone failure in the KTH complex was developed by creating a finite element (FE) mesh of bones and soft tissues, generating contact models that interact between the various tissues, assigning material parameters from literature and then validating the model against Post Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) experiments in loading conditions comparable to knee bolster loading. MESH DEVELOPMENT The finite element mesh applied for this model was developed within the European Human Model for Safety (HUMOS) project [Robin, 2001]. A 3D visualization was created from a digitization of a single PMHS in a driving position. The anthropometry of the PMHS closely resembled that of a 50th percentile male, which is shown in Table 1. Table 1: Anthropometry of HUMOS PMHS compared to a 50th percentile male [Robin, 2001] HUMOS PMHS 50th percentile male Height (mm) 1730 1750 Sitting Height 920 915 (mm) Weight (kg) 80 75Ü The mesh size was determined by a previously defined criterion that the minimum Courant time step for the calculation approximated 1.0E-6 seconds. The FE code used for this study was MADYMO v6.1 [MADYMO, 2003] in which the relationship between minimum Courant time step At and mesh parameters length L, density p and Young's modulus E was given by the following equation: At &lt; lJ^ (1) The resulting mesh consisted of 508 quadratic shell elements representing the cortical bone of one femur, 916 quadratic shell elements for cortical bone of the pelvis, 413 shell elements for the skin and 467 solid elements for the flesh around knee and leg, as is shown in Figure 1. All shell elements comprised two integration points throughout the thickness of the element. Cancellous bone stiffness and strength are two orders of magnitude lower than that of cortical bone [Dalstra, 1993]. Therefore, the trabecular bone mesh itself was not implemented, while its mechanical behavior was lumped into the cortical bone mesh. The leg was furthermore modeled by deformable patella, tibia and fibula and a rigid foot. Figure 1. Human FE lower extremity mesh as developed from HUMOS [Robin, 2001] Connective tissues comprised 14 muscles in the lower extremity represented by 1D truss elements. Furthermore, the most important knee ligaments such as medial, lateral, anterior and posterior collateral ligaments and the patellar ligament are modeled in a 2D membrane element 48</page><page sequence="3">configuration. In the leg the interassea cruris membrane and Achilles tendon were modeled as 2D membranes as well. The joint capsules in the lower extremity were not modeled within the scope of this study. CONTACT MODELS Contact models were defined between the various FE models of bones and soft tissues. The interaction between flesh and bone was defined by a penalty based contact, where the penetration was minimized by applying a contact force based on the bulk modulus of the mesh and a penalty factor to ensure model stability. Contact between two bones is in a physiological environment controlled by a layer of cartilage, ensuring a low-friction sliding surface and visco-elastic compression damping. In the absence of a mesh for cartilage, a contact function was defined between two bones where a contact force is generated in the gap between the two bones, going towards a near infinitely stiff contact as soon as two bones contact each other, i.e. the thickness of the cartilage layer is reduced to zero. The non-linear elastic stiffness curve up to 1.5 MN/m2 is derived from quasi- static confined compression experiments performed on human articular cartilage [Hori and Mockros, 1976], while the remainder of the curve is exponentially increasing to simulate a near-infinitely stiff contact. The composed stiffness function is shown in Figure 2. The abscissa denotes the ratio of the amount of penetration p and the element thickness t. In order to simulate loading rate sensitivity a damping coefficient of 1000 N m"2 s"1 is introduced. 6.E+09 „ 5.E+09 iV „ CN / E 4.E+09 -h - 3.E+09 J- &lt;/&gt; / 2 2.E+09 ļ - " ~~r - n F+nļ ààêêéé a ■ I ♦ 0 0.2' 0.4 0.6 0.8 ' P/t [-] expanded view 1E+07 _ ^ ■ 8.E+06 ' &lt; A » J 6.E+06 S 4.E+06 0) » 2.E+06 0.E+00 I» f »»T . . 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 p/t [-] Figure 2. Non-linear bone-cartilage-bone stiffness function MATERIAL PROPERTIES The material models chosen for the model were defined between ranges found in experimental literature. Table 3 and Table 4 show the large variability of Young's modulus and ultimate stress under different test conditions as observed by different authors. The material properties that were derived for the model are shown in Table 2 Cortical bone is assumed to behave as a linear isotropic elastic- plastic material under the specified loading conditions. The yield stress in the model marks the transition from elastic to perfect plastic loading. At yielding bone failure is defined to occur and therefore the yield stress in the model is equal to the ultimate stress observed experimentally. Flesh characteristics are based on a transverse compression test on porcine muscle [Robin, 2001] with the assumptions that Poisson's ratio equals zero and that the tensile properties are equal to the compressive properties. Skin non-linear elastic properties are based on experimental tensile tests, while compressive stiffness is nearly zero [Robin, 2001].

First, the femur material and mesh properties were validated against PMHS tests where the knee was impacted and the femoral head was supported on a rigid stainless steel cup representing the acetabulum [Rupp, 2003a]. After femur validation, the model was validated against similar experiments with a full KTH complex where the pelvis was rigidly supported at iliac wings and pubic symphysis [Rupp, 2002]. Knee-Femur Response Tests Twenty PMHS knee-femur specimen were tested as described by Rupp et al. [2002]. In brief, knee/femur specimen were obtained by disarticulating the hip. Flesh was removed from proximal femur to expose the mid-shaft and femoral head. The specimen was mounted in a test apparatus as shown in Figure 5. The impactor at the knee was molded in the shape of the knee of each specimen separately, so that the load was distributed over femoral condyles and patella, thus minimizing boundary effects at the knee. The femoral head was supported by a hemispherical cup, which is shown to minimize inertial effects in the KTH complex [Rupp, 2002]. The impactor system was designed to apply an impact velocity around 1.2 m/s. This impact velocity produced loading rates at the knee similar to those measured in a Hybrid III femur load cell during FMVSS 208 testing of a newer model vehicle [Rupp, 2003a]. A load cell just behind the molded impactor interface measured loads applied to the KTH complex. In post-processing all forces and displacements are filtered with a order Butterworth filter at 300 Hz, while the ram load cell forces are compensated for inertial effects. 50</page><page sequence="5">Figure 5. Test apparatus for KTH tests [Rupp, 2002] To simulate the Rupp et al. tests in the MADYMO environment, shown in Figure 6, the FE lower extremity model is changed such that the pelvis nodes are rigidly supported to the reference frame, thus representing the rigid stainless steel cup. The molded knee interface is modeled by copying part of the skin around the knee and defining it as a rigid surface at a slight offset from the original skin. The impactor pulse is a result of the pneumatic actuator, the sled, the energy-absorbing material and the PMHS specimen itself. Therefore in the simulation the impactor deflection measured in the experiment is used as the input to the system. As a result, the forces measured at the simulated knee impactor are the responses. All responses are filtered with an SAE J211 CFC 600 filter. Figure 6. Test apparatus for knee-femur tests [Rupp, 2003a] (left) and MADYMO model of test setup (right) Knee-Thiah-Hio Tolerance Tests For hip tolerance tests a similar test setup was used. However, for these tests the acetabular joint and the pelvis were included in the specimen, as shown in Figure 7. The orientation of the femur relative to the pelvis was such that a standard automotive-seated posture was achieved [Schneider, 1983]. Since failure was expected in the acetabulum, the iliac wings and pubic symphysis were clamped and therefore supported to the reference frame. The loading rate was targeted below 300 N/ms, comparable to 50th percentile male Hybrid III FMVSS 208 compliance testing. In the MADYMO modeling environment the impactor at the knee was again modeled by a rigid mesh in the shape of the skin, while the pelvic support was modeled by supporting the nodes of the iliac wings and the pubic symphysis to the reference space. Figure 7. Test apparatus for KTH tests [Rupp, 2002] (left) and MADYMO model of test setup (right) RESULTS Knee-femur Response Tests The input provided to the model with rigid pelvis was the displacement history of the ram as measured from one representative experiment. The curve is shown in Figure 8 and provides an impact speed of 1.5 m/s, averaged over the duration of the experiment. The response of the model is computed from the load cell in the knee ram. The resulting force is shown in Figure 9. Figure 8. Displacement history as measured from knee-femur test [Rupp, 2003a] and applied to MADYMO FE lower extremity model with rigid pelvis From the force and displacement histories the force- deflection curve can be plotted, as is shown in Figure 10. The model response is compared with the corridors defined by Rupp et al. [2003a]. The corridor is derived from 20 cadaveric knee-femur complex tests, where the upper and lower bounds represent plus and minus one standard- deviation around the mean response curve. 51</page><page sequence="6">Figure 9. Force history as computed from MADYMO FE lower extremity model with rigid pelvis Figure 10. Force-deflection curve as computed from MADYMO FE lower extremity model with rigid pelvis (red) compared with knee-femur corridors (black) [Rupp, 2003a] The experimental femur, upon loading through the knee, primarily bent at the mid-shaft at first, as can be seen in Figure 1 1 . After 20 ms the femoral head started to bend as well at its thinnest cross-section, followed by a transverse fracture of the femoral neck at 23 ms after impact. The simulation in Figure 11 on the right displays similar behavior. Early after impact the mid-shaft femur bends, later followed by extreme plastic deformation in the thinnest cross-section of the femoral head. The femoral neck failure in the model correlates to fractures locations observed experimentally, where all specimens failed in the femoral neck and two specimens had an additional distal shaft fracture. Figure 11.

The highest stresses, denoted in red, occur in the thinner part of the femoral neck, while slightly lower values are observed in the more proximal part of the shaft. Figure 12. Bottom view of femur: Von Mises stress at 25 ms after impact for MADYMO FE lower extremity model with rigid pelvis (red is highest stress, blue is lowest stress) Knee-Thiqh-Hip Tolerance Tests The KTH complex is evaluated by applying a loading rate below 300 N/ms. A typical ram displacement history resulting from this impact is shown in Figure 13. This displacement is applied to the ram in the model. 52</page><page sequence="7">Figure 13. Displacement history as measured from KTH test [Rupp, 2002] and applied to MADYMO FE lower extremity model The force history response of the model is shown in Figure 14. The force history is compared with corridors that have been developed from 19 cadaveric KTH tests [Rupp, 2002]. The upper bound on the corridor is defined by the maximum allowable loading rate at 300 N/ms. The lower corridor is defined by the lowest occurring loading rate in the experimental test series. The model response lies within the corridor, except in the first 10 ms where soft tissue model compliance plays an important role. Figure 14. Force history as computed from MADYMO FE lower extremity model (red) compared with KTH corridors (black) [Rupp, 2002] From the force and deflection responses, a force- deflection curve is developed in Figure 15. Depending on the used definition for KTH stiffness, this curve displays a stiffness between 270 and 450 N/mm which is slightly higher than the value computed from the corresponding cadaveric experiments at 233 ±110 N/mm. Figure 15. Force-deflection curve as computed from MADYMO FE lower extremity model In both the Rupp et al. tests and the model, slight bending of the femur occurs. However, the bending can not be observed in Figure 16 since it occurs in the plane of the image. After initial bending in the femur, the acetabulum fractures whereupon the femur displaces rapidly in the direction of the force vector. This failure mode also correlates with the 19 cadaveric tests since 14 specimen fractured in the acetabulum, 3 in the femoral neck, one at the iliac wing clamp and one specimen had no injury. The Von Mises stress distribution at 40 ms is shown in Figure 17. The highest stresses occur in the acetabulum, posteriorly at first and later throughout. Allowing large plastic deformations after yielding, the femur displacement is large while the hip contact remains intact. Figure 16. Lateral view of KTH experiment [Rupp, 2002] (left) compared with MADYMO FE lower extremity model (right) 53</page><page sequence="8">Figure 17. Isometric view of femur and pelvis: Von Mises stress at 40 ms after impact for MADYMO FE lower extremity model (red is highest stress, blue is lowest stress) Influence of Femur Element Thickness To tune the model to match the experimental results a variable femur wall thickness was used. The importance of applying a variable wall thickness in order to predict the location of injury is demonstrated below. The simulation of the base model, with femur diaphysis thickness of 4 mm and epiphysis thickness of 2 mm, is compared with a model with uniform femur element thickness of 3 mm. The force response for the two models corresponding to an equal displacement input is shown in Figure 18. The responses are very similar. However, in observing the failure modes in Figure 19 it shows that with a uniform thickness all deformation occurs in the mid-shaft of the femur, while the model with variable thickness shows slight bending in the mid-shaft and large plastic deformation in the femoral neck, the latter correlating better with cadaveric experiments. Figure 18. Force history of MADYMO FE lower extremity model with rigid pelvis for variable element thickness compared with uniform element thickness Figure 19. Bottom view of MADYMO FE lower extremity model with rigid pelvis at 25 ms for variable element thickness (left) and uniform element thickness (right) Similarly, high Von Mises stresses are only observed in the mid-shaft femur of the uniform thickness model, as Figure 20 shows, while in cadaveric testing failure is predominantly observed in the femoral neck. Therefore, the model with variable thickness better simulates the most frequently observed failure location. Figure 20. Bottom view of femur: Von Mises stress at 25 ms after impact for MADYMO FE lower extremity model with rigid pelvis for variable element thickness (left) and uniform element thickness (right) (red is highest stress, blue is lowest stress) DISCUSSION The developed FE lower extremity model is computationally efficient with a minimum Courant time step of 1 .OE-6 seconds. The detailed FE mesh of skin and flesh around the knee allows for accurate contact descriptions between the lower extremity model and a model of the automotive interior, e.g. knee bolster subsystem with or without an air bag. The developed FE models of femur and pelvis correlate with the corridor developed from cadaveric experimental testing under impact conditions similar to a typical frontal crash with a constrained pelvis and a blow on the knee in anterior-posterior direction. However, the force-deflection response of the knee-femur complex simulation, shown in Figure 10, lies in the upper boundary of the experimental corridor. Corridors are developed from elderly and generally osteopenic subjects, with a generally lower tolerance than normal and younger subjects. Therefore, a model response in the upper bound of a corridor indicates a more tolerant model response, which is a better representative of the average population. The simulations show that the current FE lower extremity model predicts both the KTH force response and the location of failure under knee impact loading. Where failure in isolated knee-femur experiments predominantly occurs at the femoral neck, simulations show high stress and high plastic deformation on the same location. In KTH complex tests bending and fairly high stresses are observed in mid-shaft femur and femoral neck, but the 54</page><page sequence="9">highest stresses and plastic deformation are observed in the acetabulum, which correlates with the experimental observations. In the experiments used for the validation of the model, fracture was assumed to occur at the time of peak applied force. No high speed X-ray or strain gage data was available to verify the occurrence of fractures. The implementation of an elastic model with perfect plasticity after the yield stress is reached does not describe the phenomena of a brittle bone fracture correctly. However, the model does describe material degeneration. After yielding the stiffness of an element rapidly decreases, thus increasing the load on surrounding elements that are then more likely to fail as well. A similar cascade effect occurs in brittle bone fractures, even though after fracture stiffness is immediately reduced to zero. As a result of the difference in material behavior between bone and the elastic-plastic model, no physical failure tolerance criterion is developed within this study. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn on the capacity of the model to predict the correct timing of fracture. A criterion based on a percentage effective plastic strain reached after yielding [van Rooij, 2003] or a damage evolution law may need to be developed. In the current FE models of femur and pelvis the bone model is simplified in order to increase computational efficiency. In reality, a bone is composed of an external layer of stiff cortical bone and an inside of more compliant trabecular bone, bone marrow and fluids. The stiffness of cortical bone is typically an order of 2 higher than the stiffness of trabecular bone. In the diaphysis of the femur, which is composed of a thick layer of cortical bone, the influence of bone marrow is negligible. However, in the femoral head the layer of cortical bone is thinner and the trabecular bone is denser. In addition, the femoral head is mostly loaded under compression, in which the inner constituents of a bone might play a more important role. The same holds for the pelvis, presumably even to a larger extent. The cortical bone thickness is known to vary between 0.5 and 2.0 mm [Dalstra, 1993]. The trabecular bone is densely present throughout the pelvis and locally optimized for physiological loading conditions. CONCLUSIONS The currently developed FE lower extremity model is in this study shown to correlate with cadaveric experiments of the KTH complex under loading conditions similar to those experienced in a frontal car crash. The model follows the corridors of the impactor force response and predicts the location of fracture as observed experimentally. Due to the simplified material model for bone currently no conclusions can be drawn on the capacity of the model to predict the timing of bone failure. In addition, the influence of trabecular bone on the model response was not considered. REFERENCES 1.
