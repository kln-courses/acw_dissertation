It has also become clear that such in-depth analyses have to be conducted by trained specialists followed by recombination of the datasets. Our current paper presents successful cooperative efforts in a case study concerning specific raw material types in the lithic assemblage from Stratzing-Galgenberg, one of the most important Aurignacian open-air sites in Central Europe. The structure of our study follows the imperative analytical steps to achieve conclusive results for such an investigation. First, we demonstrate the application of the analytical classification system used for stereomicroscopic single artefact raw material determination. Secondly, we discuss the problematic nature of purely macroscopic raw material investigation for particular raw material types, in this case Southern Moravian chert varieties. Subsequently, the behavioural assessments focus on the results provided by raw material analyses and allow for preliminary reflections concerning resource management strategies of late Aurignacian hunter-gatherer societies in the Middle Danube region. KEY WORDS: Stratzing-Galgenberg – Raw material studies – Southern Moravian chert – Lithic resource management INTRODUCTION (Neugebauer-Maresch 1999). The name of the site derives from the Galgenberg, a hill situated between the The Stratzing-Galgenberg site in Lower Austria villages of Gneixendorf, Krems-Rehberg/Imbach and represents the most extensive early Upper Palaeolithic Stratzing, raising to an elevation of 374 m a.s.l.

Moreover, MJC blanks with less than 40 % cortex account for 2/3 of cortical artefacts (N = 8). Keeping in mind the high degree of fragmentation of MJC artefacts, obviously larger blanks were preferentially selected for retouch (Figures 3, 4), with three from five formal tools exceeding 50 mm in length. Judging from the last negatives visible on the single MJC core, the final reduction stage possibly aimed at obtaining thick flakes to be transformed into carinated bladelet cores, such as the aforementioned Vachons burin. However, the question of a possible predetermination of flake production in the lithic technological system at Stratzing remains to be investigated. At the pene-contemporaneous late Aurignacian site Breitenbach, Germany, where flakes mainly represent by-products of the laminar operational sequences attested at the site, flakes for carinates appear to have been systematically struck off by hard hammer technique (Moreau 2012). Moreover, metrical analyses of both unretouched and retouched flakes indicate that at Breitenbach the selection of blanks for carinates was based primarily on thickness, not on morphology or technological class (Moreau 2012). DISCUSSION Classification systems are important tools for data comparison and for the evaluation of archaeological find material that extend beyond lithic studies (e.g. Luedtke 1992). Coherent systems allow for testing hypotheses; furthermore, combinatorial conclusions drawn from the evaluation of a sound database are essential for shaping theories in archaeological sciences. However, a classification system is only as useful as the FIGURE 5. Stratzing-Galgenberg (excavations 1988–1991). information contained within the database.

CONCLUSION ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The application of the newly implemented 2013 classification system to the material from Stratzing- Dr. Luc Moreau was supported by the German Galgenberg has demonstrated the importance of Science Foundation (DFG) (Grant No. MO-2369/1). recording clearly defined and diagnostic parameters of lithic artefacts. This system can be utilised as a powerful tool for prehistoric research; however, our case study has also stressed the importance of the adaptability of such REFERENCES a system.
