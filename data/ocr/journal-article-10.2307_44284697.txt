<plain_text><page sequence="1">GIOCONDA BELLI'S THE INHABITED WOMAN : ARCHITECTURE, REVOLUTION, THE THIRD STYLE, SPACE AND WAY Fredric Jameson underscores the centrality of architecture in postmodernism: "It is then in the realm of architecture, however, that modi- fications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated; it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of postmodernism initially began to emerge. More decisively than in the other arts or media, postmodernist positions in architecture have been insepa- rable from an implacable critique of architectural high modernism" ( Postmodernism , 2). Charles Jencks offers the following definition of postmodernism: "To this day I would define Post-Modernism as I did in 1978 as a double- coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usu- ally traditional building ) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority " ( What is Post-Modernism? , 14). In ar- chitectural terms, the postmodern is an architecture that was professionally based and popular as well as one that was based on new techniques and old patterns. Double-coding to simplify means both elite/popular and new/old and there are compelling reasons for these opposite pairings. Today's Post-Modern architects were trained by Modernists, and are committed to using contemporary technology as well as facing current social reality. These commitments are enough to distinguish them from revivalists or traditionalists, a point worth stressing since it creates their hybrid language, the style of Post-Modern architecture. The same is not completely true of Post-Modern artists and writers who may use traditional techniques of narrative and representation in a more straightforward way. (14). Jencks' last statement raises the two issues of narrative and representation, central concerns of postmodern architecture and literature. Another com- mon point is the notion of the hybrid, be it architectural, cultural or literary. 35</page><page sequence="2">36 HISPANIC JOURNAL Robert A. M. Stem says that postmodernist architecture is charac- terized by three stylistic hallmarks: contextualism, allusionism, and ornamentalism ("The Postmodern Continuum," 47). Moreover, he delin- eates its essential traits as "its rejection of modernism, and in particular late modernism with its claims that an ahistorical, non- or self-referential essentially materialistic view of architecture was the exclusively appro- priate position for contemporary architects" (47). His own definition of postmodern architecture underscores the ideas of hibridity, borrowing and exchanges between movements: "Post Modernism recognizes that build- ings are designed to mean something, that they are not hermetically sealed objects. Post-Modemism accepts diversity; it prefers hybrids to pure forms, it encourages multiple and simultaneous readings in its effort to heighten expressive content. Borrowing from forms and strategies of both the Mod- ern movement and the architecture that preceded it, it declares the past- ness of both. The layering of space characteristic of much Post-Modern architecture finds its complement in the overlay of cultural and historical references in the elevations. For the Post-Modernist, 'More is more'" (47). Stern's definition also rejects the self-referentiality of modernism, "a move- ment prevalent in the first half of the twentieth century in architecture, the other plastic arts, and, to a lesser extent, literature, a movement to create a self-referential, autonomous art, a movement that, for architects at least, is inherently contradictory, given the public character of building," (48), and embraces the multiplicity of narrative forms and meaning. This significational and narrative plurality also leads to the notion of the pluriverses and multiworlds that Stern portrays as "the layering of space." Since postmodern cuts across many disciplines, postmodern archi- tecture and literature are by no means mutually exclusive: "Postmodern is not post modern, whatever that might mean, but postmodernism; it does not come after the present (a solecism), but after the modernist movement. Thus the term 'postmodernism,' if we take it literally enough, Ã  la lettre, signifies a poetics which is the successor of, or possibly a reaction against, the poetics of early twentieth-century modernism, and some hypothetical writing of the future" ( Postmodernist Fiction, 5). Despite the fact that postmodernism is a discursive construct like modernism, "it is possible to construct them in a variety of ways. Similarly we can discriminate among constructions of postmodernism, none of them any less 'true' or less fic- tional than the others, since all of them are finally fictions" (5). As Brian</page><page sequence="3">THE INHABITED WOMAN 37 McHale stresses, "as for the prefix POST, here I want to emphasize the element of logical and historical consequence rather than sheer temporal posterity. Postmodernism follows from modernism, in some sense, more than it follows after modernism" (5). The title of Gioconda Belli's novel, The Inhabited Woman , estab- lishes the essential link between architecture and literature; that is, the ar- chitectural, literary and verbal spaces that we inhabit: "Architecture, as a discipline and intellectual practice, is dedicated to the design of inhabit- able space. But 'design' and 'inhabitability' appear as metaphors in other places as well (for example, when we speak of designing a metaphysical system or inhabiting an idea or piece of writing). The thrust of contempo- rary theory suggests that architecture is as dematerialized, as plural and textual, as the systems of intelligibility - language, science, geometry, graphic, and sculptural arts; it must employ to write itself' ("Lines and Linearity: Problems in Architectural Theory," 78)'. Linearity constitutes the cardinal principle in architecture: "That the discipline of architecture defines its boundaries and design capacities according to the workings of orthogonality ~ strictly defined, the 'right-angledness' of the line -seems indisputable. The line is the means by which architecture displays its con- ceptual accretions and is therefore at the end of the act of design" (66-7). The use of lines in architecture and literature seems so self-evident as to cloak the real complexity of linearity. Linearity, "a system of lines follow- ing the most efficient path, brings with it the mythical power of opening, grooving, and incising, that gives 'civilized life' ~ form, shape, visibility, and stature - to land art, and the human face" (72, 77-8). Linearity, or orthogonality, serves to "contain" or "boundarize," either physically or figu- ratively, the broiling non-linear movement of the borrowings, exchanges and interactions of past, present and future meanings. While part of the conflict between modernism's and postmodernism 's linearity derives from the former's self- or monoreferentiality and the latter 's multi- or plurireferentiality, they nevertheless share linearity: "The image's 'linear- ity' is presented as both its outline and its possibility (as a space-time event that could be mapped in various ways using representative techniques). Writing articulates this linearity explicitly as a line of writing. The plural- ity of the text is held in place, propped up, by its linearity, its legibility, its respect for the materiality of the page of the book" (79-80). Writing and literature "employ the 'architectural metaphor' as the trace of a material</page><page sequence="4">38 HISPANIC JOURNAL structure, a presence-structure, in order to preserve the architectural na- ture of discourse without attending to its material implications" (80). The novel's title relates to the idea of a dwelling: "From time imme- morial, the building of a dwelling place had been regulated by the idea that dwelling itself ~ having a home and occupying it, be it common or private ~ was a kind of favor, and therefore the building was supposed to be dedicated to the someone (something) who was considered to be the addressor of such a favor. When modernity began, the mode of dwelling that I would designate by the ancient Latin noun domus (in which the connotations I just mentioned are implied) started to vanish. I think that what was called modernism in architecture was directly linked to the dis- appearance" (Critical Architecture and Contemporary Culture, 191). Lyotard states that "we are presently at a moment when metropolises them- selves have to yield to a new form of settlement, the megalopolis. It is a response to the end of the predominantly (mechanical) industrial era and the disappearance of the workers associated with it" (191-2). The nature of the domus still persists in architects' minds, but it now requires new answers to be "inhabited" again. Architecture, as part of the overarching idea of development, enters the stage of the megalopolis which "is the response to development as it affects the ways of 'being together' and dwelling of the most developed parts of mankind" ( 1 94). Seen in this light, "criticisms, critical breaks, and revolutionary programs are part of the system's very development. They are useful for maintaining its openness. The appeals to humanism, consensus, the Third World, and the rights of man and woman must be understood as ways for the system to make itself more complete, flexible, and bearable for mankind, and therefore more able to mobilize all forms of human energy" (194). Lavinia's role as an architect thus revolves around what kind of domus will be created in the interstitial space she inhabits. The battle "lines" in the novel are drawn between the line/linearity (modernism/modernity) and the circle/circularity (postmodernism/ postmodernity); that is to say, what shape the "inhabited" space will take in the novel. The geometric shape of this inhabited space is embodied by the military base and the General's office where she goes to speak with him about the house she is designing for him: "They passed two more check point barriers until they came to a group of concrete buildings. On a smaller scale, they had the same heavy, monumental architecture of the structures in Mussolini's modem Rome: plain gray walls with geometric</page><page sequence="5">THE INHABITED WOMAN 39 bulk, rectangular proportions. General Vela's office offered the same mix- ture of bad taste and solid, cold architecture. The rest of the furnishings, made of vinyl and chrome, were supposed to be modern" ( The Inhabited Woman , 294). Lavinia's architectural ambitions follow a circular path as indicated by her view of the shopping center that her associate, Felipe, has asked her to examine: "The design was the usual boring one. It would make no difference if it were in any American suburb or in Faguas. The unimaginative angular lines were such a pity. She began to draw circles, allowing her impulses to guide her" (19). Her circular, inhabited space is also a battle zone: "She had mechanically scribbled on sheet after sheet of paper without paying attention to what she was doing, distracted by the damp caves of life; she looked over the sheets of paper before throwing them in the waste basket: firearms, pistols, rifles and - how odd - she'd sketched stylized antique blunderbusses and innumerable bows and arrows" (243-44). These two passages underscore the importance of the architec- tural imaginary in which the circular, organic, bellicose and organic shape of her architectural space is conceived, as if these mental transgressions enabled her to tap some creative, palimpsestuous substratum. Indeed, the somewhat Utopian projections of the revolution include Lavinia's architec- tural desires, which reach back to the past, live in the present and anticipate the future. Writing and architecture represent two kinds of inscriptionality which share a common physical and metaphorical space: "In the interior of writ- ing and architecture - which is where theory and philosophy and 'life' negotiate their terms - what begins as a material/spatial structure becomes figurative: mÃ©tonymie or metaphoric" ("Lines and Linearity: Problems in Architectural Theory," 80). Just as from architecture we "learn about the range of possible formulations of inhabitable space," so too we "inhabit the space of the word, and space between the words, with as much restric- tion and latitude as we inhabit rooms in a house" (80- 1 ). Within the macro- structural principles of orthogonality and orthographies, architecture and writing endeavor to transgress against their linear confinement; that is, "the complex resistance of an ideal system to its fallen state" (72). The ideal state of linearity (the pure geometric line), which is a "technical and scien- tific economy," starts to surpass this level "when the line increases its hold on it, asserting itself as the self-evident path toward clarity, rationality, harmony with nature and so forth. The slippage of the line's power is inau- gurated when one discovers that there is no linear path through the line</page><page sequence="6">40 HISPANIC JOURNAL itself' (73). The messy interiority of writing can take the form of "matri- ces of power, nomadic space, vector networks, wavy lines, or indirect paths" (72). Gioconda's Belli 's The Inhabited Woman (1988) belongs to the tra- dition of the novela testimonio which dominated the 80s in Central America and whose setting moves from the country to the city and its urban sec- tors: Toward the end of the decade of the eighties, in 1989, a year before the electoral defeat of the FSLN, testimonial literature leaves records of a march from the country toward the city. The mountain has ceased to be the space from which the new country will be built. The restlessness of living in inhospitable, unexplored, uninhabited, militarized nature is rewritten. Nicaraguan literature as a narrative of nation-state had to recognize the strength of urbanization and of the city's organization as the precondition for nation-building. The new country is predicated on urbanism. In this new topography of city as nation, woman enters the discussion. In 1988 Gioconda Belli, known primarily for her poetry, published La mujer habitada, a novel which dealt with the Sandinista revolution in the city. [It] is a novel plotting the participation of women in the armed struggles constituting revolutionary nations. (House I Garden! Nation, 169-70) The city "is a reconsideration of revolutionary tactics and strategy, it is an offensive looking for the enemy rather than waiting for it, it is the incorpo- ration of the masses into the struggle. As a discursive contribution of a certain relevance, privileging the urban spaces over the natural ones offers a feminizing perspective on the struggle and the city, as a discursive con- tribution of certain relevance" (171). Belli's protagonist, Lavinia, who works as an architect, represents the white, oligarchic, privileged social class. She falls in love with Felipe, another architect who works in the same office. He leads a double life, since he is also an activist in the Movement that opposes the repressive dictatorial regime. One evening, Felipe brings a wounded compaÃ±ero to Lavinia's house to escape capture, and her life starts to change radically. She is progressively drawn into the clandestine activities of the Move- ment. At the same time her architectural firm asks her to design General Vela's house so that her professional and revolutionary tasks converge. This dual position reflects her concerns expressed in an interview in 1984: "I think this revolution has made women grow in a direction for which quite possibly we were not yet prepared. Because I had a social status and</page><page sequence="7">THE INHABITED WOMAN 41 educational level not common in our country. So I'm not going to speak about the problem of women in general, but about professional women, working women, who aren't necessarily part of the elite, but who are the majority of women who work, who have gained a certain social conscious- ness of themselves both as women and as social beings. We have equal opportunities, and our opinions are taken into consideration. But this has made us live 'like men.' So this has left us with a great many unresolved aspects, still. The whole emotional part" {Risking a Somersault in the Air, 153). The oligarchic class aligns itself with modernism (high art, high cul- tural, elitist bias) which displays itself so ostentatiously in the first chapter. While Lavinia appreciates this style of architecture, she seeks to create another kind of architecture, more in line with her involvement in the revo- lution and the mestizaje "in a series of women who constitute the support and service sectors, the social cushion on which she leans" ( House/Gar- den/Nation, 1 77). The novel "argues in favor of a postmodernity - defined as constituting a revolutionary order and, therefore, one that goes beyond Modernity, understood as the renovation undertaken by the Central Ameri- can Common Market, and as a postmodernism drastically different from the postmodernism of developed countries - and of a development encom- passing an ample spectrum of the social body, from the oligarchic woman all the way to her subalterns" (178). Lavinia is "the woman in transition" (178) in the novel, and therefore the architecture she endeavors to create also finds itself in transition. This triadic relationship between architecture, urban setting and the novel has received sporadic critical attention. Alejo Carpentier provides some valuable insights into this area. He states that "the great difficulty of utilizing our cities as scenarios of novels lies in the fact that our cities do not have any style. Our cities, which are more or less extensive, more or less pleasant, are a hodgepodge, a buffoonish combination of good and detestable things, - horrible copies, sometimes, of European architectonic moments" ( Tientos , diferencias y otros ensayos, 12. Translation mine.). In the Vedado section of Havana, "all imaginable styles intermix: false Hel- lenic, false Romanesque, false Renaissance, false Loire chateaux, false modern style, without forgetting the great copies, due to the wave of pros- perity brought by the First World War, copies in their turn of other things - - of those which the Cornelius Vanderbilts, Richard Gambrill, Sanford White or Charles Sprague had built in the United States" (13. Translation mine.).</page><page sequence="8">42 HISPANIC JOURNAL Unlike European cities like Paris and Rome, which possess distinct archi- tectural phases, "Latin American cities have been in a process of symbio- sis, amalgams and transmutations for a long time, in the architectural as well as in the human domains. Our cities do not have any style. Neverthe- less, we are now starting to discover that they have what we could call a third style : the style of things which do not have a style. What happens is that the third style, for the same reason that it challenges everything that has been considered, up to a certain moment, as good and bad style, syn- onymous with good and bad taste , is usually ignored by those who con- template it each day, until a writer, a clever photographer begins to reveal [it]. Very few of our cities have been revealed up to now - unless one believes that a mere enumeration of exteriors, of appearances, constitutes the revelation of a city. It is difficult to reveal something which offers no preliminary information in books, a collection of sensations, contacts, epistolary expressions of admiration, images or personal perspectives" (13-14. Translation mine.) The Inhabited Woman represents a novel in transition from country to city, from modernist architecture to an adumbrated postmodern form, and Lavinia embodies these two ideas in her own transition: "The world would change. It would have to change, thinking about the faceless compaÃ±eros fighting in the mountains, the hope that lay within the sad- ness [Lavinia] felt. Somewhere in the city a group was preparing to carry out an 'assault,' some action not yet clear to her. She envied them for being together. Undoubtedly Felipe, Flor, and SebastiÃ¡n were part of the group. Everyone except her" ( The Inhabited Woman, 344). The novel searches for a third space, a social paradigm (one in which women will play an equal role in the revolutionary system), and a new architecture which combines the old and the new, the indigenous, the colonial and the postcolonial. This third space derives from superimposition in which "two familiar spaces are placed one on top of the other, as in a photographic double-exposure, creating through their tense and paradoxical coexistence a third space identifiable with neither of the original two ~ a zone" {Postmodernist Fiction, 46). Latin America constitutes a privileged thirdworldist postmodern space, in spite of the fact that it is questionable whether the continent ever passed through a modernist phase: "This dual- ism, Europe vs Latin America, runs right through Latin-American culture itself. The second mechanism hinges upon the conceptualization of Latin America not in terms of its external differences from Europe, but in terms</page><page sequence="9">THE INHABITED WOMAN 43 of its own internai differences, its inherent multiplicity. Objectively, Latin America is a mosaic of dissimilar and, on the face of it, incompatible cul- tures, languages, world-views, landscapes, ecological zones. Its condition is, we might even say, intrinsically postmodernist" (51-2). The third space which Lavinia seeks can be reformulated as "interfa- cial hybridity" (since Latin America gained independence in 1830 the postcolonial period has taken varied forms of camouflaged colonialism ranging from caudillos, dictators, economic exploitations, collusion, cor- ruption, and boom and bust economic cycles): Fanon's insistence upon the fundamental instability and consequent inventiveness of anti-colonial conditions is reworked by a variety of postcolonial theorists to produce the discourse of hybridity. Anti-colonial identities do not owe their origins to a pure and stable essence. Rather, they are produced in response to the contingencies of a traumatic and disruptive breach in history and culture. The grim polarities of the colonial encounter are necessarily bridged by a 'third-space' or communication, negotiation and, by implication, translation. It is in this indeterminate zone, or 'place of hybridity,' where anti-colonial politics first begins to articulate its agenda and where, in [Homi BhabhaÄ¼'s words, 'the construction of a political object that is new, neither the one nor the other , properly alienates our political expectations, and changes, as it must, the very forms of our recognition of the moment of politics. ( Postcolonial Theory , 130-1) Lavinia finds herself in a dual position of "inbetweenness" and "go-be- tweenness," that is, she belongs to the privileged social class that she re- jects and she gravitates towards the revolutionary group of which she does not feel a full-fledged member. What connects her to these two spaces is her hybridized architectural zone and her task is to design General Vela's house and to relay this information to the Movement so they can plan their assault more effectively. Since her role is not clearly defined until the end of the novel, the competing revolutionary and military discourses, the former centrifugal and expansive yet secretive and the latter, centripetal and secretive, place Lavinia in a highly precarious situation. The third discursive path for Lavinia is that of architecture that consists of a passage from modernist to an as yet ill-defined, hybridized postmodernist, revolutionary architecture. This third discourse enables Belli to explore the complexities of a society in transi- tion. Just as Alejo Carpentier envisages a third architectural style, Homi</page><page sequence="10">44 HISPANIC JOURNAL Bhabha formulates "the intervention of the Third Space of enunciation, which makes the structure of meaning and reference an ambivalent pro- cess, destroys this mirror of representation in which cultural knowledge is customarily revealed as an integrated, open, expanding code. Such an in- tervention quite properly challenges our sense of the historical identity of culture as a homogenizing, unifying force, authenticated by the originary Past, kept alive in the national tradition of the People" ( The Location of Culture, 37). He adds that "it is that Third Space, though unrepresentable in itself, which constitutes the discursive conditions of enunciation that ensure that the meaning and symbols of culture have no primordial unity of fixity; that even the same signs can be appropriated, translated, rehistoricized and read anew," (37). Ambivalence is a key term in Bhabha's theory, for it "disrupts the clear-cut authority of colonial domination be- cause it disturbs the simple relationship between colonizer and colonized. Ambivalence describes this fluctuating relationship between mimicry and mockery, and ambivalence that is fundamentally unsettling to colonial dominance" {Key Concepts in Post-Colonial Studies, 13). The attraction of ambivalence, hybridity and mimicry for Bhabha resides in their power to decenter the authorial discourse of the center, of modernism, so that "the marginal, the unclassifiable, the doubtful responds by constituting the centre as an equivocal, indefinite, indeterminate ambivalence" (14). In The Inhabited Woman Lavinia also finds herself in an ambivalent situation in terms of her work status at the architecture firm, her relation- ship with Felipe, with ItzÃ¡, and, more importantly, her role as an architect caught between the military mind-set of modernism and the postmodern mind-set of the Movement. She inhabits the space between mimicry and mockery, an interstitial zone where she can start to establish her architec- tural positionality. While Lavinia mimics the discourse of modernism when she observes the site of the new shopping center, when she deals with Mrs. Vela and her sister in planning the General's house, she also mocks the emptiness of this copy culture which thrives on the imported and deni- grates the autochthonous: "Mimicry is never very far from mockery, since it can appear to parody whatever it mimics. Mimicry therefore locates a crack in the certainty of colonial dominance, an uncertainty in its control of the behaviour of the colonized" (139). Homi Bhabha underscores the notion that hybridity "is not a third term that resolves the tension between two cultures, or the two scenes of the book, in a dialectical play of 'recog- nition. 'The displacement from symbol to sign creates a crisis for any con-</page><page sequence="11">THE INHABITED WOMAN 45 cept of authority based on a system of recognition: colonial specularity, doubly inscribed, does not produce a mirror where the self apprehends itself; it is always the split screen of the self and its doubling, the hybrid" (The Location of Culture, 113-4). Lavinia and ItzÃ¡ represent the split screen of self, modernism and postmodernism that of architecture, the military and the revolutionaries, that of the sociopolitical sphere. Notwithstanding the metaphoric resonances of architecture in the novel, Lavinia is an architect who designs (but does not oversee the con- struction of) General Vela's new house, lives in a cityscape overlaid with many architectural styles and who occupies (inhabits) and moves among a variety of fictional spaces in the novel. The fictional cityscape of Faguas (which may be Managua) contains a mixture of architectural styles which clash with the natural surroundings: "Faguas stimulated her pores, her de- sire to live. Faguas as sensuality. A body open, ample, sinuous; wild breasts of women, made of earth, spread across the landscape. Threatening. Beau- tiful. She rested her head on the window, intensely observing the streets. What Faguas needed was life, she thought. That's why she dreamt of con- structing buildings, leaving her mark, giving warmth and harmony to the concrete, replacing the stunted imitations of New York skyscrapers on Truman Avenue... with designs that were in harmony with the landscape. The city was trying at all costs to become modern, using any outlandish method possible" ( The Inhabited Woman, 14). This passage describes what has transpired in many Latin American cities from the time of the Con- quest: Successive architectural styles have converted them into a hodge- podge of disjunctive constructions embodying the tastes, fantasies and dreams of the colonial imagination. In Faguas the architectural dominant is the single-coded modernism: "Modem society was above all a single-coded society, and Modern Archi- tecture was an unreadable architecture, an architecture of steel, glass, and concrete that valued convenience and functionality only, an architecture from which no narrative could be read" ( http://www.kisho.co.jp/Bookslbook/ chapterl2.html, 2-3). While Faguas's architecture embodies the culture of the copy, its surroundings teem with natural beauty and organic disorder, all of which the modern buildings endeavor to stifle in the name of func- tionality. Lavinia's Aunt InÃ©s, who becomes one of her foremothers, in- stilled in her the "right to be [an architect], to build in real-life-size houses she invented in the garden, the carefully constructed models made of matchsticks and old shoe boxes, the magical cities" (The Inhabited Woman,</page><page sequence="12">46 HISPANIC JOURNAL 11). Modernity also extends to the elevators that in Faguas symbolize power and wealth: "From the street you could see the escalator, the only one in the country and a great novelty. The store had to post doormen by the entrance to keep out the ragged little newspaper vendors because in the first few days they had made the elegant ladies who were being electroni- cally transported to buyers' heaven feel uncomfortable." (14). Lavinia's ideas about architecture clash with the single-coded, func- tional, abstract and dehumanized nature of modem architecture and corre- spond more closely to Carpentieri third style and some of the tenets of postmodern architecture, especially pluralism, double-coding, and the fo- cus on meaning and communication.2 When Lavinia enters the lobby of the building where she will work, she immediately notes its single-coded nature: "The building was modern, a rectangular matchbox-style with gray walls and red trim. It had an elevator. A status symbol. Another artifice to convey modernity. There were only five or six elevators in all of Faguas. They were there to impress, sometimes in a building with only two floors, where only the top executives used them. At least here there were four floors. The elevator went to the elegant offices of doctors, engineers, law- yers, and architects" ( 1 5). As Lavinia waits for her interview "in the stark modem reception area," she looks at a magazine which contains "houses it was nearly impossible to imagine human beings living in. They looked as if they were made for angels, heavenly dwellers far removed from such basic needs as resting their feet on the coffee table, smoking a cigarette, or eating peanuts" (15). The elevator simply elevates people to a higher sym- bolic status, and the sharp-angled, colorless (gray) texture of this modern building proves unreadable and devoid of human content. Her interview with JuliÃ¡n Solera reveals the surfaciality of the ar- chitecture that the firm performs: "It wasn't like Europe, he told her. La- dies came in with their clippings and ordered designs from House and Garden and House Beautiful. They would fall in love with a mountain hideaway in the Alps and decide to apply the design to a summer home on the beach" (16). After her conversation with Solera, she is invited into his office: "The office was modern. Leather chairs. On the walls abstract draw- ings framed in aluminum. A floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the lake. Volcanoes grazing. Enormous mammals" (16). Belli employs internal, fixed ocularization to reveal the conflictive nature of modern architecture in Lavinia who envisages a radically different kind double-coded architec- ture. She wants to create architecture in which the dialogicity of human</page><page sequence="13">THE INHABITED WOMAN 47 voices communicates, and in which human beings find a communal, social space. Finally, when Lavinia is alone in her cubicle, "she sat down at the drafting table. She spun around several times in the swivel chair, enjoying the feeling of being an 'architect' for the first time. It was hot outside. Haze vibrating above the asphalt. The haze would climb to the heavens to form immense towering clouds at dusk. Magenta and orange cumulonimbi that would travel across the sky before the light disappeared, erasing her first day at work' (19). The haze and heat form part of the natural landscape of this country in which modern architecture is out of place, given its angles, straight lines and coldness. When Lavinia examines the blueprints of the shopping center, she instinctively rejects linearity and begins to draw circles, "allowing her impulses to guide her" (19). Lavinia responds to the pulsat- ing rhythms of the natural setting surrounding Faguas; indeed, throughout the novel Lavinia constantly endeavors to replace the "solitarity" of mod- ern architecture with the solidarity of the resurrected social, communal space of postmodern architecture. Architectural Encounters of the Modernist Kind Felipe asks Lavinia to inspect the site of a new shopping center, and as she approaches it, she "saw the foundations of countless houses all made according to a single model" (25). Lavinia does not oversee the construc- tion of the shopping center, and she must endure the harassment of the male construction workers: "It ought to be illegal, Lavinia thought, the harassment women encounter in the streets" (25). When Lavinia examines the blueprints, she "couldn't find the site where the shopping complex was to go up. Only when she went over them again did she realize that the sketch pointed clearly to the other side of the street. She looked up and saw again the row of cardboard and wood slab dwellings. Barrios like that oc- cupied the periphery of the city and occasionally they were able to infil- trate the more central areas" (25). This may be Felipe's way of introducing Lavinia to the realities of progress in the hands of dictators and military governments who tradition- ally denigrate their own cultures in favor of imported ones. This barrio, with its structures made of the bits and pieces of building materials, "looked peaceful. It was the peacefulness of poverty. There were naked children, children in short pants filling buckets of water from a common faucet, and</page><page sequence="14">48 HISPANIC JOURNAL barefoot women hanging clothes made of thin, worn cloth along wires. According to the blueprints, the comer of the shopping center would hy- pothetically crush the vulcanizing shop. An ice cream parlor would re- place it. The walls of the new construction would cut through the small gardens of banana and almond bushes. And the people? More than once she had read in the newspaper about people being evicted from their houses. She never thought that she would have to be a party to it" (25-6). Lavinia thus takes the first step toward double-coded architecture by crossing the road to talk with people living there: "They asked me to check the blue- prints. I didn't know about this situation" (28). Her first encounter with the realities of modern architecture and progress leaves her angry and help- less: "Lavinia felt pity and discomfort. It wasn't the most pleasant way to get to know 'the practice,' she thought, sensing that she was part of the destructive apparatus that would force these eternal gypsies to migrate once more. Why hadn't Felipe warned her? she wondered, heading for the avenue in the middle of the suffocating heat and the wind that sent dust scurrying" (28). The Postmodern TÃ¼rn: Towards the Third Style and Space Lavinia's architectonic parameters begin with a room of her own within a single-coded Spanish colonial house which is then inhabited/ hibited by Felipe who seems to mark out the boundaries of this room, so that instead of her place and her space, it becomes his place, her space. The other space is, of course, the patio in which the union between ItzÃ¡ and Lavinia takes place, and Lavinia thus taps into a much broader spa- tiotemporal dimension. Her space changes and expands as she becomes more involved with the Movement and follows the path of the warrior. She will form a more tripartite "palimpsestuous" relationship with ItzÃ¡ (past, present and future) in the sense that beneath the new Lavinia-text the ItzÃ¡-text will remain visible and indivisible, and the future Lavinia/ ItzÃ¡-text, although incomplete at the end of the novel, nevertheless an- nounces itself to the reader. The architectonic patterns will also exhibit this palimpsestuous relationship, changing in accordance with Lavinia's development. Lavinia is moving toward Carpentieri third style, which is a style of things that have no style. Lavinia will progressively reveal the architectonic patterns that combine the past and present and announce the future contained in the novel:</page><page sequence="15">THE INHABITED WOMAN 49 The three space-times of the novel can be synthesized in the following manner: 1 . the time- space of the indigenous past in which ItzÃ¡ fought against Spanish imperialism and whose boundaries expand into the present; 2. the time-space of the present, mestizo and in transition toward an uncertain future; and 3. the future time-space which is associated with two conflicting ideologies: the first prefigured by the foreign space of the US, a representation of the type of future which threatens to invade the present world of Faguas, and the second prefigured by the more positive - but also uncertain ~ future of the Indo-Sandinista utopia for which Lavinia struggles. The three space-times are in turn linked to three different myths: the past to the Maya; the present to the Sandinistas; and the future, either to that of Yankee imperialism or to that of the Sandinista utopia. ("Gioconda Belli, novelista revolucionaria," 232. Translation mine)3 The reconfiguration of Lavinia's architectonic space proceeds from the inside out, and accelerates after ItzÃ¡ inhabits her: "Lavinia contains great spaces of silence. Her mind has wide regions which are dormant. I submerged myself in her present and could feel visions from her past. Cof- fee bushes, smoking volcanoes, gushing springs, wrapped in the thick fog of nostalgia. She is trying to understand herself. This fountain of echoes and visions is complex. I cannot find any order in the succession of images that emanate from these soft white surfaces. They disconcert and over- whelm me. I must rest. My spirit is uneasy" ( The Inhabited Woman, 58). Lavinia then wraps herself in the cocoon of her house until Felipe bursts in to shatter her tranquility. Her internal room is still developing, but her house is no longer safe for her. Her internal architectonic space is demanding release into the public space: "She wished it were already the following day. Then she could watch them leave her house. Be alone, at ease, again. Forget what had happened. But she was ashamed to have Felipe see she wanted him to leave with his wounded friend" (69). Until now, her contact with the Movement was a fantasy: The 'guerilla fighters' were something distant for her, like beings from another planet. In Italy, like everyone else, she had admired Che Guevara. She remembered her grandfather's fascina- tion with Fidel Castro and the lrevolution'"(71). The allusion to Che Guevara proves crucial to understanding the role of architecture in the evolution of guerilla warfare following Che's death in Bolivia in 1967. Like many of the young people inspired by Che Guevara's absolute devotion to permanent revolution and action-oriented leadership, Lavinia resembled more an armchair revolutionary than an ac-</page><page sequence="16">50 HISPANIC JOURNAL tive participant. Che's campesino-centered revolution in the countryside, chronicled in his Bolivian diary, exposed the soft underbelly of this type of revolution. Che and his compaÃ±eros, relentlessly pursued by the Boliv- ian army, plagued with constant shortages of food, weapons, money and massive communication problems, were most likely doomed from the outset. After Che's death, guerilla warfare relocated to the urban centers where everything was in more plentiful supply. The urban landscape be- came the staging center for much better equipped guerillas who still re- tained the idea of the focos revolucionarios, or revolutionary cells, which operated independently of one another. This structure prevented the mili- tary from striking one fatal blow to the guerilla movements. Urban guerilla warfare inhabits cityscapes characteristic of Carpentieri third style. These cities are overlaid with architectonic strata from different eras, but the one trait they share is that they are imported styles emanating from colonizer cultures. Faguas's present architecture embodies the single-codicity of modernism, expressing the vertical power structure of the military and dictatorial regime whose message is meant to be transparent, while the leaders remain invisible. Latin American cities also contain elements of the pre-modemist and modernist eras, a hodge- podge of styles that end up being no style. If, as Carpentier affirms, Latin American cities are waiting to be revealed, their very nature converts them into hybridized architectonic spaces much closer to postmodernist archi- tecture: "This is an architecture that mixes and hybridizes opposing ele- ments such as historical styles with contemporary life, and high art with popular culture. Modern architecture scorned Las Vegas as the vulgar taste of the masses and ranked it very low. Modem architecture, like modem literature and abstract art, made no attempt to hide its elite consciousness. In contrast, Postmodern architecture has set itself to the task of destroying the border separating high art and popular art" ( http://www.kisho.co.jp/ Bookslbooklchapterl2.html, 3). This aspect of postmodern architecture coincides with another: "Ur- bane urbanism: a sympathetic weave of the old and the new, of different functions and different styles in urban planning, as opposed to the rational grid, destruction of the past and differentiation of functions in modem town planning" ( http:llwww-phil.philengl.dundee.ac.uk/staff/ jrw, postmodernism! postlec2.htm, 1). One of the problems of leftist gue- rilla movements has been their tendency to be long on destruction of the existing order and short on concrete proposals to replace the existing</page><page sequence="17">THE INHABITED WOMAN 5 1 sociopolitical paradigms. The Utopian urges of the guerillas in The Inhab- ited Woman, adumbrations of a "new order," come up a little short in the bifurcating path of the future in the novel. As some critics have asserted, Latin America is a postmodern space avant la lettre , and its cities would also seem to fall into the same category, since they are products of archi- tectural hybridization. Belli stresses the internal architectonic realignment of Lavinia who transforms herself into a warrior like ItzÃ¡, and this process continues throughout the novel. Belli further underscores the continuity of the revolutionary struggle, the interweaving of the old and new, so that the indigenous past reaches into the present and announces the future. Lavinia's envisions architecture as double-coded, as if it could offer some kind of epistemological redemption since the third style still has not been revealed. The hybridity of Latin American architecture and culture opens the door to multivalence in which the ossified monuments of the past can counterbal- ance the Western tendency to treat the indigenous past as a collection of relics with no meaning in the present. Lavinia finds herself in a more postmodernist architectural mode in the sense that it "responds to the mul- tiplicity of the city. Postmodern architecture must be created based on a reading of the plurality of the city's values and its complex content" (htttp:/ /www.kisho.co.jp/Books/book/chapter 1 2.html, 4). Architectural Mimicry, Mockery, and Meaning Lavinia's rearchitecturalization places her in direct conflict with the proponents of the dehumanized, modernist architecture. She is becoming double-coded and is experiencing internal architectonic changes as her new identity emerges: "She wondered if she weren't turning into another per- son, if she weren't slowly ceasing to be what she had been. The days of carefree living seemed so distant now. Obviously she was changing. The problem was she didn't know which direction the changes were taking. For now, she had to get used to being three persons. One for her friends and her job, another for the Movement, a third for Felipe. At times she was afraid of not knowing which of these three persons she really was" ( The Inhab- ited Woman, 158-9). Unlike the routine designs she makes for the firm's rich clients, she does not yet possess a blueprint for herself. Her boss JuliÃ¡n assigns her the task of convincing two rich women "not to import garish fabrics and carpets from Miami or insist on 'Swiss chalets' for a tropical climate" (159). These two women turn out to be General Vela's wife and her sister, and they constitute parodies of modernist architecture: "They</page><page sequence="18">52 HISPANIC JOURNAL had slender, lifeless hands which they extended with affectation. All their bracelets couldn't hide their lack of social grace" (160). These women have no taste, and all they know is the trendy, lifeless styles of imported culture. They live in a bibelot culture which only places value on the ac- quisition of material things, or, the "thingification" of their lives. With their total disregard and rejection of natural and indigenous elements, they state that the General wants a house built on a very difficult spot: "'I can't imagine how a house can be built there, but my husband says it's possible" (160). Mrs. Vela wants "a big house, with plenty of room," and "'General Vela likes a social life'" (160-1). They "need several drawing rooms, din- ing rooms, and extra bedrooms. . .and a swimming pool for the children, a play area ... Plus my husband would like a place to shoot pool" (161). This house constitutes an architectural parody/pastiche composed of alien ma- terials: "[The sisters] weren't long in opening their purses and taking out clippings from magazines, mentioning their desire to have 'imported' ma- terials, since Faguas couldn't supply the styles that would satisfy their requirements. Lavinia leaned over the table to look at the sisters' clip- pings. At least it was Raquel Welch's summer home and not Ursula Andress's Alpine cottage" (161). The Vela's house parodies the preten- tiously elitist shibboleths of high modern architecture while it metaparodies itself, transforming itself into a succession of parodies, a procession of self-consuming simulacra. Finally, the General's house surpasses parodie limits to become a pastiche: "Pastiche is, like parody, the imitation of a peculiar or unique, idiosyncratic style, the wearing of a linguistic mask, speech in a dead language. But it is a neutral practice of such mimicry, without any of parody's ulterior motives, amputated of the satiric impulse. Pastiche is thus blank parody, a statue with blind eyeballs" ( Postmodernism , 1 8). Lavinia's task will also entail imbuing this house with architectural meaning and the center of this drama will be the General's secret armory. Later, when she learns from Felipe that he wants her to accept the assignment in order to gain more information about General Vela and the military, she at first objects until a meeting with two other revolutionaries, Flor and SebastiÃ¡n, convinces her to carry out the task. Several days later, "at the office, Lavinia struggled against depression and weariness while she was sketching possible options for the Vela house. She felt that her life was becoming uncontrollably tangled. Her two parallel existences crashed into each other, shaking her, threatening to erase every vestige of her iden-</page><page sequence="19">THE INHABITED WOMAN 53 tity" (The Inhabited Woman, 179). Lavinia's first meeting with General Vela takes place at a transitional residence where the Velas' consuming passions and bad taste produce a heterogeneous combination of faux everything. The Vela residence "was as she had imagined it: a mixture of styles, each more gaudy than the other, disparate and ostentatious: mirrors with convoluted gilt frames, matching tables against the walls, heavy furniture with bright damask covers, chrome chairs and tables, enormous urns, rugs of odd pastel colors, reproductions of landscapes on the walls, paintings of gigantic, artificial seascapes" (255). Lavinia lives in the culture of the copy, and the Velas are forever seeking redemption in imported architectural styles, many of which come from Miami. Nevertheless, this meeting is crucial to the new role that Lavinia will play: "Beginning with the design and the construction of the house, her professional dexterity, together with the daily routine of a high-ranking army official, will be recognized. That is how, in the construction of the house, the two agendas mentioned above are fulfilled: the professionalization and bureaucratization of woman and her participation in the construction of a new nation-state" ( House! Garden/Nation , 185). General Vela dominates the conversation until Lavinia reveals her plans for his personal armory: She noticed the man's fascination when she explained the fanciful idea of the armory's revolving wall. It would have three wood panels, each one with steel rods in the center, supported on individual revolving pivots mounted on a metal track. A mechanism set into the wall would allow them to be locked shut or released so they could turn. On one side the panels would display the weapons collection, mounted on the surface; on the other, the panels would simply be a mahogany wall with lovely grain. This way the General could, as he wished, display one side or the other, just by releasing or locking the panel's mechanism. The rotation area required for this trick would also provide the General with space behind the wall, a sort of 4 secret chamber' where he could store additional weapons or cleaning equipment. (261) The secret chamber appeals to General Vela's egocentric personality and mania for secrecy and security (indeed, his name in Spanish embodies exactly what he is and does since velar means to keep a vigil, to mask or veil, to watch over). In the secrecy of his armory he can play with his phallic arms or display them on the wall. General Vela, like the secret cham- ber, can be successively transparent and opaque, since his power, like a</page><page sequence="20">54 HISPANIC JOURNAL rhizome, spreads to all facets of people's lives. Lavinia then meets with the other revolutionaries, and SebastsiÃ¡n remarks to her: "Lavinia, you have to learn that in this matter it's not up to you to make the plans, only the blueprints" (269). SebastiÃ¡n is, of course, referring to the secret plans of the group, and the blueprints refer only to the architectural aspect. For Lavinia, who is becoming a warrior, her blue- prints are performative, a revolutionary act in themselves. Placed in the architectural context, the significance of the Vela house becomes clearer. For General Vela, the house constitutes a unique architectural object, the embodiment of his power-driven yet fragile ego. In his mind, the architec- tural status of this unique object remains inimitable, unchanging and solid. No possibility exists of transcending the unique physical object unless it enters the allographic regime of architecture which deals with ideal ob- jects: "There is nothing surprising about the fact that a human activity should produce a singular material object by transforming already exist- ing materials. What is surprising, and does call for an explanation, is rather the fact than an artistic practice should produce the ideal objects that allographic works immanate in, and also, perhaps even more surprisingly, the 'identical' material objects that multiple autogrpahic works immanate in" (The Work of Art, 44). Lavinia concentrates on the ideal object of the allographic regime, so the Vela house constitutes much more than a unique physical object. The Allographic Axis of Architecture and Revolution Lavinia must maintain her modernist faÃ§ade and continue to work on General Vela's unique object. When Lavinia journeys to a secret site to train in guerilla fighting, she encounters another unique physical object: the hacienda which embodies the seigniorial order. In this new social or- der, Lavinia's first architectural discovery involves a weapon: "Lavinia had been impressed by the delicate internal architecture, the application of physics to ballistics, the carefully synchronized mechanisms. It was the first time she had seen up close one of those objects that horrified her mother so much" ( The Inhabited Woman, 272). After lunch, while Lavinia is resting from her military training, she scrutinizes the architectural fea- tures of the hacienda: Through the windows, a pale afternoon light illuminated the thick- walled enclosure. It was cool inside the high-ceilinged house. Lavinia was familiar</page><page sequence="21">THE INHABITED WOMAN 55 with the typically Spanish construction. The thick walls kept out the heat. The high ceilings allowed the stifling air to rise above their heads, leaving a cool comfortable space. In the colonial houses of cities, the homes closed in around themselves, opening only to an interior of patios and corridors. The hacienda house, conceived for country life, was designed with a different concept: the interior space was only for sleeping; the veranda facing the fields was where the daily activities took place, and where in times past, the masters and their ladies would sit swaying in fancy rocking chairs in the afternoons, observing the plantation. (278) As Ileana RodrÃ­guez observes: "The construction of the house operates as a metaphor for the construction of the nation and for the historical contri- bution of women to the history of their social, national, and provincial environment" ( House/GardenlNation , 183). This colonial space first ap- pears when Itza awakens in the patio of Lavinia's house (8). In the countryside, the interior part of the house was intended only for sleeping while the exterior part, the veranda, was the center of activi- ties and, more importantly, the ideal position for casting the Western colo- nial gaze upon all these "exotic" lands. This specular existence converted the colonial culture into a poseur, bibelot culture which never tired of gaz- ing at the "objects of colonial desire" which included the indigenous popu- lation: "As we can see, the shift not only from new to old, but also from the functions originally assigned to the structure, the edifice, from those who served the colonial society - bypassing the questions of plantations, labor, and service constructed as landscape ~ to the future army that would use it as a warehouse, demarcates the borders between the archaic and the mod- ern" (184). Later, when Lavinia goes to see General Vela at his military head- quarters, she enters the quintessential modernist realm: They passed two more check point barriers until they came to a group of concrete buildings. On a smaller scale, they had the same heavy, monumental architecture of the structures in Mussolini's modern Rome: plain gray walls with geometric bulk, rectangular proportions. Going up the wide marble stairs, [Lavinia and the General's secretary] reached another, larger vestibule onto which several offices opened, each one protected by a guard in full regalia. In the middle, the waiting room with its leather furniture was marred by the adornment of plastic flowers on the tables. General Vela's office offered the same mixture of bad taste and solid, cold architecture. The focal point was a colored photograph hanging on the wall - the Great General smiling a toothy grin from ear to ear. Taken from a lower angle, the</page><page sequence="22">56 HISPANIC JOURNAL photograph tried to invest the small man with the majestic air he lacked. The rest of the furnishings, made of vinyl and steel, were supposed to be modem. The ashtrays and the shell and snail decorations gave the room a touch of kitsch. Above the filing cabinets the secretary had a collection of matchboxes in an enormous crystal goblet. (294). The portraits of the Great General and General Vela are most likely those which are ubiquitously displayed throughout the country, portraits of younger, more physically fit men who never seem to age. In this man- ner, the dictator and his cronies appear invisible, omnipotent and omni- present to the public. The architectural aspects of the military base and General Vela's office underscore the military power and the rigid, vertical command structure of this patriarchal institution, while the military base's ostentatious, monumental architecture occupies the public space. The geo- metric bulk and rectangular proportions of the buildings and vinyl and chrome furnishings serve as objective correlatives of the linear, abstract and single-codicity of the military regime. When Lavinia meets General Vela, he is "standing behind his solid wood desk, surrounded by photo- graphs of the Great General hugging him, pinning a medal on him, fishing with him, in a helicopter, on horseback" (295). Lavinia's visit with Gen- eral Vela closely coincides with the modernist architecture and design of the military base since the visit is made within the hierarchized, vertical power structure. A little later, Lavinia visits the site of the Vela house where "the tractors and bulldozers moved around, excavating and flattening the earth" (302). In this strictly male domain she meets Don Romano, the foreman in charge of the construction crew. Just as she is about to leave, Don Romano says: "'You know, I had a daughter who wanted to be an architect. But instead she got married and died in childbirth. . .The fact is, I never thought it was right for her to study that sort of thing, but when I see you...'" (304). This site will become the focal point of struggle for two visions of the future. Vela's house represents of pinnacle of political power and re- pression and Lavinia, having discovered Vela's weak point (which is, ironi- cally, the armory), she has pierced the "armor" of power which surrounds the military regime. Later, when she eats dinner with Adrian and Sara, coffee is served in the study: "It was a small, inviting room, lovingly arranged by Sara, of course. Adrian's diploma and engineering certificates occupied one of the walls. On the others, there were framed illustrations of old blueprints used</page><page sequence="23">THE INHABITED WOMAN 57 by the Spaniards during the colonial period to construct cities" (314). The old, framed blueprints for the Spanish colonial buildings in Adrian's house constitute part of the monochromatic, static official history of the country, and their value as a historical source remains monoreferential (or denotational) and carry no other message than that of vertical power. Lavinia's conception of architecture rejects this superior/inferior, linear, single-coded architecture and she often finds herself drawing circles. For her, blueprints are palimpsestuous texts which serve as the convergence point between the plans and the building. Her blueprints serve as hypotexts with which she can interact and transform continuously to produce hypertexts. General Vela house will be double-coded since it represents life, death, rebirth, freedom and a vision of the future. Architecture is not only something Lavinia plans but which she also executes and carries out, and this doing is embodied in the revolutionaries' attack on the Vela house. Lavinia becomes a member of the assault force because of Felipe's unex- pected death, and it will be her blueprints for the Vela house, and espe- cially the armory, which constitute the real revolutionary plan. Towards the end of the novel, Lavinia says, thinking about Felipe's death: "Felipe's death was the price she had to pay. Felipe had had to die to give her his place. Women would enter history out of necessity" (390). In an interview with Margaret Randall, Gioconda Belli talks about the gender blurring that takes place when women joined the revolutionary ranks: "The ordinary man sees her as an 'equal' and therefore not as a woman. Because his idea of a woman is not yet that of an 'equal. A woman for most men here is still someone who is submissive, who stays home, who behaves in a completely traditional way. So a woman who has freed herself in this way may have excellent men friends, close relationships, compaÃ±eros who tell her their troubles, who confide in her, and who share many things with her, but never occurs to think of her as a possible companion. They can't deal with it" ( Risking a Somersault in the Air, 153-4). Because of (or perhaps in spite of) Felipe's death, Lavinia is sud- denly thrust into a new role which demands that she find a third way which mediates the masculine/feminine binarism. The path she chooses is that of berdachism: "Briefly, a bardache can be defined as a morphological male who does not fill a society's standard man's role, who has a nonmasculine character" ( The Spirit and the Flesh, 2). Berdachism "is a way for society to recognize and assimilate some atypical individuals without imposing a change on them or stigmatizing them as deviant. This cultural institution</page><page sequence="24">58 HISPANIC JOURNAL confirms their legitimacy for what they are" (3). Lavinia, like many Na- tive American, seeks "options not in terms of either/or, opposite catego- ries, but in terms of various degrees along a continuum between mascu- line and feminine" (http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/99-l Iissue5l spirit. html, 2). The sign of Lavinia's architecture is the circle: "Within aboriginal communities there's a movement away from defining things according to a linear spectrum or a continuum. A model a lot of people can relate to is the circle, because the circle is a very important symbol both spiritually and culturally. There's an infinite number of points along a circle - there's no one way to be, and no one end or beginning" (2-3). Lavinia may enter history out of necessity, but she will determine where that entry point will be. If her architecture is one that has no style (neither modem nor postmodern), and her space is interstitial and interfacial, a space between two others, then her new identity must also be ternary (a third gender). She can no longer function according to the Western heterosexist binarism of masculine/feminine. While ItzÃ¡ may catalyze Lavinia's internal rearchitecturalization, Lavinia not only moves through several phases ranging from modern to postmodern architecture, but also fuses the blueprints and the plan of the assault, and then executes it. In other words, Lavinia passes from imma- nence (plans/designs, the unique physical object) to imminence (the ideal object) and, finally, to eminence (the merging of the third style, pace and way). This final change, which begins as a result of Felipe's death, could reflect Belli 's stance on the unrealized Sandinista idea(l) of women enjoy- ing equal status as warriors within the revolution. Her blueprints are pal- impsests that reach back to the indigenous past, unfold in the present, and announce the future. ItzÃ¡'s words merge the different ternary skeins: "She has not fought with spears. She has battled with her own heart to the point of exhaustion until she has seen her inner landscape shaken by hundreds of volcanoes, until she has seen new rivers, lakes and softly sketched cit- ies emerge. I, quiet inhabitant of her body, see her constructing the solid foundations of her own existence. Now she stands and advances irrevoca- bly toward the place where blood will find its respite" ( The Inhabited Woman, 325). This proleptic hinting points to the moment when all the triadic skeins shall meet and merge, and culminate in the external and internal rearchitecturalization. Lavinia returns one last time to view her creation: [She] "stood in front of the construction site. General Vela's house was finished... The</page><page sequence="25">THE INHABITED WOMAN 59 finished house occupied 9000 square meters, distributed among four lev- els, in the style of the Babylonian terraces, with picture windows on the three upper floors" (335). Lavinia cannot suppress a passing moment of self-indulgent immanence as she ponders the house: "In spite of the own- ers' bad taste, the house was a lovely piece of architecture. It seemed to be suspended in space, nestled in the abrupt incline of the terrain. Its spacious interior was light, and each room flowed into the next" (335-6). She ad- mires it as an immanent unique physical object that cannot be transcended, but this moment quickly passes as she remembers the Vela sisters' consum- ing passions: "The ostentatious dÃ©cor was the only thing that bothered Lavinia. It had been impossible to get Mrs. Vela to agree to allow local carpenters to build the furniture. Only the numerous built-in items had been made locally; the living room, bedroom, and dining room furniture, the rugs, curtains, and accessories, that is, all the rest, had been brought in from Miami. The two sisters had spent the last two months traveling con- stantly, fascinated by the Florida department stores, shipping by air flow- ery cushions, crystal chandeliers, bronze urns and planters, oddly textured bedspreads, rattan chairs, plastic stools, and pool umbrellas" (336). Even the grass comes from Miami where they sell it "as if it were a carpet" (337). For their big Christmas party to christen the new house, Mrs. Vela has special invitations, "a Hallmark card with the picture of a house emerg- ing from a gift box and carefully inscribed inside in Miss Monte's angular writing" (338). The house embodies the specular fascination of this bibelot culture whose static gaze focuses on an endless series of material acquisi- tions which epitomize their emptiness. While Lavinia can momentarily admire the unique physical object which she has created, she fully realizes that the interior is the real site of the impending power struggle: "Only the gigantic master bedroom, the private study, the children's and the sister-in-law's bedrooms had been placed in the interior of the house, for fear of thieves and assassination attempts" (335). The construction of the house parallels Lavinia's interior/exterior struggle and the armory will become the focal point of the third style, space and way: As she entered the armory, she felt strangely uneasy. During the construction of the house, she had tried to forget the room that had so pleased Vela. It was medium-sized, with orange rugs and a single window with brown curtains that looked out on one of the inner patios. Two leather sofas with a wooden table were set against the wall. On the floor she saw several</page><page sequence="26">60 HISPANIC JOURNAL unopened wooden boxes. They probably contained the weapons that were to be displayed. At first glance, the room seemed to end at the wooden wall across from sofas - a wall formed by the three mahogany panels with beautiful grain. She went over to the end of the wall where the nearly invisible mechanism that released the panels was set. She released them and gently pushed one of the panels. The wood panel turned on its axis, revealing the small inner space, the secret chamber with shelves built-in at the center. Before turning the last panel, she remained for a moment in the small 'secret' room. She felt cold. The place stored the air-conditioning as if it were a refrigerator. (339-40) After the revolutionaries gain entrance to the house, Lavinia catches sight of the boy who "seemed determined to make her look at him, notice him" (403). When she realizes that General Vela is hiding in the secret chamber, she enters to confront him and herself and the moment of total merging is about to take place in the architectural space that she has de- signed and which has been transformed into her internal architectural space. ItzÃ¡ and Lavinia speak as one voice: "I did not doubt. I hurled myself through her blood, madly riding the horses of that eternal instant. I screamed from every corner of her body, howled like a wind sweeping away that second of hesitation, tightening her fingers, my fingers, over that metal that vomited fire" (409). Past, present and future merge at this crucial moment, and ItzÃ¡ and Lavinia meld into one as she confronts Vela: "She knew then that she had to close the last stroke of her contradictions, take sides once and for all. She moved quickly, placing herself in front of the strong, stocky man aiming at her and pressed her fingers - stiff and hard - on the trigger" (410). Lavinia sacrifices her life for a possible rearchitecturalization of the future, and her journey from immanence, im- minence to eminence is finally completed. The role of architecture in The Inhabited Woman functions on sev- eral interrelated levels, and Lavinia constitutes the site of the struggle to achieve an architectonic unity which reaches back to the indigenous past, unfolds in the present, and announces the future. The first level involves Lavinia's struggle to enter a male-dominated profession in which she can leave her mark, gain the respect of her male colleagues, and simply per- form as well as men. Notwithstanding the advantage of her social class, she bathes in the attention and accomplishments of being the only woman architect in the firm. Felipe, her adversary and lover and mentor in some ways, links Lavinia to the second level of architecture constituted by the guerrilla opposition in which she becomes increasingly enmeshed. This</page><page sequence="27">THE INHABITED WOMAN 61 second level leads her to the task of designing General Vela's house and the armory. While she struggles in one direction at the story level, another architectonic struggle takes place on a third level as ItzÃ¡, the indigenous warrior, who returns in the form of an orange tree, progressively inhabits Lavinia and initiates the (de)(re)construction of Lavinia's internal rearchitecturalization. Lavinia "fights" this battle, but she will have to cease fighting everyone and everything in the end. The changes set in motion by ItzÃ¡ are inevitable and eventually pervade every part of her life. ItzÃ¡'s voice, transtemporal and transhistorical, is part of the system of Lavinia's foremothers (along with her aunt InÃ©s), and ItzÃ¡'s voice not only contests official history but chronicles the different stages of Lavinia's internal changes. Lavinia occupies different private and public spaces which also par- allel her transformation. First, she has a room/house of her own, inherited from aunt InÃ©s. The patio becomes a privileged space in which Lavinia and ItzÃ¡ meet. Lavinia next occupies a public space in the firm of architects where she struggles for "equality in the work place." The next space is the shopping center that also relates to work issues. The Vela house, and the armory with its secret room, which she designs, become the focal point where all the architectural skeins merge at the end of the novel. This space is transformed into the mythical, spiritual and mental space in which Lavinia achieves identity on all levels, and where she becomes a warrior. She also gives birth to a new vision that is constantly adumbrated in the novel, a Utopian vision that Belli leaves open for the reader to decide. Lavinia's creation of a unique physical object of immanence in the Vela house (which she momentarily admires) proves entirely inadequate, and she must con- tinue her journey from immanence, to imminence (manifestation) and fi- nally to eminence (transcendence) when she confronts General Vela in the secret chamber. This final transformation gives birth to a vision which is contained in the elegiac ending of the novel: "I have completed my cycle: my destiny of germinated seed, the design of my ancestors. Lavinia is earth and humus now. Her spirit dances in the afternoon wind. Her body fertil- izes the rich fields" (411). Architecture represents the vehicle which car- ries the multilevel epistemological and ontological drama of Lavinia whose internal and external architecture meet and merge to form the vision of this rich novel.

El tiempo-espacio del pasado indÃ­gena en el que ItzÃ¡ luchÃ³ contra el imperialismo espaÃ±ol y que extiende sus redes de continuidad sobre el presente; 2. el tiempo-espacio actual, mestizo y en transiciÃ³n hacia un futuro incierto; y 3. El tiempo-espacio futuro que se asocia a dos ideologÃ­as en conflicto: la prefigurada por el espacio extranjero de USA, representaciÃ³n del tipo de futuro que amenaza invadir el mundo presente de Faguas, y la prefigurada por el mÃ¡s positivo - pero tambiÃ©n incierto - futuro de la utopÃ­a indo-sandinista por la que lucha Lavinia. Los tres espacio- tiempos se asocian a su vez a tres mitos diferentes: el pasado, al maya; el presente, al sandinista; y el futuro, bien al del imperialismo yanqui o bien al de la utopÃ­a sandinista.
