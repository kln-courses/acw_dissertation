<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES When Mickey Mouse Is as Strong as Superman: The Convergence of Intellectual Property Laws to Protect Fictional Literary and Pictorial Characters Michael Todd Helfand* From Bart to Batman to Bugs to Bond ... James Bond, the creative and financial value of fictional literary and pictorial characters has skyrocketed at a dizzying pace. Courts have merged, in an unprecedented fashion, the different intellectual property laws that protect against unauthorized use of these characters. At one time courts had fairly stringent requirements for extending such protection, and clear boundaries separated the different causes of action. In the 1970s, however, a transition began that resulted in convergence-the phenomenon where courts view copyright, trademark, and unfair competition claims as though they are coequal and necessarily interrelated. Courts have replaced the great uncertainty previously facing character owners with an equally problematic, overly protective doctrine for fictional characters. The distinctions between, and goals of, intellectual property laws that have existed in other contexts have become nonexistent when applied to fictional characters. As a result, the role of public domain doctrine1 is uncertain. This note begins with an exploration of the nature of fictional characters generally, and how their unauthorized use can result in a judgment of in- fringement. The foundation of case law protecting-or refusing to protect- characters is reviewed. After discussing the nature of fictional characters and the basic case law, the note discusses the convergence phenomenon and its problems. The stage thus set, the note analyzes recent case law concern- * J.D., Stanford Law School, 1991.

This analysis reveals a gradual breakdown of the delineation between intellectual property causes of action and their conver- gence into an almost singular, albeit poorly defined, approach. The note then discusses the long-term problems presented by this convergence. Fi- nally, the note posits an approach that recognizes both the validity of pro- tecting characters through various intellectual property laws and the necessity of keeping these actions doctrinally and functionally separate. I. THE UNIQUE POSITION OF FICTIONAL CHARACTERS Stories may come and go, but characters remain to be used anew. While moder fictional characters have existed for decades, in the last several years their creative and financial value has skyrocketed. Character owners have responded by pressing a wider range of intellectual property causes of action to shield their creations. Aggressive protection is spurred on by the near human quality inherent in these "beings." Together with the ability of fic- tional characters to serve simultaneous expressive and indicative functions, the foundation for convergence uniquely arises in this context. A. Tremendous Public Acclaim Many commentators have expressed views as to what constitutes a pro- tectable fictional character.2 The definition offered by Leon Kellman is representative: A fictional character consists of one or more of three elements: 1. It can be an idea-a general concept. 2. It can be the "expression" or detailed development of an idea-a "per- son" created textually (by verbal description and/or by storytelling that goes beyond "description"), visually (by two-dimensional art, e.g., a draw- ing or three-dimensional art, e.g., a statue or doll; .. .), or even by a living portrayal .... 3. It can be a name. The first category, the idea, is basic and ever-present.3 For years, fictional characters have entertained the public while bringing substantial financial reward to their creators. One need only look to the longevity and financial success of characters such as Mickey Mouse (over 61 2. See, e.g., E. Fulton Brylawski, Protection of Characters-Sam Spade Revisited, 22 BULL.

Comic books, long thought of as little more than "silly pic- tures,"5 have undergone a creative renaissance. "Recently, the avant garde art press has been full of praise for the sophisticated graphics, and countless newspaper and magazine articles have cited the topicality of today's comic- book plot lines as a sign of the art form's maturity."6 The changes in the comic book industry are driven as much by consumers as by creative forces. An industry publication notes "[i]n 1989 the [comic book] reader/collector continued to be more discriminating in his/her buying practices. The mar- ketplace is more demanding than ever and sub-standard art, writing, pricing, packaging are no longer tolerated. This trend appears to be the force behind the Darwinian processes shaping this evolving marketplace."7 Consumers are more likely to connect owners and creators with the use of their characters as the characters step out of their fictional worlds. For example, in recent years fictional characters have been used to promote so- cial causes.8 However, because they become "personalities" unto themselves, 4.

OVERSTREET, THE OFFICIAL OVERSTREET COMIC BOOK PRICE GUIDE 1990- 1991, at A-28 (20th ed. 1990). Consumer involvement is an important consideration in the character protection arena, particu- larly because trademark and unfair competition analyses focus on the effect an infringing mark has on consumer confusion as to source or sponsorship. Thus, the sophistication and discriminating buying habits of the market are critical when confusion is alleged. See notes 66-75 infra and accom- panying text. The market's growing responsiveness to consumers suggests that purchasers truly care about the product they receive and very likely come to expect certain continuous writing, artistic, and perhaps moral qualities in the products. 8.

This ulti- mately feeds the growth of convergence and the misapplication of the rele- vant laws in general. Licensing fictional characters and selling products featuring these char- acters generates billions of dollars a year. For example, the 1990 movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, based on characters first appearing in a 1984 comic book, grossed approximately $25.4 million in its first weekend at the box office, while licensing of the characters brought in $175 million in 1988 and $350 million in 1989.9 The 1989 movie Batman, based on Bob Kane's 1940s "Dark Knight" crime fighter, grossed over $251 million in 1989,10 and its spin-offs have sold more than $500 million.11 The characters from Fox Television's prime time animated comedy series The Simpsons, premiering in 1989, were worth millions within months of the series's introduction.'2 B. Motivated and Sophisticated Owners As with any valuable commodity, those in a position to profit from char- acter exploitation are eager to preserve control over the character's commer- cial use.13 To this end, owners and creators seek to wrap their fictional characters in a net of invulnerability-a net created through an artful inter- day morning" characters have also become more socially aware.

The riches to be collected from exploiting American entertainment phenomena-the likes of the Disney characters, the Flintstones, Dick Tracy and rock groups-play a not inconsequential role in the nation's balance of trade. For the ideas and products of Ameri- can dream factories continue to rule world pop culture-an estimated 90 percent of li- censed goods are based on licenses originating in the United States-and are likely to do so for years to come.

By way of a rough analogy, one need only look at the extensive litigation engaged in by major software producers both to clarify, and to logically extend, the scope of copyright protection that would be granted to software once it was found eligible for copyright under the 1976 Copyright Act.</page><page sequence="5">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS weaving of copyright, trademark, and unfair competition laws. The exten- sive number of claims brought for character infringement during the past decade substantiates this claim.14 Led by a small handful of major character owners, the battle for greater protection has taken the lead role away from legislators and courts.15 This allows plaintiffs-and these powerful owners in particular-to achieve a convergence of intellectual property claims. In this battle, the top generals include Walt Disney, Warner Brothers, DC Comics, and Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. Their leadership exists not because of the number of lawsuits they bring, but because of the role their cases have played in establishing convergence.16 Even when these parties lose, the judi- cial opinions produced often further entrench convergence in judicial think- ing.'7 And by threatening litigation, these major character owners prevent other character infringement cases from going to court. Unfortunately, these cases might ultimately serve as a forum to reevaluate convergence. The stronger a trademark a character becomes, the less interest the owner has in tolerating uses that copyright alone otherwise allows. Charac- ter owners have a great incentive to oversee any and all character-related uses once their character becomes an indicator of source, as untoward uses may damage the goodwill of the owner.18 Without such oversight, the char- acter loses its legal ability to be a mark. While a given use may be so "outra- geous" that few would think that the owner sanctioned it, businesses are unlikely to tolerate even some customers making the mistaken attribution. Finally, when a character takes on a near human life of its own,19 char- acter owners are far less willing to endure unauthorized uses that, if dealing with other subject matter, would be considered noninfringing fair uses. Cre- ators and owners often identify so closely with their characters, intermin- gling their own personalities with those of their creations, that they become 14. See generally texts accompanying notes 101, 137-163 infra. 15. If character owners were facing continued defeats in the courts, it could be expected that they would lobby for specific recognition of characters in the Copyright Act, as exists in some other countries. However, convergence appears to have taken the place of calls for legislation specifically articulating character rights. But see David B. Feldman, Finding a Home for Fictional Characters: A Proposal for Change in Copyright Protection, 78 CAL. L. REV. 687 (1990). 16.

By way of example, think of how young children often believe that fictional characters are living, breathing beings. 627</page><page sequence="6">STANFORD LAW REVIEW quasi-parents. In such a role, the creators seek to safeguard their "chil- dren's" wellbeing.20 Owners and creators seek greater legal protection in part to insure that no one harms the character by putting it in unflattering or disharmonious situations. For example, Walt Disney Company does not permit its licensees to "depict Mickey Mouse in an unattractive manner, such as drinking liquor."21 Imagine the indignation of an owner whose character is used in a pornographic "parody,"22 even when the public does not believe that the owner authorized the use. While economic and market- ing concerns also motivate owners, improper uses have effects on the charac- ter and on the public, young and old alike. These concerns are never far from the owner's mind. C. Simultaneous Expressive and Indicative Functions The characteristics of characters single them out as the sole fertile ground for converging intellectual property theories. Literary and pictorial characters function uniquely as expressive works and indicators of source simultaneously. While noncharacter artwork may function as both in a lim- ited fashion, it lacks a critical element: the ability to take on a life of its own. "Unlike most paintings, photographs or novelty items, a character can take on a life of its own and thus may be protected against copies in postures, settings and attitudes far removed from any in the author's original depic- tion."23 The interplay of the following factors invites convergence to occur in the fictional character arena: (1) the great economic potential from con- tinued use of characters which take on a life of their own; (2) recognition by the Lanham Act that characters and their names can function as marks;24 (3) the ability to protect characters in completely new postures, settings, and attitudes-that is, extending the expressive content that arises at creation to subsequent works; (4) the unique quality of entertainment products that leads characters within a work to suggest, if not clearly indicate, origin; and, (5) the anthropomorphic quality that characters develop with continued use which leads us to relate to them as human. There can be no doubt that the characters themselves influence court decisions. This may be especially true of characters born 30 or more years ago because they have earned great 20.

No one wanted their character to be smoking a marijuana cigarette. Or they would say, 'My Bugs Bunny would never say that.' The writers had the toughest job in all of this."

Members of juries and those on the bench may adopt a paternalistic attitude toward characters, evidenced by a predis- position to side with plaintiffs in character protection cases as well as a will- ingness to blur the boundaries between intellectual property theories if necessary to achieve the desired and "just" result. This unique environment has produced a significant body of case law incorporating ideas and argu- ments from copyright, trademark, and unfair competition law in ways never before seen. II. THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF FICTIONAL CHARACTERS AS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Early fictional character cases recognized the distinct scope and limited protection available under copyright and trademark, respectively. Because courts treated copyright and trademark analysis distinctly rather than eclec- tically, they found themselves extending copyright protection to literary characters only infrequently. Similarly, not every unauthorized use of a markedly similar character guaranteed that an infringement action would succeed. A. Copyright 1. Strong but limited duration protection. The 1976 Copyright Act provides authors with exclusive rights to reproduce their works, to produce derivative works, and to publicly perform or publicly display their works.25 Works subject to copyright protection are defined by the 1976 Act to include literary works, dramatic works, pictorial and graphic works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works.26 How- ever, as to works within these categories, "(i)n no case does copyright pro- tection . . . extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work."27 This is known as the idea/expression dichotomy. The duration of copyright for works created on or after January 1, 1978, is the author's life plus 50 years.28 Works created under the 1909 Act are protected for 28 years, plus a renewal term of 28 years.29 Once the term of protection ends, a copyrighted work falls into the public domain, and the exclusive rights of the owner are lost.30 Perhaps the most important limitation on the exclusive rights of owners of copyrighted works is the doctrine of fair use. Copyrighted works may be 25. 17 U.S.C. ? 106 (1988). 26. Id. ? 102(a). 27. Id. ? 102(b). 28. Id. ? 302. 29. 17 U.S.C. ? 24 (1976). 30. The concept of "public domain" . . . is sometimes used to describe material that is unprotectable because it falls outside a particular law's constitutional or statutory subject 629</page><page sequence="8">630 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 copied without infringing the copyright "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching .. ., scholarship, or research."31 Most likely, fair use of a character will be asserted for a parody.32 Among the most difficult problems of applying copyright analysis to fic- tional characters is how to extend protection to a character that has taken on a life of its own, existing outside the context of any particular work.33 Cen- tral to the resolution of this problem are the copyright doctrines of the idea/ matter.... Or the term may describe subject matter that, having once enjoyed the law's protection, is now free for all to use because the statutory term has expired. [C]onsider that subject matter is in the public domain not because some brooding omnipresence has declared it to be there, but only because a court or legislature has deter- mined that it should be there. Ideas, for example, are free as air not because they are naturally fugitive, but because Congress, state legislatures and courts have decided that they should go unprotected. PAUL GOLDSTEIN, COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK AND RELATED STATE DOCTRINES 7-8 (2d ed. 1981). 31. 17 U.S.C. ? 107 (1988) (Courts are to consider four factors: (1) purpose and character of use; (2) nature of the copyrighted work; (3) amount and substantiality of portion used in relation to the work as a whole; and (4) effect upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.). 32. Common law limits how much a parody may take from a copyrighted work and still qual- ify for the fair use exception. Benny v. Loew's, Inc., 239 F.2d 532 (9th Cir. 1956), aff'd, Columbia Broadcasting Sys. v. Loew's, Inc., 356 U.S. 43 (1958), first stated that the parody is subject to the same "substantial similarity" test as any alleged infringing work. Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 822, found that parody may borrow the amount necessary to "recall or conjure up" the original work. The rule was subsequently broadened some- what by Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1980), which stated that more extensive use is fair use if the parody builds on the original, using it as an element of modem culture. Finally, Fisher v. Dees, 794 F.2d 432 (9th Cir. 1986), said that parody will qualify for fair use where it does not fulfill the demand for the original. 33. "[C]opyright law [prevents] re-use by one other than the owner of the copyright, at least to the extent of those attributes of the character which distinguish it from others of its general type and make it a unique figure in the public mind." Note, The Protection Afforded Literary And Cartoon Characters Through Trademark, Unfair Competition, And Copyright, 68 HARV. L. REV. 349, 363 (1954). One should contrast this with the issue of extending protection against the unauthorized taking of a work in which the character appears. This is more properly handled as infringement of the work as a whole, rather than components of the work. Subsequent creative works incorporating characters from earlier works are the means by which the value of these characters is realized. Thus, both the motivation and the risk of infringement center on providing new work. In recognition of this fact, neither the 1909 Copyright Act nor the 1976 Copyright Act restricts protection to the expression of the character in a given work. Under the 1909 Copyright Act, in force until January 1, 1978, a fictional character could arguably achieve copyright protection under ? 3, which states: "The copyright provided by this title shall protect all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted, and all matter therein in which copy- right is already subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright." 17 U.S.C. ? 3 (1976); see also Warner Bros. Pictures v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 102 F. Supp. 141 (S.D. Cal. 1951), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 216 F.2d 945 (9th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 971 (extending protection to characters if they are the "story being told"). While the 1976 Act did away with reference to the separately copyrightable components, it did not limit copyright protection to the character's expression in a given work. Graphically depicted characters qualify separately under ? 102(a)'s inclusion of "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" in the list of protectable works of authorship. For literary characters, just as other expressive aspects of a literary work, the Register of Copyrights has stated: "As is equally true in the case of detailed presentation of plot, setting, or dramatic action, we believe it would be unnecessary and misleading to specify fictional characters as a separate class of copyrightable works." 1 MELVILLE B. NIMMER &amp; DAVID NIMMER, NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT ? 2.12, at 2-171 n.2 (1990) (quoting Register's Supplementary Report).</page><page sequence="9">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS 631 expression dichotomy and fair use. The idea/expression dichotomy has proven troubling for the protection of fictional characters in literature, and may well compromise protection of characters with developed personalities. In deciding whether copyright law will even protect the allegedly infringed character, courts often ask whether a character is sufficiently developed to qualify as protectable expression, rather than mere idea.34 Determining whether a character is "sufficiently delineated" to be eligible for copyright protection involves, in effect, assessing the character's "inherent worth."35 This has the unfortunate effect of diverting attention from the extent to which the alleged infringing work has copied that character.36 The true test for infringement is the degree of similarity between the al- legedly infringing character and the original work.37 Analysis of similarity is relatively easy for visually depicted characters because a factfinder can recognize the original character in the infringing work, even if the characters are in different poses. Likewise, a court can analyze literary characters in the same way.38 2. Separating protectable expression from unprotectable ideas-the foundation cases. More than one commentator has noted the irony that literary characters, often considered creatively and intellectually superior to "mere cartoons," have less protection.39 Judge Learned Hand set the stage for this counterin- 34. See Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930), cert. denied, 282 U.S. 902 (1931); Warner Bros. Pictures v. American Broadcasting Co., 720 F.2d 231, 240 (2d Cir. 1983). 35.

But see Ideal Toy Corp. v. Kenner Products Div. of General Mills Fun Group, 443 F. Supp. 291, 302 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) ("[T]he proper focus in such a case lies not on the quality of the original characters but on establishing whether the allegedly infringing characters can be said to be 'copied' from the original."). Once copying has been found, it is appropriate to review the value of the character to the complete original work. Even if the character is a quantitatively small part of the whole work, it may be so integral that any copying of it is tantamount to copying the whole work. Under such circumstances, copying could not be characterized as "fair use." See Harper &amp; Row Publishers v.

One commentator states that: Fully realized characters in literature are little different from fully defined personali- ties in daily life, and it is no surprise that the test of protectibility that courts apply [or should be applying] to literary characters is closely akin to the criterion that individuals apply in daily life to determine whether they in truth know someone. A literary character can be said to have a distinctive personality, and thus to be protectible, when it has been delineated to the point at which its behavior is relatively predictable so that, when placed in a new plot situation, it will react in ways that are at once distinctive and unsurprising. 1 P.

Universal Pictures Corp.40-the case that set the tenor of restrictive protection for literary characters for years to come. The Nichols court noted that copyright protection "cannot be limited literally to the text, else a plagiarist would escape by immaterial varia- tions."41 Although Judge Hand specifically recognized that the characters and sequence of events constituted the substance of the work, and thus were protectable, he nevertheless noted the limited nature of such protection. Finding plots may be infringed, Judge Hand reasoned: Nor need we hold that the same may not be true as to the characters, quite independently of the "plot" proper, though, as far as we know, such a case has never arisen. If Twelfth Night were copyrighted, it is quite possible that a second comer might so closely imitate Sir Toby Belch or Malvolio as to infringe, but it would not be enough that for one of his characters he cast a riotous knight who kept wassail to the discomfort of the household, or a vain and foppish steward who became amorous of his mistress. These would be no more than Shakespeare's "ideas" in the play .... It follows that the less developed the characters, the less they can be copyrighted; that is the pen- alty an author must bear for making them too indistinctly.42 Subsequent cases interpreted this passage as establishing the "well-developed character" test to determine copyrightability.43 In truth, this passage is sim- ply a test of infringement.44 The next major case created an even more restrictive,45 if not insur- mountable, requirement that the character constitute the "story being told." In Warner Bros. Pictures v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys.,46 the "Sam Spade" 40. 45 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1930), cert. denied, 282 U.S. 902 (1931).

L.J. 341, 346 (1982) ("The extent of the author's right to claim the character as a property is proportionate to the specificity of its development in the work.").

In other words, the more detail with which a character is described, the greater chance that it will, standing apart from the story proper, be afforded a copyright in its own right. It is important at this point to note how the improper interpretation affected future rulings. Most notable is the difficulty fictional characters subsequently had in receiving copyright protection despite the fact that Hand's opinion did not say such protection could never be found.

[Vol. 44:623 632</page><page sequence="11">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS 633 case, the question before the court was whether author Dashiell Hammett transferred the rights to his characters when he granted Warner Brothers the exclusive motion picture and allied rights to his book "The Maltese Fal- con."47 The court ruled for CBS on contract grounds because the parties did not intend Warner to have exclusive rights to the characters.48 The majority further reasoned that Hammett retained sequel rights because characters were not copyrightable, and hence excluded from the grant of rights.49 Spe- cifically, the majority found: "It is conceivable that the character really con- stitutes the story being told, but if the character is only the chessman in the game of telling the story he is not within the area of the protection afforded by the copyright."50 The court found Sam Spade to be merely a chessman- part of the vehicle for telling the story.51 In finding that Sam Spade was a mere chessman, the court overlooked the obvious: it was the detective, not "[a] story of a chase or a jewelled statuette" that was of interest to the public.52 The court seems to say that he was only a "typical protagonist."53 Under such a view, it is difficult to imag- ine a court ever finding a character to be "the story being told."54 In contrast to the plight of literary characters, pictorial characters had a far easier time receiving protection against unauthorized use because of their physical embodiment.55 This protection was available despite the fact that mere character sketches may contain little protectable expression.56 The early extension of copyright protection to unauthorized, non-cartoon uses of cartoon characters demonstrates the greater ease with which these character owners could obtain protection. For example, in Hill v. Whalen &amp; Martell, 47. The key issue, which the court avoided, is "whether the aggregate of copyrightable ele- ments in a literary work includes rights to the use of its characters, such that a general transfer of one's rights in a work conveys an exclusive right to the use of that character." Davidow, supra note 35, at 542. 48. The court finessed the key legal question by finding the "intention of the parties, inclusive of the 'Assignment,' was not that Hammett should be deprived of using the [Maltese] Falcon charac- ters in subsequently written stories, and that the contract, properly construed, does not deprive Hammett of their use." Warner Bros., 216 F.2d at 950. 49. The court reasoned: "The characters of an author's imagination and the art of his descrip- tive talent, like a painter's or like a person with his penmanship, are always limited and always fall into limited patterns."

One commentator has suggested that at the heart of the restrictiveness of this ruling is the court's narrow view of the purpose of the copyright statute. It sees copyright "as designed, not to prohibit one person's use of another's property, but to restrain 'palming off' or plagiarism-to pre- clude, in other words, a near-verbatim replication of the work as a whole." Id. at 543 (footnote omitted). 55. See id. While protection of literary characters usually requires that their behavior be "pre- dictable" so as to enable their recognition, such has not been the case for cartoons. Thus, cartoons faced an easier time of attaining protection. This is especially so because visual renditions of charac- ters qualify as artistic works, and hence attain copyright protection on this basis alone. 56. If the character consists of nothing other than "a few lines and colors, [it] will often lie close to the public domain elements, including stereotyped attributes, on which [it] dr[e]w," and hence be extended only very limited copyright protection. 1 P. GOLDSTEIN, supra note 23, ? 2.11.3, at 160.</page><page sequence="12">634 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 Inc.,57 defendant produced a stage production entitled "In Cartoonland" that featured the main characters "Nutt" and "Giff," apparent carbon cop- ies of plaintiff's characters "Mutt" and "Jeff." The court found the produc- tion infringed the plaintiff's cartoon, believing that the stage characters Nutt and Giff "were 'Mutt' and 'Jeff.' Everybody so understood, and it was in- tended that everybody should so understand."58 When competing comic book characters first clashed, it appeared that they were on their way to expansive protection. Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications,59 adjudicated two years after the first appearance of the "quintessential hero with extraordinary powers,"60 found that the exploits of defendant's "Wonderman" infringed those of plaintiff's "Superman." The real dilemma the court faced was how to prevent the plaintiff from mono- polizing the general attributes of a super-powered being61 while precluding plagiarism of the unique "expression" in plaintiff's cartoons. Plaintiff's ex- pression admittedly went beyond the general stereotype of a "benevolent Hercules,"62 at least as portrayed within the specific exploits in its comic books. Noting the similarities and differences between the two super- heroes,63 the court found that defendant violated Detective Comics' copy- rights. It held: We think it plain that the defendants have used more than general types and ideas and have appropriated the pictorial and literary details embodied in the complainant's copyrights.... So far as the pictorial representations and verbal descriptions of "Super- man" are not a mere delineation of a benevolent Hercules, but embody an arrangement of incidents and literary expressions original with the author, they are proper subjects of copyright and susceptible of infringement .... 64 57. 220 F. 359 (S.D.N.Y. 1914); see also King Features Syndicate v. Fleischer, 299 F. 533, 535 (2d Cir. 1924) (finding "Spark Plug" doll to be a copy of the cartoon horse if, with "ordinary obser- vation," it was recognized as taken from, or reproducing, the cartoon); Fleischer Studios v. Ralph A. Freundlich, Inc., 73 F.2d 276, 278 (2d Cir. 1934), cert. denied, 294 U.S. 717 (1935) (finding infringe- ment where doll is "recognizable by ordinary observer as having been taken from" the copyrighted cartoon "Betty Boop"). 58. 220 F. at 359. While the language of this passage arguably stands for the proposition that "Mutt" and "Jeff" were sufficiently developed to be recognized outside the cartoon medium, it could just as easily be used to find a violation of the unfair competition laws through "passing off" or creating confusion as to source or authorization. The defendant's use of similar names supports this view. See Gruelle v. Molly-'Es Doll Outfitters, 94 F.2d 172, 176 (3d. Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 304 U.S. 561 (1938) (refusing to restrain the defendant from selling "deceptively similar dolls" absent a claim of copyright infringement, while restraining the use of the names Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy); see also Zissu, supra note 2, at 124 ("[Cases] dealing with named cartoon characters or dolls have generally allowed remedies for copyright infringement where copyright subsists or for unfair competition where it does not."). 59. 111 F.2d 432 (2d Cir. 1940). 60.

It seems from this language, and the strict remedy, that the court found not only infringement of the character "Superman"-his "distinctive pictorial elements"-but also of</page><page sequence="13">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS 635 However, a later court restricted this holding, interpreting it to protect only "the specific exploits of 'Superman,' as each picture portrayed them."65 Thus, although cartoon characters received protection with greater ease than their literary brethren, early case law nevertheless established fairly strict requirements for copyright protection, in toto, of fictional characters, guar- anteeing their creators few intellectual property rights, or chances to enforce them. B. Trademark, Unfair Competition, and Dilution 1. Weak but potentially perpetual protection. Trademarks and service marks perform four main functions:66 (1) "to identify one seller's goods and distinguish them from goods sold by others";67 (2) "to signify that all goods bearing the trademark come from a single, albeit anonymous, source";68 (3) "to signify that all goods bearing the trademark are of an equal level of quality";69 and (4) "[to serve] as a prime plot-the "arrangement of incidents." See Marks, supra note 44, at 50; Note, supra note 33, at 358. However, the court failed to recognize that many situations in which "super beings" carry out their feats are also mere delineations, or stereotypical. In the absence of plot copying, the remedy in Detective Comics could prevent the use of the defendant's character in situations where the similari- ties would not rise to the level of infringement. See Marks, supra note 44, at 50. 65. National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications, 191 F.2d 594, 600 (2d Cir. 1951), opinion clarified, 198 F.2d 927 (2d Cir. 1952). This later holding restricted protection for cartoon characters if placed in new exploits. 66. 1 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION ? 3:1, at 104 (2d ed. 1984 &amp; Supp. 1988); see also Note, supra note 33, at 363 ("Trademark and unfair competition will provide relief against the use of a character's name, and ... in certain cases, [are] applied so as to protect the [owner or] author from use by another of the character itself."). The Lanham Act defines a trademark to include "any word, name, symbol, or device, .. . [used] to identify and distinguish ... goods." Lanham Act ? 45, 15 U.S.C. ? 1127 (1988); 1 J.T. MCCAR- THY, supra, ? 3:1, at 103. This definition applies equally to common law and federal law marks. The analyses of trademark infringement under federal and common law causes of action are virtually identical. The main difference is that registration of a mark on the Principal Register under federal trademark law provides constructive notice of the mark's existence and ownership throughout the United States. The Lanham Act further provides that a service mark may include "[t]itles, character names, and other distinctive features of radio or television programs ...." Lanham Act ? 45, 15 U.S.C. ? 1127 (1988). Words and phrases that, standing alone, are ineligible for copyright protec- tion may thus be protected if they meet the trademark requirements. One important function of a trademark is to reduce search costs for consumers, embodying such information as the reputation of producers or brands of goods. Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 18, at 270. The "purpose of protecting identifying features is not to provide manufacturers with the incen- tive to develop those features," but to invest "in goodwill." Lee B. Burgunder, Trademark and Copyright: How Intimate Should the Close Association Become?, 29 SANTA CLARA L. REV. 89, 95 (1989). Unfortunately for the trademark owner, it costs very little to usurp this investment by sim- ply imitating the mark. Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 18, at 270. 67. 1 J.T. MCCARTHY, supra note 66, ? 3:1, at 104. 68. Id. Source applies not only to the manufacturing source, but also to the source of the standards of quality. See, e.g., In re Abcor Dev. Corp., 588 F.2d 811 (C.C.P.A. 1978). 69. 1 J.T. MCCARTHY, supra note 66, ? 3:1, at 104-05. While there is no requirement that the goods or services be of high quality, trademark functions as a "kind of 'warranty' to purchasers that they will receive, when they purchase goods bearing the mark, goods of the same character and source, anonymous as it may be, as other goods previously purchased bearing the mark." Revlon, Inc. v. La Maur, Inc., 157 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 602, 605 (T.T.A.B. 1968). It is imperative that the licensor/owner maintains quality control over the goods and services that reach the customer under the mark. See, e.g., Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart's Food Stores, 267 F.2d</page><page sequence="14">636 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 instrument in advertising and selling goods."70 While a fictional character cannot be trademarked for its own protection alone,71 it may function as a trademark when used to indicate the source of a product.72 Trademark laws, both common law and federal, protect against a second comer's use of the same mark, or a "colorable imitation" of a mark, where it is likely to cause consumer confusion, mistake, or deception.73 Proof of con- sumer confusion is the most crucial element of a trademark infringement cause of action. Courts employ a "likelihood of confusion test," balancing a number of factors to determine if consumers are confused or misled by a 358 (2d Cir. 1959); Principe v. McDonald's Corp., 631 F.2d 303 (4th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 970 (1981). "The benefits of trademarks in reducing consumer search costs require that the producer of a trademarked good maintain a consistent quality over time and across consumers." Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 18, at 269. In the character protection arena, this requirement is accentuated by the extensive marketing and merchandising of well-known characters, presenting a greater risk that the "character as mark" will fail to represent consistent quality. See Stevenson, supra note 12, at D 18: [S]ome marketing experts say that the expansion of the [Disney retail] stores suggests that Disney is in danger of over-licensing its characters and overexposing its name, sacrificing their image and their value in the long run to make a little more money in the short run. Moreover, they say, a venture like a restaurant [located within the stores] carries the risk of staining the Disney name every time the french fries are soggy or the hamburger is dried. Id.; see also Kleinfield, supra note 11, at C6. With regard to the characters from the animated series The Simpsons, "Fox said it is being careful to exercise control of what marketers can make. 'We want to limit the merchandise to make it witty when possible so that it's not just an image slapped on the side of a plastic piece of junk,' Mr. Groening said." Id. Such concerns can be seen overlapping with copyright considerations in instances when owners place their characters in new creative works. See Karlak, supra note 20, at 5-6. However, it is questionable whether the "quality" of the story in which a character appears is the same "quality" that trademarks come to represent. 70. 1 J.T. MCCARTHY, supra note 66, ? 3:1, at 104-05. 71. Ex parte Carter Publications, 92 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 251 (Comm. Pat. 1952) (character not trademarkable, per se); In re Circus Foods, Inc., 252 F.2d 310 (C.C.P.A. 1958) (registration denied for failure of "Nutsy the Clown" to indicate product or origin). The strict approach followed in Carter does not appear to be the current rule, although there is no clear evidence that characters can be trademarked in and of themselves. This would seem to be sound because otherwise a character that does not indicate source would be protected under trademark regardless, and thus avoid an unwavering requirement for protection. See Peter Shapiro, The Validity of Registered Trademarks for Titles and Characters After the Expiration of Copyright on the Underlying Work, 31 COPYRIGHT L. SYMP. (ASCAP) 69, 88-89 (1984). 72. For example, the "Poppin' Fresh Doughboy" signifies the involvement of the Pillsbury Company. See generally Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Prods., 8 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981). Likewise, the words "Coca-Cola" in script on a product denote the authorization of, if not actual manufacture by, the Coca-Cola Company. The ability to register a character's visual depiction as a mark was recognized as early as 1930. Jantzen Knitting Mills v. Spokane Knitting Mills, Inc., 44 F.2d 656 (E.D. Wash. 1930) (mark in question was the figure of a girl diving). Izod's alligator and Ralph Lauren's polo player are clear examples of characters as marks. A character name can function as a trademark in a number of ways. First, used as the title of a book, movie, or an ongoing literary or audiovisual series, it indicates the source of that particular entertainment good or service. See Warner Bros. Pictures v. Majestic Pictures Corp., 70 F.2d 310 (2d Cir. 1934) (extending trademark protection to a title). Second, used as the character's name, it denotes the source of the character itself as an entertainment product or service and the goodwill that has built up in it. See, e.g., Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. v. Manns Theatres, 195 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 159 (C.D. Cal. 1976); Gruelle v. Molly-'Es Doll Outfitters, Inc., 94 F.2d 172 (3d Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 304 U.S. 561 (1938). Third, it may be used on goods or services not employing the character, but for which the trademark owner nevertheless wants the source known. 73. Lanham Act ? 32, 15 U.S.C. ? 1114 (1988).</page><page sequence="15">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS 637 second comer's use of an allegedly infringing mark.74 The correlative analy- sis is whether the original mark has acquired secondary meaning75 such that consumers will wrongfully associate the second mark with the first. The duration of trademark protection is potentially perpetual. Provided the mark is not abandoned or otherwise loses its indicative qualities,76 the owners rights continue in perpetuity.77 This reflects the understanding that trademarks benefit not only their owners, but consumers who rely on identi- fication of the sponsoring or producing business entity. Unfair competition, a common law cause of action, is a "thread of the same cloth" as trademark;78 the difference is one of degree rather than of kind. It embraces a broad continuum of competitive conduct likely to confuse con- sumers as to source of goods and services-from the appropriation of rela- tively nondistinctive symbols accompanied by acts of passing off, to the appropriation of distinctive symbols in which case confusion is presumed. Trademark law occupies only the last part of this continuum . . .79 74. Anthony F. Lo Cicero, Litigating Trademark Cases, in PRACTISING LAW INSTITUTE, LIT- IGATING COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CASES 1989, at 81, 101 (1989). Although there is general disagreement among the circuits as to exactly what factors determine consumer confusion, the following are most often cited: (1) strength of the owner's mark; (2) simi- larity between marks; (3) proximity of the products upon which the marks are placed; (4) likelihood that the owner will produce products, if not already doing so, similar to those of the alleged in- fringer; (5) methods of marketing the products; (6) alleged infringer's good faith in adopting the mark; (7) the quality of alleged infringer's products; and (8) sophistication of the consumers. See ANTHONY L. FLETCHER &amp; ROBERT M. KUNSTADT, 1988-89 TRADEMARK LAW HANDBOOK ? 7.01, at 131-38 (1989). A finding of actual evidence of or a high likelihood of confusion will result in a judgment for the senior user of the mark. 75. Secondary meaning is premised upon the psychological effect of trade and service marks on purchasers. "The prime element of secondary meaning is a mental association in buyers' minds between the alleged mark and a single source of the product. It is the crucial word 'association' which appears most often in judicial observations on secondary meaning." 1 J.T. MCCARTHY, supra note 66, ? 15:2, at 659 (citations omitted); see Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 434 F.2d 794, 802 (9th Cir. 1970); Levi Strauss &amp; Co. v. Blue Bell, Inc., 632 F.2d 817 (9th Cir. 1980). The main thrust of secondary meaning is that the purchaser comes to rely on the mark as an indica- tor that the good or service comes from a single source, whether that source is known or anonymous. See In re Polar Music Int'l AB, 714 F.2d 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1983). A plaintiff is not always required to show secondary meaning when a mark is inherently distinc- tive. See A.J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman, 808 F.2d 291 (3rd Cir. 1986); Fuddruckers, Inc. v. Doc's B.R.Others, Inc., 826 F.2d 837 (9th Cir. 1987). 76. If the mark becomes generic, or merely descriptive, it loses its status as a trademark. See King-Seeley Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Indus, 321 F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1963); Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., 272 F. 505 (S.D.N.Y. 1921). 77. For federally registered marks, registration may be renewed for periods of ten years. Lan- ham Act ? 9, 15 U.S.C. ? 1059 (1988). 78. This analogy is credited to legal scholar and practitioner Paul Geller. 79. P. GOLDSTEIN, supra note 30, at 90-91. Unlike trademark law's focus on "each discrete element in the plaintiff's marketing image," "[u]nfair competition law is entirely circumstantial. In determining whether a defendant's conduct is unfair, courts will look at the aggregate effect of all the elements employed in the plaintiff's and defendant's respective marketing efforts." Id. at 91. For a review of the traditional elements of an unfair competition case, see American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Mfg. Co., 103 F. 281 (6th Cir. 1900). Note, however, that ? 43(a) of the Lanham Act "effectively reverses the rule of American Washboard as a matter of federal law." P. GOLDSTEIN, supra note 30, at 91. Even though unfair competition is a distinct cause of action, confusion as to source again plays a major role, and the court's analysis of likelihood of confusion under unfair competition parallels that found in trademark cases.</page><page sequence="16">638 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 Lanham Act ? 43(a) appears to codify unfair competition on the federal level,80 specifically prohibiting false and misleading designations, descrip- tions, or representations likely to cause confusion or mistake as to source or association.81 Given the similarity of ? 43(a) to trademark infringement doc- trine, courts applying the former also follow a likelihood of confusion test and use traditional rules of trademark and unfair competition for substantive purposes.82 However, "[w]hile ? 43(a) claims are frequently conjoined with statutory patent, trademark, and copyright claims, it cannot be assumed that every act of trademark, copyright or patent infringement is, ipso facto, a violation of Section 43(a)."83 On the other hand, the fact that another form of intellectual property protection is unavailable does not preclude protec- tion under ? 43(a).84 Another source of protection to trademark holders is an action for dilu- tion-a state-based subset of trademark law that concerns the weakening of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name.85 There are currently 80.

Basically, ? 43(a) tracks the law and requirements of registered marks, including the need for secondary meaning for nondistinctive marks, id. at 87 (Supp. 1988), and is considered by many courts as the equivalent of a claim of trademark infringement for unregistered marks. See, e.g., Banff, Ltd. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., 841 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1988); A.J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman, 808 F.2d 291, 296 (3d Cir. 1986); Union Mfg. Co. v. Han Baek Trading Co., 763 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2nd Cir. 1985). Section 43(a) differs little from the law governing marks. The only exceptions are that some impact on interstate com- merce must be shown, and that there is no presumption of validity where the claim is brought on behalf of an unregistered mark. Regardless of any added evidential burdens, this section remains the only one in the Lanham Act that extends protection to unregistered marks. See 815 Tonawanda Street Corp. v. Fay's Drug Co., 842 F.2d 643, 646 (2d Cir. 1988); Centaur Communications, Ltd. v. A/S/M Communications, Inc., 830 F.2d 1217, 1220 (2d Cir. 1987). 83. Marcia B.

Dilution statutes thus potentially provide the most expansive protection against the unauthorized use of fictional characters that have become indica- tors of source.87 Its expansive protection, however, has so far prevented di- lution from becoming a federal cause of action.88 2. Proving consumer confusion. Early courts applied trademark and unfair competition laws to protect literary characters against the unauthorized use of their names and the titles of the work within which they appeared.89 These early courts were also concerned about false attribution of an unauthorized work to the owner of the character.90 For example, in a 1939 case91 involving an unauthorized use of the character Stella Dallas (from the novel of the same name) in radio skits broadcast as episodes in the life of the character, the author alleged that the artistic and commercial quality of the television skits would decrease sales of her novel and of any potential sequel, and would also harm her reputation. The court denied NBC's motion to dismiss, reasoning: If... in these broadcasts the defendant had appropriated, without plain- tiff's consent, the plot and principal characters of the novel, and ... the use being made of her literary production was such as to injure the reputation of the work and of the author, and to amount to a deception upon the public, it may well be that relief would be afforded by applying well-recognized prin- ciples of equity which have been developed in the field known as "unfair competition."92 86.

(BNA) 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981) (adult-oriented satire of characters constitutes fair use, but nevertheless violates state anti- dilution statute). 88. Given courts' actual treatment of state anti-dilution statutes, the first Senate report on the Trademark Law Revision Act, which supported adding dilution, took a very naive view of dilution: "[C]oncerns that a federal dilution provision will reach to the use of another's trademark in compara- tive advertising, satire, consumer reporting, and editorial comment are unfounded; by its nature, dilu- tion does not and cannot reach to these fair uses of another's trademark." S. REP. No. 100-515, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1988) (report to accompany S. 1883) (emphasis added). Interested groups responded that fair use would be affected and first amendment values would be impaired. See H.R. REP. No. 100-1028, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1988) (report to accompany H.R. 5372). Such con- cerns ultimately defeated the federalization of dilution actions. Gilson, supra note 86, at COMM-5. 89. See Warner Bros. Pictures v.

These cases often involved an exact copy, including the name of a character in such a use that there was no reason not to assume that it was by the owner or creator. With the rise of conver- gence, courts seem less interested in how likely public confusion is before finding an infringement. 91. Prouty v. National Broadcasting Co., 26 F. Supp. 265, 266 (D.

Star Co.,93 early cases established that graphic characters' names, configurations, and indicia could function as marks once they have acquired secondary meaning.94 In that case, plaintiff was a car- toon artist who had entitled a book "Mutt 'N' Jeff Cartoons" and registered the trademark "Mutt 'N' Jeff" in his own name before the strip was syndi- cated.95 When he changed syndicators, the former employer hired new art- ists to continue the cartoon strip using the same title, names, and characters.96 The court used a dilution-type analysis to enjoin Star Co.'s unauthorized use of Mutt and Jeff cartoons. The court felt that such use may result in the public tiring of the "Mutt and Jeff" cartoons by reason of inferior imitations or otherwise, [and such unauthorized use would be] an unfair appropriation of [Fisher's] skill and the celebrity acquired by him in originating, producing and maintaining the characters and figures so as to continue the demand for further cartoons ... ."97 More recent cases affirm the ability of trademark law to protect fictional characters. The critical statutory interpretation in In re DC Comics, Inc. ,98 conclusively held that a graphic character can function as a protectable mark. This rule applies even where the character is used as a mark on goods within which it serves an expressive function. The court stated that stylized drawings of characters, even if they were pictorial representations of the dolls which they marked, were fully capable of serving as trademarks.99 93. 231 N.Y. 414, 132 N.E. 133 (1921), cert. denied, 257 U.S. 654 (1921). 94.

The figures and names have been so connected with [Fisher] as their originator or author, that the use by another of new cartoons exploiting the characters "Mutt and Jeff" would be unfair to the public and to the plaintiff.

III. CONVERGENCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DOCTRINES PRODUCES AN IMPENETRABLE SHIELD FOR FICTIONAL CHARACTERS During the past twenty years, courts, often at the urging of character owners, have dissolved the analytical boundaries between statutory copy- right, statutory and common law trademark, unfair competition, and dilu- tion, thereby retooling traditional tests of infringement to produce particularly strong, and at times too strong, protection for fictional charac- ters. The process can be seen as a convergence of these legal doctrines, whereby the strengths of each doctrine are accentuated and their weaknesses diminished. Three distinct characteristics mark the process of convergence. First, courts functionally merge various tests of infringement without regard to the underlying causes of action. For instance, courts frequently apply the "look and feel" test developed to gauge consumer confusion in trademark cases to measure similarity between an original and an alleged copy of an expressive work and to determine the likelihood of confusion, regardless of whether copyright or trademark infringement is at issue. Second, courts use similar language and reasoning when analyzing intellectual property claims-ex- pressing no recognition of how these laws protect different aspects and quali- ties of characters. Courts often discuss public confusion as to source during copyright analyses, and, where the character is a mark, they often focus on the character itself rather than on the information it conveys about particu- lar products. Third, character owners exploit the lax judicial analysis and allege most, if not all, conceivable claims in every case-copyright, federal and common law trademark, ? 43(a), state antidilution, and unfair competi- tion. Owners have learned that a favorable ruling on any single count often allows finding infringement on other counts, with little or no additional showing.101 These characteristics combine to ease the formerly strict com- 100. Id. at 1044. 101. A precursor of this last category would seem to be the increasing ability of plaintiffs to get some, if not all, claims of infringement redressed once a case is brought, especially when a finding of infringement under one claim often reduces the plaintiff's evidentiary burden on other claims. Attempts to expand character protection are ultimately aimed at favorably tipping the eco- nomic balance struck by copyright law. "Copyright protection-the right of the copyright's owner to prevent others from making copies-trades off the costs of limiting access to a work against the benefits of providing incentives to create the work in the first place." William M. Landes &amp; Richard A. Posner, An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, 18 J. LEGAL STUD. 325, 326 (1989). Trademark law similarly balances the cost of granting exclusive use of a trademark with the benefit of reducing consumer search costs. Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 18, at 269. For the most part, then, it is the benefits bestowed by copyright which character owners seek to gain a larger part of. The idea/expression dichotomy and the fair use doctrine "can be understood as attempts to 641</page><page sequence="20">STANFORD LAW REVIEW mon law requirements for protection of fictional characters. A. Historical Baseline: Discrete Intellectual Property Analysis In the past courts recognized clear boundaries between copyright and trademark claims, requiring distinct and different evidentiary showings to establish infringement for each. The cases establishing the foundations of intellectual property protection for fictional characters102 evidence just such an approach, and this recognition of boundaries continued for some time thereafter. In Gruelle v. Molly-'Es Doll Outfitters'03 the court protected the name 'Raggedy Ann' as a trademark, but refused to extend trademark protection to the doll itself. "The valuable good will which Gruelle has built up in this character of his creation is being appropriated by the defendants as a result of use of the tag 'Raggedy Ann' upon the dolls of the defendants' design and manufacture."104 The court refused to enjoin the making of a "deceptively similar" doll, however, in the absence of a copyright infringement claim. The court felt that copyright was the proper cause of action for the expres- sion of the character. The absence of such a claim meant defendant could continue manufacturing the doll under a different name.105 Dolls based on Dr. Seuss characters, and sold as Dr. Seuss creations, were at issue in Geisel v. Poynter Products, Inc. 106 The court first determined that the sale of cartoons to codefendant included their copyright, and there- fore the right to make three-dimensional representations.107 However, the court then reviewed separately the extent of the defendant's right to use the name "Dr. Seuss" under ? 43(a) and state unfair competition. The defend- ant was found to have infringed with previously used tags that stated "From the Wonderful World of Dr. Seuss"; on the other hand, subsequent tags specifying that the dolls were "Based on Liberty Magazine Illustrations by promote economic efficiency by balancing the effect of greater copyright protection-in encouraging the creation of new works by reducing copying-against the effect of less protection-in encouraging the creation of new works by reducing the cost of creating them." Landes &amp; Posner, An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, supra at 333. Utilizing trademark and unfair competition laws may well restrain expressive or ornamental uses which would otherwise be permitted under merely a copyright regime. The entire market for a particular character-including new personalities the owner of the former character considers "too similar"-is locked up, perhaps indefinitely. The danger is that trademark's grant of exclusivity may prevent unauthorized uses of the character which copyright law allows, such as under fair use and parody. This problem is compounded when the character is granted trademark protection without a showing that the character indicates source for a good or service. For example, a picture of King Kong may instantly be recognized as the legendary gorilla, yet its appearance does not identify a single authorizing source. Thus, new uses of the King Kong character in no way implicate the reputation of the character owner. See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., 746 F.2d 112 (2d Cir. 1984). 102.

Kenner Products109 the court carefully delineated and analyzed the separate requirements of copyright and unfair competition claims. At issue were action figures of heroes and villains from "Star Team," dolls in the vein of the Star Wars characters. The court first focused on the copyright claim and applied the rule it deduced from Nichols, that the alleged infringing character must be a copy to infringe.10 The court then turned to the unfair competition claim, noting that it was "not limited solely to considerations relevant to copyright.""' Even if defendant had copied the characters, the court had to determine if the copies misled the public for the latter cause of action to stand. B. The Slide Into Doctrinal Convergence During the 1970s, the imperative for character owners to seek greater protection for their creations was growing. While restrained protection may have been bearable previously, owners faced older characters approaching the end of their copyright term in the foreseeable future.12 At the same time, there was a growth in means for exploiting characters. For example, the development of the VCR allowed new markets for movies, and meant past works could be re-released to the home market. Advancements in spe- cial effects allowed the creation of more realistic live action movies based on or heavily dependent on fictional characters."3 The comic book industry itself continued to expand: "fandom" had arisen and grown in the 1960s,14 and the value of back issue comic books, as an indicator of investor involve- ment, increased phenomenally from the early seventies into the 1980s, and beyond.15 And who can forget the establishment and success of the Walt Disney theme parks-based in no small part on the popularity of certain mice and ducks, princesses and princes, witches and magic apples, and any number of live-action characters. 1.

And the movie Superman replicated the superhero's feats of strength and flight in realistic fashion. 114. R. OVERSTREET, supra note 4, at A-69. 115.

The popularity of a character began to implicitly, if not explicitly, be factored into the analysis of substantial similarity. And look- ing to the "feel" of a character necessarily reduced the degree of similarity a plaintiff needed to prove. In Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates,"l6 the district court rejected the narrow view that cartoon characters were protected only when the al- leged infringer duplicated both the characters and their previous exploits.117 Addressing the copying of the world's most famous rodent in an adult-ori- ented, counter-culture comic book, the court was faced with the "story-be- ing-told" test from the "Sam Spade" case. In an effort to respect this precedent, 18 the trial court held that Mickey Mouse was, in fact, "the story being told"1'9 because he and the other Disney characters dominated the plot.'20 Mingling the elements of copyright infringement with trademark infringement, the court expanded its copyright analysis to note that the char- acters had "achieved a high degree of 'recognition' and 'identification.' " It was these elements that made the work protectable.121 The district court thus showed an active willingness to structure its rea- soning such that the characters-Disney characters-would be protected. More important, however, was the infusion of subjective criteria, akin to those of trademark's secondary meaning, into the similarity review. In this fashion, identification and recognition narrow the gap between acceptable caricatures and infringing copies. One can also question whether the type of character made a difference.122 For example, if it were James Bond instead of Mickey Mouse, would the court have found the use permissible, or at least not factored in the degree of recognition as a protectable element? After the Air Pirates opinion, the Ninth Circuit delivered a decision 116. 345 F. Supp. 108 (N.D. Cal. 1972), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 581 F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1132 (1979). 117. See National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications, 191 F.2d 594, 600 (2d Cir. 1951), opinion clarified, 198 F.2d 927 (2d Cir. 1952). 118. Disney originally argued for the protection of its characters as "copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted" as provided for under ? 3 of the 1909 Copyright Act and supported, in part, by the early cartoon cases. However, the lower court followed the "test" of Warner v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 216 F.2d 945 (9th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 971 (1955), reason- ing that this "story being told" precedent applied to all character infringement cases, literary or cartoon, and thus precluded protection under ? 3. The court's mistake is that a cartoon character differs from a literary work, at least insofar as it can garer protection through its graphic, artistic qualities, apart from being a developed character. See Marks, supra note 44, at 40. While the hold- ing remained the same, the reasoning was revised on appeal. See text accompanying notes 127-132 infra. 119. Air Pirates, 345 F. Supp. at 113. 120. Id.

In Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions v. McDon- ald's Corp. 123 the court for the first time articulated the "look and feel" test in the context of a fictional character copyright claim. Reasoning that it is the "combination of many different elements which may command copyright protection because of its particular subjective quality,"124 the court found that "[t]he expression inherent in the H.R. Pufnstuf series differs markedly from its relatively simple idea. The characters each have developed person- alities and particular ways of interacting with one another and their environ- ment. The physical setting also has unique features."125 They then found that defendant's McDonaldland characters infringed those of the television series. The obvious danger from the application of look and feel is the second part of the test, "feel." With this approach, courts are no longer required to rest a decision on the graphic or descriptive similarity of characters, but can use the "feel" of the characters to make up for noted differences. While there is no need for the courts to require exact duplication-and there should not be any-this approach gets dangerously close to resting on ste- reotypes and general attributes of characters that are not protectable. Doesn't any "benevolent Hercules" feel like Superman? Doesn't any jungle man feel like Tarzan?126 The issue, then, is how courts will reasonably and predictably know when a second character feels like the first, but doesn't infringe it. The following year, the Ninth Circuit affirmed Air Pirates'27 but re- moved the "story-being-told" restriction from pictorial characters, limiting it to literary characters128 and further solidifying the "look and feel" test.129 The court distinguished a pictorial character from a literary character, say- ing that the former, "which has physical as well as conceptual qualities, is 123. 562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir. 1977). 124.

From the beginning, the court's position was that "copying a comic book character's graphic image constitutes copying to an extent sufficient to justify a finding of infringement." Id. at 756 (citations omitted). The court noted that it could evaluate the comic strip as a graphic illustra- tion under ? 3 of the 1909 Copyright Act or it could judge its total concept and feel because, unlike other "illustrations, a cartoon character's image is intertwined with its personality and other traits."

Cases concerned primarily with registered name trademarks also demon- strated convergence of copyright and trademark. In Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. v. Manns Theatres133 the plaintiff, who owned the rights to the charac- ter Tarzan and had registered the name "Tarzan" as a trademark, sought to enjoin the unauthorized use of the name "Tarz" in the defendant's X-rated film entitled "Tarz &amp; Jane &amp; Boy &amp; Cheeta." The court began by observing that such use diluted the value of the registered mark and resulted in a likeli- hood of confusion as to authorship or sponsorship, although no proof of confusion had been provided.134 Then the court integrated these trademark elements into its copyright infringement analysis, producing a hybrid form of protection which included the term of protection of copyright and the absolute monopoly of trademark: "Famous character names in copyrighted works may not be used by others during the life of the copyright without the authorization of the copyright proprietor."135 Any use of "Tarzan," "Jane," "Boy," and "Cheeta," or colorable imitations, fell fully under plaintiff's control. Even assuming for the moment that the use of the word "famous" pro- vides evidence that the court found the names to have secondary meaning, the court still got it wrong by granting a monopoly in the names of these characters for the entire copyright term, regardless of any changes in public recognition or loss of secondary meaning.136 The variety of protection granted here is uniquely immune to both fair use, a major defense to copy- 130.

Further evidence of convergence is contained in the court's finding that use of plaintiff's charac- ters, not just their names, impaired the corporation's goodwill and would lead potential customers to become confused. Id. There was never a discussion of whether the characters, absent the simultane- ous use of their names, were trademarks. The court also failed to discuss whether the defendant's representation of the Tarzan and Jane characters were recognizable absent the use of the names, and engaged in no review of whether there was confusion, or a likelihood thereof. 135. Id. at 162. 136. Registered trademarks must be periodically renewed, which includes an affirmation of their continued use. Under Burroughs, protection of a name would be guaranteed for the life of the copyright regardless of whether the name was used, its failure to signify a single source, or whether the ownership of rights was fractionalized.

Copyright "look and feel" turns back to supplant trademark The convergence of copyright and mark-based analysis became more widespread in the 1980s as intellectual property doctrines became even less distinct in the context of character protection suits. Courts mingled ele- ments of unfair competition causes of action in their discussion of copyright infringement. At least one court went so far as to create a hybrid "copy- right-dilution" cause of action.137 The "total look and feel" test became per- vasive in both trademark and copyright actions. Eager to extend protection to fictional characters,138 courts applied an amorphous grab bag of tests and elements, merging all areas of intellectual property. Greater reliance on Lanham Act ? 43(a) in this already crowded field of causes of the action only complicated issues further. In DC Comics, Inc. v. Filmation Associates, 39 the court allowed a ? 43(a) claim to stand in place of what the court stated was a copyright violation.140 Despite recognizing the applicability of copyright for protecting characters, the court found that a character necessarily operates as an indicator of source, even when its exclu- sive use is as a component in a larger copyrighted work. The better ap- proach would have been to force the plaintiff to bring its action under copyright, or at least require proof of consumer confusion, or a significant likelihood thereof, before proceeding on the ? 43(a) claim. Instead, the court stated: [O]ur reading of the cases in this circuit shows that where the product... is "entertainment" ..., then not only the advertising of the product but also an ingredient of the product itself can amount to a trademark protectable under ? 43(a) because the ingredient can come to symbolize the plaintiff or its product in the public mind.'41 run indefinitely if it continues to meet all these requirements, this holding also may suggest that once the copyright lapses, the use of the name as a mark also lapses, regardless of trademark validity. 137. DC Comics, Inc. v. Unlimited Monkey Business, Inc., 598 F. Supp. 110, 115 (N.D. Ga. 1984). 138. Courts seem to attribute human traits to inanimate characters, often treating them as having their own reputational interest capable of being impugned by unauthorized, especially dispar- aging, uses. See text accompanying note 147 infra. 139. 486 F. Supp. 1273 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (plaintiff alleged defendant's two animated television series starred characters which infringed its two characters, "Aquaman" and "Plastic Man," through similarity in abilities and names). 140. Id. at 1276. The facts in Filmation do not explain why the plaintiff did not allege copy- right infringement. 141. Id. at 1277 (footnote omitted). Plaintiff DC Comics argued that ? 43(a) "protects its characters, including all their traits and abilities, from copying and imitation by others," while de- fendant Filmation sought to limit ? 43(a) to "palming off" and false advertising. Id. at 1276-77. While the court says it finds the defendant's argument "largely correct," it nonetheless adopted a view more consistent with the plaintiff's interpretation. Section 43(a) has become a potent tool for protecting characters because the plaintiff's eviden- tiary burden is low following Filmation. See Culliford v. CBS, Inc., 222 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 497 (D.D.C. 1984) (Smurf cartoon characters); Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co., 526 F.

Not surprisingly, with this major threshold ques- tion eliminated, ? 43(a) is transformed into a powerful tool for character protection, particularly where a copyright claim is not promising.142 In DC Comics Inc. v. Unlimited Monkey Business,143 the court blends federal statutory copyright and state statutory dilution actions to create none other than "copyright dilution."144 In addressing the defendant's fair use defense to the copyright infringement claim, the court permits potential harm to the "'all-American' image" of DC's characters, a trademark argu- ment, to become the "damage to the market" factor in the fair use analy- sis.145 However, plaintiff was never required to demonstrate any actual or likely harm based on this tarnishment as it was just presumed by the court. Further, the court does not appear to be concerned with the market for the original work(s) in terms of competing with these tarnishing uses of the characters. Instead, it concerns itself with how the satirical use of the char- acters will diminish their marketability in the future,146 again without any showing to this effect. The court similarly permitted copyright elements to blend into its trade- mark analysis. Instead of discussing the goodwill created in the names as quality indicators of their products, the court attributed the goodwill to the characters themselves. "Superman and Wonder Woman marks have ac- quired outstanding celebrity ... as unique distinctive marks symbolizing the Bear cartoon character and doll). But see Superior Models, Inc. v. Tolkien Enterprises, 211 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 587, 591 (D. Del. 1981) (protection not available for characters from "Lord of the Rings" for failure to establish secondary meaning). 142. Without proof of consumer confusion it would be impossible for the plaintiff to establish that aspects of the characters, or the characters themselves, which serve a trademark function are infringed. Additional cases merging trademark elements into copyright analysis include Filmvideo Releasing Corp. v. Hastings, 509 F. Supp. 60, 66 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (being "well known to the public" is considered one of the factors supporting "copyrightability" for the character "Hopalong Cas- sidy"), aff'd, 668 F.2d 91 (2d Cir. 1981). 143. 598 F. Supp. 110 (N.D. Ga. 1984). 144. Id. at 115. Defendant's use of like costumes, balloons featuring the characters, use of the "Superman" name in advertisements, and use of indicia in "skits" performed by their employees are all found to violate plaintiff's rights under copyright, trademark, state statutory antidilution, and ? 43(a). Although it is clear from the facts of the case that infringement was present, the ease with which the court finds every attribute or trait of DC's characters to be suggestive of that character suggests that it is highly likely that any similar activity of Monkey Business would have been found infringing. 145. Id. at 118. The court stated: A second type of effect on the potential market for or value of plaintiff's copyrighted works results from the implicit disparagement and bawdy associations undisputably cre- ated by some of defendant's adaptations. This harm is akin to that of dilution in trademark law, but it does not merely lessen the distinctiveness of plaintiff's works: it tarnishes the "all-American" image that plaintiff has labored to create and to preserve. Id. (emphasis added). 146. The problem with such an approach is that it arguably doesn't limit itself to uses which infringe on the basis of similarity. Therefore, even noninfringing parodies that are ribald or bawdy could be prevented, especially when dealing with an "all-American" or "straight-laced" character.</page><page sequence="27">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS 649 extensive goodwill associated with the public image of this hero and hero- ine."147 Meaningless for trademark laws, which do not protect characters for their own sake, this was dangerously close to the "quality-of-the-part-taken" factor used in copyright fair use analysis. Since it appears from the facts that defendant's activities infringed, it was not necessary for the court to take this approach even if it was determined to protect this "hero and heroine." Sound, and separate, trademark and copy- right analyses would have found infringement, and copyright dilution need never have been created. The previous cases reveal courts influential in the character protection arena borrowing concepts and tests from a number of intellectual property laws; they then crafted new, and mostly problematic, approaches to charac- ter protection. This influence carried over to other courts and other deci- sions. At times, it seems that courts are simply confused about how to apply both copyright and trademark to the same characters.148 At other times, 147. 598 F. Supp. at 115 (emphasis added); see also Walt Disney Co. v. Powell, 698 F. Supp. 10 (D.D.C. 1988), aff'd in part, vacated in part as to damages calculation, 897 F.2d 565 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Disney's copyrights in Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse will be enforced as to exact cop- ies and variations of Mickey and Minnie. These variations are classic examples of trade dress violations, for Mickey and Minnie have acquired not only a secondary meaning, but a meaning of great value, favorable in all respects, and well-entrenched worldwide. [Defend- ant's] free ride on the ingenuity, skillful promotion, and resulting public acceptance which Disney has rightfully gainedfrom these charming mouse characters must come to an end. Id. at 12 (emphasis added). There are a number of ways in which this comment sums up the effects of convergence. What the court referred to as protection of trade dress is really the recognition that copyright protection extends to variations of characters not previously expressed. Note how the discussion starts with Disney's copyrights but ends with how a variation of the copyright-protected expression is really trade dress protection. Perhaps even more telling, goodwill is not discussed in terms of the company's products and services, but in terms of the good will of the marks themselves. It is the "charm" of the marks that the court finds infringed! A similar merging of trademark and copyright is found in Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. v. High Society Magazine, 7 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1862 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (court rejected the satire defense as to allegedly infringing article, "Monkeying Around With Tarzan and Jane," finding it likely to cause confusion, mistake, deception, and dilution in the mind of any reader of the magazine; specifically, court reasoned everyone would believe corporate trademark owner approved of the use of its mark, thereby impugning the Tarzan characters and injuring corporation's identity). 148. A number of cases show how courts "slip," or otherwise show confusion, mixing up trademark and copyright policies. For example, in Warner Brothers, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 530 F. Supp. 1187 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), aff'd, 720 F.2d 231 (2d Cir. 1983), the court discusses protecting a "copyrighted phrase" from commercial exploitation. The flaw in this analysis is that a phrase can not be copyrighted, 37 C.F.R. ? 202.1(a) (1990) (material not subject to copyright in- cludes "words and short phrases such as names, titles, and slogans"), but can only be protected as a trademark. See also Burroughs v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 388 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), aff'd, 683 F.2d 610 (2d Cir. 1982). The lower court observed: "Tarzan is the ape-man. He is an individual closely in tune with his jungle environment, able to communicate with animals yet able to experience human emotions. He is athletic, innocent, youthful, gentle and strong. He is Tarzan." Id. at 391. These are ideas, however, that cannot be copyrighted, and should not be relied on as the only means of identifying Tarzan as protected under copyright. Cf Conan Properties v. Mattel, Inc., 712 F. Supp. 353, 359 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (court recognizes similarity of characters in this genre is based on shared, unprotectable characteristics). Neither are individual attributes protectable in terms of ? 43(a). DC Comics, Inc. v. Filmation Assocs., 486 F. Supp. at 1277 n. 12. Confusion, or at least "sloppy" reasoning, is seen in United Feature Syndicate v. Sunrise Mold Co., 569 F. Supp. 1475, 1479 (S.D. Fla. 1983), in which the court found that sale of molds for</page><page sequence="28">STANFORD LAW REVIEW courts seem to freely expand protection without explaining the boundaries of their approach. The courts' general "confusion" of the elements of analysis of copyright, trademark, and unfair competition applied to the same character is demon- strated by cases where courts restrict the trademark protection by applying restrictive elements of copyright analysis. For instance, in Warner Bros. v. American Broadcasting Cos.,149 Superman suffered his first defeat, without the intervention of magic or kryptonite, when the district court rejected both the plaintiff's copyright and unfair competition claims based upon the dis- similarity of the "total concept and feel" of the two works.150 The unfair competition claim received no independent consideration, thus allowing a single analysis to address the different concerns of these two laws. Although separate analyses would likely have yielded the same result in this case, this will not always be true. Thus, it was dangerous precedent to take such an approach. The Second Circuit affirmed, and further entrenched the "total look and feel" approach. The court again analytically linked trademark and copy- right, noting that a lack of substantial similarity "leaves little basis for assert- ing likelihood of confusion";'15 its approach thus disregarded other acts which may yet lead a less than substantially similar character to confuse consumers.152 Further, the court adopted an expansive view of ? 43(a) pro- tection for characters, based upon its earlier decision in Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd. 153 However, even this doctrine was infected with copyright, the court applying a type of idea/expression dichotomy to find ? 43(a) can't protect ideas.154 In Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co.,155 the Second Circuit applied the "total look and feel" test, but in a decidedly copyright fashion, to the alleged infringement of the character trademark of King Kong by the video game Donkey Kong. The court decided the case on a similarity com- parison, never considering the likelihood of consumer confusion. Courts no longer recognize any difference between the doctrines when applied to the different claims. 56 making plastic dolls based on plaintiff's "Peanuts" character diluted the distinctive quality of the names, as well as likenesses, of the characters. Again, it is a strain to show trademark dilution of the name when not attached to the infringing product. See also note 177 infra. 149. 530 F. Supp. 1187 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), aff'd, 720 F.2d 231 (2d Cir. 1983) (Plaintiff owner of "Superman" alleged the defendant's television character "Ralph Hinkley," from the show "The Greatest American Hero," infringed Superman under copyright, ? 43(a), common law unfair com- petition, and New York's dilution statute.). 150.

Columbia Pictures Indus.,157 and Conan Properties v. Mattel, Inc.,158 also demonstrate courts' quixotic intel- lectual property analysis. Harvey Cartoons follows Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co., holding that the common law trademark "Fatso," a member of the mischievous trio of ghosts accompanying "Casper, The Friendly Ghost," was not infringed by the defendant's "Ghostbusters" logo, but the court fails to consider consumer confusion. Instead, it borrows from copy- right analysis and states that the defendant has not appropriated the name, story line, or exact image of "Fatso," therefore the public could not be con- fused as a matter of law.159 Similarly, in Conan Properties the court related the analysis of Lanham Act ? 43(a) claims to copyright, finding that "He- Man" dolls were not substantially similar to the "Conan" character, despite the inapplicability of copyright considerations-the fair use defense, absolute necessity of similarities between works to determine infringement, and no requirement of confusion-to mark-based claims.160 Arising from this blending of various intellectual property doctrines, a greater ease in acquiring character protection became further entrenched in the Ninth Circuit in Olson v. National Broadcasting Co. 161 The court stated that the "mere chessman" language from the "Sam Spade" case was "argua- bly dicta."162 The court observed that it had extended copyright protection to cartoon characters in Air Pirates, as had the Second Circuit in Warner captures the 'total concept and feel'" of the protected character in order to determine whether there exists a fair jury issue on the likelihood of confusion. Universal City, 746 F.2d at 116. Applying "look and feel" is problematic because it is more properly a test in the less exacting review of unfair competition, not trademark (which focuses on discrete elements). See note 79 supra. 157. 645 F. Supp. 1564 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). 158. 712 F. Supp. 353 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). Plaintiff alleged defendant's He-Man doll infringed its character Conan. While the court found the Conan character had fallen into the public domain, id. at 358, CPI had added non-trivial, original expression to the Conan character so that it was protect- able enough under copyright to withstand an attack on the validity of CPI's copyrights in their Conan Comic books. Id. at 359 (citing Mattel, Inc. v. Azrak-Hamway Int'l, 724 F.2d 357, 360 (2d Cir. 1983)). However, recognizing the similarity of characters in the genre in the first instance prob- ably led the court to find that the protectable elements of the two characters were not substantially similar. 159. The court found that "there is no doubt that Columbia has not appropriated any of the indicia of 'Fatso.' Columbia has not taken his name, his storyline or his exact image." Harvey Cartoons, 645 F. Supp. at 1573 (emphasis added). The storyline, or plot, fits squarely in the realm of copyright; copyright requires that infringement be shown by similarity which goes beyond a proto- typical series of events to encompass the story itself. See, e.g., Berkic v. Crichton, 761 F.2d 1289, 1293 (9th Cir. 1985) ("The test for 'substantial similarity of ideas' compares, not the basic plot ideas for stories, but the actual concrete elements that make up the total sequence of events and the rela- tionships between the major characters."), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 826 (1985). One must therefore question how similarity in a storyline can be a factor in trademark infringement. How does infring- ing a plot equate with confusion as to the source of authorization of other products or services which are "represented" by a given character? Would such a review find infringement of the character as trademark, per se, if the plot is more similar but the allegedly infringing character less similar? 160. Conan Properties, 712 F. Supp. at 362. 161. 855 F.2d 1446 (9th Cir. 1988). 162. Id. at 1451-52. The court further noted: "In Walt Disney Prods. v. Air Pirates we recog- nized that it is unclear whether this language is dicta or an alternate holding, but we declined to resolve the issue because Warner Bros. could be distinguished on other grounds."

Therefore, it was willing to take the next step and extend protection to visually depicted characters appearing in television or in movies.163 This opened the door to extending copyright pro- tection to far less prominent characters, and perhaps eventually literary characters, with a substantially smaller burden on the plaintiff. It is likely that this will serve as the catalyst allowing convergence to become as promi- nent in the judicial philosophy of the Ninth Circuit as it currently is in the Second Circuit. IV. THE PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF CONVERGENCE A. Convergence Undermines the Policy Rationale of Intellectual Property Laws The convergence of intellectual property doctrines in the context of char- acter infringement cases undermines the public policies upon which these doctrines are based. The most notable impact is on policies underlying copy- right, although trademark and unfair competition rationales are also in- firmed. Six specific policy areas can be highlighted: the idea/expression dichotomy; the similarity requirement in copyright; fair use exceptions to exclusive rights; mark-based laws' requirement of consumer confusion; dura- tion of the term of protection; and the public domain. The idea/expression dichotomy appears to be the least harmed by con- vergence. On the one hand, it does not stand as the same barrier to protec- tion as it previously had. On the other hand, as a policy it remains virtually unchanged. Nevertheless, convergence has lead to the dichotomy leaking into trademark law, where it never before existed. While copyright will not, for example, protect the equation "e= mc2," trademark does not preclude its use as a mark, provided it attains secondary meaning, because the equation would still be free for use where source is not implied. However, at least one court faced with character protection stated that ideas can't be protected under unfair competition.164 This limits that which can serve as a mark, despite the fact that ideas functioning as formulas, processes, and so forth, would not be impinged by the trademark owners' rights. The similarity requirement of copyright has been notably changed. The introduction of "look and feel" and the focus on character notoriety have combined to lower the quantum of similarity the plaintiff must show. While this may seem "positive" to the degree that courts have previously been too strict in applying this requirement, unrestrained the approach goes too far. Unchecked, it expands the scope of exclusive rights of copyright to protect against the use of characters that are less and less similar. And there is absolutely no basis for considering notoriety. Characters that are copied should receive equal protection, regardless of popularity. The fair use defense is most affected when a clear parody or satire is 163. Id. at 1452. 164. See note 154 supra and accompanying text. [Vol. 44:623 652</page><page sequence="31">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS enjoined based on a mark-based action. The most notable example is the creation of "copyright dilution," which completely undercuts the policy of fair use.165 Considering the good will of the character mark, like consider- ing popularity, also operates against parody. If the character and not the owner is credited as the source of the good will, then the plaintiff has an easier time arguing that the quality of the part taken in the fair use analysis works against the parodist. While cases addressing parodies of non-charac- ter marks suggest that fair use is applicable,166 when the "inherent qualities" of the mark itself are considered, parody can be prevented.167 The requirement that a competing mark confuse, or likely confuse, con- sumers in order to be found infringing has been weakened by convergence. Influenced by copyright's focus on similarity, less similar and potentially less confusing marks are considered infringing because trademark's usual con- cern for consumer confusion has been displaced with a more isolated inquiry that simply asks whether two particular configurations look and feel alike.168 Where insufficient similarity exists to support a copyright infringement ac- tion, plaintiffs will have difficulty proving confusion as to source. Still, it is not a forgone conclusion. For example, one might defend against a copy- right infringement action by asserting a fair use parody and yet not be able to disprove consumer confusion. With regard to the terms of protection, convergence benefits those seek- ing stronger protection for creative works,169 while overlooking the policy rationale for limited length or scope of protection. For copyright, a term limit provides artists with sufficient exclusive use to encourage new works, but eventually these works enter the public domain and benefit society as a whole. Similarly, trademark laws protect marks that convey information about source to consumers, but allow expressive uses of common words and images to continue. Under convergence, courts tie an indefinite and com- mercially motivated term of protection to copyright based claims, extending the fixed-term, broad protection for expressive uses provided by copyright to cover both non-expressive works and uses. The result is that the longest protection term is linked to the widest possible scope of protection without 165. See notes 143-147 supra and accompanying text. 166. See notes 201-209 infra and accompanying text. 167. See note 213 infra and accompanying text. 168. The application of the "total concept and feel" test to trademark and unfair competition is crucial because trademark is not supposed to be fluid, but fixed. As marks with the same "feel" as others are found to be infringing, the importance of trademark's emphasis on significant similarity and genuine confusion is diminished. The fact that trademarks in the forms of words, names, and short phrases have never been the proper subject matter for copyright protection, 37 C.F.R. ? 202.1 (1989), should warn courts to look beyond expressive similarities for evidence of confusion. A par- ody may infringe a copyright and yet be sufficiently outrageous that no one purchasing it would think it came from the same source as the original. 169. The reasoning may go as follows: "If protection comes through over-expansive ? 43(a) or unfair competition applications rather than, say, a specific 'characters' rights' provision in the Copy- right Act, so be it. Why let strict, formalistic applications of these laws prevent a positive outcome, especially where the causes of action are related?" 653</page><page sequence="32">STANFORD LAW REVIEW regard to the underlying qualities170 of the character. Finally, there is a long-term problem resulting from the effect of conver- gence on terms of protection: its impact on characters which fall into the public domain. From a copyright perspective, a public domain character may be used in new, expressive works without prior authorization. Unfair competition and trademark laws, however, seek to prevent consumer confu- sion by limiting the use of an established character regardless of whether the character is in the public domain. This timing conflict creates the long term problem, addressed below. B. The Long Term Problem of Convergence-Fictional Characters Falling into the Public Domain The long-term problem of convergence is that merging of intellectual property laws will make public domain works unavailable for new expressive uses. By attaching a copyright scope of exclusivity to mark-based laws while retaining trademark's term of protection, a character owner can prevent un- authorized uses of a character in perpetuity. This nullifies the balance struck between copyright's broad protection and limited duration of exclusivity and trademark's narrow protection but unlimited duration of protection. The first step in addressing the public domain problem is determining when the copyright of a character in a series of works expires.171 In other words, what role does a derivative work's copyright play after the first work passes into the public domain? Most commentators argue that once the copyright on the original story or cartoon ends, the character's appearance or description, if not also its name, can be used by others.172 In practice, however, all relevant convergence-era cases have focused exclusively on whether the author has added new, protectable expression to a derivative work not in the public domain. When the author adds such expression, those aspects of the character are still a protected derivative work.173 170. Here "qualities" means whether the character functions as a true indicator of source or merely as an expressive element. 171. The determination is important because, as has been shown with such characters as Sher- lock Holmes, Superman, and Mickey Mouse, the value and popularity of characters can last for more than half a century, and they can still appear in new works after the copyright on the work in which they first appeared has expired. 172. Just as the copyright in a derivative work will not protect public domain portions of an underlying work as incorporated in the derivative work, so copyright in a particular work in a series will not protect the character as contained in the series if the work in such series in which the character first appeared has entered the public domain.

CBS, Inc. 174 the court reasoned that a change in medium from radio to television gave the defendant continuing protection of its "Amos 'n' Andy" television characters despite the fact that the literary works-radio scripts-in which the characters first appeared had fallen into the public domain.175 One commentator explained the court's decision by emphasizing that the plaintiff copied from the protected television shows rather than public domain radio scripts, and that courts grant visual arts greater protection than literary works.176 However, if the expression of the character is the same as the expression in the public domain work, this con- cern is immaterial; once a character is in the public domain, all expressive uses of it are permissible. Two recent cases have similarly extended derivative copyright protection to newly added features. In Harvey Cartoons v. Columbia Pictures Indus.,177 the court discussed how derivative works could protect an original work to the extent the author added "original embellishments," even if the original work was in the public domain.178 Conan Properties, Inc. v. Mattel, Inc. 179 employed a similar analysis. Noting that a derivative work must contain originality, the court nevertheless found Conan Properties's contribution to its Conan comic books to be original expression and sufficient to withstand attack.180 Thus the court would allow some degree of derivative copyright protection. 181 174. 632 F. Supp. 1344 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). 175. While Nimmer characterizes this as dictum, M. NIMMER &amp; D. NIMMER, supra note 33, ? 2.12, at 2-178 n.23.4, another commentator argues that Nimmer's view directly contradicts the court's holding. Adele L. Gentin, A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words: The Basis for Copyright- ability of Characters in Public Domain Works, 12 COLUM. J. L. &amp; ARTS 73, 86 (1987). 176. Gentin, supra note 175, at 86. 177. 645 F. Supp. 1564 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (plaintiff's character "Fatso" was in the public do- main because of failure to renew the copyright, as required under the 1909 Act). The facts estab- lished that "the depiction of ["the Ghostly Trio," of which "Fatso" is one], as they exist in plaintiff's later issues, are derived largely from the graphics used in the older works." Id. at 1567. 178. The court found that "'Fatso's' most distinctive feature, his basic top-knotted design, ha[d] not changed to any appreciable degree since 1955.... The only appreciable 'original contribu- tion' made to 'Fatso' in Harvey's derivative works [was] new storyline." Id. at 1570. This logically leads to the conclusion that had new features been added in the course of a derivative work, and had defendant copied these features, then the court would have found infringement. 179. 712 F. Supp. 353 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). The original Conan stories by Robert E. Howard, written before 1936, were published in Weird Tales magazine and subsequently fell into the public domain when only seven of the magazine's 17 blanket copyrights were renewed. Id. at 357-58. CPI holds copyright for eight comic books published in the late 1970s that were derived from Howard's character. 180. Id. at 359 (relying on Mattel, Inc. v. Azrak-Hamway Int'l, 724 F.2d 357, 360 (2d Cir. 1983), which held that accentuation of certain muscle groups could be protectable expression). 181. These cases imply that an evolving character has a greater chance of maintaining copy- right protection even if its original work is in the public domain. This is a situation that convergence promises to alter. Continual addition of new expression, along with deemphasizing "older aspects," may change the character's "total concept and feel, now thrust to the forefront by convergence." Such changes will allow copyright protection to continue for the latest configuration of the charac- ter-the character with the greatest commercial potential. Theoretically, such changes should en- danger the character's trademark status because of the need for a mark to remain stable over time. See Waldheim, supra note 96, at 217. However, the physical appearance of a cartoon character</page><page sequence="34">656 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 1. Trademark and unfair competition may validly protect fictional characters that have fallen into the public domain. Non-copyright causes of action can prevent the unauthorized use of otherwise public domain characters. The issue arises most frequently when an author creates a new work incorporating a public domain character, but then encounters charges from the owner of mark-based rights remaining in the character that such use violates these rights,182 even in the absence of a "passing off" allegation. Courts have approved the use of mark-based laws to protect characters in the public domain.'83 Before reviewing the applicable cases, it is important to understand that could remain stable, while nonphysical elements, such as character relationships, collections of abili- ties, and storylines as to origins, are in flux. Examples of this phenomenon abound in comics. One common example is a new character taking on the name, abilities, and costume of an established character, thereby maintaining the estab- lished costume and "powers" but with a new "total concept and feel." See, e.g., MARVEL COMICS GROUP, IRON MAN, issue 169 (1982) (young African-American begins wearing the hero's "armour" costume previously worn by a middle-aged, alcoholic white male; although the replacement is tem- porary, the newer character becomes a second Iron Man); DC COMICS, GREEN LANTERN, issue 195 (1985) (aggressive, violent "Guy Gardner" replaces older, more passive "Hal Jordan" as hero "Green Lantern"; some alterations in costume, though basic color scheme and emblems remain unchanged, and definite differences in attitude; again the latter eventually returns, but the former remains); and, in one of the most famous story lines of recent years, DC COMICS, BATMAN, issues 357, 366, 368 (1983), 408-10 (1987), 426-29 (1988), 442 (1989), 457 (1990) ("Dick Greyson," origi- nal alter ego of "Robin," has become a new hero, '"Nightwing," and "Jason Todd," a troubled youth, becomes the "new" Robin, though still in same costume. Shortly thereafter, Jason Todd is killed and a third youth is introduced, with yet another origin and personality, who eventually be- comes Robin. This third Robin adopts a modernized version of the original costume and depiction of the name "Robin." See also DC COMICS, ROBIN, issue 1 (1990)). As for characters who have their origins rewritten many years after they are introduced, or simply become "parallel characters" with similar powers but variations on the original costume, though "symbols" are usually main- tained, see Harry B. Thomas, In A League Of Their Own!, in R. OVERSTREET, supra note 4, at A-77; Gary M. Carter, The Silver Age ... The Beginning, in R. OVERSTREET, supra note 4, at A-94. 182. It is not much of an issue where someone wants to use a public domain character as their mark. In such cases, if the copyright owner has used the character in the past there is less of a problem in at least identifying, if not going to trial on, the trademark and unfair competition issues. 183. See, e.g., notes 194-200 infra and accompanying text. It remains questionable whether protection extends to the public domain character as described or drawn on each and every page, or only to uses that imply source. If the former, the use of the character in a new work infringes trademark and unfair competition rights throughout the entire work. If the latter, only those aspects of the product that use the character's name or graphic representation can infringe the original work; examples include the placement of the character on the cover of a work or in advertisements. Two factors support the latter analysis. The first is from the court's review of the trademark infringement claim in Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751. The defendants referred to "Silly Sympathies," with a logo, as the title to two stories within their comic book. This is a takeoff on plaintiff's title for comic books "Silly Symphony," which included the words in a curving musical staff logo. The alleged infringement occurred solely within the comic. The court noted that imitation should be viewed "'in light of what occurs in the marketplace,' taking into account the 'circumstances sur- rounding the purchase of the goods.' " Id. at 759 (citations omitted). The court concluded that the district court "apparently did not consider that defendants' imitation appeared only in the middle of their comic books and that defendants' comic books were sold in adult, counter-culture stores," id. (emphasis added), yielding, in this context, a markedly diminished likelihood of confusion. The second factor is based on trademark law itself. Even given a high degree of similarity, if not outright duplication, the less likely the consumer is to make the purchase determination based on the interior of the work, the more likely that claims of infringement should focus on the outside appear- ance and marketing avenues of the works in question.</page><page sequence="35">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS once a fictional character that has been used expressively and indicatively falls into the public domain, it is the indicative functions which doctrinally are still subject to protection. In effect, then, the fictional character be- comes, like any other trademark logo or design, subject to the common law protections and restrictions that apply to non-character marks. The owner clearly will want to prevent any unauthorized uses of the "fictional character as mark" which attempt to take advantage of its secondary meaning. How- ever, the owner's interest doesn't stop there. Especially where the owner continues to use the fictional character in copyrightable works, s/he will attempt to extend the mark-based protection to unauthorized expressive uses. Boston Professional Hockey Ass'n. v. Dallas Cap &amp; Emblem Mfg. 84 is therefore a critical trademark case because it upholds mark-based protection against unauthorized, expressive uses of graphic trademarks.185 Plaintiffs brought unfair competition, trademark infringement, and ? 43(a) infringe- ment actions against a manufacturer of emblems that replicated their marks. The district court concluded that such protection would create a copyright monopoly for non-copyrighted designs,186 but the circuit court reasoned otherwise. Noting that, unlike mark-based laws, copyright provided that works would eventually enter the public domain,187 the court found: The trademark laws are based on the needed protection of the public and business interests and there is no reason why trademarks should ever pass into the public domain by the mere passage of time. Although our decision here may slightly tilt the trademark laws from the purpose of protecting the public to the protection of the business interests of plaintiffs, we think that the two become so intermeshed when viewed against the backdrop of the common law of unfair competition that both the public and plaintiffs are better served by granting the relief sought by plaintiffs.188 The court further reasoned that "[a]fter the expiration of the copyright, [the] creation becomes part of the public domain. In the case of a trademark, however, the process is reversed. An individual selects a word or design that 184. 510 F.2d 1004 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 868 (1975). 185.

Under the current Copyright Act, the logos should be protected as graphic images. 17 U.S.C. ? 101 (1988) (definition of "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work[s]"). 187.

Rogers Co. v. Keene, 778 F.2d 334, 340 (7th Cir. 1985) (finding Job's Daughters too restrictive and penalizing those who come up with creative trademarks). Despite this pronouncement, the court focused on the sale of the emblems to the public to show public allegiance or identification with a particular team. It specifically did not address "the concept of whether every artistic reproduction of the symbol would infringe upon plaintiffs' rights." Boston Hockey, 510 F.2d at 1011. However, in the fictional character arena, convergence will encourage courts to find that many, if not most, works violate mark-based rights. See the discussion of the Beatrix Potter case, notes 194-200 infra and accompanying text. 657</page><page sequence="36">STANFORD LAW REVIEW might otherwise be in the public domain to represent his business or prod- uct."189 If the mark acquires secondary meaning, the owner has a property right in that mark.190 The scope of protection against expressive uses of trademarks may be quite broad, in fact. In Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cin- ema, Ltd.,191 the court held: (1) the belief that a mark's owner sponsored or approved of a mark's use in an expressive work satisfied the confusion re- quirement for a ? 43(a) claim, and (2) mark-based laws protected reputa- tional interests. While defendants asserted that confusion must exist as to the film's origin and that no one would believe plaintiff had produced the film, the court took a more expansive approach: The public's belief that the mark's owner sponsored or otherwise approved the use of the trademark satisfies the confusion requirement. In the instant case, the uniform depicted in "Debbie Does Dallas" unquestionably brings to mind the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Indeed, it is hard to believe that anyone who had seen defendants' sexually depraved film could ever thereaf- ter disassociate it from plaintiff's cheerleaders.192 The court found that trademark laws not only protect consumers against confusion, but also protect the trademark owner's right to control the repu- tation of the "marked" product.193 These two cases add legal substance to an allegation that unauthorized expressive uses of a character mark (or components thereof, such as cos- tumes) infringe owners' rights. To this position is added the specific recogni- tion that public domain status does not strip a fictional character of its ability to function as an indicator of source. Frederick Warne &amp; Co. v. Book Sales, Inc. 94 allowed the owner of a public domain character to retain trademark rights in cover illustrations of several "Peter Rabbit" stories and in character marks adapted from the cov- ers.195 Warne claimed trademark infringement when Book Sales used its cover artwork on a repackaged edition of seven public domain stories.196 The court reasoned that a copyrightable character which clearly identi- fies the source of goods should not be excluded from trademark protection 189. Boston Hockey, 510 F.2d at 1014. 190. Id. Thus, one can argue that this reasoning allows for the owner of a character which has "just" entered the public domain to take back from the public domain those aspects of the character which are subject to trademark protection. The owner could then assert a right to use those aspects in source-indicating situations upon showing secondary meaning and likelihood of confusion. 191. 604 F.2d 200 (2d Cir. 1979) (use of costumes nearly identical to the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in the X-rated movie Debbie Does Dallas and its advertisements). 192.

The court noted that al- lowing protection under both copyright and trademark was particularly ap- propriate for pictorial characters, as they are often intended to identify the creator. 197 The court felt that the misrepresentation of the reprinted stories' source was very problematic.198 However, the court did not establish protection that would exist in perpetuity; it avoided the question of whether non-copy- right causes of action extended the copyright monopoly since "plaintiff [did] not seek to establish exclusive trademark rights in the characters themselves but only to protect its limited right to use specific illustrations of those char- acters."199 It further recognized the difficulty plaintiff faced in proving Peter Rabbit served as its trademark, rather than that of the author.200 197. Warne, 481 F. Supp. at 1196-97. See also note 188 supra and accompanying text. 198. If any of these illustrations, including the "sitting rabbit" design, has come to identify Warne publications, defendant's use of it may lead the public to believe that defendant's different, and allegedly inferior, publication has been published by or is somehow associ- ated with plaintiff. This kind of danger of misrepresentation as to the source of copied public domain material may establish a claim for unfair competition. Warne, 481 F. Supp. at 1197 (citation omitted). The court further reasoned: Nor is it clear that defendant's use of these illustrations is necessary to the full and effective exploitation of the public domain works .... And, contrary to what defendant contends, the cover illustrations are not analogous to titles of public domain works, which, Professor Nimmer suggests, may be essential to effective distribution of the works. Id. at 1198. 199. Id. at 1197 n.3. Judge Nies' special concurrence in In re DC Comics, Inc., 689 F.2d 1042, 1050 (C.C.P.A. 1982), also addressed the issue of whether the copyright monopoly is extended through trademark protection. A basic misconception ... is that registration or recognition as a trademark would secure perpetual rights in the doll design. Trademark rights can only be found to exist or not to exist at a particular point in time, and registration neither extends the period of one's right of exclusive use nor guarantees protection at any time in the future .... If others become entitled to use the designs upon the expiration of copyright protection, the contin- ued registration of the designs as trademarks may be addressed in the context of a conflict- ing claim of a right to use .... Id. at 1052 (emphasis in original). [T]here is a question whether the quid pro quo for the protection granted under the copy- right statute has been given, if, upon expiration of the copyright, the design cannot be used at all by others. Whether there should be a temporary, permanent, or no loss of trademark protection at that time must wait resolution in an appropriate case .... Id. at 1052 n.6 (emphasis in original). In terms of the conflicting claim, if the character is still in use at the time the copyright expires, it is highly likely that the character will have become associated with a particular source. The copyright owner, therefore, would have a superior claim in a trade- mark proceeding. 200. A title is generally the primary identifier of a literary work; the cover illustrations are not. Of course, as noted at the outset, if the illustrations merely identify Miss Potter and her works, plaintiff will have no claim to trademark protection. If, however, plaintiff can es- tablish a specialized secondary meaning-that the illustrations represent Warne's goodwill and reputation as the source of children's books and other products-it will have a protect- able trademark interest, except to the extent that the covers contain material necessary to identify the book itself.... The foregoing should not be construed to suggest that plaintiff will have an easy task at trial. Because the claimed marks are derived from or are similar in appearance to the illustrations in the text of the books, they may well prove to be "weak" marks.</page><page sequence="38">STANFORD LAW REVIEW 2. Will a parody utilizing a public domain character that functions as a trademark be permissible under a fair use analysis? If trademark and unfair competition extend quasi-copyright protection to public domain characters under convergence, what role will parody and fair use play? On the one hand, parodies of non-character trademarks are generally allowed if no confusion exists as to sponsorship or source.201 On the other hand, convergence allows claims against these works even when confusion as to sponsorship or source is questionable. The few character and pseudo-character trademark parody cases have been reluctant to find infringement. For example, in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co.,202 the court framed the issue by asking whether there was the likelihood of confusion as to source.203 The court upheld the lower court finding that "the King Kong mark lacked distinction and failed to identify the goods it represented as emanating from a particular source based upon its prior conclusion that King Kong lacked secondary meaning."204 Alleged infringement of a character that has always been a trademark is another interesting example. In Reddy Communications, Inc. v. Environ- mental Action Foundation,205 defendant's publication used plaintiff's car- toon "Reddy Kilowatt" character to portray utility companies negatively. Paying special attention to defendant's use of the character, the court found no likelihood of confusion. Similarly, the court in Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions,206 upheld a fair use defense for all but one cause of ac- tion.207 Although the court found that Milky Way took more than was nec- essary, it noted that plaintiff failed to show that defendant intended this use to fill the demand for the original. Because the parody product was not remotely related to the original and was sold in distinct retail outlets, the court felt that Milky Way was making light of Pillsbury's trademark and not intentionally deceiving the public. Non-character trademark cases involving parodies have also been reluc- Warne, 481 F. Supp. at 1198. 201. See, e.g., L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1013 (1987). 202. 746 F.2d 112 (2d Cir. 1984). The court stated that "'Donkey Kong[ ] ... [a video game character] create[s] a totally different concept and feel from the drama of King Kong' and that '[a]t best, Donkey Kong is a parody of King Kong.' Indeed, 'the fact that Donkey Kong so obviously parodies the King Kong theme strongly contributes to dispelling confusion on the part of consum- ers.' " Id. at 116 (citations omitted). 203. Id. at 115. 204. Id. at 116 n.5. 205. 477 F. Supp. 936 (D.D.C. 1979). 206. 8 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981) (defendant publishers of Screw produced an issue which contained pictures of characters looking like plaintiff's marks, "Poppin' Fresh" doughboy and "Poppy Fresh" doughgirl, engaged in sexual intercourse). 207. Pillsbury lost on claims of infringement of copyrights, federal and common law trade- mark, the state deceptive trade practice act, and on several counts of tortious tarnishment of plain- tiff's marketing, trade character, and jingle. However, the court did find infringement under the state antidilution statute. Id. This may point to either the influence of convergence in general, vis-a- vis finding some protection for a "disparaged" character, or to the overly broad sweep of the dilution cause of action, if not to some degree of both. [Vol. 44:623 660</page><page sequence="39">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS tant to find infringement. For example, Tetley, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc.208 found that satirically depicted retail packages of various mass-mar- keted commercial products on trading card type stickers were not infringing. Specifically, the court found that the stickers were broadly "punned" adap- tations of the trademarks, thus differentiating the trademarks and the stick- ers. And in L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers Inc.,209 the court found that the trademark owner's rights extended only to injurious, unauthorized com- mercial uses of the mark by another. Because convergence causes courts to consider public domain characters' copyrighted "pasts," cases that found trademark parodies to be infringing may be dangerous precedents. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. v. Novak 210 found that plaintiff's property rights did not yield to defendant's parody "Mutant of Omaha," which was used to make a statement about nuclear war. Where adequate, alternative avenues of communication existed, de- fendant had no First Amendment defense.211 This case may be differenti- ated on the ground that surveys revealed incidents of actual confusion. More troubling is Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc.212 Here defendant's "Garbage Pail Kids" trading cards, despite the obvious parody of plaintiff's "Cabbage Patch Kids," were found to be confused with and to impugn the dolls while also injuring the corporation.213 Thus, if one utilizes the mark to parody the trademark or the source itself, rather than to evoke an unrelated message, the court is less likely to find infringement. When the mark is a character, however, courts appear more likely to find confusion, even if the defendant's work is an obvious parody. Absent confusion, a parodied character may be tarnished, thus sup- porting a dilution claim. While the majority of cases imply that parodists may use character marks liberally, this liberty is available only so long as the laws are not quasi-copyright. If convergence succeeds, then lack of confu- sion as to source is no longer enough to permit the use. Rather, the analysis will become more like that in Appalachian Artworks, where reputation of the mark itself, rather than the owner of the mark, is relevant. 208. 556 F. Supp. 785 (E.D.N.Y. 1983); see also Universal City Studios, Inc. v. T-Shirt Gal- lery, Ltd., 634 F.

P1: AFFIRMING PUBLIC POLICY BY REASSERTING DOCTRINAL BOUNDARIES WHILE RETAINING MEANINGFUL PROTECTION Convergence is breaking down the barriers between the causes of action used to protect fictional characters, despite the divergent balances and trade- offs underlying these theories.24 If trademark and unfair competition be- come parallel to copyright, two results can be expected. First, character owners will gain control over and profit from character uses not granted exclusively to them by the appropriate statutes. While this does not seem problematic in cases of egregious infringement, areas carved out of these exclusive rights, most notably fair use, will be prohibited. Second, a charac- ter's public domain status will mean little, if anything, when that character is unavailable to nonowners for new expressive works. This may, in fact, ex- tend the copyright monopoly indefinitely. Therefore, the courts must rea- sonably and carefully limit protection for public domain characters when they are used in a copyright fashion.215 Moreover, courts must reaffirm the intent and goals behind each doctrine to limit the convergence of these theo- ries such that the loss of copyright has a qualitative result. A. Addressing the Doctrinal Breakdown Courts should not wait until they are addressing public domain charac- ters before they return to articulating and employing specific requirements for each intellectual property cause of action. The concern is to not allow convergence to overextend protection while, at the same time, not allowing fear of convergence to undercut it. This does not mean that courts should use the "Sam Spade" standard to prevent characters from obtaining copy- right protection.216 Rather, courts should recognize that a character can, in fact, function as both a mark and an expressive unit, and hence seek protec- tion under the full panoply of intellectual property laws. But within this context, courts must carefully evaluate the particular situation to determine what types of uses are being made of the character. For trademark purposes, courts should evaluate a character in terms of its approach to non-character marks. For copyright, the evaluation must be without regard to how famous the character is or how well it is developed, but rather to what extent an alleged infringer has taken similar or identical expression comprising the character. Such an approach is the necessary 214. See notes 33-84 supra and accompanying text. 215. Commentators list different ways in which public-domain status should restrict the pro- tection afforded characters. On one end of the spectrum, public domain is seen as meaning nothing more than the right to re-publish those works that no longer carry a valid copyright. The unauthor- ized use of public domain characters in new works is viewed as inherently confusing to the general public, and therefore prohibited. On the other end of the spectrum, public domain is seen as al- lowing a character to be used by anyone, in any new work, in all but the rarest situations. In between is a suggestion that either public domain status allows a character to be used in new works, provided steps are taken to make sure there is no confusion as to whether the new work came from the original source, or that some aspects of the character can be freely copied while others can be protected as trademarks. 216. See notes 46-54 supra and accompanying text. [Vol. 44:623 662</page><page sequence="41">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS safeguard against the permanent fusion of these causes of action. Preventing this merging ensures that rights not guaranteed by the exclusive rights of a trademark or copyright owner are available for all to use. Plaintiffs should be free to allege the full range of intellectual property causes of action for two basic reasons. First, defendant's actions might actu- ally infringe all of these exclusive rights. Second, this practice has not caused convergence; rather, it is the judiciary that is responsible for conver- gence by failing to treat and analyze each claim separately. B. Validity of Considering Likelihood of Confusion The claim that characters are not "purchased" because the consumer is pleased with a previously purchased product, but solely because he or she likes the character,217 is much too narrow a view of consumer motivation. Character-based products comprise not only characters' own indicia and personalities, but also their limitations, idiosyncratic mannerisms, relation- ships, and histories that have developed over time. Hence, consumers are likely to buy a character mark because of the continuity in storyline guaran- teed by purchasing from the same source.218 Moreover, the consumer may be interested in the interplay among characters of different works created or sponsored by the same source. When a character passes into the public domain, the reality of the mar- ketplace and psychological associations between a character and its source219 remain intact. Even if the law will not protect the mark from in- fringers, the result is a mark in fact if not in law. Recall the court's analysis in Fisher v. Star Co.: "The figures and names have been so connected with [Fisher] as their originator or author, that the use by another of new cartoons exploiting the characters 'Mutt' and 'Jeff' would be unfair to the public and to the plaintiff."220 217. Shapiro, supra note 71, at 94 n.110. 218. A character name or visual appearance can properly serve as an indication of source even if it is attached solely to the work in which it appears, although the lack of use on other goods or services will certainly reflect on the ability of the character to acquire a provable level of secondary meaning. See In re DC Comics, Inc., 689 F.2d 1042 (C.C.P.A. 1982). Specifically, A well-known character is analogous to a trademark. Indeed, considering its essential significance, it is a trademark. A certain character, which has appeared in a series of sto- ries, radio or television programs, comic strips or motion picures [sic], signifies to the pub- lic that it is the product of the creator of the works which previously used that character.... The important thing is that the people associate the symbol with the prod- uct. There is no less reason why the character of a series of works . . . does not declare to the viewer or reader that it is the product of the same creator. Waldheim, supra note 96, at 217 (emphasis in original). 219. See note 75 supra. 220. 231 N.Y. 414, 433 (emphasis added); see notes 171-179 supra and accompanying text. [W]hen the character in [a] story has become a means of identification of a series of stories emanating from the same creator, the character then has become a trademark.... The appropriation of someone else's well-known character in a new work has the same effect as the use of another's trademark-and such characters may be protected from kidnapping. Waldheim, supra note 96, at 218 (however, creator or assignee must be viewed as the source of the goods or services featuring the character); see also Note, supra note 33, at 351. 663</page><page sequence="42">664 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 When a source has developed goodwill in its goods or services, perhaps for 50 or more years, the public relies on the mark for assurance of the same quality, whatever that quality may be, thus supporting economic effi- ciency.221 Allowing a character's passage into the public domain to extin- guish all rights undervalues trademark's economic and public policy rationales.222 Importantly, while the basic features of the characters are still available for the creation of new works, "copyright uses" are now available to the public for these characters. There is a no good reason, therefore, why other sources would require the character or its name for trademark or ser- vice mark purposes223 where they have not previously used the marks.224 Once in the public domain the rights in a character must conform to those afforded non-character marks.225 As the court recognized in Ideal Toy 221. See generally Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 18. 222. Frank Waldheim, on one side of the spectrum, argues: When the copyright expires in a work using a certain character, anyone is free to reproduce that work. But to write and publish a new work utilizing the character is another matter. The public will assume that the new work emanates from the creator of the original work-and thus the public is misled and the original creator is deprived of good will and property rights belonging to him. Waldheim, supra note 96, at 217. 223. Holding the "copyright use" questions aside, in terms of others using the character as pure mark, the situation is no different than with non-character marks. Just as there is no reason why another soda producer needs to call her product "Coca Cola," a car manufacturer to call his product "Rolls Royce," or a telecommunications concern to advertise "Let your fingers do the walk- ing," there is no clear reason why a non-Walt Disney company needs to use labels or packaging featuring Mickey Mouse to sell their wares or services. 224. Two commentators share the view that protection should be afforded to characters using a "duality approach" first suggested by E. Fulton Brylawski: Under the duality approach, a characterization if protectible would only enjoy protec- tion for the term of copyright on the work in which the characterization originally ap- peared, expiring with the copyright on such work .... Upon the lapse of copyright protection, the configuration or pictorial representation of a cartoon character or the verbal portrait of a literary character could be re-created, imitated or otherwise copied by anyone as long as he adopts a different character name. Brylawski, supra note 2, at 96 (footnote omitted). Thus, that aspect of a character which was never a subject of copyright, the name, retains the only kind of legal protection it should have had during the copyright term-under the laws of trademark and unfair competition. Protection of the name, true to trademark doctrine, would exist indefinitely, "thereby providing a certain flexibility and adaptability to those situations that might arouse the court's conscience without at the same time creating bad case law or confusion with copyright doctrine." Id.; see also Marks, supra note 44, at 88 (for a second commentary agreeing with Brylawski). Take note of Brylawski's concern with the creation of "bad case law" from intermingling copy- right doctrine with that of trademark in the area of name protection, a situation which has now arisen as a result of convergence. Placing particular importance on associating the name with the author, Brylawski is concerned with extending the protection beyond the life of the author. He establishes the rule that the trademark ends upon the death of the author, but then adds three exceptions. The first is when the work is deemed to be that of the author's employer, under the work-for-hire doctrine, the second when the author's successors continue the use of the character name in new works, and the third when the character has appeared in a series of works, and these works are continually exploited by the author's heirs, lest "the value of the author's remaining copy- rights . . . be substantially impaired where others are permitted to utilize his character names," Brylawski, supra note 2, at 99. See also id. at 98-100. 225. Commentator Roger L. Zissu would extend protection at least to the character name for as long as there is no "abandonment of character rights by its owners." Zissu, supra note 2, at 136. In other words, continued commercial licensing of the character would enable the owner of the "now" public domain character to prevent its use by others, at least to the same degree that its use is</page><page sequence="43">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS 665 Corp.,226 "in evaluating the unfair competition claim the Court must ... determine whether [the alleged infringer], by the entirety of its merchandis- ing efforts, has attempted to mislead the public into thinking that its toys were 'sponsored' by [the mark owner] or derived from it."227 Additionally, to establish unfair competition the mark must emanate from a single source.228 Lack of a clear source makes it uncertain that the character is truly a mark.229 The court in Frederick Warne &amp; Co. recog- nized this when it found Warne would have to prove that consumers associ- ated the characters with the publisher, rather than the author. Otherwise, Warne's goodwill and reputation could not be impeached by others using the same characters.230 Because the rights to the character King Kong were divided among a number of companies, including RKO, Dino De Laurentis Corp., and Universal, the court in Nintendo could not find that the mark indicated a single source.231 C. Copyright Monopoly Lost, Trademark Retained Public domain status should require that the character232 be available for copyright uses. Because copyright and mark-based laws pursue divergent goals, the loss of copyright protection should result in lessened exclusive rights that reflect the goals of intellectual property law. Trademark and un- fair competition cannot substitute for the greatly diminished protection previously limited by copyright, trademark, and unfair competition laws. Note how no differentia- tion is made between purely "copyright" merchandise-Waldheim's Donald Duck pail-and mer- chandise where the character, at least arguably, serves a "true" trademark purpose-Waldheim's Mickey Mouse on a pair of socks. On the other hand, "in the case of characters from works of vintage which have come to be regarded as classics, the public domain would ordinarily have taken its toll as a result of the absence of licensing activity or use by the owners over a number of generations." Id. In the event that judicial action results in a set limit to the term of protection, Zissu would have the "otherwise privileged use after the cutoff period of the same named character in sequels or new stories by third parties ... accompanied by a disclaimer of the original authorship." Id. at 137. Thus, it doesn't matter that copyright carries no required showing of confusion. Now, just such a showing is crucial to a finding of infringement. 226. Ideal Toy Corp. v. Kenner Products Div. of General Mills Fun Group, Inc., 443 F. Supp. 291 (S.D.N.Y. 1977). 227. Id. at 307. 228. See generally Kurtz, supra note 2, at 485-89 (discussing the "fallacy" that a fictional char- acter is always associated in the public mind with a single source). 229. See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., 746 F.2d 112, 116 n.5 (2d Cir. 1984) (noting the lower court's finding "that the King Kong mark lacked distinction and failed to identify goods it represented as emanating from a particular source"). 230.

Nintendo Co., 746 F.2d 112 (2d Cir. 1984) (each interest had separately produced works utilizing the character). 232. Logos and related indicia of characters, such as the "S" on Superman's chest, Bugs Bunny's "What's up Doc?," or the distinctive masks of Spider-Man and Batman, should be trade- marks if they have been used during the copyright term as indicators of source and origin. For example, Marvel comics often carry a stylized logo of Spider-Man's mask in place of the U.P.C. bar code. These indicia become associated both with the characters and the goods and services in which they appear. Thus, for nonexpressive uses, they are treated like any noncharacter mark. Use of indicia such as a character's customary traits after the character has entered the public domain should not be barred where the use is necessary to the expression of the character.</page><page sequence="44">666 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 against unauthorized expressive or ornamental uses.233 In this way, the law achieves the purposes of the Copyright Act's public domain provisions.234 The right to use public domain characters is even stronger in parodies or social commentaries. The law permits these uses in most circumstances de- spite a valid copyright.235 More importantly, because parody inherently works to dispel consumer confusion by differentiating itself from the original work, the use is unlikely to infringe a character mark.236 There is no reason to conclude that a character that falls into the public domain for copyright purposes can no longer be used as a mark.237 In fact, trademark specifically operates to take words and designs out of the public domain.238 Trademarks serve the public's need to distinguish goods and services. 233. See 2 P. GOLDSTEIN, supra note 23, ? 15.14.1, at 570 n.55. 234. See generally Shapiro, supra note 71, at 73-79 (discussing policy issues regarding the right to copy works in the public domain). 235. See note 32 supra. 236. See, e.g., Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., 746 F.2d 112, 116 (2d Cir. 1984); Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions, 8 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1016, 1022-23 (N.D. Ga. 1981). 237. For an analogy to trademark protection for an expired design patent, see In re Mogen David Wine Corp., 372 F.2d 539 (C.C.P.A. 1967) (bottle configuration was not per se incapable of being registered as a trademark simply because it had previously been protected by a design patent). See also, 2 P. GOLDSTEIN, supra note 23, ? 15.14.1, at 570 n.55: As a general rule, the fact that a work is in the public domain for purposes of one intellectual property regime, such as copyright or patent law, does not necessarily mean that it is in the public domain for the purposes of another intellectual property regime, such as unfair competition or trademark law.... The rationale for this rule is that, since different intellectual property laws serve distinct objects, each should receive full force within its respective domain. Peter Shapiro, on the other hand, would establish a general rule that no protection extends to a character once it enters the public domain. He argues that attempts to use a trademark consisting of a character's name and configuration as a way to prevent the use of that public domain character in "copyright" uses is invalid, as trademark is intended "to distinguish and identify goods or services; it is not intended to protect against appropriation of the product or the literary property of a work." Shapiro, supra note 71, at 96 (citation omitted). For the same reason, one cannot use trademark to prevent the use of a character on merchandise where it functions as the "primary selling point." On the other hand, Shapiro would shift the balance in favor of the first user if the character is used to represent goods or services unrelated to the "nature of the character," or when confusion arises from use of the same or confusingly similar mark on another "neutral" good or service. This would prevent "consumer deception, mistake, or confusion." Id. at 96-97. Use of the character trademark as a mark on even neutral goods may not prevent "artistic uses" of the character. Despite the potential for dilution of the mark, or confusion as to sponsorship or authorization, "the merchant's attempt to assert his rights outside the purely commercial field is defeated by the strong public domain policy of free use of copyrighted material. The merchant might be held to have exposed himself to this risk by adopting a character not within his exclusive control as his mark." Id. at 97-98. Shapiro's argument has less force where the mark's owner was also the owner of the copyright before it fell into the public domain, and, therefore, when the mark was first put on products and services its owner did have exclusive control of the character mark. Shapiro would require labeling to protect the trademark owner's "legitimate interest in maintaining the good will attributable to his business" with an injunction limited to "particularly egregious cases of passing off or where the secondary meaning is extremely strong." Id. at 102. While he takes exception to Waldheim's approach, see id. at 93-95, which focuses on Walt Disney characters, Sha- piro notes that "Walt Disney's association with his characters, and perhaps Charles Schultz's with his, spring to mind as cases of extremely strong secondary meaning."

Dallas Cap &amp; Emblem Mfg., Inc., 510 F.2d at 1010- 11.</page><page sequence="45">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS Because trademark laws allow public domain words or designs to become indicators of origin, it follows that falling into the public domain does not automatically extinguish all rights in a character. Importantly, trademark does not take the character out of the public domain for all purposes, but only for those uses that serve identifying functions, and then only where plaintiff is able to prove both secondary meaning and likelihood of confusion. D. Copyright Uses Versus Trademark Uses Hard questions remain concerning the boundaries of copyright uses and trademark uses.239 For example, does the use of a character on a product function as copyright adornment, trademark identification of source and quality, or both? Also, should otherwise permissible uses and their market- ing be restricted if there is a high likelihood of misleading the public? At the heart of this problem is a lack of distinction between copyright and trademark uses of fictional characters. It is unclear just what use of a character implicates designation of origin and what more properly utilizes expressive elements. "When [a] copyrighted character is used in such a way that it becomes something more than an adornment of the article but sug- gests to the purchaser that the article comes from a certain source, the char- acter then achieves a trademark significance."240 While customers may initially be attracted to the appearance of the character, even without a qual- ity inference, the difficult analysis will still arise with subsequent purchases. Does the character maintain its status as simply a decoration, or has the decoration come to represent the article's manufacturer? If the former, the court can apply a copyright analysis alone. If the latter, the court will need to consider trademark analysis as well.241 1. Presumption of mere adornment. Once a character used for indicative and expressive functions falls into the public domain, it should be treated as were the team logos in Boston Hockey. Allowing trademark protection against expressive uses of the logos, the court based its decision on three points: (1) the commercial value of the emblems derived from the plaintiffs' efforts; (2) defendant was seeking the "exclusive right to make and sell" the marks as embodied in emblems; and (3) the sale of the mark as an emblem was "an accepted use of such team symbols in connection with the type of activity in which the business of pro- 239. Some uses may easily be defined as either copyright or trademark uses. A character in a new story is clearly a copyright use. A single representation of a character placed upon labels, tags, or packaging used to market a product or service not directly related to the character is clearly a trademark use. 240. Waldheim, supra note 95, at 866. If the character has been carefully crafted, and the quality of the works in which it appears has been maintained, then, in the public mind, this quality is transferred to a good or service and becomes the reason to purchase the good or service. 241. See id. at 867. 667</page><page sequence="46">STANFORD LAW REVIEW fessional sports is engaged."242 The first factor favors the plaintiff, provided the character was, in fact, sufficiently commercially exploited prior to the alleged infringing acts. The second factor is obviously case specific; the closer this is supported by the facts, the stronger the plaintiff's case. The third factor logically goes to likelihood of confusion-the closer the fit be- tween the alleged infringing act and past uses of the character mark by the plaintiff, the higher the probability of consumer confusion. Within this framework, courts should presume that the use is adornment when the character appears on the actual product itself rather than the label, tag, or packaging.243 Character merchandising is the prime example. Con- sumers buy the product because of the character rather than the manufac- turer.244 Once copyright no longer protects such use, the burden is on the plaintiff to overcome the presumption of adornment and prove that a signifi- cant number of consumers utilize the character as a true trademark.245 For example, if consumers who bought a shirt emblazoned with a depiction of Superman or Batman are less likely to purchase the same shirt when the identical depiction appears only on the sales label or collar tag,246 the use of the mark on the shirt is mere adornment. In that case, the presumption prevents mark-based laws from preventing purely expressive uses. However, if plaintiff can prove that, as between two otherwise identical shirts, one with and one without the imprinted character, customers: (1) utilize the charac- ter's presence as an assurance of quality, regardless of its expressive qualities, and (2) believe the expressive use denotes source or approval of use, a court can require a defendant to alter its product marketing to eliminate consumer confusion.247 Failure or inability to eliminate the confusion may lead to 242. Boston Hockey, 510 F.2d at 1011. 243. One commentator expresses the view that the recognition of the character by the public does not necessarily equate to confusion as to source. See Kurtz, supra note 2, at 502-04. But, to a significant degree the public does associate the exploitation of a character with the ultimate authori- zation of a source, however anonymous it is. 244. Waldheim, supra note 95, at 866-67. 245. The fact that some purchasers want the "name brand" appeal of having the trademark on the product, for instance Levi's red tag on the back pocket of jeans, should not detract from that use being a trademark use. The issue is whether the consumer buys the product because of the source. Whether the consumer wants Levi's jeans because he likes the quality of the product or because the consumer wants others to know that he wears that particular brand is irrelevant to the trademark analysis. In both cases, the keystone remains source. On the other hand, if the purchase was made because of the appeal of the back pocket's red tag, alone, and any jeans produced with a similar tag are treated as fungible by the public, then the tag does little in terms of being a trademark. 246. The appearance of a character on the front of the garment in a manner similar to the Izod alligator logo may well be a permissible trademark use. Depending on the actual configuration of the character logo, however, this might trigger the presumption of mere adornment. 247. See note 258 infra and accompanying text. However, note one commentator's view toward merchandising: Those who create fictional characters do not possess an inalienable right to capture the market for lunchboxes, mugs, T-shirts and toys. The assumption that public recognition is equivalent to a likelihood of confusion is unwarranted. Even if the defendant's merchan- dise is associated with the plaintiff's character or the work in which it appeared, there may be no confusion as to its source. It cannot be assumed that consumers believe any use of a well-known character means its creators sponsored or approved of it. Kurtz, supra note 2, at 502-03 (footnotes omitted). Cf Note, supra note 33, at 350-51 (any use of a 668 [Vol. 44:623</page><page sequence="47">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS more severe judicial remedies.248 2. Use of character names. Character names can be used in new works.249 Allowing this use is con- sistent with allowing reprinting of public domain works in their entirety, including titles.250 While the use in that situation is to prevent confusion,251 here the use maintains expressive integrity without denying the new use of other means to prevent confusion. This approach ignores neither that names are the focus of trademark laws nor that the use of the name can lead to problems of passing off.252 Rather, these concerns require a court to review expressive works for trademark and unfair competition violations by exam- ining the defendant's marketing strategies and the physical configuration of the packaging. E. Affirmative Actions to Prevent Likelihood of Confusion An obvious problem is that the marketing and sale of post-public domain expressive works may create confusion as to source or authorization. Two likely sources of this confusion exist: (1) even with the expiration of copy- right, the public will for a time continue to associate works featuring a well- known character with the previous copyright owner; and (2) continued use of the character mark on non-character products or services reinforces con- sumers' association of the "character as mark" with the mark owner. 1. Determining when affirmative actions are available. Unless the plaintiff proves secondary meaning and likelihood of confu- sion, a court should not enforce remedial measures.253 Focusing on confu- sion caused by marketing and packaging of legal "unauthorized" works, the strength of the mark will determine the level of showing necessary. The traditional rule that a strong, inherently distinctive mark254 does not require a showing of secondary meaning still applies. Pictorial characters, and in some cases character names, can be considered strong marks. In the absence of a trademark use, however, one might question their inherent registered character name might confuse the public as to source). One can question how Kurtz would respond if the public assumption of authorization were proven. See also note 188 supra and accompanying text. 248. See notes 259-263 infra and accompanying text. 249. But see note 224 supra ("duality approach" to character protection). 250. See 1 P. GOLDSTEIN, supra note 23, ? 15.14.1, at 568-69. 251. Id. ? 15.14.1, at 569 ("The competitor's privilege in this case stems, however, not from the fact that the work has fallen into the public domain, but rather from the fact that... the plaintiff will have no action for passing off since the title is the generic term by which consumers describe the work."). 252. See id. ? 15.14.1, at 568-69. See generally Leslie A. Kurtz, Protectionfor Titles of Literary Works in the Public Domain, 37 RUTGERS L. REV. 53 (1984) (addressing the legal protection avail- able for titles). 253. Without the likelihood of confusion, there is no reason to burden the user of a public domain character with the responsibility of distinguishing the new work. 254. See note 75 supra. 669</page><page sequence="48">670 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 44:623 strength. Through exclusive and extensive use, a character may well become a strong mark by the time the copyright lapses. The extensive merchandising and advertising of some characters will cause consumers to associate the most "famous" characters with a particular source. Provided the rights are not significantly fractionalized during the copyright term, one can regard these characters as strong marks. For such strong marks, the standard argu- ments for protection require that the marketing of otherwise permissible works include actions to prevent confusion.255 Similarly, characters and character names can be weak marks and suffer the same fate as their non-character counterparts. Where only a small number of people recognize the mark,256 or attribute it to a particular source, little chance of confusion exists. Where an owner has not fully ex- ploited a character, it likely appears only with stronger marks.257 Similarly, without a clear and convincing showing of passing off or confusion, market- ing a product with a weak character mark will probably not require the alleged infringer to take proactive steps. 2. Measures to prevent confusion by marketing efforts. Notwithstanding the freedom to use public domain characters in new works, likelihood of confusion requires preventative actions. In these situa- tions, new users must employ labels or disclaimers to disclose that the new work is not written, drawn, authorized, or sponsored by the original author, the entity which owned the copyright in the character before it expired, and/ or the entity that currently has the trademark rights in the character.258 While such disclaimers will often not eliminate all confusion-especially 255. See generally Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 18 (analyzing trademark law and the promo- tion of economic efficiency). 256. See, e.g., Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, Inc., 875 F.2d 1026 (2d Cir. 1989); Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Romulan Invasions, 7 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1897 (TTAB 1988) (dismissed opposition filed against the registration of "The Romulans" for entertainment services of a rock music group, finding Paramount's use of "The Romulan" mark to be limited to model space ships and little danger of consumer confusion). 257. For example, DC Comics utilizes the registered design mark, "DC Bullet," on its comic books, while Marvel Comics Group uses a registered, over-sized "M" logo. When characters and/ or their names appear on the front of a particular book in conjunction with these "corporate marks," one can question whether customers rely on anything other than the presence of the corporate marks and the presence of a very well-known character. The obvious implication is that, but for the most extensively utilized and "well recognized" characters, other characters, even if sometimes used, may properly be considered weak marks. 258. Leslie A. Kurtz argues: "When a work of fiction is in the public domain, anyone should be permitted to use its characters, including their names and images, in new works of fiction, if they use labelling or disclaiming language to disclose that the new work is not written or authorized by the original author." Kurtz, supra note 2, at 520; see also Zissu, supra note 2, at 137 (arguing that new users should provide disclaimers of original authorship); Shapiro, supra note 71, at 95, 102 (advocating the use of labelling by new users). Kurtz recognizes that "distinguishing language will be less effective in protecting against public confusion and preserving good will than forbidding the use of a character. Such a prohibition, however, not only diminishes the creative pool from which all artists must draw, but does so for an unlimited period of time." Kurtz, supra note 2, at 521. In addition to new works of fiction, public domain characters would also be permitted on merchandise. In any case, if the character, or elements of the character, functions as a true trademark, used solely to designate origin, then the fact that the mark comes from the public domain is irrelevant.</page><page sequence="49">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS where consumers are either children or unattentive-an injunction against expressive use will go too far in all but the rarest case. A disclaimer pro- motes the character's strength as a mark; the "legitimate" mark's lack of a disclaimer will, in effect, state: "This is an official or original product/ser- vice." The use of disclaimers also protects both corporate goodwill and con- sumers. Customers will rely on an "official" mark to determine which works continue from those produced during the period of copyright exclusivity, and hence utilize the full range of characters and relationships found in de- rivative works. 3. Exception to liberal expressive and ornamental use. Labeling will not be enough in a few rare situations; in these cases, ex- pressive uses will have to be curtailed. An example of the inadequacy of labelling is where the character is synonymous with its source. The associa- tion of the character with its source is "hard wired" in the public conscious- ness. This absolute association between character and owner will arise where: (1) a single source uses the character both in expressive works and for trademark purposes during most, if not all, of its copyright term; (2) such use continues after the character enters the public domain; (3) the owner reviews any licensing quality; and (4) the owner polices the mark. The clearest example of this phenomenon is Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, and possibly a few other prominent Disney characters. Disney uses Mickey Mouse extensively on such basic corporate materials as letterhead and envelopes; the character sometimes even stands in place of the corporate name.259 A poignant example of Mickey's pervasive use by Disney was his appearance in a full page advertisement paying tribute to the late Jim Hen- son. The advertisement consisted of the name Jim Henson, the dates 1936- 1990, and a formally dressed Mickey Mouse, with a tear in his eye.260 A second example may be the few most prominent characters from the "Pea- nuts gang" by Charles Schultz.261 Why put limits on expressive use? The mere presence of these characters is enough, even for ornamental uses sporting disclaiming language, to evoke an association with the mark owner due to the societal "hard wired" reac- 259. See The Walt Disney Co. v. Best, Copyright L. Rep. (CCH) ? 26,637, at 23,797 (S.D.N.Y. Sep. 24, 1990) ("Mickey Mouse is more than just an animated cartoon character; he has become the most recognizable symbol of Walt Disney."). 260. N.Y. TIMES, May 22, 1990, at B14. 261. See Shapiro, supra note 71, at 102 n.131 (these characters viewed as having "extremely strong secondary meaning"). It is perhaps telling that these characters are closely associated with either the individual "creator," or the business that was begun by the originator. Further, the char- acters have not been subject to sales by the owning individual or entity. Additionally, both are infrequently used in conjunction with other identifying marks that might dilute their ability to stand alone as indicators of source and quality. One can argue that the "Cat in the Hat" by Dr. Seuss would fit into this category if the artist/writer is the true source and controls quality. Most promi- nent comic book and cartoon characters, including Batman, Superman, Spider-man, and Bugs Bunny would also be contenders for such treatment, with the controlling corporate entity as the represented source. 671</page><page sequence="50">STANFORD LAW REVIEW tion.262 While such recognition, alone, may seem an insufficient justification for this proposed exception, remember that prototypical features are avail- able for public use. While Mickey Mouse may not be duplicated, another cute, humanized mouse can be newly authored, or the owner can license the original. The issue is tougher where a writer uses a character in a new work and not as a mark or for mere ornamentation. If the writer passes off the new work as that of the mark owner, the distinguishing language being insuffi- cient, a court can enjoin the work. However, if the author makes an attempt to distinguish the product or service, but the efforts prove fruitless, then the scale should tip in favor of trademark considerations and protection of the consuming public. While an injunction seems harsh, the author can use sim- ilar characters that the public does not recognize as the original.263 Further- more, the author can employ these similar characters in conjunction with other public domain characters from the same originator that do not have the same degree of secondary meaning. Another situation that would trigger requirements of disclaimers and la- beling, but without the potential bar on use, is where the character functions as a certification mark. Examples are the prominent characters from Sesame Street, if plaintiff could show that consumers rely on the characters' presence to "certify" that the product is appropriate for children. In this situation, strict differentiation prevents losing the certification quality. In terms of or- namental use, however, the use is presumed to be permissible.264 F. Limitation on Dilution Arguably, a dilution cause of action should not stand with regard to a public domain character because of the action's overinclusiveness. Take note of the concerns that kept Congress from adding dilution to the Lanham Act,265 and what happens when broad state antidilution actions get linked to convergence reasoning.266 If expressive uses are permitted, and labeling is used in those situations where there might otherwise be confusion, then dilu- tion is too risky. If dilution applies at all, it should apply only in those cases where three conditions exist. First, an unauthorized trademark use of the character must exist. Second, the distinguishing language must be insufficient to prevent 262. The potential for confusion or mistake is more likely where, like the Disney characters, they are used not only on goods and services throughout theme parks but are also sold in company owned retail shops. See, e.g., Stevenson, supra note 12. 263. Realistically, a situation such as this will rarely arise. Also, once the character no longer comes from a single source, this limitation on use is lost. 264. See text accompanying notes 243-247 supra. 265. Concerns include dilution actions preventing the use of trademarks in comparative adver- tising, satire, consumer reporting, editorial comment and other First Amendment uses involving trademarks. See note 88 supra. 266. See, e.g., DC Comics, Inc. v. Unlimited Monkey Business, Inc., 598 F. Supp. 110, 118 (N.D. Ga. 1984) (crafting "copyright dilution"); Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions, 8 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1016 (N.D. Ga. 1981). 672 [Vol. 44:623</page><page sequence="51">February 1992] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS confusion. And third, the continued use of the character must dilute its dis- tinctiveness and value as a mark. While this analysis may, in effect, create a special "public domain exception" to the dilution cause of action, any other approach would pervert the whole idea of public domain characters losing their copyright protection. Given the tendency of courts to consider dispar- agement of the character's own reputation, courts should require that any claim of dilution have a reasonable likelihood of satisfying the three previ- ously mentioned conditions.267 CONCLUSION It is difficult to argue with the change in judicial thinking that recognized the value of fictional characters and granted them comprehensive protection. However, it is not hard to critique the way in which the courts have ex- pressed this change. While recognizing that characters could perform both expressive and information-providing functions, courts have failed to sepa- rately analyze these roles. Rather, they have merged tests, reasoning, and language to yield a single, amorphous approach to character infringement actions. This approach, if left unchecked, will ultimately dilute the signifi- cance of a limited copyright term and hence make fewer characters available for "unauthorized" expressive uses. It also perverts the goals of trademark and unfair competition law by ignoring the likelihood of consumer confu- sion, and instead focusing solely on whether the character is similar, or per- haps if the character's reputation is harmed by the unauthorized use. It is possible, however, to offer characters extensive protection, similar to non-character marks and expressive works, without succumbing to conver- gence. Under the proposed approach, one analyzes characters separately as marks and as copyrighted expression. Issues such as public recognition, dis- paragement, the degree and similarity of the expression taken, and purpose of use are tied to their respective causes of action; where one of these issues applies to both causes of action, the court reviews them separately with re- spect to the divergent goals of each law. Where copyright is no longer available for a character, mark-based laws might still apply but should not prevent expressive uses except in the rarest of situations. Instead, after determining whether the use is ornamental or if it indicates source, the court should treat the mark-based claims no differ- ently than if a non-character mark was involved. In such a regime, conver- gence is valid only in the rare cases where a character retains beyond its 267. See Warner Bros., Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 720 F.2d 231, 248 (2d Cir. 1983) ("Even if Superman's trademarks are not as indestructible as the character that spawned them, no reasonable jury could find that the [Greatest American Hero television] series or 'promos' blurred or tarnished those marks."); Toho Co. v.
