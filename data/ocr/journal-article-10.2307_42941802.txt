<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 1 EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION: REDISCOVERING THE HEBREW BIBLE AS LITERATURE by Stan Goldman Stan Goldman is Assistant Professor of American literature at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. Interested in the intertextual conversation between Herman Melville's poetry and the Bible, he is the author of Melville's Protest Theism: The Hidden and Silent God in Ciarei (Northern Illinois University Press, 1993). "Narrative and Ethical Ironies in Esther" {Journal for the Study of the Old Testament, June 1990) and "Sacrifices to the Hidden God: Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek and Leviticus" {Soundings y Spring 1991) are recent publications. Three personal experiences have given rise to this special issue of Shofar. My rediscovery of the Hebrew Bible's textual unity is inseparable from my remembered experiences, what theoreticians of autobiography call my textual identity. First, after studying in both Jewish and Christian seminaries, I realized that I received the Hebrew Bible only at second hand. I knew biblical prooftexts from talmudic discussions and even from Hasidic works such as the Tanya , but not from the Bible. In many ways, graduate study i nyeshivot and in Christian seminaries avoids the study of biblical texts in favor of post-biblical criticism, whether the Talmud or historical-critical scholarship. In theyeshivah, the Tanakh was condescend- ingly associated with Hebrew school- frustrated Sunday-school moms and belligerent boys kept after public school. The Talmud, however, was associated with postdoctoral work- the intellectual rigor of halacha. Works of biblical criticism and talmudic commentary were taken as rivaling in importance, even supplanting, the biblical texts they interpreted. But the play's the thing, not the commentaries thereon. From synagogue attendance, I knew my weekly Sabbath readings of biblical texts from the Torah and the juxtaposed Hafiorahs from the Prophets. Although</page><page sequence="2">2 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 the goal of weekly readings is to make the Torah a book of the eternal present- linked to the calendar- this truncated reading habit only demonstrated the authoritative unity of the Tanakh but not its artistic unity. The rabbinic dictum that there is no early and no later in Torah permits the juxtaposition of different passages from very disparate texts. Thus the Haftorah for Genesis 1-6 is Isaiah 42.5-43.10 based on the opening words of Isaiah 42.5 that speak of God as the creator of heaven and earth. The keyword "creation" and the thematics of sin and regenera- cy in both Genesis and Isaiah justified, for the rabbis, the juxtaposition of these texts, but other paired Haftorahs and weekly readings often have no explicit reference to each other. Such an associative rabbinic reading habit is similar to the more atomistic verse-slinging that Christians are subjected to in church. Now, years later, I still lament the fact that many Jews do not have a thorough, unified knowledge of biblical books in their entirety, but only a fragmented exposure- if they go to synagogue- extended over a calendar year. Furthermore, I suspect that many secular Jews are anachro- nistically embarrassed by the Bible, a library of books originating in the early Bronze Age, with its prohibitions against homosexuality, animal- sacrifice cults, cruel holy wars implemented to exterminate the Canaanites, rhetorical abuse directed against individuals and communities (see the "woe oracles" in the Prophets), and Draconian punishments such as those inflicted upon Achan and his family for trespass against the ban at Jericho. Coming to the Hebrew Bible from within the Jewish tradition was neither aesthetically nor intellectually satisfying. My second experience with reading and interpreting biblical texts is as an Americanist, teaching survey courses in American Literature and writing on biblically obsessive authors such as Melville, Thoreau, and Annie Dillard. As a Jewish teacher instructing mostly non-Jewish students, I revel in presenting the essential role of the Bible for personal faith and for social order in the Bible Commonwealth of the Puritans. My students are also astonished that Benjamin Franklin proposed in 1776 that the Continental Congress make the national seal an image of Moses leading Israel through the Reed Sea. Others, in 1776, wanted America to break from England completely and to adopt Hebrew as the national language. Succinctly put, without the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, the idea of America would never have been invented. It is also unsettling to teach the authors of the American Renaissance and to show my students how Whitman, Melville, Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau, and Dickinson not only constantly quoted but also reinterpreted the Hebrew Bible, perpetuating biblical tradition as much as breaching it. For example, Captain Ahab's desire to see the face of Whale-God suggests that he wants to be God and thus explains his</page><page sequence="3">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 3 botched attempt to kill God- a radical reinterpretation of Moses' intimate desire for God's accompanying presence in Exodus 33 and 34. Certainly, an exposure to the Hebrew Bible through the American Renaissance tradition of responsible dissent against organized religion and biblical authority is intellectually deeper than an exposure through the born-again failure of imagination exhibited in popular nineteenth-century religious novels such as Charles Seldon's In His Steps. But, nevertheless, an intertextual reading of the Hebrew Bible and nineteenth-century American texts produces a reinterpreted, appropriated Hebrew Bible. In other words, to read the Hebrew Bible filtered through the prevailing American Christian culture is to read the Jewish Tanakh as Christian literature, a belated First Testament often wrenched violently out of its original context and superseded by the Second Testament. Mine was the futile old cry: give the Jews back their book. Thus coming to the Hebrew Bible from within the American literary tradition was neither artistically nor culturally satisfying. My third experience, however, was my flush of excitement upon reading two critical works that I knew would change the shape of biblical studies: Robert Alter's The Art of Biblical Narrative (1981) and Meir Sternberg's The Poetics of Biblical Narrative (1985). Alter and Sternberg unfettered, exhilarated, and, in effect, transformed biblical studies by giving us a pragmatic repertory of biblical poetics- compositional techniques- that enabled us to rediscover the unity, coherence, and narrative complexi- ty of Hebrew biblical texts. The Alter-Sternberg repertory combines the close-reading of formalist approaches, the stylistic attention of rhetorical studies, the sensitivity to point of view of narratological studies, the gap- filling of reader-response theories, and the focus on patterns of repetition characteristic of structuralist commentaries. Alter and Sternberg focus not only on the key elements of all narratives- character, plot, narrative perspective, and setting- but also elucidate various poetic devices from the semantic range of key words and type scenes to repetition with variation, juxtaposition of narrative scenes, and gaps such as Jacob's silence when confronted with news of the rape of Dinah. The poetic strategy of narrative analogies or parallels is best demonstrated in James Nohrnberg's article in this issue, "Allegories of Scripture": an ingenious study of how one biblical story provides commentary on another. In short, no critics writing today have done more than Alter and Sternberg to teach us how to infer from biblical texts the presence of litefary conventions and then to empower us to interpret narrative and poetry. Coming to the Hebrew Bible through the poetics of Alter and Sternberg is, for me, aesthetically, culturally, and intellectually satisfying because such literary readings respect the aesthetic</page><page sequence="4">4 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 unity of the Hebrew Bible, but do not advocate biblical ethics for twentieth-century culture or Christianize the Hebrew Bible via intertextual reinterpretations. The rediscovery of the literary nature of the Hebrew Bible is one of the most exciting intellectual events of our time. The field of literary approaches to the Hebrew Bible exploded rapidly in the 1980s and is continuing in the 90s, but going beyond poetics- the Bible's compositional strategies- to more hermeneutical concerns- studies of a critic's interpretive assumptions. A selective reading list of the most important books demonstrates the sudden renascent interest in the Hebrew Bible: Robert Alter's The World of Biblical Literature (1992) and The Art of Biblical Poetry (1985); Adele Berlin's Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative (1983); Gabriel Josipovici's The Book of God (1988); David Damrosch's The Narrative Covenant (1987); Leslie Brisman's The Voice of Jacob (1990); Harold Fisch's Poetry with a Purpose (1988). There are seven diverse and often divergent collections of essays: The Bible , edited by Harold Bloom (1987); The Literary Guide to the Bible , edited by Robert Alter and Frank Kermode (1987); The Bible and the Narrative Tradition , edited by Frank McConnell (1986); Literary Interpretations of Biblical Narratives , vol. II, edited by Kenneth R. R. Gros Louis and James Ackerman (1982); Mappings of the Biblical Terrain , edited by Vincent L. Tollers and John Maier (1990); The Book and the Text , edited by Regina Schwartz (1990); and "Not in heaven " Coherence and Complexity in Biblical Narrative , edited by Jason P. Rosenblatt and Joseph C. Sitterson. To track the field efficiently, one also needs to keep an eye on the journals Proof texts, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament , Semeia , and particularly on the series Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature published by Indiana University Press and edited by Herbert Marks and Robert Polzin. Two constantly quoted, older classics are Erich Auerbach's first chapter in Mimesis entitled "Odysseus' Scar" (1946) and Herbert Schneidau's Sacred Discontent: The Bible and Western Tradition (1976). From these books, one can rediscover the new territory of literary approaches to the Hebrew Bible. An overview of the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of most literary approaches to the Hebrew Bible and how they differ from traditional historical-critical scholarship can serve as a gateway into the articles in this issue and as an introduction to the larger Bible-as-literature movement.</page><page sequence="5">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 5 Belief Although Luther wrote that "no one can understand even one iota of the Scriptures unless he has the Spirit of God," modern literary critics bracket personal faith and try to keep it separate from textual understand- ing. Ideological and theological themes are certainly discussed, as is the characterization of God, but not in terms of special pleading for any dogma, creed, or religion. Literary critics, if they are wise, never disclose to the reader their personal beliefs. They also rarely presume to advocate the moral value of the Bible's ethical rules. Literary critics also refuse to accept texts that validate themselves as divine. Instead, the Tanakh , like the Christian Bible and the Koran, was written by human beings for human beings. Literary studies never make claims for divine inspiration or suggest that the ink on the biblical page comes from heaven. The Bible-is-made-in- heaven tag is more of a Christian concern than a Jewish one, as evident in the bitter, rancorous debate over biblical truth that has ripped apart the Baptist denomination. For example, even though the prophets claim to speak divine messages through their own mouths, their books do not claim divine origin or status. Literary studies originate in the university, not the church, and the burden of proof and the intellectual cost of accepting texts as divine is too high if our mission in secular universities is to teach critical thinking. It is essential to note, however, that approaching the Bible as literature does not dispense with the notion of the divine. A literary approach removes the Bible from ecclesiastical control and seeks to interpret God not in dogmatic terms but in terms of the relationship between the human and the divine. In other words, the idea and images of God are dependent upon human thought and action. The following articles in this issue are filled with God-talk, but in terms of language and literary characterization. For example, G. Tom Milazzo's literary and theological article "To an Impotent God" reimagines Yahweh not as omnipotent, but as impotent via a close-reading of Hebrew language, and Bernard Horn's article "Prologue at Sinai" treats Yahweh as a character in a story. History Versus Story Robert Alter sustained enormous criticism when he called the Hebrew Bible "fictionalized history," read scripture as fiction (as story), and focused on the narrative features of biblical texts. Literary critics often prefer the word "texts" rather than the bibliolatry associated with the word "scripture." Alter explains in The Art of Biblical Narrative that the word</page><page sequence="6">6 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 "fiction" does not imply falsehood but conscious literary artistry. Although there is some historical truth in the Bible, the lexical and syntactic choices, the shifts in narrative point of view, the invented dialog, the portrayal of character, and the hyperbolic metaphors are all part of imaginative reenactments of historical events to stress ideological meanings. When meeting a biblical character such as David or Abraham, for example, how much is real and how much is the rhetoric of the artist? We will never know. Literary critics recognize the Tanakh as a mixture of history, genealogy, theology, law, prophecies, and literature that reflects the historian's accuracy, the artist's embellishment, and the theologian's tenets. But narrative critics bracket history as they do personal faith, and prefer to focus on the unity and coherence of the story regardless of whether there is any independent extra-biblical verification for the historicity of the story. For example, the very strong language of the prophets used against individuals to accuse them of everything from adultery to cannibalism may be the rhetorical overkill of irony, slander, and hyperbole and not necessarily historical. In fact, there may be no referent outside the text. For some, the word "God," like "dragons" or "unicorns," has no referent. Only the modern mind insists upon separating the disciplines and genres of history, theology, rhetoric, and philosophy that are inseparable. The Israelite mind was synthetic as our emotions always are. They did not classify and differentiate as we do today. Even in classical Hebrew, there was no single word for "literature." Literature was appropriately called chaim shebichtav- life in writing. Modern Hebrew used the root sefer (book) to form the modern word for literature- sifroot. Thus the Hebrew bible could be called "life in writing"- all of life and all of the genres that language can be expressed in. Literary critics also make strong claims for the primacy of language. The artistic medium chosen by the biblical authors was obviously narrative and poetry; thus, language determines the history and the theology. Theology Versus Story Theologians and historians must read the biblical words before they do theology or history. The normative sources of theology, scripture and sacred tradition, are grounded in interpretive experience- hermeneutics. The Hebrew Bible does make truth-claims about God, creation, and humanity, but these are not given in the propositional forms of a systematic theology. These truths cannot be separated from the imagina- tively charged language of literature: metaphor, symbol, irony, allegory, parable, and diction. For example, what does the metaphor of standing</page><page sequence="7">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 7 naked before God mean theologically (Genesis) or the more extended metaphoricalxonstruct of Israel the beloved being pursued by a possessive lover, a groom-God, Yahweh (Isaiah and Jeremiah)? What does it mean to circumcise one's heart to God? Literary studies serve as an excellent reminder to theologians that God is a linguistic construct and that Torah is not min ha shamayim - from the heavens. In the struggle to express the relationship between the human and the divine, biblical authors relied upon the figurative language of flesh and blood - anthropomorphism. To take such figurative language literally is to misunderstand biblical language completely. To take such metaphori- cal language as only a poetic device is also to misunderstand the complex theological relationship represented by biblical poetic language. From a literary perspective, God is never present to us, but always present through language, mediated to us indirectly through the narratives and metaphors of Torah. Historical-Critical Scholarship Versus Literary Scholarship Meir Sternberg differentiates source inquiry from language inquiry. Theologians, historians, traditional biblical scholars, linguists, textual critics - all want to go back to the source and find out the real-life process that shaped the Israelite communities, beliefs, languages, and texts. The humanly understandable desire to find out what really happened or what is the real theological truth of a text is a kind of stubborn essentialism that contemporary literary scholars reject. An entire sub-discipline was devoted to piecing together a so-called unified Hebraic theology from beneath the centuries of literary embellishment and revision: biblical theology. This movement is now dead. The complete failure of the scholarly quest for the historical Jesus has also raised the question of whether or how Jesus' story can be true if it is not history. The motivation of these pursuits is always the same: to get behind the text, a quest for sources and origins of texts, institutions (e.g., the temple), characters, and settings. Language inquiry, however, tries to discover what the biblical authors and redactors are saying and how they said it. In other words, the focus is on the text itself, not on going behind the text. Of course, a literary critic should know Aramaic and Hebrew to read the texts in the original languages, so in a sense literary critics are not focusing solely on this side of the text, but go back and learn ancient languages. Since our forefather was a wandering Aramean, literary critics take wayside paths into Hebrew grammar, history, sociology, anthropology, and even theology, but most focus on the story as story. Ideally, source</page><page sequence="8">8 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 and language criticism, what most scholars call historical and literary studies, should be interdependent, but they are rarely coextensive and reciprocal in the same commentary. The main weakness of literary studies is that they do not take advantage of the knowledge of the history and culture of the ancient world that traditional historical-source scholarship has painstakingly accumulated over the last two hundred years. In their legitimate refusal to reconstruct the history of a biblical text from literary elements in the text, literary critics have bracketed too much of history and often reject historical knowledge as an aid to understanding biblical texts. The Bible-as-literature movement often reminds me of the Karaite movement in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Karaism was characterized by a rejection of rabbinic authority and interpretation (including the Talmud) and by a flourishing of individualistic biblical interpretations and interest in rationalistic criticism of the Hebrew Bible. The new literary commentaries on the Hebrew Bible, like the Karaite commentaries, usually ignore the insights from midrashim and from the Talmud. Although rabbinic commentaries turn the Hebrew Bible into one disjointed associative text by mixing together lines from all over the canon and thus destroying the artistic unity of individual texts, many of their insights are essentially literary. Although the rabbis often resorted to the deus ex machina to fill in textual gaps, such as why Haman fell on Esther's couch (he was pushed by an angel), there are hundreds of invaluable grammatical and literary insights in the dozen extant collections of Midrash that are rarely used except by those scholars who focus primarily on midrashic studies. Synchronic Versus Diachronic Reading Literary critics have become increasingly suspicious of the hermeneutic circle between text and history. Thus they strive for a synchronic reading of texts; they seek to read a biblical story as a whole unity, in its present form, as formalist critics do with nonbiblical literature. They seek to read the text regardless of its compositional sources, multiple authorship, and preliterary history and to give close readings of a continuous text rather than the disjointed pericope-by-pericope old-fashioned biblical commen- tary. Literary critics do not deny multiple authorship or conceive of biblical poetry and narrative as a single unified production from a single unified sensibility- admittedly a dangerous assumption given the history and complex transmission of ancient texts. But they respect the creativity of the redactor or editor and deny the notion that redactors exhibited a slavish deference to their sources. An edited work becomes, in essence, a new</page><page sequence="9">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 9 literary work. Literary critics usually work with the final text, whether the result of one or ten authors, two or nine redactors. Literary critics usually resist assigning difficult passages to another hypothetical historical source and are more likely to respect the transmission of the Masoretic text as preserved by the Jewish tradition. Previous biblical scholars who followed form and source criticism, however, used diachronic approaches. They sought to reconstruct the development of a biblical story through time by determining the underly- ing literary strata (the documentary hypothesis, which assumes Yahwistic, Elohistic, Deuteronomistic, and Priestly strata), preliterary oral forms, and traditional history. The result was often fragmentation of the text's narrative unity. The most famous examples of this kind of scholarship are Wellhausen's nineteenth-century Prolegomena and Gunkel's The Legends of Genesis (1901). What is essential to remember, however, is that we have no original documents for the entire Hebrew Bible; thus, much of traditional biblical textual scholarship is merely educated guesswork without any extant manuscript to support textual reconstructions. Let me explain how a diachronic reading works in older, historical biblical studies. First, a scholar analyzes the biblical text to reconstruct the historical circumstances within which the text arose. For example, since the prophetic text Jeremiah claims that "the word of the Lord came to" Jeremiah "in the days of King Josiah," and we know that Josiah was a reforming king who died at age 39 at the Battle of Megiddo in 609 B.C.E., a scholar could date Jeremiah's birth in 627 B.C.E. Once he has completed this reconstruction, he then uses it to analyze the text. Once recovered, the historical context supposedly offers deeper insight into the origin and the meaning of the text. Once established, the historical stages of development become the basis for determining not only the actual date of but also the historical circumstances behind the text. For example, some scholars claim that the passage "When Your words were offered, I devoured them" in Jeremiah's second complaint refers to the actual finding of the scroll in the Temple under King Josiah in 621 B.C.E. This dating would make Jeremiah a very precocious six-year-old child. But since Jeremiah's prophetic call came to him while he was in his mother's womb, the dating could fit. Such guesswork only shows how modern historical diachronic scholars seem to lose all sense of proportion and reason when it comes to some biblical texts. Moreover, this reasoning is circular. The relationship between a highly edited, revised collection of texts such as Jeremiah and history that such thinking presumes and assumes cannot be established. A wrong assumption is made here: that the events of history within which the fictional texts arose can be recovered from the literary texts themselves.</page><page sequence="10">10 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 Scholars, such as G. Tom Milazzo, who have studied Josephus, Herodotus, and Thucydides, have taught us that in the ancient world recounting history was not distinct from interpreting it. The accounts of history the ancients offered were apologia. Events were retold and reinterpreted with a particular end and perspective in mind. The same can be said about the texts in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, such as the complete whitewash of King David's sins in Chronicles. Biblical texts proceed from a distinctive theological perspective which colors and shapes the interpretation of the historical circumstances these texts offer. Often, historical events are accessible only through allusion, metaphor, symbol, or allegory. For example, in Ezekiel 23, we have an extended allegory about Oholah and her sister Oholibah "whose breasts were squeezed and whose virgin nipples were handled." Both sisters played the whore in the land of Egypt and desired intimacy with the soldiers "whose members were like those of asses and whose organs were like those of stallions." These sensual and allegorical details refer not only to cultic apostasy (idol worship) but perhaps to Israel's and Judah's foolish political alliances with the wrong powers. A literary study of biblical texts recogniz- es the Hebrew Bible not as a historical account of what happened but as an archival testimony to various interpretations of what happened. For literary critics, the Bible is foremost a narrative concerned with various themes, not a historical record. In fact, some narratives go out of their way to challenge the historicity of events, such as the extremely ironic Book of Esther. Perhaps, Nietzsche's hermeneutic suspicion is not that extreme: "there are no facts, only interpretations." In effect, our only access to the events behind the text is through language. Even more important is the insight that discovering the historical context behind these biblical texts imposes an idea of history upon them that is alien to biblical literature. Ancient texts are not less historical than modern historical approaches, but are surely different. The Bible's notion of providential history is very different from the presuppositions of modern historical studies. Furthermore, since historical events are not the primary subjects of biblical texts, it is difficult if not impossible to recover them from the texts alone. Extra-biblical evidence is needed to confirm the historicity of biblical characters and events considering our often complete lack of knowledge independent of the texts themselves. A perfect example is the prophetic book Jeremiah. Since we have no extra-biblical knowledge of a real person named Jeremiah, literary critics would treat him as a character and as a voice in a work of fiction, thus recognizing the impossibility of moving from text to the so-called real historical Jeremiah. Many traditional biblicists, however, such as Hanson, still assume that the</page><page sequence="11">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 11 historical context is for the most part accessible in and through the text. Literary critics would argue that the factual historical context from which these texts emerged is accessible only indirectly, implicitly, through deliberate literary artistry. Unity Versus Disunity: Bible or ta biblia The main criticism of biblical poetics and literary biblical studies is that the Bible is not a unified fully artistic composition but a disparate and divergent set of documents combined together by the accidents and emergencies of history such as scribal error or the destruction of the Temple. Literary critics strive not to blur differences, such as trying to reconcile the philosophical skepticism of Ecclesiastes with the orthodox beliefs in Proverbs, the eroticism of the Song of Songs with the grieving of Lamentations, the different views of Solomon in 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles, or the different versions of the ten commandments in Exodus and Deuteronomy. But literary commentators do not view such divergences as textual corruption, contradictions, inconsistencies, or incompetent editing. Instead, literary critics reveal to us the unity that underlies the diversity of each text and the entire canon of texts- a unity that has been ignored in biblical studies for hundreds of years. Robert Alter in The World of Biblical Literature shows the ideological continuity and artistic unity over time that the biblical habit of allusion gives to disparate texts. Alter demonstrates how within the story of Amnon's rape of Tamar there are several allusions to the earlier story of Joseph and his brothers. Shared images and language between two different stories give an interlocking unity to the Bible's themes and ideologies. Another biblical strategy for unity is an intertextual hermeneutical method of twisting scripture, of subjecting older earlier texts to radical reinterpretations by subtle repetitions, variations, and omissions that Michael Fishbane calls "inner biblical midrash" in his Biblical Interpretations in Ancient Israel (1985). Inferring from an ancient text a biblical poetics and a unified artistry raises the question of authorial intention: can we be sure that the author(s) intended to write parallel lines of poetry and narrative type scenes, or are we viewing the past through the expectations of modern literature like a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court? The Bible does not offer direct, unmediated access to the consciousness of its authors. We know nothing of biblical authors. They did not leave behind introductions, journals, or letters telling us of their intentions or about their literary methods. Rather, the biblical texts testify to a world of deliberate artistry, works that can be viewed holistically because of consistent patterns of</page><page sequence="12">12 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 meanings and stylistic choices that are fully realized in the text and enable us to recognize different poetic and narrative strategies as part of the same overall project, even the changes and embellishments that show the evolution of biblical thought and style over time. Artistic unity is a seductive god for literary critics. Literature Versus Law, Morality, and Prophecies One of the strongest criticisms leveled against literary approaches to the Hebrew Bible is that they are not inclusive enough of the different genres in the Tanakh : the works of priests, prophets, sages, poets, psalmists, rationalists, mystics, believers, and skeptics. The Bible-as- literature movement is still a fair-weather sailor, able to navigate through the novelistic 1 and 2 Samuel or the sexy Proverb poems (e.g., Proverbs 5), but not knowing what to do when the rough winds of Job, Ecclesiastes or the Major Prophets blow. In fact, there are very few literary commentaries on the three separate collections of laws in the Hebrew Bible (the Covenant Code in Exodus, the Holiness Code in Leviticus, and the Laws in Deuteronomy) and on the Prophets. Literary approaches will not have "arrived" as a sub-discipline until we have literary readings of Job, Isaiah, and Jeremiah that do not dissect the text atomistically as the completely unreadable Hermeneia series does. Perhaps the lack of literary work on the Prophets (Heschel and von Rad are earlier exceptions) can be explained by the highly theological nature of prophetic prose and poetry and the difficult stylistic features- the wild swings in mood, genre, discourse- and the extreme difficulty of the Hebrew. Prophetic texts seem to point to the very limits of poetry, or art, to give an adequate idea and image of God: "To whom, then, can you liken Me, /To whom can I be compared?- says the Holy One" (Isaiah 40.25). A further criticism of literary readings is that they contain little mention of the ethical aspects that constitute much of the Hebrew Bible's meaning. The charge is that the search for textual complexity within aesthetic unity has blinded literary critics to the moral rigor of biblical teachings: "Cease to do evil; Learn to do good. Search for justice" (Isaiah 1.16-17). There is also a perceived danger of religious reductionism and spiritual illiteracy in focusing solely on compositional techniques. Michael Fishbane, for example, in Proof texts (Jan. 1981), expressed that he "would not like to see the eventual sophistication of the literary study of the Bible obscure the religious truths which the Bible itself seeks to teach." For Fishbane and others, the Bible is foremost a theological narrative of God and Israel that engenders a religious-historical universe. I suspect that</page><page sequence="13">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 13 these critics want to know if by better understanding the literary qualities of scripture we can rediscover what it is like to believe or to behave biblically. For many anti-literary critics, the law holds literature on a leash. But the leash is short and the contrast between literature and law may be spurious, for biblical narratives may engender the same meanings as non- narrative biblical laws. The Role of the Reader In the process of reading and interpreting the Tanakh , readers are affected by the often tortuous experience of reading difficult texts. The Bible produces skepticism (Job and Ecclesiastes), instinctive passion (Song of Songs), hope (some of the Psalms), wonder (Jonah), and even faith or doubt. Depending upon one's temperament, training, tradition, and literary competence, each reader tends to interpret differently. Further- more, no author can control what readers will find in a text. The reader's imagination often supplies meaning in a text that authors never intended but that may still elucidate the central emphases of the text. Wolfgang Iser's famous star metaphor explains how different readers interpret texts differently: if two people gaze at the night sky, one will see in the stars an image of a plough, and the other will see a dipper. The stars of the biblical text are fixed, but a reader's lines will join them differently. Literary critics exploit this insight in their diverse and often divergent interpretations. The above comments hold true for the reading of any great literature, but they are especially important for biblical studies because the role of the reader reminds us that meaning will be found in the experience of reading the text, between the text and the reader, not between the text and the events that supposedly happened before, behind, or above the text. The deeper implications of the reader's role for theology is that belief in the Bible can now mean an openness to the ways in which the Hebrew Bible calls readers to interact with the text. In fact, I think that the best literary and theological reflection is marked by an exegesis of human existence: how we live, love, suffer, and die. Certainly, a text-centered existentialist reading of Job can make our lives more bearable if not comprehensible by helping us accept human limitations and difficulties. But this emphasis on application of biblical texts to our lives is rarely made by literary critics and still remains within the discipline and spiritual purpose of theology. Despite the different affective aims of literary and theological studies, however, they both borrow from each other resources and techniques and, in some cases, can thoroughly interpenetrate each other.</page><page sequence="14">14 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 Picasso and William Carlos Williams Finally, perhaps the best way to understand literary approaches to the Hebrew Bible is to remember Picasso's statement: "art is a lie that tells the truth. " In his manuscript on the Synoptic Gospels, The Burial of Mark: Gospels as Fictions , Herbert Schneidau reminds us that biblical texts are disguised fictions that posture as historical chronicles, as unmediated descriptions of real historical events. But all texts are artfully mediated by language, by a narrator telling a story, no matter how many historically implausible claims texts may make about theophanies from mountains or about men as miracle workers. There are no unmediated divine or human words that bypass the circumstances and consciousness of human writers and their cultures. Authors also forget, lie, exaggerate, and select. Redactors, who are just as creative, sort-out, reject, rewrite, or project their own uncertainties into the text. But, nevertheless, the Hebrew Bible, for Jews, Christians, and all students of literature, is our inescapable heritage, the truth of truths for some and the story of stories for others. The truths Picasso saw in art are always debatable, but without them, as William Carlos Williams wrote, "men die miserably every day. ..." Editorial Protocols Rather than give a brief synopsis of each article in this issue as most editors do in an introduction, I prefer to foreground my own protocols and explain my editorial decisions. I rejected those authors whose critical discourse is given in place of the primary biblical text. I am partial to text- centered exegesis that does not let alien, hypothetical taxonomies or elaborate neologisms take the place of turning to the biblical text. I prefer interpretations generated by the difficulties of the biblical text, not by a prior ideology or literary hermeneutic. There is a problem of focus and priority if an article on Esther, for example, discusses, Lacan, Foucault, and Hegel, but rarely turns to the book of Esther. The translation of a story into the Gestalt of a twentieth-century interpretive paradigm can situate the critic intellectually in our time but should also explain or interpret some problem in the primary text. Herbert Schneidau's essay "The Interilluminating Bible" is the only exception to my rule, but it was irresistible to me, for it tempers my Jewish concern over the Christian co- optation of the Hebrew Bible, gives a good overview of literary theory, and challenges Jews to read poststructuralist literary criticism of the Christian Bible. In keeping with the editorial tradition of Shofar, I chose essays that</page><page sequence="15">Rediscovering the Hebrew Bible as Literature 15 are eminently accessible to the educated layperson rather than written only for academic cryptographers of a sub-sub-discipline. Some readers will notice inconsistencies in the articles that follow because of the authors' use of God's names, capitalizations, choice of translations, and names for the Hebrew Bible. Thus some call the Hebrew Bible the " Tanakh "; others, the "Old Testament." Some call the God of the Hebrew Bible "Lord," "Yahweh," "YHWH," "El," or "it." Most of the authors quote scholarly equivalent translations or offer their own translations from the Hebrew Masoretic text. Some authors capitalize "God" and the "Bible" (or "Biblical"), and some do not. Just as an experienced teacher knows that the best way to educate really bright students is to stay out of their way, I chose, as editor, not to interfere with how the authors wrestle with God, text, and canon. The one non-negotiable criterion for selecting these essays was that they be interesting to read. All of the essays in this issue are interesting in their separate ways. Some are irritating, quirky, and puzzling. Others are ingenious, passionate, and humorous. These essays are not all easily readable nor equally likable, but they all enrich and deepen our under- standing of the Hebrew Bible. Trinity University San Antonio, Texas</page></plain_text>
