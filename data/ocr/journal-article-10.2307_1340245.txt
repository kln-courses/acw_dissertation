<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CRIMES OF POLITICS. By Francis A. Allen.1 Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. 1974. Pp. ix, 105. $6.95. Reviewed by Sanford H. Kadish 2 Unlike discoveries in the world of nature which are made only once, those in the world of social affairs can be made over and over again. There, rediscovering the wheel is not just an old joke. As in the world of fashion the thoroughly old hat may be worn as the latest production, or worse, as if the very idea of the hat has been grasped for the first time. This is all very well with things like dress where a little make-believe lends a needed zest to life. It can be a far more serious matter when the stakes are understanding and action with respect to important social prob- lems. These observations are well-illustrated by the current move- ment in academic criminology 3 to which Professor Allen devotes the first of the three Holmes Lectures that make up The Crimes of Politics. The dominant feature of this movement is its fascination with the theme that the criminal justice system serves primarily and essentially as a means of maintaining political domination by those in power. Now, of course, there is a political dimension to criminal law, as indeed there is to all law. Its prohibitions largely reflect the values of the lawmakers. These values may or may not be widely shared, depending on the extent of democratic partici- 1 Professor of Law, University of Michigan. 2 Professor of Law, University of California, Berkeley. 3 See, e.g., R.

Even when lawmaking is majoritarian, the laws may be felt as onerous, even repressive, by a dissident minority with differing values. The criminal law may also be abusively administered against minorities. Surely these are commonplace propositions. Lawyers and law scholars have historically been concerned with demarking the reasonable and proper boundaries of the substantive criminal law, with formulating restrictive principles, constitutional and otherwise, to protect essential freedoms against criminal prohibition and to protect the citizen against excesses in the administration of criminal justice. Yet those in the vanguard of the new criminology often behave as if no one had taken notice of these aspects of criminal justice before their recent enlightenment. One might welcome the awakening of criminology to this political dimension of crime. For generations criminologists were occupied, perhaps excessively, with theories of crime causation or modes of correction and rehabilitation. The principal burden of Professor Allen's first lecture, however, is to demonstrate why the welcome must be seriously qualified. The source of the difficulty is essentially two-fold. First, like most recent converts, the new criminologists suffer from lack of perspective and proportion. In the zeal of discovery (or perhaps in the guilt of its lateness) they tend to regard the political di- mension of crime as all that is worth considering, and to be blinded to the multidimensional aspects of what is, after all, a complex phenomenon. So, for example, as Professor Allen observes, the reality of widespread crimes of violence and the profoundly ex- perienced fear of crime are hardly noticed as serious problems for criminological research (p. 14). Likewise unperceived are any features of the subject which fail to confirm the theory of crim- inal law as purely an instrument through which the dominant class maintains dominance over the powerless - for example, the fact observed by Professor Allen that "the choice to exercise political power through the established agencies of criminal justice has often meant a moderation of oppression, not its exacerbation" (p. I9). An English sociologist has well expressed the intellectual thinness of this new strain of criminology. Suggesting that it embodies no more than "anthropomorphic conspiracy theory," he continues:4 There is little conception of history. If the social contract was not imposed today, it was certainly imposed in the recent past. ... The perspective offers no understanding of law as 4 Rock, The Sociology of Deviancy and Conceptions of Moral Order, 14 BRIT. J. CRIM. 139, I44 (1974).</page><page sequence="3">842 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 88 a complex and variegated rule-system whose origins are fre- quently as mysterious to elites as to the governed. It offers no vision of a legal system as a series of constraints upon law- giver and ruled alike. It does not refer to legitimacy and authority other than in the context of manipulation and mystification. The second source of the difficulty is that the new criminolo- gists' discovery of politics in crime tends to be part and parcel of an ideological convulsion to the left rather than a step toward understanding. The institutions of the law generally, and those of the criminal law in particular, are seen purely as instruments for perpetuating the rule of a repressive and iniquitous state. Crime itself, therefore, is almost romanticized as a kind of legiti- mate challenge to the repressive state, or at least as its direct product. The state itself is the "criminal" against which action is required: its social wrongs are the "crimes" it commits. Crim- inology is thus transferred into anticriminology and scientific inquiry into a movement for radical political change. So it is, for example, that in one School of Criminology with which I am familiar the foundation course in criminology was featured as centering on the "crimes of imperialism, racism, and sexism" in American society. I join Professor Allen in doubting that an academic criminology with so much passion and so little discern- ment is likely to make much of its new enlightenment by way of scholarly contribution, however much its practitioners may con- tribute to political action and rhetoric.5 As Professor Allen well puts it, "modern criminology is in danger of being enslaved by its own emancipation" (p. I3). Professor Allen directs his second lecture to "political crime," a concept much invoked in recent years in behalf of such diverse persons as draft resisters, participants in disorderly demonstra- tions, those who blow up buildings, and terrorist groups engaged in killing and kidnapping. The common thread appears to be a presumed political motivation of the defendants in committing the crimes or of the state in prosecuting them. By extension the further notion of "political prisoners" has emerged to cover all incarcerated prisoners, whatever the nature or context of their crimes, and particularly members of minority groups which have been historic victims of discrimination and exclusion. In all in- stances the concepts are invoked to justify the conduct of the defendants or prisoners, or at least to attract sympathy for and divert condemnation of their behavior. 5 For a well argued contrary view, see Sykes, The Rise of Critical Criminology, 65 J.

L. &amp; C. 206 (i974).</page><page sequence="4">I975] BOOK REVIEWS 843 Professor Allen is not insensitive to the "bizarre and incom- prehensible" (p. 36) nature of this rhetoric or to its frequent use as a propagandistic "sanguinary simile" designed "to terminate analysis and reflection and to recruit emotion" (p. 40). With char- acteristic perspective, however, he cautions that we should seek to learn what we can about our society from the emergence of these usages. The idea of a political crime, after all, is well-known to continental legal systems, in which it serves to mitigate penal- ties out of a libertarian deference to what is seen as the ethical motivation of the actors. It is also known in international law where it may serve as a bar to extradition. He suggests, sensibly, I think, that the central reason why political crime has not emerged as a legal concept in our system is that "most Americans have not conceived of the law and the institutions of justice as creations alien to them and their vital interests. On the contrary, their hostility is likely to be directed toward those who challenge the authority of the law, and who appear thereby to jeopardize the elaborate system of privileges and restraints on which the law and the political institutions of a pluralistic society are based" (pp. 33-34). But this consensus, he reminds us, is beginning to break down under the variety of pressures of contemporary Amer- ican life and, rather than dismissing the new vocabulary as con- trary to common sense, Professor Allen urges that we attend to the underlying pathologies in our system that produce it (pp. 37-38). But surely we may do both. Recently a woman was tried and convicted in California for searching out and killing her alleged rapist after the event. Certain women's groups rallied to her de- fense on the ground that hers was a political crime. Presumably she is now a political prisoner. It seems to me one is fully entitled -I would even say obliged -to scorn the bizarre inanity of such assertions notwithstanding that buried beneath them lie serious grievances directed at the law of rape and its enforcement. Hysteria is no less an enemy of reasoned action than myopia. Professor Allen's concluding lecture is a further contribution to the developing literature on the limits of the criminal sanction, to borrow the title of Herbert Packer's important book.6 It takes the form of a vade mecum of the perils of criminal prosecutions designed to protect the security and stability of the political order. (While Professor Allen refers to these crimes as political crimes, properly so-called, the term has been so debased by indiscriminate usage that - like a number of once useful obscenities in our lan- guage - it has lost its power to communicate.) His argument is 6 H. PACKER, THE LIMITS OF THE CRIMINAL SANCTION (1968).</page><page sequence="5">844 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 88 not that such prosecutions are necessarily illegitimate, prone to excess though they historically have been, but that the medicine risks unintended side-effects which may be far worse than the disease. For example, he analyzes and illustrates with great per- suasiveness how such trials tend to be based on miscalculations of the extent and nature of the social change that is reflected in the conduct (p. 56); how they often end up further weakening the consensus they are designed to shore up (p. 58); how they may produce situations where the defense turns the tables and puts the state's system of justice on trial (pp. 60-6I); how they risk exposing courts to damage to their reputation for justice (pp. 61- 62); how they magnify all the latent and endemic vices in the administration of justice, such as arbitrary prosecutorial discre- tion and police excesses (pp. 62-69); and how, in a variety of ways, they contribute to the further weakening of the criminal justice system generally. These three lectures are vintage Allen - the most uncommon common sense conveyed in tones which mock the stridency and vacuity of so much of the public -and even the academic- debate. That I despair he will go unheeded reflects not on his counsel but on our times.</page></plain_text>
