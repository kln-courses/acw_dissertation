Height , about 50 centimeters . Ganymede and the Eagle: A Marble Group from Carthage by Elaine K. Gazda Most people today think of Carthage as the Punic city that was leveled by the Romans in 146 b.c. What is less well- known is that the čity was rebuilt around a hundred years later by Julius Caesar and prospered as a great capital for another 700 years. Recently, Car- thage has been the focus of an interna- tional campaign to save its archaeologi- cal treasures from eventual destruction by modern urban sprawl. Launched in 1971-72 by the Tunisian Institute of Ar- chaeology and Art in conjunction with Unesco, this campaign has involved more than a dozen countries in an effort to explore various aspects of ancient Carthage and her harbor. The United States was represented by two teams of archaeologists, one from the University of Michigan, who over a period of five years explored a large field not far from the ancient harbor, where a second American team from the Universities of Chicago and Harvard have been since 1975. The Michigan field, flanked by a large avenue to the east and a railway to the west, was first excavated by Tunisian archaeologists in 1970-71. Thanks largely to these efforts, the land was spared from development and large parts of a fifth-century after Christ church and a later Byzantine church were exposed. The Michigan team be- gan their work adjacent to the earlier Tunisian trenches concentrating on two different building complexes. The first of these lay immediately alongside the previously excavated Byzantine church and the second in the next insula or city block to the west of the church.

Underneath both of these complexes lay a series of Punic and early Roman buildings. The Michigan team, however, decided to focus on the later levels which embrace the Vandal and Byzantine periods (a.D. 400-700), about which very little was known. Much of the 1977 season was devoted to a study of the cisterns and their con- tents which were found throughout both building complexes. Unlike most of the walls of the superstructure, these cis- terns were extremely well preserved, and in some cases had been used in antiq- uity as convenient receptacles for gar- bage after their function as water cis- terns ceased in about the fifth century. Cisterns seem to have been the primary means of collecting water for Cartha- ginians from about the third century b.c. to the Arabic period in a.D. 693; individual cisterns were generally used over many centuries with the help of minor repairs and regular cleaning. The cisterns of Carthage One such cistern was built as a pair of chambers lying below the main formal dining room or triclinium of the House of the Greek Charioteers. These two chambers in fact were built in Punic times and were reused throughout Ro- man times until as late as the fifth century after Christ. At that date or a little later the southern chamber be- came a handy place in which to dump unwanted domestic refuse. This rubbish was largely comprised of animal and fish bones, decomposed organic matter and fragments of household pottery - evidently kitchen refuse. During exca- vation the contents of the cistern were sifted to ensure almost total recovery since such remains are important for a fuller understanding of the economic and social conditions of the period. Ex- pedition member David Reese of Cam- bridge University studied the more than 20,000 recovered bone fragments including over 1,600 chicken and 1,400 fish remains. The 2,500 pottery sherds were examined by John Riley of the University of Southampton, and Ellen Hoffman of the University of Michigan studied the seeds and carbonized wood. The 120 coins were scrutinized by Wil- liam Metcalf of the American Numis- matic Society and others have studied the architecture and stratigraphy of the cisterns. These studies have revealed that most of the refuse originally ac- cumulated outside the cistern and was then thrown down into it during a gen- eral clean-up of the area, probably not long after the Byzantines won Carthage back from the Vandals in a.d. 533. Mixed in with all this household ref- use were 17 fragments of a small marble group of Ganymede and the Eagle - which depicts the protagonists of the well-known myth of Zeus abducting the young Trojan boy. This serendipitous find, since repaired, stands about 50 centimeters high. Made from a single block of pure white marble, cut so thinly that in places the stone is almost trans- parent, it is a tour de force of ancient sculpture. Despite its small size, the group is remarkably expressive. Gany- mede strikes a languorous pose, his left leg crossed over the right, his left arm akimbo and his right arm loosely draped around the neck of Zeus, who is shown in the guise of an eagle. Zeus perches tensely on the tree with his wings outspread and gazes amorously at the object of his desire. Ganymede, for his part, looks responsively, almost di- rectly into his pursuer's piercing eyes. This frankly erotic encounter is ob- served from below by a lethargic goat and a leaping dog, the latter howling in protest at the imminent departure of his young master for Olympus where he will replace Hebe as cupbearer to the gods. Apart from numerous breaks, some stains and missing parts, the sculpture is in an astonishingly good state of pre- servation. The main losses are the small branches of the tree, at least three of which once extended upward above the eagle's head. The surface of the sculp- ture exhibits virtually no signs of weathering. The entire figure of Gany- mede, the bodies of the dog and the goat, the lower tree trunk and the base retain a high polish, while the eagle's body pre- serves a sfumato or blurry finish. The dark orange discoloration of the tree trunk and the gray color of Ganymede's face were caused by the oxidation of iron dowels that had been inserted to repair July/ August 1981 57</page><page sequence="3">Both the Carthage Ganymede and this fifth- century statue o f the "Y ounger Magistrate" from Aphrodisias in Asia Minor exhibit similar handling of their cloaks, helping archaeologists place the Carthage Gany- mede in a general period. the statuette in antiquity. These dowels were inserted into the tree trunk and Ganymede's neck and right ankle with a bituminous lime mortar, but other breaks which occurred at the same time were not repaired for reasons which are not certain. Perhaps shortly thereafter the sculpture was discarded. Search for parallels Other technical evidence suggests that the sculpture was never displayed in antiquity, but rather that it broke while it was being prepared for its in- tended setting. Some details on the front were left incomplete; moreover it rests on an unstable base whose lower surface slopes steeply, causing the sculpture to lean forward at a precarious angle. There are signs that the base was in the process of being reworked to fit it for a niche, but in order to mount the sculp- ture securely, it would have been neces- sary to place it on a surface that sloped in the opposite direction and to fix it in placed with clamps or cement of which there are no traces. The most critical problem posed by the sculpture is its date. Evidence is pro- vided by the archaeological context and the style of the sculpture. There can be little doubt that the fragments of Gany- mede were thrown into the cistern at the same time as the kitchen debris. The bulk of this debris dates to about the middle of the fifth century, perhaps ex- tending through the third quarter of the century, and fragments of the sculpture were distributed throughout the de- posit. The debris was subsequently thrown down the wellhead some time after the Byzantine reconquest of Car- thage. Its archaeological context sug- gests that the sculpture belonged to the owners of the House of the Greek Char- ioteers, for it is difficult to imagine that the marble fragments would have been transported from elsewhere in the city to be discarded with kitchen refuse or that the rubbish heap itself would have been hauled from another location. In- deed, the sculpture would fit in well with the environment of this sumptuous dwelling which had undergone com- plete renovation during the early part of the fifth century. Walls were rebuilt on a new plan, mosaic floors were laid and undoubtedly sculptures were installed. If the Ganymede group did belong to this house and if the superb condition of the marble surface indicates that the sculpture was new at the time, it might be concluded that the group had been made in the early fifth century. Archaeological evidence, however, cannot prove this date, since other ex- planations are possible to account for the fine condition of the sculpture and why it ended up in this particular cis- tern. Additional information, therefore, must be deduced from its style and tech- nique. The sculptor avoided dramatic coloristic contrasts in favor of broad, silken surfaces subtly accented by the scalloped feathers, the crisp curls of Ganymede's hair, and the rippling folds at the end of his cloak. It is clear from the treatment of the eyes that the group cannot have been carved prior to the Hadrianic period (a.d. 117-138) when the habit of dotting the pupil with a drill first came into fashion, while the con- trast between the textured drilling of the hair and the glassy polish on most of the surface would not predate the An- tonine period (a.d. 137-61). A search for stylistic parallels thus begins in the late second and continues to the mid-fifth century when the sculpture was most likely discarded. While similar bucolic compositions, pictorial effects and con- trasts of polished surfaces and drilled details may be found in varying degrees of artistic refinement at numerous chronological intervals within this broad span of time, it is the facial type of Ganymede himself which provides the most telling clues to the actual date of the piece. Some features of the boy's face, like the broad facial planes and straight nose have precedents in classi- cal art, while others, such as the heavy eyelids and small mouth were particu- larly favored in Roman art from the An- tonine period onward. But it was not until the reign of Theodosius that they were integrated and refined in the man- ner in which they appear here. Among the best comparisons are the heads of young officers who appear in the back- grounds of reliefs on the base of the obe- lisk of Theodosius I (reigned a.d. 346- 95), probably carved shortly after the monument was raised in the hippo- drome of Constantinople in a.d. 390. Al- though the coiffures differ, the similar- ity of the basic facial type is unmistak- able. Clearly, the sculptor of the Car- thage group was familiar with the styles and methods of sculptors who had worked for the Theodosian court in Con- stantinople. Ganymede's facial type is closely paralleled in works of art of the late fourth century, but the highly ab- stract handling of the cluster of folds on the shoulder indicates that the sculp- ture must date no earlier than the fifth century. The design of the blade-like looped curves that fall over the left hip and leg of the so-called younger Magis- trate from Aphrodisias, a work of the first quarter of the fifth century, may be compared. The schematization of Gany- mede's facial features and drapery is wholly consistent with the geometric conception of the composition whose linear abstraction, softened by smooth- ly finished surfaces and repeated curves is characteristic of much of Theodosian art. Christian counterparts This unprecedented find from Car- thage has introduced a type of marble sculpture not previously represented among the known work of Theodosian art - that is, small decorative groups which portray a mythological subject in a refined, classicizing style. Although both the style and the pagan theme of the Carthage group have many close rel- atives among the ornamental objects and mosaics made for the elite during this time, the question remains: are there other works of this date which be- long to the same class of small pagan marble groups? In fact, the Carthage Ganymede has Christian counterparts among the marble vignettes which or- nament the façades and elaborate sar- cophagi from the fourth and fifth cen- turies, among them the famous sarcoph- agus of Junius Bassus dating to a.d. 359. But there are also other pagan groups that must date to this period. A number of small marble sculptures of Olympian deities, including a "Diana at the Hunt" and a "Venus with Erotes and a Triton" were found in 1843 among the 58 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">This statue of "Diana of the Hunt" was found in the ruins of a fourth-century Roman villa. The simple geometric composition and polished surface closely parallel the Carthage Ganymede. A shepherd with his dog and ram is depicted on a silver bowl which once belonged to a prominent Christian family in Carthage. It derives from the pastoral tradition of pagan art which may have reminded its owners of Christ, the Good Shepherd. ruins of a late Roman villa in Aquitaine, France. They too exhibit simple geomet- ric compositions and polished surfaces, and have facial details, figure propor- tions and molded bases like those of the Ganymede group. The examples found in France are somewhat larger and less refined in their technical handling than the Ganymede, but the similarities among the three pieces are so striking that it is likely that they were all made in the same atelier, possibly located in Asia Minor. This is suggested in part by the fact that the figures conform to the aesthetic standard of the Constantino- politan court and partly because the ab- stract treatment of Ganymede's cloak is closely comparable to that of numerous statue^ from sites such as Ephesus and Aphrodisias in Asia Minor. Secular or spiritual? Both of these cities had been major centers for marble sculpture throughout the Roman era, and their ateliers con- tinued to flourish well into the fifth cen- tury after Christ. A neutron activation analysis of the Ganymede marble de- tected trace elements common to mar- bles from Ephesus, while marbles from Aphrodisias were less closely related. The evidence in support of both the Theodosian date and such an eastern provenance is strengthened by a vivid account by Theodoret, Bishop of Cyr- rhus in Syria from a.d. 423 to about 466, in which he relates that works of art portraying pagan subjects were being made and admired in his day, including sculptures which "portray Zeus raging toward Ganymede in the form of an eagle." The domestic contexts in which the examples from Carthage and Gaul were found would seem to imply that these sculptures functioned as ornaments rather than as the idols which Bishop Theodoret abhorred. In Carthage in the early fifth century there were Christian as well as pagan members of the classi- cally educated elite, and among both groups were those who appreciated the style and content of classicizing art. Judging from evidence gleaned from elsewhere in the Byzantine Empire, some Christians avidly admired works of art of this kind purely for their pagan content. In the mid-fifth century Bishop Quodvultdeus of Carthage preached, apparently without success, to members of his flock who continued to attend pa- gan festivals, circus races and theatri- cal spectacles depiçting the amorous ad- ventures of the pagan gods. What then is the meaning of the Ganymede from Carthage? According to one major tradition of the myth, Ganymede became a symbol of the im- mortality of the soul. Another tradition emphasized the erotic aspect of the myth, with the love of Zeus for Gany- mede serving as the prototype for male July/August 1981 59</page><page sequence="5">A head of a youth , one of many that appear in the back- ground reliefs that ornament the base of the obelisk of Theodosius I in the hippodrome of Constantinople, is similar in style to the treatment of Ganymede s face. Dating to the fourth century, this sculpture shows a Satyr and Maenad dancing as Eros looks on. Although larger than the Carthage Ganymede , its similar style may indicate that they were made in the same workshop. homosexual liaisons. As early as the fourth century b.c. the eagle had re- placed the anthropomorphic Zeus in this erotic escapade, appearing either as the agent of the god or as the god himself transformed. A glance at the serenely seductive face of the Carthage Gany- mede and that of the love-struck eagle reveals that the delicate marble orna- ment portrays the secular rather than the spiritual aspect of the myth. The designer of the Carthage group created an emotionally charged scene of seduc- tion by presenting the protagonists at the moment before the abduction, an episode seldom chosen by artists in an- tiquity. Not only did the artist render highly suggestive nuances of expression on the faces of the potential lovers, but he also used the embracing composition to greater effect than previously. In what was perhaps the most radically inventive stroke, a goat was added - an element which appears to be unique in the iconography of the myth. In so creat- ing a pastoral setting of a type familiar from the literary and visual traditions of bucolic art, the artist greatly en- hanced the eroticism of the scene. Here Ganymede, long represented by artists and poets as a herdsman, is for the first time identified quite specifically as a keeper of goats, the lowliest of herds- men, who like the beasts of their flock were also the most libidinous. A devout Christian, on the other hand, might have found a diametrically different meaning in the group. It de- picted the worst crime of Zeus, the chief of the Olympian gods - that of peder- asty, a favorite subject for denunciation by the Christian fathers. Indeed, the frontal view of the sculpture presents a more sinister aspect of the Olympian lovebird, one which could have called to the pious Christian mind the lechery and corruption of this king of gods against whom the fathers so insistently preached. In addition, by the fifth cen- tury, the goat had acquired a distinctly Christian significance as a symbol of sin and was therefore identified with the heathen. It is tempting to think that the contrast between Ganymede the goat- herd and Christ the shepherd would not have been lost on the educated African elite who delighted in such juxtaposi- tions. To what degree the Carthage sculpture might in fact have provoked comparison with Christ can only be sur- mised. Clearly, individual observers would have made their own associa- tions, depending upon the extent of their knowledge of the pagan and Chris- tian views of the myth and its artistic traditions. There now seems little reason to doubt that the delicate rendering of Ganymede was intended for the ele- gantly refurbished House of the Greek Charioteers at Carthage. There it would have found an appropriate setting amid the lavish floor mosaics which also il- lustrated pagan themes - nereids riding the backs of sea dragons, elaborate acanthus leaf borders, and a scene of four charioteers at the starting gates of the circus. In this kind of luxurious en- vironment the Carthage Ganymede was surely intended to be viewed as an ob- ject of aesthetic and intellectual, per- haps even moral provocation, rather than as an idol to be revered. For the history of art in the Theodosian period, the Ganymede sculpture - salvaged from the household refuse of ancient Carthage - opens up a new chapter de- manding further research. But it is al- ready clear that in that chapter along- side the well-known works of art in sil- ver, ivory and other media so character- istic of the domestic environment of the elite throughout the Empire, classiciz- ing sculptures such as the Carthage Ganymede will demand a prominent place. □ 60 ARCHAEOLOGY</page></plain_text>
