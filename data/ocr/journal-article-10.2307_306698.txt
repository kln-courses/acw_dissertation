<plain_text><page sequence="1">TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL ENCLOSURES IN THE POETRY OF TJUTCEV Richard Byrns, Chabot College, Valley Campus Beneath the carefully structured poetry of F. I. Tjutcev (1803-73) a reader can catch glimpses of the poet's metaphysical anxieties and existential pre- occupations. To what extent Tjutcev was influenced in this respect by the German Romantic tradition or to what extent that tradition is echoed in the poet's personal sensibilities is difficult to assess. We can be certain only that he was familiar with German Romanticism, as he spent most of the time between 1822 and 1837 in Munich where he received his first diplo- matic post at the impressionable age of nineteen. Both Ciievskij and Str6mooukhoff indicate that Tjutiev knew German literature and philoso- phy; 1 Gregg remarks that Tjutiev very likely took elements of Schelling's cosmology for his vision, although he also points out the poet's attraction to and fear of chaos before contact with Schelling.2 Tjutiev's fascination with what lies beneath the facade of the universe and those dark elements within man's inner being can be seen in the rela- tionship between the structure and form of his poetry and its content. The poet's awareness of chaos prompts him to search for some means of defining his world and thereby controlling it. Without a sense of control, the self risks being extinguished by the "eternal night" within and without. Without self-imposed barriers, the self also risks annihilation by the forces of time and space. The poet once remarked, "Jamais, je crois, personne ne s'est senti plus n6ant que moi en pr6sence de ces deux oppresseurs et tyrans de l'humanit6: le temps et l'espace." 3 Tjutiev is obsessed with the passage of time and attempts to seize a moment, take it out of time's destructive flux, frame it, and thereby preserve it. His sense of le ndant, his reaction against time and space leads him to create a temporally and spatially enclosed uni- verse. This universe is not only arranged upon a vertical axis, as Lotman points out,4 but is arranged in such a way that time and space actually form protective frames within which objects appear or actions occur. The objects, or elements, are often in the process of entering or disappearing from the enclosures. The presence or absence of life, space filled or space abandoned, is an important aspect of Tjutiev's poetics. 180 SEEJ, Vol. 21, No. 2 (1977)</page><page sequence="2">Temporal and Spatial Enclosures 181 In "Koncen pir, umolkli xory" ("The banquet has ended, the singers have fallen silent," 1850), Tjutiev uses frames in a representative way to describe man's isolation. The poem consists of a series of spatial and tem- poral enclosures which are juxtaposed as perspective is shifted. In the first stanza the poet describes a feast that has ended, sets it within an implicit temporal frame, then leads out into other frames-the sky and night. The feast recreates the feeling of a historical, perhaps Hellenistic past. Tjutiev evokes the aura of aftermath by focusing on amphoras, baskets, wine in goblets, wilted wreaths on heads, and smoking fragrances: Onopot;HeIHbI arMi0opbI, OnIIpOKHyTbI ROp31HbHI, He Aon0HTI B iy6iax BHIHBI, Ha riaBax BeHKI HII3MITBI,- JIHnUmb ypITCn apoNaTb1 B onyceTeJmefi ceTBeOfi 3aIe.5 The amphoras are empty, / The baskets overturned, / The wine still left in goblets, / On heads the wreaths are crumpled- / Only the incense still smokes / In the emptied, lighted hall. Sign objects of the feast remain and locate the event between past and present, the action of the smoking fragrances providing the transition. The symposium is also metrically enclosed: lines two through seven have no stress on the first foot. Line eight, "Kon'iv pir, my pozdno vstali" ("Having ended the banquet, we rose late," italics added), picks up line one, "Koncen pir, umolkli xory" ("The banquet has ended, the singers have fallen silent," italics added) and leads into the second part of the stanza. We immediately have three pictures. The action of the feasters suggests departure, and in line nine the scene moves outside the hall: "Zvezdy na nebe sijali" ("The stars shone in the sky"). They shine at some unapproachable, but fixed distance in the heavens. In the last line of this stanza night also provides a temporal frame, for it is stopped-caught in a moment of arrested motion: "Nod' dostigla poloviny" ("Night has reached the halfway point"). The halfway mark has been reached, but there is no further motion. Thus we have, in the first stanza, the spatial frame of the feast ended in the hall, held within the temporal frame of time past. Motion outward into the universe is held within the spatial frame of the sky and the temporal frame of arrested night. All is ordered and stable. Another series of frames in the second stanza gives a perspective on those of the first, again with two major divisions: the first part describes the city, the second moves out to the sky which roofs the city. The introductory words, "Kak nad bespokojnym gradom" ("While over the restless city"), hold the reader in suspense until the end of the stanza, where the stars establish the final limit: "Kak nad &amp;tim dol'nym Eadom / V gornom</page><page sequence="3">182 Slavic and East European Journal vysprennem predele / Zvezdy 'istye goreli" ("While above these earthly fumes / In the lofty mountain height / The pure stars burned"). The rest- less city contrasts with the silent hall. The pagan feast is a metaphor and acts much like the cities of "Rim noI'ju" ("Rome at Night," 1850 [164]) and "Venecija" ("Venice," 1844 [182]), both poems on an Italian theme. In these poems Tjutiev evokes cities in terms of their pagan glory, now long gone, "magic, but having had its day" ("Rome at Night") in this present age. The feast evokes similar associations and is set in opposition to a present-day, alienated metropolis: "Sumnym uliinym dviien'em, / S tusklo- rdjanym osvescen'em, / I bessonnymi tolpami" ("With noisy street traf- fic, / Dimly glowing, reddish lights, / And sleepless crowds"). The city image suggests ceaseless, antlike activity, and is summarized by the strophe, "Kak nad etim dol'nym Eadom" ("While above these earthly fumes"), which in parallel wording and end rhyme locks into the first line of this stanza. Cad ("fumes") refers to the "suffocating smoke of partly burned coal"; in the figurative sense it also suggests unhealthy, corrupting sur- roundings,6 and thus defines the nature of the city. It is indeed the city that suggests the abyss in this poem, for its swarming crowds and sleepless- ness hint at uncontrolled forces. The town is also set in opposition to the stars-"earthly fumes" contrast with the "mountain height" of the next line, as the poem moves outward into the firmament. The pure stars burn, "Otveiaja smertnym vzgljadam / Neporo.nymi lucami" ("Answering mor- tal glances / With immaculate rays"). They vault the earth and are fixed much like the stars in the cupola of a cathedral. Their impassibility also suggests the nature of Tjutiev's universe and the alienated position of man in that universe. The theme of isolation runs through the poem with varia- tions: the empty hall intimates man's separation from his splendid pagan past; the restless, insomniac metropolis embodies the disruptive forces that isolate him in the contemporary world; the serene stars show the indifference of the universe to his religious needs. Tjutiev also creates alternating realms of sound and silence: the quiet hall is contained in the noisy, swarm- ing city, the city in the impassible universe. These multiple enclosures can be visualized as in Diagram 1. Tjutiev not only uses temporal and spatial enclosures to express the idea of isolation, he describes the temporal shifts in frames at certain spe- cial, transitory moments ("Dekabr'skoe utro" [December Morn," 1859] and "Est' v oseni pervonaial'noj" ["At the Beginning of Autumn, 1857]. In "December Morn" (221) time is held motionless: "Na nebe mesjac-i noinaja / EEe ne tronulasja ten'" (The moon is in the sky-and the night / Shade has not yet stirred"). Night still rules: "Carit sebe . . . / Noinym sijaet toriestvom" ("It reigns . . . / And burns in nightly splen- dour"), and implicitly forms a protective vault over the earth. However,</page><page sequence="4">Temporal and Spatial Enclosures 183 beneath this static scene, "vot ui vstrepenulsja den'" ("day has already roused itself"). This past action leads to the present as day gathers force- "Luc voznikaet za luiom" ("One ray arises after another")-within the enclosure of night, and then to the future action of the last stanza: Ho ne npoRiAeT Byx-Tpex MrHoBeiiHIT, HonII ecnapaTCq Haa aeMaefi, H B IIOaH0OM 61IecIe ilpOSIBAeHHI BApyr Hac OXBaTJT nMp AHeBHORI. But let two or three moments pass, / Night will evaporate above the earth, / And in the full glory of its presence / The daily world will suddenly seize us. Verbs referring to the stability of night ("reign," "burn") give way to the future-the sky will suddenly lose its force and disappear. In opposition to night, verbs referring to day move from the past tense of being aroused, to Diagram 1 ETERNITY firmament (stars) city (lights, noise) present hall past --- - -- PastERNIfeast ETERNITY the present-tense image of gaining strength, and end in a powerful surge of force when day prevails completely. We are not allowed to see any cracks between the two temporal frames as another protective enclosure is formed. In this way Tjutiev suggests that night and day have equal power, and that one yields naturally to the other.7 In "At the Beginning of Autumn" (212) time becomes space, a limited intermediate space between seasons. The resting field ("otdyxajuscee pole")</page><page sequence="5">184 Slavic and East European Journal suggests a time of relaxation between the workings of the natural cycles. The frame is positioned, "At the beginning of autumn," the dimensions asserted ("korotkaja, no divnaja pora," "a short, but marvelous time"), then the frame is filled with crystalline days and radiant evenings: "Ves' den' stoit kak by xrustal'nyj, / I luiezarny vecera" ("The entire day seems crystal- clear, / And the evenings are radiant"). The restful present moment held in the first stanza contrasts with the active past tense of the first line of the second: "Gde bodryj serp guljal i padal kolos" ("Where the vigorous sickle strolled and the ear [of wheat] fell"). In line six, as in "The Banquet is Ended," we have a sense of an aftermath: "Teper' uZ pusto vse-prostor vezde" ("Now all is empty-open space is everywhere"). The eye is then carried away from spaciousness down into the field: "Liv' pautiny tonkij volos / Blestit na prazdnoj borozde" ("Only the fragile hair of the spider web / Shines on the idle furrow"). The delicate spider web, placed in the furrow, suggests a moment framed for an instant and protected from the flux of time. The third stanza defines the scene in terms of the future. Images of emptiness lead into suggestions that, though far off, the first winter storms are lurking: "Pusteet vozdux, ptic ne sly'no bole" ("The air grows empty, birds are no longer heard"); "No daleko e'Se do pervyx zimnix bur'- / I l'etsja 'istaja i teplaja lazur' / Na otdyxajuscee pole" ("But the first winter storms are still far off / And the pure, warm azure floats / Across the rest- ing field"). This wishful assessment of distance actually suggests that the poet is aware that the storms will soon arrive and a destructive force will replace the azure. Hence, this "short but marvelous time" is a moment held between the fruitful activity of summer and the destruction of winter. The voyage of Persephone, goddess of the underworld, is underway, her pres- ence is still felt, yet the threat of her absence is imminent. Tjut'ev expresses once more man's inability to control nature, the world external to himself which thwarts his efforts by its very impassibility. The enclosures of the poem can be represented as in Diagram 2. Tjutiev also creates protective enclosures away from the turbulent world. He fills and gives order to these refuges through his arrangement of objects, then shows some external force entering and affecting the scene. Man's relationship to time and space is once more evidenced in such poems as "Cache-Cache" (1828) and "Ital'janskaja villa" ("Italian Villa," 1837). In "Cache-Cache" (54) the poet associates a delicate butterfly with the spirit of his absent beloved. The action of the poem takes place within an enclosed room, with one window opening out into a natural scene. Objects are positioned: the harp in the corner, roses and carnations at the window, the afternoon ray dozing on the floor. A sense of time held pervades the room, a still-life barely rippled by the trembling of the harp, with only sus-</page><page sequence="6">Temporal and Spatial Enclosures 185 picions of an eclipsed sound. Suddenly the delicate balance between time held and active present is tipped-a butterfly enters and flits from flower to flower, filling the room with both presence and motion. The poet seems to recognize the spirit of his love in this natural creature: "0, polno kruzit'sja, moj gost' dorogoj! / Mogu li vozdu'nyj, tebja ne uznat'?" ("Oh, enough circling, my dear guest! / Could I not recognize you in your lightness?"). This final recognition reestablishes the balance and completes the arrange- ment of an enclosed universe. Diagram 2 azure field furrow SUMMER WINTER spider web But the function of life entering is not always benevolent as in "Cache- Cache." At times it results in the disruption and destruction of sacred, cherished space, with a suggestion of both order and death. In "Italian Villa" (130) the poet creates a protected world, then describes the desecra- tion of its quietude by the turbulence of life. The poem shows how Tjutcev builds up multiple enclosures in an attempt to keep everything under con- trol, and shows also that such control is at best shaky, for the chaotic forces of surging life can neither be enclosed nor subjugated. The first four stanzas are built upon the complexes of enclosure-protection, sleep-death-dream. In the first stanza they are set up on a horizontal level: the sleeping villa is sheltered by the cypress grove, traditionally associated with death, from the turbulence of existence, "s trevogoju ?itejskoj" ("from life's anxiety"). In the second stanza, the poet encloses the villa vertically between heaven and earth. The dreaming villa, located in "a flowery vale," gives itself to the friendly power of the heavens. The third and fourth stanzas contirme this heaven-earth opposition and accentuate the villa's unity with nature: a fountain murmurs in a corner, a breeze and swallow share the space of a room. The swallow, a symbolic harbinger of spring, acts much like the butterfly in "Cache-Cache," which enters the enclosed space and brings nature with it.</page><page sequence="7">186 Slavic and East European Journal At this point, the fifth stanza, "we"-perhaps the poet and his beloved s -are permitted a glimpse of the magic space of protected solitude: "Vse bylo tak spokojno! / Tak vse ot veka mirno i temno!" ("All was so quiet! / As though all was peaceful and dark for centuries!"). The villa is implicitly a sacred temple.9 Life, sleep, and death then combine: the babbling of the fountain contrasts with the stillness of the cypress, which shelters the villa from the outside world, looks in the window, and thereby partakes of the entire scene. Like an excavation, an ancient temple, the Italian villa is unearthed from the past, only to be desecrated by human life. After the crossing of the threshold the row of dotted lines before the last two stanzas suggests an instant held between cause and effect. Then follows the impact of a catalytic force. This force is life, "Ta zlaja .izn', s ee mjateinym iarom" ("That evil life, in its rebellious fervor"), which is always outside. Life here implies chaos and turbulence, those dark primeval elements of man's inner being which may destroy the protective structure of existence.10 The enclosures in this poem are both temporal and spatial. They are temporal, for the villa is enclosed in past time, which is then disrupted. Spatial enclosures are both horizontal and vertical. The space of the villa is filled and ordered by fountain, window, and swallow. The villa is pro- tected from life by the cypress grove. The villa is also in a flowery vale, guarded by the overhanging arch of the heavens. In this whole complex structure, objects are positioned and the world completely ordered, even while the world is being shattered by the uncontrolled elements of life. "Italian Villa" can be illustrated as in Diagram 3. Diagram 3 heavens nature-wind bird\ grove wind fountain valley villa life"</page><page sequence="8">Temporal and Spatial Enclosures 187 Hence, in Tjutiev's poetry either frames replace frames, as in "Decem- ber Morn," or enclosures receive some outside force, which may complete their space or destroy them. In other poems, Tjutiev describes a voyage out- ward into the distance, but delimits it in some way. One example of this may be found in his later love lyrics, where the lovers' journey continues indefinitely. In "Na Neve" ("On the Neva," 1850 [167]) the light ripple of the Neva reflects the star above, as it carries the little world of the skiff with its "two phantoms" far away. There is a timeless quality to the poem-the voyage is ever repeated, as suggested by the first stanza: H onsIIT nea3Be3 HbIpaeT B er]KOi 3M614 HeBCKHII BOJH. H OInarTs Ao60oBs nBepieT Eit TaIIHCTBeHHbII CBOi 9IleIH. And again the star dives / Within the light ripple of the Neva's waves, / And again love entrusts to it / Her mysterious skiff. The word prizraki, "phantoms," used to designate the lovers, suggests that they partake of the night and lends an aura of unreality to the scene. Space is defined vertically by the star and its reflection, and horizontally by the rippling waves which continually mirror the star. The lovers float through this corridor into an endless distance on the Neva's waves, compared at the end of the poem to the sea, which the poet evokes as their shelter. Motion outward, however, does not necessarily lead somewhere. In "On the Neva" the lovers travel with no real goal in sight. In "Volna i duma" ("Wave and Thought, 1851 [178]), Tjutiev uses the sea image to intimate that no matter where one is, doubts always arise: B cepAAe ans TeCHOM, B 6ea6pe HoM an H pe, 3Aecb-B SaKacIoqelH, TaM-Ha upocTope, TOT e BCe Be1HBi lIpuI6oH iI OT601i, TOT e npi3paKR TpeBom~0o-nycTofi. Whether enclosed in the heart, or in the boundless sea, / Here-in confinement, there-in open space, / Always the same eternal rise and fall, / The same anguishedly empty ghost. Gregg has pointed out that the poem finds its tragic counterpart in a poem written fifteen years later, "Est i v moem stradal'6eskom zastoe" ("In My Suffering Stagnation," 1865 [241]). Here Tjutiev compares himself to a "razbityj 'eln, zabro'ennyj volnoju, / Na bezymennom dikom beregu" ("a broken skiff, thrown by the wave, / On a nameless, wild shore"). The forces of destruction finally shatter the deceptively safe world of the skiff. (Gregg, 181.) In "Ja ljuteran ljublju bogosluien'e" ("I Love the Divine Service of the Lutherans, 1834 [95]) the poet at first appears to be attracted</page><page sequence="9">188 Slavic and East European Journal by the severe rite of the Lutherans: "Obrjad ix strogij, vainyj i prostoj" ("Their stern, grave, and simple rite") within the bare walls of the temple. The first stanza, however, is given a twist by the rest of the poem, which is a meditation upon the imminent departure of Faith-something which plagued Tjutiev himself.'l The poem can be seen as a negative analogue of the Protestant denial of self and material world, which leads a believer through the straight and narrow gate to heaven. Casting off the comforting rituals and religious artifacts which kept Christianity closer to its pagan past and to an anthropomorphic conception of the Divine, the poet sees the ultimate negation of self culminating ironically in the departure of Faith herself. She is poised on the threshold, enclosed in time and space by the door frame of the temple. This final image might well be compared to the departure of night in "December Morn." But whereas in that poem day will arrive and one frame will replace another, here Faith leaves nothing in Her place. Commentary upon this work might be found in two other religious poems, "Na' vek" ("Our Century," 1851) and "I grob opuS6en ui v mogilu" ("The Coffin is Already Lowered into the Grave," 1836). In "Our Cen- tury" (177) the image is ironically reversed-man without faith feels his need, but refuses to ask for it: He caxeT B3Bec, c MOJIIT3BOH II ce3oil KaR HH CeOp6HT nepeA 3amKHyToi ABepMo: "BnycTH MeHn !--fl nepio, 6o0e Moiw! IpHRAn ua noolb Mo:oeMy neBepLo !" He will not say, as long as he lives, with prayer and tears, / However he may grieve before the closed door: / "Let me in!-I believe, my God! / Come to relieve my unbelief!" The once protective enclosures have now become separating walls, and man is excluded from the Temple of Faith, God's Mansion. In "The Coffin is Already Lowered into the Grave" (103) man's faith is inadequate. Earthly images are of closeness and repression-the coffin, the open grave, the people crowded about, the sense of decay. The pastor stands at the head of the coffin to deliver a sermon on "brennost' 6elove6'ju, / Grexopaden'e, krov' Xrista" ("the mortality of humanity / The Fall, the Blood of Christ"). However, the poem again comments ironically upon religious beliefs, spe- cifically those of the Protestants, for instead of the pastor's learned speech rising to heaven, the entire funeral scene is set apart from the dividing and indifferent blue: A ne60 Ta~ HeT2eHHo-'ICTo, TaK 6ecnpeAe1Hno HaA senxefi.

Objects are arranged in vertical layers-the grave, the mourners, the swarm- ing birds, the sky. The freely flying birds ignore the people huddled about the coffin. The grave, an ominous image of enclosure, is placed in opposition to something perhaps more fearful, the open "abyss" of the sky. Outward motion leads not to a celestial vault, but, as in "The Banquet Has Ended," to the infinite blue, whose purity and impassibility contrast with the hopes and desires of mortals on earth. Thus, although technically there seems to be no organic progression in the poetry of Tjutcev, the stripping away of the various layers of sheltering space and time can be seen as a voyage through the poet's anxieties and preoccupations-isolation, love, separation, religious faith. This voyage also involves the definition of man's existence in relation to time and space. It is expressed with utmost simplicity in one of Tjutiev's last poems, "Brat, stol'ko let soputstvova'ij mne" ("Brother, How Many Years You Accom- panied Me," 1870 [288]), written upon the death of his brother: H o ro iH CTOSJT TyT OA~OMy?

And how long shall I stand here alone? / A day, another year-and there will be nothing, / Where I am now, looking into night darkness / And-I do not realize myself what is happening to me. Everything disappears without a trace-and it is so easy not to exist! / Whether I am here or not-what does it matter? / All will be the same-the snowstorm will howl in the same way, / And around will be the same gloom, the same steppe on all sides. This is the hour of humility and infinite pain. All attempt at control has been in vain. Frames have dissolved, time has become indistinct ("a day, another year"), "the same gloom, the same steppe" are not enclosing, but infinite. There is ultimately no refuge, no protection from extinction. In the last stanza, the poet imagines himself standing "Na rokovoj . .. o6eredi" ("In the fatal line") of humanity, realizing that he has no definition of self outside of "ces deux oppresseurs de l'humanit6-le temps et l'espace." But time and space are impassible elements destined to remain forever independent of him.</page><page sequence="11">190 Slavic and East European Journal NOTES 1 D.
