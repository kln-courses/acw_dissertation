<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hermeneutics of Irony: Lady Reason and the Romance of the Rose Christine Me Webb ^» he Romance of the Rose, a literary bastion of the French High Middle Ages, has / been the subject of praise and controversy alike among its contemporary readers as well as in modern scholarship.1 Arguably, it is in particular the hermeneutic elements of allegory and irony in Jean de Meun's continuation of Guillaume de Lorris's dream vision which have captured the critical reader's attention.2 In length and reception Guillaume's work clearly finds itself grossly overshadowed by Jean de Meun's summa of digressive discourses "ou Tart d'Amors est tote enclose" (which contain[s] the entire art of Love) (37).3 The protagonist Lover's first teacher in his amorous quest is the ambiguous allegory of Lady Reason. A lot of ink has been spilled discussing the element of irony in her discourse. Surprisingly, however, her lengthy discussion on the various forms of love and the relationship between word and thing, though at the centre of many a study on the Rose, has largely been discarded from this debate. Paul Zumthor for instance sees the subversion of Guillaume's conventional dream allegory in Jean's continuation as a "global figure of irony" (202). The Robertsonian school points out the element of irony in Jean de Meun's work stating at the same time, however, that Reason's and Nature's discourses ought to be read on a literal level.4 in what is to follow, I will argue that Reason's amatory and linguistic theories point not only to the trope oîantiphrasis, as has repeatedly been stated, but that it is semiotic and referential ambiguity which are at the centre of the multifaceted irony inherent in this allegory's persona on the one hand, and verbal artifact on the other. Ultimately, then, satire, as discussed most 1 For studies on the reception of the Romance of the Rose, see Pierre-Yves Badel, Le roman de la rose au XWe siècle. Etude de la réception de l'oeuvre (Geneva: Droz, 1980); Karl August Ott, Der Rosenroman. Erträge der Forschung (Darmstadt, 1980); and Sylvia Huot, The Romance of the Rose and Its Medieval Readers: Interpretation, Reception, Manuscript Transmission (Cambridge (UK): Cambridge UP, 1993). Undeniably, the quarrel about Jean de Meun's Rose, which took place between 1401 and 1403 between Christine de Pizan and Jean Gereon and the work's proponents Jean de Montreuil and the brothers Gontier and Pierre Col, is the best known example of the kind of reaction the Rose could provoke. See Eric Hick's excellent edition of Christine's compilation of the debate correspondence, Le débat sur le Roman de la rose. 2 To mention here are of course John Fleming's two studies on the Rose, firstly The Roman de la rose: A Study in Allegory and Iconography (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton UP, 1969); and secondly Reason and the Lover. Allan Gunn's influential A Mirror of Love; A Reinterpretation of the Romance of the Rose (Lubbock: Texas Tech P, 1952) has shaped much of the subsequent debate on the topic, such as David Hult's article 'Lan&amp;iage and Dismemberment: Abelard, Origen, and the Romance of the Rose" in Kevin Brownlee and Sylvia Huot (eds.), Rethinking the Romance of the Rose.

Dalhousie French Studies 69 (2004) -3-</page><page sequence="2">4 Christine Me Webb recently by Alastair Minnis, though crucial to the role of Reason, is not the exclusive means by which a comic effect is created.5 At first glance, Lady Reason, as a proponent of rational thought, seemingly casts aside passionate love altogether and thus personifies her allegorical signification. It is because of this standpoint that her instruction does not meet with Lover's approval and that he does not take her up on the challenge to understand the essence of her message: [e]t qui bien entendroit la letre, le sen verroh en l'escriture, qui esclarcist la feble occure. La venté dedenz reposte seroit clere, s 'el iert esposte . . . (7132-36) And the person who would understand the literal meaning properly, would uncover àie profound meaning in the text which then would explain the obscure feble. The truth which is hidden there would be beautiful, if only it could be revealed. . .6 Unfortunately, Lover has no time to investigate further preoccupied, as he is, to find a way to get past the guardians of the tower where his beloved Rose is imprisoned. The reader, on the other hand, finds him-/herself intrigued to get to the bottom of the 'truth' hidden beneath her words. If successful, we will be rewarded by learning it which is a promise already made by Guillaume de Lorris's Reason in the first Rose: "La vérité, qui est coverte, vos sera lores toute overte" (2071- 72) (The truth which is covered/ will then be completely open for you). Contrary to Lover, many a reader has persevered in the quest of interpretation and understanding not only of Reason's intriguing words but of Jean de Meun's continuation as a whole. This task is made difficult by allegorical language quite obviously pointing to a polysemous reading of the text. The commonly accepted rhetorical device of allegory during the High and the later Middle Ages was considered a trope of anthropomorphism, a means to encode a message, saying one thing and meaning another. Heavily borrowing from biblical exegesis, allegory was a way, as Boccaccio put it, to disguise the truth of the divine word from the "gaze of the irreverent," unworthy of understanding the higher levels of the word, such as the metaphorical, allegorical, and anagogical (59-60).7 Dante emphasizes this semiotic hierarchy in his Commedia, thus establishing a vertical reading of allegory, almost casting away the literal level altogether. Modern scholarship has largely taken up this interpretation of the trope of allegory as a means to read a text polysemously as one layer of meaning is superimposed on the next. Maureen Quilligan succinctly shows in her work The Language of Allegory that 5 In particular in chapter 2 of his work, Minnis offers an analysis of the satirical discourse in Jean de Meun's Rose followed in chapter 3 by a discussion of Lady Reason's metalinguistic speech on the relationship between words and their referents. Evidently, Minnis 's monograph on the topic surpasses the more limited scope of my article. Given the density and complexity of irony in the Rose, I will focus my remarks on this literary device in Reason's discourse. For the satirical undertones in Jean de Meun's text, though unquestionably a crucial aspect in many parts of this works, I refer the reader to Miimis's study. 6 As Armand Strubel points out in his edition of the Rose, this passage relies on the hermeneutic terminology of biblical exegesis where 'letre' and 'sen' correspond to littera and sen ten tia, as the literal or semantic meaning as opposed to the author's intention, Le roman de la rose (399 n. 1 ). 7 For a more exhaustive study of Boccaccio's understanding of allegory, see Maureen Quilligan, The Language of Allegory. Defining the Genre, 27. I alro refer to Friedrich Ohly's work Schriften zur mittelalterlichen Bedeutungsforschung (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1977).</page><page sequence="3">The Romance of the Rose 5 rather than adopting medieval hermeneutics, as D.W. Robertson has done for instance,8 "it would be more precise to say. . .that allegory works horizontally. . .so that meaning accretes serially, interconnecting and criss-crossing the verbal surface. . ." (28). Coming back to Lady Reason's discourse in Jean de Meun's Rose then, I posit that it is precisely this kind of hermeneutic agency that Lady Reason implies when she instructs us how to read her words. Like the other allegories, Reason, already by way of her allegorical designation, responds to the reader's expectancy to read the text on several levels. However, rather than unveiling a superimposition of meanings, it is perhaps our task to reconstruct the layered semiotic interaction and the intratextuality of her discourse.10 The incessant attempts to define 'irony' dating back to its Greek etymon of eironeia prove that irony cannot simply be reduced to a semantic opposition of meanings, where the figurative implies the opposite of what has been said.11 As has recently been suggested by Philippe Hamon, irony works on several diegetic levels, and a distinction must be made between semiotic and referential irony, that is to say, irony functions on the level of speech and of discourse alike (13). Susan Stakel adds a third distinction with what she terms Socratic irony as a stylistic means spanning the other two, semiotic and referential irony.12 Allegory is naturally particularly suitable for the infiltration of irony into a text creating the rhetorical device of what Quintillian labelled illusion As mentioned earlier, modern scholarship has mainly focussed on the antithetical nature of Lady Reason's speech fittingly introduced, as it is, by a tirade of oxymoron stretching over 70 lines, as she attempts to define love to the baffled Lover: Or i met bien l'entencion, voiz an ci la descripción. Amors, ce est pez haineuse, Amors, c'est haine amoureuse ...(4261-64) Pay careful attention, here is the description of it. Love is hateful peace, love is amorous hatred. . . And it goes on from there.14 Yet, this passage could also be read as a warning to Lover and, on an extradiegetic level, to the reader, that what is to follow demands an extensive hermeneutic involvement, if we want to grasp the essence of her message. Reason repeatedly insists on the importance of language and on the relationship between word and thing and word and deed. Pretending to instruct Lover in her amatory doctrine, she engages him in a lengthy dialectic modeled after contemporary 8 In A Preface to Chaucer, Robertson posits that the "incoherence of the surface materials is almost essential to the formation of the abstract pattern, for if the surface materials - the concrete elements in the figures - were consistent or spontaneously satisfying in an emotional way, there would be no stimulus to seek something beyond them" 56. 9 For a detailed explanation of her reading of allegory, see The Language of Allegory. 25- 29. 1 0 Though my analysis of the interaction between Reason and Lover contradicts in many points Fleming's argument, I do agree with his reading of Lover in his role as Reason's inadequate pupil. 1 1 The complexity of this literary device continues to be one of the more prevalent subjects of literary and linguistic theory and criticism. I therefore mention only a few exemplary works which attempt to define irony and to describe its multifaceted usage. An appropriate starting point for its definition in medieval rhetoric is the Enciclopedia dantesca (Rome: Istituto Della Enciclopedia Italiana, 1970-76). Further, I refer to D.C. Muecke, The Compass of Irony (London: Methuen, 1969); and Ernst Behler, Klassische Ironie, romantische Ironie, tragische Ironie: Zum Ursprung dieser Begriffe (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1981). 1 2 For Stakel's definition, see pp. 94- 1 04. 1 3 Institutio Oratoria (VI: ii, 15-16). Also quoted in Stakel, 95. 14 Evidently, this passage has been copied and translated from Alain de Lille's De Planem naturae in an attempt to show the intrinsic contradictory qualities of passionate love, or as Daniel Poirion put it: "H s'agit en effet de résoudre les contradictions que fait ressortir la définition de l'amour comme union des contraires. . ." (154).</page><page sequence="4">6 Christine Me Webb university education, as Daniel Poirion informs us,15 on the use of literal versus figurative language. This debate was initially set off by Lover's fierce objection to Lady Reason's use of obscene language referring specifically to her mention of the word 'aillions' without euphemism (5507). Reason and Lover's discussion on the veracity and expressiveness of language itself evidently takes up the old question of the meaning of the word which shaped Greek thought and sums up the essential ingredient of Catholic scholasticism of the Middle Ages. For Plato, as he states in the Cratylus, truth cannot be expressed through words, and its purity exists by itself (438d-439b). in contrast to Greek Platonic thought, religious scholars during the shaping centuries of the Catholic Church focussed on the mystery of the Trinity, arriving at the only possible conclusion that the Word became Flesh through divine spiritual interference. This argument is also taken up implicitly by the famous conclusion of Pygmalion's successfully placed request before Venus at the end of Jean de Meun's Rose. With the metamorphosis of inert matter, that is Pygmalion's statue, into a living being, the word has become alive and attempts to escape its referential stability. Let us not forget that Reason herself claims to be, in Augustinian terms, the founder of language, It is she who ". . . mis les nons aus choses" (7079) (gave. . .names to. . .things), as she herself states in her defence of having been accused of using obscene language: [m]es il vost que nons leur trovasse a mon plesir et les nomasse proprement et conmunement por craistre nostre entendement; et la parole me dona, ou moût tres precieus don a. (7061-66) But [God] wanted me to find names for them as I please and that I name them properly and with names commonly accepted, in order to increase our understanding, and he gave me speech, a very precious gift. The often cited passage where she refers to the male genitals without euphemism overtly reveals her opinion on the topic. Yet, Reason's insistence that language was given to her by God tarnishes her credibility in the matter, since she consequently ought to be able to answer the eternal question of the relationship between word and thing, discussed already, for instance, by Cratylus and Socrates (Cratylus, 435d-438c). Her inadequate explanation is that it is God who created all things, but that he gave her the power to name them, which she did, in order to assure understanding and proper communication among all human beings. Therefore, there is no harm in calling things by their names, rather than by euphemisms as women do when referring to the male sexual organs. At the same time, she stresses the arbitrariness of the sign and the absence of relation between word and thing as she admits that 'coules' ('aillions') could be called 'reliques' ('relics') or vice versa. 'Reliques' is of course the term used later on in the narrative to describe the sacred intact vagina of the young virgin. 15 Poirian states that Jean de Meun's entire continuation takes up the scholastic tradition of contemporary university teachings, namely the trivium taught, so to speak, by Reason, as she touches on rhetoric, grammar and logic as well as the quadrivium which is encompassed in the multiple digressions which follow (127-28).</page><page sequence="5">The Romance of the Rose 7 It is precisely this disputano on the proper16 use of language in the context of Reason's lineage and direct relation to God that causes great confusion as to the role of her persona, and, ultimately, I would argue, it is this semiotic ambiguity which creates the comic effect of irony. As the "inventress of language," she ought to speak a divinely inspired language signifying the innermost truth. Quite to the contrary, however, it is in her role as the founder of language that her persona appears problematic. On the one hand she claims that her speech is to be taken at face value, "Or te demonstreré sanz fàble/chose qui n'est pas demonstrable/. . ." (4249-50) (Now I will show you without speaking in febles/ something which cannot be shown/. . .). She then goes on to state that even though most women use euphemisms when speaking of the male sexual organ, such as "borses, harnais, riens, piches, pines" (7113) (purses, harnesses, things, thorns, needles), she prefers to name them by their right name: "[m]es a riens nule ne m'efforce,/quant riens veill dire apertement,/tant conme a parler proprement" (7120-22) (But I attempt above all/when I want to express something clearly/ to speak in proper terms). On the other hand, she insists a few lines later that one should never take her words à la lettre: "En ma parole autre sen ot,/au mains quant des coulons parloie..." (7127-28) (There was another meaning in my speech/at least when I talked of aillions...). Further adding to the confusion, when asked to define love, she claims: "Lors t'avré le neu desnoé,/que tourjorz trouveras noè" (4259-60) (Then, I shall have untied the knot for you/which you will always find tied). This image is once again ambiguous, pointing, as it does, to the oath of loyalty, which Lover has sworn to the God of Love, thus symbolizing the knot by which he is tied to his master. Coincidentally, as Lover seems incapable of understanding her words, this metaphor might signify at the same time the hidden meaning of her message which, it seems, can only be untied by the inventress of language herself. Not succeeding then in defining love in a convincing manner for Lover and foiling to defend herself for her use of improper speech, she proceeds to refer her pupil, whom she accuses of not understanding her argument, to the poets' works, specifically Ovid's moralization, to which she undoubtedly alludes when she talks about the "integumanz aus poetes" (poets' arguments) (7138).17 It is there where her pupil will find the philosophers' speculations hidden in myths and fables. As mentioned earlier, Lover has more important things on his mind and postpones his study of the auctores. He grows more and more impatient with his teacher as she fails to convince him of her doctrine on the art of love despite her numerous rhetorical strategies. Language, as Reason tells us herself referring to Plato, ought to be used "por enseignier et por aprendre" (7072) (to teach and to learn), which, consequently, turns Reason into a poor teacher and she must be dismissed: Mes je vos ai bien dit sovent que je ne veill ailleurs penser qu'a la rose ou sunt mi penser; et quant ailleurs penser me fetes par voz paroles ci retretes, 1 6 According to Minnis 'parler proprement' signified a langage "which is direct and to the point as opposed to being oblique or circumlocutory, clearly and plainly significative rather than elaborately (or indeed obscurely) metaphorical." As he claims, "In the scholarship of [Jean de Meun's and Chaucer's] day, the adjective 'proper' was often used to describe the discourse of cool and rational science, no-nonsense logical language as opposed to the fables of the poets on the one hand and the loose, untechnical speech of the common herd on the other" (132). 17 Althougi this reference to the auctores is ambiguous at best, one possibility, as Maureen Quilligan concluded, could be a reference to John of Garland's Integumento Ovidii, poemetto inedito del secolo XIII where Saturn's castration and the change it brougit about is also mentioned as it is, of course, in the Rose (in "Allegory, Allegoresis, and the Deallegorization of Language" (166-67).</page><page sequence="6">8 Christine Me Webb que je sui ja touz las (Tour, ja m'en verrez de ci foïr, se ne vos en taisiez a tant, puis que mes queurs ailleurs s'atant (7190-98) But often have I told you that I do not want to think about anything else than the rose where my thoughts are right now. And if you make me think about something else with the words you have brought forth here and which I am already tired of hearing, you will see me flee should you not be quiet at once because my heart is attached elsewhere. Instead, Lover vows loyalty to Cupid, the corrupt God of Love, and his army and turns for advice to his subsequent interlocutors, such as Friend and the Old Woman. Reason's ambiguous and confusing linguistic tactics, namely the constant shift between the literal and the allegorical, are underscored and brought to the fore by the correlation between meaning and sound, in the rhythmical interplay of rimes. In a reading of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili dating from the end of the fifteenth century, Giorgio Agamben concludes that "the more a work seems to concentrate on philological and linguistic problems, the denser its truth content may be" (44). Agamben's statement, which appears in the chapter fittingly titled "The Dream of Language," seems commensurate with Reason's theorization of the relation between word and thing. Apart from the striking frequency of homophones, to which I will turn in a moment, it is Reason's defence of having named aillions literally without dressing the word in the disguise of the gloss, that must retain the reader's attention. Immediately after having proclaimed discretion the primordial virtue and, at the same time, raising Lover's hopes that her incessant digressions will finally come to an end, Reason launches a lengthy metatextual justification of why it is her right and her duty to name things literally. Thus, she acts contrary to her own advice, which is after all backed by Cato himself, and which she implores Lover to observe: Chaton meïsmes s 'i acorde, s'il est qui son livre recorde. La peuz en escrit trover tu que la prumereine vertu, c'est de metre a sa langue frain: donte donc la teue . . . (7023-28) Cato himself agrees on this point, if we recall his book. There you can find written that the primordial virtue is to hold back one's tongue. So, tame yours. Continuing however with the oppositional conjunction 'mais', Reason is far from being finished her speech. A few lines later she informs us: Dex, li cortais sanz vilenie, et m'a norrie et enseigniee, ne m'en tien a maie enseigniee, ainceis m'aprist ceste maniere. Par son gré sui je coutumiere de parler proprement des choses, quant il me plest, sanz metre gloses. Et quant me reveuz opposer</page><page sequence="7">The Romance of the Rose 9 tu, qui me requiere de gloser - veuz opposer? ainceis m'opposes que, tout ait Dex fetes les choses, au meins ne fist il pas le non, ce te respoing: espoir que non, . . . (7043-56) God who is courteous and lacking villainy, and who has raised and educated me, and I do not think that I am poorly educated, on the contrary, it is He who taught me the habit of speaking literally of things when it pleases me, without glossing. And you who object to this and require me to gloss - what are you opposed to? Although it is God who created the things, he did not name them. Here is my response to you: maybe he did not... I interrupt this citation in mid-sentence in order to better focus on the rime scheme. Beginning in line 7045 we have a repetition of "enseigniee," a renewed emphasis on Reason's role as a teacher, followed three lines further down by "choses - gloses - opposer - gloser - opposes - choses - non - non" (7049-56), the two last endings being homophones of 'name' and the negative 'not' which Reason already used in lines 6917- 18, again in the context of naming things. Leaving aside for a moment the metaphysical and philosophical discussion of the origin of the word, I suggest that Reason's own contradictory linguistic theory is further underlined by the rime scheme of these line endings with their insistence on glossing, or rather of not glossing. This conjunction of rimes could be seen then as a self-reflection on Reason's verbal artifact as a whole, where rather than affording us an explanation of her doctrine, we are required to discern it in the semiotic interaction of meanings. We will now return to the homophones mentioned above. The repetition of the word "pechié" in lines 6922, 6925 and 6926 implies the notion of blasphemy, especially when read in connection with the following homophones "enviz" and "en viz" (6935-36) and "vit" and "vit" (7087-88). The complete lines are as follows: ". . .car volentiers, non pas enviz,/mist Dex en coulons et en viz/force de generación. . ." (Because deliberately and not against his will God placed the power of generation in cullons and penis. . .), and "Coilles est biaus nons et si l'ains,/si sunt par foi coillon et vit,/onc nus plus biaus guieres ne vit" (Cullion is a beautiful name and I like it thus. And, my God, it is the same with cullion as with penis, nobody has ever seen anything more beautiful).18 Though clearly exposing the notion of sin, Reason herself does not succumb to it as she praises the name of the male sexual organs as being the most perfect word; that is to say her positivistic preference is mirrored in her attempt to (pro-)create textual meaning. And this act of engendering meaning is much more fertile if no explicit commentary is provided, In other words, coming back to the previous quote, glossing, which is essential if we want to avoid ambiguity, should be discarded altogether. To continue this thought, Reason's enthusiasm about the subject matter cannot be interpreted without reference to the broader narrative and must be read in the context of the portrayal of her persona and within the main plot which is, after all, the Lover's attempt to pluck the beloved rose. Even here, at the more global narrative level, Reason does not entirely present herself to Lover as a personification of rational thought. Rather, and here we move to the level of referential irony, she portrays herself as a coquette, seductive woman, an attribute so alien to her usual austere allegorical function: "Sui je pas bêle dame et gente,/digne de servir un preudome,/et fust enpereres 1 8 In order to illustrate the 'dirty talk' which is implied by Lover's and then later Christine de Pizan's and Jean Gerson's offense, the terms 'coilles1 and 'vit' could also be rendered as 'balls' and 'cock' (see Minnis, 88 and footnote 12, p. 122).</page><page sequence="8">10 Christine McWebb de Rome?' (5768-70) (Am I not a beautiful and noble lady/worthy to serve a nobleman/and be he the Emperor of Rome?). Unfortunately, our hero remains unmoved and refutes her proposal to serve her rather than the corrupt God of Love. This rejection is echoed by his disbelief in Reason's courtly attributes: Si ne vos tiegn pas a cortaise quant ci m'avez coilles nomees, qui ne sunt pas bien renomees en bouche a cortaise pucele. (6898-901) I do not consider you courtly having pronounced the word 'aillions.' They do not belong in the mouth of a courtly maiden. Applying the courtly paradigm to describe the lack of positive attributes in Lady Reason's character shifts her allegorical signification further into the realm of irony, as the reader recognizes the flagrant similarities between her and the coquette Duenna who, with her bawdy advice, instructs Lover in her own version of ars amatoris. The essence of the latter's counsel is, in turn, that women can be bought with flattery and expensive gifts. Moreover and perhaps more importantly, the above-mentioned series of homophonic rimes underscores the leitmotiv of Jean's Rose as a promotional treatise of procreative love versus the chaste, regulated courtly love enacted in the first Rose, In the context of sinful behaviour the juxtaposition of "enviz" (against one's will) and "en viz" (in the penis) on the one hand, and of "vit" (penis) and "vit" (has seen) on the other creates an intratextual link to the dialogue between Genius and Nature which appears roughly 10000 lines later towards the conclusion of the book. Nature, of course, sides with the God of Love in his promotion of fornication and the banning of chastity from the world. After all, those who do not use their "ostiz" (19669) [tools] to their full potential and instead aspire to chastity in order to please God will cause the extinction of the world and counteract natural procreation.19 We are reminded here of Reason's insistence that it is no sin to name by their name all the 'instruments' which God created in paradise for the sustenance of the human race: [n']encor ne fez je pas pechié seje nome les nobles choses par plein texte sanz metre gloses, que mes peres en paradis fist de ses propres mains jadis, et touz les autres estrumenz qui sunt pilers et argumenz a soutenir nature humaine . . .(6926-33) I do not commit a sin, however, if I call literally without glossing all the noble things which my Father made in Paradise with his own hands, together with all the other instruments which are the pillars and the arguments sustaining human nature. 1 9 Genius in his sermon uses numerous metaphors for the male sexual organ as for instance the phallic symbolism in his reference to the tripartite division of human activity the intellectual symbolized by writing with a stylet, the artisan, forging with hammers and the laborer plowing the furrows.</page><page sequence="9">The Romance of the Rose 1 1 It is in Nature's interest to promote the use of the "ostiz" in order to assure procreation to which any sort of moral and, consequently, courtly inhibition becomes a menace. On this point at least Reason and Nature agree. In order for Cupid's barons and with them, ultimately, Lover to be successful in their defeat of Christian and courtly morality, it is preponderant to tackle above all the female virtue of chastity. With the allegory of Chastity present, a successful outcome of the main plot, the plucking of the rosebud, cannot be guaranteed. Coincidentally, the manifestation of chaste behaviour forms an integral part of courtly love, not to mention of the popular hierarchy of vices and virtues promulgated by Christian theology, and thus represents the most cumbersome obstacle for Cupid and his army as well as, by extension, for Nature's amatory doctrine. It comes as no surprise then that Cupid's mother Venus rushes to support her son's army before its imminent defeat and wages war with Chastity condemning her with the following words: Male mort, dist eie, m'aqueure, qui tantost me puist acourer, se je ja mes les demourer Chasteé en fame vivant, tant aut Jalousie estrivant! Trop souvant an grant peine an somes. Biau filz, jurez ausine des homes qu'il saudront tuit par noz santiers. (15800-07) She said: 'May evil death besiege me, if I allow henceforth that Chastity may live in a woman, no matter how much Jealousy may strive! Too often we have suffered from this. Dear son, swear that all men will move towards our paths.' Chastity and her interconnected virtues, Shame, Fear and Danger, are subsequently attacked and flee as the castle is engulfed in flames. We must remember that Shame was introduced in Guillaume de Lorris's Rose as the daughter of Lady Reason who, together with her mother, formed an alliance with Chastity against Venus.20 Yet, with this much opposition, Chastity does not stand a chance and is quickly defeated as are her disciples, finally enabling the conquest of the young maid by Lover. By extension, then, this defeat sheds yet again a rather dubious light on the virtuous qualities of Lady Reason. Reading the genealogical lineage of Shame and her direct relation to Chastity in the context of Reason's and Nature's comments on procreation leads us to conclude that Reason seems far less opposed to natural procreation than initially assumed. Although rejected by Lover as a suitable teacher in the art of love and mocked by the God of Love, who insults her and calls her a recreant wretch, Reason's 3000 line speech is consequently central in gaining an interpretative understanding of Jean de Meun's Mirror for Lovers: [c]ar tant en lira proprement que tretuit cil qui ont a vivre devroient apeler ce livre le Miroër ans Amoreus, tant i verront de bien por eu, mes que Reson n'i sait creüe, la chetive, la recreüe. (10618-24) 20 I refer to lines 2821-41.</page><page sequence="10">12 Christine Me Webb Because, when read properly, all those who have yet to live should call this book the Mirror for Lovers because of all the good things they will see for themselves in it, but Reason, the recreant wretch, shall not be believed. If we view her discourse as the interaction of textual layers constructing an artifice of semiotic and referential irony, the necessity for turning Reason into one of the key players of Jean's digressive plot makes sense. Christine de Pizan, for one, fiercely criticizing Jean de Meun's Rose during and after the quarrel about the Romance of the rose (1401-03), seems to have shared this reading. Id her epistle to Jean de Montreuil, Provost of Lille, she bursts out: . . . que l'office de Raison, laquelle il mesmes dit fille de Dieu, doye mectre avant telle parole et par maniere de proverbe comme je ay notée en ycellui chapitre, la ou elle dit a l'Amant que 'en la guerre amoureuse. . .vault mieulx décevoir que deceuz estre'. Et vrayement je oze dire que la Raison maistre Jehan de Meun renia son Pere a cellui mot, car trop donna autre doctrine (Le débat, 14). . . .that the function of Reason, whom he even calls the daughter of God, should be to express by means of a proverb as the one which I noted in that chapter, where she says to the Lover that 'in the amorous war, it is better to deceive than to be deceived.' And truly I dare say that master Jean de Meun's Reason denied her Father in those words, for He taught an entirely different doctrine.21 This tongue-in-cheek reflection on her very own discourse and quoted by Christine, placed at the very beginning of Reason's speech and dovetailing with the tirade of oxymoron as she attempts to define love, sets the tone for what is to come. For the contemporary as well as the modern reader irony, then, is cleverly disguised behind the veil of Reason's expected allegorical role as a personification of rational thought, a daughter of God and, above all, as the founder of language. The confusion created by her contradictory statements on the use of literal and figurative speech leave not only Lover but also the reader puzzled as to the meaning of her words. It is the reoccurring juxtaposition of sexual and textual imagery, in particular her insistence on (pro-)creating and engendering meaning, that makes us suspicious and guides us in our effort to uncover the 'truth'. Reading her discourse as a verbal artifact where the interaction of meanings creates a web of irony, we are made aware that her ambiguous and rather sly persona really does not differ all that much from Lover's subsequent teachers, such as Friend or the Old Woman, nor is its message that far removed from Nature's opinions on the subject, in turn, Lover's rejection of her and the God of Love's insult as to the validity of her advice must be questioned as both instances turn into a sort of cover-up of who Reason is really made out to be.
