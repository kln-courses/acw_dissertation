An imaging study of the mummy labelled 2343 in the Archaeological Museum of Naples has revealed the substitution of an artificial wooden 'prosthesis' for missing feet. The mummy probably dates to the Ptolemaic-early Roman Period, when other examples of prosthetics occur. The imaging study carried out on Egyptian mummies preserved in Italian museums and collections within the framework of the Anubis Project1 has revealed a new and interesting case of restoration * Valentina Giuffra, Gino Fornaciari and Rosalba Ciranni work in the Section of Paleopathology, Division of Surgical, Molecular and Ultrastructural Pathology, Department of Oncology, University of Pisa and Pisa University Hospital, Pisa, Italy.

The mummy, totally unpublished, is stored at the Archaeological Museum of Naples (inventory number 2343) in a not pertinent wooden anthropoid coffin.2 The place of origin and year of its discovery are unknown and, even though it is difficult to assign a date to the mummy, certain details (see below) suggest that the mummy can be dated to the Ptolemaic-early Roman Period. In modern times the bandages have been longitudinally cut from skull to knee, in order to perform a partial external examination. Radiographically the mummy is that of a 35-40 year-old man and is in a very bad state of preservation. The body lies on its back, with the arms crossed on the chest, the right hand on the left shoulder and the left hand on the right one. The skull is completely skeletonized and edentulous; the skin of the thorax and abdomen is partially present and of a pitch-black colour. The skull seems to be empty; the ethmoid bone was broken to permit removal of the brain through the nostrils, according to the traditional procedure of excerebration. A slight arthritis involves the odontoid process and the spinal column shows osteoarthritic changes with compression of the fourth lumbar vertebra. Thoracic and abdominal cavities have been filled with earthy material, and a round-shaped package is visible in the pelvis. A severe bilateral coxarthritis has deformed the femural heads. The fracture of the left acetabulum is certainly the result of post mortem damage. Both menisci are calcified and the left fibula is missing. A remarkable discovery made during the recent imaging was the revelation of an unsuspected, detached hand placed between the femurs (fig. 1). The phalanges, middle phalanges and terminal phalanges seem to be in anatomic connection, but the carpal and metacarpal bones are scattered around. Since the mummy has both its hands, this third hand certainly belongs to another individual and we can only speculate on how it reached this position. Despite the intact appearance of the mummified body below the knees, lateral and anteroposterior X-rays unexpectedly revealed the total absence of both feet. They have been replaced by a single 'prosthesis' in two parts: a rectangular piece of wood resting transversely on the bottom of the coffin and a piece of rather sharply pointed, wedge-shaped wood (figs. 2-3). The two parts were fixed together by three metal nails set at a uniform distance from each other (fig. 3). The presence of a prosthesis on Naples 2343 helps to date the mummy: the practice of 'restoring' mummified bodies, replacing missing limbs with dummies, seems to be typical of the Ptolemaic Period.3 After the excellent results reached by the ancient Egyptian embalmers during the New Kingdom and continuing through the Twenty-first Dynasty, the Twenty-second Dynasty saw the start of a slow decline in the embalming method, which became more marked with time.4 In particular, a greater care is noticeable for the external aspect of the mummies, while the preservation treatments of the corpses themselves are in general neglected. The creation of 'false mummies' is peculiar to the Ptolemaic Period.5 Radiological investigation makes it possible to identify where the anthropomorph wrapping contained a mass of disjointed bones, sometimes belonging to different individuals. Probably in these cases the body of the deceased was destroyed or lost, and the embalmers prepared a false mummy in order to return a corpse to the family for burial.6 In other cases the embalmers used coffins originally created to contain another individual. The limbs were detached and amputated if the body was too big for the coffin; otherwise bones were added if the body was too short to fill the available space.7 More relevant to Naples 2343, it was not infrequent that a corpse reached the embalmers laboratory with some part mutilated, such as the limbs, hands or feet. It was opportune to restore the missing parts with an artificial prosthesis, to give back to the body its original integrity and to permit the deceased to accomplish his journey in the Afterlife with all his attributes. researchers travelled around Italy, visiting the museums where the Egyptian human remains were collected. This material, mostly still unpublished, was properly surveyed and catalogued; X-rays were performed in situ, using a portable X-ray apparatus Minibloc 100/70. See R. Ciranni, D. Pangoli, V.

Mummy 1770 in the Manchester Museum, probably found in Hawara, is that of a fourteen-year-old girl in a poor state of preservation.9 It was at first attributed to the Ptolemaic era, but radiocarbon results demonstrated that while the bandaging could be dated to this period, the body itself appears to be some hundred years older.10 The right leg of the girl was amputated at the distal portion of femur, 10 cm above the knee, while the left leg was amputated at the proximal portion of tibia, 10 cm below the knee. Since there is no trace of reparative activity, it is hypothesized that the legs were amputated at the time of death or later.11 The embalmers probably fabricated the missing parts of the mummy with various materials, to return its integrity to the body, at least externally. The lower part of the left leg was replaced with a piece of wood covered with mud and wrapped in linen. Removal of the bandages around the feet revealed a structure of mud and reeds making up the right foot; an irregular mass of mud substituted for the distal part of the left femur.12 In several cases, the artificial prostheses were made by modelling linen in the form of hands and feet with the aid of resin to confer more resistance to the textiles. A beautiful example is that of a male mummy of unknown origin, now at the Durham Oriental Museum, dated to the Ptolemaic Period and fitted with an artificial arm.13 The left forearm and hand are made entirely of cloth, laid around the remaining bones, modelled to simulate wrist, fingers and thumb, and soaked in resin. The structure appears roughly built up, but not unrealistic, with the fingers partly flexed and the thumb extended. Four other examples were found in Nubia, in cemetery 24 near Dabod, and are all dated to the Ptolemaic Period. The mummy 24:1 :K was that of an old man and displayed a linen dummy in the place of the missing right hand.14 A similar solution is shown in the female mummy 24:1:1, on which both hands were lacking and were replaced with dummies made of linen and resin. In this case the anatomical shape of fingers was only roughly reproduced.15 The mummy 24:1 :L was that of a woman, whose greater part of the right foot and all the bones of both hands were placed in the abdominal cavity, while the radii were inverted, with the lower ends uppermost. The hands and foot were replaced with dummies made entirely of linen.16 In a similar example, the female mummy 24:1 :U had the tarsal, metatarsal and metacarpal bones scattered in the body cavities, and the radii were again inverted. Dummies made of linen and resin substituted for her feet and great care was given to the correct anatomical shape, with the toes made of pieces of reeds. The hands were replaced with dummies made of linen, resin and a few bones.17 On the last two mummies cited, it can be supposed that the extremities had been pulled off and were inserted by the embalmers in the body cavities, making it necessary for them to provide a restoration. The use of wood to fabricate dummy feet is limited to the mummy 2343 in Naples and to the Manchester mummy 1770, while in the other examples hands and feet have been modelled in linen. It can be hypothesized that the embalmers preferred to use cloths soaked in resin instead of wood because it was easier to build up prosthetics and to obtain the desired shape with linen. This explanation seems to be confirmed by the fact that wood, which as well was a more rare and costly material, was employed to make up big and simple anatomical parts, such as a leg and both feet; in contrast, to fabricate single feet and hands, which have a more complicated structure, cloths were consistently preferred. The kind of intervention performed by the ancient embalmers can provide a well-grounded basis to suggest a dating for the mummy. According to the literature consulted, restoration of mutilated 8 The Leiden mummy AMM 14a, belonging to a child of uncertain sex and dated to the end of the Ptolemaic or the Roman Period, cannot longer be cited here as an example of prosthetic use. According to the Gray exami- nation (see P. H. K. Gray, Radiological Aspects of the Mummies of Ancient Egyptians in the Rijksmuseum Van Oudheden, Leiden (Leiden, 1966), mummy n. 24, 25-6, pls. xxi.1-2, xxx. 3) both hands were clearly dummies, but the recent catalogue of the Leiden mummies renders this interpretation invalid, by showing that the mummy in question does not have dummy hands.

Other evidence is provided by the position of the arms, which are crossed over the chest; in the Ptolemaic Period the arms lay generally along the sides of the body with the hands on the thighs, while the crossed position is more often seen in Roman times. In any case, the excerebration and evisceration performed on Naples 2343, as attested by the radiological examination, exclude a dating later than the second century AD, when these practices were abandoned. In conclusion, the mummy could be reasonably dated to the Ptolemaic-early Roman Period. It is impossible to be certain how the feet of Naples 2343 were lost. It can be hypothesized that the body was already mutilated when it reached the embalmers' workshop. In this case the corpse may have been found several days after death, in an advanced state of decomposition. The intervention of necrophagous animals should be excluded, since the distal epiphysis of the tibiae are intact. It seems more likely that the body, lying for an indefinite time without treatment, began to lose its anatomical connection. The distal bones of the feet, the joints of which are known to be weak, were probably the first to be detached, followed by the proximal parts of the feet; the ankle joint is more resistant and requires a longer period to lose its connection.19 Alternatively the loss may have occurred during the mummification process, owing to negligence or scant care on the part of the workers by whom the corpse was treated. At all events, the embalmers promptly found a remedy for the injury, providing the deceased with the necessary integrity for his Afterlife journey.
