<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. Norman Brown THE CREATIVE ROLE OF THE GODDESS VAC IN THE RGVEDA This article is reprinted from Pratidänam: Indian* Iranian .and Indo-European Studies Presented to Franciscus Bernardas Joeobus Kuiper on His Sixtieth Birthday (The Hague: Mouton, 1968, pp. 393-97). An annotated translation of Rgveda 1.164 is in Dr. Brown's article "Agni, Sun, Sacrifice, and Vic: A Sacerdotal . Ode of Dirghatamas {Rgveda 1.164)," JAOS 88.199-219. The translation of Rgveda 10.125 is from Dr. Brown's article "Theories of Creation in the Rgveda," JAOS 85.33. The translation of Rgveda 10.71 is published here for the first time. Among the gods and goddesses of the Rgveda the goddess Vac, deified Holy Speech or Utterance, is so devoid of anthropomorphic qualities as to lack even a minimum of mythology. It might be questioned that she deserves to be called a goddess at all. Macdonell gives her only eleven lines in his Vedic Mythology (p. 124, with an additional remark or two on pp. 87, 137), scanty treatment, which is justified by the fact that her personification is hardly more than one of grammatical gender and remains so until the post-Rgvedic period when she has blended with Sarasvati. In the Rg and Atharva Vedas, broadly speaking, she attains only a fair degree of importance as a bit of hieratic metaphysics, representing the ultimate elevation of the magic power which holy sound is considered to possess. She seems to have received no popular exaltation nor to have had a popular following. Yet within a limited priestly circle, one of those concerned with religious or philosophical speculation, she came to occupy a command- ing position, rivalling the lofty status of such conceptions as the masculines Prajipati, Viávakarman, Purusa, Brhaspati, Brahmanaspati, and the neuters Brahman and Tad Ekam.l The present note aims to bring out this point more positively, as far as I am aware, than has been done before. The Rgvedic sources for this view of_Vlc are the three hymns 10.71, 10.125, and 1.164, the last ascribed to Dirghatamas. Of these the most informative is 1.164, though the information it contains about Vic has not had the attention from scholars which they have given to the others and which it deserves, perhaps because the puzzlesome character of that hymn as a whole may have veiled from them the light it casts upon her role. This fact has been impressed upon me in the course of an intensive study which I have been making of that hymn. Deussen, for example, in his translation and interpretation of RV 1.164 seems not to have recognized that it is Vac who is the One Real (êkãm sât) of stanza 46. 2 As the Holy Utterance of the Vedic ritual, Vic, in the eyes of her cult, was the final apotheosis of the power of spells, charms, incantations. Macdonell points out (loo. ait.) that in the Naighantuka (5.5) she "is enumerated among the deities of the atmosphere; and* thunder, or mãdhyamikã vãc, 'the voice of the middle region', in the terminology of the commentators (Nir. 11.27), may have been the starting point of the personification."</page><page sequence="2">- 20 - This would be plausible enough, though the number of passages in the Rgveda where Vac seems certainly to refer to thunder is not great. The identification would fit in the Indra/Vrtra myth, the scene of which is the atmosphere; for, if the lightning is Indra's weapon {vajra) , the sound that accompanies the lightning might also be regarded as having a magic potency. But if the thunder is actually the origin of Vac's personification, Dirghatamas gives no sign of accepting that view. For him Vic does not reside in the atmosphere e Her place is at the peak of the universe: "On the top of yonder sky, they say, is Vac, who knows a^l but does not enter all11 (manträyante divo amüsya prsthê víévavídam vacam âviêvaminvãm , RV 1.164. 10). 3 This would be in the* upper half of* heaven, which is separated from the lower half by the vault (nãka; see Macdonell, op. cit., p. 8fe), which the Sun does not enter, for it is restricted to the "lower" part (ûpare . . . ârpitam, RV 1.164.12), possibly because it is mortal, dying every evening, and only the immortal attain to Vac's abode, as RV 1.164· 45 makes clear: "Vãc was divided in four parts. These those Brahmans with insight (and hence immortality; see RV 1.164.22-25) know. Three parts, which are hidden, mortals do^not activate; the^fourth part they speak" ^{oatvãri vuk pârimita padãni tãni vidur brãhmanã yê manïsinah / aúhã trtni nihita nêngayanti turtyam vãoõ manusyã vadanti, RV 1.164.45).^ Vac is presented by Dirghatamas as the supreme authority in the universe. She is the mistress of the aksara of the ro9 "the (creative) syllable, on which the gods in highest heaven have ail taken their seat - what will he who does not know it accomplish by means of the rcVy {roô aksâre jparamé vyòman yâsmin devü àdhi viêve nisedüh / y ás tán nâ veda kim rcã karisyati yâ it tad vidûs tá imê sâm ãsate' RV 1.164.39). Dirghatamas offers no explanation of her origin, but he calls her the "One Real" {êkam sât) in 1.164.46 and it is apparently she whom in an earlier stanza (1.164.6), again using the neuter gender, he calls simply "the One" (êkam) . She is self-existent, the Absolute, dependent upon nothing outside_herself , as is also the neuter "That One" {tâd êkam) of RV 10.129.2,3. Dirghatamas also gives no description of Vic's qualities, nor does he tell us wherein lies her metaphysical power. Dirghatamas tells us that Vac, whom he speaks of as a buffalo cow, lowed ^and thus fashioned the tumultuous chaotic floods {gauriv mirriàya salilani tâkqatî, RV 1.164.41), a statement standing in contrast to that of RV 10.129.3 concerning the beginning of things, where the text tells us "that the unillumined flood (sing.) of chaos existed at the beginning and That One breathed (came into existence) by its own potentiality {agre 'praketâm salilâm . β . tán mahinajayataikam) . After Vac had fashioned the floods, the (heavenly) «oceans flowed forth from her, in consequence of which the four directions exist, and then the aksára flowed ^forth; on it this entire universe has its existence {tâsyãh samudrã âdhi vi ksaranti têna jZvanti pradiêaê câtasrah / tâtah ksaraty aksâram tâd viêvam ûpa jivati RV 1.164.42). Thus by the sounds she uttered Vãc produced the material of the universe, which was, however, chaotic, unorganized, when it was produced. But, Dirghatamas avers, she had also produced the aksâra, the instrument with which the unorganized material was to be organized. To make use of the aksâra and with it perform the first sacrifice, which was that of creation, the "heroes" {virâh) took over (RV 1.164.43). Who the "heroes" were and what their origin Dirghatamas does not state. On the basis of RV 10.72, which is</page><page sequence="3">- 21 - another hymn describing creation, it might be thought that they were the seven Adityas, who are there cast in that role. Or the "heroes" may be the "three long-haired ones" (trãyah keêínah) in the stanza (44) just following that in which the "heroes" are mentioned. These three "long- haired ones" also are not clearly identified» though a fair guess is that they are Agni, Surya, and Vayu, acting respectively as the fire priest, ^ the supervising priest, and the manipulating priest at the first sacrifice. It seems that the first sacrificers needed Agni to teach them the ritual so that they could function. It is possible, but not certain, that in RV 1.164.4 Dirghatamas recognizes Agni as the "Structured One" (masc.) whom the "Unstructured One" (literally "boneless" one) bore (ko dadarsa prathamân jayamãnam asthanvãntam yád anasthã bíbhartí / bhïïmya ásur ãsrg ãtmâ kvá svit kô vidvãmsam úpa gãt prástum etat) . The Unstructured One (fern.) is clearly identified in the second half of the stanza as the Earth. In the stanza (1.164.5) immediately following the one just quoted there is a reference to the first sacrifice, with a statement that the kavis performing the sacrifice spread out seven threads over the calf, which must be the Structured One of the preceding stanza. Agni, we may assume, had been instructed in the aksára and its use by Vãco_ She had_uttered it in its full sequence (ékapaãí dvipãdi sä cátuspadi astapadi navapadi babhuvúsi9 RV 1.164.41 be), apparently teaching it to Agni, who is named as "the firstborn of the rta" (prathamajã rtãsya 1.164.37; cf. agnih . . . prathamajã rtãsya, RV 10.5.7). He communicates it to priests today, as is indicated in 1*164.21,7 and may be assumed to have communicated it to the first sacrificers when they laid down the precedents, literally "footprints" (padäni) , for future sacrificers (1.164.5); these sacrificers were the kavis mentioned above who spread out the seven threads over the newborn Structured One. At this first sacrifice the Sun was produced (RV 1.164.5-10) and by means of a repetition of that sacrifice it is now caused to rise each morning (1.164.26-30) so that it can continue to support the universe. Thus the chain of creation is complete. Vac produced the raw material of the universe, the means for organizing it, and taught Agni, who taught the gods, how to use that means. The capstone of the process was the provision that the instruction should be imparted to men so that they could constantly renew creation and thus perpetuate the existence of the universe. The hymns RV 10.71 and 10.125 do not offer materials for a consecutive account of Vac in the role of creator. At best they only remark upon certain features of it. The stanzas RV 10.125.7-8 give us the most information: "On the brow of this universe I give birth to the Father. My birthplace (home) is in the Waters in the (heavenly) ocean. Thence I spread out over the worlds on all sides. I touch yonder sky with the crown of my head (7). I breathe like the wind supporting all the worlds. Beyond the sky, beyond this earth so great have I become by my might. (8) "^</page><page sequence="4">- 22 - These stanzas agree with RV 1.164 in that they place Vac's abode at the top of the universe (1.164.10) and have her encompassing the worlds on all sides (1.164.45; cf. Purusa in RV 10.90.3). They add to the account of 1.164 in specifying that Vic gives birth to the Father (Dyaus?) , and herself supports the worlds as does the Wind; in 1.164.13,14 it is the Sun which supports the worlds. RV 10.125.1-3 states that Vac travels with (supports?) the Rudras and the Vasus, the Adityas and the Viáve Devãh, and supports Varuna and Mitra, Indra, Agni, and the Aávins, Soma, Tvastr, Pusan, and Bhaga, and that the gods have distributed her manifoldly* and call her the first of those to be worshipped, who dwells in many homes. These assertions recall the division of Vac in four parts by the first sacrificers, so that she is known to mortals as Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, Garutmant, Agni, Yama, Mãtariávan {RV 1.164.45,46), while the statement that she dwells in many places corresponds in some degree to the statement of RV 1.164.10 that Vic knows all but does not enter all (viêvavídam vacam ãvisvaminvãm) . RV 10.71 says very little about Vic's creative role; rather it seems in its first words to assign primacy to Brhaspati, whom it addresses (cf. RV 10.72.2, where primacy is given to Brahmanaspati) , and implies, but does not say so explicitly, that Vãc is secondary to him. For those who like Dirghatamas considered Vac the creator and the supreme power in the universe it was entirely consistent to think of the highest knowledge as being knowledge of her and understanding her utterances. This was to be knowledge not only of the one part which mortals speak but also of the other three parts which mortals do not employ (nengayanti, 1.164.45). Those who acquire this complete knowledge know the ritual in all its minutiae and in its full application; they also know the full metaphysical significance of the separate parts of the ritual. Such a priest, who is rare, is differentiated from ordinary priests, who may know the parts of the ritual and their sequence well enough but have never penetrated to its true transcendental quality and do not understand the full coordination of the separate functions of the different technical priests who officiate at the sacrifice. RV 10.71 elaborates this point and discriminates between those priests who look but do not really see and listen but do not really hear and that priest who really sees, really hears (stanzas 4, 7). The latter kind wins in the sacrificial contest and brings glory and rewards to the priestly college of which he is a member (10.71.10). RV 10.125.4,5 expresses the same view in very similar terms; such a one, who really sees and really hears, has her favor. »Priests of this sort justifiably "laud their portion of immortality11 (amftasya bhãgâm . . . ábhisvâranti , 1.164.21). The verb paë/spaê is often used to indicate this kind of seeing; it might be translated "have a transcendental vision11· Three times in RV 1.164 (stanzas 1, 31, 43) Dirghatamas uses it of his experience (apaéyam) . What he saw was the first sacrifice and all the occurrences that preceded it. In another place (stanza 4) he asks significantly "Who has seen?" (kô dadarêá) . Seeing or finding out or learning metaphysical truth by inquiry is not uncommon in the Rgveda, for example in 1.163.6; 10.72.1; 10.81.4; 10.124.9; 10.129.4; 10.130*6. But how does a seeker win such a vision, gain such transcendental knowledge? It does not come to him easily; it comes only through intense mental application, concentration. A common expression for the method to</page><page sequence="5">- 23 - be employed is mdnasa or manZsã; this may be viewed as a technical term and it is used thus in RV 1.163.6; 1.164.5; 10.71.2; 10.81.4; 10.124.9; 10.129.4; 10.130.6, and possibly in other passages - I have not made an exhaustive search. A person possessed of knowledge gained in this way is manlsin (1.164.45) or vipra (1.164.6) or kavlydmãna (1.164.18). With such effort one may have this surpassing vision. Then only does Vãc grant him her favor, "make him powerful, a true knower of the mystical power, a seer, a successful sacrificer" A® Then only does she reveal herself to him like a well-arrayed eager bride to her husband. H He has become one of the happy few, successful in the fullest and the highest sense, an immortal destined to share the loftiest heaven with Vic.</page><page sequence="6">- 24 - NOTES 1.

Norman Brown TO THE GODDESS VAC (Rgveda 10.71) 1. O Brhaspati, the first beginning of Vac was when they (the Wise) appeared, engaged in bestowing names, when what was their best, what was perfect, which had been kept in secret, was revealed from their love (of mankind) · [Utterance of a name caused the creature named to come into existence.] 2. Where the Wise, as if cleansing grain with a sieve, with mental application produced Vac, there the colleagues recognized the usages of collaboration; their auspicious symbol lay in Vac. 3. With the sacrifice they followed Vac's track; they found her entered in the rsis. They brought her out and divided her manifoldly. Seven singers join in praising her. 4« One (priest) looks but does not see Vac; one listens but does not hear Vac. To another she discloses herself like a richly arrayed, passionate wife to her husband. 5. One colleague they (the fellowship of priests) speak of as fixedly reserved; they do not urge him to take part in the sacrificial contests. He operates with an unproductive (literally, milkless) delusion; he has listened to a Vac that is fruitless and flowerless. 6. He who fails a faithful colleague has no part in Vac. When he listens to her, he listens in vain; for not at all does he know the way of the successful Act (sacrifice) . 7. Though colleagues all have eyes and ears, they are unequal in mental capacity. Some are like pools that reach to the mouth or armpits; others are like pools fit for bathing. 8. Where priestly colleagues together perform a sacrifice with the product of their mental quickness shaped by the heart (that is, fashioned with their utmost skill), there indeed they intentionally leave one behind; the others go away as Brahmans of renown. 9. Those who (at the sacrifice) move neither to this side nor to that (that is, lazily stay still), acting neither as priests nor as preparers of soma, and insincerely sidling up to Vãc, they weave a web of siris, the ignoramuses. [The word siris occurs no where else in the language and its meaning is unknown.] 10. All colleagues rejoice in a colleague who returns in glory, victorious in the assembly; for he saves them from shame, wins subsistence for them, and remains prepared for contest. 11. One (priest, the invoker) is engaged in bringing to flower the wealth of the sacred stanzas; another (the chanter) sings the chants in the éakvarî meter; another, the Brahman (the supervisory priest) speaks</page><page sequence="9">- 27 - innate wisdom; another (the manipulating priest) measures the (totality of) measure of the sacrifice.
