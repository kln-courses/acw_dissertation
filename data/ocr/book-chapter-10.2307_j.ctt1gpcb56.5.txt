<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 1: Landscaping nature’s otherness   in Pre-1960s Terraforming   and Proto-gaian Stories Landscaping nature’s otherness The 1960s saw the consolidation of a growing awareness of environ- mentalism. rachel Carson’s 1962 Silent Spring popularised the american  environmental movement, while James Lovelock first conceived the basis  for the gaia hypothesis in 1965. Their writings influenced the developing  environmental movement, if not always in ways that Lovelock approved  of, yet prior to the 1960s sf had engaged with ideas that anticipated  and fed into modern environmental philosophy and what Lovelock now  refers to as gaia theory. anna Bramwell traces the growth of ecological  awareness from its origins in the 1880s and notes how the scientific  romances of writers such as H.g. Wells incorporated ecologically inflected  concepts into their narrative explorations of the relationship between  nature and politics. Bramwell differentiates between ecologism, which  is concerned with global social and economic change, and environmen- talism, which diverged from ecologism in the 1930s to focus on specific  problem-solving at localised political levels (1990, 104–05). Terraforming stories explore the otherness of nature, a view that  opposes the interconnectedness without boundaries that deep ecology  endorses. Links have been forged between holist approaches to the  physical sciences raised by the gaia hypothesis and the deep ecology  movement. Val Plumwood explains that ‘dominant forms of deep ecology  choose for their core concept of analysis the notion of identification,  understood as an individual psychic act rather than a political practice’  (1993, 17). in its weaker formulation, recognition of nature’s otherness  can be considered a form of deep ecology when it is understood simply  as an attention to ‘the interconnectedness of the natural world (as  in some sense the bearer of non-instrumental value) and humanity’s  place within it, so as to effect fundamental social change that will  bring humanity to its proper place’ (Hailwood, 2004, 36). Deep  ecology’s strong identification with nature, however, raises problems  for recognising nature’s otherness. Citing Bill Devall and george  18 </page> <page sequence="2"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 19 Sessions’s claim that ‘“to the extent that we perceive boundaries, we  fall short of deep ecological consciousness”’ (121), Hailwood argues that  stronger forms of holism often associated with the gaia hypothesis are  incompatible with the recognition of difference involved in conceptions  of nature’s otherness (36). This chapter examines terraforming themes during the interwar  period in the work of two influential writers of scientific romance,  H.g. Wells and olaf Stapledon, and in British pulp writer John russell  fearn’s short story ‘earth’s mausoleum.’ The second part examines the  use of the living world motif in scientific romances by m.P. Shiel and  Sir arthur Conan Doyle, and in a cluster of american pulp stories by  edmond Hamilton, Jack Williamson and Laurence manning, three  significant shapers of the 1930s space opera. This discussion concludes  by moving beyond the interwar period to consider how the themes  connected to the living world motif were taken up during the postwar  period by murray Leinster. These works use the terraforming and living  world motifs to explore orientations to nature’s otherness, anticipating  ideas later incorporated into the gaia hypothesis. Terraforming as a Site for Environmental  Philosophical Reflection many thinkers have used terraforming as an experimental site for the  exploration of science and philosophy. This approach trades on the  notion that sf is a literature of ideas, offering textual spaces for thought  experiments in the tradition of the conte philosophique. erin moore Daly  and robert frodeman argue that space exploration and environmental  ethics were generated from a closely related set of socio-economic and  historical factors and that ‘before the launching of Sputnik in 1957,  philosophic consideration of space was lodged within the science fiction  literature of H.g. Wells, Jules Verne, ray Bradbury, arthur C. Clarke,  and others’ (2008, 137). Daly and frodeman outline the various ethical  positions on the terraformation of both lifeless planets and planets  that support microbial life. They show how this debate tends to orbit  around notions of intrinsic value, the worth an object has by virtue of  its inherent properties. Both David grinspoon and Christopher P. mcKay support the  introduction of life to otherwise uninhabited planets, while robert  Zubrin takes a stronger position by supporting the introduction of life to  planets already inhabited by microbial life. Holmes rolston iii contests  this view and argues that the habitation of lifeless planets should be  </page> <page sequence="3"> 20 Terraforming avoided, while another preservationist, alan marshall, strictly opposes  any sort of interference whatsoever. martyn fogg counters this view by  pointing out that such arguments ‘are often misanthropic critiques of  human nature’ or ‘sentimental illusions based on out-of-date ecology’; he  argues that abiotic nature cannot have intrinsic value because it cannot  think, act, or care (Daly and frodeman, 2008, 146–47, 147). While  robert Sparrow notes the ‘shocking moral bankruptcy’ that terraforming  scenarios highlight, his arguments do not preclude the possibility of  terraforming, but rather ‘suggest that we examine ourselves and how the  project reflects on our character before we undertake it’ (1999, 239). He  explains that ‘[i]f for instance, terraforming were a project undertaken  with genuine reluctance, in full knowledge of what was being destroyed,  because no alternative existed for the survival of the human race,’ such  projects would not demonstrate hubris or aesthetic insensitivity and  would therefore be a legitimate, if regrettable, action (240). Daly and frodeman point out that while abiotic nature may not  have intrinsic value, ‘the relatedness of nature and natural objects to  human beings’ may be grounds for a relational, extrinsic value: ‘[w] e may be confident that rocks do not think, or have values of their  own. But humans can nonetheless value rocks for their own sake –  they can be experienced as beautiful, sublime, or sacred’ (2008, 147,  emphasis in the original). These aesthetic categories include important  responses to abiotic nature and have traditionally provided an arena for  environmental philosophical debate for thinkers such as allen Carlson  (1979; 1981; 2002), Stan godlovitch, Yuriko Saito (1998), Thomas Heyd  and Patricia m. matthews (2001). nevertheless, there are grounds for  arguing that Simon Hailwood’s concept of nature’s otherness provides  for such an extrinsic, relational value to be accorded to both biotic and  abiotic nature without relying on appeals to aesthetic value. Hailwood  argues that nature, albeit a social construction, also possesses an aspect  that cannot be reduced to the social sphere, what he calls ‘nature’s  otherness.’ although Hailwood notes that nature is present ‘“from the  streetcorner to the stratosphere”’ and that nature’s otherness is therefore  a property of familiar, unfamiliar and alien examples of nature (2004,  35), godlovitch summarises the essence of the strong form of the  relationship between humankind and nature when he contends that  ‘nature is, for us, fundamentally inaccessible and alien’ (1994, 19).  Sf’s investment in radical, alien otherness makes this notion useful for  critical consideration of specific works from environmental philosophical  perspectives. Through the deployment of iconic sf others, such as the  robot, the alien and the adapted human, sf has engaged with the politics  and philosophy of otherness from multiple theoretical positions. in  </page> <page sequence="4"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 21 contrast to human-centred critiques such as marxism, feminism, and  postcolonialism, ecocritical perspectives interrogate anthropomorphism  and can be seen as anti-humanist in mcKay’s sense of the term: ‘[h] umans have no special rights or needs and do not determine the value  of the environment’ (1990, 188). nevertheless, there are significant  intersections between these positions, and in much sf they often work  in mutually supportive ways. Keekok Lee uses the example of terraforming to examine nature’s  value when nature is understood to encompass other parts of the solar  system. She notes that many environmental ethicists find it ‘deeply  problematic to argue that abiotic nature could have intrinsic value’,  because this is a property more often accorded to biotic life (1994,  90). addressing mcKay’s observation that environmental axioms tend  towards a narrowly earthbound environmental ethics, Lee uses the  example of terraforming because ‘an environmental ethics informed by  features unique to earth may be misleading and prove inadequate as  technology increasingly threatens to invade and colonize other planets in  the solar system’ (89). She begins her thought experiment by proposing  that ‘mars has no organic life and, therefore, it follows, no intrinsic  value’ (91). Developing this line of thought, Lee considers that it may  be morally permissible to produce biotic life in places where it has  undergone degradation; from here it is a short but unwarranted leap  to the rhetorical question, ‘if such permission [for nature’s restoration]  obtains on earth, why not mars?’ (91). Lee explores the necessity for an  environmental ethics that ‘confront[s] the issue of abiotic or inanimate  nature as a locus of intrinsic value’ (92). The War on Nature in Wells’s The Shape of Things to Come and  John Russell Fearn’s ‘Earth’s Mausoleum’ The interwar period hosted a debate between two strands of ecologism.  The first is a monism that can be traced back to ernst Haeckel, who  coined ecology in 1866, and his student Hans Dreisch, who popularised  ecological vitalism in germany and in a series of lectures in Scottish  and english universities until 1913. The other strand derives from energy  economics, which is based on the recognition of entropic processes and  the finiteness of earth’s resources, ideas often understood as implying a  mechanistic view of nature. Bramwell argues that Wells and Stapledon  drew from the energy economics prevalent during the interwar period  and cites Wells as an example of the scientific utopians who preferred  strategies of global planning conducted by a scientific elite (1990, 54, 65).  Wells was a member of the fabian Society, an organisation that shared  </page> <page sequence="5"> 22 Terraforming with the monist League (which inspired Haeckel’s ecological vitalism)  Wells’s trust in the utopianism of a cadre of scientists who could bypass  the contemporary political process. in Vibrant Matter, Jane Bennett considers the philosophical history  of vitalism and sketches a framework for a contemporary vibrant  materiality that possesses a distributive agency. By ‘vitality,’ Bennett  refers to ‘the capacity of things – edibles, commodities, storms, metals  – not only to impede or block the will and designs of humans but  also to act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories, propensities, or  tendencies of their own’ (2010, viii). it is important to consider the  vibrant materiality of things because ‘the image of dead or thoroughly  instrumentalized matter feeds human hubris and our earth-destroying  fantasies of conquest and consumption’ (ix). While Bennett focuses her  analysis on non-living matter, on things that, she argues, possesses an  ‘active, earthy, not-quite-human capaciousness’ (3), she invokes Vladimir  ivanovich Vernadsky’s early formulation of the notion of the biosphere  and his emphasis on the continuity of biotic and abiotic matter (8).  She writes that ‘in the long and slow time of evolution, then, mineral  material appears as the mover and shaker, the active power, and the  human beings, with their much-lauded capacity for self-directed action,  appear as its product’ (11). Wells’s The Shape of Things to Come (1967 [1933]) is a future history  that recounts an episode of ‘geogonic planning’ during the world state’s  technocratic management of earth. This example of terraforming is  a form of geoengineering embarked upon after a long period of war  and global unification leads to a scientific utopia. Wells sent a copy  of this work to his correspondent and admirer olaf Stapledon, whose  Last and First Men (1966 [1930]) and Star Maker (2004 [1937]) utilise  the future history within a cosmic schema as part of their design  as ‘essay[s] in myth creation’ (Stapledon, 1966, 12). Brian Stableford  explains that Stapledon’s works ‘construct imaginary worlds to embody  metaphysical theses’ (1985, 138). Stapledon incorporated into Last and  First Men elements of J.B.S. Haldane’s ‘The Last Judgement’ (1927),  which proposes the terraformation of Venus, combining this with  J.W. Dunne’s speculations on alternative temporalities and prescient  dreaming in An Experiment With Time (1981). Unlike Wells’s work,  which showed a reliance on energy economics, Stapledon’s works are  indebted to vitalist philosophies that emphasised notions of a life-force  underpinning conceptions of nature. The Shape of Things to Come features episodes of geoengineering  representing the culmination of civilisation’s effort to address a  deep-rooted anxiety towards nature. This anxiety underlies a complex of  </page> <page sequence="6"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 23 environmental relations and effects that appear in earlier phases of civili- sation’s development, such as the colonial appropriation of resources,  international war and the dramatic reduction of species diversity and  species’ environments. at a late stage of the world state’s growth, earth  is described in a way that justifies the physical mastery of the planet  and confirms the socio-political system supporting the state: ‘[f]rom the  air on a map it was manifest that the world was still “governed.” The  road system was like a net cast over a dangerous beast’ (Wells, 1967,  442). The endeavour to govern nature by ensnaring it in a planetary  road system is symptomatic of humanity’s fundamental dependence on  a hostile environment. Such dependence is portrayed in the chapter ‘1933: Progress Comes  to a Halt,’ where the narrator highlights a representative instance of ‘a  terrific defeat for [a town near Cardiff] in the war upon nature’ (Wells,  1967, 132). This event, in which a local mine explodes and kills three  hundred people, stands as a microcosm for humanity’s dependence  on and subjugation to natural forces. The text’s fictionalisation of the  difficulty of recovering economic and social wellbeing in the wake of the  great War of 1914–1918 enlarges the scope of humanity’s vulnerability  to nature. These local and international events exemplify civilisation’s  physical fragility. The threat symbolised by the emblem of earth as a  dangerous beast signifies an uneven human relationship to nature. as a  consequence of humanity’s ‘war against nature,’ civilisation’s changing  technological abilities allow it to mitigate this dependence on and vulner- ability to its environment. The emblem of the ensnaring road system is a landscape that  symbolises progress. The world state’s political unification and techno- logical proficiency is seen as the solution to humanity’s difficult  adaptation to nature. roads overcome spatial constraints and unify  disparate nations by facilitating travel and communication over long  distances. Contrasting the old order to the saner technological utopia of  the ‘modern World State’, the narrator identifies a disparity between two  forces as the underlying reason for the former’s failure to overcome both  nature and civilisation’s fragility: ‘[t]he great processes of mechanical  invention, which have been described in our general account of the  release of experimental science from deductive intellectualism, were  increasing the power and range of every operating material force  quite irrespective of its fitness or unfitness for the new occasions of  mankind’ (Wells, 1967, 48–49). Deductive intellectualism is essential to  direct the use of new technologies in accordance with the needs of the  time, lest unchecked use of power steer civilisation to war and socio- political collapse. During the ascendancy of the modern World State the  </page> <page sequence="7"> 24 Terraforming dialectic between humanity and its environment is subject to civilisa- tion’s increasing influence, allowing humanity to overcome the failures  of the old socio-political order. The application of technologies capable  of altering the planet’s environments offers opportunities for directed  human evolution; the narrator speculates that ‘an increase in desirable  habitats may bring with it an increase in the variety of desirable human  types’ (Wells, 1967, 455). The dialectic underlying civilisation turns  on evolution, which governs the relationship between the human and  the non-human and which is in turn connected to ideas of progress,  ‘the essential and permanent conflict in life between the past and the  future, between the accomplished past and the forward effort’ (54). The  developing world state embodies this conflict as it attempts to redress  the imbalances between technological capability and its fit use wrought  by the excesses of the old order. The Transport Control fails to effectively maintain global unity,  eventually ceding to an enlightened scientific community capable of  better managing earth’s resources. This saner, more reflective humanity  is able to resolve many environmental and geopolitical problems.  recapitulating economist Henry george’s metaphor in Progress and Poverty  (1920 [1879]) of the earth as a well-provisioned ship sailing through  space, the narrator explains that this new government establishes a way  of living that shows how ‘[t]his planet, which seemed so stern a mother  to mankind, [was] discovered to be inexhaustible in its bounty. and the  greatest discovery man has made has been the discovery of himself’  (Wells, 1967, 487). This vision of nature remains instrumental, as it is  considered both a resource and an object for autological speculation,  which reflects concern onto the study of the human self. The socio-political sphere is mapped against nature through its  structuring as a metaphorical ‘ecology’ (Wells, 1967, 290). as humanity  is better able to manipulate the planet, ‘[h]istory becomes a record of  increasingly vast engineering undertakings and cultivations, of the  pursuit of minerals and of the first deep borings into the planet. new  mechanisms appeared, multiplied, and were swept away by better  mechanisms. The face of the earth changed’ (Wells, 1967, 413). Despite  these changes and the early exploration and mapping of ‘the last terra  incognitae,’ earth for the Second Council was ‘a world of promise still  to be fulfilled’ (Wells, 1967, 51, 445). an early anticipation of geoengi- neering appears in the brief chapter ‘geogonic Planning,’ where the  ‘[m]odification of the planet-levels operating in conjunction with the  restoration of forests now in progress’ is considered (454). Here, the world  state’s plans for planetary engineering remain a dream of ‘moulding a  fire-sprouting, quivering planet closer to the expanding needs of man’  </page> <page sequence="8"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 25 (455). geogonic planning represents a stage in the development of civili- sation in which ‘deductive intellectualism’ directs the use of technology,  thus allowing humanity to alter nature to provide ideal foundations for  a scientific utopia whose expansion is charged with colonial ideology. in  either case the form of progress that is advanced here, evident from the  landscaping analysed by the narrator, is a response to an asymmetric  relationship between humanity and non-human nature that disrespects  nature’s autonomy. nature in this context is earthbound and non-human.  Human relationships to nature tend towards instrumentalism, with nature  functioning as a resource for and background to civilisation. Human  dependence on this beastlike non-human nature exacerbates the dangers  that nature poses to civilisation, imagined as a sharply demarcated entity.  This understanding of nature attempts in part to account for the failure  of ‘The age of frustration’ to realise its project of progress. The Shape of Things to Come was adapted in 1936 into the well-received  film Things to Come, which popularised the broad themes of Wells’s future  history. it portrayed the decline of civilisation after war and the struggle  from ‘barbaric’ nation states to a scientific world civilisation riddled by  widespread disaffection with the dominant ideology of progress. This  film stages a debate over the worth of science for society, and it retains  a sense of the asymmetry between humankind and nature. The rise of  the scientific age is preceded by a period of rebuilding described as ‘an  active and aggressive peace’ where all of earth’s resources are tapped to  ‘put the world in order’ (menzies, 1936). Theotocopulos, the leader of a  rebellion against continuing progress in the year 2036, concedes that this  age of ‘machines and marvels’ has conquered nature and built ‘a great  white world’ of artificially lighted underground cities, thus replacing  nature’s threatening otherness with a construct rigidly controlled by  technology (menzies, 1936). The conflict in this future age centres on a  rebellion against progress that is expressed as a desire for the destruction  of a ‘space gun,’ the world civilisation’s first attempt at interplanetary  travel and a symbol of continuing scientific progress (menzies, 1936).  Theotocopulos’s arguments centre precisely on the Promethean fear that  cosmological nature engenders: anticipating further journeys into space  that the success of the space gun portends, Theotocopulos foretells in  a public speech that ‘the time will come when you in your turn will  be forced away to take their chance on strange planets, on dreary,  abominable places beyond the stars’ (menzies, 1936). This ideological opposition centres on the idea of the colonisation  and shaping of other worlds in the future, a possibility that is ultimately  endorsed by the film’s climax. Contesting notions of progress with ideas  of freedom, rest and safety, Theotocopulos argues that the sacrifice of  </page> <page sequence="9"> 26 Terraforming human lives to technological and scientific progress will eventually alter  the face of the whole world once again, thus forcing the majority who  are content with current circumstances to adapt to new conditions.  These primarily social concerns are symbolically invested in a confron- tation with untamed nature. The conquerors of the old world order,  who directed their mastery towards other societies, are replaced by a  government that attempts to dominate first local and then increasing  scales of nature, before this tendency culminates in an expansion  outward towards space. oswald Cabal, the grandson of the legendary  John Cabal, who inaugurated the scientific age, argues that any life  worth living must continue to advance, and that this advance can only  be achieved by facing death, symbolised by space. only by striving for a  continual expansion outward to the stars and thus confronting human  limits can living be made worthwhile. Lee’s asymmetry Thesis claims that while humans are dependent on  nature, nature is not similarly dependent on humanity: ‘[n]ature’s own  existence and functioning integrity is independent of human existence’  (Lee, 1994, 93). The autonomy Thesis builds on this by stating that ‘the  earth and its extremely complex biosphere are fully autonomous’ (93).  Lee uses the example of human extinction to point out that nature  would continue to operate in the absence of humanity. She defines  autonomy here as nature’s ‘ability to exist, to function integratively and  well without any reference to, assistance from or reliance on humans’  (93). The Shape of Things to Come and Things to Come recognise the  asymmetry Thesis by demonstrating humanity’s dependence on earth  while reflecting on earth’s independent existence, although they do  illustrate nature’s physical fragility through its devastation by war and  humanity’s adaptation of its surface. They also show a disrespect of the  autonomy Thesis and nature’s otherness in that earthbound nature is  only valuable instrumentally: as a condition for ensuring human comfort  and as a space where humanity can, narcissistically, reflect on its own  mind. While this is not in itself problematic, these works take the extra  step of disregarding the way these human landscapes fail to recognise  nature’s autonomy and otherness, thus contributing to an attitude  that leads to its domination. The emblem of earth as an imprisoned  beast and the theme of civilisation’s war against nature are reactions  against this asymmetry and responses that curtail nature’s autonomy.  Hailwood suggests that nature’s otherness can be usefully predicated  on the autonomy and no-Teleology Theses (the latter discussed below),  but that the additional asymmetry Thesis could lead to a Promethean  fear that would justify the domination of nature in order to counter its  threatening aspect (2004, 31). This dynamic is amply demonstrated by  </page> <page sequence="10"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 27 the notion of progress and its entailments depicted in The Shape of Things  to Come and its cinematic counterpart. John russell fearn’s ‘earth’s mausoleum’ (1935) is conspicuous as one  of few stories published in the 1930s that centres on planetary adaptation,  and many of its themes became staples of the terraforming narrative.  in this story, the original impactor that separated the moon from earth  re-emerges and is revealed to be an alien spacecraft. its occupants  are scientists who freely share their technology and expertise with  humanity to organise and transform the earth. They represent the ideal  combination of deductive intellectualism in their capacity for scientific  world management and experimental science in their superlative techno- logical achievements. Crespin, a scientist and the appointed successor to  the alien leader mayro, sees terraforming as an extension of geoengi- neering, an act of conquest to ‘extend earth’s ramifications’ (fearn, 1935,  72). mayro directs a ‘one-Year Plan’ to open up earth’s environments  and resources for human use, ‘the vast improvement in the constructional  scheme of the world’ (71). once their war on nature tames the earth,  the aliens turn their attention to the grand project of terraforming the  moon to ‘cultivate a perfect little world’ (75). Terraforming involves the  construction of massive atmosphere generators and much human labour,  leading one scientist to think that they are dealing in things too big for  them, ‘beating nature at her own game, so to speak’ (75). as the iconic  image of a ‘softly green “new” earth visible from the sky’ of humankind’s  first planet takes shape, the second phase of terraforming begins as the  tough community of pioneers level mountain ranges and crater walls to  shape the moon’s topology (75). mayro’s discovery of a method for liberating atomic force and the  invention of a powerful ‘dredger’ triggers growing social unrest as the  once happily busy colonists are deprived of fulfilment in hard work.  Capitalising on this disaffection, saboteurs disrupt the dredger but,  because they fail to appreciate how it operates, accidentally initiate a  process that siphons energy from the Sun. To avert disaster, dreams of  a utopian new earth are abandoned when the moon is converted into a  new sun. mayro and the surviving aliens, well-meaning scientists who  underestimate the impact of introducing new technology and social  arrangements to human society, sacrifice themselves and their ship so  as to ensure that humankind survives the catastrophe. Like the scientific  utopians of Things to Come, they fail to appreciate society’s resistance to  rapid and sweeping technological change. Terraforming, an endeavour  that represents the best that science and technology have to offer,  promises fulfilment and power to humankind only if human nature can  accept the social changes it brings. ‘earth’s mausoleum’ endorses the  </page> <page sequence="11"> 28 Terraforming control that science and technology offers at the expense of respecting  nature’s autonomy, but it assigns the failure to respect nature’s fragility  to the saboteurs: their casual manipulation of technologies they do not  understand shows a failure to acknowledge human dependency on both  nature and technology. Nature’s Otherness and Terraforming in Stapledon’s Last and  First Men and Star Maker Wells and fearn depict human relationships to nature in terms of a  universalising progress that remained widespread in sf, especially in  terraforming and gaian narratives. Stanislaw Lem would later attack this  theme in Solaris, parodying it as ‘the long historic march of humanity’  (2003 [1961], 167). The war on nature theme appears in Stapledon’s  Last and First Men (1966), in which the eighth men’s terraforming  of neptune is described as ‘the story of man’s attack upon his final  home’ (271). This attack, following the earlier terraforming of Venus,  grows from a similar anxiety towards nature as that depicted in Wells’s  text, although nature in Stapledon’s is non-human in a cosmological  and not earthbound sense. Last and First Men and Star Maker examine  human nature from vast evolutionary perspectives, thus providing a  vector for considering the various meanings attached to the concept of  human nature. The metaphysical theses that Stapledon explores in these  works open up spaces that converge with contemporary environmental  philosophical speculation. Stapledon’s Star Maker engages in significant ways with speculation on  cosmological nature’s alien otherness. metaphorical proto-gaian images  appear in Star Maker, resonating with Wells’s references to earth as a  ‘beast’ and a bountiful mother. When Stapledon’s narrator leaves earth  and sees ‘a creature alive but tranced and obscurely yearning to wake,’  he refers to an impression that would accrue symbolic resonance with  images of earth as gaia (Stapledon, 2004, 15). Stapledon uses this image  to speculate on ‘awakened worlds,’ where the intelligent population of a  planet attains communal consciousness (271). representations of stellar  intelligences, stars that the narrator learns ‘are best regarded as living  organisms, but organisms which are physiologically and psychologically  of a very peculiar kind,’ also appear in the narrative (194). Conversely, the figure of the Star maker is quite different from these  proto-gaian images: its ability to create worlds and universes aligns it  with terraforming; the Star maker embodies the human dream of world- building seen as a godlike endeavour. Terraforming as godlike creation  is central to many later terraforming narratives, and is here linked to  </page> <page sequence="12"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 29 Stapledon’s meditations on spacetime and origins. Star Maker magnifies  the scale of spacetime portrayed in Last and First Men, and it extends the  consideration of alien civilisations by using the device of a disembodied  narrator who eventually merges with the consciousness of other aliens  to form a pan-psychic cosmic mind. This cosmic mind’s search for the  Star maker ends with a vision of a being of vast power which, over the  course of many experiments in universe creation, matures to fulfil its  potential. The narrator experiences the sublime when confronting the  Star maker; its presence in the text operates as an emblem of nature’s  otherness. The narrator’s various theories about this being are attempts  to encompass its alien otherness with intellectual landscapes. Last and First Men chronicles two billion years of humanity’s  fluctuating development ‘from savagery towards civilization’ (Stapledon,  1966, 21, 276–77). Human nature for Stapledon is subject to the vagaries  of the cosmos, to socio-economic, cultural and political influence and  to philosophical ideas that underlie and provide the moral imperative  driving civilisation’s activity. against changing physical environments  Stapledon explores the beliefs that seem to justify – for each iteration  of humankind – the oppression of both human and non-human others.  He traces the intra-human and extraterrestrial conflicts and the ensuing  crises that lead to key events determining humanity’s future adaptation  of nature. Stapledon also raises questions of dominance related to the  mastery of nature that the development of progressively more advanced  forms of technology offers to civilisation. as in Wells’s book and  film adaptation and fearn’s short story, the overarching philosophical  vision explored is important – in the case of Last and First Men the  later terraforming episodes function as extensions of earlier tendencies  exhibited during episodes set on earth. Stapledon traces the rise and  fall of civilisations in a series of cycles to juxtapose each human species’  character in abstracted form. The narrator declares that Last and First Men’s aim is to ‘help you to  feel not only the vastness of time and space, but also the vast diversity  of mind’s possible modes’ (Stapledon, 1966, 17). Such vastness operates as  a conceptual contrast to humanity’s relative insignificance, as a precon- dition for the variety of evolved human types, and as a signifier of the  sublime. The threat that cosmological nature poses to humanity spurs its  search for greater powers of manipulation over the physical universe. The  narrator explains that ‘[Humanity’s] existence has ever been precarious.  at any stage of his career he might easily have been exterminated by  some slight alteration of his chemical environment, by a more than  usually malignant microbe, by a radical change of climate, or by the  manifold effects of his own folly’ (Stapledon, 1966, 314). Terraforming,  </page> <page sequence="13"> 30 Terraforming seen in the context of a history of technologies designed for the purpose  of controlling nature, is a technologically sophisticated answer to the  asymmetry Thesis. Wells’s The Shape of Things to Come shares the theme  of civilisation’s fragility, prominent in later terraforming narratives and  central to stories of ecotastrophe. This sense of human insignificance  and fragility when compared to the vastness of cosmological nature  leads to a sense of Promethean fear that raises issues pertinent to Lee’s  asymmetry and autonomy Theses. Star Maker begins with reflections on cosmological nature and human  insignificance that bear on the problem of an individual’s sense of place  within a cosmic schema: ‘[c]onsidered even without reference to our  belittling cosmical background, we were after all insignificant, perhaps  ridiculous. [...] even the cold stars, even the whole cosmos with all  its inane immensities could not convince me that this our prized atom  of community, imperfect as it was, short-lived as it must be, was not  significant’ (Stapledon, 2004, 9). This cosmological indifference is set  against a localised, human significance endued by the community of  marriage, that ‘intricate symbiosis’ (Stapledon, 2004, 7). recognition  of nature’s indifference thus stated is anti-humanist in mcKay’s sense,  but not misanthropic; it is the first step towards a critical examination  of the human individual and community and their place as part of an  indifferent cosmological nature. in a reference to Last and First Men in  Star Maker, this theme is again addressed in relation to the largest unit  of community: ‘[a]ll this long human story, most passionate and tragic in  the living, was but an unimportant, a seemingly barren and negligible  effort, lasting only for a few moments in the life of the galaxy’ (184).  The total human community, a category inclusive of alien societies in  Stapledon’s work, is insignificant from the perspective of the cosmos,  thus spurring civilisation’s effort to overcome its limitations. The sense of human insignificance motivates humanity’s intervention  with the physical world in Last and First Men: ‘the Second men were  oppressed by the brevity of human life, and the pettiness of the  individual’s achievement in comparison with the infinity round about  him which awaited apprehension and ad miration’ (Stapledon, 1966,  147). This ambivalent feeling of ‘apprehension and admiration’ for  nature’s otherness recognises a nature independent of humanity’s needs  and desires: non-human cosmological nature is fully autonomous and  possesses an asymmetrical relationship to humanity. ‘apprehension’ as  perception and appropriation suggests that human responses to nature’s  otherness combine attempts to understand and control that nature with a  respectful admiration predicated on a feeling of the sublime in response  to infinity and vastness. godlovitch suggests that a culture-inspired,  </page> <page sequence="14"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 31 centric natural aesthetic is necessarily ‘accountable to and acceptable only  within the bounds of human perception and human apprehension’ and  is therefore arbitrary (1994, 18). Stapledon’s cosmic perspective allows  multiple cultural approaches to nature to be explored while retaining  a sense of the contingency and limits involved in landscaping nature. in keeping with this focus on vast time periods, Stapledon depicts  human societies as progressing through several permutations of  pastoral, agricultural, and industrial stages, and through several types  of governments, including medieval and cosmopolitan structures. The  second men are envisioned at one point as ‘noble savages, [who] then  passed rapidly through the pastoral into the agricultural stage’ (1966,  139). each of these stages is marked by crises where development  past a critical threshold depends on humanity overcoming its natural  response to new technologies and socio-political clashes while flexibly  adapting to the physical world and appropriately managing natural  resources. nations progress through periods of nationalist, regional,  and then world-state governments and, towards the end of the text,  a global society turns towards the vast project of colonising space and  terraforming other planets. Last and First Men draws oppositions between  industrial stages informed by instrumental values of progress versus  utopian or idyllic stages, and between intellectual versus philosophical  tendencies. Terraforming is often predicated on attempts to gain mastery  over nature. in Last and First Men, Stapledon presents another motivation  for planetary adaptation. The fifth men terraform Venus in order to escape the impending  collision of the moon with earth. This catastrophe forces them to  make a choice that will determine the future development of human  civilisation: ‘[i]t was necessary either to remake man’s nature to suit  another planet, or to modify conditions upon another planet to suit  man’s nature’ (Stapledon, 1966, 246–47). They deem it impossible to  alter any existing human for habitation of either mars or Venus and  decide that terraforming mars would require them to bring water and  air in quantities that would make such alteration near impossible.  They therefore opt to terraform Venus rather than alter their own  physical and mental characteristics to suit the planet. This decision  implies that humanity will bring with it earth’s history when remaking  other planets, because the tendencies that make up human nature  guarantee a cyclical unfolding of earth’s cultural development on Venus,  with all its historical oppressions and transient achievements. This is  compounded by Stapledon’s highly ambivalent treatment of the fifth  men’s genocide of the indigenous Venusians. Conflict between horror  and guilt competes with the apparent necessity for self-preservation that  </page> <page sequence="15"> 32 Terraforming initially drives the fifth men to terraform Venus. anticipating Sparrow’s  concession that terraforming may be morally permissible if conducted to  ensure humanity’s survival, this episode raises questions regarding the  problematic ethics of survival by portraying the fifth men’s intellectual  accommodation of the Venusian genocide: the narrator explains that,  ‘[a]s for the murder of Venerian life, it was, indeed, terrible, but right.  it had been committed without hate; indeed rather in love’ (253). given the options of pantropy or the terraformation of mars,  this avowal appears a premature self-justification of imperialism.  Commenting on mark Sagoff’s call for ‘respect, regard, reverence,  affection and love’ as appropriate responses to nature, what godlovitch  calls an ‘imperialism of respect,’ the latter suggests that this ‘can quickly  degenerate into another nasty form of “respecting thine enemy” with  its concomitant call to kill with kindness’ (1994, 24, 26). Prior to this  episode humanity had engaged in remaking human nature and, later,  does so again. The third men realise that ‘[t]he present type of human  being [...] was but a rough and incoherent natural product. it was  time for man to take control of himself and remake himself upon a  nobler pattern’ (Stapledon, 1966, 150). The fifteenth men on neptune  also ‘conceived, as an enduring racial purpose, the will to remake  human nature upon an ampler scale’ (280). given the ubiquity of  this theme, the genocide of the Venusians appears as a deeply ironic  attempt to master both nature and other civilisations. When the fifth  men successfully occupy Venus the narrator glosses two hundred million  years in which ‘all [the] main phases of man’s life on earth were many  times repeated on Venus with characteristic differences,’ evidence of  a repeated history that suggests the lingering presence of intellectual  landscapes informing ideas of human nature and the significance of  the spaces humans inhabit (258). Deism and Teleology in Stapledon’s Essays of Myth Creation The eighteenth men are able to communicate telepathically with  individuals existing throughout time. They also intuit, but are unable  to communicate with, alien intelligences and their civilisations. These  insights encourage the eighteenth men to speak of a ‘spirit’ or ‘the  Soul of all,’ which awakens to conscious apprehension of itself and  the universe (Stapledon, 1966, 309–10). in a passage that strongly  anticipates Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s discussion of the noosphere in  The Phenomenon of Man (1965, first published in 1955 but completed in  1938), biblical voices underlie the narrator’s explanation that life aims  towards consciousness: </page> <page sequence="16"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 33 in the beginning there was great potency, but little form. and  the spirit slept as the multitude of discrete primordial existents.  Thenceforth there has been a long and fluctuating adventure towards  harmonious complexity of form, and towards the awakening of  the spirit into unity, knowledge, delight, and self-expression. and  this is the goal of all living, that the cosmos may be known,  and admired, and that it may be crowned with further beauties.  (Stapledon, 1966, 307) The narrator is fully aware that this belief is contingent. This image  combines a pseudo-pantheistic, vitalist view of cosmological nature  in which a ‘spirit’ pervades and constitutes all intelligent entities and  a teleological view in which the development of consciousness, as an  example of ‘harmonious complexity of form,’ is the goal of evolution.  The narrator speculates on the possibility that ‘the beautiful whole of  things is the work of some mind; [...] [or] whether some mind admires  it adequately as a whole of beauty.’ The awakening of the spirit is likened  to a vast music in which ‘each individual factor is itself determinant, both  of that which precedes and that which follows’ (Stapledon, 1966, 312).  evolution and history are the two shaping factors of cosmological nature,  which, in Star Maker, is the object of sublime aesthetic appreciation.  The eighteenth men disrespect nature’s otherness insofar as they  deny nature’s existence outside of this ‘religious’ or mystical belief.  nevertheless, the narrator, as one of the eighteenth men, admits that  this view may not adequately account for cosmological nature. in Star Maker, the disembodied group mind have long believed in  and are searching for a great creator-destroyer-observer that they call  the Star maker. The existence of a being that creates universes for its  own inscrutable purposes frames nature as teleological and so does not  adhere to Lee’s no-Teleology Thesis. This thesis rests on the distinction  between teleology and teleonomy. Teleology offers explanations for  an object’s existence based on the assumption that it is organised so  as to develop towards a predefined end point or goal. Because ‘earth  (nature) did not come into existence and/or continue to exist to serve  human purposes,’ it should not be viewed as teleologically oriented  towards humanity. instead, teleonomy is at work: ‘there are teleomatic  processes in abiotic nature which simply follow physical laws, such as  the law of gravity and the second law of thermodynamics,’ and ‘[i]n  biotic nature [...] organisms display programmed behaviour, the  programme being the product of natural selection’ (Lee, 1994, 92).  The no-Teleology Thesis claims that, although biotic and abiotic nature  can serve purposes for humans, animals, and plants, neither exists  </page> <page sequence="17"> 34 Terraforming solely for these purposes. in Star Maker, this thesis is compromised by  a teleology oriented towards the figure of the Star maker. Last and  First Men appears to satisfy this condition, but the voice of a strong  anthropic principle, in which the text’s view of the cosmos suggests  that its purpose is to provide the background for the full realisation of  a human ‘spirit,’ goes some way to negating this thesis. nevertheless,  the portrayal of the cosmos in Star Maker supports the notion that this  apparent teleology is a human interpretation, a landscape that only  inadequately accounts for nature. The Star maker’s relationship to the narrator is in many ways  consistent with Hailwood’s concept of nature’s otherness, yet it is  thoroughly overlaid with a deistic dimension. it is both the creator and  the essence of cosmological nature; its disinterestedness and puissance  mean that depictions of humankind’s relationship to the Star maker  observe the autonomy and asymmetry Theses, if not the no-Teleology  Thesis. nevertheless, an argument could be advanced that nature  here is in fact teleomatic: the sf representation of the radically alien  re-contextualises the religious basis of the creator figure as godhead,  recasting this image as a vector for nature’s otherness as ‘alien, inhuman,  dark’ (Stapledon, 2004, 96). The Star maker does not quite capture the  essence of a non-teleologic nature, although the narrator’s inability to  comprehend it opens up this potential: ‘if he is nothing, if the stars  and all else are not his creatures but self-subsistent, and if the adored  spirit is but an exquisite creature of our minds’ (99). as the narrator’s  experiences with the myriad inhabited worlds increase, he becomes more  and more inclined to view the Star maker teleomatically as ‘unreasoning  Creativity, at once blind and subtle, tender and cruel, caring only to  spawn and spawn the infinite variety of beings, conceiving here and  there among a thousand inanities a fragile loveliness’ (135). in a similar fashion, the third men in Last and First Men formulate  a belief system based precisely on the conceptual surplus of nature’s  otherness, but they join this to a religious concept of ‘Life as an  all-pervading spirit, expressing itself in myriad diverse individuals’  (Stapledon, 1966, 193–94). They engage in the torture of ‘lower animals’  through biological engineering as a form of worship, which offers a way  to landscape nature that allows them to account for the environment’s  significance in human terms, even if their focus on pain disrespects the  autonomy of other animals. They take as a blueprint for relationships  between humankind and nature a view of evolution as a dialectic in  which the environment functions as the background that shapes the  development of life. The narrator notes that this ‘backgrounding,’ in  which the environment’s autonomy is denied, leads the third men to  </page> <page sequence="18"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 35 unsystematically emphasise physical pain as the chief aesthetic mode  appropriate to respect for nature. emphasis on pain reflects a Hobbesian  conception of evolution as ‘nature red in tooth and claw,’ what the  eighteenth men call ‘Life’s victory and defeat.’ elevating pain based  on such intellectual landscapes leads to the uneven worship of the  environment, which the narrator describes as a form of ‘sadism’ in  itself (194). nature thus conceived disrespects the no-Teleology Thesis  because sentient life is positioned as dependent on humankind for its  evolution and development. This situation is grounded in the third men’s disrespect of one aspect  of nature’s otherness: by landscaping sentient nature as ‘lower’ manifes- tations of their pseudo-pantheistic concept of life (sentience), and by  complementing this belief with a philosophy that takes as a lesson from  nature an emphasis on pain, they conclude that torturous biological  manipulation leads to the closest possible apprehension of nature. as  they believe themselves the highest expression of consciousness, they  take it upon themselves to disrespect nature’s autonomy and raise  ‘lower’ animals to their status. The contradiction between respecting  nature’s otherness and landscaping nature by investing animals with  the potential for transcendence recalls the theme of terraforming as  the human duty to bring life to other planets. This episode parallels  bodily modification and terraforming, demonstrating how the two  endeavours grow out of similar beliefs about humanity’s relationship  to nature’s otherness. The narrator calls his vision of the Star maker and the cosmos ‘a  fantastic reflex of itself, an echo, a symbol, a myth, a crazy dream,  not wholly without significance,’ which points to the impossibility of  accounting for nature’s otherness outside of necessarily partial human  landscapes (Stapledon, 2004, 232). The Star maker embodies the godlike  power of creation; its ability to create universes of worlds parallels  the aspiration behind the human endeavour to create new worlds  via terraforming and, at greater levels of adaptation to the landscape,  astrophysical engineering. The Star maker can therefore be seen as the  astrophysical engineer par excellence, although this would be to apply a  particular landscape to a concept that retains a surplus of otherness. When the narrator returns to earth as the individual at the narrative’s  beginning, his experiences lead him to critique not only the limits of a  science and philosophy that would pretend to a mastery of the world,  but a complete knowledge that would manifest this disrespect of nature’s  otherness: ‘man’s science was a mere mist of numbers; his philosophy  but a fog of words. His very perception of this rocky grain and all its  wonders was but a shifting and lying apparition’ (Stapledon, 2004,  </page> <page sequence="19"> 36 Terraforming 259). ‘man’s science’ offers a global sense of place that is completely  constituted by human knowledge; it is a landscape that denies the  presence of nature’s otherness. The narrator contrasts this sense of place  with ‘the astronomical and hypercosmical immensity’ and the smaller  unit of community that his marriage represents, affirming the latter  as the appropriate space for his limited human existence (Stapledon,  2004, 259). in contrast to Wells’s release of experimental science from  deductive intellectualism, Stapledon’s narrator warns against a divorce  between intelligence and ‘spiritual sensibility’: ‘[t]he mastery of physical  force often produced a mania for power, and the dissection of society  into two alien classes, the powerful and the enslaved’ (246). The spiritual  is emphasised as a necessary counterbalance to an exclusive reliance on  a materialism that leads to a mastery of nature. The narrator of Star  Maker does not deny the presence of nature’s otherness; it is his spiritual  experience of the cosmos and the Star maker that lead him to affirm  this vision of cosmological nature’s alien otherness as an appropriate  perspective for framing human relations. The narrator’s journey in Star Maker takes him through many worlds,  and over its course he joins with other minds into a group consciousness  that eventually extends into a cosmos-spanning mind. Yet, despite  knowing ‘the whole extent of space and time,’ the i of the cosmical  mind ‘look[ed] about me with the same overpowering awe, the same  abashed and tongue-tied worship as that which human travellers in the  desert feel under the stars’ (Stapledon, 2004, 212). When this cosmic  mind confronts the Star maker, the history of intellectual landscaping,  in which notions of deities are used to explain the universe, helps  conceptualise the awesome presence of this entity. The narrator charac- terises its vision of the Star maker and creation as a ‘fantasy’ that its  ‘cosmical mind conceived’ in order to comprehend just a small part of  an experience that exceeds its ability to landscape (225): i, too, sought to capture the infinite spirit, the Star maker, in an  image spun by my finite though cosmical nature [...] this image,  this symbol that my cosmical mind had conceived under the stress  of inconceivable experience, broke and was transformed in the very  act of my conceiving it, so inadequate was it to the actuality of the  experience. (Stapledon, 2004, 227) awe is joined to love as the creation’s response to the creator. The cosmic  mind is rejected by the Star maker, leading the narrator to realise that  ‘the creator, if he should love his creature, would be loving only a part of  himself; but the creature, praising the creator, praises an infinity beyond  </page> <page sequence="20"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 37 himself’ (Stapledon, 2004, 228). The Star maker, whether conceived of  as purely deistic or as an aspect of cosmological nature, is the object of  the cosmic mind’s love. Love flowing in the opposite direction would be  narcissism. The narrator can only love the Star maker as he conceives it,  in an intellectually landscaped form that does not represent it accurately  as subject or object. Wells, fearn and Stapledon engage with the debate about materialism  versus vitalism that dominated ecological thinking during the interwar  period. Unlike Wells, Stapledon’s vision of the cosmos expresses  elements of vitalism. environmental narcissism, the image of nature  as a reflection of humanity, is a theme that is often returned to in  terraforming narratives such as ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles  (1958) and Kim Stanley robinson’s Mars trilogy (1996c [1992]; 1996b  [1993]; 1996a). Terraforming disrespects nature’s otherness insofar as it  takes human landscapes to fully represent nature. in The Shape of Things  to Come, humanity’s physical mastery of nature is a direct expression  of the urge to overcome its asymmetric relationship to nature’s  otherness, and in the novel’s depiction of an increasingly technologised  globalisation and humanity’s future plans for terraforming earth, it  recapitulates this narcissistic landscaping. fearn explores the opportu- nities for the technocratic organisation and management of earth and  other planets that science offers. Star Maker uses the radical otherness of  cosmological nature to dethrone ideas of progress and of conquering the  cosmos, which often masquerade as a desire for contact with otherness.  Stapledon’s ineffable Star maker acts as a vector for nature’s otherness  and defies attempts to make the alien coherent with a particular anthro- pocentric paradigm. examples of nature as cosmological, non-human  and alien fundamentally undermine the protagonists’ relationship to  the cosmos, forcing them to re-evaluate their position within this new  conception of nature. By realigning these relationships Stapledon does  not emphasise humankind’s connectedness to nature so much as he  foregrounds the differing modes of otherness between humans and the  rest of nature. Stapledon makes use of this dynamic of confrontation to  explore and critique the assumptions underlying conceptions of human  nature and cosmological nature’s otherness. The narrator of Star Maker  suggests that the narrative’s attempt to reorient humankind’s outlook  through an extended engagement with philosophical speculation  about cosmological nature may influence attitudes on earth: ‘perhaps  the attempt to see our turbulent world against a background of stars  may, after all, increase, not lessen, the significance of the present  human crisis. it may also strengthen our charity toward one another’  (Stapledon, 2004, 4). </page> <page sequence="21"> 38 Terraforming Pre-1940s Proto-Gaian Living Worlds a cluster of three short stories dealing with proto-gaian living worlds  was published between 1932 and 1934 in the american pulp market.  edmond Hamilton’s ‘The earth-Brain’ (1936 [1932]), Jack Williamson’s  ‘Born of the Sun’ (1934), and Laurence manning’s ‘The Living galaxy’  (1934) are examples of what mike ashley calls ‘cosmic sf,’ which he  traces to f. orlin Tremaine’s advocacy of the ‘thought experiment’ in  1933 (2000, 231). ashley argues that the narrative thought experiment  ‘took space opera to its better extremes, considering not just the  exploration of space but the nature of time, space and the universe’ (231).  The connection between Stapledon’s use of cosmic scales to enlarge the  scope of human perspectives and these proto-gaian thought variants  is suggestive of a critical element involved in imagining alternatives  to conceptions of cosmological nature. echoing Wells’s account of the  scientific organisation of the environment, manning’s The Man Who  Awoke (1979 [1933]) reflects on the industrial overuse of natural resources  and explores, using the language of ecological resource management, the  shape of a future arboreal society. manning’s presentation of a planetary  environment that has been actively forested and managed according to  ecological principles positions this story as an early geoengineering text. Two scientific romances familiar to Wells and Stapledon preceded  this cluster of proto-gaian pulp stories. m.P. Shiel’s The Purple Cloud  (2004 [1901]) portrays an early instance of a living world. Hamilton’s  ‘The earth-Brain’ echoes elements of The Purple Cloud, establishing one  of the early dialogues opened up by the motif. arthur Conan Doyle  was increasingly interested in the occult and spiritualism by the time  ‘When the World Screamed’ (2000) was published in 1928, twenty-seven  years after The Purple Cloud; that Shiel’s, Doyle’s and Hamilton’s stories  blend the supernatural and sf implies a connection between gaia and  spiritualism that Lovelock was unwilling to completely dissociate from  the gaia hypothesis. Jon Turney highlights Doyle’s scientific romance as  a potential precursor to Lovelock’s gaia hypothesis, and, though it is not  certain Lovelock read it before 1965, Doyle’s popularity and Lovelock’s  avowed love of sf suggest it is likely (2003, 77). These stories situate their proto-gaian living worlds within the  bounds of the last of the terrae incognitae, at the arctic in Shiel’s and  Hamilton’s case and, in Williamson’s and Doyle’s, at the earth’s centre.  ‘When the World Screamed’ frames the living earth within the scientific  paradigm of a hollow world, but, in contrast to Shiel’s connection  of earth’s processes to mythic themes, Doyle’s use parodies scientific  progress. The hollow world, already an outdated scientific hypothesis  </page> <page sequence="22"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 39 when The Purple Cloud was published, is reopened through the speculative  element of the text to offer an alternative to the dominant view that  ‘the centre of the earth is liquid heat’ (Doyle, 2000). in these scientific  romances and the 1930s cluster of living world pulp stories, cosmic horror  and an sf sense of wonder are the dominant responses to confrontations  with threatening living worlds. Proto-Gaian Scientific Romance: M.P. Shiel’s The Purple Cloud  and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s ‘When the World Screamed’ Shiel portrays the earth as monstrous, thus associating horror with  the little-known arctic, a common fin-de-siècle motif of a landscape at  the limits of scientific knowledge in 1901. The Purple Cloud echoes both  Shelley’s Frankenstein (1998 [1818]) and The Last Man (1996 [1826]): adam  Jeffson recounts his experiences as one of two survivors left on earth  after a volcanic cloud of gas exterminates humankind. This apocalyptic  narrative develops the theme of isolation and offers a redemptive adam  and eve myth set against the living planet motif, creating a space to  focus consideration onto human responses to non-human nature. Jeffson  encounters a lake at the pole, ‘the old eternal inner secret of the Life of  this earth, which it was a most burning shame for a man to see [...] this  fluid was the substance of a living creature.’ He vaguely recalls ‘a creature  with many dull and anguished eyes’ and ‘the appalling nightmare and  black abysm of sensations’ this confrontation causes. resonant with  Stapledon’s Star Maker, Jeffson relates his vision to ‘fancy,’ an ‘impression,  or dream, or notion,’ and finally to ‘madness’ in an attempt to deny its  existence (Shiel, 2004). This grotesque vision occurs after Jeffson crosses  a boundary into a world aligned with darkness, nightmare and horror,  thus establishing the structural theme of trespass. The creature itself  is composed of fluid, which complements this trespass and potential  breakdown of spatial boundaries with that of indeterminate monstrous  form. The themes of the infinite (‘eternal’) and silence (‘secret’) are  central to Jeffson’s response to the living earth. edmund Burke locates the origin of the sublime in objects that  excite a sense of self-preservation and which therefore turn on feelings  of pain or danger. He claims that ‘terror is in all cases whatsoever,  either openly or latently the ruling principle of the sublime’ (1998,  102). Shiel firmly associates the creature with supernatural terror  and intensifies this association by locating Jeffson’s confrontation at  the arctic. The unfamiliarity of the landscape and the uncertainty  of Jeffson’s description tap into Burke’s observation that obscurity  enhances the terror of the sublime: ‘[w]hen we know the full extent  </page> <page sequence="23"> 40 Terraforming of any danger, when we can accustom our eyes to it, a great deal  of the apprehension vanishes’ (102). This insight connects the search  for comprehensive geographical knowledge, essentially a scientific and  colonial quest of discovery and exploration, with the desire to encompass  the obscure and to familiarise and therefore mitigate the terror and  sublimity of the unknown. Jeffson’s encounter occurs in the supernatural context of a manichean  struggle between cosmic ‘Powers’ of light and darkness, a duality that  is literalised by the Powers’ internal struggle for Jeffson’s soul. The  catastrophe underscores humankind’s fragility compared to a nature  Jeffson sees as cruel and heedless. He describes a feminised earth as  ‘dark and moody, sudden and ill-fated,’ who ‘rends her young like a  cannibal lioness.’ in another episode he uses this metaphor again when  addressing nature, calling it a ‘dark-minded mother, with thy passionate  cravings after the infinite, thy regrets, and mighty griefs, and comatose  sleeps, and sinister coming doom’ (Shiel, 2004). george r. Stewart  would later echo this theme in a biblical context in Earth Abides (1961  [1949]), which contains passages depicting earth’s autonomous existence  after civilisation’s destruction by an unknown plague. These intellectual  landscapes associate earth with the infinite, which Burke identifies as  a major source of the sublime; Jeffson’s ascription of infinity to the  non-human world highlights his sense of an asymmetric relationship  to earth’s unfathomable otherness. When Jeffson thinks that ‘nothing  could be more appallingly insecure than living on a planet,’ he gives  voice to Promethean fears that nature is not neutral but antagonistic  to humanity. Conversely he also positively contrasts this intellectual  landscape to the ice, arguing that ‘the firm land is health and sanity, and  dear to the life of man.’ Shiel’s use of the image highlights a negative,  spiritual response to the immensities of earth and the cosmos, but this  relationship is ambivalent: he ultimately realises that the feminised  earth ‘is old and wise [...] for great is the earth, and her ages, but man  “passeth away”’ (Shiel, 2004). returning from the arctic, Jeffson witnesses the effect of the still  unknown natural catastrophe and experiences ‘that abysmal desolation  of loneliness, and sense of a hostile and malign universe bent upon  eating me up’ (Shiel, 2004). in his less lucid moments, Jeffson  entertains the fear that his identity will be engulfed by the feminised  earth. Without a social context to provide points of recognition or  self-definition, Jeffson finds it increasingly difficult to maintain his  self-awareness: ‘more and more the earth over-grows me, wooes me,  assimilates me; so that i ask myself this question: “must i not, in  time, cease to be a man, and become a small earth, precisely her  </page> <page sequence="24"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 41 copy, extravagantly weird and fierce, half-demoniac, half-ferine, wholly  mystic – morose and turbulent – fitful, and deranged, and sad – like  her?”’ (Shiel, 2004). What is feared here would later be sought after by  others. This passage anticipates deep ecology’s mystical and transcendent  identification with nature, in which the subject’s ego is subsumed. Jack  g. Voller notes that this relationship was anticipated by ‘the romantic  visionary mind,’ which explored ‘an identifying engagement with the  numinous perceived to be informing nature’ (1989, 138). Jeffson fears  that nature will incorporate his identity, thus denying him autonomy  and eventually leading to the elimination of his ego. Conversely, his  forced isolation and his ascription of fitfulness, derangement and sadness  to the earth are instances of landscaping in which Jeffson expands  his ego into nature. in either case, the theme of being ‘one’ with  nature is implicit in this passage, and yet Jeffson recognises that this  connection balances both similarity and difference. His relationship to  nature retains an otherness that cannot be overcome by knowledge,  yet identification can be predicated on shared origins: [h]er [earth’s] method of forming coal, geysers and hot sulphur- springs, and the jewels, and the atols and coral reefs; the  metamorphic rocks of sedimentary origin, like gneiss, the plutonic  and volcanic rocks, rocks of fusion, and the unstratified masses  which constitute the basis of the crust; and harvests, the burning  flame of flowers, and the passage from the vegetable to the animal:  i do not know them, but they are of her, and they are like me,  molten in the same furnace of her fiery heart. (Shiel, 2004) This view of earth’s natural processes breaks down the radical separation  of the human/nature duality by recognising humankind’s shared origins  with diverse non-human others. it erects boundaries by establishing  distinctions between humankind and nature as much as it offers identifi- cation. Jeffson’s landscapes keep nature’s otherness in view even as they  attempt to reduce difference. They negotiate between natural processes  and a mysticism that is productive of Promethean fear and the sublime. While Shiel focuses on the individual’s sense of cosmic horror towards  the immensities of earth and the cosmos, he nevertheless assigns to the  social sphere responsibility for the projection of intellectual landscapes  derived from human experience: man’s notion of a Heaven, a Paradise, reserved for the spirits of the  good, clearly arose from impressions which the earth made upon  his mind: for no Paradise can be fairer than this; just as his notion  </page> <page sequence="25"> 42 Terraforming of a Hell arose from the squalid mess into which his own foolish  habits of thought and action turned this Paradise. (Shiel, 2004) an interest in social worlds accompanies portrayals of an individual’s  experience of cosmic horror. Jeffson’s claim that paradisal landscapes  are based on experience of non-human nature while their converse  is a consequence of culture assigns accountability for the creation of  nature’s fear-inspiring asymmetry not only to the human management  of earth’s resources, but more generally to humankind’s politico-cultural  attitudes. Jeffson landscapes the planet as a terrestrial ship, while a  literal ship also provides transport for the arctic expedition and Jeffson’s  later international travel. His experiences during these solitary years  lead him to orient himself towards civilisation’s ruin and nature as  the only other sources of interaction. He metaphorically extends his  phenomenal experience of the world to earth’s processes; by relating  the eruption of the purple cloud in language that ties it to the beating  of waves against his ship, he establishes a relationship of microcosm– macrocosm between his journey and ‘this planetary ship of earth,’ using  this model to understand the catastrophe as ‘a wave rather which she  [the earth] had reserved, and has spouted, from her own un-motherly  entrails...’ (Shiel, 2004). in this context the catastrophe itself can be  read as a punishment for civilisation’s transgressions. The image of the  earth as a ship sailing through space contributes another dimension to  Jeffson’s anxiety towards nature by foregrounding the planet’s fragility.  This metaphor, like Wells’s reference to an abundant earth opened up  by geoengineering, echoes Henry george’s description of earth as a  well-provisioned ship. george uses this image to highlight the human  exploitation made possible by an elite’s possession of a planet’s abundant  resources, thus grounding his arguably justified faith in earth’s material  ability to sustain the human population in 1879. in arthur Conan Doyle’s ‘When the World Screamed,’ george edward  Challenger, the distinguished if intolerant professor of The Lost World,  sets out to prove his hypothesis that earth is an organism whose skin  is the eight-mile crust of the planet’s surface. Challenger contracts the  narrator, Peerless Jones, to complete the final stage of a drilling project  aimed at piercing the flesh of the uncovered organism. Challenger  considers this project ‘one of the greatest experiments – i may even say  the greatest experiment – in the history of the world’ (Doyle, 2000),  and explains that ‘[“]the world upon which we live is itself a living  organism, endowed, as i believe, with a circulation, a respiration, and a  nervous system of its own.” Clearly the man was a lunatic’ (Doyle, 2000).  Challenger’s thesis anticipates the concept of planetary homeostasis,  </page> <page sequence="26"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 43 while Jones’s reaction prefigures the resistance Lovelock faced from  the scientific community upon first proposing the gaia hypothesis.  Lovelock retrospectively claimed the Scottish scientist James Hutton as  one of the precursors of the gaia hypothesis, who argued in 1785 that  ‘the earth was like an animal and that its proper study should be by  physiology’ (Lovelock, 1995, 9). The french physiologist Claude Bernard  first recognised organisms’ self-regulating properties as the ‘wisdom of  the body,’ which Walter Cannon referred to in the 1930s when he coined  ‘homeostasis’ (Lovelock, 1995, 18–19). Lovelock calls the study of earth  as gaia geophysiology, which draws together this combination of the  physiological and geophysical sciences and echoes what is made literal  in this story: traditional literary images of a personified or zoomorphic  earth that act as intellectual landscapes prefiguring a colonial approach  to physical space. Challenger’s ostensible motivation is the search for scientific knowledge:  he points out that ‘[t]o know once for all what we are, why we are,  where we are, is that not in itself the greatest of all human aspirations?’  Behind this lies a narrative of conquest that informs his language: ‘i  propose to let the earth know that there is at least one person, george  edward Challenger, who calls for attention – who, indeed, insists upon  attention’ (Doyle, 2000). Having dominated the academic sphere and  amassed a fortune, his ambition escalates, but his declaration suggests  that underlying this disinterested scientific inquiry is an infantile desire  for recognition and attention. His desire, as two of the characters point  out, is coupled to a general lack of care and respect and is overlaid with  personal aggrandisement, qualities that contribute both to his notoriety  and to the appeal of his entrepreneurial individualism. edward malone calls Challenger ‘a primitive cave-man in a lounge  suit,’ but clearly admires his achievements, also calling him ‘the greatest  brain in europe, with a driving force behind it that can turn all his  dreams into facts.’ The scientific pursuit of knowledge, joined to a  disregard of its effects, is characterised as a fundamental yet primitive  trait of human nature. Despite many lawsuits, Challenger continues to  show little respect for the environment. in an episode that exhibits an  early interest in issues of environmental preservation, malone reports  how Challenger ‘[s]aid [the machinery] was one-tenth of an inch out of  estimate, so he simply chucked it by the wayside.’ expressive of fears that  the British countryside would be despoiled at the whim of entrepreneurs  and industrialists, the narrator explicitly aligns the mistreatment of  social and natural worlds by the wealthy and pioneering scientist. He  explains that ‘[a]n audience after one of Challenger’s harangues usually  felt as if, like the earth, its protective epidermis had been pierced and its  </page> <page sequence="27"> 44 Terraforming nerves laid bare’ (Doyle, 2000). Challenger’s achievement in penetrating  earth’s eight-mile crust is emblematic of his capacity for confrontation  and mastery. Jones, an expert in artesian borings, enacts the relationship of  dominance Challenger poses to the earth. Challenger internalises the  gap between himself and others, describing Jones in unflattering terms  as a mechanical instrument to be directed by his intelligence and will.  He naturalises this relationship when he claims that ‘[a] certain analogy  runs through all nature’: ‘[y]ou, sir, represent the mosquito. Your  artesian borer takes the place of the stinging proboscis. The brain has  done its work. exit the thinker. enter the mechanical one, the peerless  one, with his rod of metal. Do i make myself clear?’ (Doyle, 2000).  This insect analogy anticipates Hamilton’s and Williamson’s use of the  trope and is reiterated in many later living world narratives, standing  as a model of humankind’s dependence on earth. This asymmetry is  connected to another prevalent symbol, the gender-coded drill that  stands opposed to the feminised earth. Upon seeing the earth’s flesh,  Jones exclaims, ‘good Lord! [...] and am i to plunge a harpoon into  that beast!’ thus paralleling Challenger’s hubristic domination of the  landscape and ahab’s attempt to dominate the sea and its eponymous  denizen in Moby-Dick. The narrator’s closing words, ‘[i]t has been the  common ambition of mankind to set the whole world talking. To set  the whole world screaming was the privilege of Challenger alone,’ locate  Challenger at the forefront of civilisation’s progress, an achievement  made possible by an ethically vacuous science and technology that  does not in itself represent any progress in human nature, but rather  represents an extension of basic human responses to nature. Jones  refers to the living planet as ‘mother earth’ when he credits Challenger  with an ironised panegyric at the successful conclusion of the project –  ‘Challenger the super scientist, Challenger the arch-pioneer, Challenger  the first man of all men whom mother earth had been compelled to  recognize’ – and reports that ‘nowhere did the injured planet emit such  a howl as at the actual point of penetration, but she showed that she was  indeed one entity by her conduct elsewhere’ (Doyle, 2000). The image  constructed is of a scientist raping the world, an action supported by a  self-centred application of technology. Jones witnesses a scene that indexes an alternative mode of relating  to nature’s otherness. a system of elevators from the earth’s surface to  its unshielded flesh operate as a metaphorical time machine through  geologic time. The strata revealed by the borings are a sign of earth’s  age, and Jones’s reaction to this signifier of the infinite is one of wonder:  ‘[t]he archaic rocks varied wonderfully in colour, and i can never forget  </page> <page sequence="28"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 45 one broad belt of rose-coloured felspar, which shone with an unearthly  beauty before our powerful lamps’ (Doyle, 2000). ‘Unearthly’ is a strange  adjective to attach to the earth, one which paradoxically constructs our  native planet as alien and reveals the extent of the limits to intellectual  landscapes when confronted with the earth’s strata, a geography where  temporal estrangement increases the further down you go (down is back  in time). Jones’s sense of awe and wonder towards the alien beauty of  earth’s geology and age offers an alternative to Challenger’s antago- nistic attitude to nature’s otherness. earth’s familiarity is a consequence  of interactions between humankind and nature that elide its alien  otherness. Despite fogg’s complaint that ‘terraforming’ describes the  task of adapting planets to resemble earth and so cannot be applied to  it, the phrase ‘an unearthly beauty’ calls attention to the longstanding  human project of adaptation, in which the earth has been landscaped  both intellectually and physically in order to shape it to humanity’s  needs and desires. The Pulp Sf Proto-Gaian Cluster edmond Hamilton’s ‘The earth-Brain’ describes the otherness encountered  by explorers at the far regions of the earth. Landon recounts his  expedition to the arctic, where he discovers a mountain that literally  houses the earth’s brain. The expedition dismisses the accompanying  Sherpas’ warning of a mythic prohibition on approaching the mountain,  but one member entertains the possibility of its truth: Why couldn’t earth be a living organism instead of just a mass of  inanimate matter? it seems an inanimate mass to us, it is true, but  so must a human being seem an inanimate mass to the microbes  that live on and in that being. earth might be a living organism,  all the planets might be organisms, of scale and nature so different  from us that we mites who swarm upon it cannot even comprehend  it. and if it is living it could possess consciousness and intelligence,  perhaps intelligence operating on planes and for ends entirely alien  to us. (Hamilton, 1936, 144) Both Lovelock and his collaborator Lynn margulis employ the same  analogies concerning the relationship between macrocosm and  microcosm, between earth’s gaian system and its constituent parts.  Speculative questioning extends the living world and the scope of terrae  incognitae throughout the solar system. The assertion that the human  cognitive faculty cannot encompass this larger system reinforces the  </page> <page sequence="29"> 46 Terraforming asymmetry Thesis by fuelling a sense of cosmic horror, itself a form  of Promethean fear. Crucially, non-human nature is not inert matter  explicable in mechanistic terms, but an organic and autonomous creature  in its own right. ernest J. Yanarella identifies such challenges to the  rational-mechanistic landscape as central to later treatments of the gaia  hypothesis (2001, 250–51). morris warns the reader of humankind’s endemic lack of knowledge  in contrast to a worldview that promises coherent and complete  knowledge of nature: ‘in your unbelief remember this – that of all things  in the universe we men know least really of this earth we live upon’  (Hamilton, 1936, 137). The expedition discovers truth behind the myth  when they encounter ‘a giant ovoid of light or force that towered there  at the cone-cavern’s centre’ (157–58). This meeting echoes the confusion  attendant on confronting the supernatural entity in The Purple Cloud.  The ovoid inspects and subdues the interlopers with ‘senses having  nothing to do with any senses we knew but operating on planes entirely  different’; Landon relates how ‘[t]he impact of that will was tangible,  overwhelming. it seemed partly to replace, to usurp, my own will and  mind’ (Hamilton, 1936, 160, 163). Subversion grants a brief psychological  connection to the alien intelligence, and through the resulting human/ non-human duality of mind he is granted an awe-inspiring vision of  the universe: ‘[m]y great body was racing at awful speed through vast  leagues of infinite space! far off across those immensities of space i  was aware of other living earths, other planets, some larger and some  smaller than i, but each living in the same vast way as i lived, each  with its own great brain!’ (Hamilton, 1936, 164–65). Communication  with a planetary alien intelligence appears in embryonic form where  contact involves an asymmetric non-human dominance of the channels  of communication. Human consciousness approaches indistinguishability  from the earth-Brain, leading to a model of the transpersonal self in  which the overcoming of one’s ego is inverted to become an undermining  of that ego. This scene taps into the sense of cosmic horror through the  image of a universe populated by unfathomable living planets, symbols  of cosmological nature’s otherness that confound the expedition’s search  for scientific knowledge. The explorers attempt to gain a measure of  control over nature by occupying it through exploration and subsumption  into their scientific schema, thus annexing it to the human sphere and  reducing its otherness to an identity. The expedition’s ethnocentrism is challenged by a contrast between  their worldview and ‘traditional’ knowledge from other cultures, thus  undermining the stability of their understanding of the universe  and deflating their faith in reason and science. a critique of colonial  </page> <page sequence="30"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 47 tendencies informs this aspect of the text, as the Sherpas take on the  role of representatives of a primitive society unclouded by faith in the  comprehensiveness of scientific knowledge. This contrast implicitly  extends the text’s scope to include other ideologies underpinning  notions of Western civilisation and progress. The Sherpas are guides  and harbingers of an ancient and dangerous knowledge, warning of  ‘the forbidden mountain at the earth’s top – shunned by all our race!’  (Hamilton, 1936, 142). They are also ciphers whose role is to provide  a foil for notions of a Western science allied to a dogmatic view of the  non-human. When the earth-Brain kills the other two members of the  expedition, Landon fires at it in self-defence. His action is described as  a sin against nature, a transgression of the mythic prohibition spoken  of by the Sherpas: ‘[c]olossal anger emanated from it at the same  moment like a wave of destroying force, and as that cosmic wrath  swept through me i knew that i had committed blackest sin against  the universe in daring to attack the brain of the living earth-body  upon which dwelt i and all my tiny race!’ (Hamilton, 1936, 170). The  earth-Brain exacts retribution for Landon’s violent reaction against the  asymmetrical relationship between cosmological nature and humankind.  The earth-Brain’s earthquake-inducing pursuit of Landon across the  globe suggests the theme of humanity’s regulation as part of a system  and assigns that responsibility to the earth. The living planet operates in  this capacity as a check to human domination, with tremors operating  as a sublime symbol of earth’s reckoning. morris implies as much when  he warns that ‘we who consider ourselves masters of all are not but a  race of microscopic parasites dwelling upon the vast and strangely living  body of that earth-Brain’ (Hamilton, 1936, 181). Jack Williamson’s ‘Born of the Sun’ (1934) negotiates the boundary  between cosmic horror and the sf technological sublime. earth and the  other planetary bodies are eggs, their parent the sun, which ‘expands  and contracts in the rhythm of the sun-spot cycle, with a beat like the  pulse of a living thing’ (Williamson, 1934, 16). The moon’s hatching  prefigures earth’s fate and relates dread and majesty when the narrative  characterises the living world as ‘more than anything else like the  eldritch, gorgeous streamers of the Sun’s corona’ (25), thus tapping  into the language of weird fiction through the adjunct ‘eldritch,’ often  associated with Lovecraft and meaning ‘[w]eird, ghostly, unnatural,  frightful, hideous’ (‘eldritch, adj.’). further description of ‘[a] body, both  horrible and beautiful’ and reference to ‘[t]he shadows it cast, inky-black,  green-fringed, [which] were uncanny – dreadful,’ show an ambivalence  that accompanies revelation of nature’s alien otherness and subverts  dominant understandings of earth (Williamson, 1934, 25). </page> <page sequence="31"> 48 Terraforming Williamson connects the sublimity of the living world to beauty,  two concepts that Burke considers separately as centring respectively  on pain and pleasure. Beauty for Burke is a social quality that attracts  humans into an engagement with the other. Unlike the sublime, it is  founded on the submission of the object to the subject: ‘we submit to  what we admire, but we love what submits to us; in one case we are  forced, in the other we are flattered into compliance’ (Burke, 1998, 147).  The tension between the sublime and beauty is an important cognitive  structure for framing human relationships to the non-human. Ultimately,  it suggests that beauty as an aesthetic response to nature’s otherness  is complicit in domination of nature and so cannot offer aesthetic  grounds for ecologically sound relationships to the non-human. Yet  Patrick D. murphy highlights the androcentrism implicit in the notion  that triumphing over the fear, awe or horror engendered by sublime  landscapes is one source of the pleasure derived from the experience  of a dangerous nature (murphy, 2012, 82). This sense of triumph also  undermines the Burkean sublime as an appropriate aesthetic response  that would nurture ecologically sound relationships to nature. murphy  explores an ecofeminist revisioning of the sublime and points out that  while the ‘[r]ecognition of the physical limitations could also lead to an  awareness of human interconnectedness and interdependency with other  human beings and other living entities on the planet,’ this dependency  is not emphasised ‘in most literary representations of the sublime’ (83).  in many of the works examined in this chapter, humankind’s physical  limitations are emphasised in such a way as to highlight humankind’s  fundamental dependency on non-human nature. Barron Kane is another explorer figure, who discovers and brings  knowledge of the earth’s nature to his nephew foster, an inventor and  the story’s protagonist. Kane has infiltrated a mysterious sect where,  echoing Hamilton’s use of Sherpas as homogenised foils for Western  (rational scientific) landscapes, he discovers ‘that oriental insight had  seen the truth hidden from our dogmatic western minds’ (Williamson,  1934, 16). acting against the sect’s fatalistic belief that humanity should  resign itself to extinction during earth’s catastrophic birth, foster and  his uncle, accompanied by foster’s fiancée, June, and a selection of  colonists, hasten to construct a functioning spaceship to escape earth’s  destruction. Social responses to the catastrophe are subordinated to  foster as heroic individual. Viewing the moon’s destruction, foster and  June affirm the importance of the smallest unit of community as a  response to individual insignificance: ‘it was lovely – and horrible –’ </page> <page sequence="32"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 49 [...] ‘our world must go – that way, dear –’ he breathed; and her shivery  tiny whisper finished: ‘But we have – each other –’ (Williamson,  1934, 25) Community is conveyed by romantic cliché, but foster’s status and the  masculinist heroism of the text emphasise his individualism and hubris.  He is elevated from the group in a version of the transcendent self when,  ‘[i]n a moment of crystal vision,’ he sees himself ‘not as one man fighting  for his own life, but the champion of humanity, battling for ultimate  survival’ (Williamson, 1934, 20). Barron Kane supports foster’s vision  when he says ‘[i]t’s up to you, now, to save the seed of mankind,’ and  he evokes the adam and eve myth also utilised in The Purple Cloud, but  transplanted to the geography of space: ‘[t]he children of foster and June  will conquer space, to the farthermost one of you!’ (38). The obligation  to remain independent of the planets is incompatible with this colonial  urge to conquer space. foster’s attempt to combat both nature and the  mobs incited by the sect is a struggle between submitting to the other  and forcing the other into submission. invention gives humanity a way to free itself from its dependency  on nature. The spaceship, christened the Planet, ‘can sail on forever,  Barron. it’s a little world, itself, independent of the Sun’ (Williamson,  1934, 22). The insect metaphor is revisited in conjunction with this  theme when foster realises that, because of his anti-gravity invention,  ‘men will now be small parasites no longer, to be crushed like vermin  by any chance tremor of the beast that bears them’ (38). The machine  grants an affective response opposed to the helpless awe they experience  when seeing the moon crack: ‘[a] kind of lofty elation’ and ‘a sense  of triumphant power that lifted him far above any human concern’  (33). This allows foster to transcend his ego and attain ‘the supreme  tranquility of a god [...] it was sublime, awful nirvana. He had forgotten  even June’ (33). This alternative to cosmic horror, which draws from  the Kantian sublime’s intellectual transcendence over a dynamic  nature, means that humankind can now begin to occupy a position  of dominance in relation to nature. foster’s recognition of humanity’s  dependence on the planets, each with an existence independent of  humankind, implies a moral dimension suggestive of obligation towards,  and an opportunity to achieve hyperseparation from, nature: ‘[y]ou’re  alive, all of you. We owe our lives to you – we’ve been parasites on  your kind. But we aren’t any longer. We’re beginning all over again,  on our own’ (38). </page> <page sequence="33"> 50 Terraforming meeting this obligation coincides with the promise of a new, utopian  society represented by the crew of the Planet, ‘[s]ix hundred picked men,  representing every race and every craft and every creed, with their wives  and children. Two thousand all told – and the very cream of humanity’  (Williamson, 1934, 22). There are problems with this basis for a new  humanity that are especially evident when its members are contrasted  to the orientalised eastern sect opposing them, members of which are  described as ‘yellow-visaged demons armed with the weapons of a secret  science’ (28). The sentence’s syntax invests only the six hundred men,  not their wives (the only women aboard) or children, with the power  to represent humanity’s diversity. in addition, the selection process is  suspiciously elided. The sect’s manipulation of human fears during the  tremors presaging earth’s traumatic cracking allows them to muster an  army to confront and kill the colonists. Their deaths further elevate  foster and June’s personal relationship. Laurence manning’s ‘The Living galaxy’ (1934) prefigures Stapledon’s  extension of the living world trope to galactic scales, offering a series  of macrocosmic levels for the colonial extension of earthbound life  throughout cosmological nature. The central story is narrated as a history  lesson for a child of the far future and relates with some uncertainty an  explorer’s encounter with a potentially living galaxy, along with contex- tualising information about a now ancient and mysterious earth. an  initial frame narrator contemporaneous with the implied reader begins  with an apology and a request: ‘[i]t is impossible for me, as author,  to write their story so that it is complete in itself; i must ask you, as  reader, to lend a hand to the work’ (manning, 1934, 437). This device  calls on the reader to imaginatively assume the identity of a child at a  history lesson in the far future while engaging a critical stance towards  the events related during the second frame narrative of the history  lesson. The narrative’s discussion of colonial expansion throughout the  galaxy, which foster anticipates with wonder in ‘Born of the Sun,’ is  destabilised by positioning the second frame in the far future. a space is  thus introduced to reflect on the past, contributing to the irony directed  to notions of technological progress. manning’s awareness of ecology, demonstrated a year earlier in ‘The  man Who awoke,’ informs principles central to the technical aspects of  terraforming in ‘The Living galaxy.’ The narrator observes that earth  ‘possessed by nature a climate and an atmosphere suitable to human  existence without any artificial aide’ and ‘was deserted by thousands  of explorers who settled down on the five remaining planets of the  solar system. These were not habitable without artificial air and heat’  (manning, 1934, 438). manning’s interest in planetary environments and  </page> <page sequence="34"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 51 his knowledge of ecological issues stem from his interest in space coloni- sation and his involvement in pioneering early space rocketry. He was  one of the founding members of the american interplanetary Society,  which changed its name to the american rocket Society and merged,  in 1963, with the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics  (aiaa). as the editor of the american interplanetary Society’s journal  Astronautics, manning was well informed with regard to the technical  aspects of spaceflight and the maintenance of contained environments.  in the mid-1940s manning retired from the organisation, an event that  coincided with a shift towards the professionalisation and legitimation  of rocket science as a field for scientific and technical enquiry. manning  also wrote The How and Why of Better Gardening (1951), from which could  be inferred a link between spaceflight and garden landscapes. in ‘The Living galaxy,’ early terraforming themes are connected  to the colonisation of space, which, as in Williamson’s story, is  reliant on technology for realisation. Colonisation is seen as a case of  ‘steady, peaceful expansion’ made possible by ‘two great inventions’  and cosmological geography: the release of atomic power and atomic  synthesis (anticipating Williamson’s CT stories), and the abundant  space and resources available throughout the galaxy (manning, 1934,  438). This latter idea alludes to histories of the colonial acquisition of  resources and territories, a relation that is strengthened by the pedagogic  narrative frame. However, the initial narrative device, by highlighting  the textuality and uncertainty of the fictional historical events, engages  the implied reader in an ironic unmasking of the official story, thus  calling into question notions of colonial expansion. Bzonn’s encounter with what he believes is ‘a gigantic creature rooting  dangerously with a tentacle among the stars that housed the human  race’ shows that despite this ideology of peaceful expansion, a meeting  with nature’s alien otherness provokes a violent reaction (manning,  1934, 442). The narrator, whose authority is already compromised by  his temporal distance from these events, asserts that ‘[i]t must be borne  in mind that Bzonn felt no doubt that the star-mass composed a living  intelligent creature’ (442). The teacher’s professional scepticism leads  him to consider various opposing theories, but the structure of the  narrative manipulates the reader into support for Bzonn’s theory that  ‘the protuberance was a creature of life in some form which utilized  solar systems after the fashion of atoms’ (441). Bzonn’s destruction of  the galaxy in perceived self-defence means that certainty can never be  attained, much to the implied detriment of humanity. The story’s ‘afterword’ sees the return of the initial frame narrator  but is narrated in second person, towards an implied reader who retains  </page> <page sequence="35"> 52 Terraforming their imaginative assumption of the schoolchild’s identity. This device  constructs a complex set of relations between colonial expansion and  a child’s curiosity and wonder towards grand historical events, which  introduces a subtext that is critical of expansionist ideology. The narrator  conflates the supposed ideological position of the implied reader and  this member of the far future when describing how ‘[y]ou are one of  those who cannot wait for the next day to bring what it will – you must  peer into the next chapter, driven by curiosity. for long hours you sit  there over the book and i would give anything to know what you read  there!’ (manning, 1934, 497). The frame narrator, implied reader and  child of the far future all have a stake in the knowledge and wonder  of the future, and yet this intergalactic imperialism is undercut, thus  placing this story in opposition to the faith in scientific rationalism and  technology evident in Williamson’s ‘Born of the Sun.’ This discussion highlights a link between early terraforming,  ecological catastrophe and proto-gaian narratives, namely an asymmetry  that Yanarella identifies as a ‘profound indifference’ towards the fate of  individual species, a characteristic that he sees as implicit in the gaia  hypothesis (2001, 227). Lovecraft describes the fear of the unknown as  productive of cosmic horror, an experience that, like Promethean fear,  fundamentally encodes an awareness of the asymmetric relationship  between the human and non-human (2009b [1927]). Short stories  such as ‘The Colour out of Space’ (2009c, [1927]), ‘The Dreams in  the Witch House’ (2009d, [1933]) and ‘at the mountains of madness’  (2009a, [1936]) present cosmic horror in relation to aspects of a  previously unsuspected cosmological nature. The echoes of Shiel’s text in  Hamilton’s treatment of the living world and their use of cosmic horror  further support the case for the dialogic exploration of proto-gaian  themes in scientific romance and early pulp sf. Proto-gaian themes are  connected to journeys of discovery, a structure that opposes known  and unknown spaces as an emblem for scientific discovery, itself a  method of landscaping nature’s otherness. Williamson’s text offers the  technological sublime as a counter to the sense of human insignif- icance in the face of an awe-inspiring cosmos, whereas the discovery  of the proto-gaian entity in other stories challenges the capacity for  scientific enquiry and colonial projects of acquisition and mastery to  erase nature’s otherness. </page> <page sequence="36"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 53 The Decline of the Living World Motif  in 1950s American Pulp Sf as has been shown, terraforming and living world stories offer fertile  spaces for enviro-ethical reflection. The relationship between nature’s  otherness and the theme of interconnectedness, a significant aspect of  the gaian texts influenced by Lovelock’s hypothesis, has already been  anticipated by episodes in which the line between human and non-human  nature is blurred, as in The Purple Cloud and ‘The earth-Brain.’ few living  world stories appear in the 1940s–1950s, a period overlapping with the  development of the first phase of narratives that make terraforming  their focus. The living world narrative sporadically resurfaces during  the postwar period, with the result that the motif becomes situated  ever-more firmly in the american pulp sf tradition. murray Leinster’s ‘The Lonely Planet’ (1949) is one of few living  world short stories published after Star Maker and before the expansion  of the american environmental movement in the 1960s. The living world  in this story is set against an interplanetary background, geography  already touched on in Stapledon’s and manning’s work. Through an  alien planetary consciousness, Leinster continues his exploration of  human–alien contact famously handled in his short story ‘first Contact’  (2004 [1945]). The living world is relocated from the planet’s core to its  surface. Christened alyx by the first expedition to discover the planet,  the creature is a single living organism that develops consciousness  after exposure to humankind. at first its compliance with men’s wishes  makes it ‘a living, self-supporting robot, an abject servant to any creature  with purpose it encounters,’ and it is exploited for its labour in mining  the valuable rotenite in its crust (Leinster, 1949, 83). This focus on the  exploitation of natural resources aligns this story with Doyle’s ‘When the  World Screamed’ and the instrumental relationship to nature signified  by the motif of the drill. When the alyx Corporation discovers that the planet’s scientific  and technological progress has outstripped humanity’s, their economic  interest in alyx leads them to the view that ‘[t]he idea of a greater- than-human intelligence [...] [is] frightening. if it became known, the  results would be deplorable’ (Leinster, 1949, 85). They decide that ‘alyx  had to be killed,’ because ‘[i]t was wiser than men. it could do things  men could not do. To be sure, it had served mankind for five hundred  years’ (90). alyx is capable of developing technology incomprehensible  to humanity, but the humans’ fear leads them to reject opportunities  to establish a mutually beneficial relationship. alyx offers to create a  utopia for humankind on its surface, yet, except for a few descended  </page> <page sequence="37"> 54 Terraforming from the explorer who originally identified alyx as sentient, it is refused.  recalling the orientalised cults in Williamson’s ‘Born of the Sun,’ the  narrator records how ‘[c]ults, too, sprang up to point out severally that  alyx was the soul-mother of the universe and must be worshiped; that  it was the incarnation of the spirit of evil and must be defied; that it  was the predestined destroyer of mankind and must not be resisted’  (Leinster, 1949, 94). These responses are indicative of attempts to  explain in religious terms threatening cosmic events, thus connecting  the societal confusion caused by a confrontation with nature’s otherness  to the dialogic aspect of sf, here represented as a thematic element  of the text. Several groups adhering to diverging positions speak for  alyx, thus demonstrating attempts to incorporate the living planet  into humankind’s intellectual landscapes to downplay its radical alien  otherness. in contrast to the dangerous relationship that the living world  poses to humankind in many of the stories discussed above, Leinster  portrays the living world in a manner resonant with fearn’s depiction  of the alien scientists in ‘earth’s mausoleum.’ The benefits that alyx  offers are refused because of limitations in humankind’s ability to accept  an asymmetry between itself and nature, which generates Promethean  fear and leads to its attempt to gain mastery over the living world  through force. These works offer textual sites for philosophical reflection and are  entangled with other treatments and themes as part of the megatextual  dialogue of sf. nature’s otherness, a concept designating the relationship  of non-human nature to human nature and culture, is understood  in cosmological terms in the scientific romances, early cosmic pulp sf  and postwar pulp sf dealing with terraforming, geoengineering and  living worlds. The thematic prevalence of resource extraction in these  proto-gaian texts links them to notions of terragouging, the terrafor- mation of a planet ‘to facilitate extraction of raw materials for earthly  consumption’ (murphy, 2001, 270). The drill signifies humankind’s  exploitative relationship to nature, functioning as a metonymy for a  civilisation that homogenises and landscapes it in terms that oscillate  between monstrosity and motherliness. These proto-gaian narratives  disrespect nature’s otherness, but include interstices through which  recognition of radical otherness enters the text as one voice among  others. Lee’s asymmetry, autonomy and no-Teleology Theses help identify  the fundamental environmental attitudes that structure human relations  to nature’s otherness. Promethean fear, grounded in the axiomatic  asymmetry between humankind and nature, is evident in the scientific  romances of Shiel and Wells and in the cosmic sf of Hamilton,  </page> <page sequence="38"> LanDSCaPing naTUre’S oTHerneSS 55 Williamson, manning and Leinster. Such responses are imagined as  leading towards an urge to direct humankind’s environments and  history via technocratic societal management, as in The Shape of Things  to Come, or through various technological fixes such as the contained  spaceship/habitat in ‘Born of the Sun.’ When the asymmetry Thesis  is undermined in cosmic sf, Promethean fear is overturned and  technology appears to elevate humanity above nature, allowing it to  exploit and control the cosmos. manning’s ‘The Living galaxy’ ironises  this development and, along with Stapledon’s Star Maker, challenges the  colonial anthropomorphism of the war on nature theme that informs  terraforming and living world stories by offering vectors for recognising  nature’s otherness. This chapter has shown how terraforming and proto-gaian themes  were used to explore civilisation’s disrespect of nature’s otherness in  works published during the interwar period. The next chapter explores  how terraforming was framed in terms of the american pastoral in the  american pulp sf of the 1950s–1960s. </page> </plain_text>
