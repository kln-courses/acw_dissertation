<plain_text><page sequence="1">discussions, there is finally a stress on the importance of operating funds. The tempta- tion has always been to support programs- visible, glamorous, specific -while the crunch has been most strongly felt in the day- to-day operating costs. In effect, the attrac- tive accessories have masked the dirty linen. The report may be of value in rationalizing a higher level of government support-on all levels -and in stimulating increased funding from business and industry. These may be aided by two further research reports, both commissioned from the National Research Center of the Arts (an affiliate of the Lou Harris organization) that are scheduled for publication shortly. One documents a very positive attitude toward the arts, so positive that a "majority . . . would be willing to pay increased taxes" for support of the arts; the other deals with the "essential service budget," or the amount of money needed to "properly utilize" the full existing resources of arts organizations. Now or forever? Still, the problem of how to pay continues to be paramount. Two different approaches have recently been chosen by the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of De- sign, and the Indianapolis Museum. The Rhode Island museum recently inaugurated its first annual giving program, with a goal of $112,164 (splendidly specific) to underwrite museum-operating expenses. This is the first time that the museum has been able to mount a fund drive independent of the School and specifically for the benefit of the museum. The drive was auspiciously inaugurated by the distinguished director of another mu- seum: J. Carter Brown of the National Gal- lery. Carter, a loyal native son, gave a witty and rousing keynote address that highlighted both the museum's needs and its excellence. In contrast, Indianapolis, which has been very successful in raising operating funds by annual gifts, seems to have concluded that endowment is the key factor. Because a mere 3% of the current annual budget is funded with endowment income, a $30 million capital fund drive has been inaugurated, to run through 1983. The board hopes that the en- dowment raised will produce an annual in- come of $1.5 million-about three-fourths of the museum's annual budget. The drive is well-seeded, with a matching challenge grant from the Krannert Charitable Trust of up to $5 million and a recent history of a $1 million annual challenge grant from the Lilly En- dowment. Wear a white hat: A recent San Antonio fed- eral case, U.S. vs. Simpson, raises the possi- bility that anyone who receives or transports through interstate commerce pre-Columbian Mexican artifacts may be liable to criminal penalties. Although an appeal is pending in the case, the questions raised apply not only to sale and purchase, but also to the inter- state circulation of pre-Columbian materi- als-as, for example, in the traveling of loan shows. Of course, not only the laws them- selves, but also many of the definitions are fuzzy and ambiguous, but any object that can- not be proven to have been exported from Mexico more than 75 years ago may be in- cluded in this most recent legal definition. exhibitions A family affair: The first major American retrospective exhibition of the work of Jac- ques Villon opened in mid-January at the Fogg Museum of Harvard and traveled to the Neuberger Museum at S.U.N.Y., Purchase, where it remains through May 23rd. Orga- nized by a team of six Harvard graduate stu- dents under the direction of Daniel Robbins, the show contains almost 170 works, half of them prints and drawings. The show exam- ines Villon's development from an illustrator for humorous magazines to a master graphic artist and, finally, to a painter whose re- served emphasis on structure and idea has always set him apart from his contemporar- ies. For Americans, who are familiar especially with the accomplishments of Marcel Du- champ, the catalogue-a full-scale examina- tion of the artist's life and work - may be most interesting for the illuminating relationships demonstrated among the three brothers: Mar- cel, Jacques, and Raymond. Apparently Jac- ques was the center of a private visual dia- logue maintained by the brothers in their work. Careful attention has been given to the theories of color and form construction devel- oped and practiced by Jacques, setting these into the context of Cubist and post-Cubist painting. A refined and logical painter, Vil- lon reserved abstract painting for the expres- sion of his most complex ideas, and his vision was as broad as his techniques were varied. The French have for some decades considered Jacques the greatest of the three brothers, but this is the first time we have seen enough evidence to justify their judgment. Weighted with iron: A major exhibition of Art Nouveau, organized by the Institute for the Arts, Rice University, and the Art Institute of Chicago will be installed at the Houston cam- pus this spring (Mar. 25-June 27) and in the Chicago museum during the early fall (Aug. 28-Nov. 7). The exhibition consists of about 700 pieces of Art Nouveau, featuring some 120 iron architectural works by Guimard that are being exhibited for the first time in the United States. In addition to the iron works will be paintings, sculpture, architecture, furniture, ceramics, glassware, illustrated books and bookbindings, jewelry, fabrics, and other types of items exemplifying the style. Jacques Villon, Head of a Woman, 1914, in the Villon Retrospective at SUNY, Purchase. Focusing on stylistic developments in France and Belgium at the turn of the century, the show has borrowed works from museums and private collections in those countries, as well as from England, Switzerland, Germany, and the United States. The fully illustrated cata- logue planned to accompany the show will include essays by several European scholars on a variety of topics, among which are Bing's "L'Art Nouveau," the role of the Universal Exhibitions in the diffusion of style, posters, and others. Boston photographers: The daguerreotypes of Albert Sands Southworth and Josiah John- son Hawes are being presented in a major bicentennial exhibition of more than 110 works at the International Museum of Pho- tography, Rochester. The studio of South- worth and Hawes was the most prestigious photographic portrait parlor in America dur- ing the middle of the 19th century (1843- 1861). According to Robert A. Sobieszek, asso- ciate curator of 19th-century photography, who along with Odette M. Appel, research assistant, selected and organized the show, the work of Southworth and Hawes is "the quintessential product of the American da- guerreian age." Since the technique was a direct positive process without a negative, each daguerreotype image is a unique histori- cal artifact. The exhibition will present a retrospective look at the work of these two Boston pioneers as well as the personalities who "sat" for them: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wads- worth Longfellow, Daniel Webster, Lola Montez, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and others. Although most noted for its large portraits, the studio also produced landscapes and har- bor views. After leaving Rochester on June 8th, the show will travel to the National Por- trait Gallery in Washington and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Preparation of both SPRING 1976 271</page><page sequence="2">the exhibition and its catalogue was assisted by a grant from the N.E.A. Shots by Women: Earlier this season the Vas- sar College Art Gallery installed, in conjunc- tion with International Women's Year, an ex- hibit of photographs by women. Comprised of 35 prints by 15 photographers, the earliest works in the exhibit were by Julia Margaret Cameron. Among others were examples by Imogen Cunningham, Margaret Bourke White, Berenice Abbott, Dorothea Lange, Frances Benjamin Johnston, Diane Arbus, Alisa Wells, Athena Tacha, Bea Nettles, Betty Hahn, Gertrude Kasebier, and Helen Levitt. According to some critics, women have played a greater role in the history of photography than in any other pictorial me- dium. At Dartmouth's Hopkins Center, one of the major spring shows will be an exhibition of Polaroid works by Marie Cosindis (through Apr. 4th). Cosindis has been in residence at the Hanover campus as part of Dartmouth's Artist-in-Residence program. Photo-friendship: Another earlier exhibition was mounted this fall by the Smart Gallery of the University of Chicago. More than 60 pho- tographs in Aaron Siskind's series dedicated to Franz Kline, a close friend, were created from 1972-1975. Their actual subject matter is walls with anonymously painted images and signs. Siskind found these images in Jalapa (Mexico), Rome, and Lima. The evocation in the resulting photographs of Kline's style and of the relationship between the two men is a testament to the friendship and to Siskind's interest in abstract photography. In addition to the photographs, the show also included several paintings by Kline. Photo-Processes: An exhibition of 90 works by 29 contemporary artists was mounted this winter by Rutgers University. Representing a broad range of styles, the artists were united Aaron Siskind, Rome, 150, a 1973 photograph from the University of Chicago's exhibition of Siskind prints in Homage to Franz Kline. by their use of some process or other from photography, hence the show's title Photo- graphic Process as Medium. Organized by Ro- sanne Livingston, a doctoral candidate at Rutgers and assistant to the director of the University Art Gallery, supported by a grant from the N.E.A., the show explored works that resulted from procedures of photographic origin but used these processes in non-tradi- tional or updated ways. We have all been aware of the growing significance of photog- raphy in contemporary art and in the increas- ingly blurred lines separating paintings from prints from sculpture, and even from photo- graphs themselves; but the breadth of appli- cations possible has remained relatively ig- nored. We remember seeing the first group of those remarkable Samaras color Polaroid "paintings," in which the artist manipulates the still fluid color layers of the film after exposure to produce a unique work, and mar- veling at the incredible control of techniques, both painterly and photographic. Along with artists who, like Samaras, utilize the newest photographic advances as their medium, are six who work in holography and others who have adapted the camera obscura and the photogram to their contemporary interests. Many of the artists in this show have not been exhibited widely, while a few, especially su- perstar Warhol, are virtually household words. A 40-page illustrated catalogue accom- panies the exhibition. Teaching artist: Scripps College's Golden An- niversary Exhibition (Mar. 26-April 29) hon- ors Millard Sheets, an artist who was a pro- fessor at Scripps for 16 years. Emphasizing Sheets' large design commissions, the show will include mosaics, murals, and prepara- tory studies. It will also, however, be a gen- eral retrospective of the artist's work. Paper works: California State University, Long Beach, will mount a spring show of modern and contemporary works of art on paper from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Leon Lyon. Ranging from Klimt and Rodin to Vija Celmins and Lita Albuquerque, the show also includes works by Sam Francis, Dieben- korn, Ellsworth Kelly, Jim Dine, Rosenquist, and John Altoon, among others. The Lyon collection, from Southern California, is not widely known and should be of considerable interest. No ivory tower: More and more university art departments have established relationships with neighboring public, or non-academic, museums, but few have been as active as the faculty of Emory University at the High Mu- seum of Art in Atlanta. Clark Poling has organized two current shows for the High: Bauhaus Color, now circulating to Houston and San Diego; and Contemporary Art in At- lanta Collections, opening in April. John Howett is chairman of an outdoor sculpture exhibition, part of the city's bicentennial cele- Jonn tanvara, elir 'orrrair, Trom me Mlnnesola Bicentennial exhibition, most of which will tour the state from April through December. (Owned by the University Gallery, University of Minne- sota.) bration, which will exhibit contemporary monumental works; and he also organized a contemporary show, The New Image, which continues at the High through June 27th. Although largely contemporary, The New Im- age also includes examples of earlier works meant to aid the viewer in "focusing upon the structural and conceptual relationships be- tween art forms of today and similar forms in history." The groups of "images" into which the show is divided (which are not meant to "be imprisoned" in their categories) are: envi- ronmental; serial/modular; descriptive; as- sembled; kinetic; conceptual; object; and chance. The show has a modest, but admira- ble, 16-page newspaper-catalogue as docu- mentation. Less visible, but of equal interest, is the recently published bicentennial cata- logue of American paintings in the collections of The High Museum, a catalogue prepared by Emory's Bruce Chambers. Late Hunt: The University of Maryland Art Gallery organized an exhibition of the works of William Morris Hunt, with special empha- sis on the late landscapes of the 1870s. Al- though already closed in College Park, the show is currently installed at the Albany In- stitute of History and Art, where it remains through April 25th. A fully illustrated cata- logue by Marshal E. Landgren accompanies the show and a chronology of Hunt's life and work has been prepared by Sharman Mc- Gurn, a graduate student at the University.

Perhaps because sculpture has once again begun to assume the traditional propor- tions, if not the traditional form, of the monu- mental, our interest has become strength- ened, fostering investigation of the media itself, its differences, and the special qualities that must influence response and under- standing. Surely the most remarkable and stimulat- ing of these catalogues is Metamorphoses in Nineteenth-Century Sculpture, edited by Jeanne L. Wasserman for the Fogg Art Mu- seum, 300 pages, 282 plates, $35 hard cover from the Harvard University Press. Although the catalogue for a loan exhibition of some 100 objects by six sculptors, this book is also an indispensable examination of the many prob- lems raised by "serial sculpture" and is an attempt to sort out the relationships among different casts of the same piece. The ques- tions surrounding authenticity, individual- ity, uniqueness, or the relationship of the artist to a cast are, of course, laden with economic implications. The collector hoping for a growth investment, as well as pleasure, would do well to study these several essays - especially Jacques de Caso's and Arthur Beale's. Even more important to the disinter- ested observer, however, is the book's consist- ent emphasis on the aesthetic and historical, rather than economic, consequences of multi- ple production, size variation, and technical innovations. The problems of patronage and ambition (the almost universal desire to cre- ate monuments and the insufficient market for monuments that plagued several genera- tions of sculptors from Houdon through La- chaise and Nadelman in our own century) are more than casually raised and will almost certainly be treated more extensively in fu- ture publications by de Caso. There is much material on the early French legal defini- tions, myriad cases involving contracts, the rights of a foundry, of an artist, the use of signatures in cast work, of scale alteration. Much of this material is in footnotes (those to de Caso's essay, in French, are particularly illuminating), but is satisfying in its extent, and extraordinary in the details of attitudes that are not merely documented but closely examined. From intentions to techniques, from model to mold to cast to patina, every aspect of a work is examined, discussed, and situated in the history of related pieces. The six artists discussed-Houdon, Barye, Car- peaux, Rodin, Saint-Gaudens, and French- are each represented by a broad serial range of merely one or two subjects. From the coop- erative study of the serial works by a group of art historians and technical experts a clear methodology emerges, a method applicable to areas far larger than that encompassed by this book. Contributors include H. H. Arna- son, Glen F. Benge, Annie Braunwald, Anne Middleton Wagner, Patricia Sanders, John Dryfhout, and Michael Richmond, in addition to Wasserman, de Caso, and Beale. This book is not a comprehensive definitive study on sculpture multiples, but it is the most com- prehensive to date and will long be the ground-breaking study on which future work will build. SPRING 1976 273</page><page sequence="4">Artist and Fabricator, catalogue of an exhibi- tion organized by Hugh Marlais Davies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (illus- trations, statements, interviews, 60 pages, $4), raises some of the same questions as Met- amorphoses but in relation to contemporary sculpture. Although the catalogue includes some paper works, the sculptural works in this show are unified to the extent that they were all fabricated by Lippincott, Inc., the North Haven "sculpture factory." In a brief historical summary, Davies traces the origins of"fabricated" sculpture to Tony Smith in the early '60s and the impersonal emphasis that blew in with the wind of Minimalism. Founded to provide "both a fully equipped factory and financial support" for realization of monumental sculpture, Lippincott has in many cases resulted in a cooperative func- tioning of artists and technicians, not unlike the relationships that existed in the best of the 19th-century foundries or in contempo- rary print establishments like Tatiana Gross- man's. The differences of type that develop in the working relationships of artist-in-factory are the fascinating meat of the catalogue, from the mechanical blow-up possible from the technically perfected models of some sculptors to the spontaneous creative energy of Louise Nevelson. The artists' statements have unusual applicability to the subject of the catalogue, and the interviews, particu- larly that with Roxanne Everett, provide un- expected insights into the sculptors, both as craftsmen and as personalities. Artists in- cluded are Clement Meadmore, James Rosati, Oldenburg, Nevelson, Sugarman, Robert Murray, Lucas Samaras, Ellsworth Kelly, and David Von Schlegell. Traditions and Revisions, Themes from the History of Sculpture, by Gabriel P. Weisberg, Introduction by H. W. Janson (119 entries, fully illustrated, 144 pages) is the catalogue of an exhibition for the Cleveland Museum. If we accept director Sherman Lee's contention (via Baudelaire) that sculpture has been his- torically "boring" to a wide public, then we accept this catalogue as a successful attempt to refresh and revitalize sculptural works from a variety of cultures. It does so by taking them out of their cultural-historical context to be seen as an independent art form in new cross-cultural relationships. The fact that certain types of subjects emerge in various cultures can, at least superficially, argue for the universality of themes. Janson, however, wants us to look at sculpture for the qualities that set it apart from the other visual arts. Tracing the fluctuating societal view of sculp- ture and sculptors through history, and the strictures placed on sculpture by patronage Louise Nevelson, Voyage, from the exhibition and catalogue Artist and Fabricator. and the "ruinously high investment" in mate- rials required for a sculptor's independence, Janson argues for a greater degree of autono- mous development for sculpture than histo- rians traditionally allow. And, in reply to Baudelaire's arguments he claims that sculp- ture can communicate more successfully than its more illusionistic or functional relatives. All of the works, many unfamiliar, are in the collections of the Cleveland Museum, and the quality of photography and reproduction is certainly high enough for visual pleasure and interest. With its unusual juxtapositions, this is a reader's book, depending more on the viewer than on the authors for insights and new ideas. But that was the purpose of both exhibition and catalogue. Aspects of 19th-Century Sculpture, by six Case Western Reserve graduate students un- der the supervision of H. W. Janson, (47 an- notated entries, 27 illustrations, no bibliog- raphy, 32 pages) is the catalogue of a loan exhibition at the Cleveland Museum. In his introduction, Janson stresses the difficulties of being objective about the 19th century be- cause of the continuous influence it still ex- erts on "the political and social framework of our lives." Being neither past nor present, we tend to look to it for reinforcement, judging its products according to our own goals and interests rather than on their terms, an atti- tude that he feels has led to the neglect of 19th-century sculpture even more than of painting and architecture. The six "aspects" treated are: The Animaliers; Sculpture and Politics; Images of Womanhood; The Bust Portrait and the Partial Figure; Dalou and the Baroque Revival; and Italy: Classics, Ro- mantics, and Realists (actually Canova, Monti, and Gemito). With six authors in- volved the six sections are not of equal insight and interest. We thought The Bust Portrait ... most apt, especially since it dealt with some of the ideas skimped in Sculpture and Politics; it was also less heavily weighted to the late century than other aspects. Both of these catalogues stem from the Cleveland Museum's joint program with Case Western Reserve and from the program's 1975 empha- sis on sculpture. Masterworks in Modern Sculpture from the Collection of Ben C. Deane, catalogue of an exhibition organized by the Fine Arts Galler- ies, California State University, Long Beach, (16 entries, 20 plates, 3 text pages, presented in loose-sheet portfolio format) is interesting if seen in the context of questions raised by the preceding catalogues. Constance Glenn, in her Preface, hails Rodin as "the father of modern sculpture," Henry Moore as "the father of contemporary sculpture," and the collection as composed of masterworks, each of which "alters the character, or expands the boundaries ... of that which is to follow." There are lush reproductions of works by Ro- din (6 of the 7 being Mus6e Rodin casts), Bour- delle, Maillol, Renoir, Lipchitz, Moore, Manzu, and Zuniga. ART JOURNAL, XXXV/3 274</page><page sequence="5">Oldenburg, Six Themes, catalogue of an exhi- bition for the Walker Art Center (installed in the Art Gallery of Toronto Apr. 4-May llth), by Martin Friedman (250 works, 130 ill., bib- liography, interviews, 100 pages) is a bargain at $6.95. The six themes-geometric mouse; three-way plug; fagends; clothespin; type- writer eraser; and standing mitt with ball- are each illustrated in hard and soft, large and small, sketch and sculpture. Ranging from 1959 to 1975, the variety of material illustrates the importance of process in Old- enburg's work and is supplemented not only by Friedman's sensitive introduction but also by interviews on each theme with the sculp- tor. The verbal wit, intelligent transforma- tions, unexpected juxtapositions that emerge are valuable adjuncts to the visible art. Vis- ual coincidences become a sort of witty intel- lectual formalism, iconography becomes a magical investment of symbol (Mickey Mouse becoming Mental Mouse), and visual puns expand to mythic unities. It is fascinating and rewarding to establish a connection, as Fried- man does, between Oldenburg's interest in Master Drawings and his soft sculptures. This rich catalogue is entertaining, amusing, and a significant contribution not only to the literature on Oldenburg but also to an under- standing of contemporary art. ChristolOceanfront, by Sally Yard, Introduc- tion by Sam Hunter, published in conjunction with an exhibition at the Art Museum, Prince- ton (84 pages, many illustrations) is, in its way, a work of art. Since documentation is recognized as a vital element of Christo's enormous projects, and since the exhibition it catalogues was itself the documentation of a project constructed for one week as part of the 1974 outdoor Newport exhibition Monumenta, it is the documentation of the documenta- tion. ... The various texts are informative and the photographs, like the project, are breathtaking. Christo's genius is that even in reality his work remains a concept, with even the immense amount of organized human labor involved as concept. In his scale, indi- vidual error is generously absorbed by an awesome totality. This publication is not so broadly informative or appealing as the Oldenburg catalogue, but it shows Christo at his best, and that doesn't leave room for much meaningful intervention! Clarence Schmidt, by Gregg Blasdel and Wil- liam C. Lipke, published in conjunction with a traveling exhibition organized by the Flem- ing Museum, University of Vermont (112 pages, heavily illustrated) is, in its peculiar sort of way, a similar sort of documentation, but of one strange "grass roots" microcosm. We confess that Schmidt is not our personal cup of tea, mainly because he seems almost too self-consciously "with" both the acid cul- ture and the neo-Dada boom of the early '60s. (If the avant-garde of that decade "was aca- demic" vis-a-vis naive art, academic may well have been merely misused to explain a degree of discrimination and discipline; and naive allowed to become far more sophisticated.) Be that as it may, this publication, attractive and intelligently produced, should be of inter- est, use, and possibly pleasure to anyone con- cerned with grass roots art, folk environ- ments, primitivistic expression, or any other name this sort of consuming, individualized creative force goes under. Lipke's essay sheds considerable light on the contemporary criti- cal acclaim bestowed on Schmidt and the var- ied reasons for it. Autobiography of Alan Sonfist, a self-presen- tation by the artist, introduction by Lawrence Alloway, published in connection with an ex- hibition at Cornell University (unpaginated, many illustrations), although purporting to be a look at the artist is even more a personal look at the world. This portrait of the artist- in-nature (or nature-in-artist), verbal as well as visual, is the opposite of Clarence Schmidt's accretionary world. Every image, every word is the result of conscious choice, of a purifying process, and of aesthetic - though often startling- control. Jacob Epstein, catalogue of an exhibition or- ganized by faculty and students in the gradu- ate program in museum training of Syracuse University, preface and introduction by Stan- ton L. Catlin (24 pages, 50 entries, many il- lustrated) ranges from early works (1902-04) through late (1957). Fitting the more tradi- tional aspects of its subject, it is a traditional and straightforward catalogue. The summer issue of the Art Journal will describe the coming spate of American bicen- tennial catalogues. Early entries of interest include the following: Benjamin Franklin, A Perspective, by Louise Todd Ambler, Introduction by I. Bernard Cohen, catalogue of an exhibition at the Fogg Museum, Harvard, 148 pages, 88 entries, mostly annotated. Assembled largely from Harvard's various collections, this assembly of Frankliniana is fascinating and broader than one might expect, coming from a single source. The breadth of Franklin's talents and interests were marvelous, and almost all are represented and therefore discussed in this publication. Although the objects themselves may be-indeed are-interesting, the main subject is, of course, the man. The pleasant text is both graceful and informative, al- though it is the assembly rather than any myth-shattering new discoveries that holds our interest. The Colonial Epoch in America, catalogue of an exhibition at the Worcester Art Museum, by Dagmar E. Reutlinger, 79 pages, 102 illus- trations, $4.50. Almost exclusively drawn from Worcester's own collections, the cata- logue ranges from paintings through coins, covering many of the useful and decorative arts (including architectural photographs and gravestone rubbings) along the way. The run- ning text provides apt comments and helpful information not only on the specific objects but on types of objects and social conditions as well. Few museum collections could do so well on their own, but Worcester's early pieces are extraordinarily fine, and not all are so often published as the delightful Mrs. Freake and Baby Mary. Young America, a selection of paintings from the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy, catalogue of a traveling exhibition, by Louise W. Iippincott and Richard J. Boyle, Preface by John McCoubrey, 79 pages, 48 entries, fully illustrated. Masterpieces from the great American academy, stronger in the last cen- tury, perhaps, than in the present, but more than adequate in both. Incidentally, our country is still young, hence the inclusion of Diebenkorn and Andrew Wyeth. All of the artists were part of the Academy at one time or another, and the degree to which the Acad- emy contained both mainstream and revolu- tion is its glory. John George Brown, 1831-1913, A Reap- praisal, catalogue by graduate students Philip Grime and Catherine Mazza for the Fleming Museum, University of Vermont, unpaginated, 18 entries, illustrated. This cat- alogue succeeds in extending a sympathetic hand to the sentimental painter of urban an- ecdote. The sympathy is based on the taste of his time and a requirement, not unjustified, that we understand the artist's intentions and ambitions. To test him by the goals of a Ho- mer (as many have) is to overlook the true merit of his work. The Heritage of American Art, catalogue of an exhibition organized by the Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art and the American Federation of Arts, by Mary Davis, introductory essay by John K. Howat and Natalie Spassky, 238 pages, 100 fully illustrated and annotated en- tries, bibliographies, and biographies. This lush volume-lots of color, plenty of well-de- signed white space-is a sort of mini-history of American painting, from Smibert to Rock- well Kent. Most of the well-known paintings are too great to be called old chestnuts, and the less-known ones too good to be called sec- ondary. Despite the large plates, the text is similarly too informative and useful to justify calling it a picture book. All-in-all, a satisfy- ing bicentennial production that would be es- pecially useful on a shelf rather weak in American material. American Painters of the Impressionist Period Rediscovered, catalogue by Nicholas Fox We- ber for the Colby College Art Museum, fully illustrated, 104 pages, $10, and French Impressionists Influence American Artists, by several contributors, catalogue for the Lowe SPRING 1976 275</page><page sequence="6">Art Museum, Coral Gables, 96 pages, 197 en- tries, many illustrated, scarcely overlap at all. Only five of the fifty-four painters in- cluded in the Colby catalogue are also in the Lowe catalogue. The rediscovered Impres- sionists are mainly from New England and are genuine discoveries. Nicely printed and well-documented, with biographies of the all- but-unknown artists, this should be a useful addition to the literature. The French and American catalogue, treating as it does fancier and more familiar material, has a harder row to hoe-a task that is not aided by the generally mediocre reproductions, even with the use of lots of color. Trying to balance material about which relatively little is known with the often published and much- researched is futile, for the seesaw was weighted too unevenly. The influence that was the show's subject remains a rather general blur. acquisitions MM To market, to market: The Princeton Univer- sity Art Museum recently found itself the recipient of a bequest from the estate of Fow- ler McCormick. Established specifically as an endowment, the income of which will be used for acquisitions, the $2.5 million fund should send a happy director Peter Bunnell into the market. Commenting on the McCormick be- quest, Bunnell said: "This magnificent en- dowment will enable the museum to pursue an acquisition program unique in its history. Never before has the museum been able to focus on its needs and directions with the confidence which such an endowment pro- vides. Through this gift the museum will truly enter a new phase of its already distin- guished existence." In short, Princeton-like so many of its sister university collections- will no longer have to depend so substantially on alumni gifts for its major acquisitions. At even the conservative figure of 6%, the mu- seum should have more than $150,000 an- nually with which to go shopping, an enviable sum in this era of tightened budgets. McCormick, a graduate of the class of 1921, was chairman of the board of International Harvester and, together with other members of his family, was a strong supporter of the arts at Princeton, as well as other areas of the university. In 1972 he established a fund in the department to encourage and aid research efforts in the history of photography, and other McCormick gifts have supported uni- versity library and museum collections and research in the department of art and archae- ology. A new collector: Emory University, in At- lanta, Georgia, established its history of art program only in the fall of 1965. Almost im- mediately, it became apparent to the Emory faculty that their work was hampered by the lack of original works of art for student study. As William Crelly, Professor and now curator of the collection, has written: "Because of our financial limitations and what we conceived to be the special needs of our students, we made the decision to concentrate our collect- ing within the field of the graphic arts: illu- minations, drawings, and prints ... it has been possible for us not only to obtain art objects of exceptionally high quality, but works which we feel are particularly appro- priate for study and research in our field." In the spring of 1967 Emory's collection be- gan with a 1962 Picasso lithograph, and it now comprises some 300 items. In 1970 the collection was greatly enriched by the acqui- sition of a large number of drawings pur- chased from the estate of Paul Grigaut, a former curator of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Ranging from medieval illuminations to a 1974 group of assembled photographs by Jared Bark, the most recent change in policy was to acquire examples from the Far East, the first such acquisition being a woodcut by the 19th-century Japanese artist Kunichika. In between have come many excellent sheets from Italy, France, Holland, and the U.S.A. Acquisitions have been made with a "modest annual purchase fund from the university" as well as from many generous friends of the department. Obviously the collection still has a lot of growing to do, with specific gaps (cited by Crelly) such as Direr, Rembrandt, and major modern master drawings; but the even- tual goal is to build a collection of outstanding works representing all aspects of the graphic arts. It is also hoped that the department will some day be able to undertake work in the area of paper conservation. * indicates illustration africa, america, oceania BENA LULUA (Congo), Standing Female Fig- ure*, wood, 17" h., 19th c.
