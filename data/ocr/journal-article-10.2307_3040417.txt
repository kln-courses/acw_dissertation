<plain_text><page sequence="1">Matthew Arnold's " Eternal Not Ourselves . . ." No reader of Literature and Dogma or God and the Bible can fail to see that an important part of the " attempt conservative and . . . attempt religious" of Arnold's religious criticism is his considered attack on religious anthropomorphism.1 In these books written after he was fifty years of age, Arnold strongly deprecated descriptions of God as a " magnified and non-natural man," 2 "a personal First l God and the Bible: A Sequel to Literature and Dogma (London, 1906), p. xxx. 2 Literature and Dogma (New York, 1908), p. 36.

Both might be expected in one who had previously published an appreciative study of Spinoza.6 As a matter of fact, however, Mr. Kenneth Allott has shown that Arnold probably became interested in the immanentist view even before he had any first hand knowledge of Spinoza's works. As early as 1847 (when Arnold was only twenty-five), readings in Victor Cousin had guided Arnold to the Bhagavad Gita, a poem altogether likely to suggest the immanentist position.7 Here I should like to point out that Arnold's awareness of the problem of anthropo- morphism and his interest in the idea of divine immanence can be traced to a date earlier than 1847 and to previously unnoticed sources. In 1834, when Matthew Arnold was a boy of twelve, Dr. Arnold published a volume of Rugby sermons in which he takes up the prob- lem of anthropomorphism. In an essay controverting the philosophi- cal defenses of atheism, Thomas Arnold considered the danger of thinking of God as a " magnified, and non-natural man ": Our ideas of personality are so inevitably borrowed from our own nature, that when applied to God, they have a tendency, like all other positive notions respecting him, to lead to error. ..8 Dr. Arnold was therefore partly in sympathy with the attempt made by Professor Jacob Abbott to " repel the anthropomorphic notion of ' a monarch on a throne of marble and gold . . . sitting in a fancied region which we call heaven '."

Abbott (1803-1879), who attended Bowdoin with Hawthorne and taught Longfellow, was something of an intellectual force in his day. He served as Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Amherst, as a licensed Congregationalist minister, and as founder of the experimental Mt. Vernon school. In the midst of these activities he found time singly to 310 Modern Language Notes</page><page sequence="3">friend and correspondent, was the author of The Corner Stone (1834), a work of Christian evidences bitterly attacked in 1836 by John Henry Newman because of its " Socinian " tendencies.'0 In 1833 Dr. Arnold had begun a correspondence with Abbott, for whose judgment he had the greatest respect."l Nevertheless, he found himself unable fully to accept Abbott's definitions of God which are significantly antici- patory of those in Literature and Dogma: * . . the all-pervading Power, which lives and acts through the whole universe. . . . the invisible and universal Power pervading all space and existing in all time.:2 In another passage, Abbott developed a conception of a moral imma- terial deity which is close to " the Eternal, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness." 13 Thomas Arnold was not sharply critical of The Corner Stone which he called " a most excellent work," because he felt that Abbott's con- ceptions were not so much untrue as, like, other " pantheistic " doc- trines, "awkward and obscure" expressions of truth. He suggested that these were likely to lead to injurious moral effects by " removing all the analogies which might help us to conceive of our relations to God." He did not consider such doctrines as atheistical, however, but as the logical reaction against gross materialism in religion: A constitution of things favouring virtue and discouraging vice, and requiring men, as parts of the great whole, to act in conformity with it, and to support its tendencies, is little more than the strong recoil of anthropomorphism.34 According to Dr. Arnold, Abbott was right in denying traditional conceptions of God's nature but wrong in trying to substitute other positive notions of his own for those which he had attacked.'5 In other words, by 1834, Matthew Arnold's father had stated in print that he found the old anthropomorphic ways of talking about God to be unsatisfactory but that he could not fully approve of attempts write and publish 180 volumes, chiefly didactic works, which attained a wide circulation.

Newman argued that the movement of liberalism which read Abbott's work with edification would end in "god-denying Apostasy" (p. 53). '- A. P. Stanley, Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold.

There can be little doubt that the problem first came to Matthew Arnold's attention in the library at Fox How. One answer to it can be seen in Literature and Dogma: acceptance of Thomas Arnold's criticism of anthropo- morphism and acceptance of the idea of divine immanence as held by Jacob Abbott.
