<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHONY LIBBY* eeClaritasWilliam Carlos Williams' Epiphanies There is nothing so complex as Williams' early " imagist ' simplicity, and nothing so dangerously alluring to the philosophical critic. The poems require little interpretation, but invite extensive theorizing, and the most convincing theories so far constructed—including Williams' own—develop primarily through complex paradox. It seems pointless, for instance, to argue that Williams creates a completely objective vision, without exploring the ways in which it may also be completely subjective. Only through such abstractions can the critic approach this highly concrete poetry, but abstractions about Williams inevitably suggest their opposites. For this reason, and because of Williams' own semi-mystical statements (for instance his letter to Marianne Moore about the "nameless religious experience" which made him accept the world as "a part of myself"1), there is a strong critical temptation to see the poetry as operating in an essentially unlogical realm. Often it seems that Williams rejects the dualistic and analytic logic of Western thought and that his poetry, like the implicitly monistic Eastern haiku which centrally influenced the imagists, evokes trans cendental visions which are not only not paraphrasable but also not ultimately susceptible to analysis. Even J. Hillis Miller, who in Poets of Reality argues intelligently and convincingly that Williams the post-romantic creates a world without " depth or transcendence," frequently discusses Williams in mystical and implicitly transcendental terms. In Williams' poetry, Miller says, " everything becomes a unit," and " anywhere is everywhere, and all times are one time."2 This is a misinterpretation of Williams avowed intention to discover the universal in the particular; by overemphasizing the universal Miller pays insufficient attention to Williams' constant sense of the particu larity of individual things. Williams is seldom quite so far from traditional dualistic logic as Miller (and often Williams himself) sug * Assistant Professor of English at Ohio State University, Anthony Libby is currently working on modern poets and also on aspects of contemporary culture. 1 Selected Letters, ed.

If his poetry achieves the effect of revelation, it does so not through the transcendental evocativeness of the haiku, not through any breaking down of barriers between things, but through a rather surprisingly rigorous process of logical analysis. In his own unique way, Williams fits a characteristically modern pattern, but it is a pattern that develops out of traditional Western aesthetic philosophy, rather than out of a rebellion against tradition. The first clue to the nature of that pattern comes, illogically, not from analysis but from the general aura of many of The Collected Earlier Poems,3 which constantly suggests an ineluctable comparison. For instance, "A Portrait of the Times" (p. 92) presents a familiar scene: Two W. P. A. men stood in the new sluiceway overlooking the river — One was pissing Williams sets off one element of the scene by juxtaposing another: while an old squint-eyed woman in a black dress . . . turned her back on them at the corner A typically American still life gives the sense of a world, but the familiarity of the scene comes not from our sense of America, but, in all likelihood, from our sense of Joyce's dear dirty Dublin. This "Portrait" suggests the world of Portrait of the Artist, the aesthetic heart of which is, what this poem is, the epiphany. Few of Williams' poems are so specifically and immediately remi niscent of Joyce, but almost all of the early short poems come very close to Joyce's definition of the epiphany. The concept of the epiph any is particularly useful in the discussion of Williams because it 3 Norfolk, Conn., 1938. All poems quoted in this article are taken from this edition.

At its simplest the epiphany is a perception of the ultimate significance of ordinary things, a sense of heightened reality which need not sug gest underlying spiritual forces, need not, like the haiku, suggest the basic unity of all things. Joyce's, or rather Stephen Dedalus', most explicit definition of the epiphany appears in Stephen Hero, the incom plete first draft of Portrait. Stephen means by epiphany " a sudden spiritual manifestation," but he describes that manifestation in the rigorously logical terms of Aquinas' requirements for beauty. The first two are integrity and symmetry; the third is radiance, claritas. Claritas is quidditas. After the analysis which discovers the second quality the mind makes the only logically possible synthesis and discovers the third quality. This is the moment which I call epiphany. First we recognize that the object is one integral thing, then we recognize that it is an organized composite structure, a thing in fact: finally, when the relation of parts is exquisite, when the parts are adjusted to the special point, we recognize that it is that thing which it is. Its soul, its whatness, leaps to us from the vestment of its appearance. The soul of the commonest object, the structure of which is so adjusted, seems to us radiant. The object achieves its epiphany.4 Indicatively, it achieves it not in mystic unity but in separation (Stephen's first step in perceiving is to isolate the object from every thing else) and as a result not of meditation but analysis. Some Joyce critics have attempted to view the epiphany in tra ditionally mystical terms, or to see it primarily as a projection of the perceiving consciousness, but these interpretations seem to violate Stephen's definition, though they may be true of some of the types of epiphany in Fortrait. " The object achieves its epiphany." It is not, as S. L. Goldberg points out, "the object turned into a symbol of some other object or of some higher Reality," nor is it " a moment of mental experience, a brief state of emotion, and claritas the subjective reaction to, or the ' emotional content' of, the perception of objects." 5 'Norfolk, Conn., 1944, p. 213. EThe Classical Temper (New York, 1961), pp. 214, 329.</page><page sequence="4">" Claritas " : William Carlos Williams' Epiphanies What the epiphany ideally does is to reveal things as they are, but as they are in their particular essences. What is revealed is the ideal form of the thing in the thing itself, its " quidditas" soul." The epiphany suggests a mysticism of this world, without recourse to any sort of transcendentalism; this is the heart of Williams' poetry. Without transcendentalism, and within the terms of dualistic and analytic logic, there is nonetheless the sense of radiance. What Stephen describes as claritas, Williams frequently describes in images of bright ness, or flame, or the radiance of precious metals, an essence hidden in things. In discovering this essence, the poem " focuses the world," 0 but this does not mean, as Miller claims, that in the poem "the par ticular is the universal," that is, " existence." 7 It isn't, though it may be a universal of sorts, almost a Platonic form, but embedded in things. so much depends upon a red wheel barrow glazed with rain water beside the white chickens (p. 277) The scene remains particular, with its own individual radiance, though it is not particularly realistic in any superficial sense. Williams seeks a reality of essences, not surfaces, and he creates it through analysis and deliberate artificiality. The primary analytic force in the poem comes from the line divisions, which fragment the image, forcing apprehension of one quality, almost one essence, at a time. As Miller points out (in relation to another poem), "Williams' metrical effects have an extraordinary power to bring each word out in its 'thing ness.' "8 The separation between " red wheel" and " barrow," for instance, seems almost to rest on a deliberate awareness of the scholastic separation between substance and accidents, between redness or wheeled-ness and barrow-ness. In the last two lines of the poem, the substance-accident distinction is suggested even more literally by a" Midas: A Proposal for a Magazine," Selected Essays of William Carlos Williams (New York, 1954), p. 242. 'Miller, p. 311. "Miller, p. 298.</page><page sequence="5">26 Anthony Libby the separations between " rain " and " water " and between " white " and " chickens." Having separated the scene from the rest of reality, having defined its integrity, Williams proceeds to reduce it artificially to idealized essences. Particularly the red (not rust) and the white (not mud-speckled) give the sense of the stark simplicity of abstract forms perceived in things. Rather than detracting from it, the artificiality of the analytic pro cess adds to the sense of reality, as does the distancing metaphor implied by "glazed." The artist of the commonplace must distance, must create an artificial context in order to force perception of the particularity of simple things. Discussing Juan Gris in Spring and All, Williams mentions the painter's technique with " things with which he is familiar, simple things—at the same time to detach them from ordinary experience to the imagination. Thus they are still' real,' they are the same things they would be if photographed or painted by Monet, they are recognizable as the things touched by the hands during the day, but in this painting they are seen to be in some particular way—detached."9 Everyday reality can blur the deeper reality of essences, which is the reality the imagination seeks and creates in art. Again Williams' articulation of this has a Platonic ring, though his forms remain immanent. "In the composition, the artist does exactly what every eye must do with life, fix the particular with the uni versality of his own personality—Taught by the largeness of his imagination to feel every form which he sees moving within himself, he must prove the truth of this by expression."10 Again, the description of non-transcendental union of subject and object suggests the epiph any. One of the "expressions" which separates these two analytic pas sages in Spring and All is "The Rose," which seeks a revelation of essence through geometrically specific analysis, and which despite the infinity of one of the geometric lines it describes seems basically to deny critical statements about Williams' super-logical or anti-logical tendencies. Once more Miller, the most perceptive critic, offers a description which typifies critical exaggerations in this area. " The poet must transcend the limitations of logical, visual, or geometrical space in order to bring into existence the new poetry of multiple elements in fluid intimacy. . . .

He describes the scene metaphorically (" plantlike stem") but the metaphor is not created by bringing some new element to the scene; As usual, with the analysis, there is the attempt to distance, to render artificial in aid of fresh perception of essence. Here also Williams imagines the object as something "glazed" (on a plate), and visualizes " copper roses" and " steel roses" as well as petals of metal or porcelain. Like the perceived moment in "A Portrait of the Times," the Joycean epiphany is frequently achieved through juxtaposition of similar or dissimilar objects, juxtaposition which like the deliberate artificiality of "The Rose" functions to distance the commonplace. Two things come together to set each other off; frequently the juxtaposition is metaphorical or has metaphorical implications, and usually it forces a new vision of the things involved, as in "Flowers by the Sea." "Miller, p. 313.</page><page sequence="7">28 Anthony Libby rather in some sense metaphor already physically exists. Williams does not create but analyzes a juxtaposition, abstracting two elements of a scene and then joining them in comparison. " Circled " by that which it is compared to, the sea becomes one swaying whole rather than many waves; the strength of the epiphany here is primarily in its evocation of integrltas. The poem is best considered as epiphany, weakest in its anthropomorphic use of natural objects. The suggested contrast between " restlessness" and " peacefully " does not partic ularly enrich the comparison between the sea and the flowers. Despite his brilliant use of traditional logic, Williams is sometimes less success ful with traditional patterns of symbolism. Williams' essential juxapositions are not always metaphorical; in fact they are often exactly the opposite, perceptions of contrasting elements in the scene described. This is the fundamental emphasis in "This Is Just to Say," in which the vital richness of the plums is set off by the coldness of the icebox, of which they partake. The simplicity of the poem is strikingly enriched by the sensuous depiction of the fruit, as usual described accident by separate accident. I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast Forgive me they were delicious so sweet and so cold (p. 354) A similar juxtaposition for contrast dominates " Spring and All," a somewhat more abstract or generalized epiphany than Williams' usual. The life that " quickens " in the plants near the " contagious hospital" is defined to a great extent by opposition to the cold wind, life defined by death. Likewise plant life is defined by comparative juxtaposition to the human life beginning in the hospital; Williams carefully calculates his description of the plants to imply the metaphor in very nearly literal language.</page><page sequence="8">" Claritas : William Carlos Williams Epiphanies 29 They enter the new world naked cold, uncertain of all save that they enter. All about them the cold, familiar wind— (p. 241) The faint suggestion of consciousness here, after the initial reference to the hospital, is enough to establish the plants-babies connection. As usual, Williams has constructed his comparison from materials physically at hand, but here we are unusually aware of the distance of the connection, of the mind that draws these particular ideas from these things. A poem like this is somewhat less like the ideal epiphany Stephen Dedalus describes in Stephen Hero and more like some of the extended epiphanies he experiences in Portrait of the Artist, epiphanies in which the subjectivity of the perceiver becomes a conspicuous factor. Such, theoretically, is not the case in "The Red Wheel barrow." But even in his more extended revelations Williams is usually skillful enough to keep our attention focused on his objects, not his sub jectivity. When Stephen experiences an epiphany in which revelation seems more imposed on objects than drawn from them, Joyce is revealing Stephen, not the object. Williams has different intentions. When his visions seem at first more eccentric than universal, he often manages to persuade us of their truth, changing our vision of the world. This happens in " Flowers by the Sea," or in " Spring and All," where the young plants do seem, finally, to partake of the essence of babies, but it happens most strikingly in the beautiful "The Botticellian Trees," in which ideas are imposed on things with such skill that they seem never to have been separate from them. " The Botticellian Trees" is another poem of analytic juxtaposition which creates a sense of revelation—and the ecstasy which accompanies revelation—through a fairly simple logical exercise in metaphor. The poem was originally published in Delia Primavera Transporte Al Morale, and that title, along with "Botticellian," inevitably suggests the painting " Primavera," which like the poem is as much a depiction of Venus as Spring. The alphabet of the trees is fading in the song of the leaves</page><page sequence="9">30 Anthony Libby the crossing bars of the thin letters that spelled winter and the cold have been illumined with pointed green by the rain and the strict simple principles of straight branches are being modified by pinched-out ifs of color, devout conditions the smiles of love— until the stript sentences move as a woman s limbs under cloth and praise from secrecy quick with desire love's ascendancy in summer— In summer the song sings itself above the muffled words— (p. 80) The grouping of metaphors, almost conceits, in this poem is far from the starkness of "The Red Wheelbarrow," but the final intention is similar. Again Williams analyzes the scene into its primary com ponents; though the poem concerns the growth of leaves on trees, the initial metaphors ("alphabet" vs. "song") separate leafness from treeness, and the following metaphors (" limbs under cloth " and song</page><page sequence="10">"Claritas " : William Carlos Williams' Epiphanies 31 written vs. song sung) depend on a very literal interpretation of the first separation. Williams begins with a rather artificial vision of bare branches forming letters, carries this perception through a series of logical changes, and ends with a synthesis of abstracted trees and leaves moving into flight as the song they have become. The essence of trees becomes the essence of summer, the scene achieves integrity, and, rapidly, radiance, claritas. The now of the poem is perhaps more reminiscent of Gerard Manley Hopkins' or Virginia Woolf's epiphanies than Joyce's, but it still fits Stephen's definition, and its induction of ecstasy from logic seems typical of the essential epiphany. In the best tradition of the scholastic thought that gave Joyce his definition (or that, through Duns Scotus, gave Hopkins a philosophical basis for his more traditionally mystical epiphanies) the poet becomes something of a pedant, applying to experience a consciously artificial and abstract logic (" strict simple / principles"), but recording or creating an individual essential reality with the superlogical definiteness of an absolute. He conveys an exultation close to mystical, but grounded in immediate fact, a mys ticism of particulars. This is the power that defines Williams' greatest poetry, his ability to describe a simple world in simple language, and through the logic and purity of his vision to create such genuine flowering.</page></plain_text>
