<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Beyond the Cheated Eye:  Dickinson’s Lyric Sociality Ryan  CuLL   ∂mily Dickinson’s personal and poetic    withdrawal from society has long fas- cinated even those readers outside of literary studies. During  the past generation, however, scholars have challenged much  of the Dickinson mythology by more extensively documenting  her intense relationships with a small circle of intimates; her  epistolary exchanges with many, more distant friends; and her  family’s broader socio-political context. Work by Martha nell  Smith, Judith Farr, Domhnall Mitchell, and Virginia Jackson,  among others, has made Dickinson scholarship a model for  how historicist and print-culture methodologies can illuminate  the social nexus of even a notoriously reticent figure. Such  studies also have had a broader impact on how we think about  lyric poetry in general. For Dickinson’s experiments with dual  authorship, hybrid-collage forms, and the blurring of stylistic  and formal lines between poem and letter indicate the social  embeddedness of what is often still considered a private genre.1  Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 65, no. 1, pp. 38–64.

Bakhtin’s defense of the novel  and critique of lyric poetry has had an ongoing influence, as has the tendency to associ- ate the study of poetry with more insular critical methodologies like the new Criticism  and early deconstruction. Several recent studies have recognized the need to challenge  this implicit skepticism toward poetry. See, for example, Gerald L. Bruns, The Material  of Poetry: Sketches for a Philosophical Poetics (athens: univ. of Georgia Press, 2005), p. 16;  38 NCL6501_02.indd   38 6/8/10   12:13:13 PM </page> <page sequence="2"> dickinson’s lyric sociality 39 More effort, however, could be put toward blending these two  lines of thought, in order to consider how Dickinson’s work  reveals potential applications of lyric poetry to how we theo- rize the social. Indeed, scholars strangely seem to balk at such  a subject. Some suggest that Dickinson’s poetry shows her only  “hesitati[ng]” or, at best, “giving place” before others—charac- terizations that suspiciously recall the old, supposedly displaced  mythology of the reclusive ghost of amherst.2 Others have sug- gested that since socio-cultural forces had standardized all po- etry as lyric poetry, Dickinson had no “way out” of the confines  of the Romantic lyrical subject, no way to craft a poetry capable  of reenvisioning subjectivity and thus also of reenvisioning the  way in which a subject relates to others.3 But such a claim too  easily identifies the limits of Dickinson’s culture with the lim- its of her imagination. So what prevents us from considering  the lyric (and here, especially, Dickinson’s lyrics) not only as a  socio-historically embedded form but also as a form that may  have application to our understanding of the social? Why are  we comfortable with elaborating the historical context but not  exploring the related theoretical application? In this essay I approach such difficult questions by exam- ining a remarkable group of poems and letters written by Dick- inson between 1862 and 1863. In this year (or so), perhaps the  pivotal period in her life, Dickinson obsessively analyzed social  interaction. I examine not only how Dickinson struggles with  a kind of possessiveness that undermines social relations, but  also how she identifies this possessiveness as the most perva- sive legacy of the Romantic paradigm of subjectivity.

But as I argue in the second  section of this essay, Dickinson may have felt less confined by  this Romantic paradigm of subjectivity than we do. Dickinson  criticism, which can serve as a microcosm of critical trends in  general, indicates how contemporary literary studies critiques  but never quite casts aside this Romantic subjectivity that still  limits our social theorizing. I then examine how Dickinson  investigates alternative models of subjectivity as she pursues  “another way – to see –” in “The Tint I cannot take – is best –,”  a poem that ridicules the Romantic paradigm before explor- ing a non-possessive form of subjectivity. But, at her most ambi- tious, Dickinson does more than just decouple the Romantic  4 Emily Dickinson, letter to T. W. Higginson, august 1862, in The Letters of Em- ily Dickinson, ed.

Further references  to Dickinson’s letters are to this edition and include the letter number preceded by  an “L.” Since Dickinson often wrote her letters, including some to Thomas Higginson,  in as compressed an idiom as her poems, one might balk at interpreting them. But by  fetishizing Dickinsonian difficulty, we turn her back into the unexplainably mysterious  recluse that the past two decades of criticism has convincingly overturned. Jed Deppman  recently has explained that “critics have made much of the difficulties Higginson had  in understanding Dickinson, but the truth is that they understood each other very well,  not least because so much of their conversation was about thought and literary writing  understood as thought” (Deppman, Trying to Think with Emily Dickinson [amherst: univ.  of Massachusetts Press, 2008], p. 62). 5   See Emily Dickinson, “Before I got my eye put out” (F336) and “I cannot dance  opon my toes” (F381), in The Poems of Emily Dickinson, ed.

In the final section I examine “There  came a Day at Summer’s full,” a poem that embeds within the  lyric this alternative subjectivity in order to see how it might  foster a revolutionary, pacifistic form of social relation. Dickinson’s letters suggest that her pe- riod of increasing self-seclusion from social events in amherst  throughout her mid twenties to early thirties also paralleled a  yearning for companionship. as she grew into adulthood, Dick- inson quickly learned that romantic relationships, in particular,  entailed compromises that potentially threatened her intellec- tual independence. She struggled during the 1850s to balance  these competing needs. Dickinson’s letters reveal her desire for  intimacy not infrequently veering toward possessiveness. “Jennie  – my Jennie Humphrey. . . . How I wish you were mine, as you  once were, when I had you in the morning, and when the sun  went down,” Dickinson writes in a 16 October 1855 letter to her  old friend Jane Humphrey, who had lived with the Dickinsons  more than a decade earlier (L180; in Letters, II, 320). Other let- ters from the 1850s reveal Dickinson similarly asserting to Dr.  Josiah Holland: “Tell Mrs. Holland she is mine. ask her if vice  versa?” (L195; 6 november 1858; in Letters, II, 341).6 Though  such extravagant rhetoric was not wholly unusual for the time  and not always without humor, Dickinson’s need to assert con- trol, to demand centrality in another person’s life (even above  and beyond that person’s spouse) at times crossed a line. Hum- phrey, for example, never again corresponded with Dickinson.7 a similar, but even more complex, relationship developed  between Dickinson and her close friend and eventual sister-in- law Susan Gilbert. Even Martha nell Smith, who argues that  Emily and Sue established a long-term “poetry workshop,” ac- knowledges that during these years Dickinson’s letters to Sue  6  See Richard B.

Though her “declarations” go largely un- requited after Sue’s marriage to austin Dickinson, Emily per- sists in addressing her sister-in-law in “lover-like fashion” well  after the marriage.8 Judith Farr has read the series of enigmatic  “Malay” poems (e.g., “Removed from accident of Loss” [F417],  Poems, I, 439–40; and “The Malay took the pearl” [F451],  Poems, I, 471–72), written around 1862, as psychodramas de- picting Dickinson’s emotional conflicts in the wake of austin’s  marriage to Sue. In these poems, the “Malay” (austin) seems to  steal from the speaker (Emily) a great “Pearl” (Sue), resulting  in a mixture of regret, frustration, and envy, since the pearl  had been prized as the speaker’s possession.9 This tendency toward possessiveness becomes a recurrent  concern throughout Dickinson’s poetry in the period from  1862 to 1863. This period was filled with pivotal events. Though  she deeply suffered in the wake of a never explicitly revealed  personal trauma, Dickinson also began to focus her intellectual  energies on poetry to such a degree that she produced about  a poem a day and even began to reach out to a potential men- tor, Thomas Higginson. and one of the most intriguing expres- sions of this concern about possessiveness appears in her early  correspondence with Higginson, where she seems to identify  it as not just a personal peccadillo or a localized defect in her  own poetic technique but as the central feature of a flawed yet  pervasive paradigm for relating to otherness. In her first letters to her “preceptor,” written during the  spring and summer of 1862, Dickinson clearly hopes for Hig- ginson’s help in isolating and overcoming a poetic and possibly  even a personal weakness. In a 15 april 1862 letter she initially  asks whether her “Verse is alive” (L260; in Letters, II, 403). It  is a serious request and also a pun, given the fact that several  enclosed poems address “existential . . . questions” (Deppman,  Trying to Think with Emily Dickinson, p. 58).

Dickinson was puzzled by Higginson’s reply, however,  as Jed Deppman explains: she seems startled by the way Higginson answered her [by] . . .  comment[ing] on form: her “gait spasmodic,” her style “uncon- trolled” (L265). Shouldn’t he have said what he thought of her  thinking, or explained how he could find “spasmodic” the same  writing she hoped had “told it clear” (L265)? (Trying to Think  with Emily Dickinson, p. 59) as if responding to Higginson’s criticism of her “spasmodic”  lack of rhythmic mastery, Dickinson offers in her august 1862  letter “a thirty-four-syllable series of perfect iambics, punctuated  in alternating trimeter and tetrameter [a variation of the ballad  form she often used]. . . . ‘I thank you for the truth. I had no  monarch in my life, and cannot rule myself; and when I try to  organize, my little force explodes’” (Deppman, Trying to Think  with Emily Dickinson, pp. 59–60). But after this moment of ap- parent deference, she then more assertively attempts (in rhyme,  no less) to clarify the kind of advice that she really seeks: “you  say I confess the little mistake, and omit the large – Because I  can see Orthography – but the Ignorance out of sight – is my  Preceptor’s charge –” (L271; in Letters, II, 415). Such a com- ment, expressing her self-awareness about superficial eccentric- ities in her work (including her occasionally unusual, perhaps  seemingly “uncontrolled,” orthography), belies the contention  made by some scholars that Dickinson went to Higginson in the  hope of overcoming a “technical . . . disorderliness.”10 Indeed,  one of the two poems enclosed with this letter, “I cannot dance  opon my Toes –” (F381), scoffs at such a notion by contending  that though she lacks formal “Ballet” training, she nevertheless  “know[s] the art.” Like a “Prima [Ballerina],” she places every  foot-fall in her poetry exactly where she planned it (“easy –  Here –”), perhaps formally unusual but nevertheless a product  of a virtuoso artist in command of her medium. 10  See David Porter, Dickinson: The Modern Idiom (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard univ.  Press, 1981), p. 144.

But here Dickinson, displaying no small amount of formal and  rhetorical skill, allows it to expand to a frighteningly universal  scale in order to show its full consequences: Before I got my eye put out I liked as well to see – as other Creatures, that have Eyes and know no other way – But were it told to me – today – That I might have the sky For mine – I tell you that my Heart Would split, for size of me – The meadows – mine – The Mountains – mine – all Forests – Stintless Stars – as much of noon as I could take Between my finite eyes – The Motions of The Dipping Birds – The Morning’s amber Road – For mine – to look at when I liked – The news would strike me dead – So safer Guess – With just my soul opon the Window pane – Where other Creatures put their eyes – Incautious – of the Sun –            (F336; Poems, I, 361–62) The blinding that begins the poem recalls one of the oldest and  most repeated Western literary traditions: a poet-figure initially  NCL6501_02.indd   44 6/8/10   12:13:14 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> dickinson’s lyric sociality 45 is set apart by being stripped of one kind of sight in favor of a  new, more farsighted, visionary one. But no sooner is this tradi- tion invoked than it is subjected to a characteristically Dickinso- nian sense of irony. For the speaker of this poem is not entering  into the more elevated, comprehensively visionary stance de- scribed in the succeeding stanzas, but instead leaving it behind  in favor of a more modest one. The irony deepens as we see  that this rejected visionary stance resembles a typically Roman- tic expression of joy toward nature’s beauty, a joy that reaches a  momentary intensity before becoming tinged with regret as the  speaker recognizes her incapacity fully to appreciate nature’s  magnificence. In moments like these, Dickinson interrogates  the act that lies at the center of many Romantic theories of sub- jectivity, the act of sublimation common in Romantic literature  and philosophy in which otherness is seen, encountered, and  hopefully assimilated to the self. Such a model, as Gary Stonum  has argued (following Thomas Weiskel), underlies Kant’s accounts of the dynamic and mathematical sublime, . . .  [reveals the idea emerging in predecessors like] the natural sub- lime as represented by Burke and earlier eighteenth-century crit- ics and poets, [highlights a central, conceptual common-ground  shared by] Hegel’s negative and dialectical sublime, the Words- worthian egotistical or positive sublime, and [even anticipates]  Freud’s [later] account of sublimation and related defenses.  (The Dickinson Sublime, p. 69)11 Given Dickinson’s socio-historical context, her poem’s imagery  particularly recalls Ralph Waldo Emerson’s interpretation of this  process of sublimation depicted by his famous eyeball that seeks  to “see all” and be “part or particle of God.” But while Emerson  argues that by practicing this way of seeing “all mean egotism  vanishes” amid a moment of transcendence, Dickinson suggests  that a possessive egotism is more likely to be all that remains.12 11  See Thomas Weiskel, The Romantic Sublime: Studies in the Structure and Psychology of  Transcendence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins univ. Press, 1976). 12 Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nature (1836, 1849), in his Essays and Lectures, ed. Joel  Porte (new york: Literary Classics of the united States, 1983), p. 10.

The blinding had not  been sought; she “liked” seeing in the old way just fine. and no  sooner is this possibility raised than the hesitating gait of the first  two stanzas yields to the pulsating parallelism of the third stanza.  She imagines all of creation (“meadows,” “Mountains,” “Forests,”  “Stars,” “Birds,” etc.) made subject to her sight. So excessively  exhilarating is the thought that she exclaims that “The news”  of nature’s splendor “would strike [her] dead.” Only under  such mortal risk is blindness, whether imposed or self-inflected,  preferable. But the poem is not simply an over-the-top paean to beauty.  Even if one takes into account Dickinson’s considerable capacity  for hyperbole, there is more than mere joy driving the speaker.  What truly excites and ultimately terrifies her is not nature’s  splendor but her desire for that splendor to be “mine.” It is as  if the speaker slips into the pseudo-royal persona of “Mine – by  the Right of the White Election!” (F411; Poems, I, 435–36),  a roughly contemporaneous poem that also features the first- person possessive pronoun as a constant refrain that is both  grandiose and childish. But the speaker in “Before I got my  eye put out” seems to sense that this petulant possessiveness  (“For mine – to look at when I liked –”), rather than yielding  an expansive apprehension of the world’s otherness, ultimately  collapses into solipsism. and so, in the final stanza, we return to the tentative  rhythms of the first two stanzas. The speaker wryly assesses her  gained wisdom. The opening stanza suggests that she had found  some “other way” to see. But the poem does not follow ancient  tradition; the speaker does not become a blind prophet/vision- ary. While her fellow “Creatures” “Incautious[ly]” continue to  see with their eyes, risking blindness by staring at “the Sun,”  austin. The Dickinsons owned collections of Emerson’s essays, a number of which were  likely “marked” by Emily (see Habegger, My Wars Are Laid Away in Books, pp. 219, 372;  and Sewall, The Life of Emily Dickinson, II, 468, 678).

Such a stance is  “safer,” she rather ambivalently “Guess[es],” since it is immune  to her formerly unchecked ocular ambitions. But the speaker  seems to wonder with resignation: after so much had seemed  within reach, is this all that I am left with? One wonders what sort of advice Dickinson hoped Higgin- son would offer in response to this expression of dissatisfaction  with the Romantic paradigm of poetic subjectivity. Is this the  “Ignorance out of sight” that she claimed was her “Preceptor’s  charge,” an unwillingness to see as her contemporaries have  been seeing yet an ignorance about how to generate a poetics  offering an alternative way to interact with otherness? One can- not be certain of Dickinson’s intentions, but here we can be- gin to identify what makes her poetics distinct. She was not the  only nineteenth-century writer to find that “when thought fails  [rather than succeeds] to satisfy its own demands . . . the sub- lime can begin” (Deppman, Trying to Think with Emily Dickinson,  p. 193). neither was she the only nineteenth-century thinker to  have worried, more generally, about the consequences of the  urge to sublimate: William Wordsworth and John Keats explored  the possibility of less possessive models of sublimation. But Dick- inson wrote a generation later in the wake of Emerson’s model  of Romantic subjectivity. While the British Romantics sought to  bring the diction and syntax of the common man into their po- etry, Emerson extends this logic further, announcing that poetic  sight is available to all. Though he warns that “few adult persons  can see nature,” Emerson also makes it clear that this visionary  potential resides in everyone (including the farmers “Miller . . .  Locke . . . and Manning”) everyday (Nature, pp. 10, 9). a poem  like “Before I got my eye put out” indicates how Emerson’s radi- cally democratized Romanticism catalyzes Dickinson, making it  possible for her to imagine herself as a great visionary. But it also  reveals how she rejects the fundamentally dangerous and self- destructive qualities of this model of subjectivity. Indeed, we will  see that Dickinson, at her most ambitious, can be distinguished  from her fellow Romantics by her refusal to accept sublimation,  the drive to assimilate otherness, as the central act of a subject’s  self-expression and the foundation of intersubjectivity. NCL6501_02.indd   47 6/8/10   12:13:14 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> 48  nineteenth-century literature Gary Lee Stonum contends that this simul- taneous rejection of and fascination with Romantic poetic sight  leaves Dickinson’s poems locked in a moment of “characteris- tic hesitation” in relation to otherness, a stance not unlike the  ambivalent concluding lines (“So safer Guess –”) of “Before I  got my eye put out.” He describes this uneasy ambivalence as “a  deferential sublime” and suggests that “cultivating the force of  the [Romantic] sublime while withholding sublimation fosters  [Dickinson’s poetic] wildness,” due to the fact that she refuses  the “agonistic rivalry [that] is the very motor of the sublime”  (The Dickinson Sublime, pp. 156, 190, 150). Sharon Cameron,  somewhat similarly, identifies Dickinson’s poetics under the ru- bric “choosing not choosing,” highlighting poems that hesitate  to choose between multiple, unreconcilable choices and voices.  For Cameron this “spaciousness” within these poems is useful  for “mak[ing] available . . . interiority itself.”13 But while Ston- um’s and Cameron’s studies remain valuable, their “hesitation”  and “choosing not choosing” paradigms seem to offer lyric in- teriority perhaps too easily as a corollary to Dickinson’s social  reticence. More recent critics have tended to interrogate rather  than valorize (as Cameron does) this lyric interiority and Dick- inson’s association with it. The most formidable such reading  surely must be Virginia Jackson’s 2005 book, Dickinson’s Misery.  Jackson offers Dickinson’s poetry and its critical history as an  example of how writing and reading lyric poetry has become  unjustly synonymous with the production and consumption of  an interiorized discourse that effaces historical specificity. She  offers extensive evidence of how this “theory of personal ex- pression and abstraction” associated with the lyric already in  the mid nineteenth century “was highly problematic for Dick- inson.” But Jackson nevertheless dramatically concludes that  there is no “way out of the lyric or out of lyric reading as theory  or practice, for Dickinson or anyone else” (Dickinson’s Misery,  pp. 236, 235). 13  Sharon Cameron, Choosing Not Choosing: Dickinson’s Fascicles (Chicago: univ. of  Chicago Press, 1992), pp. 186–87.

For it reveals that the ultimate  difference between Jackson and Cameron or Stonum is not the  coidentification of lyric and interiority but the degree of regret  about its inevitability. But why does Jackson ultimately concur  with the conclusions of arguments that otherwise could not be  more different from her own? Her no “way out” rhetoric gives  us a clue. For Jackson’s conclusion, with its striking combina- tion of reticence and ambition, echoes the style of the scholar  whom she analyzes in the most theoretical portion of her book:  Paul de Man. Jackson convincingly argues that de Man’s major  essay on lyric poetry, “anthropomorphism and Trope in the  Lyric” (1984), “perform[s] . . . not the disappearance of the lyric  subject, but the appearance of the critical subject of the lyric,”  which she contends is “the argument of Dickinson’s Misery in  reverse” (Dickinson’s Misery, p. 100). While de Man argues that  lyrics enact the fiction of poetic subjecthood, Jackson argues  that de Man’s essay simply enacts a similar fiction, the fiction  of critical subjecthood. The Romantic subjectivity’s assertion of  mastery insidiously extends even further than de Man knew, or  anyone can know. Jackson’s print-culture methodology helps  her to see that de Man’s deconstructive reasoning ultimately is  not wrong but incomplete, insofar as it did not “allow for [the  reality of] ‘historical modes of language power’ ” that encompass  not just the poet but the whole social structure involved in the  production of art, including critics, readers, and beyond (Dick- inson’s Misery, p. 109). Jackson’s correction of de Man is persuasive, but it is  important to see that she does not so much refute de Man’s  argument as out-de Man de Man. This continuity is hardly sur- prising. Deconstruction and subsequent historicist method- ologies, after all, share a similar goal: both pride themselves  (often rightly) on their ability to illumine hidden, violent era- sures of otherness, whether in language, philosophy, or his- tory itself. But both methodologies approach this task, as de  Man and Jackson contend, with a severe handicap. For they  believe that there is no “way out,” no way to engage others  (or even to recover the lost record of others) that does not  to some degree further exploit them, that does not in some  way impose the manipulating powers of the (lyrical or critical)  NCL6501_02.indd   49 6/8/10   12:13:14 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> 50  nineteenth-century literature subject, the same possessive, Romantic subject that Dickinson  so succinctly describes in “Before I got my eye put out.” Here  we see a danger: overlooked and perhaps unjustified premises  embedded within our critical methodologies can obscure what  these methodologies ostensibly hope to illumine. Implicitly  presuming the Romantic, possessive view of subjectivity makes  it nearly impossible to imagine consequent social relations as  anything but possessive and conflictual.14 Dickinson scholarship has been constrained by such pre- sumptions. Dickinson’s social context and contacts have now  been broadly documented and have helped put to rest oversim- plified generalizations about her reclusiveness. But when her  work is acknowledged to have a social vision, it is all too often  confined by the terms set by the Romantic understanding of  subjectivity. Marianne noble, for example, explains how Dick- inson depicts social relations according to a masochistic logic.  Considering studies on the sublime by both Immanuel Kant  and Edmund Burke, she argues that female intellectuals like  Dickinson “recognized that control through submission repre- sented an important mode of feminine agency.”15 Dickinson’s  masochistic, “deferential sublime” (to use Stonum’s phrase)  thus can be understood as both a poetics and a social strategy  that allow a woman simultaneously to tap into the power of the  sublime while also implicitly beginning to offer a critique of it.  “Before I got my eye put out” follows such a strategy in its long- ing for and criticism of Romantic poetics. and certain poems  from 1862–1863, such as “I started Early – Took my Dog –”  (F656; Poems, II, 640, which noble discusses) or “I can wade  Grief –” (F312; Poems, I, 331–32), reveal Dickinson applying  such a paradigm to social relations. But other, contemporaneous poems, such as “again – his  voice is at the door –” (F274; Poems, I, 291–92) or “He touched  me, so I live to know” (F349; Poems, I, 374–75) are more com- plicated. “again – his voice is at the door –” presents a speaker  14  Jackson’s no “way out” rhetoric also oversimplifies the variety of nineteenth- century lyric poetry.

Dickinson presents them charmingly stam- mering at each other before they share a happy moment “alone”  under “a tender – thoughtful Moon” (ll. 21, 19; Dickinson’s em- phasis). The fact that such glimpses of genuine mutuality are  not unequivocally sustained in these poems indicates that the  paradigm of sublimation had become ingrained within the  lyric genre. But these poems also indicate that Dickinson was  exploring other ways of imagining social (and even intimate)  relations beyond those dictated by the possessive Romantic sub- jectivity. Indeed, by interrogating rather than merely illustrat- ing the linguistic and critical aporias identified by de Man and  Jackson, these poems help us see that the lyric may be the genre  most capable of helping us to conceptualize the new forms of  subjectivity necessary for fostering new forms of sociality. In order to investigate Dickinson’s search  for an alternative subjectivity, we need to take seriously the ad- vice that she gave to Higginson, when she steered him away  from overemphasizing peripheral concerns and toward con- cerns about poetic sight that Dickinson deemed more critical.16  Though Higginson never responds to the poet’s plea for help  in remediating the “Ignorance out of sight,” another work from  1862–1863, “The Tint I cannot take – is best –” (F696) pres- ents Dickinson exploring “another,” less possessive, “way – to  see.”17 In this poem, the speaker’s possessive eyes encounter na- ture and are thwarted. But while “Before I got my eye put out”  16  I am not suggesting that Dickinson was unconcerned about how her poems  could be disfigured (see Franklin’s discussion of the publication of “a narrow fell  in the grass,” F1096, in Poems, II, 951–55). Rather, I am suggesting that Dickinson  felt the primary challenge offered in her poetry was not located in the matters that  gave Higginson most concern or those that Jackson’s important study often focuses on  (i.e., the dead crickets, postage stamps, flowers, and other cut-outs that constitute the  poems’ material context). 17 Two months later, in a 6 October 1862 letter, Dickinson asks: “Did I displease  you, Mr. Higginson? But wont you tell me how?” (L274; in Letters, II, 417). Though  he was then preparing for his military deployment, one wonders whether Higginson  found the request too opaque or recognized that it was beyond his interest or skill.

Rather than revealing nostalgia  for the powers and pleasures of sublimation, this poem mocks  the Romantic paradigm of subjectivity. Her speaker questions  whether subjectivity need be driven by possessiveness, which  helps her begin to imagine a way of relating to otherness be- yond masochism or hesitation. The Tint I cannot take – is best – The Color too remote That I could show it in Bazaar – a Guinea at a sight – The fine – impalpable array – That swaggers on the eye Like Cleopatra’s Company – Repeated – in the sky – The Moments of Dominion That happen on the Soul and leave it with a Discontent Too exquisite – to tell – The eager look – on Landscapes – as if they just repressed Some secret – that was pushing Like Chariots – in the Vest – The Pleading of the Summer – That other Prank – of Snow – That Cushions Mystery with Tulle, For fear the Squirrels – know. Their Graspless manners – mock us – until the Cheated Eye Shuts arrogantly – in the Grave – another way – to see –          (F696; Poems, II, 666–67) Dickinson’s use of the word “Tint” in the first line is cru- cial, for it suggests shadings more subtle than simple colors.  She contends, as she did in “Before I got my eye put out,” that  seeing goes beyond the direct process of receiving visual data.  Instead, it is more closely akin to a “tak[ing],” a claiming of  NCL6501_02.indd   52 6/8/10   12:13:14 PM </page> <page sequence="16"> dickinson’s lyric sociality 53 ownership and possession. But this poem refuses to be confined  by acquisitive models of subjectivity. To underline this refusal,  the speaker, instead of continuing in her mode of negation,  shifts to the superlative: “The Tint I cannot take – is best –” (em- phasis added). Her first stanza thus assesses the poetic process  not simply by acknowledging that nuances may elude a person’s  epistemological possessiveness (as other Romantics occasion- ally did), but by asserting that the elusiveness of these nuances  ought to be celebrated. The speaker then mocks the desire for  mastery, identifying it as the mentality of a banal peep-show  manager at a “Bazaar,” showing his stolen (“taken”) goods “a  Guinea at a sight –.” The remaining stanzas share a thematic relationship to  the first. Each features another image dancing on the limits  of perception. This raises a difficult question: insofar as the  speaker continues to describe these “Tint[s]” (or “array[s],”  “Moments,” “eager look[s],” “Pleading[s],” “Prank[s]”), does  she not “take” them? Or to ask the question as many recent  theorists have: in writing about otherness, does she inevitably  violate it? and does the lyrical subjectivity provide a particu- larly powerful conduit for such violence? We shall see that the  rest of Dickinson’s poem offers the lyric as a form capable of  modeling a way to encounter otherness without ever demand- ing that it become “mine.” In another poem from 1862, “How the old Mountains drip  with Sunset” (F327; Poems, I, 350), Dickinson explains that she  may have an advantage over her peers in the visual arts. For po- ets are less confined by a mimetic aesthetics.18 By ingeniously  using metaphor, metonymy, or any number of other tropes, she  may evoke nature without claiming to represent it. Indeed, she  can use these tropes to make the opposite claim, as she does  in “The Tint I cannot take – is best –,” where each stanza takes  her further from the Romantic paradigm of poethood while  nevertheless bringing her closer to otherness without needing  to possess it. 18 Dickinson wrote at a time just before the “age of mechanical reproduction” (as  Walter Benjamin put it) was fully underway, before the visual arts turned away from  mimesis.

Rather than a single, “remote” nuance  of color, we are now presented with a full spectrum, an image  perhaps taken from the sunsets that Dickinson loved to watch.  But since this “array” is “impalpable,” barely tangible to her,  she suspects that it “swaggers” with self-confidence on her un- aware “eye.” Its teasing is made all the greater by its metaphori- cal association with “Cleopatra’s Company.” What eludes Dick- inson may be no average insight, but a discovery comparable  to one of the most celebrated moments in all of Shakespeare.  yet, in the juxtaposition between the vernacular “swagger[ing]”  and the erudite allusion, the curiously whimsical mood of the  poem is not only sustained but made more emphatic. With the  third stanza’s “Moments of Dominion,” the teasing of the sec- ond stanza develops into a greater power. no longer fearing  her grasp, otherness runs rampant, even “on the [speaker’s]  Soul.” The opening stanzas, thus, dramatize a letting-go of the  drive to master and possess, enacting what would be the great- est fear of most Romantic poets: a slow, struggling, yet steady  release of epistemic control. yet Dickinson denies that this is  something to be mourned. For the poem’s rhetorical registra- tions lead us from a possible sense of inadequacy in performing  the stereotypical role of a poet, through a rejection of that role,  and toward a new role more hospitable to otherness. The effects of this new model of subjectivity are felt im- mediately in the fourth stanza, for much of the self- (and even  human-) centeredness of her poem seems to have vanished.  It is as if she is trying to imagine her gaze within the context  of the world’s other gazes without invoking the possessiveness  that she also struggled against in “Before I got my eye put out.”  There is a presumed human speaker, but there are no more  complaints about remoteness, impalpability, or discontent.  The universe no longer is evaluated with regard to its proxim- ity to Emily Dickinson. Instead, in the transitional first line of  the fourth stanza, she teases us with the placement of her dash.  The “eager look” is not found on her but on the “Landscapes.”  She seems to be observing some sort of marvelous conspiracy.  For this “look – on Landscapes – ” makes it appear “as if they  NCL6501_02.indd   54 6/8/10   12:13:15 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> dickinson’s lyric sociality 55 just repressed / Some secret.” Thus the poem’s mood remains  wryly jovial. and the games have only just begun. With the fifth and sixth stanzas, we see more “Prank[s].”  What had been “eager” in the fourth stanza has intensified into  a more intimate appeal, a “Pleading.” The illustration concerns  the seasons. Both summer and winter tease the speaker. Winter  is particularly clever, covering “Mystery” with a layer of snow, in  the process making the “secret[s]” that the “Landscapes” had  been “repress[ing]” in the previous stanza even more impos- sible to “take.” The “Graspless manners” of the squirrels “mock  us” because this poem has illustrated that we fare no better than  they. Even as we seek to grasp otherness, the many “Tint[s]”  and “secret[s]” elude us, as well. The final stanza then suddenly declares that the “Cheated  Eye” dies hard, “Shut[ting] arrogantly” only upon its arrival  “in the Grave.”19 Such sentiments imply that “another,” non- possessive, “way – to see – ” is no more tangible in this life than  it had been in “Before I got my eye put out.” But this reading  overlooks the syntactic ambiguity generated by the many dashes  both before and within the poem’s final line. While “another  way – to see – ,” in the context of the final stanza, explains what  may be gained after the “Cheated Eye” finally dies, the dashes  also suggest that the final line may be read as the poem’s overall  19  It is telling that Sharon Cameron, Gary Lee Stonum, and Joanne Feit Diehl each  struggle to reconcile this poem with their conclusions about how Dickinson relates  to Romanticism. Cameron claims that the word “swaggers” “characterizes the way of  seeing” and “inevitably implies” that “the vision in the poem has an ‘arrogan[ce]’ of  its own.” The “swagger[ing],” however, is not of the speaker’s eye, but an effect of the  “impalpable array – / . . . on the eye” (Choosing Not Choosing, p. 165, emphasis added).  The difference between the prepositions is crucial, for it implies a yielding, rather than  a repossession, of epistemic control. Stonum asserts that “the dominion foreshadowed  in ‘The tint I cannot take’ is clearly a form of mastery.” But his reading also rests on a  misinterpretation of prepositions. The “Moments of Dominion” are not caused by the  speaker but “happen on the [speaker’s] Soul” (The Dickinson Sublime, pp. 75, 74). Diehl  entitles a chapter on Dickinson “another Way to See,” an echo of this poem’s final line.  But beyond this chapter title, she never addresses the poem, perhaps because it com- plicates her argument that “in the face of Emerson’s poet, Dickinson . . . seeks to place  her consciousness at the center of a self-made world” ( Joanne Feit Diehl, Women Poets  and the American Sublime [Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana univ. Press, 1990],  p. 26).

Its relent- lessly jovial rhetoric and gradually less speaker-centered per- spective begins to enact the death of the possessive Romantic  subject. and this unfolding epistemic transformation leads to  an ontological transformation.20 Rather than settling for the un- easy stasis that seems to conclude “Before I got my eye put out,”  the speaker of “The Tint I cannot take – is best –” allows this  deep challenge to her way of knowing to reshape her subject- hood, her very way of being, and thus her relations to other be- ings. The world and its inhabitants, far from being made more  distant, begin to approach the speaker. “Prank[s]” are played  and the speaker even suffers a few uneasy “Moments of Domin- ion.” But by the end of the poem, among the “eager look[s]”  and “Pleading,” she seems to begin to earn the trust of (and to  have learned how to trust) otherness without threat and rivalry. While this poem’s non-possessive paradigm offers an al- ternative to our post-Romantic understanding of subjectivity,  it still lacks a clear social vision. One advantage of the Roman- tic paradigm of subjectivity is that sublimation, though it may  be conflict-ridden, possessive, and even masochistic in its con- sequences, offers a clear explanation of how social relations  proceed. and this is something that its critics often leave trou- blingly hazy. yet this haziness is not a product of intellectual  neglect. For it is the very mechanism of knowing that critics of  Romanticism always find dangerously flawed. They claim that  the process of sublimation, driven by the desire for mastery over  otherness that we saw in “Before I got my eye put out,” leads to  a kind of epistemological vanity that short-circuits any hope of  20  Judith Butler explains that, for Michel Foucault, “the cost of being critical of . . .  norms. . . . [is that] the very ontological status of a subject becomes destabilized” (But- ler, quoted in “Judith Butler: Reanimating the Social,” in nicholas Gane, The Future of  Social Theory [London and new york: Continuum, 2004], pp. 69–70). Such reasoning  resembles Dickinson’s argument in “The Tint I cannot take – is best –.” But while Dick- inson’s goal is to find an alternative to the possessive, Romantic subjectivity, Foucault’s  understanding of power in the social realm remains a consequence of this model of  subjectivity, even late in his career when he explores the possibility of challenging the  edifice of power from within.

Though Romantic paradigms like Hegel’s chart a hy- pothetical development beyond this initial aggression, thinkers  as different as Stanley Cavell, Jacques Derrida, and Slavoj Žižek  (or, for that matter, Jackson, de Man, Stonum, and Cameron)  are skeptical of what they perceive to be a tendency to make  ethics subservient to (or coequivalent with) the drive for epis- temological mastery. But after making this powerful critique,  such contemporary post-Romantic thinkers leave us with the  unsatisfying impression, even amid hopes for a radical “hos- pitality” (Derrida) or “alternative communities” (Žižek), that  knowing—and especially knowing other humans—can consist  only of acknowledging limits to knowing (to use a Cavellian  phrasing), a conclusion that does not endorse Romanticism  but nevertheless seems resigned to its persistence.21 Dickinson also seems resigned to the limits of Romanticism  at times during 1862–1863. “We learned the Whole of Love –”  21 Eerily echoing Dickinson’s “The Tint I cannot take – is best –,” Derrida’s late  work on hospitality claims that we must undo “the violence of the taking [prendre]  as comprehending [comprendre],” in favor of a stance that “becomes hospitable to its  other, to an other than itself that is no longer its other. . . . to an other that is not mine”  (Jacques Derrida, “Hostipitality” (1997), trans. Gil anidjar, in Derrida, Acts of Religion,  ed. anidjar [new york and London: Routledge, 2002], pp. 362–63). at the moment  when something (or someone) becomes the object of one’s subjectivity, we feel the  need to take or possess, leading Derrida to wonder whether “hospitality doesn’t con- sist in suspending language . . . and even the address to the other,” a deeply limited  view of social relations ( Jacques Derrida, “Step of Hospitality/no Hospitality” (1996),  in anne Dufourmantelle and Jacques Derrida, Of Hospitality: Anne Dufourmantelle in- vites Jacques Derrida to Respond, trans. Rachel Bowlby [Stanford: Stanford univ. Press,  2000], p. 135). Though Slavoj Žižek criticizes Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas for of- fering only an “abyss of . . . impenetrable Otherness,” in place of a “‘love for one’s  neighbor,’” Žižek defines his Lacanian version of love in hardly more interactive terms  as an “incompleteness,” an ignorance that acknowledges, “I am also nothing, but, as it  were, a nothing humbly aware of itself, a nothing paradoxically made rich through  the very awareness of its lack” (Slavoj Žižek, The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core  of Christianity [Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2003], pp. 138, 115). Like Derrida, Žižek  recommends a teleological suspension of the ethical, an “uncoupling” or an “unplug- ging,” in order “to disengage ourselves from the inertia that constrains us to identify  with the particular order that we were born into.” But even as he hopes for “alternative  communit[ies],” no clear social vision emerges (Slavoj Žižek, The Fragile Absolute, or,  Why Is the Christian Legacy Worth Fighting For? [new york and London: Verso, 2000], pp.  127, 128–29, 130). See also Stanley Cavell, The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism,  Morality, and Tragedy [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979], pp. 428ff.

Like the poem  itself, the lovers fail “to expound / What neither – understood –”  (ll. 9–10). Such a poem makes one wonder whether Christopher  Benfey, applying the work of Stanley Cavell, is right to claim  that Dickinson seeks “some other mode of relation” but never  describes it beyond a vague appeal for “radical acceptance” or  a “giving place” to otherness (Emily Dickinson and the Problem of  Others, pp. 109, 113, 115). yet we have seen that Dickinson at  her most ambitious, unlike contemporary late-Romantic think- ers, rejects the terms of the conflictual, Romantic paradigm.  She shows in poems like “The Tint I cannot take – is best –”  how the Romantic narrative presumes possessiveness to be more  inevitable than it need be, curtailing our ability to theorize soci- ality. and in making a deeper critique than those of her fellow  post-Romantic thinkers, she also implicitly takes up a greater  burden. In order to explore new, non-conflictual  modes of social relation outside of the Romantic model of  sublimation, Dickinson must embed within the lyric a non- possessive subjectivity capable of fostering a sustained mutual- ity. During 1862–1863 she most fervently pursues this goal in  “There came a Day at Summer’s full”: There came a Day at Summer’s full, Entirely for me – I thought that such were for the Saints, Where Resurrections – be – The Sun, as common, went abroad, The flowers, accustomed, blew, as if no soul the solstice passed That maketh all things new – The time was scarce profaned, by speech – The symbol of a word Was needless, as at Sacrament, The Wardrobe, of our Lord – NCL6501_02.indd   58 6/8/10   12:13:15 PM </page> <page sequence="22"> dickinson’s lyric sociality 59 Each was to each The Sealed Church, Permitted to commune this – time – Lest we too awkward show at supper of the Lamb.

Ruth Miller and Judith Farr see it as an act of spiritual com- mitment.22 William H. Shurr argues that Dickinson actually  considered herself to be married in this world and finds in  the poem a “movement. . . [contrasting] marriage here on  earth to the new Marriage in heaven.”23 Vivian R. Pollak as- sociates the poem with a group of works that link “male sexual  power with violence” and “female sexuality with masochism,” a  “hierarch[y] . . . extinguished” in this poem only in a “demo- cratic heavenly utopia.”24 Such readings, however, tend to downplay several of the  oddest and most important features of the poem: first, it is cru- cial to recognize that the poem begins with a subject reveling,  if not in self-absorption, then at least in an idealized solitude  (“Entirely for me –”); second, the gradual shift to the plural  22  See Miller, The Poetry of Emily Dickinson (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan univ.

This last point is crucial and is underlined by the work’s textual  history. The poem first appears, as only a four-line fragment, in  a letter to Dickinson’s friend and former pastor Edward Dwight  on 2 January 1862 (L246; in Letters, II, 389–90). Dwight had  recently lost his wife, and the letter serves as a condolence com- memorating their happy marriage. Dickinson closes the letter  with a slightly altered version of the final stanza of “There came  a Day at Summer’s full,” indicating that she did not principally  associate the poem with a regret-laden, autobiographical event  and then a perfected heavenly vision, but with the development  of a lasting, selfless relationship in the here and now.25 While the poem’s overall trajectory is from “me” to “we,”  and particularly a “we” of equals, the first six lines of the poem  give absolutely no indication of two individuals. The day is “En- tirely for me –,” and the speaker identifies this apparently bliss- ful solitariness with absolute fulfillment, like a saint’s reward in  Heaven (l. 4). But with the second stanza, Dickinson makes an  extraordinarily subtle turn. after emphasizing to the point of  exaggeration how ordinary the day has been, something simul- taneously understated and overwhelming happens amid this  solitude: The Sun, as common, went abroad, The flowers, accustomed, blew, as if no soul the solstice passed That maketh all things new –          (ll. 5–8) Read in the context of the first stanza, these lines seem to say  that all is “common,” that the speaker’s day has “passed” in an  “accustomed,” solitary way. But Dickinson’s qualifying “as if”  indicates that the day in fact included an encounter with the  25 The slightly altered version: “Sufficient troth – that she will rise –/ Deposed – at  last – the Grave – / To that new fondness – / Justified – by Calvaries of love – ” (Poems, I,  343–44).

But why was so remarkable a visitor ini- tially unknowable?26 The next stanzas show how this odd encounter sets the  stage for a new kind of sociality. For this “soul” approaches the  speaker in an unexpected manner. He/she comes without any  possessive intentions, as if he/she had arrived at the same con- clusions as the speaker of “The Tint I cannot take – is best – ”  Thus they need not follow the Romantic narrative of sublima- tion; they are free to invent a more mutual form of sociality.  The strange near-speechlessness underscores the irruptive  nature of the encounter, but this meeting is not traumatic.  For the relationship inaugurated here is sacramental, in the  sense that the Eucharist connotes less a repeated liturgy than  an affirmation of a shared, deeper bond and commitment to  follow in the self-sacrificial example of Christ. We are told  that “Each was to each The Sealed Church.” The phrasing is  crucial, for only this pronominal description preserves the  balance between the parties, making it clear that they come  to approach each other equally as agents and yet, almost para- doxically, place this agency at the service of the other, permit- ting them to “commune.” Having left behind the poem’s initial  idealizing of solitude, the speaker welcomes the approaching  other. The non-possessive encounter has made reciprocation  and genuine mutuality possible. Each now provides for the  other a place of security and solace. Dickinson’s key insight in this poem, however, lies in her  recognition that a communion defined by a mutual withdrawal  from the world (“Each was to each The Sealed Church”) is  26 The version found in Fascicle 13 replaces this line with: “While our two Souls  that Solstice passed –” (Poems, I, 345). When Dickinson distributed copies to Sue and to  Higginson, she chose the more subtle phrasing, perhaps forcing them to take particular  care in how they understood the relationship depicted in the poem.

Stanzas five  and six explain this logic. We are first given an image of the  lovers physically separating. Though it is time itself that “slid  fast” and is “Clutched tight, by greedy hands –,” it is hard not  to read such words as also describing the lovers embracing be- fore they part on their boats “Bound to opposing lands –.” The  sixth stanza then presents a very different metaphor that clari- fies the kind of distance separating the lovers: “Each bound the  Other’s Crucifix –.” although this phrasing echoes the earlier  description of their relationship, “Each was to each The Sealed  Church,” and similarly balances the partners’ positions, it also  suggests a distinct development of their relationship. While the  earlier description emphasized the need to welcome the other  and to be that person’s refuge, it also connoted a set-apart  micro-community, perhaps an echo of the Calvinist belief in  the Elect, the chosen few granted salvation. The latter image  (“Each bound the Other’s Crucifix –”), however, shows Dick- inson reenvisioning the implications of this doctrine of salva- tion, which she would have known from her youth. Though she  imagines herself in other poems as a seemingly crucified Christ- figure (e.g., “Title divine – is mine!” [F194], Poems, I, 228–29),  here she offers as an image of sociality not a violent depiction  of mutual crucifixion, but a picture of people helping each  other to carry their crosses. This image is not representative of  merely a personal favor for an intimate friend or lover. They  are helping each other reenter the world out of a mutual ac- knowledgment of an ethical accountability for what is outside  of their own comfortably “Sealed Church.” For a crucifix in the  biblical story of Christ’s death is not primarily emblematic of a  privately shared burden but of a public, self-sacrificial responsi- bility. This transition from self-satisfaction to self-sacrifice does  not suggest the dissolution of their relationship but instead a  necessary extension beyond their earlier insularity. It serves as  the “Bond” that signals the consummation of their relationship,  their betrothal (“Sufficient Troth”) now and in the hereafter. “There came a Day at Summer’s full” acknowledges that this  transition is not without cost.

Dickinson’s extensive  1862–1863 exploration of sociality, however, reveals that fol- lowing the Romantic paradigm is also not without risks. These  poems expose a striking irony. The Romantic theory of the self,  reflecting the revolutionary era’s optimism that conflict could  yield greater liberty, in fact, yielded the postmodern dead-end  characterized by the ability to imagine conflict endlessly, with  little hope for liberation.27 Dickinson anticipates this impasse.  For we are never more “Cheated” (to use the terminology of  “The Tint I cannot take”) than when we are caught within a  paradigm of subjectivity driven by either expansive possessive- ness or by so great a fear of this possessiveness that it becomes  theoretically impossible to conceptualize more positive forms  of sociality. Dickinson rejects this dichotomy that has defined  post-Romantic thinking and, instead, proposes in poems like  “There came a Day at Summer’s full” and “The tint I cannot  take – is best –” a pacifistic stance that is anything but passive.  Such poems show how a ceding of the possessive urge to mas- ter otherness does not commit one to a perpetual moment of  hesitation but instead opens space for intersubjective improvi- sation otherwise foreclosed by the sublimation narrative. They  illustrate how many of the features that define Dickinson’s  distinctive lyric signature—her pronominal arrangements, im- age sequences, and syntactical design—not coincidentally are  necessary tools for transforming the lyric into a genre capable  of expressing a non-possessive subjectivity and thus fostering  the possibility of pursuing a more genuine mutuality. By reject- ing not just the Romantic narrative of sublimation, but also  the need for having a standardized narrative for how a subject  engages otherness, Dickinson argues that we regain a sense of  agency that is lost if we presume the Romantic narrative, and re- gain as well an appreciation for the responsibility to formulate  27  For a remarkable exploration of the revolutionary era’s influence on Romanti- cism, see Leon Chai, Romantic Theory: Forms of Reflexivity in the Revolutionary Era (Bal- timore: Johns Hopkins univ.

New Mexico State University abstract Ryan Cull, “Beyond the Cheated Eye: Dickinson’s Lyric Sociality”  (pp. 38–64) During the past generation, Dickinson scholarship has shown how historicist and print- culture methodologies can illuminate the social nexus of even a notoriously reticent  figure. It has also had a broader impact on how we think about lyric poetry in general.  For Emily Dickinson’s experiments with dual authorship, hybrid-collage forms, and the  blurring of stylistic and formal lines between poem and letter indicate the social embed- dedness of what critics often still consider a private genre. This essay blends these two  lines of thought in order to consider the lyric (and here, especially, Dickinson’s lyrics)  not only as a socio-historically embedded form but also as a form that may have applica- tion to our theorizing of the social. The essay argues that in a sequence of poems and  letters in the period from 1862 to 1863 Dickinson identifies a possessiveness at the heart  of the lyrical subjectivity that poisons social relations and stands as the most pervasive  legacy of Romanticism. The essay then shows how Dickinson criticism, which can serve  as a microcosm of critical trends in general, critiques but never casts aside this post- Romantic subjectivity that still limits our social theorizing. Then it shows how Dickinson  seeks to do just this, to present within her lyrics an alternative poetic subjectivity that  makes possible a revolutionary, pacifistic (though not passive) form of social relation.
