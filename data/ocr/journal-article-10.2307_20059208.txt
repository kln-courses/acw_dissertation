<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studia Isl?mica, 2004 The faith of pharaoh: A Disputed Question in Islamic Theology The question of the faith of Pharaoh is one of a number of disputed questions that occupied the learned in the later Islamic scholastic tradi tion.1 Such questions were often sparked by a controversial passage, or even a single phrase, in the work of some eminent authority after which critics or defenders of the opinion lined up to deliver responses or put their arguments in brief treatises (rasa'il). These sometimes became set questions, repeated over generations; the dispute which I examine here extended, with gaps, over some five hundred years. Though at times the issues may appear to be minor, and the arguments undistinguished, repu tations could be enhanced or damaged depending upon the responses. One later chronicler of the present dispute admonished potential dis putants not to broach such questions for the wrong reasons; thus, the Ottoman polymath Ha? Khahfah (K?tib Cheleb?, d. 1068/1657): "Be not eager to recount the controversies described in this book, and similar subtleties, for the sake of obtaining a larger audience and becoming well known."2 But beyond ambition and personal prestige, other larger and still unresolved questions often underlay these seemingly lesser topics. 1.

In fact, they often led back to certain insoluble theological problems that had haunted discussion since at least the second/eighth century, e.g., the definition, and boundaries, of faith; predestination and free will; the nature of God's goodness, and the like. No matter how settled such grand issues might have seemed, they kept springing back to life, sometimes covertly, at others with startling gusto. In any case, the ferocity of certain disputants towards their opponents indi cates that these remained exasperating issues (even if the intensity of the vituperation tends to rise as the arguments weaken). Terms of abuse such as "ranting fanatic," "feeble-minded" and "mentally unbalanced," as well as "infidel" and "heretic," are not uncommon and seem to exceed the customary level of ad hominem contumely. In the present debate, for example, the Shaykhi master Ahmad ibn Zayn al-Din al-Ahsai (d. 1241/1826) lambasted Ibn al-Arabi with such epithets as "Murderer of Religion" {murmt al-d?n, a play on his honorific title "Reviver of Religion" or muhyi al-diii) and "The Supremely Moronic Shaykh" {al-shaykh al-ahmaq instead of the usual al-shaykh al-akbar, "The Greatest Shaykh").4 But it could be more dangerous to attack Ibn al-'Arabi than to defend him; in Aleppo, in 1535, one Muhammad al-Fal?ji was reportedly condemned to death for accusing al-Shaykh al-Akbar of heresy.5 3.

Khal?fahs aforementioned treatment (which offers an overview of the controversy), certain of these persis tent debates are treated alongside such legal questions as the lawfulness of coffee and tobacco, the cursing of Yazid, the practice of shaking hands or the recurrent discussions of pilgrimages to tombs or the sta tus of the supererogatory prayers in the month of Rajab. But the topics went beyond the legalistic into shadier matters: the status of the parents of the Prophet, for example, or the dilemmas engendered by the age-old problem of theodicy, the latter of which I have dealt with in detail elsewhere. The problem of the faith of Pharaoh offers a good instance of a dispute that seems to be centered on lesser issues (e.g., the exact status of Ibn al-'Arabi) and yet reveals unexpected intricacies.6 II In Islamic tradition Pharaoh, the "Pharaoh of Moses" {Fir awn Musa), is the epitome of the swaggering and arrogant despot; and yet, Pharaoh is not merely a despot. He embodies blasphemous pretension to divinity. Does he not exclaim in the Quran (79:24): "I am your Lord most high" {an? rabbukum al-dl?)?7 If only for this reason, there clings 6. For earlier treatments of this question, see Denis Gril, "Le personnage coranique de Pharaon d'apr?s l'interpr?tation d'Ibn 'Arab?," Annales islamo logiques XIV (1978), pp. 37-57; and the shorter study by Carl W. Ernst, "Controversies over Ibn al-'Arab? s Fus?s : The Faith of Pharaoh," Islamic Culture 59 (1985), pp. 259-266; for a useful overview of several manuscripts devoted to the question, see Ernst, p. 260, note 5. A more recent discussion is in Alexander D. Knysh, Ibn 'Arab? in the Later Islamic Tradition (Albany, 1999), pp. 158-165. On the figure of Pharaoh, see also A.J. Wensinck and G. Vajda, "Fir'awn," in El {2d ed.), II: 917-918. In this article I draw largely on manuscripts held in the Princeton University Library, for which see Rudolf Mach, Catalogue of Arabic Manuscripts (Yahuda Section) in the Garrett Collec tion (Princeton, 1977), p. 186. 7. Not all theologians understood the verse this way. The early theologian al Q?sim ibn Ibrahim (169/785-246/860), later claimed as a Zaydi imam, in his Kitab al-da?l al-kab?r denies that the offending statement involves a claim to divinity by Pharaoh; he states, "Pharaoh maintained something else concern ing his rule over his equals. He did not maintain that he created them. If he had maintained that, it would have been an abominable lie. Pharaohs 7</page><page sequence="4">Eric ORMSBY about the figure of Pharaoh, even today, a particular aura of abhor rence.8 (For instance, the prime assassin of Anwar al-Sadat, in 1981, the young Egyptian lieutenant Khalid Istanbuli declared, "I shot the Pharaoh."9) Ibn al-'Arabi in his al-Futthat al-Makkiyah (written before the Fus us) places Pharaoh among the "four groups of the damned" who will remain eternally in hell and this, not solely because Pharaoh was "haughty" {mutakabbir) but because he entertained pretensions to divinity {iddda al-rubub?yah li-nafiihi wa-naphcian Alt?lo).10 In keeping with his colossal hubris, Pharaoh typifies intransigent unbelief as well. He remains the individual who will not believe even if God Himself offers him belief. In a certain sense, of course, belief is not possible for Pharaoh; indeed, his acceptance of belief would have entailed grave the ological difficulties. As the theologian al-M?turidi (d. 333/944) expressed it, "If Pharaoh had been able to believe, he would have been able to invalidate Gods [fore]-knowledge. This is so of Pharaoh and of everyone who in Gods knowledge will not believe."11 This is the first of the dilemmas: If God knows from all eternity that Pharaoh will not believe, then his change of heart becomes impossible, for such a subsequent conversion would impugn divine omniscience; statement 'I am your highest Lord' means only 'I am your master and king,' not what Moses had said. He did not mean to say 'I am your Lord and Cre ator,' nor...'I am your God and Provider.' ... Pharaoh said I am your lord and king, and he did not maintain that he was their creator and director, for he felt himself too small and weak to make such a pretense."

The word mutakabbir has dual denotation: when it applies to God (as in Qur. 59:23 and elsewhere), it means "sublime, mighty, great," but if applied to creatures, denotes "conceited" or "haughty" (as in Qur. 7:13, where God applies it to Iblis); cf.

Kholeif (Beirut, 1970), p. 274. 8</page><page sequence="5">The faith ofpharaoh : A disputated Question in Islamic Theology but if his acceptance of belief is impossible, how can Pharaoh be consi dered responsible for his unbelief? If God does not know from all eter nity that Pharaoh will not believe, then His knowledge is imperfect and, even worse, dependent somehow upon a contingent thing: Pharaohs human heart. If He knows, however, that Pharaoh will not believe, is His knowledge a factor in Pharaohs unbelief? Is it God s foreknowledge that in fact necessitates and so causes Pharaohs unbelief? This is, of course, the problem, familiar enough from comparable Western debates, of whether divine foreknowledge is itself causative. Underneath such logi cal and philosophical concerns lurks the more difficult-indeed, the excruciating-theological problem of why God singles some out for belief and subsequent salvation and others for unbelief and subsequent damna tion. What kind of God condemns those whom He Himself has made as they are? But the dilemma is even acuter, for the scriptures make plain that God Himself hardens Pharaohs heart. This is true in the Hebrew Bible, as well as in its translations into the Septuagint and Vulgate, and in the Quran itself.12 In the Qur an (10:88), Moses asks God to "harden the hearts" {washdud*ata qul?bihim) of the Egyptians: 'Our Lord, oblite rate their possessions and harden their hearts so that they do not believe...' God obligingly answers, Your prayer is answered.' In the next verse (10:89) occurs the much-disputed passage in question: And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea; and Pharaoh and his hosts followed them insolently and impetuously till, when the drown ing overtook him, he said, 'I believe that there is no god but He in whom the Children of Israel believe; I am of those that surrender.'13 The question prompted by these verses, for most commentators, is whether Pharaohs apparent profession of faith is genuine; and, if so, whether God accepted it and so saved him. The prevailing view, perhaps best epitomized by the Asharite theologian and commentator 12. See Exodus 14:8: wa-yekhazzeq Adonai et-lev Far oh; the Vulgate renders the passage: induravitque Dominus cor Pharaonis. 13. The crucial final phrase - wa-an? min al-muslim?n ("And I am among those that surrender," literally, "the Muslims") - is in some ways the crux of the passage. For the translation, see A. J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted (New York, 1967), p. 235. 9</page><page sequence="6">Eric ORMSBY Fakhr al-D?n al-R?zi (d. 606/1209) in his commentary on this verse, is that Pharaoh did not truly believe and was not saved, his last words notwithstanding. According to al-R?zi, a man cannot articulate the profession of faith at the moment of drowning if only for the "techni cal" reason that his own death-rattle in his throat prevents him; this is in keeping too with the Qur'?nic censure of death-bed repentance.14 Yet another problem arises: Why then does God recount in the Qur'?n what Pharaoh said? For al-R?zi, this is done not to exculpate Pharaoh but to affirm the validity of "internal speech" {al-kalam bi-?-nafi) as opposed to "voiced speech" {al-kal?m bi'1-lis?n); only internal speech is genuine {haqiqi). In other words, by giving us Pharaoh's last utterances, God is merely illustrating the reality of mental discourse. Articulate speech may not be possible at the moment of death but mental dis course is: "It is possible that God is demonstrating through this verse the existence of mental discourse," for it has been proved, and proved apodictically, that Pharaoh "did not say this with his tongue."15 For al-R?zi, Pharaohs words were invalid for a number of reasons. To profess belief in the face of impending punishment nullifies the profession. Even worse, he continues, Pharaoh was only practising taqhd, slavish adherence to imposed belief, and this too compromised his profession; did he not say, after all, "I believe that there is no God but He in whom the Children of Israel believe?" He is thus merely parroting what he has heard the Israelites say, not what he himself sin cerely believes. Al-R?zi further notes that "in certain books" he has read that the Israelites after they traversed the Red Sea began worship ping "a calf" and so when Pharaoh mimes Israelite beliefs, it is only the calf that he is worshipping, not the true God.16 Moreover, the Israelites were much given to anthropomorphism {tasbbib) and corpo real ism {tajsim); thus, they believed that God was incarnate in the body of the calf and it is to this corporeal divinity that Pharaoh pro fesses his belief. Another disqualifying reason is that Pharaoh says nothing about the Prophet Muhammad in his shab?dah, as is required, and this too demonstrates the invalidity of his belief.17 14. Cf. Qur. 4:18 (trans. Dawood): "But He will not forgive those who do evil and, when death comes to them, say: 'Now we repent!'" 15. Al-R?zi, Ma??h al-ghayb (Cairo, 1357/1938), vol. 17, p. 153ff. 16. This is of course the golden calf of Exodus 32. 17. Al-R?zi, op.cit., p. 155. 10</page><page sequence="7">The faith ofpharaoh : A disputated Question in Islamic Theology II It was therefore disturbing to more traditional sensibilities when the great Andalusian master Muhyi al-Din Ibn al-Arab? (d. 638/1240) stated in his Fus?s al-hikam that God had granted Pharaoh belief and that he had died as a believer, pure and cleansed of his sins: Pharaoh's consolation was in the faith God endowed him with when he was drowned. God took him to Himself spotless, pure and untainted by any defilement, because He seized him at the moment of belief, before he could commit any sin, since submission [to God: islam] extirpates all that has occurred before. God made him a sign of His lovingkindness to whomever He wishes, so that no one may despair of the mercy of God, For indeed, no one but despairing folk despairs of the spirit of God (12:87). Had Pharaoh been despairing, he would not have hastened to believe.18 Ibn al-Arabis views were controversial to many not simply because of what he said but because it was he who said it. Indeed, another concurrent late scholastic debate centered on Ibn al-Arab? s own status as a believer or kafir, H?jj? Khal?fah devotes a separate chapter to it in Mimn al-haqq and Jal?l al-D?n al-Suyut?, and others, hotly engaged in it.19 To be sure, this is hardly the most outrageous of Ibn al-Arabis opinions or scriptural interpretations (though Ibn 18.

'Anqi ' mugh?b&gt; see now Gerald T. Elmore, Islamic Sainthood in the Fullness of Time (Leiden, 1999), pp. 487-488 and 560. In his K al-isfir an nat?'j al-as?r, Ibn al-'Arabi makes two veiled ref erences to Pharaoh which are clearly condemnatory; cf. the text and translation in Le d?voilement des effets du voyage (?d. Denis Gril; Paris, 1994), pp. 2 and 73 74; in the latter passage Pharaoh is termed "the enemy of religion" ('ad? al-d?n). 19. See, among several possible examples, fal?lal-Dtn alSuy?t? (ed./tr. E. M. Sartain; Cambridge, 1975), vol. 1, p. 55. Al-Suy?t? defended Ibn al-Arab? as a saint, even though, like Ibn Taymiyah, he condemned the practitioners of hul&gt;l and ittihid uncompromisingly. I suspect that in his treatise entitled Tanb?at al-ghabi bi-tabriat Ibn Arat?, he discusses our question but I have not had access to the manuscript which is in the Egyptian National Library {Maja mif 182). Note that a comparable debate involved the reputation of the great mystical poet Ibn al-Firi\ and involved several of the same disputants. 11</page><page sequence="8">Eric ORMSBY Taym?yah, not surprisingly, thought so20); compared to other passages of the Fus?sy these comments are even rather tame. Still, according to H?jji Khalifah, people "swarmed about [Ibn al- Arab? s] head like ants and hornets" because of this passage.21 Perhaps our issue was of unusual interest because it concerned legiti macy of belief, an issue that had been strenuously debated from the earli est period.22 If the blasphemous and despotic Pharaoh might be welcomed even in extremis into the community of believers, who could be excluded? Of course, the ostensible issue may have concealed another, even thornier problem; thus, one of Ibn al-'Arab? s chief defenders, the philosopher Jal?l al-Din al-Dawwani (d. 907/1501), and others, would claim that the real issue was the breadth of the divine mercy which excludes no one who sin cerely repents. But the anti-nominalistic implications of the passage were clear. For as Ali ibn Sultan Muhammad al-Q?ri al-Haraw? (d. 1014/1605), al-Daww?n?s most implacable critic, would object, belief has juridical conditions and obligations that must be observed; in addi tion, as he notes in an access of legalistic indignation, Pharaohs profession of faith was not merely insincere but worse, he could not complete the full shah?dah since he nowhere proclaims his belief in the prophethood of Muhammad. Therefore, even if he might have been saved by a mere ver bal profession, this incompleteness would have invalidated it.23 20. As paraphrased in Chodkiewicz, op.cit., pp. 102-103: ?

Thus, according to the much-revered Ibn Abb?s (d. 68/686), as reported by Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597/1200), "God did not accept his faith in the face of punishment."24 And in his tafir the Mu' tazilite commentator al-Zamakhshari (d. 538/1144) interrogates Pharaoh harshly and says, "Do you believe in the Last Judgement at the moment when you are compelled, when drowning has overtaken you, and you despair for yourself?"25 The consensus here was that Pharaoh has simply wanted to save his skin at the last possible moment. His belief was the belief of desperation (?man al-yas) and as such, unacceptable.26 Perhaps there was, even so, a vague uneasiness in some of these tradi tional interpretations. To hear words of faith from the mouth of such a malefactor was disturbing. According to some traditions, the angel Gabriel himself stopped up Pharaohs mouth with slime and mud from the sea floor to prevent him from completing his profession; for had he completed it, "four hundred years of sinful living and unbelief would have been forgiven him".27 According to other traditions, Gabriel is anxious to shut Pharaohs mouth before Gods compassion can "overtake" him, as though a completed shah?dah would irresistibly prompt divine mercy. Ill Ibn al-Arab? s position was not without precedent. The Sufi tradi tion had embellished the figure of Pharaoh with provocative compli cations. While most Sufis from the earliest period agreed that Pharaoh 24. Ibn al-Jaw?, Zadal-mair? 'ihn al-tafir (Damascus &amp; Beirut, 1965), vol. 4, p. 59. 25. Al-Kashsh?f (ed. Lees), vol. 1, p. 596. 26. Such is the form of belief that unbelievers will strive after on the Day of Judgement and is not acceptable; cf. al-Daww?n?, Ris?lat innn Fir awn, Yahuda Arabic ms. 2180/3, fol. 57b. Earlier, the great historian and commen tator al-&gt;abari had considered Pharaohs shahidah a statement made under duress (ilj?') and thus invalid; cf.

Pharaoh was the unwitting enunciator of a secret truth, revealed only to him. In our later dispute this traditional Sufi conception reappears and undergoes development. One of Ibn al-Arab? s defenders, whom we know only as Akmal al-Din, argued that Pharaohs final acceptance of faith signi fied a reconciliation of the disparity between his outer and illusory grandeur and his inner and true lowliness and, furthermore, that belief worked within him continually like "a leaven" {khamirab) until equilibrium was attained at the instant of death.28 In certain Sufi traditions, the figure of Pharaoh - in this like the fig ure of Iblis - was considerably more nuanced. The early Sufi Yahy? ibn Mu'adh (d. 258/872) might berate those who lived too luxuriously by exclaiming, "Your faces are pharaonic, your morals satanic!"29 and view Pharaoh as only an object lesson for believers: If God was patient and longsuffering with regard to Pharaoh, who arrogated Gods position to himself, how much the more so will He be mild and indulgent to those who recognize His lordship?30 Other Sufis were subtler. For Sahl al-Tus tari (d. 283/896), for example, Pharaohs blasphemous utterance "I am your Lord most high!" expresses the "secret of the soul." He explains: "Know that the soul has a secret. That secret did not become manifest to any of His creatures save to Pharaoh when he said, 'I am your Lord most high'."31 In this view, Pharaoh speaks a hidden truth but for the wrong reason; or, as G. B?wering puts it, "Firaun is...the prototype of a man who, in his claim to divinity, gives expression to the secret of the 28. Akmal al-D?n, Ris?lattn?n Fir awn, Yahuda Arabic ms.

Hamid al-Ghaz?l? (d. 505/1111), Pharaoh is sometimes evoked as the epitome of the human self; prone to consider itself virtually autonomous and self-subsistent, the self usurps God s prerogatives if it is not tamed and disciplined.33 Ibn al-Arab? himself puts this aspect of the matter suc cinctly when he writes, "God knows that when He creates man, he claims divinity and says 1 am your Lord the most high!' and yet, His creation of man must come to pass because of Gods foreknowledge."34 But Ibn al-Arabis true precursor is al-Hall?j (executed 309/933). Indeed, for al-Hall?j, Pharaoh (like Iblis) represents a particular form of fut?wah or manly virtue, and his refusal to acknowledge the Prophet Muhammad (like the refusal of Iblis to bow down before Adam) is seen as the essence of his fut?wah.35 There is an obvious affi nity between Pharaohs declaration of divinity and such Hall?jian sha^h?y?t as "I am the Truth" (i.e., God: ana al-haqq). This affinity was often noted and both admirers and detractors of al-Hall?j commented upon it.36 Among these were some who sought to defend Ibn al-Arab? by neu tralizing objections to his words.

Al K?sh?ni clearly wishes to support Ibn al-Arab? while simultaneously blunting the objections of his critics. Scripture and logic prove, he argues, that Pharaohs last-minute belief was both sincere and accepted. But his profession of faith saved him merely from "doctrinal defile ment" {khubth ?tiq?c?) and did not absolve him of the sins he had committed towards his fellow man.37 As a result, his faith was accept able but he was consigned to hell anyway. What, then, was the advan tage of his faith? Only the certain knowledge that he will not remain eternally in hell. Others, to be sure, defended Ibn al-Arab? without attempting to compromise his position. The philosopher Jal?l al-D?n al-Daww?n? (d. 907/1501), best known perhaps as the author of the Akhl?q-ijal??, was willing to entertain bolder notions. For him, repentance, and repentance alone, is the crucial element. God accepts repentance whenever it occurs and Pharaoh both repented and believed. Al Dawwini goes so far as to restate Pharaohs profession of faith in far more explicit terms, thus: "I affirm and state as a certainty that there is not any true object of worship in existence other than God in whom the Children of Israel believe... He is truly to be worshipped."38 And he observes ? the argument may be feeble but the attempt is gallant ? that Pharaoh must be sincere since his are hardly words a man might utter while drowning. Al-Daww?n? is even willing to venture a radical re-interpretation of Qur. 10:91, the verse that immediately fol lows Pharaoh's outcry and which is usually seen as sealing his condem nation. In it Gabriel replies to Pharaoh, "What! Now? When before you rebelled and were among the evildoers?" By a complicated, and not very convincing, sleight of grammatical legerdemain, al-Daww?n? labours to show that the verse should be read as though it meant, "You have not sinned, O Pharaoh! Now your belief has uprooted your sin!" 37. K?sh?ni, Sharh Fus?s al-hikam (Cairo, 1321), p. 254. Cf. GAL SIL262; SU, 280, and for this work, S I:793(c).

Khal?fah might praise al-Dawwin? s treatise as logical proof of Ibn al-Arab? s position but others were not so easily impressed. Indeed, it was al-Daww?n? s misfortune to arouse the ire of the formi dable 17th-century theologian Ali al-Q?r? al-Haraw? (d. 1014/1605) who composed a stinging rebuttal. In his hostile commentary, which twines around al-Daww?n? s text with a python grip, al-Harawi lets no lapse of logic, doctrine, or grammar pass unnoticed; and he delights in gibes, sarcastic asides, and downright insults, calling his long-dead victim both feeble-minded and ignorant. Though himself an admirer of Ibn al-'Arabi, his position is radically opposed to al-Daww?n? s. While the latter stresses the efficacy of repentance and the breadth of the divine compassion, al-Haraw? places unyielding insistence on the eternal decree of God. In his view, Moses and Aaron were blessed with felicity while still in their fathers loins while Pharaoh even in his mother s womb had already been predestined to misery. Pharaohs repentance was false, his apparent belief coerced. God saved Pharaohs drowned body as a physical sign of his condemnation (Qur. 10:92). This is a mock deliverance, a sort of bitter parody of genuine redemp tion; as al-Harawi puts it, "fictitious deliverance is conformable with compelled belief."39 Al-Daww?n? opens his treatise on the question with a frank admis sion that his purpose in writing is to refute those who accuse the "Great est Shaykh" of kufr.40 He notes further that even among scholars there is divergence of opinion on the faith of Pharaoh. There are, first, those who consider him an unbeliever. At the opposite extreme are those who con sider him a believer. But for al-Daww?n? the truth seems obvious: "The truth is that the illustrious verse clearly states belief without any hin drance either explicitly or implicitly."41 Here al-Daww?n? attempts the unequivocal rewording of Pharaohs outcry, already noted above. But he goes further to assert that "whoever has a healthy nature and a sound mind knows that [Pharaoh] made this statement [of belief] only in the 39.

This being so, the meaning of the Shaykh s statement is that death "seized him at the instant of belief before any of his sins were written down, for he lived no longer after that [moment]. Submission {islam) cancels whatever preceded it in regard to the Creator, though not in regard to creatures."43 Moreover, God did this to make Pharaoh "a sign of His providence to whomsoever He will, so that no one might despair of the mercy of God."44 As we have seen, al-Daww?n? goes so far as to interpret the verse fol lowing Pharaohs profession in exactly the opposite way to its apparent meaning. For him the fact that Pharaoh is cursed does not in itself exclude him from the community of belief; indeed, he comes under the heading provided by the verse "except for him who repents and believes" (Qur. 19:60 and 25:70). Furthermore, it was drowning itself that was the "most painful torment" promised to Pharaoh, and not hell fire; after all, Pharaoh was actually hostile not to God but to Moses.45 In the conclusion of his little treatise, al-Daww?n? turns to a brief defense of Ibn al-Arab? against the charge of ilh?d. Those who so accuse him are marked by ignorance for "whoever does not know something denies it." These ignorant accusers do not understand the technical terminology {istil?h) of the Shaykh and so miss the obvious point of his comments. In his remarks Ibn al-'Arabi means to uphold the "vastness of Gods mercy". In fact, critics of the Shaykh, by deny ing this boundless compassion, "vex believers and frighten them into despair in God's spirit."46 In his hostile commentary on this, al-Q?r? al-Harawi, writing almost a century later, begins his attack with the unequivocal affir mation of predestination in the very hamdalah of his treatise: "Praise be to Him who grants felicity to him who is fortunate, even while still in the loins of his father, such as Moses and Aaron, and [praise 42.

Indeed, as Abu Hanifah himself pointed out with grim wit, there will no unbelievers in hell; by Judgement Day all will have resorted to the same despairing faith.50 Al-Harawis sharpest indignation is reserved for two points. First, he considers it a form of defamation that al-Daww?n? should make the scope of the divine mercy the focus of debate. In doing so, he casts aspersions on the integrity of the 'ulama Mt is, he charges, "a stupendous slander" and tantamount to accusing respectable savants of denying the divine compassion. But in such accusations al-Dawwini in fact commits kufir himself. And in any case, the controversial position is Ibn al-A.rab? s alone; it has no basis in tradition. Worse, an ignorant person hearing of this con troversy "thinks that this is the sort of disputed question such as took place between Ahl al-sunnah wa'l-jama ah and the Mu tazilah and those like them, or between the Hanafis and the Sh?fTis... whereas in fact they have left no trace or report of this in their writ ings."51 Al-Harawi thus wishes to deny the dispute the dignity of roots in the Islamic theological tradition, to treat it as a grotesque anomaly and nothing more. But this is a debaters trick. Indeed, it 47. Farr al-awn, Yahuda Arabic ms. 2181, fol. 305a. 48. Op.cit, fol. 306b, with apparent reference to Fut?h?t (bib 62). 49. Ibid. 50. Op.cit, fol. 310b. 51. Op.cit., fol. 306b. 19</page><page sequence="16">Eric Ormsby is partly because the topics, both tacit and expressed, had deep roots in the past that the controversy assumed such vehemence on both sides. Early on in his rebuttal, al-Harawi attempts to refute al-Daww?n? without, however, seeming to limit the divine mercy. Had God intended to demonstrate mercy by His treatment of Pharaoh, and had Pharaohs faith been sincere, God would have preserved him alive and not flung his naked body on the sea shore; but instead, God manifested the counterfeit nature of his faith.52 Against the claim that Pharaohs faith is proved by the fact that he alone of all his host was washed up on the shore, al-Harawi counters with his dictum, cited earlier, that this is merely "fictitious deliverance" as is appropriate for "compelled belief." God does not waste the rewards He reserves for those who perform good works on such as Pharaoh; true, sometimes the actions of unbe lievers take the form of the actions of believers, such as feeding the poor and helping the weak, but this does not entitle unbelievers to rewards.53 To the claim that Pharaoh believed "with his heart," al-Harawi responds that this too must be rejected "since what is in the heart is not knowable except to the Knower of the Invisible," i.e., God Himself.54 Had Pharaoh been saved from drowning, this would have proved that his faith was genuine. Instead, his body washed up so that his followers would not be misled into thinking that he had somehow escaped his fate. IV The best defender of Ibn al-Arab? is, not surprisingly, Ibn al-Arab? himself; and indeed, his chapter on Moses represents not merely an affirmation of Pharaohs faith but an anticipation of the arguments against it as well as a persuasive defence of his position within the con fines of his system. By and large his defenders drew on the arguments he devised, though often in considerably weakened form. It is notewor thy that his main arguments rest on a close and rather literal reading of the Qur'?nic text. Pharaoh was taken despite his faith but he had no 52. Op.cit., fol. 308a, line 6ff. 53.

Moreover, his drowned body is itself a sign of his salvation; in fact, "salvation encompassed him both perceptibly and conceptually."55 But on the most fundamental level, "though it is deeply implanted in the common people s minds that [Pharaoh] is lost, they have no explicit text on which they can lean to prove it." It is thus on the sacred text itself that Ibn al-Arab? rests and that text says nothing about the authenticity of Pharaohs faith or his ultimate destiny. Still, looking beyond this, and within his larger view, it is possible, I think, to under stand the mystical underpinnings of his position on Pharaoh. Ultimately, Moses and Pharaoh are one; they represent a "single essence" ?ayn w?hid).56 In a monistic world-view as radical as Ibn al Arabis, no genuine opposition or disharmony can endure; some reconciliation of contending contraries must occur for the unicity of being to remain intact. If the universe - indeed, if all being - represents the incessant self-disclosure of God in the process that Ibn al-Arab? (here following al-Ghaz?li and others) names tajallin, then even Pharaoh must in some way participate in this divine epiphany. He can be said to do so in at least two ways. First, like Moses, Pharaoh is a locus of man ifestation {madoar) 57 of the Divine Names, especially those linked with power, authority and wrath; indeed, there is some analogue, however pallid, with Gods authority in the regal authority Pharaoh wielded.58 Juridically, yes, Pharaoh is reprehensible but as a manifestation of Gods 55. The Arabic of the last phrase is hissan wa-manan. Cf. William C. Chittick, Imaginai Worlds: Ibn al-Arabi and the Problem of Religious Diversity (Albany, 1994), p. 74: '"Meaning (ma'ni) is a key term in dogmatic theology, Sufism, and literary theory. The Sufis typically identify it with the inner, invis ible reality of a thing, in contradistinction to its 'form' (s?rah). Hence, the Shaykh often identifies a things meaning with its immutable entity, the thing as known by God... More commonly, the Shaykh uses meaning as the oppo site of sense perception (hiss)." [his emphasis]. 56. Ibn al-Arabi, Fus?s, vol. 1, p. 209: wa'l-'ayn w?hid fa-kayfa furriqat? 57. This is Chitticks rendering of the term; cf. op.cit., p. 17f: "Ibn al-'Arab? explains that wuj&gt;d becomes manifest because God as Manifest displays Him self in a 'locus of manifestation (ma-har), which is the cosmos itself." 58. Ibn al-?Arabi, Fubl, vol. 1, p. 211: "Pharaohs saying 'I am your lord most high' is correct since even though he was the essence of God, his form belonged to Pharaoh. So he cut off hands and feet and crucified by virtue of the divine essence in him in a false form..." 21</page><page sequence="18">Eric Ormsby own nature he is not merely redeemable but good (though "good" and "bad" ultimately are irrelevant).59 Pharaoh must act as he does; this is his appointed role; he is part of that intrinsic polarity of the cosmos which is its very nature as the arena of God's self-disclosure.60 Moreover, Pharaoh is merely the transitory figment of that "fixed essence" ?ayn th?bii) ? or, to use Izutsu s formulation, that "permanent archetype"61 ? known as Pharaoh and which exists in the suprasensible, transcendent realm of the divine consciousness. From this perspective concerns over Pharaohs final status become meaningless: No malefactor, no sinner, will remain forever in hell. To posit an enduring hell is to compromise the "oneness of being" {ivah dat al-wuj?d) that is the raison d'?tre of Ihn al-Arab?'s system (though, as Hermann Landolt was the first to note,62 he nowhere employs that particular formulation). Even more pertinently, it is pointless to quar rel over whether Pharaoh acted on his own volition or was impelled by God; the question of free will, in such a monism, becomes irrele vant. Only God possesses genuine existence; all else is fictive, however 59. According to 'Af?f?'s commentary on the Fus?s, the question rests on the distinction (for which it is difficult to find exact equivalents in English) between "a matter of constituent existence" {amr takw?n?) dand a "matter of juridical obligation" {amr takUfi), "between which there is a significant gulf." In this light, Pharaoh was "obedient in an amr takw?n?) even if he had been disobedient in an amr takBfi, in Fus?s, vol. 2, p. 65. 60. Fus?s, vol. 1, p. 200; trans. Austin, p. 254 : ? This pairing is the polar ity inherent in all that is born or manifest from her [sc. Nature]. Similarly, the Being of God has a multiplicity and diversity of Names, because of what is manifest of Him in the Cosmos innately requires the realities of the Divine Names, so that by it [the cosmos] and by its Creator the unity of multiplic ity is confirmed. In respect to its essence it is single...but it is multiple in respect to the outer forms it bears within its essence...God is the theater of the forms of the Cosmos, notwithstanding His Unity". 61. Izutsu, op.cit., vol. 1, p. 163: "All men are just as they are...because they have been so determined by their own permanent archetypes from eternity. No one in the world, whether he be good or bad, a believer or a disbeliever, is against the Will of God' and therefore, "the distinction between good and bad is but an accidental matter." 62.

Landolt (Tehran, 1971), p. 100. 22</page><page sequence="19">The faith ofpharaoh : A disputated Question in Islamic Theology real it seem. And everything that appears to exist, exists as a revelation of God's nature. Indeed, creation betokens not the fashioning of dis tinct and autonomous entities but the gradual coming-to-conscious ness of all things as prompted by love. God Himself acts out of love and it is their nascent love that draws things from non-being into being.63 Being is itself a form of self-realization. From the divine per spective nothing changes when creatures assume existence. Neither Pharaoh nor anyone else can truly rebel against God; the very notion is ludicrous for all that is exists only insofar as it manifests God Him self and is a part of Him. For an Ash arite or other "orthodox" theolo gian, rebellion against God is meaningless because of God's unimag inable omnipotence; for Ibn al-Arabi and his followers, rebellion may be meaningful enough and may indeed be necessary (so that the divine attributes may be given full play), but is ultimately harmonized within the utter oneness of God which encompasses all polarities. The divine mercy {rahmalo), which Ibn al-Arabi's champions espouse in their defences of him reveals itself most fully in the confer ral of existence on creatures. Indeed, the divine name "the Merciful" is the most comprehensive of God's names and subsumes all the oth ers.64 Compassion is the very "breath of the Merciful" and it not only pities and absolves creation but is the instrument by which creatures are accorded the self-actualization that is being. When defenders such as al-Dawwini resort to the vast extent of the divine mercy they are not simply saying that God's mercy outstrips His wrath, as in the famous hadth qudsi.65 Rather, they are upholding a Weltanschauung 63. Cf. Ful&gt;l, vol. 1, p. 203, and Izutsu, op.cit., vol. 1, p. 131: "... the move ment which was the coming into existence of the world was a movement of Love. This is clearly indicated by the Apostle when he says (conveying God s own words): 'I was a hidden treasure, and I loved to be known.' If it were not for this love, the world would never have appeared in its concrete existence... the movement of the world toward existence was a movement of Love which brought it into existence (fa-k?nat al-harakah alian huya wuj?d al-'? lam harakat al-hubb)... And the world, on its part, loves to witness itself in exis tence as it used to witness itself in the state of archetypal repose." 64. Cf. Izutsu, op.cit., vol. 1, p. 101. Izutsus discussion of the Divine Mercy in Ibn al-'Arabi remains unsurpassed; see especially pp. 109-132 of the work cited. 65. Cf. Muslim, Sahth (Cairo, 1955-56), vol. 4, 2107ff. For a wider discus sion, see my Theodicy in Islamic Thought (Princeton, 1984), pp. 252-253 and 257. 23</page><page sequence="20">Eric Ormsby that is drastically at odds with "orthodox" doctrine. "Mercy" is, as it were, a code-word for a system in which, from the viewpoint of the "orthodox," the ineffable transcendence of God is fatally compro mised: If everything that exists, however fictive its existence, is some how, and ultimately, part and parcel of God's self-manifestation, the distinction between God and creature is blurred, if not effaced. More over, all our distinctions, such as that between good and evil, are finally illusory. Neither Pharaoh, nor anyone else, can be adjudged wicked in the end.66 Abd al-Q?dir al-Jaz?'iri (d. 1300/1883), the last participant known to me in the present debate, was a lifelong disciple of Ibn al Arabi, though (as Chodkiewicz in particular has pointed out) he was no mere imitator of his master but an original mind who elaborated his own mystical insights in an impressive body of work. (Until 1966, in fact, when his remains were returned to Algeria, Abd al-Q?dir lay alongside Ibn al-Arab? in the latter's tomb on the slopes of Mt. Q?siy?n in Damascus, thus vividly symbolizing the close connection of master and pupil.) In the present context, Abd al-Q?dir furnishes several distinctive replies to certain objections raised by al-Haraw? and others, and so it is fitting to close with him. In his brief consideration of our question, Abd al-Q?dir claims that his own instruction came directly from God. "God taught me," he says {la-qada lamani al-haqq ta'ala), "for example, that He intended the drowning of Pharaoh as an example to others but only in this world, and not in the next."67 On two other crucial points Abd al-Q?dir sides with, and defends, Ibn al-'Arabi and such defenders of his as al-Daww?n?: These are the genuineness of Pharaohs belief/? extremis ana the equal validity of his shah?dah. Pharaohs recognition of God's oneness, his declaration of tawhid, is authentic because he implicitly accepts the prophethood of 66. Izutsu puts it succinctly, as usual: "All events that occur in this world, all actions that are done, are, without even a single exception, due to the Divine Will. In this sense, there can be no distinction between good and bad, or right and wrong. Every phenomenon, as it actually is, is a direct effect of the Will of God," in op.cit., p. 120. 67. Mawdqif{s.l, 1329/1911), vol. 1, p. 54. On Abd al-Q?dir's instruction by God (as well as human masters), see M. Chodkiewicz's remarks in the introduction to his selected translation of the Maw?qif 'under the tide ?crits spirituels (Paris, 1982), pp. 24-25. 24</page><page sequence="21">The faith ofpharaoh : A disputated Question in Islamic Theology Moses and Aaron (and so, by extension, that of the Prophet Muham mad). This acceptance occurs when Pharaoh says, "I believe that there is no God but He in whom the Children of Israel believe" (10:89). By "Children of Israel" Pharaoh actually means Moses and Aaron; his acceptance of their role betokens his acceptance of their prophetic role. Therefore, his apparendy truncated profession of faith is in fact complete, and legally valid as well. Moreover, his belief was not the "belief of despair." If anything, it bore witness to God s miracles and testified to His omnipotence.68 In a sense, the debate over the faith of Pharaoh is yet another chap ter in an ongoing effort by more traditionalist thinkers, from Ibn Taym?yah on, to check the dangerous advance of "incarnationism" {hul?l}.? That is, in any case, the ostensible issue. It seems probable though that the persistence of the debate reflects another, more tacit matter; namely, the continuing spread and influence of Ibn al-Arab? s teachings which by the 15th-century appeared virtually unstoppable. Of course, it was not really a question of stopping the "Greatest Shaykh" or his followers; only the most stridently quixotic, like Ibrahim ibn 'Umar al-Biq?'i (d. 885/1480), thought to achieve that. Rather, it is a question of how to interpret and control a speculative mysticism as profoundly conceived as it is beautifully articulated. The gingerly way in which most of the disputants treat the person of Ibn al-Arabi indicates his growing, and eventually well-nigh unassailable, status. (Thus, al-Harawi remarks dryly that "it is safer to pass over him in silence."70) But in Islamic theology, the skirmishes, and some times the decisive battles, are often fought out in the commentaries, glosses, super-commentaries and super-glosses rather than in the texts themselves. In this sense, interpretation, especially of thought as eso teric and difficult as Ibn al-Arabi's, can be as much stratagem and power-play as it is hermeneutic. It is hardly possible to do justice to either the complexity or the extent of the debate over the faith of Pharaoh in a brief article. Suf fice it to say that the interest in the subject was neither historical nor 68. Maw?qifi vol. 1, p. 54. 69.

For others, more conventional, more precise and perhaps even more beleaguered, Pharaoh remained the prototype of the irredeemable unbeliever, a kind of negative exemplar. For certain of these more cir cumspect participants, there may have lurked as well the fear that if Pharaoh might be saved in the end, then even Ibn al-Arabi himself together with his disciples could be forgiven too. 26</page><page sequence="23">The faith ofpharaoh : A disputated Question in Islamic Theology APPENDIX The Participants in the Debate (A Provisional Listing)71 1.
