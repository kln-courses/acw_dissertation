GUHL The constitution of the Kan- sas Academy of Science requires an address by the retiring President at its annual meeting. By tradition the presentations have been based on his research. However I suspect that a number of my non-biology colleagues would not find a tech- nical discussion on the social be- havior of chickens very intriguing. I shall therefore take a broader and more philosophical approach since the general field of animal behavior has developed certain basic concepts and principles that have human implications, and has indi- cated some of the roots of man's social behavior (Allee, 1943, 1952: Scott, 1958; Bliss, 1962).

[171]</page><page sequence="2">172 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science Man's primary problem today lies in cooperation with his fellow man, and all too often his failure to do so results in man's inhumanity to man. Historically the problem began between tribes of primitive men, later between city states, nations and ethnic groups. Today with man's highly developed mobility, the hesitancy to cooperate on the inter- and intra-national levels is threatening his very existence. On the individual level, we face criminal tendencies and social maladjustments. If the bombs don't get us, then neuroses or the stress-syndrome may. All this at a time when men of intelligence, faith, and a high moral and social consciousness are making remarkable counterstrides. Can experimental science, especially sociobiology, contribute its share to man's better under- standing of man ? I'd like to suggest an hypothesis; that some of man's social problems are due, in part at least, to his tendency to assume that he lives above natural law; that his behavior and mental activities have their roots in mysticism. Also, that he does not realize that natural laws are never broken, like man-made laws, but are only illustrated by the consequences. Therefore we might explore the suggestive evidence of principles and concepts in social behavior which are common to most vertebrates includ- ing man. We need to examine first the logic and biological basis upon which such an assumption is premised. To a zoologist man is an animal, and he is also man. He is classi- fied among the backboned animals, or vertebrates, a mammal, and more specifically a primate. Homo sapiens, as he is called in taxonomy, has organs, physiology, reproduction and genetic mechanisms similar to animals closely related to him in the tree of life. He differs from them to a very marked degree in his capacity to learn, and his use of syntax (i.e., ability to convey complex ideas) whereas near relatives can convey only simple signals denoting the presence of food or danger; and parent- young signals, among others. He can deal in abstractions, a trait which the chaimpanzee has shown in limited capacity (Nissen and Crawford, 1936). Man's prospective physical evolution is unpromising at best, but his social inheritance by way of libraries, machine tools, and tradition as culture is unlimited in possibilities, and unique in the animal kingdom (Huxley, 1960). He is a highly subjective being and it behooves us, as rational individuals, to be very objective about our subjectivity. There are two fundamental pathways by which man may learn to improve his earthly status. One stems from deductions arrived at from past experience and from highly intuitive individuals with a well devel- oped ethical sensitivity, of which there have been, and are many. The other is by scientific experimentation. At present we need to consider</page><page sequence="3">Reflections by an Animal Behaviorist 173 both, and not to the exclusion of either. Our religious and social tradi- tions do not permit biological experimentation with man, and we have no controls when we deal with naturally occuring situations. How then do we apply our scientific knowledge to man's social welfare? Medicine became a science when it forsook the medicine-man with his shouting and drum beating, and turned to animal experimentation. It learned about the circulation of the blood, respiration, digestion, hor- mones, nervious mechanisms, effects of drugs, and the cause and cure of various diseases. Psychology, likewise, became a science when it learned about mechanisms of behavior, reaction patterns, laws of learning, frustration and neuroses in animals. It has not only been assumed but also demonstarted that basic principles discovered by animal experi- mentation could be applied to man if the animals were vertebrates and especially if they were closely related to man in their physical attributes. Therefore it is relevant to discover principles in the social life of verte- brates with the hope of obtaining human implications. Many such studies have been made and are being conducted with animals ranging from fishes through reptiles, birds and mammals to primates, and some generalizations are now emerging. Many species of backboned animals are aggressive, i.e., are self- assertive and attack or threaten their associates (Collias, 1944). These also show a trait called submissiveness, i.e., they submit to domination or avoid their social superiors. Individuals vary characteristically in the level of both of these types of responses. Thus highly aggressive indi- viduals dominate most of the members of their species within a given locality, and thereby attain certain rights of precedence under competi- tive situations. Observations on fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals have shown that groups may be organized on the basis of precedence through domination. The order of precedence promotes group integra- tion as each individual learns when and where to exercise its rights. There are two main categories of social organization. One is based on territorialism and the other is a dominance order or peck-order. There may be considerable variation in each or there may be combina- tions. In some animals domination is seasonal and occurs only during the reproductive phase. Some animals in all classes of vertebrates display territoriality (Car- penter, 1958). Many of our songbirds establish territories (Hinde, 1956) and we will use them for a brief illustration. A mated pair selects an area in which a nest is built and the young are reared. Others of the same species are attacked when they enter or approach the area. The male's singing on high perches has been shown to serve as a</page><page sequence="4">174 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science warning signal and advertises the territory. Such domains insure non- interference during mating, breeding and rearing, and maintain a feed- ing area. This type of organization is reminiscent of human situations in early Kansas when the farmstead provided all the needs for a family, and when the homesteader had to do his own defending. Marine birds, such as gulls and terns, occupy narrow ledges on cliffs and with limited space for the large population they reduce territories to small circum- scribed areas about the nest. The parents leave alternately to forage over the water, that is, they go to work at a distance, and when one returns to the nest it undergoes a recognition ceremony before being admitted. This is analogous to the apartment of Homo sapiens. Strangers use the doorbell or else take the consequences. Immature young, like children, are permitted to roam over the area without attack. Dominance orders occur among animals which live in groups, such as herds, flocks, schools of fish or troops of primates (Allee, 1952). These hierarchial organizations are based on the ranking of individuals accord- ing to the number of individuals each may dominate without any retali- ation. When chickens are marked for individual identification, one can record the delivery of pecks by any bird on any of its flockmates. A tab- ulation (Figure 1.) of these attacks makes the organization evident. The order may be straight-line, or it may contain pecking triangles. In groups containing males and females, the males usually show passive dominance over the females, so that each sex has its own peck-order. Most males will not tolerate hen-pecking. A similar type of organization was found among dairy cattle (Guhl and Atkeson, 1959). How is a peck-order established? With chicks reared together, fighting develops at about the fourth week of age, and after some spar- ring the individuals soon learn to avoid certain others, so that an order is formed by about 10-12 weeks of age (Guhl, 1958). Since adults will attack any stranger, they immediately begin to fight or peck when unacquainted birds are brought together. The winner of each contest thereafter has the right to peck the loser. When each penmate has settled its dominance relations with each in the flock the peck-order is established. Any late comers are at a disadvantage because they have to engage in a contest with each of the residents. In time, as inter-indi- vidual habits become well established by reinforcement, the threats and avoidances moderate and become symbolic, involving no more than a raising and lowering of the head as two birds meet (Guhl, 1962). Such inter-individual responses that indicate toleration would be referred to as manners in human social relations. At about the time when peck-orders were beginning to get experi-</page><page sequence="5">Reflections by an Animal Behaviorist 175 mental attention in a variety of animals, sociologists were making some- what similar studies of man. Several such studies of human social classes in America have been made, and these have more recently been popu- larized by the writings of Vance Packard. However, it was Cattell (1942) who established five social classes with two grades in each class, making a total of ten classes. The criteria for status were items which people used for estimating whether a person ranked above or beneath them in the social scale, i.e., human methods of pecking. Some of these merit mentioning by way of illustration. 1. Prestige of occupation, judged by attempts to reach it. (Today we might add scientists and engineers engaged in in space research.) 2. Size of income; also whether paid as a salary or as a wage. 3. Possession of wealth or property and of unearned income. 4. Length and type of education.

Social status of those with whom the individual associates in private life, in recreation or business. 6. Neighborhood; size and type of residence. 7. Amount of conspicuous expenditure on luxuries, recrea- tion, arts and leisure. (Today the boat with trailer might fit this category.) 8. Moral standards. Greater crude delinquency at lower levels and less dogmatic standards at high levels. 9. Code of manners, dress, food, and speech (accent). 10. Incidence of psychosis and nervous disorders (negative correlation with status). Thus we see that man displays social ranks as well as territorialism. This combination also exists in some animals. Our pet dogs will defend their premises against the intrusion of strange dogs, and sometimes against human strangers. Since their early life is spent in a litter they also have the habit of ranging in packs, like wolves, within which there is a dominance order (Scott, 1950; 1954). Having described social organization, we might turn momentarily to some physiological aspects of agonistic behavior, defined as attack and avoidance or escape behavior. Some birds have a peck-order during the non-breeding season and territory during the reproductive phase. This shift indicates an increase in aggressiveness. The ring-necked pheasant serves as a good illustration. During the fall and winter these birds are in flocks with a dominance order (Collias and Taber, 1951). In January aggressiveness increases progressively in the males and they begin to break up into smaller groups so that by March the males cease to tolerate close proximity of fellow males. Thus territories are established. These changes are correlated with the increasing size of the testes that secrete the male sex hormone, androgen. The indications are, as many studies have shown (see review, Guhl, 1961), that androgen makes the birds more aggressive. It may be recalled here that it has been known since biblical times that castration makes animals, as well as man, more docile, although learned behavior may mask these effects. At this point your thoughts may have turned to a question of the significance of the social organization in the life of vertebrates. About 20 years ago we wanted to contrast an organized flock of chickens with an unorganized one. Since these birds fight to settle their dominance relations, or peck-rights, as soon as they are brought together, this was impossible. The best that could be done was to compare an organized and well integrated flock with one having a changing flock membership to keep the social order in a state of flux. To do this a rotation was set</page><page sequence="7">Reflections by an Animal Behaviorist 177 up in which a bird in longest residence was removed and replaced with one from isolation (a stranger). Each hen was in the flock as an alter- nate member for only two weeks. Feeding was restricted in time to increase competition and to place the experiment at a critical level (Guhl and Allee, 1944). To establish the importance of group organization an examination of the results in graphic form merits some consideration. In Figure 2 we see that the socially unstable alternates pecked each other consistently at a higher rate than did the integrated controls. There was also a differ- ence in the intensity of pecking. The controls did not deliver their pecks and resorted to the milder form of threatening postures, whereas the alternates delivered their pecks and many of the combs had bloody wounds. While viewing these results one might reflect on situations in human civil populations during extreme social stresses such as wars or economic upheavals. The amount of feed consumed is shown in Figure 3 for the con- trols, the non-integrated alternates, and the same birds in isolation. It will be noted that the alternates consumed the least amount of feed. Other data showed that the alternates lost weight in the pen whereas the controls maintained or gained body weight. Of interest to the poultrymen is the fact that the integrated controls laid the most eggs. Thus we see that social organization conserves energy and has survival value. On the human level the indications are that in a world shrunken W300 30 ---- CONTROLS o - ALTERNATES /1 1250 C" I I -A i--- i - :,, ' / \ .J ", 0 0 o:20 \i, . , ; \, o.

For details see Guhl and Allee, 1944.</page><page sequence="8">178 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science by modern communication and transportation, i.e., more frequent inter- relations between various peoples, some form of organization is worthy of the effort. This experiment with a shifting flock membership yielded some other data of interest to this discussion. In Figure 4 each dot represents the social rank of a hen during its residence in the pen of alternates for a stay of 14 days. You may recall that the longest resident was removed at the end of two weeks and was replaced by a bird from isolation. Dur- ing the first two days in the group a hen usually was at the bottom of the peck-order. It moved up gradually as its superiors were removed and newcomers were added. On the last day in the flock (day 14) it usually was in top rank. Note that some obtained top rank during the first two days and that one individual never moved from lowest rank, even on its last day in the pen. Here we have evidence for a biological basis for seniority rights. In groups of animals living in nature the newcomers are usually the young that tend to follow the same pattern as the older members die off. This biological background for seniority rights does not infer that seniority among men should be followed with rigidity, we are not chickens. It merely indicates that such rights are a natural phenomenon and must be recognized as such. Societies composed of rational human beings should consider more significant factors in raising the status of individuals. We gladly leave this task to the sociologists and to social psychologists. - CONTROLS 800 ----ALTERNATES * .-.-* ISOLATES S700 cr\ a. 600 I /0 51 "" ,,,W E' I ~ ~ :' \ / , /-, " w,. ,I ', o.400 I V 'A v -, f .'~ " -''I '" I/ '\ - &lt; 300 A + B () AC -4C --- - D E FJ-+-- G--- 200 0 5 ,O IS 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 WEEKS Figure 3.

Unfortunately, little has been done in animal studies which bear on the problem of racial and other minority groups within the social structure, although there appears to be a biolog- ical substrate among chickens. In small flocks of hens the odd individual is often driven and persecuted. Breed recognition has been observed by several experimentors (Douglis, 1948; Potter, 1949; Hale, 1957). Indi- viduals of one breed will treat all individuals of a different color in the same manner, i.e., they do not recognize individuals of the strange breed. However, observations at Kansas State University (Tindell and Craig, 1959) have shown that color differences between breeds are unimportant in large flocks and that individual recognition is typical. Different breeds reared together as chicks will not draw the color line (Bellah, 1957). .?? '': . .? . 0..... ? ? w? i:!!i ": a-? z... . ?.. -. - "-" a:? OI ?r . ?i 6.

Unaggres- sive strains are at a disadvantage when mingled with aggressive strains. The evidence here may be too sparse to attempt any human implications, nevertheless, it does suggest that animal experimentation may offer some helpful suggestions. Strain and breed differences as well as the peck-order indicate variability in levels of aggressiveness as a trait that may have a genetic aspect. The early domestication of the chicken was in the interest of cockfighting and the birds were selectively bred for this purpose. Pre- viously it was mentioned that sex hormones influence agonistic behavior, however, castrated males may fight briefly under certain conditions and will form a peck-order (Guhl, 1958). Whatever the physiological or structural basis for this trait, it can be measured and therefore a selective breeding program can be followed. Unacquainted birds within each sex can be matched by pairs to settle their dominance relations. The indi- vidual levels of aggressiveness are estimated by the number of contests each bird won. Following this procedure we mated the most aggressive males with the most aggressive females, and also the least aggressive of each sex.

From Guhl, Craig and Mueller, 1960.</page><page sequence="11">Reflections by an Animal Behaviorist 181 1960). This study is being continued with larger numbers and with two breeds to determine whether aggressiveness may be correlated with certain other traits. One can only wonder whether differences between various peoples also have a gentic basis or whether they stem largely from early exper- ience within different cultures or standards of living. Suggestions for studies on this social issue have been made by Ingle (1961). One avenue of approach was attempted by Dobzhanski (1962) in considering the possible genetic consequences within a society that had rigidly closed castes for about 100 generations. He concluded that the castes did not concentrate the genes for special abilities and aptitudes in particular breeding groups." Since most of man's behavior, as contrasted with that of higher vertebrates, is acquired through learning, selection may be ex- pected to be on the basis of culture. According to Huxley (1960) when hominids became man, the psycho-social phase of evolution was initiated on this earth. Hence man can influence his own evolution through a scientific approach to human values. Allee (1938, 1952), Gerard (1940), Emerson (1954), and Herrick (1956) have discussed the biological backgrounds and H. J. Muller (1958) has projected the possibilities. Thus far the indications are that a number of human traits in social behavior have their roots in the animal kingdom. Non-scientists have often come to a similar conclusion, but with one difference. You have heard people say that certain behavior of a pet, such as a dog or monkey, is almost human. This is the old historical impression of the Greeks and the Romans who gave human attributes to animals as well as to inanimate objects. Today we call this anthropomorphism. The con- cept may be more accurate if the statement were reversed. You may object to such a view and say "But man has culture." According to the anthropologist Kluckhohn (1949) culture is "the total life way of a people, the social legacy the individual acquires from his group". In it "the biological functioning of individuals is modified if they are trained in certain ways and not others". Even this unique character of human society has a simple precursor among some animals. There is no evolutionary anlagen of culture in chickens because the flock does not include several generations maintained continuously within the same area. However, learned interactions within a flock may become relatively fixed as social inertia, which has a profound effect on certain biological functions of individuals (Guhl, 1963). Rudiments of cul- ture, however, do exist in some monkeys. In the rugged mountains of the Japanese islands there live some</page><page sequence="12">182 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science free-ranging monkeys (macaques) which are being studied by some members of the staff at Kyoto University (Etkin and Diamond, 1961). Two evidences of cultural transmission or tradition have been observed. A female of one troop chanced to wash her food, and persisted in doing so. After some time the practice became common for that troop but was not seen in other troops. Another troop ranged to the edge of a park where people liked to feed them. Someone started to offer candy; soon the interest became established throughout that group. A recent study of baboons in Africa (Washburn and DeVore, 1961) has shown that troops set up group territories without intermingl- ing. Each troop has its own characteristic traditions as to daily routine and use of the vegetational facilities. The young spend many months in close association with their mothers, and they are a center of interest for all adults, including the dominant male. Thus the traditions become established through generations. Learned social behavior integrates the group and very little social strife has been reported among free-living terrestrial monkeys. Ruth Benedict (1960) compared several primitive cultures and showed that they may mould individuals into societies that may have dominant traits of either non-aggressiveness, animosity, or extreme rivalry. It is what man learns and develops in his culture that determines his way of life. Can the social inertia and the traditions of a particular culture be changed without radical upheaval or revolutions? Does the renewed interest in Oswald Spengler's "The Decline of the West" (1962) suggest a belief that civilizations pass through a simulated ecological succession, or did Spengler's observation result from the general westward migration into new lands which offered an oppor- tunity for new cultures to develop without the restrictions imposed by the inertia of ingrained traditions? The pessimist envisages the possibility of the former brought about by atomic catastrophe and the possible reconstitution of a civilization arising from the ashes. But man is an intellectual animal whose cultural evolution is not derived from modified DNA. The cultural mutagenic agents are discovery and learning. Cul- tures can grow in the same manner as animal populations. Populations of organisms, whether micro-organisms, insects, or man, tend to follow a sigmoid, or Gausean, curve found when changes in size are plotted against time (Allee, et al, 1949). The acceptance of hybrid corn, farm machinery, or home appliances follow the same pattern and have been used by industry to project their plans for the manufacture and sale of their products. A similar projection was made by Brode (1962) for the growth of science. Of particular interest to us is the</page><page sequence="13">Reflections by an Animal Behaviorist 183 effects of stimulation on the growth curve. Each new device or concept produces another acceleration in the curve. One need only recall the effects of the telephone, the automobile, electronics, the electron micro- scope, and atomic physics to visualize an expanding culture. Nations that have not accepted these innovations have remained on the plateau of fixed cultures. Enginering, industry, and some of the arts may also show stimulation, but what of our socio-political and philosophical ideologies? We may conclude from this sketchy presentation that man's social behavior has the same basic characteristics as those of other vertebrates, although considerably elaborated in detail. Have we progressed from the peck-order stage of nations ? Dominance among nations has served to promote peace before our mobility reached the level it has today. Both Rome and England maintained a stable world order through domination in times past. Excessive tension through domination in animal groups is disruptive. The United States did not set up a dominance order among states, and their social and political structure has served as a rough model for the world. Man's greatest asset is his ability to learn and to evaluate. Can we, when should we, or should we alter our traditions? Must we learn to develop a single culture for all mankind, or can a modicum be tolerated effectively through learning, much as we as individuals respect each other's beliefs? If man's evolution is cultural, then there must be some variability upon which selection may operate. Man's future rests heavily on the collective use of his intelligence; on his seeking of verifiable truths; on his development of curiosity, of satisfying motives, of the desire for understanding, and of his skill in reaching sound judgements. Each generation in its development from an animal infancy must pass through stages during which it acquires these uniquely human traits and ideals, which give life meaning and a realization that each individual's contribution to humanity is the ultimate in life. The future is in the hands of education, including all means of communication. If man is to progress he should contribute more to the search for and the dissemination of truths and values, than to the mere addition of excess protoplasm to an already swelling mass.
