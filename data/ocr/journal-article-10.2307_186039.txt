<plain_text><page sequence="1">ERNEST GELLNER. Thought and change. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1965. 224 pp. $5.00. Mr. Gellner's theme is the transition from pre-industrialized to industrialized society and the response (or the lack of it) in contemporary thought to this transition. In particular he is critical, not to say contemptuous, of the failure of contemporary philosophy, at least in its academic Anglo-American variety, to come to grips with a process the ramifications of which overshadow all previous changes in human society. The importance of this change, Gellner advises us, can hardly be overestimated in terms of its effect both on the material conditions of our existence and on our thought about this process, whether that thought be systematic and self-conscious or not. Indeed we are told that industrial society involves a wholly new relationship between "knowing" and "being" in which science plays the crucial role. "Roughly, science is the mode of cognition of industrial society, and industry is the ecology of science" (p. 179). Gellner's presupposition, itself largely unargued for, is that the difference between pre- or underindustrialized societies on the one hand and industrialized societies on the other is nmore important than that, as many others would hold, between capitalist and socialist societies. Gellner might say, for example, that the differences between industrialized (but socialist) Czechoslovakia and industrialized (but capitalist) France are less striking or less important than those between the former and socialist China on the one hand, or the latter and capitalist India on the other. Which differences and similarities are important depends of course on what one is trying to do-whether understand and predict, validate and condemn, or recommend and decide. This is not to deny, nor does Gellner, that there are real and important factual and moral differences between socialist and capitalist societies, or between religious and secular societies, and so on; but these differences, in Gellner's view, begin to be submerged when one considers the certainty (barring nuclear war or exploding sun, etc.) that in the not too distant future the whole world will be industrialized. It is instructive, perhaps, in order to get the flavor of Gellner's book, to compare it both as to theme and as to style with that of certain contemporary French thinkers, particularly with the work of Raymond Aron. Gellner himself pays homage to Aron who over the last few years, while often taking up the case for the moral superiority of liberal democracy to socialism (mistakenly, I think, for the most part) has nevertheless consistently argued for what he likes to call the "concept" of industrialized society. And his plea is much the same as Gellner's: that the Marxists have overestimated the importance of the "relations of production" in giving rise to and in solving (by changing them) the problems engendered by developments in the "forces of production." Or, in less Marxist terminology, the problems and issues for modern man are mainly posed by industrialism generally and not specifically by its capitalist (or socialist) variant. But this is an extremely complex question, and I don't think there is any simple or obvious answer to it. Gellner's book also pays unintended homage to French thought in its sometimes confusing mixture of philosophical analysis (in spite of himself), sociology, and moralizing. By and large it is clear when he is doing which (in spite of his own half-explicit view that they cannot really be separated). An example of the confusion an uncritical combination may produce can be found on page 34: If this account of our underlying effective political theory, globally shared, is correct, it has the consequence that the heir of 'classical' political theory is now sociology. It is sociology 11 +P.S.</page><page sequence="2">160 BOOK REVIEWS which is concerned witlh the understanding of that process, which is now central to validat- ing, or even conceptualizing society . . . Sociology was born of the attempt, since the eighteenth century, to understand the fundamental transformation of society, a transforma- tion which has since become increasingly more drastic and more manifest. To be sure, Gellner warns us in a footnote to this passage that we are not to take it as "some simplistic doctrine to the effect that a 'normative' job can be taken over by a 'positive' science," which very much tempts one to take it as a nonsimplistic doctrine to that effect. But barring that, it is difficult to understand what exactly Gellner's point is. If it is an historical account of the genesis of modern sociology, and only that, then that account seems unexceptionable, only its truth or falsity is quite independent of Gellner's "account of our underlying effective political theory," of which more presently. But it is only fair to add that the confusion in this passage is not typical of Gellner's good English analytical mind. Not only is industrialization the major social fact of modern times, but it also is the basis of what Gellner calls in the passage quoted above "our underlying effective political theory." This "theory," which Gellner says is at least implicitly the dominant one of our times among the populations at large, holds that government is legitimate if it satisfies two conditions: "(a) It is bringing about, or successfully maintaining, an industrial affluent society; (b) Those in authority are co-cultural with the rest of the society" (p. 33). (Co-culturalism means, roughly, of the same people or society.) Gellner claims further that it is right that these be the generally held condi- tions for loyalty to a government or social order. These remarks bring us to his account of social myths and world-views generally. I think that his account is inadequate in some respects and simply mistaken in others. Gellner distinguishes three kinds of "progress" world-views which he calls the Episodic, the Evolutionist, and the neo-Episodic. Each, we are led to understand (e.g. p. 1) is intended to be an explanatory as well as a validating theory. Episodic theories typically divide the history of the race into two parts-the earlier bad and the later good-and sees some crucial event as constituting the transition from one to the other. Gellner offers as his major example classical Social Contrast theory, and then proceeds to criticize it on the grounds that even if there had been such an event as the making of a contract, it would fail to explain the transition from the "state of nature" to civil society. His criticism seems to me to involve a bit of anthropomorphic causal thinking to the effect that the more complex cannot come from the less so; but apart from that one may wonder whether anyone ever thought of the social contract myth as an explanatory theory, rather than only as a validating one. Hobbes, for example, goes so far as to say that it doesn't matter whether there ever actually was such an occurrence; surely then he did not take his theory as an explanatory one. Rousseau, too, explains that he does not know what brought the change about (that "men are everywhere in chains") but he says he does hope to furnish an answer to the question what can make that condition (sometimes) legitimate. Gellner is no doubt correct in maintaining that evolutionist world-views have sometimes been taken as both explanatory and validating, and it is easy to show, as he does, that merely citing the course of history or the succession of "stages" of society does not explain anything. It should be emphasized, however, that this does not preclude the possibility of there being "historical laws of development".' To point out that a pot of water boiled after it was heated to 2120 F doesn't explain why the water boiled either until one has established that the sequence is an instance of a law, but it is such an instance nevertheless. So too, certain sequences at the social level may be instances of laws whether we know it or not. In a context where one did know those laws, if any, citing the sequence would be explanatory. On the validating side, Gellner's criticism of evolutionism (though he tried to give it a good run for its money) itself rests on the moral judgment that one ought not prostrate oneself before history. Just because something is inevitable doesn't mean it's good, and we should retain our freedom and independence of choice. I do not wish to quarrel here with Gellner's values, as I have little quarrel with them anyway, but his way of putting things I think misrepresents the psychology of the situation. I find it difficult to believe that any one, at least beyond the most superficial levels of consciousness, patterned his values solely upon what he believed to be inevitable. Surely in the relevant sense the values come first. Indeed it is almost a truism that no one is likely to believe in the inevitability of something unless he has already put a (perhaps negative) valuation on it. I think Gellner would be hard pressed to find any evolutionist even at the conscious, intellectual level, who would argue that the inevitable is desirable only because 1 See my "Historicism and Historical Laws of Development," Inquiry, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 161 it is inevitable. Secondly, his contrast between those who presumably prostrate themselves before history and all others seems very artificial. It suggests that the others do not commit themselves to any values on anything like a permanent basis, but instead pick and choose their values at random so that they can't be accused of surrendering their "integrity." Gellner of course means none of this, and in another context challenges those whose views and actions approximate the random view, calling them the "much of muchness" people who caution against the possibility or desirability of anything like an "overview" of society. The neo-Episodic world-view, or at least the only instance of which Gellner discusses, is none less than what he refers to as "our underlying effective political theory" of which we have already taken note. It remains only to point out, as he himself does, that this "theory" is only a validat- ing and not at all an explanatory one. This world-view is neo-Episodic because it does not, like Episodic views proper, divide the whole of human history into two (or more) "stages." To be sure, it does divide human history in a way into pre-industrialized and industrialized, but (1) the use of 'pre-industrialized' is not supposed to refer to all nonindustrialized societies of the past but only those of the recent past and present in which, while not the fact, at least the expecta- tions, impulses, and to a certain extent the attitudes of industrialized societies are present and (2) it is the transition itself and not so much the "final" goal in which we are interested. Some societies are already industrialized to be sure, but one may observe in Gellner's behalf (1) that neither the popular nor the scientific philosophical consciousness has fully absorbed the change, and (2) that (or so it is not too implausible to claim) the policies and attitudes of all countries, including the American intervention in Vietnam, stem largely from the fact that some countries are not industrialized. As I hinted above, a good deal of Gellner's book is more or less straight sociology including the sociology of knowledge, of social change, and of nationalism. Most of what he says on these scores rings plausible to me, but for the most part I am in no position to judge. The background for what he says on these topics is of course Marxism, and one could describe Gellner's book in a way as an attempt to sustain a post-Marxist world-view including some of the comprehen- siveness of Marxism, but without its eschatology (which is largely a dead letter now even for Marxist thinkers themselves, as Gellner notes; but that is still different from its self-conscious rejection). The irony of Marxism, but at the same time the source of its continuing influence and relevance, is that rather than being the tool and ideology of advanced industrialized societies transforming themselves from capitalist to socialist, it has been and will continue to be the tool and ideology of pre-industrial societies transforming themselves into industrialized ones. As such Marxism itself is transformed from an Evolutionist to a neo-Episodic world view. This is all to the better, as Gellner sees it, but he rejects the "fashionable suggestion or supposition that capitalist and communist societies are 'converging"' (p. 132). Just as there are alternative roads to industrialization, no one more "natural" than another, although for various reasons the capitalist road is by now exhausted, so there are various (at least two) forms of industrial society; and, to repeat, while Gellner holds the fact of industrialization to be more important than the different forms it may take, this is not to deny the real differences between, say, capitalist and socialist societies or to suppose that those differences will disappear in the forseeable future. I also indicated that Geliner is not happy about the role of contemporary academic philoso- phy in understanding the world-wide transition to industrialization that is presently taking place. Its failure, if it be one, is both moral and intellectual and has its own social roots. I should like briefly to examine some of Gellner's complaints about contemporary philosophy. Gellner remarks that Kierkegaard identified Hegel with philosophy, believing that if we are to accept philosophy at all we have to accept Hegel's absorption of existence into essence. Gellner sometimes seems guilty of a similar error in identifying philosophical analysis generally with the methods and doctrines of the later Wittgenstein and his followers in particular. It is easy to agree that the doctrines of the later Wittgenstein are almost wholly false and that the work of his self-conscious followers is by and large false when of substance, trivial when true. But there are times when Gellner seems to reject philosophical analysis altogether, i.e. the sort of analysis that consists in the making of distinctions and arguments in contrast, to science on the one hand and to mere dogmatic assertions on the other. Perhaps I can make my points best by taking one of Gellner's major examples. An additional disadvantage of the old logico-positivistic way of thinking about the division [between the "verifiable" and the "nonverifiable"] is of course that, consigning that which is not science or does not resemble it, to the limbo of the 'meaningless,' it can then say nothing about the denizens of that realm, nor in any rational way discriminate</page><page sequence="4">162 BOOK REVIEWS amongst them-without, of course, such an abstention being at all practicable. Moral, etc., judgments continue to be passed. If anything is said about these spheres, it is the curious consignment of them to the hands of prophets, seers, etc. (pp. 210-211). Would I be hopelessly begging the question of the "value" of analysis if I insisted on a distinc- tion between the logical connections of ideas on the one hand and the causal effect of their being held and promulgated on the other? I do not care to judge what the social effects of the doctrines of logical positivism have been, but I fail completely to see how anything the positivists (Gellner mentions Ayer in particular) said entails (the moral judgment) that we should stop making moral judgments, even if it were possible to do so. Nor does it follow (nor was it said) that nothing rational can be said about the nonscientific realms and what distinguishes them from each other. The positivists' point about the moral, aesthetic, and religious realms was not so much their meaninglessness (for which way of speaking they have been amply chastised already) but rather their nonverifliability; and to underscore this point seems to me important if we wish to live, not just as philosophers but as men, without illusion. The psychology and sociology of values-the fact that most people implicitly regard their value judgments as factual claims; that they do not always recognize their value judgments as such; that causally our (factual) beliefs and values interact even if we are without illusion as to the nature of values; that unless we are insane, the facts are rationally relevant to the implementation of our values if not to our values themselves-this can all be acknowledged; but the "analytic" point still stands that a value judgment is not capable of verification or falsification in anything like the way factual statements are. What I find pernicious (intellectually) about academic moral philosophy is not the positivists' point which I hold to be true, but (1) that moral philosophies are usually judged ultimately on intuitionist grounds, though this seems to be largely unrecog- nized (Gellner does the same thing with Evolutionism) and (2) that the making of moral judg- ments in language seems to be taken implicitly as the only or at least the most important way in which we express our values; and it seems to me not obviously to be either. In the final section of this book Gellner is concerned with the fashioning of a new image of man in the light of science and industrialism. He rightly rejects the intellectually cheap attempts of many contemporary philosophers to "save" our humanity by denying the possibility or relevance of a science of man; by claiming, for example, that something called the 'concept' of human action "logically" excludes causal explanations of human behavior. It is curious in this regard that Gellner does not mention Marxism generally and contemporary East European Marxism in particular as among the serious attempts to construct an image of man consistent with secularism, modern science, and industrialism. Surely, in its direction if not in its achieve- ment, the work of Kolakowski and Schaff, Petrovic and Markovic, and even Lukacs and others is more relevant to this task than what Gellner correctly identified as the head-in-the-sandism of most contemporary Anglo-American thinking on the subject. The specific shortcoming of contemporary Marxism in this task is its failure to fit Freud into the picture, and again it is curious that the latter is not even mentioned in Gellner's essay although one subsection is entitled "The Ego and the Id." To be sure, Freud did not conceive his findings as having much to do with differing social arrangements and levels of technological development, but surely we can see through Freud's work that, short of rebuilding man biologically, in which case all bets are off, there are limits to wlhat man can become even with the most advanced technology. If this review has been a bit rambling, I hope it has managed to convey something of the richness of the contents of Gellner's book. While it is not of the sort one would ordinarily described as profound, it nevertheless raises serious social and philosophical issues in a way that makes it deserving of the attention not only of philosophers but of any who want to understand or to have an effect on the contemporary world.
