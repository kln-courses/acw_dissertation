Keller We sat in a pleasant if nondescript mid- town restaurant. Most of the other lun- cheon patrons had left, yet we lingered over our coffee. "Yes, I do understand, John, but I also feel quite strongly that youve got to know your own limitations," she said. I nodded in partial agreement but thought to myself, 'Tes, but not if those self-declared limitations stop you from growing." The speaker in this case was author Ellen Conford, a very clever, very intelli- gent young writer of children's books whose reputation as a writer children like to read and who teachers, librarians and parents like to have children like to read, is growing at a steady rate. And I was the Editor of Children's Books for Little, Brown and Company. Ellen Conford's re- mark and my reaction to it has come to symbolize for me- and for the purpose of this article- the healthy tension that exists in the relationship between one writer and her editor as they work toward the goal of producing the best books for children that they can. John G. Keller is Editor, Children's Books at Little, Brown and Company. Of course, every relationship must have a beginning and I think you might be in- terested in my view of the way Ellen Con- ford became one of Little, Brown's most popular authors of books for children. Picture, if you will, a young man who had grown restless doing promotion work for children's books and who, thinking him- self fairly literate, and who had talked to a fair number of teachers and a great num- ber of librarians about their needs as sup- pliers of books to children and who, fur- thermore, didn't believe the canard that successful editors of children's books be- come slightly nauseated at the sight of a child, asking (begging!) his boss for a chance to try editing. The boss, being a congenial fellow and, more importantly, having a slot to fill, agreed. The young man got his new job and felt very pleased with himself indeed. The only serpent in this newfound Eden was that to be an editor one needs some- thing to edit. No one knows a new editor. Agents don't fill your in-basket with excit- ing new manuscripts- or very many manu- scripts of any kind, for that matter. And other editors in the firm usually are not about to turn over authors they've worked with for years to your tender mercies. Therefore, I was left during my first two 791</page><page sequence="3">792 Elementary English months on the job to sharpen my pencil a great deal, take innumerable strolls to the water fountain, and to read the pile of unsolicited manuscripts which, to give it its common name, is the dreaded slush pile. With the experience of several years, I can now say that for some reason- per- haps more people remember vividly their own childhood- this so-called slush pile can often yield children's book manuscripts that either are publishable or can be made so with a little work. However, when I first started reading these manuscripts I seemed only to come upon dreary little stories told in trochaic tetrameter, all of which had anthropomorphic animals, vege- tables, or minerals who were somehow dif- ferent and who didn't wish to be ('The Little Diamond That Didn't Shine," "The Fuzzy Squirrel Without a Tail," etc. etc., ad nauseam). Imagine my relief- my joy- when after two months during which I thought I'd never find an author worth publishing I came upon a funny and fresh manuscript about a young, unprepossessing possum who couldn't seem to catch on to the knack of hanging by his tail. The manu- script did have one to two scenes that I felt were overly long but, on the whole, I liked it immensely and I especially liked the dialogue, which was consistently amus- ing and never became cute. "Are you hurt?" asked his mother anxiously. "No more than usual," sighed Randolph. 1 don't think I broke any bones." His father shook his head. "I just don't un- derstand it. Your mother and I can hang by our tails; your brother Eugene can hang by his tail; your sister Geraldine can hang by her tail. It's the most natural thing in the world to sleep upside down." To show Randolph how easy it was, Ger- aldine went back up the tree. She scurried out onto a limb, hung upside down, and sang "Pop Goes the Weasel!" as she swung by her tail. "Would you like to hear "Mary Had a Lit- tle Lamb?* she asked. "Nobody likes a show-off," sulked Ran- dolph. The dialogue, while subdued, was in essence what I heard going on all the time in my suburban household; the book turned out to be Impossible, Possum; and the au- thor who seemed to be the answer to my prayers was, of course, Ellen Conford. Since I was crazy about the text, my feelings of delight were further increased when I wrote to Mrs. Conford telling her of my interest, and received from her a charming letter in which she enclosed a marvelous parody of a well-known chil- dren's book writer whom she read had been picked up for speeding. It began: I am Law John Law I am. You were speeding Sir or Ma'am You were doing eighty-five I wonder you are still alive. What could be better? An author who could write funny letters as well as funny books. I knew I would enjoy working with her. Everything about Possum worked right. In a field where it often takes several books before the market begins to know and trust an author, this first book exceeded our ex- pectations. Blessed by witty and imagina- tive drawings by Rosemary Wells, it was chosen one of the best books of the year by the influential School Library Journal and went on to sell in very respectable num- bers. I'm sure Irving Wallace did not pull his hair in envy over its sales pattern, but it was very strong for a first children's book. I thought of myself as the most fortunate of editors and, when a second funny pic- ture-book text was delivered by Mrs. Con- ford I was most pleased. Why Can't I Be William? was a grass-is-always-greener story, which I asked another young tal- ented artist, Philip Wende, to illustrate. Mr. Wende did a fine job, but after he sent us his final illustrations he phoned me to say in essence that while he really liked the</page><page sequence="4">Ellen and Me or The Editor as Fisherman's Wife 793 story when he read it, when he came to illustrate he found that the characters real- ly didn't do very much but talk. And darn it- -it was difficult to create interesting illus- trations of people just standing around talking. Needless to say, I did not pass on Mr. Wende's comments to Mrs. Conford, but the more I thought about it, the more I came to think that he might have put his finger on a possible weakness of Ellen Con- ford as a writer of picture books. She did tend to emphasize dialogue- sometimes at the expense of scenes that were easy to illustrate. But what fine dialogue it was! Here is Jonathan, the hero, and his mother having a confrontation in a supermarket: Jonathan's mother stopped her shopping cart in the middle of the aisle. "Listen, Jonathan," she said sternly. "You are not William and I am not William's moth- er, and I don't know any mother who doesn't say no sometimes." "Yes you do," said Jonathan. "You know Williams mother. She never says no. She lets William buy anything he wants in the store. Ask William if you don't believe me." Jonathan wondered why his mother closed her eyes and sighed. "Jonathan," she warned, "I'm getting very tired of this discussion." "I'm not tired of it," Jonathan said. "Well, I am, and I'm finished talking." "That's okay," said Jonathan. "I'll just talk some more." "No you won't!" his mother said in a very loud voice. Jonathan noticed that all of a sud- den it was very quiet in the store. "How come all those people are looking at us?" he whispered. "They are wondering," said his mother very softly, "when I am going to lose my temper and spank you." Sound familiar? I know many seven-year- olds and their mothers who recognize the dialogue and the emotions at once. None- theless, the exchange doesn't give an illus- trator much to go on. Well, what to do? I had wished for a good writer and had luckily found one. How could I tell her that after all perhaps her talents might be better used in an area outside that of picture books- say, novels for the nine- to twelve-year-old age group? Nothing ventured etc., so I wrote to Ellen and gingerly suggested the idea. After such a letter gets into the mails, I always ex- pect to receive either an irate phone call or the kind of return letter that makes my secretary sigh and roll her eyes heavenward as she puts it in the in-basket. My fears in this case were unfounded. Ellen wrote me one of those letters that brighten one's day. To summarize: Although it will mean that I must put aside (temporarily) the six sequels to Possum-The French Lieutenant's Possum, Valley of the Possums , Thus Spake Impossible Possum, etc. etc. I think the idea a fine one. After all, how many picture book ideas can I deluge you with? And I have a nifty idea. Roughly, it's about a girl who thinks she's a loser. I don't want to say more than that right now. I'll think about it some more and get back to you with an outline and one or two chapters. It was a lovely letter and it was my intro- duction to Victory Benneker, the very ap- pealing girl who was to become the heroine of Dreams of Victory . Ellen wouldn't tell me a thing about Dreams of Victory while she was writing it. She is a writer very much in touch with her own emotions about writing. And, as she explained to me later, during the writing, if I had said that the idea was good rather than that it was superb, a thing of beauty and a joy forever, she would have become so discouraged that the writing would have stopped. When the manuscript did arrive, I couldn't wait to see if it worked. I put aside whatever I was doing at the time and began to read. Good news- I loved it. Vic- tory, the girl who loses the class election by a landslide so daydreams of being the first woman President; Victory, who is picked to play the lowly part of Litter in the class play but who dreams of being a famous actress, seemed to me to have been</page><page sequence="5">794 Elementary English picked up bodily from suburban USA and plunked down in the pages of this manu- script. She talked and behaved in her own unique way but she had enough in her of the little girls who often swarmed through my house that I knew that they and- if there were any justice- the adults who rec- ommended that certain books be bought for children would love her. And to make my feelings about the book even more posi- tive, Ellen Conford had done wonders with the relationship between Victory and her parents. It was very refreshing in this day when so many writers who do books for children paint their adult characters as either villains or fools to read Mrs. Con- ford's manuscript, in which parents and children spoke to each other in what I can only describe as the flip-without-being rude, always concerned and usually loving way that I heard around me as I interacted with my own familly. My father got home early because all the elec- tricity in his office builaing went off. "What is that smell?" he asked, sniffing as he hung up his coat. "Your mother isn't trying to bake bread again?" "No, thaťs a pie." "A pie? It doesn't smell like a pie. Not even one of hers." He said that last part under his breath, but I heard him. "Well," I explained, "she was out of regular flour, so she used rye flour." My father clamped his hand down on my shoulder- hard "I'm sure," he said firmly, "it will be delicious." The rest of the dinner wasn't bad, really, but thinking about my mother's pie kind of spoiled it. "And for dessert," she said, placing it on the table with a dramatic flourish, "a home- made peach pie." "Yippee," I whispered. My father glared at me. We all looked down at the pie. The edge of the crust was dark brown. The rest of the crust was gray. The peaches had shriveled up in the oven and looked wrinkled and dry. "Well, it doesn't look very pretty," my mother admitted. "Who cares how it looks?" my father said loyally. "It's how it tastes that counts." My mother cut us each a piece. I think she had a little trouble getting it cut, but she didn't say so. "It's so-dry," I said weakly. "But delicious!" my father added quickly. Suffice it to say that Mrs. Conford made me sympathize with Victory and care what happened to her and her parents. The book was funny and true and once again Ellen Conford had written the kind of book I had wished she would! I knew that now she had found the most proper setting for her gift of writing dialogue. The critics, I'm happy to report, agreed. Dreams of Victory was widely and well reviewed and began to sell well immediately. Once she has the basic idea for a story, Ellen Conford writes quickly. Her plots are, of course, all different but I feel that in the work she has done so far, her themes have been similar: Believe in yourself. You are worthwhile and have something to contribute. You may have a problem, but we all have problems and, basically, life is good and people care what happens to you. This kind of optimism is never in her hands sticky-sweet and her young readers respond postively to what she has to say. So, when not too long after Dreams of Vic- tory was finished, Ellen told me another long novel was about to be sent to me, I was very pleased. Within the week I had had the pleasure of getting to know Felicia Kershenbaum, the heroine of Felicia the Critic. If Victory were unsure of herself, Felicia was a little too sure she knew what was right for her- self and everyone around her. She never hesitated to let others know their short- comings, yet she couldn't seem to under- stand why her criticisms met with hostile reactions. Her mother, trying to help, in- troduced her to the idea of constructive criticism but even that didn't help. Felicia soon discovered that any sort of criticism- even when it is offered with the best in-</page><page sequence="6">Ellen and Me or The Editor as Fisherman's Wife 795 tentions- can put people off. When she makes a list of the things wrong with her cousin's wedding and reception, which is held in the Lagoon Room of Trader Phil's Shangri-La Restaurant (Mrs. Conford does know, doesn't she?) and it falls into the hands of the mother of the bride, Felicia finds herself in very hot water indeed. Felicia does work her problem out to her own satisfaction, and this reader loved the book. I really did, and yet . . . And yet I began to want more. Ellen Conford had shown that she could write both picture-book texts and novels for old- er readers; she had, to borrow a sports re- porter's terminology, all the moves. How- ever, when her third novel, Me and the Terrible Two arrived I began to want to ask for something more in her writing. Dor- rie, the me who meets the terrible two, is an attractive and amusing girl, but I felt that I really didn't know much about her when she wasn't coping with the twin boys with whom she tangles during the course of the book, and the ALA Booklists' review of Felicia had begun, "Ellen Conford's latest misfit is Felicia . . ." Latest? That made it sound like Ellen had written twen- ty novels instead of only a few. Could it be something was needed to make her writ- ing really live for years to come? I then took my step in the process of changing from editor to a character like the fisherman's greedy wife who couldn't let a good thing be. Ellen Conford had come into my professional life when I needed to work with a good, solid writer. She had changed the kind of writing that brought her initial success and did it par- tially at my request. The new books were very good, but I was beginning to think she should enlarge the scope and depth of her writing. I knew that Ellen, for all the funny and positive things she had said and written to me during the course of our relationship, had to be approached cautiously when changes were suggested in her work. She is always willing to listen to a good sug- gestion, but even after four successes she was saying to me in the letter that accom- panied her new text: "Please like it. I was nearly attacked by an ugly mob at the Motor Vehicle Bureau yesterday when I held up the line after the lady who issues duplicate licenses said I must be using an alias. My spirits need restoring and this is so far, I think- I hope- funny and good (I hope, I think)." The message of that letter was clear and that, to come full circle, was why we were having lunch in New York. I felt that eye-to-eye contact was going to be needed when I tried to tell Ellen that I would like to see more depth in her work. I had by this time read the first draft of her fourth novel, The Luck of Pokey Bloom and in it I had found a theme that I thought would illustrate my new thesis well. The main narrative thrust of the book concerns Pokey's attempt to win something -anything- in one of those enter-by-mail contests; yet the book had another theme I thought was worthy of fuller exploration. Pokey, a vivacious ten-year-old, cannot un- derstand why her older brother, who was such a pal last year, now spends long hours lying on his bed staring at the ceiling, mak- ing phone calls so personal that he takes the telephone into the hall closet, and in general seems to want Pokey out of his life. As she stands firmly anchored in her childhood, Pokey watches as her brother drifts away from her and into the often choppy waters of adolescence, and it was this sense of failing that I felt could be explored mored deeply. Felicia and her sister, Marilyn, fought in Felicia the Critic , but the fights were there almost for comic effect. In The Luck of Pokey Bloom the author had presented the reader with a heroine as spunky as the other girls she had written about, but had shown her to be</page><page sequence="7">796 Elementary English more vulnerable and had made the reader get involved with that vulnerability. It was this chord in the novel that I wished Ellen to develop even further. Not to my very great surprise, Ellen knew immediately what I wanted for the manuscript, but she had a few trenchant words of her own to add to the discussion. "John, I know what you mean about the book, and Г11 try to magnify that theme in some places. But I think you have to under- stand something about me as a writer. I am not Dostoevski. I am not even Paul Zindel, and whats more, I dont want to be. It would be wrong for me as a writer to try and turn my talent into something it isn't. Youve got to know your own limitations; and I think I know mine. I wont be overly modest. I have talent, but I think that above all it is a talent to entertain. I have absolutely no message to get across to my readers. Well, perhaps not NO message, but the reason I write books is not to get kids to think the way I do about life. There's enough of that neo-Victorianism going on in children's books right now without me adding another shrill voice to the pack. So while I think you're a super editor and a nice person, please don't ask me to write in a way that will make me feel uncom- fortable. First of all, I couldn't and, second, even if I tried it, you'd probably contract for a book that would wind up one big flop." As Ellen spoke I relearned that most val- uable lesson, which an editor forgets at his peril. Let the writers write and if you can help them to clarify their style and their ideas, fine. But, never, never try to force the writer into the mold of what you want him or her to be. Don't project your aspira- tions for a writer onto his work, unless he agrees with those hopes. Once again the fisherman's wife stood abashed. But not for long. I had only one question for Ellen that afternoon and the answer to it will, I think, affect her career as a writer. By saying that we know our limitations don't we often concoct self-fulfilling pro- phecies? For Ellen Conford to declare too firmly that she knows the limits of her tal- ent may she not impose those limits on a talent that is larger and more multifaceted than she knows? Ellen Conford is young and she is bright and despite the fact that at that luncheon in New York she told me something I should heed, I still feel that it is up to me as her editor to poke at her work a bit here and prod at it a bit there in the hopes that such action will cause an atmosphere between editor and author full of the kind of healthy tension that will enable the au- thor to do her best work. Who knows if I am right? All I do know is that I received another funny letter from Ellen the other day and in it she said that she was at work on another novel. This one is meant for an adolescent audience, but she wouldn't tell me any more about it. After my first reading of the story I am to tell her I love it. Otherwise she will put her head in the dryer and turn the dial to gentle tumble. Then, after I've assured her that the manuscript is going to be a widely successful book, we can get down to what ' if anything I'd like to see changed. My hunch is that I'm going to like the new book very much, and when it finally reaches print, I bet you will too.</page></plain_text>
