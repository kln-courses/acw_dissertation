<plain_text><page sequence="1">Riddle Me This: The Craft and Concept of Animal Mind Graham Cox University of Bath Tony Ashford Bath, U.K. This article examines the relations between methods used in both animal work and study and concepts of animal mind. By "animal work" the authors mean humans and animals working together, and by "animal study" they mean the discipline of ethology, especially the emerging area of cognitive ethology. Within these areas the wide range of conceptions of animal mind includes varying emphases on intelligence, forms of rationality and language, cognition, consciousness, and intentionality. The authors' central concern is to elucidate the vocabulary and the concepts which seem necessary to establishing successful working relationships with sheepdogs and gundogs. Their argument moves toward an emphasis on the appreciation of particular intentional states and recognizes that they invariably deploy elements of a moral vocabulary in achieving creative teamwork performances with dogs and other animals. The article concludes by consid- ering the relevance of accounts of work with animals for associated considerations of intentionality. Intentionality is defined by John Searle (1984, 14-15) as "that feature of certain mental states or events that consists in their . . . being directed at, being about, being of, or representing certain other entities and states of affairs." In Searle's own animal example, he asks us to consider the case of a lion, moving in an erratic path through tall grass. The behaviour of the lion is explicable by saying that it is stalking a wildebeest, its prey. The stalking behavior is caused by a set of intentional states: it is hungry, it wants to eat the wildebeest, it intends to follow the wildebeest with the aim of catching, killing and eating it.

He also draws attention to a particular characteristic of dogs, namely, that among domesticated species, only they "respond strongly to the enormous volume of what we might call 'humanizing' behavior aimed at them by their owners" (1996, 165). Because of our experience of working with dogs, we have chosen to make them the focus of our concerns here. The working Border Collie is, perhaps, the most extreme example of canine exceptionalism. According to Stanley Coren (1994), an American psychologist and dog trainer, they are the smartest of dogs in terms of working intelligence and obedience. They are also comparatively familiar, not least through televised sheepdog trials in series such as One Man and His Dog, now in its twenty-fourth year. While they have become a highly developed form of rural entertainment, sheepdog trials, which are particularly prevalent in upland areas of Britain, are also a serious dog business. Dog and handler compete as a team in front of the public and competition judges. Their purpose is to move groups of sheep through a series of obstacles and complete a number of maneuvers which are characteristic of the demands made by practical work. From the scores available for each element of the work, points are deducted for mistakes and, perhaps, infelicities of working style. The handler stands near the audience and judges, often leaning on a shepherd's crook. The dog appears to move the sheep according to the instruction of the handler, who sends him (most successful trials dogs are male) either clockwise or counter- clockwise to "collect" the sheep, tells him to lie down, drive them on, move them left or right, and so on. Instructions are normally by means of whistles and sometimes through voiced commands. After standing at a distance, the handler walks into the center of the field for the finale, holding open the gate of a small pen into which the sheep are maneuvered by dog and human. The notable features of the successful trial performance are often empha- sized by an accompanying commentary. The successful dog shows both precise obedience and an intense interest in the sheep, while the handler typically displays a particular calmness and authority. The sheep frequently appear as somewhat unwilling though calm participants in the whole drama, hanging together in a close-knit group under the authority of the dog. The level of this accomplishment is, of course, immediately apparent as soon as one sees it being done badly with sheep looking harassed and forever scattering as a consequence. For the judges and experts, all attention focuses on the subtleties of the dog's performance, and his ability to control the sheep in a finely tuned manner. For while the trials performance is inevitably stylized and formalized, its point is still to produce a simulation of the</page><page sequence="3">Cox, Ashford / Riddle Me This 427 practical skills which the working dog needs on a daily basis on the farm. Sheepdog trials may have become a form of popular rural entertainment, but their main aims are still to select particular dogs as breeding stock and to demonstrate their abilities. Indeed, such elements of simulation in the sheep- dog trial can often disguise more subtle aspects of dog work which become more apparent when the dog is working in the less supervised environment of the farm. The trial must be seen as merely the tip of a large and many faceted iceberg. Our own "epistemic authority" (Fuller 1995, 161) in the canine domestic sphere derives from our practical experience of working dogs (Cox 1980, 1987, 1991, 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Cox and Deeley 1995). It is, therefore, a form of experiential expertise based upon sheep farming and working in the shooting field with gundogs. Often, needless to say, such expertise remains substantially-and in many respects, perhaps, ineradicably so-unarticu- lated. Science, in contrast, has more concrete rules of epistemic authority. Such rules are not always, however, conventionally positivist. Claims for replicability and experimental control, those mainstays of traditional behav- ioral psychology, are in some instances substituted. For cognitive ethologists, in particular, epistemic authority entails the appeal to notions such as "ob- served in nature," or "equivalent to nature." Such rules may be more vulner- able to challenge, but they can be defended in a number of ways. Cognitive ethologists, who are often ready to recognize the speculative status of their work, typically introduce a broad mass of supportive evidence and combine or cross-reference it with elements of experiential expertise or "common- sense" understanding. Cognitive ethology therefore constructs its epistemic authority through combining elements of a scientific legitimacy founded on positivist concepts with elements based upon wider and more speculative observation, sometimes heretically including those narratives known as "anecdotes." How might a sheepdog trial be characterized by the traditionally positivist methods of behavioral psychology? Such approaches frequently advocate a law of parsimony: a version of Occam's Razor known as Morgan's Canon which seeks to forbid us interpreting an action as the outcome of an exercise of a higher psychical faculty if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale. In following such a rule, we are likely to attempt hypotheses about the actions of sheepdogs or gundogs based on a pattern of training involving the reconditioning of instinctual responses. Such parsimonious approaches might explain what the sheepdog appears to be doing to our partial satisfaction. For, even if we are not quite sure what subtle senses or learned behavior are at work, we can trust in our ability to discover them sooner or later. And, if we fail to uncover them,</page><page sequence="4">428 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values that is likely to be a result of the environmental complexities which make objective study of the sheepdog's or gundog's activity difficult. Common observations of the sheepdog working under the different and unsimulated demands of the farm present profound challenges both to the parsimonious approach as a method and to any tidy conceptions which we might have of there being a "psychological scale." Indeed, it is just such observation of complex actions like those of the working dog that has been of particular interest to the recently evolved discipline of cognitive ethology. The contrast between behavioral psychology and ethology is well described in the writings of the British ethologist, Willie Thorpe. Thorpe comments on both Morgan's Canon and Skinner's box in his The Origins and Rise of Ethology, arguing that Morgan's Canon is obviously still valuable although nowadays it requires great care in its application. It can lead, for instance, to an extreme reductionist approach to animal behavior which may assume the existence of a clearly definable physiological interpretation when, in fact, no such interpretation is as yet in sight. It can also lead to extraordinary circumlocutions in an attempt to avoid the implication of mental factors in animal behaviour. Indeed, to the modem ethologist dealing with higher animals and faced as he is with ever-increasing evidence for the complexity of perceptual organisation, I feel inclined to say that the very reverse of Morgan's Canon often proves to be the best strategy. (Thorpe 1979, 28-29) While we can, if we so choose, treat an animal-or indeed a person-as a mere mechanism if we do so, as Matthew Elton (1998 [this issue]) argues, we fail to capture the nature or the being of the entity in question. To explain behavior we have no choice but to invoke certain norms. But as Thorpe's account of a visit to Skinner's laboratory undertaken while he was lecturing at Harvard in 1951 makes clear, Skinner sought entirely to eschew any such strategy. Skinner clearly had little use for ethology and what struck me (as a result of watching his pigeons at work in their Skinner boxes) was the great variety of displacement activity, appetite behaviour, etc., which was proceeding all the time and, of course, going unobserved. This was obviously regarded by Skinner as of no interest whatsoever and its investigation a simple waste of time. (Thorpe 1979, 49) Though the points made by Thorpe indicate the ways in which some "precognitive" ethologists were essentially open to cognitive approaches, Griffin and other cognitive ethologists go one step further in opening up areas of speculation about animal mentation. Consequently, the works of Griffin,</page><page sequence="5">Cox, Ashford / Riddle Me This 429 which attempt to justify the cognitive approach, appear to vindicate their own epistemic authority by amassing a vast array of cross-species evidence for all sorts of animal abilities. It is not surprising that such approaches have resulted in attacks from others which echo those made 100 years earlier against the nonrespectable, rampantly anthropomorphic work of George Romanes. But whether such attacks are warranted, Crist's discussion of the descrip- tively rich accounts offered by the Peckhams and Fabre shows that the direct attribution of human mental experiences is not a necessary feature of anthro- pomorphism. She argues, rather, that attributions of awareness, for instance, emerge principally as an effect of the way an action or sequence of actions is perceived and described (1996, 831-32). According to Bekoff (1994, 78), cognitive ethologists are generally inter- ested in comparing thought processes, consciousness, beliefs, and rationality in animals; they are concerned with claims about the evolution of such processes and they emphasize broad rather than narrow taxonomic compari- sons. Moreover, they favor observations and experiments in conditions that are as close as possible to the natural environment where selection has occurred and maintain that field studies of animals that include careful observation and experiment can inform studies of animal cognition and that cognitive ethology does not have to be brought into the laboratory to be made respectable. Through the focus that we have put on practical work with dogs, we find ourselves firmly within the domestic sphere of relations between humans and domesticated animals. This is an area of common public experience in which appeals to natural observation may combine or compete with appeals to experiential expertise. "Traditional" ethologists have tended to keep clear of the domestic sphere. Instead, they set out a friendly division and collaboration between those who work with animals in some form of laboratory setting and those who try to observe animals in their "natural" setting. The domestic sphere, however, presents us with clear and obvious contrasts with both the laboratory and "the wild." In an article about working sheepdogs originally published in New Scientist in 1981, Gail Vines wrote: Sheepdogs present a unique opportunity to study the interactions of genetically inspired behavioural tendencies and complex cognitive capabilities which are all involved in natural social behaviour such as hunting in packs. The triangle of man, dog and sheep provides an unusually accessible window into this behaviour as, long domesticated, dogs are perhaps unique among animals in both their eagerness and their ability to understand people. Detailed experi- mental studies of working sheepdogs are likely to give us many exciting insights into the newest area of research in animal behaviour, christened by Donald Griffin "cognitive ethology." (1984, 297)</page><page sequence="6">430 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values As we have already argued, the parsimonious behaviorist account of the sheepdog trial may appear reasonably satisfactory. However, we must em- phasize that such an approach would be seriously impoverished and would, inevitably, miss some essential elements of what is going on. Moreover, a sheepdog handler whose methods followed a parsimonious behaviorist logic could expect no success as a trialer. Beyond the quasi-laboratory setting of the trial field, the limitations of both concepts and method become both profound and immediately obvious in the daily work arena of sheepdogs. Accounts from working shepherds emphasize the cognitive abilities of the sheepdog, and its capacity to reason in the sense of "working it out." These accounts frequently focus on the dog's reactions to the behavior of sheep, including the alteration of its behavior when faced with sheep which show differing levels of aggression, as well as many other subtle judgments which they make independently of any super- vision. Vines recounts a common anecdote of the ultimate prowess of a really good dog: Dogs experience particular difficulty when faced with recalcitrant ewes with lambs. One such ewe which had split off from the main flock refused to be moved and faced the dog square on, stamping its hooves. The dog returned to the main flock, cut off several sheep, and brought them over to the stubborn ewe. The ewe promptly joined this group and the dog was able to move them all back to the main flock. (1984, 297) Accounts of this sort are very common, providing stories of feats of initiative in which the dog had never been trained, often carried out at great distance from the shepherd. While winter work on hill farms provides extreme challenges, the most technically rigorous working conditions for the sheepdog are in summer gathers, where dogs cover great distances to search out and collect flocks of ewes and lambs from rough terrain, under conditions utterly different from the trial field. Such actions, together with the style of most "training" methods, seem to confer both an element of self-awareness to the dog for authors such as Vines (1984, 296) who subscribe to Donald Griffin's (1984) paradigm of "cognitive ethology," and a strong sense of intentionality as characterized by Searle's description of a hunting sequence. This is certainly the case for many sheepdog handlers, who often prefer to talk in terms of "teaching" rather than training. Eric Halsall (1985), in the chapter of his book on sheepdogs entitled "Method is Genius," emphasizes that those who fail to learn from their dogs and who quell whatever initiative they may possess deny the possibility of really effective work in anything other than the necessarily artificial competi- tive sphere. This debate has its exact parallel in the world of working gundogs</page><page sequence="7">Cox, Ashford / Riddle Me This 431 (Cox 1995a) where, at the highest levels, competition is in no sense artificial and where achieving a productive tension between absolute obedience and initiative is a precondition for effectiveness. Referring to sheepdogs, Halsall writes: Such trainers of these "yo-yo" dogs, pulled hither and thither on a whistled command, have much to answer for in the evolution of working dogs. Their creations were false for when taken to the moor and running out of sight, and consequently out of command, they were lost. The power to think for them- selves had been taken out of them. This type of collie has no future and does not last, but its use in planned breeding programmes retards the overall status of the breed. (Halsall 1985, 104-5) These claims are inevitably provocative; for many, they are redolent of unacceptably anthropomorphic assumptions. But we must recognize that the handler's assumptions about the dog's mental abilities are of central interest, so consideration of these issues is unavoidable. There are good reasons why the ability to "read a dog" is seen as the mark of a good handler. An alternative form of assumption can, moreover, be put in terms of cognitive ethology. While shepherds, trainers, and ethologists all recognize the importance of the dog's attitude to the sheep, Vines goes so far as to describe the dog as "appearing to act as 'managemental' ethologist" (1984, 297). Such a descrip- tion is justified by observation of the dog's behavior: in this instance, the dog's method of recovering the errant single ewe and lamb described earlier. The successful working dog demonstrates an endless fascination with sheep and "studies" them intently at every opportunity. When working, the dog appears to anticipate the behavior of the sheep. This is done without any supervision from the handler; indeed, most sheepdog handlers would never claim to be able to guess what a sheep is likely to do as well as their dog. Even if they could do so and act on that basis, the delay in instruction would be likely to make control of the sheep impossible. The significance accorded to "eye" in sheepdogs has its counterpart in the discussions in gundog circles of "gamefinding" ability (Cox 1995b). Consider the following episode. As guns and handlers walk a field of sugar beet, a pheasant is shot and a retriever is sent to collect the bird. The dog goes to the fall but, almost immediately, begins to move away. Convinced the bird is dead, the handler blows the stop whistle, but the dog, which typically obeys this most significant of commands implicitly, countermands the repeated order. The handler, realizing the pointlessness of calling the dog back to the fall, leaves the dog to work a line almost the length of the field before collecting the strongly running cock bird and bringing it tenderly to hand. A fine retrieve born of an appropriately managed productive tension.</page><page sequence="8">432 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values With this example in mind, we can now turn from the sheepdog to explore further the implications of the retrieving and tracking work of scenting dogs. It is important to emphasize the awesome sensory powers of the dog, who lives in a world of scent which we can barely imagine or comprehend. In attempting to gain some sense of this scent world, we also have to recognize its essential capriciousness. Although dogs can smell in extraordinary detail, with scent conveying multiple messages to the dog rather as a chord is composed of a number of distinct notes, occasional climatic conditions- particularly in winter-can also mean, on occasion, that there can be no scent at all. In such circumstances, dogs may be unable to locate something almost literally in front of their noses. These complexities often lead to confusion and misunderstanding. This is why the gaining of wisdom with regard to scent begins with the acknowledgment of its local and particular character. That, in turn, means forswearing commonly heard overgeneralized assessments which purport to characterize whole days as "good" or "bad" (Cox 1980). These sorts of complex inconsistencies mean that in practical scent work, the cooperative success of dog and handler depends on several factors. The handler works with some general awareness of the scented world which the dog perceives and can guess at the microclimatic effects which describe its dimensions. As with the sheepdog, the handler also has to work with a strong sense of the dog's cognitive abilities. In the case of scent work, rather than studying sheep behavior, the dog is working out the implications of its scented experience. The handlers also have some advantages over the dog, in terms of a wider vision, as well as an alternative pattern of clues to be worked out. Central to the successful resolution of these different perspec- tives in the scenting trial, and in the whole process of dog training, is the element of "trust" placed in the dog by the handler. The stylish worker, through body and tail action, presents key clues about what it is doing at any given moment. The handler must, as we have emphasized already, read the dog and act accordingly. This may, of course, as in the case we have just outlined, mean refraining from any whistled or voiced intervention. Indeed, such a strategy is almost always the appropriate one so long as a dog is in the right area, is experienced, and is patently trying (Cox 1987). Animals can, on occasion, make, as it were, a pretense of working, and it is not for nothing that the characterization "honest" is often used by those who handle dogs or ride horses in competition. So when Wittgenstein asks, "What is the natural expression of an inten- tion?" and responds to his own question by saying "Look at a cat when it stalks a bird; or a beast when it wants to escape" (1968, 165), we might add, as another instance, the qualities of style which make it possible to "read" the work of a scenting dog. Such features of the activity of effectively</page><page sequence="9">Cox, Ashford / Riddle Me This 433 handling a scenting dog are central to the following account of dog scent work by Vicki Hearne: Once or twice a week, [Belle, Hearne's tracking Pit Bull Terrier] and I meet with a group of dogs and handlers who lay tracks for one another and provide the discussion and speculations that help make one's own errors perceptible. One time we were working in some abandoned vineyards, in an area several miles square. Our small company included two police officers and their dogs, who were working on scouting problems. One of the dogs was Packer, a fine, solid-working German Shepherd. His handler was Officer Riddle. Another handler, playing the part of the hiding suspect, left the immediate area to hide downwind from the dog-man team. Officer Riddle, when told that the suspect was hidden, emerged with Packer, put on the harness and cued Packer to search into the wind. Packer stiffened and started towards a line of cypress trees that had been planted some decades earlier as a windbreak. Officer Riddle followed him. Then Packer slowed, checked some nearby grape vines, working now across the wind and then with the wind to his back. Officer Riddle, figuring that there was nothing in that direction a human being could hide in and that Packer couldn't possibly be working air scent from that direction because that wasn't where the wind was, stopped Packer authori- tatively and redirected him. Packer, checked and redirected to work into the wind, began romping about, plainly playing the clown. The handler was advised by the supervising trainer to call the dog to heel, without any reprimanding. Fifty yards to his left, the "suspect" emerged from a low drainage ditch that wasn't visible to Officer Riddle. We were all silent, contemplating the implications of this breach of trust for Packer's future work. (Hearne 1987, 101-2) This account, presented in a thoughtful and readable book, explicitly recognizes that the vocabulary necessary for satisfactorily characterizing the relationship which makes scent work possible is in certain key respects a moral one. Officer Riddle has, as it were, failed to respect Packer's moral integrity. The use of words like "honesty" and "trust" is more than simply appropriate; we have to engage in the sorts of "extraordinary circumlocu- tions" identified by Thorpe (1979) if we are to avoid using them (see also Crist 1996, 801-7, 817). Hearne makes a number of key points about the dimensions and implications of the domestic sphere, and her case for its significance goes considerably beyond that offered by Vines. Endorsing Hearne's arguments about the importance of language and trust in the domestic sphere seems to entail that to a degree we consider dogs in a working relationship with humans "as if" they were moral agents. The dogs' position within the overlapping spheres of intentionality which we have identified seems to imply such a conclusion. The language of moral agency is simply the one which delivers most cogently the richly faceted and inventive human-dog context. And lest this be considered inappropriate, we</page><page sequence="10">434 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values should note, as Dennett does, that "Dogs and only dogs among domesticated species respond strongly to the enormous volume of what we might call 'humanizing' behavior aimed at them by their owners" such that "they begin to develop the very organizational features that are otherwise the province of socialized human beings" (1996, 164-65). In that sense dogs are, in Scruton's characterization, "honorary members of our moral community," although he is reluctant to confer on them the sort of individuality which would make it coherent to consider them as having rights and duties (1996, 40). Scruton's reservation is, however, not the one which is most commonly made and which Hearne herself notes throughout her book: namely, that approaches to dog training such as hers involve a form of an unacceptable authoritarianism. For though the choice of authoritarian descriptive language on the part of some dog trainers may be uncongenial, it is clear that respect is vital to advanced practical work. Indeed, such authority-which cannot, of course, simply be imposed-is a precondition for the "growth" that Hearne speaks of so engagingly. The respect must, in short, be genuinely mutual. Such a stance is, of course, wholly compatible with the recognition of the dog's cognitive integrity; more than that, such recognition is essential in the domestic sphere in which dog and human interact. Hearne, with considerable justification, characterizes those who raise such objections and who display a misplaced and ultimately damaging concern for their dogs as "humaniacs." Ruud Hendriks is making a similar point when he speaks of an autistic person "coming alive" when offered a structured environment (1998 [this issue]). For him, too, a naively humanistic stance which involves an unin- tended indifference regarding the "otherness" of autistic people is as likely to be inadequate as its naive mechanistic counterpart which risks reducing interactions in a ward to mere behavioral problem solving. As his account makes clear, autistic people are only machinelike in a metaphorical sense and only nonsocialized in a relative sense (Hendriks 1998). So if we are to do justice to the possibility within autism for its being a distinct form of life we have to recognize, as Hearne does, that kindness alone is misplaced. Struc- ture, meanwhile, though a necessary precondition for growth, can never be sufficient. By invoking the insights of Wittgenstein, Hearne is appealing to yet another form of epistemic authority based on the integrity of philosophical argument. The evidence from practical dog work clearly impinges on a range of questions which are central to the science and philosophy of animal mind. Looking from the perspective of practical dog work, one can only concur with Hearne when she complains of the poverty of the animal consciousness debate. This poverty results largely from the residual straitjacket of behav- iorist methods, and attention to the issues raised by Griffin and his supporters</page><page sequence="11">Cox, Ashford / Riddle Me This 435 is likely to tell us something much more useful about the working dog, or, at least, it will make public and articulate what the best dog trainers already know. There are, of course, exceptions to this rather broad and generalized disappoint- ment in the animal consciousness debate. Radner and Radner (1989), for instance, unpack the specifically Cartesian dimensions of these conundrums with great skill. Similarly, Searle's work on consciousness and intentionality tells us more about animal mind than he chooses to state explicitly, and we turn now to consider the relevance of some of his arguments. In the context of the argument about intersecting spheres of intentionality being presented here, it would be only too easy to recount examples and to succumb to the temptation of seeking to advance the argument by accumu- lating instances and interpretive descriptions of action sequences. As Hearne and others (see Dennett 1996, 164) frequently emphasize, those who work with dogs tend to tell "dog stories," which are forms of anecdotal account. We do have many stories of our own, but clarity and the limitations of space demand that we resist any temptation to recount them. For those who work with dogs, such accounts are a way of conveying beliefs and experience. The dog story is a metaphor for our, for the most part, unstated sense of what we and the dogs are "really doing." Among "dog people"-those who see themselves as "working" with dogs, rather than keeping them as pets-this understatement is an important convention, a protection against the privacy of our relations with animals, the essence of which may, in any case, be unspeakable in just that sense which Wittgenstein acknowledged with his wry suggestion that "If a lion could talk, we could not understand him" (1968, 223). These relations and the interpretive understandings which are possible are unspeakable in a literal sense, not because they are nonlinguistic, but because they work within a different scope of intentionality from most human relations. This general habit of understatement is also testimony to our communicative inadequacies and rudimentary skills, albeit sometimes ame- liorated by a grounding in the niceties of philosophical discourse, but more often conveyed in fictional narratives. The particular quality of Heame's book rests on her articulation and combination of just those elements. Rather than retell yet more anecdotal accounts, however, we will instead buttress those we have already presented by drawing on a philosophical account. In his explication of consciousness and intentionality, John Searle is ready to suggest that there is every reason to suppose that there is "something going on in there" in humans and higher mammals. Nonhuman animals are not at the center of his attention. But nested within his arguments we can find a story about animals and intentionality which makes sense both in terms of our working experience and in relation to ethological approaches. Searle suggests that "the biologically primary forms of Intentionality are</page><page sequence="12">436 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values perception and action. Then further down the road come memory and prior intentions, and only very derivatively do we get beliefs and desires" (1991, 88). This spectrum of intentionality is inherently related to the use of language. Searle goes on to clarify a critical point: Anything that I say has to be said in a language, and any articulation I give of more primitive prelinguistic forms of Intentionality will always be done in language. So, it looks like I am simply using linguistic forms to explicate Intentionality, and thus it looks like the Intentionality is intrinsically linguistic. But now ask yourself, "How did the speech acts get this extraordinary shape?" and "Why is it that psychological states have exactly the same shape?" Is it because mankind first learnt how to talk and then learned how to experience, feel and think? I think the answer is that biological forms of Intentionality are primary; linguistic forms are derived. Of course, for any developed speaker of a language there is an inextricable intermingling of the linguistic and the intentional; and that is just another way of saying that most of our intentional states come to us linguistically and could not exist without linguistic forms of expression. The picture that I have is this: a human child begins with prelinguistic forms of Intentionality. By a kind of bootstrapping effect the child acquires primitive linguistic expressions of that Intentionality. But a little bit of language goes a long way; and the child develops a richer Intentionality which it could not have developed without linguistic forms. This richer Intentionality enables a further richer linguistic development which in turn enables richer Intentionality. All the way up to the developed adult, there is a complex series of developmental and logical interactions between Intentionality and language. Most forms of adult Intentionality are essentially linguistic. But the whole edifice rests on biological primitive forms of prelinguistic Intentionality. (Searle 1991, 94) To appreciate that in speaking of intentionality we are talking in terms of a spectrum, we can note, with Wittgenstein, that even at the apex of the "whole edifice," matters are anything but straightforward for, as he notes parenthetically, "the most explicit expression of intention is by itself insuffi- cient evidence of intention" (1968, 164). But whatever view we may take of matters "at the apex," it is clear that the philosophical analysis (see also Dennett 1996, 19-57) of biologically primitive forms of prelinguistic inten- tionality is appropriate to the discussion of our relations with animal mind. It provides an expression for our own subjective experiences of dog work, in which we interact both with the dog's prelinguistic intentionality and with a form of linguistic intentionality comparable to but different from that of the child. The outward appearance of dog work may well seem to consist only of the communication and execution of a very limited set of linguistic commands, but they constitute only a small aspect of the whole linguistic relationship between dog and handler. The main event consists of the dog's</page><page sequence="13">Cox, Ashford / Riddle Me This 437 performance of its primary forms of intentionality in terms of its own perception and action. The account is, moreover, strongly congruent with the common descrip- tions of sheepdog and scenting work which we have outlined and which emphasize the process of learning from the dog as much as teaching it. Thus, the primary interest of the sheepdog, for instance, is in intentional perception which sounds very much like the dog studying the sheep. Through our own observation of the dog's intentional actions, we in turn learn about the behavior of sheep in response to the dog, and can develop our own intentions which bear on the accomplishment of a collective project. Within these processes, the individuality of the dog is most apparent and the impossibility of any fully effective training algorithm is demonstrated. Instead, we can open up the possibility of really recognizing what makes dog work both successful and interesting. We should not, perhaps, be surprised that we are unable to specify any differentia specifica between dogs and humans. As P. J. Hiett's (1995) dis- cussion of humans, animals, and machines shows, there is no key difference that we can point to. Only the demands of effective description (Elton 1998) imply such a perspective. Indeed, as Crist's discussion of the Peckhams and Fabre shows in relation to naturalist's accounts of animal action, it need not stem from a philosophy (1996, 824). Philosophy is, however, lending it increasingly powerful support. References Bekoff, Mark. 1994.
