<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY IN MOROCCO AND ITS "POLICY OF RACES" IN FRENCH WEST AFRICA: COMMANDANT PAUL MARTY (1882-1938) PESSAH SHINAR Abstract Virtually from the beginning of the protectorate (1912), the French in Morocco attempted to seal off the Berber-speaking tribes from the penetration of Islam and of the Arabic language. The present paper argues that this policy (the "Berber policy") was modeled on a similar policy (the "policy of races") adopted by the French in West Africa at the beginning of the twentieth century, the main difference being that in West Africa it was the "animists" who were to be sealed off. In both cases, the French acted as they did in order to ensure the permanence of their rule. It is argued that Paul Marty, the eminent authority on Islam in West Africa, was a key figure in the implementation of these policies in both regions. I The purpose of the present paper is to draw attention to a significant aspect of France's Islamic policy in Africa and to the man who was a major exponent of that policy and an active participant in its elaboration. That aspect is the fundamental concordance of some basic principles of French native policy, as conceived and carried into practice at the beginning of the twentieth century in French West Africa1 (especially in Senegal and the Sudan), with those adopted eleven years later with regard to the Berber-speaking tribes of Morocco.2 Correspondence: Pessah Shinar, Asian and African Studies, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mt.

The French saw these as under threat of penetration by sharifian justice and shaft a law, makhzan administration and the Arabic language. The French hoped eventually to draw the Berbers into the orbit of French law, administration, language and culture. Their policy culminated in the notorious Berber dahir (Classical Arabic zahir, the edict of a Moroccan sovereign), which was issued on 16 May 1930. Courts applying Berber customary law were already in existence at that time. The effect of the dahir was to give these eighty-four courts, whose jurisdiction covered some 700,000 Berbers, a new and more solid legal basis. In the eyes of the Moroccan nationalists, the most objectionable feature of the edict was that it empowered the French courts in Morocco to try all serious crimes committed in Berber tribal territory - a right previously reserved to the Sharifian Supreme Court at Rabat.4 The dahir was only reluctantly promulgated by the Sultan, who was under pressure from the Residency, and it was presented by the Young Moroccans as a move to de-Islamize the Berbers, divide the Moroccan nation, and curtail the sovereignty of the Sultan. The edict set in motion an unprecedented protest movement in urban Morocco, and one that had repercussions throughout the Islamic world. This in turn triggered the emergence of nationalism in Morocco and thus constituted a turning point in the contemporary history of the Maghrib.5 The man who embraced, actively promoted and expounded both France's Islamic policy in French West Africa and its Berber policy 3 On the Berbers and the Berber question, see the references listed in Shinar 1983, 461, s.v.

He served six years in Tunisia, followed by two years with the French army in Morocco as military interpreter, and close to nine years as adviser on Islamic affairs and controller of military and administrative correspondence in French West Africa. In West Africa he worked in both Dakar and the interior. His stay in West Africa was followed by ten years in the service of the French Protectorate in Morocco (1920 to 1931). He began his Moroccan period as Director of the College Moulay Idris at Fes, and then moved on to become head of the department for the study of the Berber questions {bureau d'etudes des questions berberes) and for the elaboration of a Berber statute at the Direction des Affaires Indigenes at Rabat. In 1931 he was removed from the post and transferred to Tunis, where he ended his days seven years later, at the age of fifty-six. To the best of my knowledge, students of the contemporary Maghrib have nowhere noted the concordance between the Islamic policy of France in French West Africa and its Berber policy in Morocco; nor have they noted the fact that it is the person of Paul Marty that links the two. This silence may perhaps be due to the traditional division between African studies relating to countries north of the Sahara and those relating to countries south of the Sahara. Another possible reason for the silence is that to the extent that outside precedents were sought for the Berber policy in Morocco, attention naturally focused on Algeria, where Greater Kabylia could and did provide the French with a model to emulate.7 In contrast, French policy in the Aures Mountains offered to the Berberists an example of what was to be avoided. In the Aures, the Governor General of Algeria was seen as bent on imposing shaft a law and the use of Arabic on the Shawiya Berbers ("coraniser les Berberes"), who supposedly wanted none of either.8 In fact, the Kabyle precedent loomed large in the consciousness of those who advocated the Berber policy for Morocco. Most of them had seen service in Algeria and 6 The biographical information that follows is taken from Bercher 1938 and from Marty's military service record (Carnet de Service) in the War Ministry archives at the Chateau de Vincennes, Paris. 7 Ageron 1968, 1294, s.v. Kabyles. 8 For a critique of France's Islamic policy in the Aures, see Marcy 1939.</page><page sequence="4">36 PESSAH SHINAR they employed Kabyles to promote relations with the Moroccan Berbers. General awareness of Kabyle particularism had been sharpened by the insurrection of 187 19 and by the appearance (two years later) of the first edition of Hanoteau and Letourneux's famous study La Kabylie et les coutumes kabyles. The authors of this scholarly work did not share the illusions of the Kabylophiles, but it nevertheless soon became the "Bible" of the French law-courts in Kabylia.10 On the other hand, France's success in assimilating the Kabyles was underlined by the fact that she could enlist selected Kabyle evolues to help her reconcile their Moroccan brethren with the French Protectorate.11 One of these evolues, Nehlil, was even appointed co- director of what was to become the Institute of Higher Moroccan Studies in Rabat. It is not only the link between Morocco and French West Africa that has been overlooked. Oblivion and silence have also been the lot of Paul Marty. Except in Ageron's article on France's Berber policy,12 which refers several times to Marty, he has received hardly more than a passing mention from the Maghribists. Such disregard seems to the present writer to be quite unjustified. Marty was not merely a senior colonial officer who was sacked because the policy he promoted met with dismal failure, but also an outstanding researcher and perhaps the most prolific writer ever on West African Islam. His dozen or so volumes on Islam and the tribes in Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea (Futa Djallon), Zinder, the Sudan, Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger and the emirate of the Trarzas and the Moorish tribe of the Brakna, published between 1915 and 1930, total over 4000 octavo pages.13 They are excellently documented, clear, precise, meticulous and exhaustive. They constitute the most complete work of reference that we possess on Islam and on tribal society in French West Africa, and have provided a solid basis for all subsequent research. So, for instance, Marty is referred to twenty-three times in Trimingham's study of Islam in West Africa (1959) and forty- eight times in Gouilly's (1952). By publishing his work in the Revue 9 For this momentous event, see the references listed in Shinar 1983, 330- 7, and especially Rinn 1891 and Robin 1901. 10 For a critique of this work, see Bousquet 1950. 11 On the creation of this class of evolues, see Colonna 1975. 12 Ageron 1971, reprinted in Ageron 1972, 109-48. 13 For a detailed listing of the individual volumes of this work, see Gouilly 1952, 285-6.</page><page sequence="5">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 37 du Monde Musulman,H Marty became the chief contributor to the first European journal to be wholly dedicated to the study of the modern Islamic world. Together with Louis Massignon, he was a close collaborator of the founder of the journal, A. Le Chatelier.15 When Le Chatelier was about to relinquish his chair of Islamic Sociology at the College de France, Marty was unanimously de- signated to succeed him after the incumbency of his friend Louis Massignon.16 The above-mentioned publications by no means exhaust Marty's scholarly output. Already in 1905, at the age of twenty-three, he published a study of some Arabic dialects of South Tunisia, the fruit of several years of research in that region; this work helped him two years later (June 1907) to earn the licence es-lettres at Aix- en-Provence.17 During his stay in French West Africa he published, among other things, studies of the Medersa of St.-Louis (1913) and of the native policy of William Ponty (1915), about both of which we shall have more to say. Marty's experience in Morocco also yielded a number of publications, chief among them a collection of essays entitled Le Maroc de demain (1925). The subjects it deals with include the Qarawiyyln University, the College Moulay Idris, the educated youth of Morocco, the Berber policy of the Protectorate and the social structure of the city of Fes. This book has a direct bearing on our subject and forms, indeed, the centerpiece of our documentation. After his return to Tunisia, and apart from his official duties in the French Army, Marty continued to contribute to the Revue Africaine and the Revue Tunisienne. He was in fact co- opted to the editorial board of the latter. In view of the above, a comparison between the Islamic policy devised and implemented in Dakar and the one devised and implemented in Rabat, as well as an outline of the ideas of the man 14 The Revue du Monde Musulman was founded in 1906 and continued publication until 1926, during which period sixty volumes appeared. It was replaced in 1927 by the Revue des Etudes Islamiques. 15 On this pioneer of French penetration into Morocco, who was also the author of an important work on French West Africa (Le Chatelier 1 899), see Messal 1931. 16 It is not clear why the electors already designated Massignon's successor at the time of his appointment. Massignon, a famous French Islamist, was the author of La Passion de al-Halldj (1922), which dealt with the martyrdom of an early Muslim mystic. He was an old friend of Marty's. 17 Bercher 1938, 15.</page><page sequence="6">38 PESSAH SHINAR who represented a personal union between the two, will not, we hope, appear entirely unwarranted. First, however, a word of caution. The present paper, like Ageron's article of 1971, is based almost entirely on published material, primarily on Marty's own writings. I do not know whether the French archived material on this subject is as "absolutely inaccessible" today as it was at the time when Ageron wrote. In any case, a study of Paul Marty, to be exhaustive, would have to be based not only on documents from the French official archives,18 but also, and not least, on the private archives and recollections of the Marty family. Much that pertains to Marty remains shrouded in uncertainty. His early ideological conditioning and thinking, the exact nature and results of his various duties and missions, his interventions, if any, in the inner councils of colonial government, his relations with his superiors (and especially with the Governors General of French West Africa and the Residents General of Morocco), the weight that his opinions carried at the decision-making level, his personal share in the formulation and implementation of the Berber policy - none of these can be ascertained from the published sources. Hence much of what we have to say on such topics, being based on allusions and inferences, is tentative and subject to revision. The present paper, however, is not a biography of Marty. It is merely an analysis, based on the testimony of his own writings, of his involvement in the native policy of French West Africa and of Morocco, particularly as regards Islam and the Berbers. And on that basis, we can offer a number of statements whose validity, we believe, is not likely to be seriously affected by subsequent research. Four of these may be made at the outset: 1 . Marty was not the inventor or initiator either of the West African "policy of races" or of the Moroccan Berber policy. Both had already been formulated and were in operation when he first set foot in Dakar and Rabat, respectively. 18 Among the official archives that contain information about Marty may be mentioned those in Paris (Quay d'Orsay, War Ministry in Vincennes and the Centre de Hautes Etudes Administrative sur l'Afrique et l'Asie Modernes), possibly also those in Aix-en-Provence, and almost certainly those in Dakar at the Institut Fondamental de l'Afrique Noire (IFAN). According to an oral communication from the former director of IFAN, M. Morel, there is nothing of relevance to our subject in his institute. I believe nevertheless that further investigation might prove profitable.</page><page sequence="7">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 39 2. These policies were in complete harmony with his own convictions and judgments concerning the Arabs, the Berbers, Islam, animism, and the role of the anti-Islamic "Latin school."19 He wholeheartedly espoused both the West African policy and the Moroccan one, and promoted them to the best of his ability. 3. In Marty's view, the two policies were closely related. The dangers that threatened the French presence in French West Africa were much the same as those that threatened it in Morocco. So too, in his view, were the means that should be adopted in order to obviate those dangers. 4. Since Marty had a significant share in advocating and elaborating the Berber policy, he must also bear part of the responsibility for its failure. II This is not the place to describe, however briefly, the ethnic and religious composition of French West Africa at the turn of the century,20 nor to trace the vicissitudes of French native policy there prior to the great shift from a pro-Islamic to a pro-fetishist (or pro- animist) trend. This shift began in 1903 and was the work of two Governors General, William Ponty and his successor Joseph Clozel. The present paper confines itself to three tasks. 1 . We will set out the considerations that produced both the above- mentioned policy shift in Dakar and the Berber policy in Morocco. We will also list the measures taken in both countries to implement these new policies, and show that they were parallel. 2. We will present Marty's own thinking on these policies and their ideological foundations. 3. We will offer some reflections on the contribution of the West African experience to a better understanding of the course of the Berber policy. We begin by setting out the points of concordance between the policies followed by the French in the two regions. On the doctrinal 19 The Latin school is discussed in section III below. 20 On this subject we have the study of Le Chatelier 1899, the much more detailed volumes of Marty 1920-21, and a short survey appended to Glozel 1913.</page><page sequence="8">40 PESSAH SHINAR level the following ideas were shared by the policy makers in French West Africa and in Morocco. 1 . Orthodox Islam, including its modern fundamentalist outgrowths, is political and universalist by nature. Because of its innate expansionist urge and its tendency to unify the Muslim peoples into a monolithic bloc, Islam constitutes a challenge and a grave danger to French colonial domination everywhere. A similar danger is posed, to one degree or another, by the Sufi orders. 2. Rural Islam, whether in Barbary or in Black Africa, differs from orthodox Islam in two respects. First, it separates Muslim beliefs and observances from Islamic law and its accompanying social order and way of life. Rural Islam adopts some of the former but disregards much of the latter. Second, rural Islam consists of a thick sub-stratum of animistic or fetishist beliefs and rites, covered by a thin layer of notions, ceremonies, names and Qur'anic expressions borrowed and adapted from Islam. Because of the extreme particularism of the Berbers in the Maghrib and of the ethnic groups in West Africa, the proportions of these ingredients in the mix vary from village to village and from tribe to tribe. Each variant faithfully reflects the mentality, customs and traditions of the particular group. 3. The bearers of Islam who are closest to the Berbers and to the Islamic black ethnic groups in West Africa are neither the doctors of the law, nor the shaykte of the great Sufi orders, but rather the obscure marabouts attached to local z^wiyas, and/or to the tombs of local saints. Their knowledge of Islam and Arabic is mostly rudimentary, but they are well adapted to local conditions and identify themselves with the interests of their local group. In contrast to the bearers of orthodox Islam, they pose no threat to French dominion in Africa. 4. The "true" Muslims, despite their dominant status in Morocco and West Africa, are a minority amidst a population that is either pagan (in West Africa) or else no more than superficially Islamized (in Morocco). The pagans are opposed to the penetration of short a law, maraboutic Islam and the Arabic language, and their power of resistance has traditionally proved sufficient to hold Islam in check, thus establishing a kind of equilibrium. Until the coming of the Europeans, the allegedly steady, irresistible advance of orthodox Islam in Africa was in fact nothing but an illusion or a myth.</page><page sequence="9">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 41 5. European implantation and domination inevitably played into the hands of orthodox Islam. By establishing peace, security and a territorial unity that transcended village and tribe; by introducing modern methods of communication and commerce; by pref- erentially employing members of the Muslim political elite in the administration and relying on them for their contacts with the fetishist populace; and by recognizing the superiority of Islam over fetishism, the Europeans provided a powerful incentive for the fetishists to embrace Islam, thus upsetting the traditional balance in favor of the enemy of the Europeans - orthodox Islam. 6. Fetishism in West Africa, and ancient Berber customs and traditions in the Maghrib, are true and original manifestations of the genius of the group. They alone, therefore, can and should form the basis for spiritual, cultural and social advancement, and they must be protected from "foreign" (i.e., Islamic) interference. 7. Orthodox Islam constitutes a barrier to social progress, the adoption of Western civilization and assimilation to French culture. This is not true, however, either of West African animism or of North African Berber customs and traditions, since these customs and beliefs, being unwritten and not otherwise fixed, can be changed, amended and replaced by others, as indeed they have been in the course of the centuries. 8. It follows from this that the Berber and animist populations are entitled to an equal share of the benefits bestowed by France; and it further follows that France's mission civilisatrice is more likely to succeed among the animists and the Berbers than it is among the orthodox Muslims. These people are more likely than the Muslims ultimately to become true sons of France, thus ensuring the permanence of the French hold on both possessions. Not all supporters of the above policies subscribed to all of these tenets. Some, for instance, differed in their evaluation of fetishism and of Berber customs. Yet all agreed on the ultimate goal: France must stop the advance of Islam and of the Arabic language. This was a conviction that by dint of repetition tended to become axiomatic. These considerations, insofar as they relate to Morocco, are, of course, familiar to students of the contemporary Maghrib. That they also apply to the West African counterpart can be seen in statements to the same effect that are to be found in a variety of contemporaneous sources.21 21 See, for instance, Le Chatelier 1899; Binger 1906; Quellien 1910; Clozel</page><page sequence="10">42 PESSAH SHINAR On the practical level, both in Morocco and in French West Africa, officials drew conclusions from the above premises that led to the following results. 1. The customary laws of the fetishist and Berber groups were systematically collected, written down and edited. All officials dealing with native affairs were enjoined to master this material. The extent to which this material was actually published is not entirely clear.22 In Morocco the same process had begun in the early years of the twentieth century. 2. Customary law courts were set up whose competence included personal status, succession, commerce and other civil matters. As regards crimes, and especially homicide, French law applied. The reason for this was that the authorities wanted to put an end to certain barbarous modes of punishment. 3. A number of shaft' a courts were replaced by customary law- courts. 4. The use of Arabic for recording the deliberations and the decisions of the customary law courts was prohibited. Arabic was also banned from official correspondence between the authorities and the communities that were recognized as customary law tribes. 5. A special surveillance system was set up to keep track of the movements and activities of tdlih and Muslim missionaries among customary law tribes. 6. The French administrator or officer was introduced into the native judicial system. In West Africa, he appeared as a presiding judge, in Morocco as a commissaire du gouvernment and secretary- notary to the judicial jamffa. The option granted to the people of French West Africa of seeking redress in European law courts resembled, to a certain degree, the arrangements specified in the crucial para. 6 of the Berber dahir of 1930. 7. In the administrative sphere, the particularism and autonomy of both the individual Berber tribes and of the West African ethnic groups were strengthened. Direct contact was established between the tribe or ethnic group and the French administrator, thus 1913; Marty 1915; Brevie 1923; Delafosse 1922a and 1922b; and Gouilly 1952. 22 "Since 1895 the attempt has been made to draw up codes of customary law (de rediger les coutumes). But only in a few places has this immense task really been carried out. Codification (la redaction) began only in 1938. Few texts were published and the level of accuracy was low." Villard 1943, 203.</page><page sequence="11">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 43 eliminating, as far as possible, the use of Muslim and Arabic- speaking intermediaries. 8. The Muslim paramount chiefs in French West Africa were stripped of the territories that they had hitherto ruled. This seems to be at variance with the "great caids Policy" practiced by Lyautey in Morocco.23 There is, in fact, an inherent contradiction between the great caids policy and the Berber policy proper. One should bear in mind, however, that the great caids were confined to the south of Morocco and that even there they were soon reduced to the person of Hajj ThamI al-GlawI. The Tazerwalt principality disappeared, and the Gundafi24 and the MtuggT died. Al-Glawl was, in fact, a solitary relic of the past, though a very important one. He was to play a major role in the drama that preceded the deposition of the sultan Muhammad V.25 Ill Ponty and ClozeFs "policy of races" bears a marked resemblance to the Berber policy of Lyautey. It took shape after the awakening of Berber consciousness in French Algeria but before the birth of the Berber policy in Morocco. These facts seem to present us with alternatives: either there was a causal nexus between the three phenomena, or else they should be considered as separate develop- ments whose similarities stemmed from similar ethnic relationships and social conditions, the identity of the political thought and colonial interests that inspired them and the fact that the adversary was in both cases the same - resurgent Islam. In actuality these are not, we believe, real alternatives, for both are true. To be sure, it was a long time before France could establish regular communications between the two shores of the great desert. This had to await the conquest of the Sahara, which was completed only after World War I. But though it was not until 1924 that the French Government decided to have the Governor General of French West Africa participate on a regular basis in the annual conference 23 The classic study of the Berbers of the southern Atlas, and of the rise of the great caids there, is Montagne 1 930. 24 A good study of this Berber chief is Justinard 1951. 25 See, for instance, Julien 1972, 324 ff. and Le Tourneau 1962, index, s.v. El-Glaoui.</page><page sequence="12">44 PESSAH SHINAR of its three North African proconsuls, there were even before then frequent contacts in both Paris and Algiers between the French officials of North Africa and those of West Africa. An effective medium for liaison and exchange of information was the Comite de l'Afrique Franchise and its monthly organ, UAfrique Frangaise (which started publication in 1890); so too was the above-mentioned Revue du Monde Musulman. Furthermore, a considerable number of colonial functionaries were posted from one African capital to another, thus enabling them to transplant their ideas and policies. A characteristic example of such a transfer is offered by Joseph Clozel. He began his colonial service in Algeria, where he first studied Arabic at Algiers University, and then joined the office of the Governor General of Algeria as secretary for the so-called communes mixtes, a form of local government that was prevalent in Berber areas such as Kabylia and the Aures, as well as in the Territories du Sud. As a result Clozel developed an interest in native society, Islam and nomadic customs. Transferred in 1896 to West Africa, he began his service in the Ivory Coast and finished it in 1918 as Governor General of French West Africa. Throughout this period - writes Delafosse - he maintained close and friendly relations with the North African authorities in general and those of Morocco in particular. In 1917 (on his return from his last visit to Paris) Clozel met with Lyautey in Rabat. Here the two men agreed on joint action in the Western Sahara with a view to restoring the commercial and cultural ties that had once connected Senegal and Mauritania with the Sus Valley and Marrakech. After ClozePs death, Lyautey, in his eulogy, extolled Clozel's contribution to an "understanding of the great movements in the southern world" and to strengthening the ties that bound together the future of French possessions in North and in West Africa.26 Clozel, who was the first to practice a pro-fetishist policy in the Ivory Coast and the Sudan, did not, however, as far as is known, participate in the shaping of the Berber policy in Morocco. But the case of General Henrys, who played an important role in the French conquest of Morocco, is different. While commanding the area of Timbuktu, he found that the effectiveness of his political action among the local Berbers (Twareg Aulimminden who lived mostly inside the Great Bend of the Niger) was greatly enhanced as soon 26 Delafosse 1918.</page><page sequence="13">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 45 as he was able to dispense with the services of Arab intermediaries and had the Berbers addressed in their own language. From this experience he drew a lesson, and when, in May 1914, he was confronted with the Beni Mtir, a fiercely independent and warlike Berber tribe of the Middle Atlas, he insisted that the French refrain from using Arabic and that they not impose the patine makhzen on tribes that had always lived in dissidence (siba). He was convinced that the Berbers would cease to resist the French once they had been assured that surrender would not curtail their right to live in accordance with their own customary laws without interference of the shaft' a and the Makhzen. This assurance was given in the dahir of 1 1 September 1914 - the first and most important of the legislative acts that served as the basis for the development of the Berber policy. Henrys' role in applying his West African experience to the Berbers of Morocco was spectacular and successful, but short-lived. Marty's action, by contrast, was of longer duration and wider effect, but of unhappy outcome for the French. The first evidence of Marty's thinking on our subject is contained in his detailed and factual report on the medersa of St.-Louis in Senegal, an institution founded in 1907. The report was concluded on 20 Nov. 1913, and in it he takes position on four aspects of native educational policy: 1 . He welcomes the teaching of West African vernaculars;27 2. He advocates a ban on Qur'anic schools in fetishist areas. Among the reasons he gives are that the marabouts openly show their contempt for the pagans, exploit them by selling them amulets, engage in religious propaganda and - according to native com- plaints - kidnap their children. Marty adds - and this is evidently his main reason - that he makes this proposal with a view to "reserving intact the fetishist societies for the sole penetration of French civilization."28 3. He accepts that Qur'anic schools have their proper place in Islamized areas, where they should be respected and not tampered with. True, he says, they have serious shortcomings and gradually replace the local civilization by a stagnant and archaic one. Yet they constitute no political danger in Senegal and should therefore 27 Marty 1913, 5. 28 Marty 1913, 80.</page><page sequence="14">46 PESSAH SHINAR be left as they are,29 the more so as any attempt to reform them is certain to create malaise. Instead, Marty recommends a policy of rapprochement and attraction to be initiated by the French schools operating in their midst.30 4. He advocates the use of the Latin alphabet instead of the Arabic script for written correspondence in the native tongues. Such use, he remarks, is already quite common (as he ascertained in his capacity as supervisor of military and administrative cor- respondence in Dakar), but should be extended throughout the Federation, thus eliminating the need for the Arabic-speaking tdlib.31 The second piece of evidence for Marty's thinking on native policy is his article about William Ponty, Governor General of French West Africa from 1908 to 1915. In it Marty reveals himself as a great admirer and devoted follower of Ponty's doctrine and policy. He quotes and analyzes two of Ponty's official circulars. In one of them, dated 22 September 1912, the Governor General set forth the principles of his native policy as it affected administration, while in the other, dated 16 August 1912, the Governor did the same with respect to justice. In the letter of 22 September 1912 Ponty points out the serious drawbacks of maintaining the territorial chiefs. They are mainly Muslims, he writes, and they tend to create oligarchies subservient to themselves. These oligarchies (Ponty continues) oppress and exploit their subjects and erect a screen between the latter and the French administrator. In such cases, the Muslims are quick to gain ascendancy over the fetishists. The situation is even worse in areas where the Muslim paramount chief has under his control a mixed Muslim- fetishist population. If such a population is led by an ambitious and fanatical chief, it begins to protest against all European innovations. The Governor General therefore held that the territorial chiefs should be maintained only where they were supported by tradition and where the princely families had given sufficient proof of their loyalty to France. In all other cases, the great chieftaincies should be broken up and their authority divided among the chiefs of cantons and heads of villages. These should be chosen from among the 29 Marty 1913, 85. 30 Marty 1913, 82. 31 Marty 1913, 83-5.</page><page sequence="15">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 47 ethnic groups themselves and be subject to the control only of the French administrator. Ponty emphasized that such an administrator must maintain direct and constant contact with the masses. Marty is at pains to show that while Ponty's attitude was one of sympathy and benevolence towards his Muslim subjects, his main concern was nevertheless to protect the fetishists from Islamic proselytism by foreign marabouts. The marabouts, in Ponty's view, formed a facade behind which sheltered the selfish hopes of the formerly privileged groups, "the last obstacle to the victory of our civilizing mission." In order to protect the fetishists, Ponty set up in Dakar a center of information relating to Islamic proselytism. This center, which became an invaluable source of data on the Islamized societies of West Africa, contained a "listing of all persons of any political or religious significance from the Atlantic to the Tchad." Ponty also issued a directive that included a detailed program for a thorough investigation of African Islam. There can be little doubt that Marty was personally involved in (and perhaps in charge of) both projects, since without them he could hardly have produced his monumental works on West African Islam. Ponty's other circular (the one dated 16 August 1912) reorganized the judicial system of the ethnic groups that still adhered to their customary law. This was done in the light of the experience accumulated since the enactment of the first ordinance on this subject, which was dated 10 January 1903. The new system was designed to ensure that each group would be under the jurisdiction of magistrates chosen from that same group. These magistrates were to apply the customary law of the parties to whatever disputes came before them. The French authorities were to intervene only in cases falling within the purview of the criminal law, and in cases where such intervention was necessary in order to put an end to barbaric practices such as cannibalism, enforced suicide and ritual homicide. The decisions of these customary law courts were subject to confirmation by a special chamber of the Court of Dakar, which became a sort of supreme court of the customary judicial system. Marty considered the creation of this special chamber to be Ponty's "crowning achievement" and "one of the most admirable monuments of the French imprint (empreinte) on Black Africa."32 32 Marty 1913, 20.</page><page sequence="16">48 PESSAH SHINAR IV The third and last of Marty's publications that will concern us here is his book Le Maroc de demain, published by the Comite de PAfrique Franchise in 1925. As indicated above, it is for us by far the most important of the three, as it deals with Marty's Moroccan experience. In particular, Marty discusses the Berber policy of the Protectorate and writes about the educated younger generation of Morocco, chiefly those he found in Fes. His account of the Berber policy represents the Moroccan counterpart of the two preceding texts. All three deal with the new native policy in the fields of education, administration and justice, and the underlying conceptions that these publications express of the relationships between Arabs, Berbers, and Islam run closely parallel. The book, however, reveals Marty's thinking in a more detailed and explicit way than do the other two texts, and it is distinguished by its frankness, not to say outspokenness. In the present context its most important feature is that it refers four times to Marty's own West African experience as a model for the Berber policy in Morocco.33 Like all partisans of the Berber Policy, Marty draws a sharp distinction between the scripturalist Islam of the Arabized cities, on the one hand, and the Islam of the Berber tribes, on the other. The city people are in his view true Muslims whose religious beliefs and practices should be treated with respect and sympathy. Moreover, he points out, if the superiority of a civilization be measured by the pre-eminence it gives to good sentiments over bad ones, then the civilization of Islam can measure up to the most exacting moral standards.34 In fact, Islam as interpreted by certain mystics such as al-Hallaj (studied by Massignon) comes near to, and even merges with, Christian morality.35 A person, especially a young one, cannot cultivate two civilizations at the same time, and if people try to change from one civilization to another, then the result will be immorality and disintegration of the social fabric.36 If, says Marty, the reader will concede these points, then it becomes obvious that a Muslim should stick to his religion and cultural heritage.

Quite apart from his objections to polygamy, and his reservations about the status of women in Islam, he has his doubts about the spiritual value of Muslim morality and wonders whether a Muslim is really capable of assimilating Western culture.38 In his eyes, a deficiency of Arab-Islamic morality lies in the fact that it had hardly ever known the Latin glories.39 The Arabs tasted of the Greek genius only in its degraded Byzantine form, and they completed their education with the individualist fantasies of the Greek sophistry. Byzantium was too oriental to be capable of supplying the Arabs with the qualities that they lack: solidity, universality and "positivity." Other qualities in which, according to Marty, the Arabs are lacking include precision, clarity of thought, a sense of order, and per- severance. Marty refers several times to these alleged defects when speaking of school children who "had the misfortune of having been born Arabs."40 The Berbers were conquered by the Orient, and, as a result, Arab culture and the Islamic religion were forced upon them. Depending on the vigor of their resistance and on their geographic location, they either rejected these elements or more or less accepted them. In any event, this fusion of Arab culture with a Berber population did not blossom into a great and noble civilization.41 French culture, by contrast, thanks to its Latin spirit and heritage, leaves an indelible mark on the young Berber (or Arab) graduate of French schools and evokes a fruitful reaction (germination). Thus the young Berber occupies an intermediate position between the oriental and Latin spirits. It is through France, daughter of Latinity, and by daily contact with us, the neo-Latins of Africa, that the Berbers will find their equilibrium and discard the oriental 37 Marty 1925, 177. 38 Marty 1925, 178-9. 39 "le genie latin."

It combined the glorification of North Africa's Roman and early Christian past with a negative view of the Arab-Islamic period. The founder of the Latin School was the writer Louis Bertrand (1866-1941), a member of the French Academy. R. Randau, A. Leblond and - in a different way - E. F. Gautier were among the most outstanding exponents of the Latin School, whose ideas were presented to the world in the journal UAfrique Latine (founded in 1921). Bertrand expressed his Roman and neo-Latin creed in such books as Lejardin de la mort (1905), Le livre de la Mediterranee (1911) and Les vilks d'or (192 1).44 His return to the Catholic Church produced his book St. Augustine (1913), while his adverse reaction to the Islamic East led him to write Le mirage oriental (1910) and Devant VIslam (1926).45 The following words, taken from the preface to Bertrand's book on Augustine, could just as well have been written by Marty himself. By virtue of his loyalty to the Empire St. Augustine appears to be one of us ... he expanded our Latin souls since he reconciled us with the Berbers... through him the unification of the Semitic and the Western geniuses was completed ... for a hundred years we have 42 Marty 1925, 210-11. 43 Marty 1925, 255. 44 Bertrand's African novels form the subject of Cabeen 1922. 45 The most effective reaction to Bertrand's theses is to be found in the writings of the Orthodox Reform (isldh, salafiyya) movement in Algeria. See especially the works of Mubarak al-MllI and Tawfiq al-Madanl, who rewrote Algerian history in a spirit diametrically opposed to that of Bertrand and his Latin School.</page><page sequence="19">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 51 carried on a similar struggle for Roman unity in his homeland ... I see in him the ideal Latin type in Africa. Bertrand's disciple, A. Sender, editor of La Depeche de Constantine, published a book in which he warned of the danger presented by Islam (Le danger de I'avenir, 1913), and Sender's ideas were echoed by his Tunisian confrere Henri Tridon in his book, Comment la France perdra ses colonies (1913). The unbridgeable gulf and perennial confrontation between a positivist, constructive Latin West and a negative and destructive Islamic East is stressed in Gautier's widely influential Le passe de VAfrique du Nord: Les siecles obscurs du Maghreb (1927). The cult of Rome was further enhanced by the publication of St. GselPs monumental Histoire ancienne de VAfrique du Nord in eight volumes (1913-28). Equipped with such principles and such stereotypes, which were further confirmed by his West African experience, Marty could not but see in Berber particularism a potential ally, whereas in the Arab ruling institution, which was based on Islamic orthodoxy, and in the Sufi orders, he saw factors to be respected, suspected and contained. He does not mince words. It is our good fortune that this people [the Berbers] is not enslaved to (asservis a) Islam ... All they have of it is a superficial varnish, often a mere label, or more precisely, a will to believe rather than belief, and this feeble faith is solely religious, leaving intact all other do- mains ... Their xenophobia is implacable, but it is not a religious xenophobia ... They know nothing of their religion ... the moral and ritual obligations of Islam ... are for the most part completely neglected, and sometimes even unknown. Their souls are filled with a host of anthropomorphic beliefs, naturistic practices and medico- magical rites. Apart from making the profession of faith, they have never been Muslims ... Yet, since they call themselves Muslims and believe themselves to be so, one should not argue with them; one must take them as they are, but without being fooled by words (sans etre dupes des mots).46 Marty fully endorses a formula devised by a top military administrator, an expert on the Berbers, whom he quotes as follow: "Our position in Morocco, in order to become permanent, must lean upon the Berber bloc, as transformed by French methods and nurtured on French ideas." Marty adds, "On ne saurait mieux dire"*1 46 Marty 1925, 216-18. 47 Marty 1925, 224.</page><page sequence="20">52 PESSAH SHINAR V In Morocco, Marty was Director of the Franco-Muslim secondary school, the College Moulay Idris, founded by Lyautey in 1914, and located in Fes, the foremost city of Moroccan Islam. Here Marty had ample opportunity to apply the principles and ideas outlined above. The line followed by the college resembled that of the medersa of St.-Louis: a purely Islamic syllabus, comprising Arabic language and literature, Islamic morality and shanea-\aw, was complemented by a syllabus of French instruction that included not only the French language, but also history, geography, mathematics, applied sciences and commerce. Not so with regard to the seven Franco-Berber schools which were set up in 1923. These provided a purely Berber environment for the education of sons of Berber notables and tribal chiefs. At the top of the Berber educational pyramid was a teachers' training school at Azru in the Middle Atlas. We can discern three figures in the establishment of these schools: Marty, his friend Louis Massignon, who advised on the choice of sites, and Georges Hardy, the Director of Education, who, like Marty, had been transferred in 1920 from French West Africa to Morocco. Within six months of their foundation, the total enrollment of these schools approached two hundred. The Franco-Berber school is a French school as regards what is taught and its way of life, and a Berber school as regards its enrolment and milieu: French with respect to the teacher, Berber with respect to the pupils. Thus there is no room here for a foreign go-between. All teaching of Arabic, all interference by the faqih, all Islamic manifestations will be strictly excluded ... We shall remove any stage of Islam, i.e. crystallization. On this point there is now complete unanimity of opinion, here as elsewhere. After many trying experiences, our North African Berber policy is absolutely sure of itself (absolument sure d'elle-meme).^ Our main effort, at least for this generation, will bear on the teaching of French ... Kabylia can serve as an encouraging living example. After half a century of efforts, the region ... is now practically bilingual ... Our attitude regarding the religion of the Berber pupils must be a neutral and benevolent silence. In a school that does not have a confessional coloring, that is clearly secular, Islam will not be spoken of ... The child must be left completely free to perform his religious duties, but they must be performed outside the time spent in class ... 48 Marty 1925, 241.</page><page sequence="21">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 53 The use of Arabic must be strictly forbidden in classes conducted in the Berber language, even when it might at first sight appear to be useful as an intermediate language.49 Again, Marty does not shrink from spelling out the political motivation of the enterprise: These Berber schools will be institutions of French policy and propa- ganda tools just as much as educational facilities. They will be part of our effort of peaceful penetration and moral conquest. The teacher will therefore be asked to regard himself as an agent and collabora- tor of the commanding officer of the area.50 Another domain in which Marty seems to have had a say was the administrative practice of the Berber jama' as. Marty quotes in extenso (though without indication of date) a circular signed by Lyautey. The circular censures a directive issued by a French intelligence officer to some Berber tribal chiefs. The officer had ordered each of these chiefs to provide himself with a tdlib whose function would be to translate and write down in Arabic the chiefs letters to the officer's bureau. The same tdlib was also to have the tasks of acting as teacher to the Berber children and of saying prayers, which (wrote the officer) many of the nomads neglect because of their ignorance. This is an absurdity (un contresens) in Berber policy ... It is not our task to teach Arabic to people who have always done without it. Arabic is a factor of Islamization ... our interest requires us to let the Berber develop outside the framework of Islam.51 Though signed by Lyautey, the spirit and wording of the circular suggest that Marty himself was its author, as suspected by Ageron.52 The third and most important field in which Marty was actively engaged was the organization of Berber justice. In particular, he was involved in the establishment of the customary law courts, the judicial jamd( as (djamaasjudiciaires), in tribal areas classified as observing Berber customary law. Ageron regards him as their creator. In fact, 49 Marty 1925, 251-2. 50 Marty 1925, 252. 51 Marty 1925, 228. The circular must have been sent out between 1919 and 1923. The former date can be inferred from the fact that the circular mentions a document dated 20 February 1919; the latter date from the fact that it mentions the founding of Berber schools as a desideratum. 52 Ageron 1971, 65 n.l.</page><page sequence="22">54 PESSAH SHINAR Marty was put in charge, in 1922, of a newly created department at the Direction des Affaires Indigenes for the study of Berber questions and the elaboration of a Berber Statute of Native Affairs - a post he occupied until his removal in 1931. Among the independent Berber tribes of Morocco, the jamd'as, as is well known to students of Berber society, were self-constituted and self-governing bodies that acted in accordance with the customary laws and traditions of the tribe. They concerned themselves with all matters of public interest and also exercised judicial and arbitral functions in both civil and criminal cases. The dahir of 1 1 September 1914 assured the newly subjected Berber tribes of the continued validity and applicability of their customary law. Marty wrote of this dahir that its importance cannot be exaggerated, for it is the legal charter of the Berber tribes, elevates their customary law to same status in the Empire of Morocco as that enjoyed by the religious law, and opens all the possibilities of the future.53 The dahir of 1914 did not mention the jama' as, but the residential decree54 of 22 September 1915 provided that litigants who fail to agree on an arbitrator should apply to the jamd'a of a higher subdivision of the tribe (fraction', firqd) for the designation of an arbitral judge (Juge arbitre). The dahir of 15 June 1922 conferred on the jamd'a a further function relating to real estate transactions, which assumed increasing importance with the development of European colonization in the conquered tribal areas. To be valid, such transactions would henceforth require the presence of the French administrator, the proprietors and the jama' a, to the exclusion of the qddi. Criminal cases were to be tried, as before, by the Sharf a Supreme Court, but now according to Berber custom.55 The establishment of special judicial jama' as encountered various difficulties. Marty stressed the difficulty of finding secretaries other than Arabic-writing tdlibs. What were needed were men who could record the deliberations and decisions of the judicial jama' a in both French and Berber. In a number of cases it was French-educated Kabyles who filled these posts.56 One should bear in mind that in 53 Marty 1925, 221. 54 A decree, that is, issued by the Resident General of Morocco. 55 Martv 1925. 230-4. 56 Marty 1925, 231-2.</page><page sequence="23">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 55 Kabylia itself the French, from 1906 onwards, forced the qddi- notaries to write their records in French; this innovation became an established fact by 191 1.57 For the transcription of Berber Marty suggested the use of the Latin alphabet, as he had done before in French West Africa with regard to the West African vernaculars.58 Another problem was posed by the existence of areas where Berber custom and shaft a law overlapped. For example, in a given tribe marriage might be in accordance with Islamic law, while succession was regulated by Berber custom. Marty had a clear-cut solution to such problems. With the passage of centuries, and as a result of the contact between the two civilizations, Arab and Berber, there has come to exist a state of equilibrium that we must respect. Consequently, in every case where a tribe, even a markedly Arabized and Islamized one, has preserved the traditional use of its language and a number of its customs and judicial and social institutions, it must fall within the category of the tribes that follow Berber custom. To impose on such a tribe the regime of the qddis will create immediate conflict between Islamic law ... and customary law ... In contrast, if such a tribe is classified among the tribes that follow Berber custom, then it will be administered and judged by Xhzjamcta. This body, and its delegates, the arbitrators, will apply the custom just as it is at a given moment, a custom that is living and changing. It will be what might be called 'the Islamized custom' [la coutume islamisee). In Senegal and Sudan it was found necessary to abolish various mahkamas of black qddis which did not meet local needs, and to replace them by native courts applying not a medieval Muslim law made for oriental people, but 'the Islamized custom' - a living custom, accepted and approved by all, and, moreover, capable of being improved and perfected. There is no other possible solution for Berber Morocco.59 The system of customary law was, however, vitiated from the start by a fundamental weakness: it lacked a secure legal basis. This was because of the persistent refusal of Sultan Mulay Yusuf to issue a dahir that would endow it with one. The dahir of 1 1 September 1914 had merely stated in general terms that the tribes that followed Berber custom would continue to be administered according to that custom. It had not established a system of customary law courts integrated into the judicial system as a whole. As a result the 57 Ageron 1971, 68 n. 1. 58 Marty 1925, 237-9. 59 Marty 1925, 236-7 (italics added).</page><page sequence="24">56 PESSAH SHINAR courts that applied customary law remained mere administrative devices, operating by virtue only of residential decrees and circular letters.60 In a number of cases the sharfa courts refused to recognize the decisions of courts of customary law, and the Arabized enclaves within the areas of Berber customary law refused to abide by them. It was increasingly felt that unless the Sultan could be induced to change his mind, the Berber policy might come to naught. The sudden demise of the Sultan in November 1927, and the accession of his son, Muhammad, a shy, inexperienced and apparently pliable youth, enabled the Berberists to attain their goal. On 7 December 1929 a commission was set up under the chairmanship of the President of the Appellate Court at Rabat. The members of the commission were mainly jurists, and its task was to examine and finalize the draft of a dahir that had been prepared by Marty's bureau. From the start the jurists on the commission were inclined to impose on the Berbers a system of French justices of the peace with Berber assessors, as had been done in Kabylia. Emphatic support for the same policy came from Georges Surdon, a noted expert on Berber institutions, though not a member of the commission. Surdon did not believe that the Berbers and the Gauls were racially related, nor did he believe that the Berbers were less attached to Islam than the Arabs. He also rejected the idea that that France should attempt to gallicize the Berbers and divide Morocco. But he insisted that it was necessary to develop Berber law along the same lines as French law, with a view to eventually assimilating Berber law to French law. He held that the time had come resolutely to carry out an active Berber policy.61 An even stronger note of urgency was sounded in A.-J. Ribaut's doctoral dissertation on the Berber judicial jama' as.62 This work was presented to the Faculty of Law at the University of Algiers. In it Ribaut insisted that a dahir legalizing the judicial jama' as be issued without delay, as it would stop further infiltration of the shaft' a. Procrastination, he argued, was bound to have disastrous con- 60 Lists of the relevant official documents will be found in Marty 1925, 220-2 and Surdon 1938, 113-17. 61 Surdon 1930, 378-80. 62 Ribaut 1930, which includes lists of the fifty officially designated Berber custom tribes (271-3), of the seventy- two judicial jama' as that existed in 1929 (274-9), and of the fourteen Berber custom tribes not yet provided with judicial jama' as (280).</page><page sequence="25">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 57 sequences. Citing Louis Milliot, he declared that the Sultan was obligated by the Treaty of Fes to accept reforms proposed by France, and that any refusal on his part entitled France to act unilaterally.63 Instead of combating Islam, France had foolishly restored it by extending the temporal power of the Sultan. Yet the game had ended in a draw: while Islam remained stationary, Arabic had been gaining ground.64 Although Ribaut, like Surdon, was not a member of the commission, he was in all likelihood not a complete outsider either. This is suggested by the fact that part III of his dissertation comprises a proposal for an official organization of the judicial jamSas that agrees in all essentials with the proposal submitted by Marty's bureau. If we bear in mind that the thesis was completed in October 1929, that is, two months before the commission was appointed, and that it was approved by the jury on 8 May 1930, that is, a week before the promulgation of the Berber dahir, then the conclusion is in- escapable that Ribaut had previous knowledge of Marty's draft. In fact he probably had a hand in its formulation. Marty's draft provided not only for the legalization of the judicial jama' as as Berber customary law courts, but also for the establishment of Berber customary courts of appeal. These were to be presided over by French judges, and they were also to act as courts of first instance for the more serious criminal offenses. The power to regulate the organization and composition of the Berber customary law courts was permanently delegated to the Grand Vizier. The juris- diction of the French courts in Morocco was to be extended to cover all cases involving real estate to which a French citizen was a party. On one point only did the commission go beyond Marty's proposal: it refused to leave serious criminal cases in the hands of the Berber courts and insisted on having them tried by French courts; this despite the warnings of Gen. Nogues, the Director General of Native Affairs, and especially of his deputy, Col. Benazet, who feared Muslim reaction. The final version, which was signed by the new Sultan, became known as the Berber dahir. Benazet's apprehensions turned out to be more than justified. The dahir not only proved to be a powerful catalyst of Moroccan 63 Ribaut 1930, 248. b4 Ribaut 1930, 268.</page><page sequence="26">58 PESSAH SHINAR national sentiment, but also aroused Muslim world opinion against France as never before. Some high officials were made to pay for the blunder, first and foremost Marty. He was compelled to resign and to leave Morocco in a hurry. Was he the real culprit or merely a scapegoat? Obviously, overall responsibility for the Berber policy lay not with him, but with his superiors, the Residents General Lyautey, Steeg, and Saint. Responsibility also lay with the Directors General of the Department of Sharf a Affairs and the Department for Native Affairs, and with the commission that drafted the dahir. A very important contributing factor to the publication of the dahir was the atmosphere created in French circles by the 'Berber myth' and by the propaganda of the Catholic Church.65 All this, however, does not detract from Marty's crucial role in this affair.66 This role he was able to play thanks to his vast knowledge of Islam in West Africa and his absolute conviction that the "policy 65 A most significant feature of North African colonial history was the re- establishment of the Catholic Church in the region, following the French conquest of Algiers in 1830. Cardinal Lavigerie (1825-92), Archbishop of Algiers and Carthage and Primate of Africa, played a dominating role in the North African church. He was the driving force behind its activities, and founder of the societies of the White Fathers and White Sisters. His conversion to Catholicism of orphans in Kabylia aroused the opposition of the military authorities, fearful of its effect on the stability and peace of the region under their control. Lavigerie pushed the French to establish their protectorate in Tunisia, and the Eucharistic Congress of Carthage of 1930, which was so deeply resented by the Muslims, may be viewed as the product of his ideas. In Morocco, missionary activities centered on the Franciscan Vicariate of Rabat, founded in 1907. Its head was Mgr. Henri Veille. Veille was engaged in missionary activities among the Moroccan Berbers - a major item in the list of French misdeeds - and he seems to have had liaisons with Marty's bureau, where (according to a Moroccan source) copies of an Arabic life of Jesus were offered for sale (Ageron 1971, 78). For a factual and candid account of the New Church of Africa, see Pons 1930, in which pp. 284-303 deal with the activities of the church in Morocco. It was common knowledge that the Catholic mission was more than eager to help the Berber policy in its ultimate aims. Cf. al-Nasirl 1931. 66 There were those (e.g., Tahar Essafi, a noted member of the Old Destour Party of Tunisia) who believed that Marty was merely a scapegoat who was made to pay for the blunders of his superiors (J. L. L. 1938, quoting from an article by Essafi that appeared on 21 April 1938 in UEcho de Tanger). This belief does not, however, seem to be well-founded. cAllal al-FasT, the foremost leader of Moroccan nationalism, calls Marty "one of the greatest propagandists (min akbar du'dt)" of the Berber policy. He singles out for special condemnation a passage in Marty's book Le Maroc de demain that deals with educational policy for the Berbers (al-FasI 1948, 162).</page><page sequence="27">A MAJOR LINK BETWEEN FRANCE'S BERBER POLICY 59 of races" and the Berber policy were not only in the best interests of France but also an act of justice towards the West African fetishists and the Moroccan Berbers. He believed that such policies had been an unqualified success both in Algeria and in West Africa. This conviction led him to disregard the fundamental difference between the state of Islam at different times and in different places. In particular he overlooked the following points: 1. That Islam in West Africa was acephalous, while Morocco's Islam had a sovereign who was also the Imam and a Sharif, whose spiritual authority was recognized even by those tribes that rejected him as a temporal ruler, and whose supreme duty it was to protect and defend Islam and the shan'a. 2. That French West Africa was a colony, while Morocco was internationally recognized as a protectorate with a native sovereign. 3. That while Islam was a minority religion in French West Africa, it was as deeply and widely entrenched in Morocco as in any other Muslim country. Fes, the capital of Morocco, was from the beginning one of the major metropolises of Islam. 4. That the distinction made by the Berberists between a true Muslim and a superficially Islamized one was utterly foreign to the consciousness of the Berbers themselves and to the SunnI sharfa. The distinction was totally inadmissible to any religious authority in Islam. In the eyes of the sharfa, a bad or ignorant Muslim is still a Muslim. 5. That West African Islam was peripheral, remote and isolated by the Sahara from the heartland of the Islamic world,67 whereas Morocco was part and parcel of the Maghrib and in continuous touch with the Mashriq. 6. That the mood of the younger generation and the political climate in the Islamic world had undergone a profound change from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards. Among the milestones in this process of change may be mentioned: the rise of Wahhabism, and of the orthodox Islamic reform movements known by the names of salafiyya and isldh; 'Abdelkrlm and the Rlf War; the rise of the Tunisian Destour Party and of the Algerian North African Star party; Ibn Badls's isldh movement, also in Algeria; ferment in the Middle East, in particular Arabism 67 Though it should be noted that the pilgrimage to Mecca brought the West Africans into contact with the Mashriq.</page><page sequence="28">60 PESSAH SHINAR versus Zionism; and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, followed by the Kemalist revolution and emergence of new Arab states. Among the irritants accelerating this process were the Eucharistic Congress of Carthage and the deeply resented centenary celebra- tions of the French conquest of Algiers, both of which took place in 1930. It is highly unlikely that a man like Marty would have misread or ignored these danger signals, had not the initial success of his policy in West Africa, coupled with the apparent docility of the rising generation in Morocco (the 'Young Moroccans') lulled him into a false confidence. This leads us to the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that it was precisely the complete success - as it appeared at the time - of Ponty and Clozel's policy of races that must be held partly responsible for the failure of the Berber Policy in Morocco.
