ISSN 001 1-3204 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY, a world journal devoted to the sciences of man, is sponsored by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. It is the pub- lished record of an experiment in communication within a worldwide community of individual scholars, the Asso- ciates in CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY. Associates are persons judged by their colleagues to be professionally competent in the relevant disciplines, through application, nomination, and, where the Editor requires advice, election. Associates participate in the formation of CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY policy and are regarded as the core element in the refereeing and commentary system. Articles are intended to be of the highest scholarly calibre consistent with the broad goals of the journal. The "sciences of man" are defined in the broadest possible way, embracing many subdisciplines and variations in approaches to an- thropology. CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY does not intend to compete for highly specialized articles which are more appropriately placed in other journals. Articles published in CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY should, ideally, communicate across the subdisciplines, whether these are thought of in terms of subjects, regional emphases, national traditions, or re- search orientations. This may be achieved through, for example, the choice of a synthesizing topic, or by using language which can interest those who are not familiar with a specialty. The articles should also be current, that is, reveal a control of contemporary thinking, and they should be forward-looking-even, on occasion, specula- tive-in the thrust of their ideas. The world aspect of CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY indicates contributions to internation- al knowledge. Thus articles which express regionally located ideas or information are valued if they are written to place those ideas more firmly on the world scene. Articles submitted are sent to 20 referees, chosen interna- tionally, who advise the Editor as to suitability for publica- tion and who may make suggestions for the author. Authors are encouraged to submit names and addresses of scholars whom the Editor may consider in drawing up the list of referees. After acceptance, most articles and some other materials are given CA* treatment. Such materials are sent to 50 commentators selected internationally and for their potential contribution to scholarly debate. Articles are sent to the commentators in copy-edited manuscript form or in galleys, depending upon printing deadlines. The author responds to those comments which are received by a stipulated date. In view of mail uncertainties, the Editor cannot be sure that commentators will always be in a position to reply by that date; hence late responses, and other comments by Associates and subscribers, may be published in later issues in the department entitled Discussion and Criticism. From time to time the Editor raises matters he feels to be of interest to Associates, especially concerning the policy of the journal. The Reply Letter provides a medium of response; selected excerpts from these and other letters to the Editor are published. An important function of CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY iS to provide a place for the publication of international and interdisciplinary professional news and items of scholarly interest which are urgent. The normal procedures and deadlines of a scholarly periodical often result in delays which reduce currentness and also reduce the impact of give-and-take correspondence. The Newsletter insertion operates with shorter deadlines and less formality. Authors submitting material suitable for the Newsletter are request- ed to accept the principle that the copy-editor may make changes in the text without further reference to the author, should publication deadlines and clarity of communication require this. Departments will change from time to time depending upon the nature of submissions. The editorial policy with regard to some departments (e.g., Publications Received), should there be any special points to bear in mind, will be printed regularly in the space allotted to the department. Copyright is vested in the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. Details concerning copyright and permissions for major contributions are embodied in a document sent to each author for signature when publica- tion is approved. By decision of the Associates, English is the lingua franca of CURRENT. ANTHROPOLOGY. Experiments will, however, be undertaken to attempt to reduce some of the restrictive features of this necessary decision. It should be borne in mind that changes in language policy may have considerable repercussions on the refereeing system and CA* treatment. Subject to financial limitations and the availability of translators, the Editor is prepared to consider articles submitted in languages other than English. In such circum- stances, he is forced to seek such advice as is readily available to determine whether the expense of translation is justified prior to submission of the article to referees. Quotations should be translated into English for the English text and must be homogeneous with any non-English text published. Furthermore, the original text of the quotation should also be supplied for editorial purposes. Manuscripts should follow the format and style of material printed in CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY. A style sheet for refer- ences may be obtained from the Editor on request. The University of Chicago Press Manual of Style gives useful information on the handling of quotations, capitalization, punctuation, the arrangement of tables, etc. Manuscripts should be typed double-spaced. (When contributions come from locations where typing facilities are not available the Editor will be prepared to consider un-typed clear manu- scripts. This is a special service to colleagues operating under a disadvantage and must not be construed as a general rule.) References cited should be listed alphabetically, double-spaced, at the end of the paper. Footnotes, num- bered in sequence throughout the paper, should be gath- ered together and typed double-spaced at the end. Ac- knowledgments, if any, should constitute the first footnote (the identifying number being attached to the title of the paper). Tables should be typed on separate sheets, titled, numbered with arabic numerals, and cited in the text. Figures should also be numbered and cited in the text. Photographs should have a glossy finish and high contrast; where it is relevant, the scale should be indicated in the photograph itself or in the caption. Drawings should be in india ink on white paper; if they are not of high enough quality for printing, the author will be asked to improve them. Captions for all figures should be typed, double- spaced, on a separate sheet of paper.. Articles must be accompanied by abstracts of their sub- stance, usually up to 300 words, which will be translated into French, Spanish, and Russian without further reference to the author. (The author may provide his own transla- tions.) Experimentally, short items for publication may be accepted for printing in other languages at the request of the author, always provided they can be translated and published in English as well, either by the author or by the Editor's office. Manuscripts and all communications concerning the content of the journal should be sent to the Editor, CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada V6T 1W5.</page><page sequence="3">ktdIHROPOLOGYrx,y MARCH 1976 VOL. 17 NO. 1 4:e dI'#ElortE1~1 rn Anthropology A WORLD JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCES OF MAN CONTENTS Georges Mounin 1 Language, Communication, Chimpanzees with CA* comment James Nwannukwu Kerri 23 Studying Voluntary Associations as Adaptive Mechanisms: A Review of Anthropological Perspectives with CA* comment Erik Cohen 49 Environmental Orientations: A Multidimensional Approach to Social Ecology with CA* comment Ramkrishrza Mukherjee 71 The Value-Base of Social Anthropology: The Context of India in Particular with CA* comment J.

Leinen 96,- DM Zwei ungarische Ethnologen unternehmen es, aufgrund einer zwanzigjThrigen Forschungs- arbeit das Bild eines Dorfes ihrer Heimat zu zeichnen, der Gemeinde Atany - am Vorabend der allgemeinen Umgestaltung der ungarischen Landwirtschaft. Sie analysieren mit einer nur selten erreichten Prazision und Detailliertheit eine bauerliche Lebensform, in der trotz der Wandlungen der letzten hundert Jahre noch viele Ziuge aus dem Komplex der bauerlich-so- zialen Zusammenhange und Wertsysteme friuherer Zeiten erhalten blieben. Die Forscher ge- langen, von den Arbeiten des Alltags ausgehend, zu der Interpretation der Prinzipien, der Leitbilder und der Begriffe, die sich die Bauern vom guten menschlichen Leben, vom Ver- hangnis, vom Rahmen und von den Grenzen ihrer eigenen bauerlichen Lebensform machen. Die Arbeit stellt zugleich einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Erhellung der Struktur bauerlichen Daseins iiberhaupt dar: nicht nur die spezifische Agrarstruktur eines bestimmten Dorfes wird damit analysiert, sondern daruiber hinaus lassen sich mit Hilfe der hier erarbeiteten Kategorien Formen agrarischer Existenz uiberhaupt verstehen, weshaib dieses Werk wegen seiner hervor- ragenden Methodik alle Volkskundler, Ethnologen, Soziologen und Agrarwissenschaftler inte- ressieren duirfte.
