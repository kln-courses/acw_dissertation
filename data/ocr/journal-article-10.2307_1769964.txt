<plain_text><page sequence="1">FREDERICK M. RENER Friedrich Spee and Virgil's Fourth Georgic i' |U SE' LO mio maestro e '1 mio autore," says Dante to Virgil in the opening Canto of the Divina Commedia (v. 85). In say- ing this, Dante, besides speaking for himself, could well be speaking on behalf of Europe as a whole. For many centuries Europe went to school to Virgil; yet the extent of Virgil's impact is not fully known, particularly where German literature is concerned.2 Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld (1591-1635) lived in the early seven- teenth century, when the foundations of modern German literature were being laid by the so-called Silesian School. Spee, a Jesuit and a Rhinelander, was not a member of the group. His position as an outsider was reinforced by the fact that the romantics, and many critics since, have interpreted his poetic collection, Trutznachtigall, almost as a pred- ecessor of the romantic movement. In it they found an apparent combi- nation of "Gott und Natur" expressed in a style similar to that of the folk songs and contrasting sharply with the poetry of the Silesian School, which imitated the classics of Rome and Greece. The first critic to depart from this conception was Eric Jacobsen, who attempted to place Spee in the tradition of Petrarchism.3 It is conceded that Spee was influenced by Virgil, but this influence 1 A short list: D.

Spee's long poem on the bees (XXIII), which is the object of our study, has received some attention from scholars, but their views are very divergent. Jacobsen (followed later by Miss Rosenfeld) men- tions in passing that Spee took a few passages from Virgil,4 while Ilse Martens, writing in the romantic tradition, sees this poem as one of Spee's most spontaneous creations.5 The present essay studies Spee's debt to Virgil in this poem from the point of view of the technique of imitatio. At the same time it also considers the poem in the tradition of the Georgics and that of the image of the bee, both intimately connected with our topic. Of all Virgil's works, the Georgics is that with the smallest number of imitators. This is not because it lacked an appreciative audience; on the contrary, Dryden considered it "the best poem of the best poet."6 Many scholars have judged it the most artistically perfect work of all Latin antiquity.7 Perhaps the arid subject matter failed to arouse later poets to imitate it as they imitated the Bucolics. The seventeenth century is particularly sterile in this respect. "In the 17th century the georgic almost disappears; a few angling poems, Pere Rapin's Horti, and an- other Latin poem on gardens seem the sole representatives of the type."8 Germany is said to have been rather indifferent to all of Virgil's works.9 Sister Lilly found in the entire German-speaking area only one work which goes back to the Georgics-Kirchmayer's Agricultutra sacra (Basel, 1550).10 Against this background, Spee's poem acquires new significance inasmuch as it is one of very few works inspired by the Georgics, and appears when and where one would least expect it. The poem also has some importance in the tradition of the image of the bee. This image enjoyed great popularity in the seventeenth century, but was used mostly in love poetry deriving from the Greek Anthology (Cupid and the Bee). The tradition of the Bienenstaat, which comes from Virgil, was normally confined to emblems and works 4 Jacobsen, p. 137, note 2; Emily Rosenfeld, Neue Studien zur Lyrik von Fried- rich von Spee (Milan, 1963), p. 131. 5 In her article "Darstellung der Natur in den Dichtungen Friedrichs von Spee" she states: "Es ist fast, als habe Spee seinen hymnischen Zweck... ganz vergessen ...

As for poetic treatment of it, Spee's poem stands alone except for a section of Czepko's Coridon und Phyllis. In the margin of the Strassburg manuscript of Trutznachtigall,l Spee put a note saying: "Vide Authores, S. Ambros; Aristot: 1; 8.9.1. Virg: 1:4 Geor. Auicon: 1:8. cap.2. Plin: 1:11 c. 6. Barthol: de pro- priet: lib. 12. c. 4&amp;1: 18. c: 11." These names do not represent his sources but rather the authorities testifying to the validity of the in- formation given. The poet wishes to assure the reader that he is not inventing stories but writing about proven facts. This is the only poem in Trutxnachtigall where such scientific material is used and conse- quently the only one with a list of auctores. Spee lists a philosopher (Aristotle), a scientist (Pliny), a physician (Avicenna), a theologian (St. Ambrose), and a more recent writer of an encylopedia (Bartholo- maeus Anglicus). Spee's real source is Virgil, as we shall show, al- though a few details come from elsewhere, probably Pliny. The poet probably knew Pliny only through Bartholomaeus' encyclopedia De proprietatibus rerum. Spee belongs to the tradition of the poeta doctus, which goes back to the Augustan age. According to this tradition, the poet is not a creator of new things, but an imitator and an emulator of the old. This con- ception of the poet had been expressed in the past by the image of the bee, too. The bee gathers nectar from various flowers and changes it into honey, which is something new. In this connection Petrarch says, "Nulla quidem esset apibus gloria, nisi in aliud et melius inventa converte- rent."'2 Likewise the poet gathers his material from the best works of others (often described as flowers, as in florilegium) and is, therefore, an "inventor" in the etymological meaning of the word. His real glory consists (as in the case of the bee) in melting these miscellaneous items and casting something entirely new and better ("aliud et melius"). In Germany it was Herder who finally broke with this long tradition and introduced originality as the criterion for poetry. In Dichtung und Wahrheit Goethe tells of his disappointment when Herder dismissed Ovid, Goethe's idol, with the argument, "alles sei Nachahmung des schon dagewesenen" (P. II, b. 10). This conception was partly respon- sible for the German lack of interest in Virgil, who was considered an imitator of Homer. Spee, on the other hand, owes to this very idea his popularity with the romantics. They saw in him an original poet among a crowd of imitators. 11 Ed. G. O. Arlt (Halle, 1936), p. xciv.

Gmelin, "Das Prinzip der Imitatio in den romanischen Literaturen der Renaissance," Romanische Forschungen, XLVI (1932), 85. 120</page><page sequence="4">SPEE AND VIRGIL The principal tool of this kind of poet was the technique called imitatio. While we have several studies in which this technique is de- scribed theoretically, we do not know of any which show how the theory was put into practice. We shall consider Spee's work from this point of view and examine (1) the structure, (2) the subject matter, and (3) the style of the poem in terms of imitatio. Biichner says that the fourth Georgic was rather late in receiving proper critical evaluation. One difficulty concerned the didactic nature of the poem, a second its structure.13 Helmut Dahlmann proved that this poem was not essentially didactic at all, but rather an allegory in which the bees were presented as a quasi-human society, only more perfect, to serve as a model to the decaying Roman society of the times. Virgil uses anthropomorphic imagery and vocabulary, and the topoi employed by Greek ethnologists when describing a new nation they visited.14 As for its structure, the poem presents the tripartite pattern common in classical antiquity. An introduction (with two addresses) is followed by the core of the poem or narratio, to which a short sphragis (a self- identification of the poet) is attached. The narratio is in turn subdivided into two sections, one dealing with the life of the bees and the second with Aristaeus, the mythical first apiculturist. Perret points out the numerical symmetry of the parts. The introduction has seven lines, the conclusion eight and the caesura between the two parts of the narratio falls almost in its mathematical center, the first half having 273 and the second 278 lines.15 The Aristaeus episode is epic in nature, a rectilinear narrative without structural problems. The difficulties to which Biichner referred concerned the first part of the narratio. It appears so disorderly in its continuous shifts from didactic parts to digressions (Exkurse) as to defy any attempt to find a logical pattern in its arrangement. The explanation suggested by scholars is that Virgil was using the rhetorical device called variatio. In its main architectural lines Spee's poem presents the same pic- ture-a tripartite pattern for the whole poem and a binary pattern for the central section. It also has a numerical symmetry of its own which mathematically is even more precise than Virgil's.

Perret, Virgile (Paris, 1965), pp. 60 ff. 121</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE and conclusion have three stanzas each and the two sections of the narratio nineteen stanzas each. We find conformity, but also change in the structure. There is a change also within these parts, especially a stricter adherence to the precepts of rhetoric. The component parts are clearly rhetorical in nature, invocatio, narratio, and peroratio. Furthermore Spee changes the purpose of the poem. He does not wish to inform but to praise. The poem is a laudatio (the title begins with the words "Lob des Schopfers") and as such it falls into the genus demonstrativum or epideiktikon genos, which had to conform to special requirements in the rhetorical tradition.16 Curiously enough, Jacobsen and Rosenfeld regard it as a didactic poem (Lehrgedicht). Rhetoric is also partly responsible for the tendency towards order, proportion, and logical disposition which is evident in the symmetry of the larger units and in smaller details and in the layout of the material throughout the poem. Spee's narratio is a model of order and logical disposition as opposed to that of Virgil. It is subdivided into two sections according to a "visual" criterion, i.e., into a visible vita externa and a vita interna hidden even from the sun ("der himmlisch augenball") which sees everything that goes on in the world. The first section contains one day in the life of the bees, as compared to a whole year in Virgil. The part with the "invisible" activities describes their social organization, hous- ing, procreation, and swarming. The invocatio and peroratio also pre- sent some interesting structural details. They both have two addressees, God and men, yet the ratio of lines given to each is inverted in the two parts. In the former God receives twenty lines and men four; in the latter God has four and men twenty. In thus changing his poem from a Lehrgedicht to a Lobgedicht Spee wished to create an "aliud et melius" of his own while using Virgil as his model. Thus he replaced Virgil's sphragis by a peroratio and conse- quently employed a new rhetorical tone. A similar change can be noticed in the invocatio. There are other changes in the content of the two poems. First a few words about the poet's statement of intentio. The poem comes in Rosenfeld's Laudes section. It stands out not only for its size but also for the fact that it concentrates on a simple "wercklein" of God's creation, while the others have a long list of them similar to those found in the Psalms.17 The title, in its complete form, is programmatic: "Lob des Sch6pfers darin ein kleines wercklein seiner weisheit, nemblich 16 See H. Lausberg, Handbuch der literarischen Rhetorik (Munich, 1960), ? 243-248. 17 It is symptomatic that Miss Rosenfeld discusses this poem together with those of the Sponsa cycle and not with the Laudes. Neue Studien, p. 131. 122</page><page sequence="6">SPEE AND VIRGIL die wunderliebliche handtierung der Immen oder Bienen beschrieben wird." Finally, the invocatio, as in Virgil's poem, announces the gen- eral topic of the praise of God common to all the poems of this section and then comes to the specific intention of this poem: Wil zarte verBlein zwingen Von jmmen wol bekindt. (Page 127, lines 10-11) The notion that the bee occupies a privileged place in creation was common in classical times, hence Virgil's "admiranda ... spectacula ... dicam" (lines 4-5), a feeling shared by Spee, "die wunder dein betracht" (p. 127, line 1). Spee also uses Virgil's notion that the smallness of the hero whose praises are being sung, rather than diminishing the glory of the poet, actually increases it, with the difference that Virgil wants the glory for himself, ("at tenuis non gloria" 6), and Spee for God. The underlying concept in Spee is that of "deus artifex" whose wonder- ful works reflect his perfection and proclaim his glory.18 Wie wunder / und wie wunder Mull er dan selber sein I (Page 141, 5) He carries over into this poem the notion which he expressed program- matically in the poem which precedes it in the collection. DaB meisterstuck mit sorgen Wer nur wilt schawen an / Jhm freilich nit verborgen/ Der meister bleiben kan. (Page 110, 6-9) The poet's intentio to write a laudatio not only affected the tone of the poem but was his real guide when the poet was gathering and select- ing his subject matter. Unlike Virgil, who used the unusual aspects in the life of the bees as one topos among many, Spee made "wunder" the sole criterion of his choice. Man's laudatory disposition is evidently best aroused (movere) by the unexpected, by the paradoxon in its etymological sense, which is built into the "wunder." Spee is in this respect following the trend of the time. The element of surprise was an important ingredient in works of art since Aristotle, but its role in- creased during the Renaissance not only in literature but also in music, painting, staging, and architecture. As a result, Spee discards all those passages in Virgil devoted to description of the "Umwelt und Heimat" or to instructions on apiculture and, of course, the whole Aristaeus episode. 18 See E. R. Curtius, Europdische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter (Bern, 19676), p. 527. 123</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Virgil describes the life of the bees as a cycle of a year, from spring to the harvest. It is logical, therefore, that the section de vita et moribus will begin with a spring setting (here, as a variant of the winter-spring- struggle motif, "ubi pulsam hiemem Sol aureus egit sub terras"). Spee's entire narratio is actually restricted to de vita et moribus and the first part dealing with the "visual" activities of the bees, de vita externa, encompasses the shorter cycle of a complete day, with the tripartite division of departure, gathering of the nectar, and return to the hive. Strictly speaking, Spee could have chosen any day of any season of the year. Since he also describes a spring day we may suspect that the inspiration came from Virgil. Der Winter ist fiirbey: Schon gaffen jetz / und gienen/ Die bluimlein allerley. (Page 127, 17-19) Of the several flights in Virgil (the swarm, the battle flight, the idle flight, in that order), Spee took only the first two, inverting their order, the battle flight at the beginning and the swarm at the end; the former dealing with the daily activities and the second with the yearly ones. This is an interesting touch that seems to express visually the immor- tality of the bees, which Virgil stated poetically when he said, "at genus immortale manet" (208). At the same time he gives the poem a circular form-since the swarm is the beginning of a new Bienenstaat the whole poem could start from the beginning again-a kind of Ringkomposition of classical coinage. The most striking element in Spee's poem is the description of the bees in terms of an army, in the first part of the narratio. These "gelbe kriegerlein" (p. 128, 3) live in a "wachsen=burg" (p. 132, 16), they fly out armed "mit wehr und waffen" (p. 127, 22) and are even supplied with a military band of sorts "bey trommel / und trompetten" (p. 131, 5). Virgil had referred to the bees as "agmen" and used military ter- minology in the battle scene including the sound effects "sonitus imitata tubarum" (72). The adoption of this imagery provides the first and most striking paradoxon and "wunder." Taking notice of the common idea (probably originating from Pliny) that no harm is done to the plants by the bees gathering nectar, the poet exploits the antithetical possibilities of the situation. While the expedition of the "gelbe krieger- lein" has all the grim characteristics of a destructive war ("raub," "beut," pliindern") it ultimately turns out to be a "friedlichs rauben" and a "siisser blumen krieg." The space devoted to this episode is a sign of the importance the poet attaches to it. Using rhetorical amplifi- catio he spends four entire stanzas on it, enlarging the two opposing 124</page><page sequence="8">SPEE AND VIRGIL facets of the oxymoron "friedlichs rauben" to larger units of several lines pivoting on the adversativum "doch" (five times). Since Spee's stanzas have eight lines and are normally subdivided into two units of four lines, the poet arranges two oxymora per stanza, giving two lines to one side of the antithesis and two to the other, as in the following: Sie gleich dal best erheben / DaB3 beste blumen=blut Und bleiben doch beyneben Die blimlein wolgemuth. (Page 128, 16-19) The amplification is attained by rhetorically redefining the nectar (e.g., "beut," "schatz," "blut") and thus creating a new situation. The degree of originality allowed to the poet by imitatio is consider- able in the description of the opening flight. Not less interesting is the concluding flight, the swarm. There are several details which Spee takes from Virgil. First of all this flight is directed not towards the fields but towards the ethereal heights, "aethere in alto" (78), "ad sidera caeli" (58), In lifften er [i.e., der hauff] braviret / Zun wolcken schwebet auff. (Page 137, 9-10) Then come the two means to attract the swarm suggested by Virgil, a tingling sound, "tinnitusque cie" (64), and the spreading of odorif- erous herbs, "asperge sapores" (62). Spee takes over these details and also a stylistic element from Virgil: he abandons the laudatory style and becomes didactic by adopting the imperative "schlagt," "last" and even the coniunctivus iussivus "sich bereite," "sie leite." There are Virgilian echoes also in the description of the settling down of the bees if we compare Spee's Wans nur das krautlein riechen/ Sie gern sich halten lan (Page 138, 13-14) with Virgil's "ipsae consident medicatis sedibus" (65). More impres- sive, of course, is the imitation of the sound, for the onomatopoetic effect of Virgil's "tinnitus" is amplified by Spee in sound and size: Schlagt auff ting=tang: ting=tyren: Ting=tang: ting tyren=tang: (Page 137, 19-20) But the choice of the instruments alone shows how Spee has changed the whole character of this flight. Virgil had suggested ritual instru- ments ("cymbalum matris") giving this gesture a religious and mythical 125</page><page sequence="9">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE character ;1 Spee takes his instrunents from the kitchen ("pfann und becken") thus bringing the procedure to a lower and more homely sphere: Her / her nun pfann / und becken / Schlagt auff daB giitlich kling / Und last den schwarm erschrocken/ DaB nit er gar entspring. (Page 137, 15-18) In fact, the whole scene of the swarm is presented with imagery taken from a human home. Using anthropomorphic expressions the swarm becomes nothing short of an Abschiedslied: Ade du siisses helmet; Ade du mutter=schoB; Hinaussen ungezeimet Sich waget unser sto... Frisch hin und her sich schwencket Die giilden=gelbe schaar / Nach frembdem land gedencket/ Jhr hauB verlasset gar. (Page 137, 3-6, 11-14) In addition to these passages where Spee departs radically from his model, we find passages where he is less inventive and adheres more closely to the original. In the section devoted to the gathering of nectar Spee stresses the characteristic industriousness of the bees. His model had stressed this point by describing their love for flowers and their pride in making honey and the fact that they damaged their wings and even sacrificed their lives in pursuit of their duty: saepe etiam duris errando cotibus alas attrivere, ultroque animam sub fasce dedere. (Lines 203-4) Spee keeps both the damage to the wings and death, inverts the order of occurrence, but otherwise leaves only slight indications that he is following Virgil: Man wil daB etlich storben / animam dedere Von viel zu statem flug / errando Weils sich zu gar beworben / gloria mellis Wan sie nit funden gnug. In stein und felsen=rissen / duris cotibus An 6rten steinig=hart / Offt habens abgeschlissen / attrivere Wol halbe fluigel zart. alas (Page 130, 8-15) 9 See R. von Ranke-Graves, Griechische Mythologie, I (Hamburg), 25, note 2. 126</page><page sequence="10">SPEE AND VIRGIL For the return flight to the hive, Spee borrows two incidents from classical sources, one from Virgil and the other from Pliny, both intro- duced by an "offt"-in order to add another source of "wunder," namely the intelligence of these creatures. It was common belief that bees in order to fly in stormy winds picked up little stones to serve as stabilizing ballast the way dinghies would do, to use Virgil's image. Spee gives the information without essential change, and half a stanza to the fear that the wind "sie m6gt blasen weg," and the other half to the remedy. Sich drumb dan bas beladen / Mit kleinen steinelein; So schwebens ohne schaden / Weil dan sie schwarer sein. (Page 131, 11-14) Another proof of the intelligence of bees came originally from Pliny. Those bees that cannot return home before darkness and have to spend the night outdoors, in order to keep their wings dry and be able to fly early in the morning, sleep on their backs. Spee retains the information but enlarges on details, uses rhetorical devices, and expands the descrip- tion to three stanzas; the first deals with the situation, the second with the remedy ("sich legens"), and the third with the resumption of the flight at dawn. (This last gives the poet the opportunity to describe the rosy dawn he likes so much.) We have noted that Virgil wrote his poem using the rhetorical device of variatio, hence his description of the Bienenstaat is not confined to a single passage. The ancients believed that the beehive was governed by a king. Virgil's reader becomes aware of the king early in the poem, in the battle scene, and then must wait for a full treatment of this point until the section de vita et noribus (159-250). Even here, the king is not given priority of treatment. The first place is reserved to the citizens and their organization; "alone they have community of children and shelter of a confederate city and spend their life under the majesty of law": Solae communis natos, consortia tecta urbis habent, magnisque agitant sub legibus aevum. (Lines 153-4) Social divisions are based on the tasks performed; the younger bees are entrusted with the gathering of pollen, while the older ones work at home building walls, educating children, standing guard at the main gate, and watching the weather. Little is said of the authority responsible for the governing of these individuals and for the distribution of differ- ent tasks. The expression "magnisque sub legibus" suggests an innate 127</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE sense of law and order as it existed in the golden age, and the bees were supposed to have preserved it; it is toward this that Virgil would like Romans to strive. This society is composed of mature and responsible citizens ("Quirites"), capable of self-government, to which the king gives unity and coherence, "regi incolumi mens omnibus una est" (212), without punitive powers and without laws (the king was believed to be without a sting). The outstanding characteristic of the vita intcrna in Spee's poem is its orderliness, order in re and in its presentation. Basically all elements found in Virgil are used by Spee, but the changes are considerable. He begins the description of his res publica with the king who heads the state and distributes all official duties. The social structure has the form of a pyramid where the power is concentrated in the king and then cascades through the descending steps of the social scale. We should not interpret this as Spee's endorsement of an absolute mon- archy, just as we should not look in Spee for references to his own times. The bees' king is elected by the citizens. The king has one stanza to himself; one is reserved for the higher ranks: the royal body guards, the army, the sentinel, and the weathermen; one to the workers. The distribution of lines displays the same orderly picture. In the stanza on the higher ranks each is allotted a couplet beginning with "gleich"; in the next, since there are only two classes of workers, but eight lines in the stanza, Spee gives four lines to one and four to the other. Virgil's imagery depicting the specific activities of the working bees is inconsistent. In some passages he uses the simile of masons building houses ("fundamina," "tecta," "moenibus," "aulas"), in others the bees appear as smiths, in a miniature version ("si parva licet componere magnis") of the mythical smiths under Mount Aetna, the Cyclopes, who forge ("excudunt") and shape ("fingunt") their product. Spee prefers the image of the masons, which he uses consist- ently and enlarges in several stanzas. The bees are a strange kind of masons (another "wunder"), who work without the usual tools, "bley und winckelmass" (p. 135, 2), and without the normal material, "bretter," "holz," "steine," and yet, to everybody's surprise, they are successful. Von bretter / holtz / noch steinen / Kein splitter brauchens nicht / Und doch (wer wolt es meinen) Der sch6ne baw geschicht. (Page 135, 3-6) Continuing the description of the res domestica, Spee proceeds logi- cally from the housing to its purpose, as dwelling, as storage, and as a 128</page><page sequence="12">SPEE AND VIRGIL place for raising children, "da ziehlens jhre zucht" (p. 135, 20). Spee emphasizes the cleanliness of the bees, another quality wherein they excel over humans (the tradition stems from Pliny). This shows in their individual cleanliness, "sich halten pur and rein," as well as in the sanitation, "Sie stanck noch wust erleiden/ er draussen fallt im flug," and in the general appearance of the abode. Recht sauber sie bewahren Die zelt= und kimmerlein. (Page 136, 5-6) All kinds of considerations of an ethical nature were traditionally spun around these characteristics, but Spee leaves them aside. He is amaz- ingly brief also on another quality which delighted classical antiquity, the sexless procreation of the bees .Virgil does not miss the opportunity of pointing out a rare wonder to Maecenas, "illum adeo placuisse apibus mirabere morem" (197)-the only time the verb "miror" is used in the narratio. Since the bees lived in a patriarchal state the question of procreation was particularly difficult to solve; on the other hand, this very fact played into the hands of Virgil who wanted to impress on the minds of the depraved Romans an example of chastity to echo the strict moral laws of Augustus. Virgil's bees did not indulge in sexual intercourse or bring forth their offspring with the pains of childbirth. quod neque concubitu indulgent, nec corpora segnes in Venerem solvunt aut fetus nixibus edunt. (Lines 198-9) There were two methods of procreation known to antiquity, one was "bugonia," the spontaneous generation of bees from the putrefaction of calf cadavers, and the simple gathering of offspring ready-made from trees and flowers. verum ipsae e foliis natos, e suavibus herbis ore legunt... (Lines 200-1) Both theories are found in treatises on apiculture in the seventeenth century. Spee uses this episode to add to the list of wonders, not to sermonize as Miss Rosenfeld suggests in her Neue Studien zur Lyrik von Friedrich von Spee, "Die moraltheologische Auswertung unter- scheidet die Spee'sche Dichtung von der klassischen" (p. 131). True to his intentio to praise not preach Spee devotes only one stanza to this topic without departing much from Virgil's version in content. But he arranges his material in such a way that half of the stanza deals with the situation and the other half with the remedy. 129</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Sie hauffig sich vermehren / Doch keusch / ohn heyrath sein; Ohn lieb sie sich beschwaren Mit siissen kinderlein. Sie nur von blumen lesen Die kleinen jhrer art; Da findet sich da3 wesen All jhrer Erben zart. (Page 136, 7-14) The few concluding stanzas in Spee's narratio have no relation with Virgil's Georgic. Spee describes the usefulness of the bees, their service to God and man. Quite contrary to Virgil's description of the violent mood of the bees when honey is removed from the hive, "illis ira modum supra est" (236), Spee extols their spontaneous generosity ("schen- cken") through several stanzas. Sie nur den frembden gisten [i.e., men] Die reichtumb haben spart/ Und uns gethan zum besten So manche blumen fart. (Page 139, 3-6) Although this tradition may have started with Pliny, who said that "they alone of this genus have been created for the sake of man," it seems more likely that it is taken from a little incident concerning Virgil which is found in many medieval anthologies of Virgil and his biographies. We can therefore speak of an indirect influence of Virgil on Spee's poem. Saddened by the fact that a poetaster obtained favors from Augustus by using his (Virgil's) poetry, Virgil is supposed to have drawn the parallel with bees, which gather honey but not for their own benefit, "sic vos non vobis mellificatis, apes."20 The generosity towards man by providing him with honey and wax is far surpassed by their service to God. Wer mensch mags auch erdencken/ Was jahrlich ohn verzug Dem lieben Gott sie schencken AuB jhrem blumen=flug? (Page 139, 15-18) By means of the wax which they produce and give to God, thousands and thousands of candles burn in churches day and night all over the world. And with this spectacle of festive illumination in honor of God (also a laudatio) where heaven and earth join forces the narratio is brought to an end. 20 H.

(Page 140, 3-6) Stylistic parallels between the two poems are few compared with the imitations in subject matter. In addition to the examples of conjunc- tivus jussivus mentioned above, there are several straight translations, like "hiiter" for "custos," "steinlein" for "lapillos," "riB" for "spira- menta." A point in question could also be the use of anthropomorphic forms. In Virgil they are found not only in the section de vita et noribus but elsewhere, as in the battle scene "pugna," "animos vulgi," "trepi- dantia corda," "magnisque vocant clamoribus hostem"). In Spee's collection anthropomorphisms abound in practically every poem, mostly in the form of verbs. It is therefore difficult to ascribe their occurrence in this poem to a direct influence of his model. However, one could argue that Spee most likely borrowed from Virgil the basic concept that bees are like humans and in some respects even superior to them. This may account for the fact that such forms pervade the poem from beginning to end, not only as verbs but also as nouns.21 Indeed some stanzas, if taken out of context, could well describe humans exclusively. Gleich die dan jhn begleiten / Und lauffen jhm zur hand: Gleich die dan draussen streitten Fiir jhre Burg und Land: Gleich die den p6ffel fiihren / Versorgen alle wacht: Gleich die den lufft erspiiren Auffs wetter gebend acht. (Page 134, 7-14) The reason for Spee's restraint in imitating Virgil's style is to be found in the theory of imitatio in vogue at his time. Known and prac- ticed in classical antiquity, imitatio was formulated by Petrarch; subse- quent centuries hammered out the details and produced a set of rules with suitable terminology. Spee may have followed Johannes Sturm's famous De imitatione oratoria libri tres (Argentorati, 1574), since all the devices we have seen used in this poem regarding the manipula- tion of the subject matter of the original are found properly identified and labeled in this book.22 21 Some examples relating to political life: freyheit, stolze biirgerschaft, er- wihlen, befehlen, ampter ertheilen, underthan. Housing: hdu/3lein, gebiw, bauen, bawxeug, balliert, mzaur und wand, zinmmer, kinminerlein, bley, winckelmap. Fam- ily life: heurath, siisse kinderlein, keusch, schine jugent, mitgenossen. 22 Most of this information is taken from the article by Gmelin quoted in note 12 above. 131</page><page sequence="15">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE In essence, Petrarch claimed that a poet should use the subject matter of other poets but should avoid the words: "Utendo igitur ingenio alieno . . . abstinendum verbis." Through his independent redisposition of the subject matter, and particularly through a com- pletely new poetic formulation (dissimilatio), the poet was imitating the bees: he was changing the literary nectar into an "aliud et melius." A look at Spee's poem will reveal how closely he adhered to the regu- lations of imitatio with respect to both content and style. As far as con- tent is concerned there is hardly anything original except the disposition. The form, on the other hand, is so much his own that many readers have never suspected Virgil as model. The changes he introduced were not artificial or arbitrary but were prompted by valid reasons. The elements which most conspicuously distinguish Spee's poem from Virgil's are the new versification and an entirely new idiom. Spee replaces Virgil's solemn and slow hexameter with a quicker iambic verse. This was dictated partly by his conception of poetics as applied to the German language and partly by the audience he was trying to reach. From the preface to Trutznachtigall we gather that he considered himself a pioneer in writing polished German poetry and felt that a few decisions regarding meter were to be made if the Germans at all in- tended to compare and compete ("Trutz") with the Latin and foreign poets. Curiously enough, the decisions he made were roughly the same as Opitz's, namely establishing the accent as the criterion for German metrics and the exclusion of all but the binary meters. Spee went even further than Opitz and declared the iambic meter the only one suitable to the German language, "dan dieser arten / sich am meisten in unser Teutschen sprach fiigen" (p. 6*, 25). The best confirmation of this fact he found in the poetry intended especially for the general public-folk songs and church hymns (we are in the period of the Counter-Reformation). He wished to reach precisely the same sector of society. In order to appeal to the simple people he also adopted a diction, a sort of genus humnile, which they could understand and enjoy (docere et delectare). There are certain elements in this poem which were clearly designed to appeal to the ordinary people, such as onomatopoetic effects, the choice of "pfann und becken" as musical instruments, the description of the swarm in terms of an Abschiedslied, and above all the humor which pervades the poem. Most of it is humor of expression in anthro- pomorphic verbs and nouns,23 but at one point he also portrays a 23 Some examples: "gaffen und gienen" (the blossoming of flowers), "schaben," "ausfriickeln" (to gather nectar), "sich tummeln" (the rejoicing of the bees), "sich wirbeln" (the sun's journey across the sky), "the fluigel=trab" (the flight of the swarm). 132</page><page sequence="16">SPEE AND VIRGIL humorous situation. At the end of de vita externa he describes the bees caulking the crevices of their hives, not to keep the cold out as in Virgil but to prevent the day and the sun, the "himmlisch augenball," from prying into the secrets of their internal organization. Dem tag sie weichen ferne/ Verkleben jhm die riB / DaB niemand nichts erlerne / Noch jhre stiicklein wiB (Page 133, 15-18) These arguments should not lead us to the quick conclusion that Spee's poems are all folksongs. Spee's style has a semblance of a genus humile, it is true, but this may be deceiving. In reality, he wanted to appeal to both the learned and the common people. At the end of the preface in one Strassburg manuscript there is a short paragraph which is significant, even though the author ultimately decided to delete it. In it he admits that there are a few poems in the collection "welche nitt so artig und poetisch seind. Aber das sein deren gar wenig, uber vier oder fiinff und ja den ungelehrten gefallen dieselben besser als die andere." On the other hand, when in the Trier manuscript he expresses the hope that his poetry will please the reader, he includes also the learned ones: "wie verhoffentlich es allen gelehrten gefallen wird" (p. xxvii). The best proof that he was not excluding the learned readers is found in the dedication, which was then commonly put on the title page. In all manu- scripts but, curiously enough, not in the printed edition, we read on the title page: "Allen geistlichen, gottliebenden Seelen, und sonderlich der poetischen kunst gelehrten Liebhabern zur Erquickung." He wrote for the religious-minded readers, but only connoisseurs familiar with the "ars poetica" would be able to appreciate it fully. For such readers Spee had other, more subtle, means of delectare ("Erquickung"), among them the use of mythology and rhetorical figures. Another source of delight was Spee's handling of the subject matter. Readers familiar with the Fourth Georgic could enjoy the imitatio and above all the aemulatio. Spee was attempting a double Kontrafaktur in changing a secular poem into a religious one, and a didactic poem into a laudatio. Morever, a connoisseur of "poetische kunst" could appreciate the structure of Spee's poem, the clear dis- positio, the numerical proportions and their symmetry, the ternary and binary patterns which he borrowed. More relevant is his tightening of the inner structure, the addition of the Ringkomposition, the eight- line stanza with all its possibilities of binary subdivisions, and above all the manner in which he stretches and contracts his subject matter so that it, too, becomes symmetrical and fits the pattern. 133</page><page sequence="17">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE We may add that this emphasis on order and symmetry was not merely a rhetorical requirement but was based on aesthetic and phil- osophic principles. Trunz says that it formed part of the baroque frame of mind. "Jede Kunsttheorie hat im Rahmen des barocken Welt- bildes die Aufgabe, die Kunst des Mikrokosmos so zu gestalten, daB sie dem Makrokosmos entspricht."24 We may add that in theory and in practice the poet was aware of this "cosmic" relationship, that it can, therefore, be found not only in the order of the books on poetics, as Trunz demonstrated, but also in the individual poem. This hypothesis will appear more likely if we consider that this order, which to the modern reader may appear a stifling artifice, wa;s in the past one of the most important aspects of beauty. "Nichts ist schoner, nichts fruchtbarer als die Ordung."25 This idea was contained in the very word "cosmos" which was originally an adjective meaning beautiful (hence our "cos- metics") but also orderly (the same applies to the Latin word "mun- dus"). There is still another argument which substantiates our hy- pothesis. This "cosmic" conception of art (found also in music and architec- ture, as Trunz indicates) was also known to the Middle Ages. It was part of a long tradition and, interestingly enough, the tradition is con- nected with Virgil. E. R. Curtius writes that it was the pagan Neoplato- nist Macrobius (around 400 A.D.) who first compared a poem to the cosmos, in his commentary to Virgil. "Es besteht also eine gro3e Ahnlichkeit zwischen dem divinum opus mundi und dem poeticum opus; zwischen dem deus opifex und dem poeta." Macrobius also claimed that Virgil knew that he would have to appeal to all his readers and therefore adopted the use of the multiple style. "Deshalb mischte er in seinem Werk alle Arten der Eloquenz und zwar non mortali sed divino ingenio.26 Since Macrobius was "fur das ganze Mittelalter eine philosophische und wissenschaftliche Autoritat,"27 we can easily see the source and the extent of the veneration of Virgil. It is difficult to say to what degree Spee was familiar with all these facets of the Virgilian tradition, but it is more than probable that he was. Indeed it would be extremely tempting to speculate that in this poem Spee may have been imitating Virgil not only in the subject matter but also in his use of the multiple style and in this "cosmic" conception of poetry. In other words, in this poem Spee may have wanted to show the Bienenstaat as an orderly microcosmos created with masterly crafts- 24 "Weltbild und Dichtung" in Aus der Welt des Barock, ed. R.

We trust that enough evidence has been produced in the course of this study to substantiate the claims made in our introdu'ction. For the study of Virgil's continued influence on Europe, Spee's poem on the bees is relevant on three grounds: the work imitated (Georgics), the time (seventeeth century), and the place (Germany). It is at the same time an interesting item to be added to the small list of poetic treat- ments of the Bienenstaat motif. Over and above these tangential aspects, the poem is valuable for the insight it gives us into Spee's poetry as imitatio and consequently also into all the poetry of the seventeenth century. It gives a different and, perhaps, more genuine picture of Spee as a poet. Spee emerges not as a preromantic but as a true poeta doctus rooted in the classical tradition to a degree heretofore unsuspected, if we take as indicative of the consensus Jacobsen's statement "daB seine direkte Anlehnung an die Antike hauptsachlich ein einzelnes Genre betrifft: die pastorale Ekloge" (p. 135). Equally unfounded appears Miss Rosenfeld's fear that this type of investigation, which relies on so much cultural information, ultimately loses sight of Spee and thus detracts from his stature as a poet: "... sicche affogando in un mare di cultura, si perde di vista Federico Spee e l'opera sua."28 Quite the contrary is true. In the light of imitatio this "mare di cultura," the tradition, is absolutely necessary for the correct understanding of the poet as a gatherer of literary nectar and in evaluating his own creative contribution, which is considerable. We must grant, however, that this type of originality should not be identi- fied with that called for by aesthetic theories of a later date which were unknown to the seventeenth century and therefore hardly applicable to it without danger of misrepresentation. Goethe was right when he compared poems to "gemalte Fensterscheiben" which become "farbig helle" only when seen from inside the chapel. The same applies to the poet as well. He should be studied in the context of his times and of the tradition to which he belongs. University of North Carolina, Greensboro 28 Neue Studien, p. 8.
