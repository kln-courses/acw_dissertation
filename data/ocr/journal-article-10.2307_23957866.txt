A. Knibb with the assistance of E. Ullendorff Although interest in the Ethiopic book of Enoch is today more intense than ever, scholars have still to rely on the text (1906) and translation (1922) of R. H. Charles. Subsequent manuscript discoveries, particularly that of the important Dead Sea fragments in Aramaic, the language in which most of the book was originally written, have necessitated this new edition.

Collange (trs. A. W. Heathcote) Saint Paul's Epistle to the Philippians reflects more than any other of his letters the personality and sensitivity of the apostle. It was written at a decisive period in his life and addressed to a community with which he had especially close ties, so that he lets himself speak from his heart as well as from his faith. He voices his conviction that Christianity is no escape from the world but following the steps of the Lord who himself became man it assumes responsibility for a humanity which is henceforward open to the approach of God. The commentary by J.-F. Collange makes every effort after rigorous, scientifically controlled exegesis. It attempts to answer the questions which the reader of the epistle will raise, questions which are now classic.

Professor McDonagh outlines the problems inherent in constructing a specifically Christian social ethics, and then goes on to analyse social ethics in terms of the individual's relationship to the community, in particular in our relationship to the state. In his final chapter he discusses the relationship between human society and the Kingdom of God. The theology of social ethics which results from his analysis provides a fresh insight into the foundation of ethical thinking in human experience and challenges the church not to retreat into self-absorption. £2-75 paper THE DEFENCE OF TRUTH HERBERT OF CHERBURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY R D Bedford This is the first comprehensive study in English of the philosophical writings of Edward Herbert, first Baron of Cherbury (1581 /2-1648) Dr Bedford reassesses his position in the evolution of deistic thought. £7-50 approx MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY PRESS Oxford Road Manchester M13 9PL [41</page><page sequence="7">From From our autumn list. ..
