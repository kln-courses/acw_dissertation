Beshty's latest photographs are almost entirely face of a 1976 painting—meaning, I assume, that he works on abstract, verging on psychedelic; there is no referent available for one thing after another. Aside from an abiding interest in the pho- us to ponder outside the technical means employed in their making, tographic medium, its particular history and its impact on history The earlier "pieces" do not exactly anticipate this more recent in general, the work evinces a restless, roving curiosity.

More specifically, these moves point back to a photography that still unfolds in two distinct stages, continuously alternating between poles of darkness and light. One is reminded of the tech nical symmetry between the analog camera and the darkroom, both of which operate on the principle of exposure, brief flashes of illumination within a space otherwise sealed shut. By removing these crucial parts of the process—that is, first the apparatus of the camera and the enlarger, and then light—Beshty leaves us with a kind of blind photography. The ultimate eradication of any outlying worldly content in favor of this inward-turning loop of self reflexivity is underwritten by a sound structuralist logic and dis tantly recalls the filmic exploits of such figures as Harry Smith and Stan Brakhage, who likewise applied their hands directly to the sur face of their chosen medium. From the earliest futurist attempts to take film in a more painterly direction, either by way of conventional animation techniques or by painting directly onto celluloid, to the wholly film-free glass-slide and Petri-dish projections of chemical reactions and living cultures by Joshua White and the Boyle Family, these precedents clearly demonstrate how the path of technical reduction can sometimes lead to visual excess. Film simply can not survive without light, however, and the fact that photography not only can, but appears to thrive in darkness, is one of the great revelations of Beshty's work. Where does this leave the self? One answer might be sought in the contemporary ascendancy of biology over physics as the dominant science, a turn that is reflected in a range of current fascinations from eco-sustainability to genetic engineering.
