S. HALDANE. THE subject of this discussion, as I understand it, is whether the general conceptions or" "categories" ordinarily used in interpreting physical, biological and psychological phenomena are essentially different and irreconcilable with one another. In approaching this question, I think we must carefully distinguish between the conceptions, or, as I should prefer to say, working hypotheses, which we commonly use in inter- preting reality, and that reality itself. The discussion applies to our working hypotheses or categories; and I propose to maintain that our ordinary working conceptions of what we regard as physical, biological and psychological phenomena are not only different, but irreducible to one another. I will deal first with the difference between physical and biological interpretations of experience. The theory which aims at interpreting the phenomena of life as nothing but physical and chemical phenomena, accompanied, it may be, by consciousness, is generally known as the mechanistic theory of life. The theory which, on the contrary, interprets biological phenomena in terms of a special conception based on the observation of life itself may be called the biological theory. Of these opposing theories each seeks to interpret the same facts in its own way, and the one way is completely different from the other. But there is also an intermediate theory-that known as vitalism. The vitalists accept as true, so far as it</page><page sequence="2">12 J. S. HALDANE. goes, the physical and chemical interpretation of the phenomena connected with living organisms, but maintain that in living organisms we must in addition assume the existence of some- thing quite distinct which interferes with and guides the physical and chemical reactions. This something has been called " vital force," " the vital principle," or, to use Driesch's expression, "entelechy." So long as the vitalists confine themselves to merely pointing out the deficiences of the purely mechanistic theory, the evidence which they bring forward is so strong that it seems to me to be unanswerable. When, however, they try to define vitalism on its positive side the result is quite indefinite. The something which was supposed to interfere from without in the physical and chemical reactions can always be shown by experiment to be dependent on what were admitted to be physical and chemical conditions, though there is no explanation of how these conditions bring about the actual results. Vitalism thus represents no clearly definable working hypothesis, and for this reason I do not propose to consider it further. Similar objections apply to the corre- sponding animistic theory in psychology. I shall now try to present shortly the mechanistic argument and what seem to me its fatally weak points. The. conception of a living organism as a mechanism is in some respects quite natural and very useful. We can, for instance, understand up to a certain point the movements of the limbs if we regard the bones as levers acted on by the contractions of the muscles. It is equally natural to seek for corresponding mechanical explanations of the contraction of muscle; and though definite progress in this direction has hitherto been limited I feel confident that we are on the eve of such progress. When we turn to any other form of bodily activity we find similarly that physical and chemical explanations will carry us a long step forwards. Thus, the chemistry of the blood enables us to see exactly how oxygen is carried from the lungs to the tissues, and carbon dioxide is carried from the tissues to the lungs; the</page><page sequence="3">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 13 chemistry of the digestive secretions enables us to understand the chemical changes in digestion; and the structure of the eye and the laws of optics show us how an image is formed on the retina. At first sight, therefore, it seems justifiable to assume that, if our knowledge of the chemistry and physics of the living body were sufficiently complete, we could explain completely all the phenomena occurring in living organisms. It used often to be stated confidently that the develop- ment of physiology shows a continuous advance towards a mechanical explanation of life; and this statement is at present widely accepted. It is certainly true that physical and chemical explanations are being profitably applied to more and more of the phenomena associated with life. It is, however, equally true that more and more of these phenomena are being found to be quite insusceptible of the simple mechanical explanations which were formerly given of them. Fifty years ago many physiological processes which, from a physical and chemical standpoint, are now seen to be extremely complex and obscure, were regarded as quite simple. I need only refer to such activities as the oxidative processes in living tissues, the processes of secretion and absorption, or reflex action. There is a prevalent idea that the progress of chemistry, and particularly of physical chemistry, has furnished explanations of these processes. This is most certainly not the case. What physical chemistry has helped us to do is to obtain measures of the processes in the living body ; but the results of the measurements have been to show with ever-increasing clearness that the processes in the living body do not correspond with our conceptions of those in non-living structures, and that we are not remotely in sight of mechanical explanations of the former. As an example, I need only take the case of the exquisitely thin and delicate living membrane which separates the blood in the lung capillaries from the air in the alveoli or air-cells of the lungs. A short time ago it was assumed that this membrane</page><page sequence="4">14 J. S. HALDANE. plays only the passive part which we regard a non-living membrane as plhying, and allows oxygen to diffuse through just as a non-living membrane would. On applying accurate methods of measurement we found that, whenever there is need for an extra supply of oxygen, as, for instance, during muscular exertion, the membrane assumes an active r6le and pushes oxygen inwards, without regard to the mechanical laws of diffusion. In this respect the alveolar epithelium acts just like epithelium of the swim-bladder, or that of the kidney or any other gland, or the alimentary canal. The progress of physical chemistry is enabling us to distinguish sharply between physiological activity and the processes occurring in non-living structures; and the establishment of the distinction is sweeping away the easy-going mechanistic explanations which became current during the latter half of last century. On the whole, there is no evidence of real progress towards a mechanistic explanation of life; and those physiologists who still believe that the mechanistic line of attack is the right one are compelled to justify their belief on general philosophical grounds. We ought, they say, to advance from the simple to the complex; from the sure and familiar ground of physics and chemistry to the unknown ground of biology. Practically speaking, they argue that life mus.t be a mechanical process, although at present we cannot understand the mechanism. Now, I wish to go straight to the point, and explain why, as it seems to me, life cannot be regarded as a mechanical process. A living organism differs in this respect from any mechanism which we can construct or conceive, that it forms itself and keeps itself in working order and activity. Bearing this in mind, let us look again at the various apparent mechanisms previously referred to. The bones and muscles involved in limb-movements have not only developed into the particular arrangement which renders them efficient, but from hour to hour and day to day nutritive activities are occurring in them which keep this arrangement intact. More-</page><page sequence="5">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 15 over, the actual movements are, apart altogether from conscious interference, guided and controlled at every point. These are facts which the mechanical explanation does not account for. When we look closely into the changes occurring in a muscle doing muscular work we see that reproduction of the muscular substance is an integral part of these changes. The wonderfully beautiful balance of chemical composition which enables the blood to perform correctly its work in carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide depends no less evidently on constant and minute regulation. The formation and liberation of the digestive ferments is likewise minutely regulated; and the same is true of the exact form and optical properties of the refractive structures of the eye. Moreover, the whole of these wonderfully delicately balanced mechanisms have originally developed from a single cell containing no trace of the future structures. It is thus evident that, although we find within the living body many phenomena which, so long as we do not look closely, can be interpreted satisfactorily as physical and chemical mechanism, there are side by side other phenomena for which the possibility of such interpretation seems to be absent. The mechanists assume that the bodily mechanisms are so constructed as to maintain, repair, and reproduce themselves. In the long process of natural selection, mechanisms of this sort have, they suggest, been evolved gradually. Let us examine this hypothesis. When we state an event in mechanical terms we state it as a necessary result of certain simple properties of separate parts which interact in the event. Thus, it is through the interaction of rigid bones of a certain configuration with contractile muscles attached to them at certain points that we explain the movements of a limb. Similarly, it is in terms of the inter- action of oxygen molecules with the molecules of haemoglobin</page><page sequence="6">16 J. S. HALDANE. aId other substances in blood that we explain the taking up of oxygen by venous blood. The essence of the explanation or re-statement of the event is that after due investigation we have assumed that the parts interacting in the event have certain simple and definite properties, so that they always react in the same way under the same conditions. For a mechanical explanation the reacting parts must first be given. Unless an arrangement of parts with definite properties is given it is meaningless to speak of mechanical explanation. To postulate the existence of a self-producing or self- maintaining mechanism is, thus, to postulate something to which no meaning can be attached. Meaningless terms are sometimes used by physiologists; but there is none so abso- lutely meaningless as the expression "mechanism of repro- duction." Any mechanism there may be in the parent organism is absent in the process of reproduction, and must reconstitute itself at each generation, since the parent organism is reproduced from a mere tiny speck of its own body. There can be no " mechanism" of reproduction. The idea of a mechanism which is constantly maintaining or reproducing its own structure is self-contradictory. A mechanism which reproduced itself would be a mechanism without parts, and, therefore, not a mechanism. Let us try to get nearer to what the self-reproduction and self-maintenance of an organism implies. Perhaps, the clearest analogy in the inorgadic world to the reproduction of an organism is the reproduction of a crystal. By increasing the external pressure, or adding heat, we can cause a crystal of ice to waste away by melting. If, however, we remove the pressure, or the heat, the crystal re-forms and grows to its former size. We can also, with proper precautions, cool water to below the freezing-point without any ice forming. But if to the supercooled water we add the smallest crystal of ice it rapidly grows into a larger crystal, just as the germ of an organism grows. The molecules of water possess the property</page><page sequence="7">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 17 of attracting one another in such a way as to produce mutual orientation or arrangement, in which they take up more space than when they were present as a mere mobile crowd in the liquid state; and in the starting of the process of orientation some initial hindrance has to be overcome, so that crystallisa- tion occurs far more readily if it is given a start. We must assume that each molecule possesses the property of so attracting each other molecule as to produce the mutual orientation if there is no hindrance from pressure or from the molecular agitation due to heat, or from other causes. An organism maintains itself through a balance between constant loss and gain, whereas the crystal of water seems at first sight not to change except by growth or melting away. When we look closer, however, we find that the crystal has a vapour pressure. It is, therefore, constantly giving off, and must be equally constantly taking up, water-molecules from its environment. Hence, in this respect also, it resembles an organism. Where the resemblance fails is that the arrangement of the molecules in the crystal is mere repetition, whereas in the organism there is individual variety of detail, and yet perfectly definite and specific unity of plan. For the formation of the crystal it is necessary that each molecule of water should have the property of tending to orientate itself to any other in a certain definite manner. Mere central forces of attraction do not explain the formation of a crystal from molecules or of a molecule from atoms. Similarly, in the ievelopment of an organism we seem bound to assume that the germ has the pro- perty of tending to orientate towards itself certain surrounding molecules in the specific arrangement of the fully developed organism, and that these surrounding molecules have corre- sponding properties. It may be pointed out that this is no explanation. Nor is it meant to be an explanation. It is a mere general statement of what appear to be the facts of observation. In mechanical B</page><page sequence="8">18 J. S. HALDANE. physics we have become accustomed to think of molecules or atoms as quite simple things with easily definable properties, such as mass, extension, and central forces of attraction. For biology, the properties which must be assumed in a unit of living structure are enormously more complex, and are only capable at present of statement in general terms. It is solely from previous actual observation that we can predict how the living structure will behave, and we can only do so if the environment is about the same as in the previous observation. Practically, therefore, we must look uporn organism and environment as one interconnected whole, which, as a matter of empirical fact, tends to maintain itself, just as a crystal and its mother-liquor do, or a molecule and the solution in which it has formed. From no elementary mechanical prin- ciples can we deduce the behaviour of even the molecule of water in crystallisation; and similarly, from no elementary physical or chemical principles can we deduce the behaviour of the organism. It is owing to this empirical fact that the ordinary working hypotheses of physics and chemistry are irreconcilable with those of biology. The tacit assumption is often made that in mechanical physics we reach a definition of the ultimate reality of which the visible world consists. For many practical purposes this definition, it is true, suffices. But even in connection with heat, light, and electricity, the definition is insufficient. In chemistry it breaks down still more, and in biology the breakdown is complete. Like pure mathematics, mechanical physics is only an abstract science. We can use it for certain practical purposes, but it tells us only a very little about reality, and in only a very imperfect form. Let me illustrate my meaning by reference to the kinetic theory of gases-a subject which has been specially engaging me lately. For the kinetic theory of gases, a gas is an assembly of molecules kept in motion by heat, with the necessary conse- quence that each molecule, whatever its mass may be, possesses</page><page sequence="9">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 19 on an average the same amount of kinetic energy. Hence, an equal number of gas molecules will always produce the same bombardment pressure at the same temperature, and from this pressure we obtain an absolute scale of temperature. In this way we can predict from the theory the three well-known "gas-laws," called, after their discoverers, Boyle's, Charles's and Avogadro's laws. These laws are embodied in the equa- tion PV = RT, where P = pressure, V = volume, T = absolute temperature, and R is a constant for each gas, but varies for different gases in inverse proportion to their molecular weights. Now, it is evident that this equation can only hold good if molecules are regarded as points with mass, but without exten- sion. Some mathematical physicists have clung tenaciously to this idea and to the equation. There we must leave them, because we are not dealing with mathematical figments, but with reality in so far as it is revealed to us in experience. As a matter of fact, the equation PV = RT has only the appear- ance of holding within certain limits of temperature and pressure. If the temperature falls or the pressure increases sufficiently, the value of PV becomes greater than RT, because the volume of the molecules themselves begins to count. Hence, if we call v the volume occupied by the molecules, we must alter the equation to P (V-.v) = RT. If the molecules were simply indifferent to one another, so that they merely repelled one another on contact, we should now have an equation expressing the behaviour of a gaseous substance. But, as a matter of fact, even the amended equation does not express the behaviour of actual gases, for, with sufficient cooling, gases condense to liquids. The molecules attract one another, and with cooling their kinetic energy is reduced progressively so that on an average a constantly increasing proportion, of them must be within their mutual spheres of attraction, like the bodies in a solar system, and hence exercise no external pressure. We must, therefore, alter the significance of P, so that it means, not external, but B2</page><page sequence="10">20 J. S. HALDANE. intermolecular pressure. We can, then, as I have elsewhere endeavoured to show, not only extend the gas-laws to liquids, but by means of them predict with great accuracy a very large number of facts. There remain other facts, however, which we cannot predict, for with sufficient further fall of temperature a liquefied gas crystallises. It doing so it may, like water or molten iron, increase in bulk. Now, the simple assumptions on which the kinetic theory of gases and liquids is based are insufficient to explain the phenomena of crystallisation, with the accom- panying abrupt change of volume and of other properties. We must, therefore, assume, not merely that the molecules attract one another in the directions joining their centres, after the manner of gravitation, but that they tend to assume a definite position, pole to pole, in relation to one another, and actually assume this position as soon as their mutual move- ments, due to heat, are insufficient to prevent them from doing so. The liquid thus crystallises at a perfectly definite tem- perature, unless its enormous intermolecular pressure is sensibly increased by added external pressure. This shows us that when we look closely at actual molecules we are forced to the conclusion that the tendency to take specific form or arrangement is always present in molecules, and, therefore, in what we call matter. We cannot sum up the properties of molecules in the conceptions of mass, extension, and central forces proportional to mass, in accordance with the fundamental physical conceptions of Newton. The actual pro- perties of molecules can only be expressed in terms of their potential orientations to various other kinds of molecules; and, when we pass beyond the comparatively simple empirical facts relating to crystallisation, when we consider also the limitless empirical facts of chemistry, we can see that the physical conceptions of extension and central forces connecting masses are nothing but imperfect representations of reality, however useful these imperfect representations may be within</page><page sequence="11">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 21 certain limits. The reality is far more than these conceptions can express. From yet another point of view the abstract mechanical conception of a molecule is unreal. We now possess abundant evidence that molecules, just like crystals or other gross molecular aggregates, are in a state of constant decomposition and recomposition. So far may this process go in very dilute solutions of what are distinguished as electrolytes, that for all practical purposes their molecules hardly exist as such, and only the dissociated fragments are present. Thus, a very dilute solution of sodium chloride or hydrochloric acid contains, practically speaking, only the ions formed by the dissolution of the molecules of sodium chloride or hydrochloric acid. I need, perhaps, hardly refer in detail to the very great signific- ance of the conception of ionisation first introduced by Faraday, and the manner in which this conception has developed until it has transformed the whole outlook of both chemistry and physics. It is now evident that not merely gross aggregates, but also molecules and atoms, are in a state of constant decomposition, recomposition, and internal action. Their mass and extension appear to be nothing but an expression of this action; and, if so, the distinction between matter and energy, or between structure and its activity, becomes only an imperfect representation of the actual world. There are, thus, no real grounds for the contention that life must, in ultimate analysis, be capable of ointerpretation as a mechanical process. We must base our working conception of life on actual observation of living organisms, and certainly not on mechanical conceptions. Even from the purely physical standpoint, these are no longer adequate, but only provisional working hypotheses, useful for certain limited practical pur- poses, like the gas laws in either their original or amended form. Empirical observations with regard to the behaviour of living organisms point clearly to the conclusion that in each detail of organic structure, composition, environment, and</page><page sequence="12">22 J. S. THALDANE. activity there is a manifestation or expression of the life of the organism regarded as a whole which tends to persist. It is this manifestation which distinguishes biological phenomena; and, through all the temporary variations of structure, activity, composition and environment, it can be traced more and more clearly with every year of advance in biological investigation. We can trace it through the ordinary metabolic phenomena in living organisms, as well as through the phenomena of senescence, death, and reproduction. As it seems to me, it is only through the central working hypothesis or category of life that we can bring unity and intelligibility into the group of phenomena with which biology deals; and it is because the biological working hypothesis is for the present absent in our ordinary conceptions of physical and chemical phenomena that we must treat physical and biological categories as radically different. The popular and completely natural distinction between the living and non-living is thus wholly justified on the ground that biological observations cannot be expressed or described in terms of ordinary physical working hypotheses. For a more detailed discussion of this position in the light of the empirical facts of physiology I may, perhaps, refer to my recent book, Organism and Environment. I must now pass to the question whether biological and psychological categories must also be treated as different. To this question it seems to me that there are still clearer reasons for returning an affirmative answer. When we examine the organic wholeness and persistency which shows itself in the life of an organism we see at once that life is limited on all sides by what we can only interpret as physical and chemical conditions. If the oxygen percentage in the air breathed falls low enough, or the external tem- perature rises or falls sufficiently, life no longer dominates the phenomena. In every direction we see similar limitations. A plant may be regarded as the type of what appears to be</page><page sequence="13">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 23 a mere organism. It is very sensitive to changes in its environ- ment, and is helpless against numerous accidental changes, though human foresight can often quite easily guard it. A conscious organism is distinguished by the manner in which it overcomes these hindrances. It is aware of, and avoids, neutralises, or even takes advantage of them. It adapts its behaviour in such a manner as to maintain itself in the presence of what is outside the mere organic unity of its life. But in so doing the organism shows itself to be more than a mere organism; it includes within the unity of its life what seemed to be independent. In other words, the biological interpretation of the phenomena of organisms is only a partial interpretation, just as the physical interpretation is a still more partial interpretation. The reaction between a conscious organism and its environ- ment is wholly different from the immediacy of what we interpret as physical or physiological reaction. In physical or physiological reaction one object reacts directly with another in space, but only in space; the reaction is immediate or "blind." Into conscious reaction, both the actual past and the potential future enter directly also. Objects of consciousness determine directly and are determined directly by past and future, as well as simultaneous, objects of consciousness. A psychological object is thus in dynamic relation with other objects surround- ing it, not merely in space, but also in time. It has therefore an element of timelessness, inasmuch as it is in direct relation not only with present, but also with future and past objects. It represents action at a distance, not only in space, but also in time. The physical world which we seem to see so plainly around us is reality as it appears in our consciousness. It is a reality of objects of consciousness, the constant presence of which guides all our conscious actions. What guides us is our knowledge of objects. This knowledge is there and constantly active, though the objects as physical or biological objects are</page><page sequence="14">24 J. S. HALDANE. out of sight or contact, so that their immediate influence is entirely absent. It has already been pointed out that the world of mathe- mnatical physics is a very imperfect presentation of reality, and that in the biological world much more of reality is presented. In the world of psychology still more of reality comes before us. The real world is not merely a physical or biological world, but also a known world. In identifying it as a known world we are making use of an additional category or working hypothesis. What makes this necessary is simply the nature of the empirical facts. A world which is not a known world means as little to us as a world in which the equation PV = RT holds good absolutely, or a world of atoms indifferent to one another. Such worlds are ideal figments of our imagi- nation, though the figments are very useful for certain limited purposes. In judging of the nature of reality we have no right to exclude the facts which emerge in either biological or psychological observation. It would be just as reasonable to exclude from physics or chemistry all the facts relating to ionisation. Conscious activity is a part of our objective universe, and must be taken account of in our judgments of reality. Consciousness has been looked upon as a mere accompani- ment of physical and chemical changes in nerve-cells. As has been already pointed out, the active changes within the living body cannot be interpreted as mere physical and chemical changes. An alternative view is that conscious activity is a subjective accompaniment of what we interpret as vital activity. To me it seems clear that this view is not possible. Vital activity is "blind." This means that the organic unity which we can always identify in vital or biological activity is immediate in character. An unconscious organism adapts itself to new con- ditions, but only through a process which appears to be essentially as blind as the action of gravitation. In the process</page><page sequence="15">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 25 of reproduction the germ might seem as if it were realising a conscious plan of the fully developed organism. Embryological investigation indicates, however, that each step in development is the immediate outcome of the conditions existing at the moment. If these conditions are abnormal the development will also be abnormal, so that all sorts of monstrosities are possible. It is true that for a mere organism the past lives on in the present, and there is a sense in which we can speak of organic memory. But we might equally describe this organic persistency as of the same nature as inertia. It does not present the character of conscious memory. In perception and conscious reaction to it we are in contact with pienomena which we cannot interpret in terms of either physical or biological conceptions. An object which has been perceived is present to, and directly influences, both future and past objects of perception, so that their influence on con- scious action is altered. When Faraday pointed out the existence of ions in solutions he made a discovery which has gradually exercised a more and more wide-spread influence on scientific and practical activity, and has at the same time given a new significance to previous discoveries. In every new act of perception, however unimportant, there is a similar influence on the reactions to future, present and past perceptions. To what we regard as mere organism the past is simply a dead weight on the present, and the present on the future, just as in the case of what we regard as mere physical existence. It has been assumed widely that, while we can directly perceive physical or biological phenomena, we cannot perceive psychological phenomena directly, since they have no "objective " existence, and are only subjective accompaniments hidden behind, and possibly determining, objective physical and physiological changes. This assumption is baseless. The objective behaviour of a conscious organism or person is quite distinct from that of an unconscious organism, although at the lowest stages of consciousness the distinction may be so</page><page sequence="16">26 J. S. HALDANE. faintly marked that we are left in doubt, just as at the lowest stages of life we can hardly distinguish the living from the non-living. When we perceive a person it is most certainly a person, and not a mere organism, that we perceive. It is only by a process of abstraction from the full objective reality that we can regard him as a mere organism. The doctor or physiologist is constantly performing with great pains this act of abstraction, and the engineer or economist performs a still more violent act of abstraction when he regards the man as a motor or working unit, or as a weight to be carried. By a similar effort we can abstract from the objective reality of what is beautiful. It is, of course, only by interpretation of our experience that we perceive psychological phenomena. But exactly the same is true of biological and physical phenomena. The physical realities which seem to lie so clear and solid in front of us are only bundles of interpretations in the light of previous and co-existing and anticipated experiences, all determining the existing experience. Even if, following Hume, we seek to disentangle the sensations forming the crude basis of these interpretations, we are no better off. The simplest sensation carries interpretation with it, as Kant showed. The "objective " world is nothing but the world as interpreted in knowledge, and the physical or biological worlds are only abstractions from this objective world. Not only when we are observing psychological phenomena in other persons, but when we are studying natural phenomena of all kinds, is our world a psychological or spiritual world. Perhaps, we realise this best when the progress of experimental science leads to a reconsideration of fundamental physical interpreta- tions which, like those of mass, energy, or unchangeable atoms, have been employed without question for long periods. We have to go back to what was in the minds of those who established these interpretations. I will now try to summarise the argument of this paper</page><page sequence="17">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 27 When we make use of physical categories, we are employing simplified maxims or principles which, on account of their simplicity, are very convenient for purposes of prediction, but which can only be used over a limited extent of our experience without gross error. When we attempt to apply them to biological or psychological phenomena, the error becomes apparent; we cannot express biological or psychological experience in terms of physical conceptions. In other words, we cannot reduce biological and psychological to physical categories. Similarly, in biology we are also employing relatively simplified maxims which enable us to predict another large class of phenomena, but which cannot be applied to what we distinguish as psychological phenomena without gross error. Hence we cannot reduce psychological to biological categories. We may ask why, in interpreting the physical world, we make use of schematised conceptions which biological and even physical and chemical observations prove to be untenable. The reality behind atoms and molecules, for instance, is evidently far more than the schematised atoms and molecules of ordinary physics and chemistry. The answer is that for a large number of purposes the schematised conceptions are practically sufficient, and give us a short cut without which we should be helpless in practical affairs, since we have not the data for framing more adequate conceptions correctly. For biological phenomena the schematised physical conceptions are insufficient practically; and we must, therefore, make use of spqcial biological con- ceptions, the relation of which to the physical conceptions must for the present remain more or less obscure for lack of data. It is the same as regards the relation of psychological to biological conceptions. For certain ordinary practical purposes we treat the biological and physical worlds as objective and independent of our knowledge of them; but this is only a convenient figment From the point of view of each individual science there is a conflict of categories or fundamental hypotheses with those of</page><page sequence="18">28 J. S. HALDANE. other sciences; but from the wider standpoint of philosophy these categories are only provisional working hypotheses. The world of our experience is a spiritual world, as already pointed out above; and this being so we must regard categories as only forms which the riches of this spiritual world pass through in the course of their ever fuller manifestation.</page><page sequence="19">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 29 SYMPOSIUM: ARE PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IRREDUCIBLE? II.-By D'ARcY WENTWORTH THOMPSON. THE great astronomers have given us a " Micanique COleste," and the great physiologists have sketched for us a " MWcanique Humaine." The one was drawn, by Newton and Laplace, to a strict mathematical scale; the other, more complex and specific, is traced with a freer hand, on lines laid down by the phydicists and by the chemists. If neither gives us a consummate and ultimate explanation of things, or even a complete ratio eficiendi of the working of its particular machine, both alike give us an admirable ratio cogitandi; they serve the purpose of ordering our thoughts, of correlating our knowledge, of anticipating phenomena, of climbing slowly but steadily (not without many a false step here and there) up the pathway of discovery. But now Dr. Haldane throws down a challenge to the naturalist, and in particular to the physiologist; for he tells us, in effect, that we have mixed up alien concepts, that in applying the "mechanical" laws of chemistry and physics to living things we have confused our categories, and that " biological observations cannot be expressed or described in the terms of ordinary physical working hypotheses." It is with some reluctance, I confess, that I enter on this discussion. The naturalist has his hands full of relatively simple problems; he approaches them in his own way, he solves, or tries to solve them, by his own accustomed methods. But he is afraid, generally speaking, of the larger problems which lie beyond; and his fear may be justified, or at all events pardoned,</page><page sequence="20">30 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. or at least condoned. When we speak of Life itself, we know that we speak of a great mystery. We seem to have stepped unbidden upon holy ground. Ignorance beclouds our thoughts, traditional beliefs disturb our minds, and ineradicable pre- conceptions interfere with our endeavours to ratiocinate. We confess our ignorance, we admit our failure, we seek refuge inl "intuition," or we are lost in wonderment. Yet now and then we take our courage in both hands, lay aside our comfortable intuitions, endeavour to face the facts, acknowledge our difficulties, and open to review and criticism our half-formulated creeds. If these things are to be discussed at all, let me at least attempt to narrow the great issue. Dr. Haldane sets out to prove that, for the three several sciences, or disciplines, of physics, biology and psychology, the general conceptions with which we should approach them, the categories by which it behoves us to interpret them, are essentially different, incompatible, irreconcilable, irreducible. At once and willingly, I grant the point as regards psychology. That matter and mind are incommensurables seems to my judgment so obvious that it needs no argument and risks no serious denial. It involves, doubtless, an uncomfortable dualism, an awkward breach in the continuity of our thinking. I must leave it at that; and be content to state rather than to defend my dualistic attitude. Biology, then, for the present, I take to mean the study of the forms, whether gross or molecular, assumed by matter in the fabric of living things, and all the changes, processes, activities associated therewith, so far (and it seems to me a long, long way) as we can study them apart from consciousness, or " conscious reactions." I am not without some lurking fear that I may here be charged with a petitio principii. Professor Ward has told us (for instance) that " if we begin from the material side we must keep to this side all through; if Matter is to explain Life at all, it must explain all life." And the converse</page><page sequence="21">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 31 is also maintained by many; that if a psychical element be admitted in Life at all, it must be admitted in all life; if by means of it we interpret the behaviour of some living things, so must we explain them all; if some actions of living things, then all actions; in short that, apart from psychology, there is no biology at all.* Howsoever this may be, in the meanwhile Dr. Haldane spares me the trouble of deciding. I am applying myself to his brief; and he discriminates very explicitly between the psychological and " biological " categories, deelaring that " the reaction between a conscious organism and its environment is wholly different from the immediacy of what we interpret as physical, or [even as] physiological reaction." In another very important way Dr. Haldane himself narrows our issue, by setting wholly aside that " intermediate theory " of " vitalism" which lies (as he says) between the physical or mechanistic interpretation and what he designates, ~T' ~oX~v, as the " biological theory." That is to say, he will have no dealings with any of those who "accept as true, so far as it goes, the physical and chemical interpretation of the phenomena connected with living organisms, but maintain that in living organisms we must in addition assume the existence of some- thing quite distinct, which interferes with and guides the physical and chemical reactions."t Such views seem, in Dr. Haldane's judgment, to be neither fish, fowl, nor good red herring. "Vitalism," he says " represents no clearly definable working hypothesis, and for this reason I do not propose to consider it further." I am not sure that I understand him. But I take him to mean that vitalism is but a perverted mechanism, * So, for instance, Dr. James Ward says, in Heredity and Memory, " We find then no ground for separating organic life from psychical life ; for us all life is experience, etc." t I fear that Dr. Hobhouse is introducing something quite indis- tinguishable from the ordinary hypothesis of vitalism as, described above, when he speaks of a living being as a " psychophysical whole " containing elements-" forces if you will "-which hold its parts together and correlate their action.</page><page sequence="22">32 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. a theory which would still explain the whole in terms of its parts, and which merely superadds to the known (and seemingly inadequate) parts of the mechanism a new, nondescript kind of part, to wit, entelechy. At all events from our immediate discussion the hypotheses of the vitalists are withheld, and they trouble us no more. I take it that all this clears away many things from our immediate field of debate; among other things, that it sets aside that subconscious or unconscious memory, that "Mneme," to which Hering introduced us some 50 years ago, which Samuel Butler has so subtly analysed, and which Dr. Ward has of late so warmly championed. I part with it with regret; almost the first little paper I ever wrote-I wrote it well-nigh forty years ago, when I was a Cambridge undergraduate-was an attempt to expound and to advocate that fascinating but (as I think now) that elusive and slippery doctrine. There is still a lion in our path, and it is a formidable one; for it is nothing less than the great metaphysical concept of Reality. This lion, however, is chained. For Dr. Haldane, at the very outset of his paper, tells us that " we must carefully distinguish between the conceptions, or, as I should prefer to say, working hypotheses, which we commonly use in inter- preting reality, and that reality itself." And then he imme- diately assures us that this "discussion applies to our working hypotheses or categories." Reality, it is true, appears again, and yet again, in Dr. Haldane's paper; and now and then we begin to be afraid of it, and once at least it seems to " straddle quite across the whole breadth of the way." Dr. Haldane makes much of the fact that, "like pure mathematics," mechanical physics "tells us only a very little about reality, and in only a very imperfect form." (I might demur, and demur strongly, to the inclusion of pure mathematics, but let that pass.) He denounces the "tacit assumption that in mechanical physics ive reach a definition of the ultimate reality of which the visible</page><page sequence="23">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 33 world consists "; he shows that the definition is insufficient; he then, this being so, has no difficulty in maintaining that the same insufficiency extends also to chemistry and to biology. I do not question it. I accept the metaphysical position. I have no quarrel with metaphysics: I have no wish in the world to contend that the great concept of ultimate Reality is but a toothless lion, or, worse still, a chimera with a lion's head. But, it belongs to the metaphysicians, and in our present argument it is chained. We are to deal with working concepts, or working hypotheses or categories, with the interpretation of "phenomena," and not with ultimate reality. It is here, precisely on this narrow ground, that we have to consider whether or no the same working hypotheses or categories will avail us both in physical and in biological science, and all metaphysical speculation is out of bounds. And yet, after all, we must not too hastily exclude Reality from our scope, as we have dismissed vitalism; for our lion is brought upon the stage, he has a speaking part in the play, and " let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws." The concept of Reality is not something wholly outside of our phenomena, but they themselves are part, though it may be a small part, of it; and all our group of sciences, physical, chemical, and biological, strive to interpret those " bits of reality" which are within their reach and appropriate to their categories. Pure physics, essentially quantitative, deals with such concepts, or such aspects of matter, as extension and mass; chemistry, essentially qualitative, deals with matter analysed and distinguished according to its kind. Chemistry, therefore, makes a nearer approach to, or seems to give a somewhat closer insight into, reality than physics does; they are successive approximations to reality. The physical hypotheses are intended to deal with very general characters of reality, and they have the abstract form and character appropriate to that purpose. Chemical hypo- theses and certain of those of applied physics apply to things, to c</page><page sequence="24">34 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. kinds of matter or forms of energy and modes of force, which are regarded as specific ; and, hence, they are necessarily less abstract and less general, more direct and more specific. It is obvious that biology, when we include under it all the phenomena attendant upon or associated with life, goes further still. But our particular question is, whether biology regarded under certain definite limitations, to wit, a biology apart from the manifestations of consciousness, need necessarily involve a higher range of categories, incommensurate with mechanism. And so, while metaphysical speculation is undoubtedly out of bounds for the time being, I am prepared to agree that in a fuller treatment of the theme the nature of reality might be found to be at the bottom of the whole case; and especially if it be conceded that reality is a something which can be dealt with piece-meal, and whose "pieces" or several aspects can be analysed into grades. But now let me come at last to discuss, with all possible brevity, Dr. Haldane's attitude to the " mechanistic hypothesis." He gives us, by the way, so slight an inkling for the moment of his own "biologioal hypothesis," that I find little to say about it in the way of Yea or Nay. The main question is, Is it required at all ? To begin with, I am inclined to demur to Dr. Haldane's general treatment of the " mechanistic theory." He talks about the "easy-going mechanistic explanations, which became current during the latter half of last century." There may be some ground here and there for the aspersion; but the phrase sounds to me prejudicial, Rough and ready indeed seem to us the first mechanistic theories of Descartes; but even they were not "easy-going. Generations of "mechanistic" physiologists have tried, by no easy road, to use, as Dr. Haldane himself has done, every stepping-stone that advancing physics and advanc- ing ohemistry supply towards an elucidation of the bodily mechanism, Where is it, precisely, that they have failed ? And</page><page sequence="25">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 35 where is it (I do not know) that an alternative method has yet succeeded better? Upon my word, Dr. Haldane gives us no clear and sharp answer to either question. He tells us, on the one hand, that it is natural to seek for "a mechanical explana- tion of the contraction of muscle, and though definite progress in this direction has hitherto been limited, I feel confident that we are on the eve of such progress." " Good," one is apt to say, "he is evidently sound in his appreciation of the efforts of the orthodox physiologist." Yet, on the next page one reads, " on the whole, there is no evidence of real progress towards a mechanistic explanation of life." It may be that the apparent contradiction is removed by the last two little words, and that Dr. Haldane would welcome a mechanistic explanation of isolated phenomena, though he does not recognise, or countenance, or even anticipate, its possible extension to the whole. But we have already seen that we have nothing to do with "the whole," for not only the great metaphysical concepts but also the great problems of psychology are ruled out; and, surely, the contraction of a muscle is a fair sample of the unconscious and non-psychological problems of physiology. If we can progress, and progress continually, in our bio- logical studies towards a physico-chemical explanation of such phenomena, can we reasonably say that the categories of these physical sciences are alien to or irreducible with our own? And as for " easy-going explanations," I venture to think that the " easy-going" attitude is on the part of those who, when they come to a perplexing and entangled problem, one (for instance) where chemistry and physics are manifestly con- cerned, and when their knowledge of these subjects does not suffice to solve it, would too readily abandon the ship, and pray to the dcus ex machina of a new philosophy. And lastly, for that matter, the phrase would seem to suggest that the physicist himself deals with "easy-going mechanical explanations." Now, not only do I think that this is not the case, but it seems to me that a study of some c2</page><page sequence="26">36 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. of the commonest and homeliest of natural phenomena would teach us that it is by no means so. In many cases the mechanism involved is yet unknown; in others it has been only recently elucidated; in all it is and has been the subject of anxious care and hard thinking. The formation of dew, of mist and fog, of rain itself, are all instances which come quickly to my mind, and satisfy me in my contention that easy-going mechanical hypotheses will never do, will never last long, but give place in due time to infinitely more refined explanations, without, however, ever leaving the old level of concepts, the established class of physical categories. Dr. Haldane's chief illustration is drawn from the phenomena of respiration, a part of physiology where he is peculiarly at home. He tells us that here, for instance, we have a series of phenomena quite insusceptible of the simple mechanical explanations which were formerly given of them. I do not wonder: the same is true, word for word, of a multitude of phenomena in ordinary physics and ordinary chemistry; is not ' solution," for instance, a very different thing to the modern chemist from what it was much less than fifty years ago ? Fifty years ago many physiological processes which, from a physical and chemical standpoint, are now seen to be extremely complex and even obscure, were regarded as quite simple. Again, word for word, this is true of chemistry and of physics; for instance, the whole of modern physical chemistry goes to show how inadequate were the loose non-mathematical ideas of a previous generation of chemists. Dr. Haldane's crucial instance (or that which I take to be so) lies in the phenomenon of "regulation," whereby the passage of oxygen through the living membrane of the lung is increased when the needs of the organism become greater; "wherever there is need for an extra supply of oxygen, as for instance, during muscular exertion, the membrane assumes an active rdle, and pushes oxygen inwards without regard to the mechanical laws of diffusion." I am shy of entertaining, and</page><page sequence="27">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 37 shyer still of expressing, a doubt regarding Dr. Haldane's physiology. But I do venture to think that, in our admittedly incomplete knowledge of the phenomenon, this statement seems a trifle too specific. More oxygen undoubtedly goes through, but are we certain that it is pushed through, rather than pulled? And in any case, if it be pushed to the one side, it must surely be first pulled from the other. I fail to see that we are here transcending the powers of mechanism. Many a machine is constructed to oil itself the more copiously when it works the faster, and the printing- press, as we urge it to put out more newspapers on the one side, pulls in more blank paper on the other. These illustra- tions are crude, admittedly, as are all instances drawn from machines constructed by the hands and designed by the mind of man. But in nature herself, if we look at her larger handiwork, self-regulation and self-maintenance become para- mount attributes and characteristics of her machines. The solar system, qua mechanism, is the perfect specimen, the very type and norm, of a self-maintaining, self-regulating mechanism; and so also, grade after grade, are its dependent mechanisms, such as the world-wide currents of the atmosphere and of the sea. Let me try to choose with greater care a case which shall illustrate the temporary inadequacy of a mechanical explanation, and the successful mastery of the problem by the elaboration of new hypotheses, or the discovery of new " laws." The phenomenon of "sedimentation," by which sand and mud settle to the bottom of the sea, is at first sight one of the simplest of mechanical phenomena. The particles gravitate to the bottom, by virtue of their greater density; while doing so and after doing so they are disturbed by currents and other motions of the fluid; the small and light ones are carried on, the large and heavy are left behind; the finest particles settle down at last in the calm centre of an eddy or at the termination</page><page sequence="28">38 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. of the stream. It is by dint of this explanation, so far as it goes, that we may map out roughly the currents of a shallow sea by charting the distribution of the muds, sands and gravels on its floor. But it is found that this is by no means the whole story, and that it fails in the light of a closer study of the experimental facts. It is a "working hypothesis" which, by itself, will not do. And now Dr. Joly has shown that the phenomenon is far more complex than we had thought; that it is qualitative as well as quantitative; that chemistry is involved; that complicated surface-actions have to be considered, and that ionisation enters the field. Apart from ordinary chemical action, decomposition or disintegration of any kind, the little particles will be influenced in their fall by the " valency " of the chemical salts dissolved in the surrounding fluid; and they will fall at very different rates in solutions of equal density, but of different kinds. And the new hypotheses are, for the present at least, adequate to the case; they bring our experi- ments into harmony, and enable us to foresee their results. It is just another illustration of the fact that science not only " flows," like everything else, but flows in waves. A sub.ject is obscure to-day, when we know little of it; it is easy to-morrow, when we have learned more; but we have only to wait awhile and learn yet more, and we feel ignorant again. I lay stress upon this illustration. I think it safe and fair to assert that it is very much on all fours with Dr. Haldane's case. A certain physical explanation of a physical phenomenon is found to be inadequate; a mechanical explanation, simple and for a long while acceptable to all, is no longer satisfying. But a wise man finds a certain key at his girdle, a new key of the old bunch, and unlocks the gate, and pursues his journey. I draw the simple lesson that, when a closed gate confronts us in our way, we had better wait and search for a key, and that we should be very loath indeed to forsake the pathway for the open fields.</page><page sequence="29">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 39 But a very curious thing to me is that, while Dr. Haldane shows so great a readiness to break away from the old road, to abandon the old working hypotheses, and to devise new categories for the biologist, yet at times he seems to say precisely what I would have him say, and to accept just the lesson, or at least a part of the lesson, which I think the foregoing illustration is fitted to teach. For; on p. 25, he says that, when Faraday pointed out the existence of ions ib solutions, he made a discovery which has gradually exercised a more and more widespread influence on scientific and practical activity, and has at the same time given a new significance to previous discoveries. Precisely so and who is he that should set bounds to such an influence, or who should despair of other such discoveries ? They give, indeed, a new significance to our old knowledge, but they do not depart one bit from the old pathway; they refine and improve the old categories; they create new ones perhaps, but these new 'ones are of the same nature and are commensurate with the old; the general and fundamental working hypothesis is unchanged, save that it is better spelled, and is somehow found to be more convincing and satisfactory than before. Dr. Haldane lays stress upon several points which he asserts to stand in open contradiction to our concept of a mechanism. He says, for instance, that "a living organism differs in this respect from any mechanism which we can construct or conceive, that it forms itself, and keeps itself in working order and activity." We might, I think, show not un-usefully that many a machine improves, up to a certain point, as it goes along. The ship finds herself, as Kipling says. My typewriter works more easily and writes better than when it was brand-new i bearings work easier, springs are slightly and advantageously relaxed, the thing is decidedly in better "working order." A spade sharpens itself as we dig with it, as " iron sharpeneth iron." All this is very true "up to a certain point," and surely of the body the same restriction</page><page sequence="30">40 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. holds. It is, alas, not true at all that the body "keeps itself in working order and activity." I am old enough to be assured of the contrary. Like all other machines, the bodily machine grows old, and wears out, and works itself done. Again, Dr. Haldane tells us (for example) that "the existence of a self-producing or self-maintaining mechanism" is something to which no meaning can be attached, for the idea of "a mechanism which is constantly maintaining or reproducing its own structure is self-contradictory," and this is all expanded into the assertion that "a mechanism which reproduced itself would be a machine without parts, and therefore not a mechanism "; and, again, that " in each detail of organic structure, composition, environment and activity there is an expression of the life of the organism regarded as a whole which tends to persist." The parent organism is, indeed, "reproduced from a mere tiny speck of its own body," but that tiny speck does not stand alone, to live of itself, to work out its own destiny, and to make or to maintain itself. When the parent tissues have ceased to nourish it, it is not left alone. All the forces of nature impinge and react upon it; together they nourish it; they mould and conform it; the sun shines upon it; the air bathes it; it is a mechanism, but only part of a greater mechanism, and the mechanism of which it is a portion is the world. The fact is, that the whole argument, as Dr. Haldane puts it, together with a few of the other points by which he strives to show the inadequacy of mechanical explanations, is not a very novel one; I seem to have read the same thing, or just the same sort of thing, in Driesch, and in Bergson too, and in the books of many other of those who shrink from mechanism, and introduce those very concepts of vitalism, those more or less shadowy entelechies, which Dr. Haldane for his part rejects and repudiates. The alleged phenomena of self-production, self-maintenance, and self-regulation are the common currency of those who, finding the mechanistic theory</page><page sequence="31">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 41 difficult and unsatisfactory, are content to postulate a something "which interferes with and guides the physical and chemical reactions." After specifying many important points wherein the growth of the organism is comparable to that of a crystal, Dr. Haldane tells us that " where the resemblance fails is that the arrange- ment of the molecules of the crystal is mere repetition, whereas in the organism there is individual variety of detail, and yet perfectly definite and specific unity of plan." Let me take another illustration, crude perhaps, but not cruder than that of the crystal. Imagine a bowl of soap-suds, into which you blow. The simple mechanism consists, appa- rently, of a bowl of water and a stream of air; in truth it is more complicated than that, but it is exquisitely simple after all. But whether or no, in a few moments it develops into a very wonderful thing-a mass of froth, a shapely heap of very beautiful bubbles. The resultant whole is a very elaborate and a very perfect thing; and in no single bubble of it all is there a single free surface, or point or line or surface of contact, which is not absolutely definite, and (what is more) which our present knowledge cannot satisfactorily explain. There is "perfectly definite and specific unity of plan." Moreover, there is almost infinite "individual variety of detail "; for no two bubbles are precisely the same, and repeat the experiment, and no single bubble in the first corresponds individually to a single bubble in the second. Pour a little of the water into another dish, and the whole complex structure will reproduce itself-or rather it can be made to reproduce itself. For again we must blow; the forces are not inherent in the soapy water (any more than the forces of growth and reproduction are all inherent in the protoplasm); the system is a larger system-it is a portion of the world. Let me say before I leave Dr. Haldane's paper, and say in perfectly frank and candid words, that I find him difficult to</page><page sequence="32">42 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON&amp; understand, and that for this I am not inclined to shoulder all the blame. I find it hard to reach a clear definition of all his terms, and hard even, in some cases, to follow the thread of his argument. I shall be disappointed, but I shall not be wholly surprised, if he tell me that I have failed to follow him and that he and I are talking about different things. Let me try once more to reach his standpoint, and, if possible, to meet his argument. One of my chief difficulties arises, I think, from the ftct that, on the one hand, Dr. Haldane talks of a distinction between "physical" and "biological " categories, as though this were, by the nature of things, the one place in which to look for a sharp distinction, One is hereby invited, to all appearance, to interpret "physical" by physico-cheinical or even "inorganic" science, and to draw our one and only essential contrast (in this pottion of our subject) between the study of the living and the study of the dead. But, on the other hand, Dr. Haldane recurs again and again to the special department of chemistry, he draws some of his chief illustrations from it, and it is plain that he recognises to the full the undoubted fact that its categories ihclude much more than is contained in the working hypotheses of ordinary physics. In short, there is a gap between the eategories of physics and of chemistry, what- ever there may be or may not be between these sciences and biology. Yet, while there is a categorical difference between our present-day physics and chemistry, it may be admitted that this difference is not of the first order of magnitude; it is even a possible and a plausible anticipation to look forward to a day when this breach of categories may be removed, for not a little has already been doine to narrow it. At present, the " working hypotheses " of chemistry and physics are manifestly different, and " for practical purposes" they will always, in all probability, remain so. Were, however, the transmutation of the well-known elements to become an accomplished experimental fact, were we to succeed at last in reducing the qualitative</page><page sequence="33">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 43 differences of chemistry to differences in the number and arrangement of qualitatively similar elements (such as electrons), and to find them obeying a single set of rules, then the distinction would have disappeared, and we should have in truth reduced the categories of chemistry to the "simpler categories " of physics. Dr. Haldane must be fully awake to the possibility; I take it, therefore, that he does recognise the narrowness of the gulf between these two sciences, and that it is a much wider gulf which he sees between them both and the science of organisms-even of the " non-conscious " organism. Still, he does not tell us as clearly as one would like how he recognises it, or of what nature he believes it to be, Nor does Dr. Haldane define what he really means by the "working hypotheses or categories of biology," and I remain in some doubt as to what they precisely are. That they are very ill-defined in general is pretty obvious to me; and it is precisely to Dr. Haldane, and it is just for the purposes of such a discussion as this, that we might look for a new and clear expression of thenm. For the " ordinary naturalist," the ordinary student of beast and bird; specific difference, if not all in all, is the cardinal concept; for all he cares, for all he sometimes knows, the tissue and the cell are concepts which might never have been devised. The comparative anatomist or the morpho- logist deals with larger units, and cares little about the difference between a blackbird and a thrush, a robin and a wren. The physiologist deals with still larger groups; the cell and the tissue are his especial themes, and most (though of course not all) of the lessons which he learns are lessons common to and taught by the study of a very few " types," such as man, the rabbit, and the frog. The working hypotheses of (say) the ornithologist are certainly hot mechanical, they are very largely teleological; the ordinary working hypotheses of the physio- logist are, in the great majority of cases, distinctly mechanical, and include and practically coincide with those of the physicist and the chemist.</page><page sequence="34">44 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. And here we may at least note in passing that there is one common concept or working hypothesis of the biologist, which occupies a very peculiar position; it is the working hypothesis of heredity, regarded as a definite impulse, or "force," leading to hereditary transmission. It is an everyday statement of the morphologist that this or that structure, often apparently functionless, is "due to heredity "; it is prefigured as a kind of "Mneme "; it is (commonly at least) a purely vitalistic hypothesis. I for my part look forward, in faith and hope, to the ultimate reduction of the phenomena of heredity to much simpler categories, to explanations based on mechanical lines, and on the peculiar and strict limitations which physical and mathematical laws set to what are at first sight the endless and unlimited possibilities of variation. Yet this is but an opinion, and it may be maintained by others that heredity is an independent concept, sui generis, indispensable to the biologist; that it is a phenomenon, or group of phenomena, within a category all its own; and that the special science which deals with it has at least found, in Mendel, its Kepler, and only waits for its Newton. I take it that it is in the main of biology as it is considered, or as it ought to be regarded, by the physiologist that Dr. Haldane speaks, not forgetting those formal, or morpho- logical, or histological, and of course also embryological, problems of the tissues and of the cell with which the physiologist's work is interconnected. It must be largely for his own use and guidance as a physiologist that Dr. Haldane seeks for a definition of the biological category or categories, and it is from his own experience as a physiologist that he maintains them to be irreducible to the physical. I hope to learn from this discussion, but I do not yet easily or fully comprehend, precisely where he stands. I can understand clearly enough a cardinal distinction between the categories of teleology and of mechanical causation;</page><page sequence="35">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 45 though even here there are not lacking certain risks of confusion, as in the case, for instance, of the man-made machine. But I do not think somehow that this cardinal distinction, between a final and an efficient cause, is what Dr. Haldane asserts to lie between the phenomena of the living and of the dead; it would be so easy to say so if it were !* Moreover, in one or two places, Dr. Haldane seems actually to reject it, as, for instance, where he not only denies that the phenomena of the reproducing germ are such "as if it were realising a conscious plan of the fully developed organism,"-a theory which, by the way, or something extremely like it, certain embryologists have actually upheld,- but, on the contrary, tells us that "embryological investigation indicates that each step in development is the outcome of the conditions existing at the moment." Here surely is the "efficient cause," and the description looks very like a "mechanical " one to me. I am led, then, to suppose that Dr. Haldane demands for the living organism, or for "living matter," some difference, as compared with dead matter, which endows it with wholly novel properties and capacities, now limited by, but anon transcending, the physictll conditions, and conferring peculiar potentialities, such as those of self-regulation and the rest. If this be so, new categories are indeed required; but in what sense, or why, are we to look upon them as permanently and necessarily irreducible to those of physical science ? If they be irreducible, they are (for the time being) mysteries;t our current theories and explanations crumble and vanish * Dr. Hobhouse faces this cardinal distinction, boldly raises an hypothesis upon it, and expresses the same in the plainest of words. " We now suggest," he says, " that the organic system is in a general sense purposive, i.e., at least conational, becoming purposive in its higher removes. The purposive and the mechanical, on the other hand, remain fundamentally distinct categories." t And mysteries they emphatically would be, if attached to or intrinsic in them were the least tinge of conation, such as Dr. Hobhouse suggests.</page><page sequence="36">46 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. away; and we need another Archimedes, another Galileo, another Newton, to discover the elementary laws, and to write the Principia, of biology. But even were these new categories necessary in the present, in order to avoid confusion and error and to amend our rationes cogitandi, it woull still have to be proved that they were something more than a mere present help, and that they were for ever irreducible to the categories of physics. And such categories may not be " mechanical " in the ordinary sense, but may yet be mechanical in an extended sense. For mechanism is not a stationary concept but a growing one. What it meant to Aristotle is not what it means to us. Chemistry has opened our eyes, and electricity (for instance) has strained them to keep the nature and significance of a " mechanism " in view. And that IDr. Haldane recognises a "'continuum " in the grades of mechanism, a succession of advancing categories, is indicated to my mind by a certain paragraph which at first sight perplexed me mightily. On page 18 he says, " From no elementary mechanical principles can we deduce the behaviour of even the molecule of water in crystallisation; and similarly, from no elementary physical or chemical principles can we deduce the behaviour of the organism. It is owing to this empirical fact that the ordinary working hypotheses of physics and chemistry are irreconcilable with those of biology." I do not quite follow the statement about the behaviour of the molecule in crystallisation. I should have thought that the labours of the mathematical crystailographers, all they have taught us about the partitioning of space, the methods of close-packing, the large but strictly limited range of possible crystalline forms, etc., all the labours, in short, of Kelvin, Fedorow, Schoenfliess, Tutton, the Braggs and others, had vastly increased our knowledge, and helped our deductions, as to the behaviour of the molecule of water in crystallisation. Whether or no,</page><page sequence="37">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 47 it is certainly more than a matter of elementary mechanies, but it is reconcilable with the most general and fundamental principles which the physicist and the mathematician lay down. Can it be that Dr. Haldane is here only emphasising the poverty of our elementary mechanical principles, and of the ordinary working hypotheses of physics and chemistry, and again of the ordinary working hypotheses of biology ? If this be so, then, in this particular, he and I are not far apart. There is a principle of "economy," doubtless, in science, as I am told there is even in theology; there are exoteric and esoteric doctrines even in the concrete sciences, there are categories sometimes to be considered and sometimes silently passed by-as every teacher of elementary students knows. The simpler setting consists of those "schematised conceptions" of which Dr. Haldane speaks, and which are '"practically sufficient for a large number of purposes." But behind these lie many more recondite concepts and hypotheses; and on these the working chemist or physicist knows that he can draw at need, without fear or risk of outstepping the funda- mental categories of physical science. And now to summarise my own position, so far as in a few words I can. I believe that the material body of a living thing (apart from consciousness) is a mechanism. I see no other way of investigating in detail its material struoture, its form and its activities. I know no way of studying its material aspect otherwise than by the help of physical and chemical methods, and of the mathematical laws on which these sciences rest in their turn. I set out provided with the physical concepts of matter and of energy, and the mathematical concept of force. I know that change of form in a concrete material body involves the movements of matter, and that the movements of matter are to be symbolically ascribed to the action of force, and actually to the transference of energy. The body consists</page><page sequence="38">48 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. of matter; it is set in a material world; it has its store of energy within, it has its share in the great store of energy without. It is a part of -a physical system; I study it, as well as its environment, according to the working hypotheses, or categories, of physical science, with all my might and without either hesitation or fear. It is its physical or material phenomena, admittedly, that I am studying. What more, outside of psychology and outside of metaphysics, can I do ? There is one thing more that strengthens in a high degree my belief in the applicability of physical methods to the organism and in the community of principles in the two classes of machines. And that is the simple but most instructive fact that, while the biologist has been trying to learn of the physicist, the physicist has also found his own science vastly enriched through the labours of the physiologist and by a study of the phenomena of the living body. That identical phe- nomenon of osmosis, which Dr. Haldane finds so difficult to understand as it is exemplified in the human body, was actually introduced (under its modern aspect) to the physicist by a botanist, who drew the lesson from his plants. And no small number of corollaries, experinmental and theoretical, to Pfeffer's original discoveries have found their way into the sciences of physics and chemistry from the same biological starting-point. Furthermore, we all know that one at least of the great men for whom is claimed the first enunciation of the principle of the conservation of energy was a physiologist, who had learned his physics from the study of the physiological machine; and I am inclined to think that to that great physiological physicist the judgment of history is more and more freely ascribing the credit of this epoch-making discovery. I think the fact of the obvious benefit to both sides of the interchange of ideas, this reaction and interaction between mechanical physiology and ordinary physics, one with another, goes far to convince us that the processes are fundamentally identical, and that the</page><page sequence="39">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 49 mechanical hypothesis is not applied to the organism falsely or in vain. Again, choosing rather the morphological side than the physiological side of the common field of biology, I would illustrate my own position by such few facts as these: When I regard the minute and simple organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, I see among their multitudinous forms a large number which are easily described and classified in physical terms. They consist, for the most part, of tiny spheres, of tiny cylinders, and these latter are capped by portions of tiny spheres; others again are, so to speak, wavy or beaded cylinders-we call them "unduloids,"-and others, closely related to these, are shortened unduloids with spherical bases, exactly like the Florence flask that a glass-blower so easily blows. In short, every one of these figures is most easily reproduced by the glass-blower, and for the simple reason that, like his molten glass, they have assumed the known and well-under- stood configurations of a fluid film, or fluid surface, according to the simple mathematical conception of "surfaces of minimal area," under this or that simple condition of restraint. The words which describe, or the so-called " laws which govern," a soap-bubble describe and "govern" them. Precisely analogous principles evidently extend, the general law of sur- faces of minimal area evidently applies, to other less simple but equally minute organic configurations, including spirals or helicoids of various kinds. Without the mathematical or physical concept I am lost or mystified in considering them, and in classifying this mazy congeries of forms; by the help of it, my observations are co-ordinated and my facts "explained." And, mark you, this "explanation" is not a mere matter of nomenclature, a mere symbolic terminology, or juggling with words. It presupposes a definite acquaintance with somewhat abstruse laws of statics, and the definite assertion that the precise conditions under which the results and consequences of D</page><page sequence="40">50 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. these laws are displayed are common to the living and to the dead. And if it be only in the minuter living things and minute parts of living things that they are openly displayed, a simple and adequate reason is at hand. For it is only in them, by reason of their little mass and relatively extensive surface, that the force of gravity is overwhelmed by the molecular forces imme- diately concerned. If there be a few such forms, and they are very few indeed, to which the same principles do not obviously apply, I wait in patient expectancy for more light, but I do not hurry to exchange my old lantern for a new. Let us take a little multicellular organism, and let us by no means be ashamed to choose a simple one; for it is an essential part of the method of physical science, and of mathematics itself, to deal with simple, even simplified, cases, and thereby to avoid a confusion of issues, a conflict of causes. How does the first cell divide ? In what way, or under what sort of configurations, do its products of division divide again ? Generations of microscopists have depicted and described the configurations of the subdividing cell without ever dreaming that they were aught else than a specific biological phe- nomenon. But Berthold and Errera and others have shown, or helped to show, that they are, point for point, line for line, and surface for surface, capable of interpretation by the same mathematico-physical principles-that they are neither more nor less than exquisite illustrations of fluid surfaces in complete or partial equilibrium. I can take an imaginary discoidal mass of liquid, represented by a circle, and inquire on purely mathematical principles how, were it to divide into drops or fragments and the fragments to remain in contact, the partitions between them, the cell-walls, would be arranged, and in what order of succession they would appear. The question is not a very easy one; it involves no little calcu- lation, and the result is more complicated than one might perhaps expect. Yet it is a literal fact that, when we have sought and found a little organism of just such a simple,</page><page sequence="41">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 51 flattened, discoid form, and when we have watched its first little cell divide and divide again, the resultant configuration, complicated as it is, and the successive stages in their orderly succession as they severally appear, agree in every essential particular with the scheme which our physico-mathematical principles had enabled us to foretell. Dr. Haldane has referred you to a book of his; may I say that I have written a book too ? And in it, from beginning to end, I have sought to show that the phenomena of Growth and of Form in organisms are phenomena to which the working hypotheses, or categories, of physico-mnathematical science strictly, and even adequately, apply. They are not the same physico-mathematical laws, by any means, that apply to and explain the crystal. But the difference between them is not a difference between physics and biology, between the living and the dead; it is merely the simpler difference, or series of differences, between the solid crystal and the drop of water, between the symmetry of a solid and the symmetry of a liquid drop or liquid film, between the condition of equilibrium (or minimum potential energy) in a growing system whose particles, as in the fluid drop, are mobile, and one whose particles, as in the growing crystal, fall one after another, and once for all, into their places, and are free to move no more. That is, in itself, a very important difference; it leads by simple steps to many very important results; it reminds us of several important things-among others that "this too, too solid flesh " of ours is not a solid at all, and that (apart from our teeth and our bones) even the contours of our own bodies are not those of solid bodies, but of elastic membranes or fluid films.* The material structure of our bodies, like those of all other organisms, is styled a fabric, and is regarded by many or most * In short, the analogy of the crystal is essentially illegitimate, and that of the froth is legitimate. D2</page><page sequence="42">52 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. students of biology as a mechanism. One may be, I hold, a consistent " mechanist " without being by any means a " mere materialist." I am neither afraid nor ashamed to uphold (to the great length that I have gone) a mechanical theory of the organism and its activities, or rather of its reactions with the outer world. I do not admit that in doing so we degrade our conceptions, or belittle our notions, of the organism. The mechanical concept is no base one at all. The earth itself and the sea, the earth with her slowly changing face, and the sea multitudinous with all its tides and currents and great and little waves, constitute a mechanism; the heavens themselves, the sun and moon and all the little stars, are a glorious mechanism. The whole material aspect of the universe is a mechanism; we know not how it has its being, but we know that it lives and moves obedient to everlasting laws; and the same Benedicdte Dominmnt is addressed to the Showers and Dew and to the Winds of God as to all that move in the waters and all that move in the air, and to all Beasts and Cattle, and unto the Children of Men. Yet a word, ere I am done, about the teleological side of our phenomena, or about our interpretation thereof. I am no friend to that aspect of teleology which professes (or presumes) to find an end or purpose in this structure, this action, or in that. It is but a petty " teleology," a poor philosophy, an unsafe attempt on the part of science, to seek to find a "final cause " in every isolated detail-in the shape of a leaf or the coloration of an egg-shell. But with this subject, and especially with some of the grosser exaggerations to which the method has led, I have dealt sufficiently in my book. As a heuristic method, that of the final cause was much in vogue in physics in the days of Euler and of Maupertuis, and in the hands even of Leibniz himself; it has been abandoned by the physicists long ago. I do not think it is to be commended in biology, and the old</page><page sequence="43">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 53 Baconian arguments are, to my mind, its proper condemnation still. It gives too often the easy answer to those who are only seeking after a sign. It is full of traps set for the unwary and baited for the credulous. It attracts us to the particular case, and blinds us to the general. It "angers me," like Hotspur, and I would argue with it (if I could) as Hotspur with Owen Glendower. Yet there is a higher and broader teleology, which is a vastly different thing. It is involved in our faith that the world itself is good, and that for good and not evil do the parts of its vast machinery act and interact among themselves, in ways of which we have often little understanding, and in things that we see as through a glass darkly-if at all. If we get one little glimpse of it better than another, I think it is again through mathematics. For there is a profound and lasting lesson (I have quoted it before) in what Colin Maclaurin said, after studying the cell of the bee, that "' whatsoever is most beautiful and regular is also found to be most useful and excellent." At least let us recognise, if we venture to apply ourselves to the teleological argument at all, that teleology never stands alone, but that the final and the efficient causes are combined, or to be construed, together. It is difficult to serve two masters, but it is also difficult in this case to under- stand that the Master is One. There is a certain castle among the famous castles of Touraine, and in it a great artist fashioned a staircase-a marvel, a very jewel of a stair. Round the central newel of the staircase wind side by side two separate stairs; the climber by the one stair sees nothing of those who pass or cross him on the other; there is no passage- way between-until you come out at the top. So is it, I suppose, with the teleological and the mechanical categories; and my path lies by way of these last. I know that there is another ladder towards reality, but I am contented with my own. I have been told that Galileo and Newton were at the building of it; and I am heartened by the sight of great names scribbled on the wall.</page><page sequence="44">54 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. But last, and last of all, let me repeat again that in the concepts of matter and of energy, whether quantitative or qualitative, the Whole is not enshrined, and that mechanism is but one aspect of the world. These are the proper categories of objective science, but they are no more; the physicist is, ipso facto, a mechanist, but he is not by implication a materialist; nor is the biologist of necessity a materialist, even though he may study nothing but mechanism in the material fabric and the bodily activities of the organism. It is not merely that in dust we had our first beginnings and that to dust we shall at last return. Our bodies are dust all the while, as is the grass that withers and the flower that fades; and the laws by which our bodies are governed are the laws by which earth and dust are ruled. To this same purport the greatest of the Schoolmen, the Angelic Doctor, spoke (in words which I set in the forefront of my book), telling us across seven hundred years, that, inasmuch as the material and corporeal forms of the body non excedant virtutein et ordinem et facultaterm principiorum agentium in natura, nulla videtur necessitas eorum originem in principia reducere altiora. And so also a greater than he spoke, saying Earth to earth, and dust to dust. But there is a something that is not dust at all, though as in all things else it is found therein; some- thing that is the Order of the Cosmos and the Beauty of the World; that lives in all things living, and dwells in the mind and soul of man; something not fulfilled in physics, which vivifies the dust and makes the dry bones live. You may call it what you please, but it is always the same. You may call it Entelechy, you may call it the Harmony of the World; you may call it the .lan vital, you may call it the Breath of Life. Or, you may call it, as it is called in the Story- book of Creation, and in the hearts of men,-you may call it the Spirit of God.</page><page sequence="45">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 55 SYMPOSIUM: ARE PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IRREDUCIBLE ? III.-By P. CHALMERS MITCHELL. THE question set for our symposium presents one aspect of an enduring dispute. Thore have been, are, and always will be, dispositions reluctant to picture a universe unsustained by creative wilL "Creative will" assumes many phases, philo- sophically indifferent. It may be presented as God or gods, entelechy, or vital spark, but is something beyond prediction or control, the subject of observation, not of experiment. Belief in it is an expression at once of man's humility and of man's pride; an admission of the limits of our intelligence, and a soothing exaltation of what is beyond our intelligence. There have been, are, and always will be, dispositions reluctant to picture a universe any part of which is not a possible subject of pre- diction, control and experiment. A part, continually increasing, of the universe has been subjected to prediction, control and experiment, and, although each accession of human power has revealed a wider horizon of the unknown, many reject the idea that the unknown is different in kind from the known. The assumptions necessary to the logical completion of either view are enormous and familiar. The second view is plainly hopeless; inasmuch as success in the intensive or extensive investigation of any bit of nature always discovers new difficulties, always extends rather than contracts the problem, the naturalist, for so, as a matter of temporary convenience, I may call him, is a ready prey for the gibing supernaturalist. His carrot dangles from a pole fixed to his own forehead, and like the donkey in the story, however fast he may run, he never reaches his objective. But the supernaturalist is in little better case; he has a craving for the incarnation of his principle, observing it in</page><page sequence="46">56 P. CHALMERS MITCHELL. time and place, now in the plains of India, now in Galilee, now in the secreting epithelium of the lungs, and in due course, to the great content of the naturalist, bumps up against the evidence. I believe that the naturalist and the supernaturalist are the exhibitors of two dispositions, and that there is as little chance of coming to a just decision between them, did an impartial judge exist, as there would be in the cases of the agorophobic eel, which, when disturbed, dashes into a drain-pipe, and the claustrophobic mackerel which dashes into the open. The wording of the problem I am invited to discuss forms a trap for the unwary, and, indeed, might have been designed to land even so small a philosophical fish as myself, and to show how a naturalist, gasping out his life in the rare metaphysical medium, assumes the hues of the supernaturalist. Let me restate the problem in terms that are more familiar to me. It becomes threefold. Is it possible, with our present knowledge, to explain or state the observed phenomena of mind in terms of tihe observed phenomena of anatomy and physiology, and the observed phenomena of biology in terms of those of physics ? If it be not possible at present, is the trend of science towards such a set of syntheses? Do our observations discover differences in kind justifying the assertion that the syntheses are impossible? To the first phase of the problem an answer can be given with assurance. At present, mind cannot be interpreted or stated in terms of anatomy and physiology, nor biology in terms of physics and chemistry. Let me insist, however, on the crude fact that mind cannot be interpreted without anatomy and physiology, nor life without chemistry and physics. We can make no observations on any mind or on any mental phenomenon isolated from and independent of structure and physiological function. Even God always speaks through His prophets. Logic and imagination clarify thought, but so also do cascara and bismuth. I cannot explain the reactions of protoplasm by</page><page sequence="47">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 57 the properties of solutions and the qualities of chemical elements, but I cannot observe them apart from these properties and qualities. It is a commonplace of polemics that life escapes under the scalpel, that the protoplasm which the chemist analyses is dead. True; yet not only life, but blood escapes under the scalpel, and the protoplasm in dying has changed its chemical reaction. To the second phase of the problem, the trend of science, it is difficult to give an answer uncoloured by disposition. For the answer must be interpretation, not mere observation. Some forty years ago, the categories of science were clear-cut and glittering abstractions; in physics what Dr. Haldane calls "mechanism" reigned; in biology function was believed to depend on structure; in psychology, instinct, intelligence, and emotion were thought, to be independent of one another and of structure and function. None the less, there were confident naturalists who believed that biology could be explained in terms of mechanism, and psychology in terms of a function- structure complex. And even within the limits of these categories, progress was made towards synthesis. I need recall only illustrative examples. Many organic compounds have been made in the laboratory from inorganic materials; the attempt to evade this breaking down of the barrier between organic and inorganic by the suggestion that vital action was still involved, to wit, the vital action of the chemist in the laboratory, is only silly, for water is equally inorganic whether it be found in nature or synthesised in a laboratory. Many of the observed phenomena of living protoplasm have been copied by artificial non-living preparations. The fertilisation of the egg-cell, which seemed a supreme case of the action of life upon life, has been achieved by the action of an inorganic salt on the ovum. The direct dependence of psychological differences on differences in structure has been demonstrated at least in pathological cases, and indicated in comparative anatomy.</page><page sequence="48">58 P. CHALMERS MITCHELL. These are notable achievements; end, if the categories of science had remained unchanged, I should claim that an advance had been made in the direction of naturalistic monism,-an advance which had given the naturalists a sure entrance into forts that supernaturalists had asserted to be impregnable. But the categories have shifted, and the advance of knowledge has opened up new vistas of the unknown. I agree with Dr. Haldane that what he calls mechanism no longer satisfies the chemist and the physicist. I will go further, and say that we have learned to see, or to think that we see, function deter- mining structure in biology, and, perhaps, even the mind creating its own organs in psychology. Yet, I do not share his apparent triumph. If what we call matter be energy that waxes and wanes, if we have to deal with ions rather than with molecules, if the material fabric of the universe be alert rather than inert, then the categories of physics and chemistry are moving towards the categories of biology. If we have to think of function as determining structure, then our conception of the process of evolution shifts from the hard conception of the origin of adaptations by selection of chance variation, shifts from it nearer to our observation of the triumphant ascent of life. And precisely as the categories of physics and of biology have become less mechanical, they seem to me to approach, not to recede from, the categories of psychology. In another respect I agree with Dr. Haldane's presentment of his case, but dispute the conclusion towards which he seems to proceed. I agree that organic chemistry must be observed as chemistry of an organism rather than as chemistry in an organism. The subject of observation is a living organism, its parts in relation to the whole, acting as parts of the whole, the whole dominating and determining the parts. And so, in psychology, what is being observed is this or the other mental quality of a living body, the living body in reaction with a living and a non-living environment. We can, in a sense, study the inorganic isolated from the organic; we cannot study the</page><page sequence="49">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 59 organic isolated from the inorganic. We can, in a sense, study the organic isolated from psychology, but not psychology isolated from the organic and the inorganic. In such a sense the working categories of physics, biology, and psychology, are different in kind. The properties of 1, 2, and 6, may, for con- venience, be studied independently, and 1 can be studied without considering 2, and 2 without considering 6, but we cannot go far with 2 unless we realise that it is two ones, or with 6 unless we realise that it is six ones. I am disposed to believe that the properties of 1 must explain those of 2 and of 6, although in the case of 6 an apparently new factor, 3, has appeared. But I do not suppose that if we had only ones we could infer twos, or only ones and twos that we could infer three and sixes. Even within what Dr. Haldane would agree to be mechanism, an apparent difference of categories is a matter of observation. It is convenient and necessary to observe watches and motor cars as wholes, and not as compounds of wheels and levers composed of metals and oils. The machine has qualities of its own, modes of influencing its parts and being influenced by them, which no doubt depend on the properties and qualities of the parts and constituents, but which in practice cannot be inferred from them. Two machines, built by the same mechanics from standardised parts to the same specification, behave differently as wholes, get different work out of their parts, react and adjust themselves differently. In a very practical sense there is a deus ex machint, and His level in the celestial hierarchy is inversely as the knowledge of the observer. These are commonplaces, and yet watches and motor cars are designed on strictly mechanistic principles. The simplest living organism is more complex than the most elaborate machine, and in every detail of its structure avoids the rigidity of mechanism. Clearly, it must be studied as an organism and not as a compound of certain chemical and physical pro- perties. But this apparent difference in categories is certainly</page><page sequence="50">60 P. CHALMERS MITCHELL. an empirical convenience, and far from certainly a philosophical distinction. I must suppose it to be possible that if a human mind could retain and combine all the independent variables in a motor car, he would dethrone the god from the machine, and predict the conduct of the whole from knowledge of its parts without testing it practically. Yet, we take the easy, probably the inevitable way, even in the case of machinery, and observe. In biology, and still more in psychology, the easy way is the inevitable way. Unabashed, therefore, by Dr. Haldane's facts, which I am not concerned to dispute, I follow my disposition, and declare that the trend of science is towards synthesis of the categories. There remains the last phase of the problem. I can see no ground for the tremendous assumption that the categories of physics, biology, and psychology are irreducible, if by the phrase more is meant than that it is convenient to observe the phenomena independently, in so far as independence is possible, and that, therefore, we can go a long way in observation whilst using different working hypotheses, laws, or generalisations for the three subjects. But in my own picture of the universe, the problem as set for us has only a dubious relation to reality. By reality I mean what can be explored but not exhausted, the bottomless well of surprises, that which appears to be outside us and from which the new is always coming into us. Our categories are arranged abstractions of what has come into us, simplified and codified in our endeavour to recreate the external world. In observation of the secreting epithelium of the lung we are nearer reality than in the physiologist's description and explanation of what he has observed; and the physiologist qua physiologist is nearer reality than when, as metaphysician, he abstracts his physiological abstractions. Lord Morley once described the universe as a "sovereign wonder of superhuman fixedness of law." In my picture of the world, man, and not the superhuman, is the maker of laws, categories or what it may please us to call our abstractions. He achieves fixedness only</page><page sequence="51">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 61. inasmuch as he departs from reality. If observation were to cease, I do not doubt but that we should come to achieve a synthesis of our categories, a logically complete and completely anthropomorphic unity. I admit that the effort towards a logical and coherent arrangement of categories is an exciting pursuit. It is, however, the manufacture and worship of a graven image, and the temple of reality is a house not built with human hands. If the real goal be to answer the question, Are matter, life and mind different aspects of the same reality ? then I am more encouraged by observation than by thought. The detection of the same element in a distant star and in the fabric of the brain, the analogies between the effect of a cylinder of oxygen on a dull flame, a torpid muscle and a dying mind, lead my imagination further towards a conception of the unity of reality than the subtlest rearrangement of categories. And I have a closer vision of the realness of reality given me by the surprises of matter than by the syntheses of thoughts. Perhaps, it is as well to add that. I do not forget that matter is a thought of the individual as much as is a category. Yet, there are thoughts that are of the earth earthy, and thoughts that are of categories categorical. All the wonder and the hope and the new knowledge are in the earthy thoughts; all the failure and the despair in the metaphysical thoughts.</page><page sequence="52">62 L. T. HOBHOUSE. SYMPOSIUM: ARE PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IRREDUCIBLE? IV -By L. T. HOBHOUSE. THE living body in general, and the human body in particular, obviously acts in some respects like a mechanism, while in other respects it appears to act differently. About the differences two questions mnay be raised. First, taking them at their face value, are they all of one kind, reducible to one formula, or of two or more kinds, such as the organic and the teleological ? Secondly, are they to be taken at their face value, or are they to be regarded as mere appearances due to some subtle complexities of mechanism not yet adequately laid bare ? To answer these questions we must seek first a definition of the mechanical, the organic, and the teleological. We must, then, look at the actual behaviour of living beings, and ask to which of these they conform. The term mechanism seems to have established itself in philosophy as antithetic to the term teleology. It is an odd usage, since a machine is as clearly something contrived with a purpose as anything can be. But perhaps it is the contrast between the purpose which contrived the machine and the blindness with which it acts that has given the term its currency. Be that as it may, the characteristics of mechanism can be seen in a man-made machine, if we look at the details of its action, readily enough, and they are these. In a machine, though all the parts are so compacted as normally to act in relation with one another so as to produce a certain joint result, yet each several part acts uniformly without relation to the rest in response to the forces operating upon it, whatever they may be. The chain of the bicycle is pulled by the teeth</page><page sequence="53">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 63 of one wheel and pulls the teeth of the other wheel. Normally, in its complete fitting, this serves to propel the bicycle, but if either wheel is in some way out of gear it makes no difference to the chain. Pull it by hand, and the pull will be propagated along its links in just the same way, and will move the wheel into which it fits in just the same way. The action of the part does not depend on the action of any other part as such, but only on the pull or push affecting it, whatever the source of that pull or push may be. Similarly, the action of the part does not depend on any result accruing from the action. Given the pull or push, the action is just the same, whether the result is the normal one of propelling the bicycle, or is simply to whirl the hind-wheel round in the air, or to create a jam and a wreck. In a mechanical whole, then, each part acts uniformly in response to a given force independently of the condition of other parts,* and independently of the results of its action. Part of the behaviour of living beings exhibits a similar independence. A reflex action, for example, like blinking, appears to be the response of a specific structure given uniformly to a specific stimulus. The blood flows along the arteries projected by an impulse from the heart, much as it might be forced along the dead arteries by a pump. Fluids and gases are interchanged through membranes of the body as outside the body they are interchanged by osmosis. In such processes the body appears to be acting mechanically, but, as Dr. Haldane has shown, when we come to look into each process more narrowly a divergence from the mechanical model appears. The interchange of gases and liquids in the living tissue does not * So far as the past condition of other parts has gone to determine the push or pull upon the part considered, it is of course relevant to its action, but the simultaneous or future state of other parts is not relevant, and even the past state is not essentially so, as a pull or push from any other source will have the same effect. Briefly, the action of any one part does not depend on that of other parts as such.</page><page sequence="54">64 L T. HOBHOUSE correspond precisely to the diffusion in inanimate tissue. The reflex may be inhibited and varied in greater or less degree, and the variations are all in one direction. They are such as to serve the requirements of the entire body as a structure maintaining itself in and through changes. Thus, e.g., the respiratory system works normally like a mechanism for the supply of oxygen and the elimination of carbon dioxide. But the needs of the organism frequently vary, more oxygen being required at one time and less at another, more carbon dioxide needing elimina- tion now and less a little later on. The respiratory system shows a delicate responsiveness to these needs. Thus, on the face of the facts, it does not act like a bit of a machine, independently of the rest, but in some correlation with the living structure as a whole. Now, it may be that this adjustment is in reality effected, by a more subtle mechanism. We can in our machines introduce contrivances, like the gyroscope, which adapt their actions to the requirement of the whole going concern. The mechanical theory of life is that all adaptations in the living body are the work of such contrivances, so that, just as there is a gross mechanism of respiration in general, so there are subtler, more cunning, mechanisms which adapt variations in respiration to varying states of the body, but all by an indirect process which preserves the independence of each several part. The arrange- ment, it is suggested, is such that the force operating on the part does in general vary in consonance with the organic requirement. This is planned out beforehand. But there is no method by which the requirements arising here and now act directly on the part which serves them, i.e., are themselves the forces stimulating the part. Now, the existence of such mechanisms is a question of fact, but for the moment we are concerned with the definitions suggested by a certain view of the facts, and worth clearing up even if it should turn out at the end that there is nothing in nature corresponding to them. The definition suggested by the facts, then, is that in organic</page><page sequence="55">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 65 activity* the parts do not act quite independently of one another, but the requirements of the whole or, perhaps, of some other part are operating influences upon each part. The defini- tion raises questions which I will return to later, but I would look first at certain other aspects of the activity of living beings. I want to light my pipe, and feel, mechanically as we say, in my pocket for the match box. Then I remember that in this year, called of grace, 1918, matches are scarce, and I resign myself to the use of a clumsy spill, which I twist and turn about till a light is secured. There is here a little series of actions apparently determined by the end which they subserve. The expression is difficult because the end said to determine the acts does not exist when the act is performed, but the difficulty is, I think, removed if we so far alter the phrase as to say that not the end, but its own tendency to produce the nd, brings each successive act about. The various acts form parts of a whole which, as a whole, has a certain culminating result, the lighted pipe, and their causative relations to this result are the true determinants of the acts. They are initiated, dropped, maintained, varied, combined,-all in such ways as from moment to moment tend to the result. Thus, the purposive act is caused, so to say, by its own effect or, more strictly, by its tendency to produce the effect, and this causation brings each step into an organic relation with the other steps that are equally necessary to the effect. It may be said that this is not an ultimate analysis. A particular movement, e.g., a twist of the spill, is made because it will bring the flame into closer contact with the tobacco, but it is made by my will as a consequence of knowledge and expectations left by antecedent experience in my mind. The movement of the spill, then, is not determined * The definition suggested is a definition of organic activity not of an organism or organic whole, which would require a somewhat more general formula. For our purpose, however, which is to contrast distinct modes of action, the definition, which indicates an essential character of organism, will be found convenient.

True, it is within the mind that the real purpose lies, but here in its true home the essence of purpose will be found to be just what we have described. Ideas, perceptions, efforts, are taken up, pressed, discarded, varied, brought into relation in such a way as to serve the result, so that the purpose is an organisation of elements determined by relation to the effect which it produces, and if we look to the centre of this organi- sation, in the case instanced a desire, we find its very nature unstateable except by an inclusion of reference to the result. It is nothing if not an impulse towards an end. The tendency to bring something about does not merely determine but rather constitutes it. Now, purposive activities, as we know them, rest on a central impulse of this type, and, certain obscure and abnormal cases apart, involve awareness of what we are doing and antici- pation of what is coming. But an intelligent observer from another planet, knowing nothing of human organisation, would, I suggest, infer logically from the behaviour of human beings that here were curiously constructed bodies determined in many of their operations by that which comes out of those operations, though by what means he might not be able to tell. His conclusion would be that there was something in those beings which secures that their actions are conditioned by their own causal tendency, and are thus differentiated fundamentally from other actions which do not vary in accordance with any results that emerge from them, but are, so to say, complete in themselves. We have, now, three definitions before us. A whole is mechanical when and in so far as its parts act uniformly in response to the forces operating on each of them, not varying in relation to the results of their action or to the state of other parts. A whole acts organically when and in so far as the operation of any part is varied in accordance with the</page><page sequence="57">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 67 requirements of the whole as a self-maintaining structure. A whole acts purposively in so far as its acts are determined by their own tendency to produce results affecting the whole. On analysis, I think the second of these definitions will be found to resolve itself into a case either of the first or of the third. How does the "-requirement" of the organism operate upon the part ? It may be that the "requirement" is to be interpreted as a certain physical condition falling short of the normal (or exceeding it). E.g., the blood is insufficiently oxidised. The lack of oxidation may then act as a stimulus on a certain tissue such as the respiratory centre in the medulla, exciting it to an enhanced activity which redresses the balance. This is at bottom a mechanical explanation, and if all the recuperative and regenerative processes of the body can be so explained, then they are ultimately mechanical. On the other hand, it may be that the requirement of more oxygen is itself the stimulus exerting the tissue to an effort to supply it, i.e., the action of the tissue is determined by relation to its result. The difficulty in this interpretation is that it seems to make the tissue a conscious being acting with a purpose. But it is clear from a review of actions that definite purpose is the most developed species of a genus called conation. In all conation the tendency of the act towards the result is a condition, but in the lowest forms of conation this tendency is obscurely reflected in consciousness and is indirect in action. In the lowest stages it is, perhaps, no more than a felt lack or uneasiness which stimulates whatever be the characteristic activity of an organism, or an organ, to a higher pitch. If this activity begins to give relief, it is maintained till relief is fully achieved, when the need vanishes and the effort with it. If it fails the activity is, perhaps, inhibited, giving place to another, or if there is no alternative, it is increased to a maximum fruitlessly till exhaustion ensues. All these modes of response are verifiable, as Jennings has shown, among the lowest known independent organisms, and it is E2</page><page sequence="58">68 Lt T. HOBHOUSE. conceivable that something like them, or possibly some still lower grade of conation, should be found in cells of the metazoon. I would suggest, though I must leave it to others with more knowledge to apply and test the suggestion, that so far as the operation of organic parts appears to be dominated by the requirements of the organism, the operation is either due to a subtle mechanism or to a low grade of conation. If it is such that what we call the requirement of the organism expresses itself as a force operating by push or pull on the molecules of the partial structure it is a mechanism. If it is such as to cause an uneasiness in the part, and this uneasiness sets up an activity tending to remove it and continued or varied until the removal is effected, then the system is conational.* I doubt if there is another alternative. We have seen that the pur- posive system is organic in that its parts are essentially related to the whole which depends upon them. I now suggest that the organic system is in a general sense purposive, i.e., at least conational, becoming purposive at its higher removes. The purposive and the mechanical, on the other hand, remain fundamentally distinct categories. Whether anything exists in correspondence with the pur- posive category is, of course, another, and it is a harder, question. There are real and unreal difficulties. The real diffi- culty is to get a definite external test of purposive determina- tion. Machines are made by the human mind and hand to execute human purposes. Though each part of such machines acts independently, yet the machine may be so contrived, by * Observe that there is at bottom no question of the part acting without a stimulus, even if you will a force, impressed on it. The question is whether the requirement of the organism or of another part is itself such a stimulus, or whether things are so arranged that the physical condition giving rise to that requirement normally conveys a stimulus. In the apparent result the second method may be brought to coincide with the first in proportion to the delicacy of the mechanism and the power of providing for all the contingencies of varying requirements.</page><page sequence="59">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 69 taking thought for contingencies, as to vary its action suitably to the varying requirements of the purpose which the maker had in view. The limit of such variability is that, however much the machine process may change, it must still be change from one uniform type-process to another. An indefinite number of types of required action may be foreseen and provided for, but they must all be types. Purpose, on the other hand, being bona fide. guided by the relation of each particular act to its particular end, may be wholly individual. On behalf of the mechanical view, the reply might be made that the distinction if clear in principle is not applicable without ambiguity to actual behaviour. May not the living being be a machine devised to meet a vastly greater number of con- tingencies than any inanimate machine, but so devised that each contingency just supplies the necessary stimulus to the necessary parts to act in such a way as is consonant with the maintenance of the organism ? On behalf of this view, there would not be lacking evidence of blindness and mechanical tendency in human, as in other animate, behaviour. Two things, however, must be said:- (a) There seems no theoretical limit to the plasticity of human purpose. No range is too vast, no consideration too remote, no correlation too complex to affect our action if occasion calls. We are nowhere finally stopped, and it is this, not the absence of continuity in character, which is what we really mean by freedom. (b) If this freedom of range could in any way be supposed to rest on a pre-established structure, so formed as always to act suitably to the required effect, yet without being determined by the actual relation of the given act here and now to the effect, it would postulate the operation of a creative mind of infinite scope, capable of foreseeing and providing for every detail of our individual lives. That such a structure should be the product of heredity is wildly impossible. Our evolution is from simpler and more general to more highly</page><page sequence="60">70 L. T. HOBHOUSE. organized and individualized activity, and can at best only supply a structure suited to respond uniformly to situations of a general character. The mechanical view must break with evolution and postulate a Calvinistic deity and a detailed predestination. The main objection to this view is that the world is not one which we can fit in with the possible plans of a mind unconfined by any limitations. There may be evidences of purpose in the world-personally I think there are-but not of unconstrained, undefeated purpose. They are of one or more purposes that are constantly broken, limited, incomplete. Nor is there any way of escape by supposing the infinite mind to be stupid or bad, for in the region of mind badness, stupidity and limitation are at bottom almost convertible terms. There are then strong reasons for rejecting predestination. Predestination-determination by an exterior purpose-seems the only alternative to the admission of determination by internal purpose. The more unreal difficulty is that to which most weight has been attached. It is supposed that the whole physical world moves mechanically. The living being is physical. Therefore, it moves mechanically. Either the major or the minor premiss really assumes the point in question. We may grant if we will that everything that is purely physical moves mechanically, but is the conscious living being purely physical ? If the term "purely" is omitted, the major premiss becomes doubtful. We are not to suppose a physical body somewhere within which a soul is seated, acted on by the impact of molecules and reacting upon them. What we call the physical is just as much of reality as is known to us by the senses and various inferences which we draw by putting the reports of the senses together. We have not the smallest reason to assume that what we so get exhausts the nature of any real thing, unless we find that it explains the whole behaviour of that thing. Now, in the case of living beings, we find just the contrary and, moreover, of one of these</page><page sequence="61">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 71 living beings, every one of us has independent and first hand information showing that it contains elements that are not physical. What is the difficulty of supposing that these elements play their part in determining its behaviour, i.e., that the living being is a psychophysical whole in which the parts are held together and their action correlated by elements- forces if you will-which are determined in their direction by the results to which their actions tend as they affect the living whole ? Objection is, perhaps, taken on the ground of a supposed breach of continuity, but none such exists, if body and soul instead of being regarded as separate entities are taken as names for distinguishable (and possibly incomplete) aspects of one real being. Or, is it alleged that we are postulating a motion or change in the direction of a motion without a force to cause it ? If the term force is used, not for a rate of acceleration, but for a cause of motion, that is not the case. The conative condition is a force producing motion. The question is merely in what ways and in what directions such a force acts, and the answer that it is directed towards results in no way affects its capacity to direct motion. Or, is it supposed that causation is denied, the truth being that the attempt is merely to discover what kind of cause purpose is ? That the purpose as something found in you or me grows out of what we were before is not questioned. If the objection turns on none of these points, it comes simply to this, that all causation must be mechanical-which was to be proved, but is not.</page><page sequence="62">72 J. S. HALDANE. SYMPOSIUM: ARE PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IRREDUCIBLE ? V.-Reply by J. S. HALDANE. IN replying to criticisms on my own paper, 1 am glad to find that the differences between the different contributors to the symposium are in important respects less fundamental than appears on the surface. Professor D'Arcy Thompson points out that there are end- less inorganic phenomena of which we cannot at present, or till recently could not, give a physical or chemical explanation; but that on this account there is no reason to discard the physical and chemical principles which have served us so well in other directions. He argues that there is equally no reason for doubting the ultimate application of physical and chemical principles in biology, although in connexion with biological facts the temporary failures of physical and chemical explana- tions may be very prominent. Now, if it were only a matter of the temporary failure of physical and chemical explanations in many parts of biology, I should agree with his reasoning; but my argument was based on positive, and not merely on negative facts. He does not neglect the positive facts, but I think he hardly does justice to them. He argues that the self- regulation and self-maintenance which are so characteristic of life are equally present in what we regard as mechanisms-for instance, the solar system, or even ordinary machines. The solar system, as we at present conceive it, continues to work regularly just in so far as it is not disturbed from without, and its behaviour as a whole can, unlike an organism, be predicted from the simple properties, movements, and relative positions of its separate parts. It is precisely the same for any machine. A machine may happen to work a little better after some use,</page><page sequence="63">LIFE AND FINITE INDIVIDUALITY. 73 but it inevitably wears out. The life-history of an organism is surely something very different from the history of a machine. Professor Thompson argues that the developing germ, along with its environment, may be regarded as a mechanism. But the physical and chemical environment, as such, is a mere pandemonium, differing for each germ, and calculated to produce in each germ different results, just as the soap-suds in the bowl he refers to differ according to how air is blown into the soap- solution. In the germ and its environment there is surely an element of immanent order, which the mechanical conception wholly fails to express ? I fully accept Professor Thompson's suggestion that it is only the "ordinary" working hypotheses of physics and chemistry that seem to me inadequate in biology. Recent developments of experimental physics and chemistry are pro- foundly changing these conceptions, and, as it seems to me, tending to bring physics and chemistry not only much closer to one another, but also much closer to biology. Here, then, our differences seem to disappear. Dr. Chalmers Mitchell agrees with me in so far as he con- siders that at present mind cannot be interpreted or stated in terms of physiology or anatomy, nor biology in terms of chemistry or physics. He refuses, however to commit himself as regards the future, and he lays special emphasis on the con- tention that life, and even mind, cannot be interpreted apart from physics and chemistry, since both biological and psycho- logical activity are dependent on physical and chemical changes. He goes on, however, to admit that the conceptions of physics and chemistry are rapidly moving towards those of biology. With this admission he and I, though at first we seemed far apart, come very close together, just as Professor Thompson and I do; and my concluding remarks with regard to Professor Thompson's contribution apply also to that of Dr. Mitchell. Professor Hobhouse gives an admirably clear analysis of the</page><page sequence="64">74 J. S. HALDANE. nature of mechanism as ordinarily conceived, and the difference between a mechanism and a living organism; but he differs from me in this respect, that he eliminates the specifically biological conception or category. He thus attributes the difference between a living organism and a mechanism to the manifestation in the former of conation or purposive action, though often in a very low and ill-defined form. It does not seem to me that this theory furnishes a satis- factory practical working hypothesis to the ordinary physio- logist or morphologist who has to deal with the every day observations of biology, more particularly on what is ordinarily called the chemical side. These observations do not suggest anything like conscious purpose: the reactions observed are "blind." Yet the self-maintenance and self-determination of a whole are quite clearly manifested in them, and they are, there- fore, not mechanical in any ordinary sense. It seems to me, therefore, that we are in practical need of a biological, as distinguished from either a psychological or physical working hypothesis. In other respects, I think that Professor Hobhouse and I are in pretty close agreement.</page></plain_text>
