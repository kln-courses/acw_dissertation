Honorable Mention, Humanities Cosmogony and the Ten Separated Intellects in the Rahat al-'Aql of Hamld al-Dln al-KirmanT Daniel Carl Peterson, Ph.D. UCLA The PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM elaborated by the FatimT Isma'TlT da'i al-Kir manT strongly recalls the scheme of ten separated intellects laid out by his non-Isma'IlT predecessor al-Farabl. The resemblance is striking, but not absolute. At a crucial point, al-KirmanT unexpectedly rejects the Farabian model of Neoplatonic emanation and opts for creation ex nihilo. To explain this, I compare his chief work, the Rahat al-'Aql, to al-Far abl's Al-Madma al-Fadila. I also examine Plotinus' Enneads and the pseud epigraphic Theology of Aristotle, both to determine what the doctrines and implications of Neoplatonism are, and to see how fully al-Kirmanl adopts them. Finally, I investigate certain events in Egypt under al-Hakim, identi fying politico-historical stimuli which may have encouraged al-KirmanT to reject emanationism. Al-KirmanT represents one chapter in the long interaction between two strains of thought—Platonic and Qur'anic—about the relationship between God and man. The Platonic view allowed such a relationship, but denied divine anthropomorphism; the Qur'anic view allowed divine anthropomorphism, but denied any genetic relationship between man and God. As Hellenistic philosophical notions entered Islam, the Platonic and MESA Bulletin 25 1991</page><page sequence="2">42 Malcolm H. Kerr Awards Qur'anic viewpoints struggled for dominance. This theological problem grew acute within Neoplatonized Isma'llism when members of the da'wa claimed al-Hakim to be divine. By adopting a philosophical theology which simultaneously denied an thropomorphism and severed the Platonic linkage between the human and the divine, al-Kirmanl perfected an Islamic via negativa and undercut the position of his opponents in the formative Druze movement. First Place, Social Sciences Avenues of Participation: Family and Politics in Urban Quarters of Cairo DIANE Singerman, Ph.D. Princeton University The voices, experiences, AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY of men and women from the lower strata of society are largely unrepresented in studies of po litical participation. Those communities and groups which are excluded from formal political participation, or do not choose to participate, remain "unaccounted for" and "uncounted." This dissertation examines the politi cal community of the sha'b (or popular classes) in Cairo. It suggests that excluded communities develop effective collective strategies to accomplish shared goals, despite the intentions of political elites and governmental institutions to control the formal political system and policy-making. This study investigates the material needs, priorities, values, and tra ditions of a community in Cairo to identify the formal and informal in stitutions men and women rely upon to fulfill individual and collective needs. The sha'b utilize familial and informal networks, which weave in and out of the bureaucracy, as a vehicle of political participation. Indi vidual strategies to accumulate savings, provide education for a child, or migrate abroad, when repeated thousands of times, influence the macro allocation and distribution of scarce resources and public goods, as well as political and economic phenomena in the nation. Everyday decisions add up incrementally to shape the boundaries of the political and economic order. A familial ethos represents ideological norms and values which inform communal patterns of distribution, decision-making, and behavior in the community. This familial ethos resonates upwards as well when people judge the state and its institutions. Patterns of acumulation, consumption, and investment in the community and the nation are deeply influenced by the shared objective of reproducing the family. Informal networks meet fundamental needs in the community, such as earning a living, reproducing the family, accumulation and investment, and coping with the bureaucracy. These networks aggregate the interests of the sha'b and represent them in a collective fashion in the larger community. The informal economy provides employment and investment opportunities for this community and fuels MESA Bulletin 25 1991</page><page sequence="3">Malcolm H.

The government maintains its commitment to providing certain basic goods and services to the sha'b in return for political acquiescence. Citizens participate by consuming, and the government maintains its legitimacy through distribution. To be political, and remain out of danger, is to consume. To be political, and be in danger, is to participate seriously in formal politics. While this arrangement may enhance political stability and provide some autonomy for the sha'b's pursuit of "low politics," it does little to resolve the difficult economic and political problems which Egypt faces.

The Negotiation of Orthodoxy: An Ethnographic Study of the Assimilation Strategies of Religious Soviet Jewish Immigrants to Israel KEVIN Joseph LoURIE, Ph.D. Brown University This ethnographic study of the ultra-orthodox Soviet Jewish immigrant population in Jerusalem, Israel analyzes the pragmatics of language, text, discourse, and practice within the yeshiva, family, community, and state do mains. A theory of "the negotiation of orthodoxy" is presented, based upon description of the specific "strategies of assimilation" used by members of the study groups. It is shown that through ritual performance, termed "ritual praxis," the ultra-orthodox strategy of assimilation is a means for the acquisition of certain rights and privileges and the establishment of elite immigrant communities in Israel. Tracing the migration experience from the underground refusnik movement of the Soviet Union to the initial absorption and religious resocialization processes in Jerusalem, we see how community models are reconstructed around religious doctrine, in relation to the larger historical context. Thus, the linguistic, textual, and interac tive dynamics of the interpretation and application of religious codes are correlated with the personal life, family relations, community roles, and political orientations of new members.
