<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIOBIOLOGY OR BALANCED BIOSOCIAL THEORY? JOHN D. BALDWIN JANICE I. BALDWIN University of California, Santa Barbara Increasing numbers of sociologists are showing interest in bio- social theories. We present three central criteria for a balanced biosocial theory, i.e., a theory which provides a balanced inte- gration of both genetic and environmental determinants of behavior. Ethology and sociobiology do not possess the properties of balanced theories; and Type II errors make it unlikely that they will reject the key assumptions which make them unbalanced. There are at least four alternatives through which sociologists can pursue balanced biosocial theories and research. As soci- ologists expand and refine their discipline, it is only logical that balanced biosocial theories will be incorporated to guard against genetic and environmental extremes. In recent years there has been a considerable reawakening of interest in animal social behavior within the discipline of soci- ology. There has been an increasing number of attempts to relate the social sciences to a biological base, to apply ethological principles to human social behavior, and to determine the rele- vance of sociobiology for sociology (Mazur and Robertson, 1972; Mazur, 1973; van den Berghe, 1974, 1975; Ellis, 1977; Eck- berg, 1977). Also, there has been a growing number of well- attended sections at both regional and national meetings; and the Biosociology Newsletter is gaining ever wider circulation among sociologists. Although earlier generations of sociologists ended their brief flirtation with social Darwinism with a radical rejection of animal studies, the pendulum appears to be swinging back. Many sociologists are willing to consider the relevance of the biological view: Humans are animals, and behavior is mediated PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW, Vol. 23, No. 1, January 1980 3-27 @ 1980 Pacific Sociological Assn. 3</page><page sequence="2">4 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 by a biological organism which has species-typical charac- teristics, limits, and propensities. The big questions now are: Can sociology and biology be made to dovetail? If so, what will the eventual synthesis look like? Ethology was the first biological theory of behavior, origi- nating in Europe in the early part of the twentieth century. Using field studies of animals in their natural environments along with experiments in the laboratory and the field, ethology applied evolutionary principles to the analysis of behavior. More re- cently, sociobiology has combined ethological material with population genetics, behavioral ecology, and theories of repro- ductive strategy to synthesize a unifying theory that claims great power in providing a biological explanation of social behavior and social organization. The purpose of this article is to establish criteria for adequate biosocial theories of human behavior, to evaluate ethology and sociobiology vis-h-vis these criteria, and-finding these two paradigms deficient-to propose acceptable alternatives for the use of biological data and theories in the human social sciences. BALANCED BIOSOCIAL THEORY We believe that before sociologists select any biological theories for use in the human studies, it is wise to establish general criteria against which to evaluate those theories. We suggest the following three criteria as basic features of a desirable biosocial theory. A central criterion for an adequate theory is that it not be biased toward either nature or nurture. An adequate theory must avoid the extreme environmentalism of Watson's (1924) be- haviorism or of those sociologists who refuse to acknowledge the biological nature of Homo sapiens, the animal. On the other hand, an adequate theory must avoid the other extreme of bio- logical determinism, such as James's (1890) or McDougall's (1908) instinct psychology or other theories of genetically pre- programed behavior. An adequate biosocial theory must be</page><page sequence="3">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 5 balanced to contain an empirically defensible mixture and inter- action of biological and environmental factors. This is not easy. Although scientists have been told since the 1950s (Beach, 1955; Anastasi, 1958) to avoid extreme nature-nurture positions and to seek a balanced synthesis of both biological and environ- mental variables, the goal eludes many researchers and theorists. Second, a balanced biosocial theory will have to involve multicausal models of behavior, with room for interaction effects among the numerous causes. The multiple causes fall into two main categories: phylogenetic and ontogenetic, i.e., those that shape the evolution of the species and those that shape the development of each individual from the moment of conception through the remainder of life. These two sets of causes are also known as the distal and proximal causes of behavior, since the phylogenetic causes are distant in time and the ontogenetic are proximate. The phylogenetic causes include a multitude of factors that fall into two broad categories: phylogenetic inertia and eco- logical pressures, which are the primary determinants of natural selection (Wilson, 1975). A species' phylogenetic history of specialization and generalization imposes constraints on the direction and speed of its present evolution. Superimposed on this phylogenetic legacy are the mutations and genetic recombi- nations that produce immense variety and individuality in each new generation (Mayr, 1978). This variety, in turn, is the raw material for natural selection. Variations that are adaptive for an individual vis-it-vis the multiple demands of the current social and nonsocial environment confer competitive advantages and a statistically greater probability of surviving and leaving offspring. Differential survival and differential reproduction are the mechanisms that continuously sort the genes of a popu- lation, selecting in favor of genes that encode the information that produces an adaptive fit to the multiple ecological pressures. Thus the genetic causes of any trait reflect prior phylogenetic causes. The ontogenetic causes of behavior shape the development of each individual from the moment the genetic endowment is</page><page sequence="4">6 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 fixed at conception. Whereas the genetic information represents a "blueprint" for physiological development, the environment provides the building blocks from which the developing organism is constructed. In mammals, for example, the manner in which the genotype is expressed in the developing fetus is influenced by numerous proximal causes such as the mother's diet, exposure to poisons or drugs, disease, stress, hormone titers, and anoxia. After birth, each individual interacts more directly with the environment, since it is less protected by the mother's biological systems. Postnatal physical development is shaped by nutrition, toxins, diseases, foreign chemicals (or drugs), falls, injuries, infections, parasites, exercise levels, and so forth. In addition, the hormonal and central nervous systems are structured and modified by general levels of stress and sensory stimulation, patterned sensory input, and specific learning experiences. During the life of each individual there is a continuous inter- action between genetic and environmental influences; hence a balanced biosocial theory must attempt to integrate both, in- cluding the often complex interaction effects among the multiple factors. Third, a balanced biosocial theory must also adjust the weight- ing of phylogenetic, ontogenetic, and interaction effects accord- ing to the phylogenetic level of the species being studied. When analyzing the behavior of honeybees, for example, a heavy weighting must be attributed to genetic influences, a small but crucial weighting is attached to the nutrients and chemicals given to the developing larva which determine its cast as queen or worker, and a small to moderate weighting is allocated to learn- ing. (Other weightings would be affixed to the remaining causal variables.) In contrast, an analysis of chimpanzee behavior would reveal a much reduced impact of genetic information along with increases in the weighting of ontogenetic variables, especially in the area of learning. Since neither phylogenetic nor ontogenetic inputs to an indi- vidual's behavior are ever zero at any phyletic level, extreme nature or nurture arguments never supersede balanced biosocial theories. As sociologists expand and refine their discipline, it is</page><page sequence="5">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 7 only logical that balanced biosocial theories will be incorporated to guard against genetic and environmental extremes. DO ETHOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY PASS THE TEST? If ethology and sociobiology are balanced biosocial theories, there is no reason to look beyond them. However, we shall try to demonstrate that both ethology and sociobiology carry such strong weighting in favor of phylogenetic and genetic causes as the primary determinants of behavior that they are inherently un- balanced when applied to humans and other "higher" animals. Since the "modern synthesis" of evolutionary theory was estab- lished in the 1920s and 1930s, neo-Darwinian thought has been "the organizing principle of biology" (Mayr, 1978). Both ethology and sociobiology are so strongly grounded in this biological tradi- tion that they consistently overemphasize distal causes-which sociobiologists proudly call the "ultimate causes"-of behavior. The principal objective of ethology has been to apply the evolu- tionary perspective to the study of behavior. Ethologists trace their science to the work of Darwin, who made several significant contributions to the explanation of behavior in light of evolution- ary ideas. "Darwin's procedure could be characterized by saying that he treated behaviour as organs-as components of an animal's equipment for survival" (Tinbergen, 1973: 130). Hein- roth (1911) continued in this tradition, with a strong emphasis on "innate" behavior, i.e., behavior that shows little or no modi- fiability by the environment during an individual's life. Subse- quently Lorenz advanced the experimental and theoretical devel- opment of ethology so much that he has been called "the father of modern ethology" (Huxley, 1963). His interests lay primarily in instinctual behavior (both their mechanisms and their survival value) and the maturation of innate patterns under internal bio- logical control. According to Lorenz (1970: 281), "the instinctive behaviour pattern has the same properties as an organ; in the ontogeny of the instinctive behaviour pattern factors operate</page><page sequence="6">8 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 which are very similar to those operating in the ontogenetic devel- opment of organs." Since the physiological development of most organs is under rather strong genetic control, the assumption that behavior can be treated as if it were an organ builds in an auto- matic bias toward genetic rather than ontogenetic explanations. Lorenz's position elicited severe criticism by many students of behavior for its excesses, its imbalanced position, and its lack of concern for ontogenetic determinants of behavior (Lehrman, 1953; Hebb, 1953; Schneirla, 1956). In the 1960s ethologists showed a clear sign of increasing interest in ontogenetic variables, at least in their theories if not in their predominant research topics. Lorenz (1965) described a relatively balanced overview of animal behavior theory; however, most of his subsequent work reflects a continued commitment to the evolutionary perspective, to models of unmodifiable behavior patterns, and to a conviction that traits crucial for survival are biologically determined (Lorenz, 1974, 1977). Tinbergen's central interests have been the study of instinct, hierarchies of instincts, and evolutionary adaptiveness of be- havior to ecological pressures. He follows "the time-honoured comparative method . . . [and] interprets differences between allied species in terms of adaptive evolutionary divergence; and similarities between otherwise dissimilar species in terms of adap- tive convergence" (Tinbergen, 1973: 211). British ethology has tended to be less unbalanced than continental ethology. Tin- bergen (1973: 214), for example, has focused considerable atten- tion on the ontogeny of behavior, recognizing that "behaviour patterns can be placed, according to their development, on a scale ranging from highly resistant to variations in the environment to highly modifiable." Lest the reader get the wrong idea, he clarifies that learning (the most modifiable behavior) "is not random, but its occurrence, what is learnt and how it is learnt, are prescribed internally within relatively narrow limits" (Tinbergen, 1973: 215). While some contemporary ethologists have clearly attempted to bring balance to ethology,' a perusal of the current ethological journals clearly demonstrates that the majority of ethologists are much more interested in the traditional biological topics than in ontogeny.</page><page sequence="7">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 9 The evolutionary perspective is often well balanced for explain- ing behavior that is under strong genetic control. Ethologists have made excellent contributions to the analyses of both the behavior of "lower" organisms and the more stereotyped, invariant features of "higher" organisms (e.g., stereotyped signals, con- straints on learning, and preparedness to learn certain associa- tions). Much of their research will serve as a solid foundation for future work. While some ethologists were at least attempting to integrate ontogeny into their overall program in the 1960s, changes in genetic theories of behavior were setting the stage for the rise of sociobiology. In 1962 Wynne-Edwards attempted to use ethologi- cal ideas in conjunction with theories of group selection to demonstrate that animals cooperate to produce adaptive levels of population density. For numerous reasons his theory caused quite a reaction among animal researchers. Of relevance here is the fact that Wynne-Edwards strayed from the strict Darwinian logic that individuals-in order to maximize their own reproduc- tive success-are thrown into reproductive competition that makes cooperative reproductive restraint and group selection very unlikely. Many biologists were challenged to explain cooper- ative social behavior in strict Darwinian terms. Williams (1966: 270) was among the most influential of the critics, arguing that "we must take the theory of natural selection in its simplest and most austere form, the differential survival of alternative alleles, and use it in an uncompromising fashion whenever a problem of adaptation arises." Hamilton (1964) set the stage for modern sociobiology with his theory of kin selection. By assuming that selection operates on the genes, rather than on individual animals, Hamilton could demon- strate that "altruistic" behavior directed to close kin was in many cases a rational evolutionary strategy. Altruism pays off for the genes if the risk to the altruist is less than (1) the benefit to the recipient times (2) the coefficient of relatedness (the fraction of genes they share in common due to common kinship). During the next decade evolutionary biologists expanded on this work. Wynne-Edwards was refuted and a new system based on a pure,</page><page sequence="8">10 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 austere genetic theory arose to fill the gap. The new paradigm sug- gested fresh interpretations for numerous forms of social be- havior and generated a host of new topics for research. Attracted by the promise of exciting research and potential breakthroughs, many climbed on the bandwagon and sociobiology gathered momentum. In the 1920s and 1930s, Mendelian genetics and Darwinian selection were merged in what is called the "Modern Synthesis." The sociobiologists see their breakthroughs in the study of social behavior as the next great advance in evolutionary theory, hence the subtitle of Wilson's (1975) text, Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The "central dogma" of sociobiology asserts "the pervasive role of natural selection in shaping all classes of traits in organisms" (Wilson, 1975: 21-22). (In contrast, a balanced biosocial theory states that both natural selection and ontogenetic factors shape behavior.) Since sociobiology claims that "natural selection is the agent that molds virtually all of the characteristics of a species" (Wilson, 1975: 67), little attention is paid to proximal ontogenetic causes of behavior. Socialization is reduced to a "multiplier effect," which is claimed to multiply small genetic influences into large effects on behavior and social organization. Sociobiologists continue the ethological tradition by assuming that "behavior and social structure, like all other biological phenomena, can be studied as organs, extensions of the genes that exist because of their superior adaptive value" (Wilson, 1975: 22). The sociobiologists' preoccupation with phylogenetic and genetic explanations can be seen throughout their work. For example, only one chapter out of twenty-seven in Wilson's (1975: 145) tome deals with ontogenetic mechanisms; and even this chapter begins with a debatable six-page argument that claims "all social traits of all species are capable of a significant amount of rapid evolution at any time."2 A smattered sampling of proxi- mal mechanisms receives only cursory attention in the remainder of the chapter. In sharp contrast to the perfunctory coverage of proximal mechanisms, Wilson devotes entire chapters, lengthy mathematical explanations, and numerous graphs and tables to</page><page sequence="9">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 11 explain the details of heritability, coefficients of inbreeding and kinship, gene flow, changes in gene frequencies, reproductive strategies, population growth, extinction rates, and other particu- lars of evolutionary theory. The genes get the limelight, while the complexities of ontogenetic mechanisms are given little serious attention. By claiming that natural selection provides the ultimate explanation of behavior, sociobiologists easily convince them- selves that proximal causes need not be studied as autonomous influences on behavior. The powerful forces of natural selection are presumed to program the proximal mechanisms such that everything important is taken care of by genetic control. The proximal "machinery carries out the commands of the genes" (Wilson, 1975: 23). Even the brain, the organ of thought and learning, "is an extension of the gonads" (Ghiselin, 1973: 968) geared "to favor the maximum transmission of the controlling genes" (Wilson, 1975: 4). It is true that ethology and sociobiology research and discuss proximal mechanisms to the degree that these demonstrate how behavior is under command of the genes; however, they have little interest in proximal mechanisms not under genetic control. Humans receive a full chapter in Wilson's text. In addition, human examples are intermingled throughout the book to "clarify" genetic principles, though no evidence is given that the human behavior mentioned has a strong genetic component. Nowhere in Wilson's book do we get the impression that the author thinks his system could be unbalanced for humans. The introduction tells us that "sociology and the other social sciences... are the last branches of biology waiting to be included in the Modern Synthesis" (Wilson, 1975: 4). A selfish, nepotistic morality rooted in genetic survival is seen as the underlying force in human moral thinking. The kind act of the first good samaritan is described as resulting from an "altruist gene" which was at first a "rare mutant" (Wilson, 1975: 120).3 Only evolutionary variables are considered when discussing whether altruistic behavior could survive in a genetically competitive world. Although some sociobiologists claim they are not overly biased toward evolutionary explanations, their actions speak louder</page><page sequence="10">12 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 than their words. The vast majority of their written work reveals their enthusiasm for applying genetic theories to behavior at all phyletic levels. They are not loathe to extend totally genetic "ex- planations" to the domain of human behavior, even though their ideas frequently fly in the face of well-documented psychological, anthropological, and sociological data. Our conclusion is that ethology and sociobiology do not meet any of the three basic criteria for balanced biosocial theories, except in lower species. The theories are strongly biased toward explanations in terms of phylogenetic causes; they consistently neglect the multiple ontogenetic causes that a balanced theory must contain;4 and they attempt to apply the same mixture of explanatory variables to problems at all phyletic levels. TYPE II ERRORS If one assumes that natural selection provides an adequate explanation for all biological characteristics, it is an easy (though unnecessary) step to deduce that all characteristics-including behavior and social organization-are adaptive. The ethologist McFarland (1976: 57) calls this the "principle of optimal design," and explains that "biological structures, subjected for a suffi- ciently long time to a specific set of selective pressures, will tend to assume characteristics which are optimal with respect to those cir- cumstances." Presumably, during natural selection, suboptimal forms will be replaced by ever more well-adapted forms until the optimum is reached. Sociobiology has elaborated on the principle of optimal design by stating that traits will be selected to produce optimal fitness. According to Barash (1977: 63) the "fundamental hypothesis that seems to underlie the discipline of sociobiology . . . states: when any behavior under study reflects some component of genotype,5 animals should behave so as to maximize their inclusive fitness." Trivers (1972, 1974) uses economic models to calculate optimal parental investment strategies and optimal offspring strategies so that genes can maximize their reproductive success. Wilson</page><page sequence="11">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 13 (1975) includes additional discussions of optimum population growth and density, optimum reproductive yields, optimum group structure and size, and so on. He attempts to buttress the idea of optimal design with questionable data on "rapid evolu- tion," claiming that 10 to 15 generations are sufficient for a new optimal equilibrium to be reached when evolutionary pressures change.6 From the principle of optimal design, it is an easy step to func- tional logic. If one observes that an animal does behavior X, then it follows that the behavior must be optimally designed to maximize the animal's inclusive fitness: that is, the behavior must be functional and adaptive. If one wants to "explain" the be- havior, all that is necessary is to locate a plausible function. "A primary aim of primate socio-biology (or socio-ecology) is to explain variation in social behaviour in terms of biological func- tion" (Clutton-Brock and Harvey, 1976: 195). The trouble is that it is extremely difficult to obtain any kind of evidence for evalu- ating or rejecting these hypotheses. In fact it is often quite diffi- cult to reject the null hypothesis that the behavior has no function at all; yet functional explanations remain popular because of their seeming elegance and ease of application. As Rowell (1972) points out, many statements about the adaptiveness of a given primate behavior are mostly speculative, since there is presently very little direct evidence available width which to evaluate them. Welker (1971) states that it would be so difficult to evaluate many of the speculations about the adaptiveness of specific behaviors that the status of these "explanations" as untestable hypotheses makes them virtually unscientific. The ability of observers to invent numerous "adaptive" inter- pretations for almost any behavior (even maladaptive ones) creates a grave risk of erroneously inferring selective and genetic causes for any behavior-even (1) suboptimal or maladaptive behavior and (2) highly learned behavior. First, by assuming opti- mal design, sociobiology neglects the reality of suboptimal be- havior and tends to hunt for adaptive explanations for all behavior. Because people can easily create ad hoc "explanations" for maladaptive or suboptimal behavior, it becomes very difficult</page><page sequence="12">14 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 to discriminate optimally designed, adaptive behavior from any other behavior.7 This in turn leads to the danger of a Type II error concerning the basic assumptions of optimal design and function. If everything can be explained as optimally designed and func- tional, then there is little chance of ever disproving the optimality assumption and little chance of rejections notions that natural selection explains everything (Sahlins, 1976: 84). Consequently there is a grave risk of accepting phylogenetic explanations that should not be accepted. This tends to produce unbalanced theories at any phyletic level.8 Second, because learned behavior often appears to be adaptive and functionally related to environmental conditions, behavior that results primarily from proximal causes can be erroneously attributed to genetic design. This again creates the danger of a Type II error: failing to reject phylogenetic hypotheses that should be rejected. Even if behavioral adaptiveness is undis- putable "we cannot tell from the mere fact that a behavior is adaptive which kind of process [distal or proximal] has been responsible for it" (Skinner, 1969: 194). SUPPORTING EVIDENCE Are the assumptions of optimal design, maximal fitness, and biological functionalism warranted? Sahlins's (1976) critique of sociobiology points out that the process of natural selection does not automatically imply that organisms will tend to be maxi- mizers. It is equally plausible to assume that they will be sufficers. Sahlins argues that the laissez-faire capitalist economic model implicit in sociobiological logic is the spurious source of the maxi- mization assumption. Biological researchers are discovering that nonoptimal traits are extremely commonplace in biological systems. Not only is natural selection not producing optimal designs and adaptations, natural selection tolerates-even generates-a substantial amount of variance (or "slop") in biological systems (Clarke, 1975; Lewontin, 1978).</page><page sequence="13">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 15 On the molecular level, biologists are discovering far more variance in biochemical systems that optimal design predicts, and far more "non-Darwinian" evolution (King and Jukes, 1969) than most biologists would have guessed several decades ago (Kimura, 1968; King and Jukes, 1969; Lewontin, 1974; Ohta and Kimura, 1975; Clarke, 1975; Ayala, 1978). Because biochemical synthesis is under strong genetic control, the existence of substantial vari- ance at the molecular level indicates that genetic information itself-in very old conservative protein systems that have had hundreds of millions of years9 to be "perfected"--is far from optimally designed. "Large numbers of alleles are stored in popu- lations even though they are not maximally adaptive; [and this is guaranteed by five] mechanisms that actively maintain diversity in spite of the selective forces tending to eliminate it" (Ayala, 1978: 63). The slop was not expected by advocates of optimal design because it creates a costly genetic load in terms of sub- optimal traits, inefficiency, infertility, and so on. Biologists have concluded, however, that the load can be seen as acceptable when one appreciates that it is "the entire individual organism, not the chromosomal locus [that] is the unit of selection" (Ayala, 1978: 64).10 The individual's strong points compensate for its weak points. If there is slop in the genetic information, it should be obvious that when the genetic blueprints are interfaced with countless environmental factors during development, many extra levels of variance (which are not genetically determined) can be introduced into the final phenotypic product. This is especially true in the "higher" species, where learning is a well-developed mechanism for modifying behavior according to current environmental conditions. The data on primate behavior indicate that far more behavioral and social variance is present than the principle of optimal design would predict. In a review of primate social organization, Eisenberg et al. (1972: 873) state: Although we can generalize about the selective advantages of primate social structures, we must remember that the history of the population under study, its particular adaptation to local environmental conditions, and the idiosyncratic nature of its</page><page sequence="14">16 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 dyadic relations (which have been ontogenetically established within the particular group) can result in a great deal of varia- bility in social structure, even within the same species when it occurs in widely differing habitats. Spuhler and Jorde (1975) conducted a multivariate quantita- tive analysis on 19 primate variables across 29 population samples and found that phylogenetic and / or genetic factors accounted for less than one-half of the variance. They conclude: "In general, local ecological settings, and probably local social traditions transmitted by learning, are equally, if not more, important deter- minants of primate social behavior" than phylogenetic or genetic determinants. In addition, it is likely that the studies analyzed by Spuhler and Jorde underestimate primate variability. Because a species must be studied in several different environments before the extent of social variability can be estimated, and because many species have not been adequately researched, it is not possi- ble at present to ascertain how much more variability actually exists. Needless to say, the variability in human behavior is enormous; and not all the variability is optimal. The species' genetics clearly establishes certain limits and predispositions that set human be- havior apart from the behavior of other species (Seligman and Hager, 1972; Hinde and Stevenson-Hinde, 1973). However, within that species-typical range, there is enormous behavioral plasticity and variation. Sociobiologists themselves have ad- mitted that biological factors may explain only a small portion of human behavior. In an interview with the Harvard Crimson, Wilson estimated that perhaps only 10% of human behavior could be traced to biological causes (Sahlins, 1976: 65). (People less enthusiastic about sociobiology than Wilson might estimate an even smaller weighting for phylogenetic factors.) The problem is that sociobiologists do not change their theo- retical strategies when dealing with humans (and other "higher" species). They are quite willing to generalize about human be- havior directly from their animal studies in which phylogenetic causes are given primary weighting.</page><page sequence="15">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 17 WAS DARWIN WRONG? Advocating a balanced biosocial theory does not imply that evolutionary theory is wrong. Natural selection is a powerful determinant of physiological structure. What the ethologists and sociobiologists must learn is that evolution and the genes have little direct control over behavior in humans and many other animals. To a large degree, the genes have given up their hege- mony and ontogenetic factors have taken over most of the control of behavior (within species-typical limits). The genes' control over behavior is indirect (Anastasi, 1958). The genes determine that humans will have advanced nervous systems, extensive cortical capacity, language processing centers, a responsiveness to certain stimuli as reinforcers, and so forth. But knowledge about the phylogenetic and genetic factors alone will predict only a small fraction of the actual behavior observed in a given individual. Balanced biosocial theories should not discard evolutionary principles. However, they must avoid the problems that result from a heavy reliance on evolution as the primary organizing principle in behavioral explanation. At present, ethology is less distant from the goal of balanced theory than sociobiology. The sociobiologists, with their newly formulated genetic theories, have shown less interest in ontogeny than ethologists. As long as sociobiologists continue to use the calculus of genetic maximization as the central organizing principle of their discipline, the extreme emphasis on genetic factors will produce unbalanced theories that do not fit the data for many species. Yet the calculus of genetic maximization lies at the core of sociobiological theory and gives it an identity distinct from ethology. In addition, sociobiologists have sunk enormous costs in the study of biological variables that focus their analytic attention on phylogenetic and genetic variables rather than on proximal causes. After sinking a great deal of effort into the study of population biology, reproductive strat- egies, and numerous other technical biological theories, socio- biologists are unlikely to toss these aside and admit that they play a small role in the explanation of human behavior. Indeed, they stand to profit most by suggesting that their biological variables</page><page sequence="16">18 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 explain a larger proportion of behavior than they can empirically demonstrate. Type II errors blind sociobiologists to the inad- equacy of their theories. Hence, it seems likely that sociobiol- ogists will continue to overstate the case for biological causes of human behavior unless constrained by critical studies from other perspectives. Finally, sociobiologists' lack of contact with other behavioral disciplines (partly due to the artificial boundaries maintained by all the traditional disciplines) will retard their learning of material that has been well documented in psychology, anthropology, and sociology. TOWARD A BALANCED BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE Sociologists and other social scientists can pursue balanced biosocial research and theory in a variety of ways that avoid both the extreme evolutionary perspective and extreme environ- mentalism. (1) Adhere to balanced biosocial theories. At the theoretical level, sociologists must insist that biosocial work involves a balanced integration of phylogenetic and ontogenetic variables. By expanding the task of sociology to include an interest in balanced biosocial syntheses, sociologists can take an active part in shaping the theories that will be sufficiently empirically de- fensible to withstand the test of time. If sociologists do not de- mand that biosocial theories be balanced, they only help perpetu- ate the current genetic theories. At present, a logical step would be for sociologists to integrate existing theory and data from the social and biological sciences, with due weighting on proximal and distal causes. This is a constructive role that will generate exemplars of balanced biosocial theories and may help guide ethologists and sociobiologists away from their current over- emphasis on evolutionary mechanisms. (2) Examine, criticize, and replicate work from the biological paradigms. Since the work of ethologists and sociologists has the potential for being biased by unwarranted genetic assumptions, sociologists can play a valuable role in biosocial research by</page><page sequence="17">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 19 critically analyzing the biological work, comparing it with data on humans (and other species), and, if necessary, replicating the work with better controls. The following examples show the value of this type of work. A key feature of sociobiology is its explanation of altruistic and cooperative behavior in terms of inclusive fitness. An altruistic animal may benefit in increased inclusive fitness if it expends effort or runs risks to help kin who share genes in common with the altruist, though the more distant the kinship, the less the effort or risk is cost effective. This genetic interpretation of altruism has led sociobiologists to think that they have the ulti- mate explanation of altruism in general; and they have begun "explaining" human altruism in purely genetic terms (Wilson, 1975, Trivers, 1971)." Mussen and Eisenberg-Berg (1977) have recently balanced the picture on altruism by comparing the re- search from biology, psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Rather than the simplistic, single-causal-variable theory of socio- biology, Mussen and Eisenberg-Berg present a complex, multi- ple-factor model that weaves together biological, psychological, and social-cultural variables in a balanced manner that is well supported by data on human behavior. The research relating sex and gender differentiation to perinatal hormones provides a similar example. When female mice, rats, hamsters, and rhesus monkeys are exposed to androgens peri- natally, they tend to show masculinized behavior later in life. Biological explanations were obviously in order, and for two decades biological researchers did not consider it necessary to study the role of learning or differential social treatment of androgenized females in their theories. Studies on androgenized human females did not demonstrate the clear-cut masculinization seen in the studies of animals; however, the biological explana- tions were extended to "explain" human sex differences. Recently a critical review of the literature by Quadagno et al. (1977) dem- onstrated numerous methodological problems in the various studies, and revealed a great need for controls to test social learn- ing hypotheses. Money's (1975: 71) study of a child who was born male (thus "masculinized" perinatally) "offers nothing to stimu-</page><page sequence="18">20 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 late one's conjectures" that biological predispositions for mascu- linity cannot be overriden by social learning. These critical studies help balance the field and correct the errors biological researchers frequently make. (3) Sociological research on biological mediators of behavior. Because their perspective differs from that of biologists, sociolo- gists are likely to ask different questions about the effect of bio- logical variables on human social behavior. Thus sociologists should feel free to conduct original research on biological mecha- nisms either by direct manipulation or by locating natural experi- ments in natural social settings. Guided by different paradigms, the sociologist will not be "merely replicating" research that right- fully "belongs" to biologists, but doing legitimate sociological inquiry.12 Among the biological influences on social behavior that could be studied from a sociological perspective are the sex (and other) hormones, pheromones,13 nutrition, parasites, genetic variables, right versus left hemisphere dominance in cortical processing, alpha rhythms, heart rate, fatigue, arousal level, physical fitness, and muscular development. Maxur (1976, forthcoming) has begun investigating the relationships between testosterone and male behavior, with special attention to issues of social rank, stress, and mood change. Kagan's and Klein's (1973) field study in Guatamala took advantage of "natural experiments" in nutri- tional and sensory deprivation to determine the impact of early retardation on later development. Money (1968, 1975), Hampson (1965), and Money and Ehrhardt (1972) have capitalized on a variety of "natural experiments" involving sex hormone and physical irregularities to evaluate the influence of biological factors on sex and gender role development. (4) Sociological research on animal behavior and social organi- zation. When it is possible to locate reliable patterns (and related causal variables) in the behavior or social organization of non- human species, these data can serve as a source of heuristic generalizations and tentative hypotheses about human behavior. It is unlikely that these hypotheses will generalize completely- without modification-to humans; however they offer ad-</page><page sequence="19">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 21 vantages that often offset the problem of incomplete generaliza- tion. First, animal studies can serve as a "drawing board" (Premack, 1971: 186) for sketching out and analyzing simplified models of phenomena that are often exceedingly complex in humans. For example, communication and play in primates are a good deal simpler than their human counterparts, and are influenced by a smaller number of causal variables. The simplification often makes it easier to cut through the complexities that the given behavior has in humans to locate the primary causal mechanisms. Second, we stand so close to human behavior that we often can- not see the forest for the trees. We know countless rationaliza- tions to "explain" why a given behavior under study shows unique variations in different individuals. This can sometimes be remedied by studying alien species, especially primates. From the new perspective it is often possible to see generalizations (the forest rather than the trees). The perspective, therefore, can help give insights in our study of human behavior by suggesting simple generalizations about basic underlying behavioral patterns or causal mechanisms that we share with other species. Third, it is possible to conduct multitudes of controlled animal experiments that could not be done on humans, due to practical, ethical, or financial reasons, or due to problematic experimenter effects common with human subjects. It is wise to complement labor- atory experiments with field studies in order to observe how the target behavior interlocks with other behaviors in its natural context. Since the animal studies were used as a simplification device, generalizations to humans should automatically involve a step in which one systematically builds back in special human complexi- ties that would not have been predicted from animal data alone. Thus one would superimpose on primate generalizations a con- cern for relevant contributions from social learning, language, cognitive mediation, cultural influence, social sanctions, and so on. This strategy helps prevent simplistic uses of animal data and attunes the researcher to expect that the unique features of human behavior will interact with the underlying behavioral mechanisms that we share with other animals.</page><page sequence="20">22 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 Generalizations from nonhuman species are strongest when they reflect consistent phylogenetic trends or stable qualities shared by most species closely related to humans. For example, Mazur and Robertson (1972) and Mazur (1973) constructed a primate series from tree shrews, to prosimians, to monkeys, to apes and humans, then compared several behaviors across the series. There were clear trends in length of preadult socialization, face-to-face interaction, ranking mechanisms, and so forth, sug- gesting numerous hypotheses about the observed patterns. Com- parative research on exploration and play in primates indicates that the behavioral mechanisms responsible for these activities are found in all primates studied and may well be shared by humans (Baldwin and Baldwin, 1977, 1978a, 1978b). This re- search has humanistic implications for enhancing creativity and lifelong inquisitiveness in humans. SUMMARY The rising interest of sociologists in biosocial research and theories should be directed toward a balanced biosocial synthesis of multiple-causal factors from both phylogeny and ontogeny. In order to accomplish this task, it will be necessary to avoid extreme genetic theories as well as extreme environmentalism. Social scientists can play a valuable role in the development of future biosocial theories by advocating balanced theories and criticizing and replicating work that does not reflect a balanced concern for the relevant causal variables. In addition, it is legitimate for social scientists to study biosocial phenomena from their unique per- spective, since their work may well produce different findings than similar research in other disciplines. To the degree that we succeed in producing a balanced bio- social science, we can bring beasts back inl4 without the risks of creating beastly theories.</page><page sequence="21">Baldwin, Baldwin / SOCIOBIOLOGY 23 NOTES 1. For example, Hinde (1970, 1974) has attempted to create a synthesis of ethology and comparative psychology in order to balance out the phylogenetic perspective of ethology with an emphasis on learning from comparative psychology. Crook (1970a, 1970b) has been critical of Lorenzian ethology and has attempted to create a new branch of ethology-called social ethology-to better cope with the social behavior of birds and mammals. Among other things, Crook sees primate behavior "as being largely 'shaped' by the environment. The habitat, physical and social, is, as it were, nature's Skinner box providing locally characteristic types and frequencies of natural learning trials in complex schedules that inter-relate to pattern individual behavior as a whole" (1970b: 130). 2. An examination of the data Wilson presents to support his assumption of "rapid evolution" reveals that most involve higher species, where rapid change easily could be learned behavior. Enamored of a genetic theory of behavior, it apparently did not occur to him to entertain this ontogenetic hypothesis. 3. Few behavioral geneticists believe that single genes control single behaviors. A multitude of genes are needed to encode the information that guides the construction of the behavioral machinery that mediates behavior. 4. The fact that sociobiology uses dozens of intervening variables to explain natural selection may give the impression that the second criterion of balanced theory (i.e., a multifactor model) is fulfilled. However, virtually all multiple variables that sociobiology uses are from the domain of evolutionary biology, and very few focus on independent proximal causes of behavior. 5. Since all behavior reflects "some component" of genotype, all behavior is fair game for sociobiological analysis by optimal design. 6. See note 2. 7. Have your students write theoretical papers on the evolution and possible func- tions of acne, migraine headaches, ejaculatory incompetence, vaginismus, and so forth. For example, the function of acne could be to elicit grooming, which then increases the likelihood of sexual interaction, hence the propagation of the genes causing acne. The number of imaginative "explanations" is amazing, especially since a trait can be "ex- plained" as adaptive if it appears to benefit the individual or related kin, or others who have engaged in reciprocal altruism. Proof by adaptiveness can be used to "prove" any- thing, even things that should not have been "proven." 8. Lewontin (1978) gives several other problems involved in creating functional explanations. 9. If hundreds of millions of years cannot produce optimal design, free of slop, it seems unlikely that Wilson's "rapid evolution" could do better in ten to fifteen generations. 10. Note that this conclusion, which is needed to explain genetic load, is different from the sociobiologists' assumption that the "selfish gene" is the unit of selection. 11. The common use of human behavior terms (spite, altruism, and so forth) by sociobiologists may create the illusion that they have explained human behavior. Many serious students of animal behavior advocate not using functional or anthropomorphic terms to describe animal behavior (Jay, 1965: 556). In addition, ethology and socio- biology share a common tradition of arguing by analogy, which legitimates "explaining" some human behavior in terms of analogous behaviors in other animals. This practice has been criticized by many (Boulding, 1967; Barnett, 1968).</page><page sequence="22">24 PACIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW / JANUARY 1980 12.
