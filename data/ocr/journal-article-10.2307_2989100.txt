<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION THE MEANING OF HISTORY RUSHTON COULBORN I THE history of mankind, like other branches of man's knowledge, is most effectively grasped by man's mind in a framework of cause and effect. Since human history is not an isolated episode having no connection with the rest of nature, its causes and effects stretch out temporally and spatially into nonhuman nature. We cannot today identify all those causes and effects, but that is an excellent reason for identify-, ing all we can and seeking the closest pos- sible approximations to the others. Some large difficulties become smaller if the con- nection with the rest of nature is borne con- stantly in mind; man is a biological species sard is to be understood in his biological con- text. The part of nature to which man is nearest is his environment. Compared with the environment of other species, that of man is immense, but we do not know that it comprises the whole of nature because we do not know the whole of nature. As a biological organism man is distin- guished by the remarkable development of his mind; he shares his hands with other primates, and his sense organs with other mammals. We know little about the human mind, but we suppose that there is a part or aspect of it which we call "consciousness," and the only objective knowledge we have of that is through its actions (so far, if at all, as we can distinguish them from actions of other aspects of the organism) and through the physiology of the cortex. The concept of the consciousness of man will here be treated as a useful working hypothesis. The con- sciousness stands at the summit of man's evolutionary ascent, and it is by hypothesis the most important part of what man uses in his contact with his environment. The term "environment" is, in fact, a relative term, for man as a species has a nonhuman environment; but it may be just as useful to consider the environment of the conscious- ness itself, which must include the rest of man's physique as well as his nonhuman en- vironment. When the consciousness reaches up to know itself, it becomes self-conscious- ness, but that is subjective, not objective, knowledge, unless it may be checked against the objective knowledge mentioned above, and that question appears still to be quite an open question. Man's contact with his environment, then, begins with knowing it, and the most important part of his knowledge is, again by hypothesis, objective, conscious knowledge. He may have some difficulty in following knowledge with physical action, but he can- not take any intelligent action except in the light of knowledge. Since man does not at present know all of nature, he does not know whether he is capable of knowing all of na- ture, or whether he ever will know all of nature. He has, I think, a bad habit of as- suming that he is capable of knowing all of nature-that he is physically so endowed that he may some day have objective knowl- edge of all of nature. (He will certainly never know this until, if ever, he has actually achieved objective knowledge of all of na- ture.) Kant objected to this habit, and just a few men have heeded him; others have con- tinued to spin theories which imply that all nature is knowable to man. Such theories are anthropocentric and include subjective elements whose distinction from objective knowledge is soon blurred and often forgot- ten. Action based upon these theories, if it may be said to be intelligent in part, is dangerous to man's evolutionary progress because it is taken upon what is partly un- known, without clear knowledge of how 46</page><page sequence="2">DISCUSSION 47 much is unknown. The concept of a "factor of ignorance" in man's relation with the rest of nature is hereby set up to serve as a warning against such error. In his new book, Man the Measure,' Erich Kahler seeks to interpret human his- tory in the light of the growth of human knowledge and in particular of the growth of the consciousness Inevitably he deals with cause and effect, attributing to the human consciousness (spirit) the function of a cause in human history. He says that it is the faculty of discerning the non-self from the self and of transcending the self that it "manifests itself" in history in such manner that man lives in awareness of himself, of a constant- ly conceived, constantly felt whole of personal life, distinct from both the world around him and his own corporal being, his being in the in- stant . His awareness of himself is a form of discerning, his living outside himself and the in- stant is a form of transcending. Together they enable him to alter instants and merge them in- to a continuity ..... [Thus] he becomes capable of drawing conclusions from the past to the for- mation of- the future, of planning, transforming not only his own life but the life of coming gen- erations [p. 15]. INew York: Pantheon Books, Inc., 1943. 2He uses the term "spirit," which is, I think, near enough to the meaning of consciousness to war- rant the assumption that most of what he says about spirit may equally truly (or untruly) be said about consciousness. I am indebted to a German colleague for drawing my attention to the fact that "spir- it," as used by Kahler, is a translation of the Ger- man Geist. As such it lends itself, at least in Kahler's usage, to various theological values, most of which I regard as illegitimate, if not pernicious. Thus he uses it to contend that other animals lack it entirely, which is improbable in the light of modern biological knowledge and in any case cannot be es- tablished clearly one way or the other; as a result, man first appears on Kahler's evolutionary scene with a mind about like that of, say, a slipper ani- malcule. Again, to say, as Kahler does (p. ii), that the ability to objectivate and subjectivate "is identi- cal with what is understood by the term 'spirit'" may- be true of what Kahler himself understands by it but certainly is not of what the majority of per- sons who use either "spirit" or Geist mean. Kahler's readers should be warned to remember his special definition and to look out for occasions where he oversteps it in a theological direction. It is no misrepresentation of Kahler to, say that this passage makes a statement about causation. But it is not a full statement and is, no doubt, not intended as such. There is no attempt in Kahler's book to treat causa- tion fully. Yet a scientific interpretation-of history is, surely, compelled to attempt this, so far as knowledge permits. The human consciousness stands at the summit of the human evolutionary ascent. It must be the chief cause of the "domi- nance" of man iii nature, as biologists un- derstand that term. But it is certainly far from being the sole cause of man's evolution. An upward evolutionary line is caused in a highly complex manner, all the lower ele- ments in it playing their causal parts as well as the dominant element. The "factor of ig- norance" forbids any claim to set up a prov- en and exact scheme of this causation, but it is possible to get much further than Kah- ler does in terms of approximations and probabilities. To begin with, the conscious- ness is qualitative: it is present in different degrees in different individuals and may be oriented in different directions in different individuals. It is directly affected by the amount and. the complexity of knowledge in the individual mind, while, apart from the question of actual amount of knowledge held by a particular mind, each mind has its own innate, physiological capacity for ab- sorbing and organizing knowledge and so enlarging its consciousness. Any society at any time in its history is made up of a huge variety of different individuals each with his special quality of consciousness. Nor is it at all clear that a lowest com- mon denominator of consciousnesses, or an average of consciousnesses, is directly re- lated to the organization of society as a whole. Something mental, without doubt, holds a society together, and, having regard to the pre-eminence of mind in the human species, it is no doubt something mental which is fundamental to the cohesion of a society. But this something is certainly not alone, or even perhaps largely, the con- sciousness in its highest manifestations. "It is the greatest of mistakes,"' says White-</page><page sequence="3">48 ETHICS head, "to believe that it, has required the. high-grade intelligence of mankind to con- struct an elaborate social organization." A social organization, at any instant, is in fact a stupendous hotchpotch of all manner of actions and practices, some of which were recently thought up by various conscious- nesses and imitated by others, far more of which were invented in the distant past, the conscious reasons for them having long ago been lost. This is routine, and Whitehead, again, says: "It is the beginning of wisdom to understand that social life is founded up- on routine. Unless society is permeated, through and through, with routine, civiliza- tion vanishes."4 Anthropologists say that the mental basis of routine is custom, and the very word indicates a low grade of con- sciousness although scarcely entire absence of it, as does (perhaps wrongly) the zoolo- gists' word "instinct." The highest grade of consciousness is, however, often called in- probably still more often ought to be called in-when the simmering conflicts of differ- ent customs in the same society produce serious trouble. Indeed, civilized societies invariably develop classes of social watch- dogs, so to speak-scholars and statesmen- whose business is to watch over and try to regulate disorders in society; these ought to be persons of high-grade consciousness. Thus the actual routine of a civilized society probably contains elements whose original invention was most various, some of them truly the invention of genius, but most of them the product, both recently and long ago, of relatively stupid, unthinking adjust- ments to circumstances. If they be viewed dynamically, custom will cover the lot; that is what keeps them all going. The distinction between custom and the fuller consciousness required to alter custom is present in Kahler's argument but not in such a form as to allow due importance to custom and its effect in civilized societies, which is the point Whitehead is concerned to press. Kahler gives an interesting con- trast between the human community as it is 3 Adventures of Ideas (New York, I933), p. I 5. 4 Ibid.s p. I I4. before the "'discovery of the individual" and as it is after that discovery and imagines that the discovery is something which pro- ceeds by a linear series of steps throughout human history. This "discovery of the in- dividual" is much the same phenomenon as both Whitehead and Benedetto Croce have regarded as the attainment of freedom by the individual, but neither of those scholars was naive enough to suppose that it could be traced as a linear development through human history. In Kahler's version the dis- covery is the outcome of distinction of the non-self from the self and of "objectivation" of the self; and the community before the discovery, which he calls, somewhat un- fortunately, "species," is the primitive tribal or family community whose members came together without their own volition; the community after the discovery, which he calls "collective," is formed consciously by its members for a specific common purpose. He names a trade-union as an example of the latterand such is, no doubt, as near to an example of it as could be found. He fails to notice that, after the initial formation and extension in society of trade unions by their pioneers, entry into membership of them be- comes as much an involuntary, routine mat- ter for the individual at a certain stage in his life as, let us say, entry at a corresponding stage into the fighting group within a primi- tive society. In short, the invention of trade- unions, as of other institutions, is to be ascribed to one cause, and the routine func- tioning of these institutions is to be ascribed to another cause. Our analysis, carried to this point, would suggest that human society functions un- varyingly, on an even keel, so to speak, mainly by reason of custom; that it is moved away from this unvarying functioning by the operation of the human consciousness in some larger manner. But this does not ex- haust the causation of the functioning of human society. Professor Kahler offers a clue to another element in causation, per- haps unwittingly, in his poetically heated description of modern technologized society with its mass of collectives operating both in</page><page sequence="4">DISCUSSION 49 the machines and in the routines of the men fastened, as it were, to them. The clue is the nonhuman element here involved, animal, vegetable, inorganic-all of that sector of nature, in fact, with which the human mind has contact. This element does not cease to operate as a cause when it gets info man's hands: its multifarious traits-its "actions," as the physical scientist quite rightly calls them-are arranged according to human patterns, but they very definitely act. The operation ,of man upon his nonhuman en- vironment is, or ought and is intended to be, co-operative, the environment playing a part secondary to mans part. In the evolution of man, in fact, as of all that sector of nature which we know, there are perhaps four causal principles. Two op- erate together in some way which is, so far, very obscure to us to produce the existence of what we customarily call matter; they appear to be space and time, or at least those concepts are the nearest we have reached to knowing them.5 The-two others are duration and change: a principle which tends to keep things the -same, and a prin- ciple which tends to alter them. In the evo- lution of man these principles are related to each other in a special manner, a manner which has itself evolved and whose develop- ment is, no doubt, the ultimate analysis in terms of cause and effect-if we could but make it-of the ascent of man. The relationship, as we can discern it at the present juncture, and as it has probably endured fairly steadily at least since the emergence of the species man, appears to be as follows. The existence of matter, what- ever it is, goes on independently so far as we know and operates throughout the species and the environment. The duration princi- ple is roughly integrated under one aspect or part of man's mind which has been called custom, habit, and various other names. It will not do to rule consciousness out of this 5 I suppose it is the province of the physicist to say what these are, but what they have said so far scarcely has clear meaning, so far as I can judge. I use the terms "matter," "space," and "time," with- out prejudice, therefore, as to what they may be found to mean. entirely, but clearly it is not involved in it very largely. It is important to recognize that this principle operates throughout the entire evolutionary process: it is present in inorganic matter, tending to stabilize its "actions" and its "states"; it is present in the human physique-and physiology has shown us much about this, especially the "action" of the, ductless gland system; it is present in mind itself, this perhaps causally related to its presence in the physique gen- erally, and from this point, its headquarters, it operates directly upon the social structure by custom, and likewise upon all other spheres to effect, so far as it can, a generally harmonious continuity.6 This does not mean, of course, that the principle of duration resident in the human mind makes use only of the actions of that same principle resident in the environment; it makes use also of the principle of change but, by imposing itself upon it, converts it into repetitive change and so subdues it to the routine of human life itself. Meanwhile the principle of change itself is sovereign, resident, again, throughout species and environment, and integrated in a manner quite analogous to that of the principle of duration, but operating central- ly from the highest aspect of the human mind which has here been called the con- sciousness. In the human consciousness, as throughout the living world, the principle is 6 It seems to me quite possible that the measure of clarity with which the duration principle may still be discerned at the present juncture in the hu- man ascent marks it as a specially important evolu- tionary achievement; that there may have been a time when it was the supreme achievement. I should guess that, if there be anything in this idea at all, the achievement was fundamental to inorganic evo- lution; further that it was surpassed by the achieve- ment of the principle of change when life emerged, for the principle of change itself underwent a change at that point. This would perhaps explain those ex- tremely primitive unicellular forms of life which, to our knowledge, would appear to endure permanent- ly unchanged except for external action upon them; namely, that in them the principle of change, though already organized in the form of growth characteris- tic of life, is so small and obscure that our methods of investigation have not yet shown its presence. Note that I use the term "emergence" without mystical connotation.</page><page sequence="5">50 ETHICS so formed as to be a principle of growth or increase. It is of the greatest significance to the history of mankind that the conscious- ness, perhaps in virtue of the fact that it extends down part-way into the mental mechanism of custom, is, or should be, su- perior to custom, so that the principle of change is superimposed upon the principle of duration in this supreme sphere of the hu- man evolutionary ascent. Ideally, the consciousness ought to hold both causal principles throughout its entire environment in complete functional har- mony. But this is not how history works, at least not the history of man. Actually, the history of every human society is the story of a gradual, but not very steady, rather spasmodic, spatial extension of harmony by the consciousness, an extension both quanti- tative and qualitative. This is true so long as the society progresses; when it ceases to be true, the society retrogresses. Kahler's picture of the contemporary Western Society, by the special emphasis he throws, has the merit of drawing attention to the conflict which can ensue in a certain historical phase (or more than one phase perhaps) between the consciousness and custom, between change and duration. Obviously, the con- flict is intrinsic and endemic in society and throughout nature. Yet Kahler's argument shows that it can be more critical at some times than at others. When a human society is simple and small-relatively small in population and territory as well as in in- volvement in its harmony of other parts of the environment-the task of directing it upward must be a lesser one and conscious- ness is less heavily taxed. In later phases, and especially in the climactic phase of fullest development of the society, the very measure of harmonious system which the consciousness has previously inseminated in the society imparts a tremendous power to custom and so renders that much the greater the task of making those further changes which must be made if the system is to become greater yet qualitatively and quantitatively. Then, indeed, is the society an immense, yet unfinished and still in- ternally conflicting, mechanism such that the wit of man may be unable to continue improving it, and its inner conflicts may destroy it; custom, divided against itself, may gain the upper hand and bring down the society in ruin. In those great crises the fullest resources of consciousness are re- quired, in quantity and quality, as at no other times. This means, to emerge from ab- straction, that the highest intelligence is necessary in as many members of the so- ciety as possible; and it means, too, that there must be agreement, co-operation, be- tween as many as possible. Ideally again, all men must be free and of one mind, intelli- gent and fully persuaded of a single policy and determined to pursue it. And this, of course, has never happened. Kahler's picture of contemporary West- ern Society, valuable in one way, is mislead- ing in another, as is the rest of his book which leads up to it. A crisis such as he discerns (though whether we really are yet at the great crisis is open to much doubt) has happened not once but many times; the history of man is not a linear progress. The technology of our society has, of course, its particular significance in history, but it is not in terms of basic causation. It is a mat- ter of large quantitative extension of the human evolutionary harmony into the non- human environment-whether qualitative also is a nice question upon which the reader may be left to speculate. Every other so- ciety also has had its quantitative extension of the harmony into the nonhuman environ- ment; our Western Society differs from oth- ers here only in degree. In all societies cau- sality has existed in human consciousness, human custom, and in "matter." In the present crisis, if it really is one, and in every other through which man has passed hither- to conflicting custom has triumphed, con- sciousness failed, and the society has dis- integrated. This is the major theme so far of the history of mankind. II Enlargement of the human conscious- ness, in itself by acquisition of objective</page><page sequence="6">DISCUSSION 5I knowledge, and in action by extension of harmony in its environment, is the key as- pect of the growth phase of a society, the direct effect of its major cause. The former part of the process, the acquisition of ob- jective knowledge, is for Kahler the dis- cernment and detachment of the non-self from the self. He thinks it is dual: the in- dividual gradually distinguishes himself from the human species, on the one hand, and, on the other, himself and the species from the "universe." There' are, in fact, three entities in the individual's world when that world has been fully discovered to him: individual, humanity, and universe. That full discovery, according to Kahler, is an event which has already happened-difficult as this may seem to the critical reader! Our author assigns as the approximate date of the event the general establishment of Christianity. It is necessary to give special consideration to this supposedly dual pro- cess of objectivation. What is the "universe"? Hugh Miller has recently remarked that we know nothing of any universe.7 As has been said above, what we know is a sector of nature, the sector with which, directly or indirectly, our sen- ses make contact: that is our "world." It is not a fixed quantity-at any rate not yet. It has expanded conspicuously during the history of many growing human' societies. One of the main occupations of conscious- ness is its expansion. The "universe," is merely a subjective projection of our sector of nature upon an infinite scale-a sort of inflation of what we know. But to ask wheth- er the projection gives the whole of nature correctly or with an error due to our fac- tor of ignorance; to ask whether nature is infinite or not, and what a projection upon an infinite scale does to the quantities and qualities involved in the operation: these questions are 'meaningless, for we do not know objectively of anything which is in- finite. Infinity, as far as we know, is a purely subjective concept of the human mind; we conceive it as an abstraction, but we cannot 7 History and Scienc&amp; (Berkeley, Calif., I939), P. 35. imagine it. It is a product of consciousness operating in the purest sphere of reason, mathematics-exceedingly useful and' im- portant, but having no reality other than mathematical. When we try to project it in- to physics, it behaves in a most troublesome manner, as anyone can see who observes the antics of some mathematical physicists of the present generation. If we choose to project infinity into our known sector of nature for any purpose, physical, philosophical, sociological, it is equally unruly and will fill the resulting "universe" with nothing but subjective con- cepts. It was George Bernard Shaw who re- marked that Man made God in his own image-and Sir James Jeans, not perhaps fully aware who it was that enunciated that thesis, deduced with impeccable logic that God must be a mathematician! Nevertheless, Kahler is correct in sup- posing that man discovered a universe. In- deed, he did so not only at the establishment of Christianity but on dozens of other oc- casions also, and, if it was a different uni- verse on each occasion, they all had a certain family likeness, being fathered by human consciousness. He is quite wrong, however, in supposing that man thereby objectivated anything, that he/took a step in distinguish- ing the non-self from the self; on the con- trary, whenever man discovered a new uni- verse, the self stole a march on him, and his consciousness was in danger of losing its evolutionary dominance. Infinity serves in mathematics rather 'like the wall in hand- ball, with the important difference that, when a mathematical quantity is thrown against infinity, it rebounds without any loss of energy whatsoever. A mathematical entity, unlike a natural entity, can endure unchanged in time and can be absolutely identical with other mathematical entities, whereas, so far as we know, absolute identi- ty does not exist in nature. When the uni- verse is introduced into nature, all con- cepts of supposed natural entities and quali- ties which are affected by it become mathe- maticized; they become anthropomorphic. The less objectively known data in any such</page><page sequence="7">52 ETHICS particular entity, the more anthropomorph- ic it is; the more objectively known data, the les? anthropomorphic; but the infinitude of a universe, being infinite, must, if logic is used, affect all entities in nature, so that the well-known position is readily reached wherein things are not as they seem: they haye substance or essence which, like in- finity, is unknown and, as some rightly think, unknowable. What, then, is known? This question inevitably arises, and it may be answered by a system of subjective phi- losophy in which it becomes more and more difficult to discover whether anything really is known, or it may be answered by sheer skepticism. Action in a world of either kind becomes divorced from thought; man no longer knows what is real and what is not and rapidly loses his grip on things. Thus Kahler is greatly to be praised for his discernment that man gains control of his world by objectivating it, but he made an immoderate blunder in thinking that the concept of a universe is objective. On the contrary it is the lapse back toward primi- tive "participation," which has occurred many times in man's history. The blunder, suYely, arose out of ,the notion of Geist, which still haunts German thought so much more obtrusively than other Western thought, for is not Geist merely the basis of animism surviving into an era which be- lieved it had escaped into self-consciousness? If, however, the universe notion witnesses to successive failures of objectivity, it is otherwise with the concept of humanity, and in recognizing the attainment of this concept as an important landmark-reached and forgotten indeed many times in man's history-Kahler enters a great company of thinkers, of whose contemporary represent- atives perhaps Whitehead and Arnold J. Toynbee are the greatest.8 It is an objective fact that mankind has a common quality, which means, initially and basically, simply that all men are biologically similar. The consequences of this idea are, however, of 8 Failure or refusal to perceive this in principle differentiates these men from such as Bergson, Spengler, and Nietzsche and his various followers. great import, for the idea is a necessary stage in man's establishment of his domi- nance over his sector of nature-of the im- parting of order to that sector by man's con- sciousness. Unless the entire species co- operates in this immense task, it is scarcely likely to be accomplished. But the co-opera- tion of man-willing and enthusiastic co- operation upon which basis alone maximum use of the natural resources of every man can be assured-is not at all easy to reach. The first difficulty, which man has never yet overcome, is to persuade all men of the need for co-operation. Many have believed it absolutely impossible so to persuade all men and have ascribed this to the inferior mental development of many men; the great company of the Stoics became con- vinced that "the masses are incapable of philosophy." Whether or not the Stoic statement of the problem uses correct premises, the assumption that it is forever insoluble implies that some men are bio- logically less than human.9 The true relation of the concept of hu- manity and that of the universe in human history would seem to be this: that failure to transform the idea of general human co- operation into a fact has led on to the con- cept of the universe-to operations in vacuo, that is to say. Man, having conceived of a united humanity and failed to put it into effect, has turned aside from the task into a subjective unreality, as he has also done in so many other, lesser tasks'he has failed to accomplish.Io Hence the fact that so-called universal religions have in human history followed so-called universal states, all of which latter, to date, have failed. (The sub- stance of their failure was not only, be it 9 We have no final warrant at present for reject- ing this thesis. The concept of species is left some- what doubtfulby the studies of Richard Gold- schmidt (see The Material Basis of Evolution [New Haven, I940] ) So that it becomes possible that Homo sapiens does not after all denote a group of animals sufficiently similar to act in common agree- ment. My view of this problem is, however, that, species or not, all men can share enough knowledge to reach agreement-harmony of different action. IO Witness again contemporary physics.</page><page sequence="8">DISCUSSION 53 noted, that they did not include all of hu- manity but also-and probably this is of vastly greater importance-that those they did include were included too much under compulsion, were not sufficiently freely co- operating.) Hence again the fact that most universal religions set man himself in "heav- en," there living a better and freer life than he lives in the universal state. The danger of forgetting or confusing the boundary be- tween the subjective and the objective is that, supposing "heaven" is an objective reality; then there is no longer any real need for the effort to realize human freedom and unity on earth. The resort to subjective heavens is, in fact, the resort of the con- sciousness when it has definitely failed in the actual environment, and custom is left to lead man by its several conflicting courses to disaster. It is possible that these lapses of the human consciousness into the uncon- sciously subjective are analogous to the phenomenon of overspecialization, supposed by biologists to have been fatal to the sur- vival or to the continuing evolution of some species. III It has now been necessary several times to point out that what Kahler thinks are steps in a single, linear development of hu- man history are in fact steps which have been repeated many times. With little doubt the worst feature of Kahler's interpretation of history is the fact that he ignores most of history; yet that is a merciful rather than a just comment upon him, for; ignoring a part of human history entirely, he distorts an- other part. Let it be said at once, however, that, if his treatment of ancient history, which is distorted, be set aside, and if the lack of satisfactory conclusion to his work also be forgiven, his interpretation of the history of Western Society is a highly valu- able one. That interpretation has certainly made clear some parts of the process which were not clear before, and, in the hands of competent judges (not, I am afraid, 'in other hands), this part of his work should be a permanent asset to thought. The history of mankind is certainly not. as Kahler says, a roughly linear progress from savagery through the ancient societies of the Near East, the Greco-Roman Society, to the Western Society, with unimportant side issues, signifying and contributing little to human evolution, in China and India. Instead it is, so far as my understanding of it carries me, the history of about twenty, possibly somewhat fewer, major civilized societies, and of thousands of what may col- lectively be called "precivilized" societies. These are related to one another in several, perhaps many, different ways: some civi- lized societies in pairs or larger groups abut upon one another chronologically and geo- graphically (in space and time, that is) and so causally; some engulf others, with strange results; every civilized society to date, in- cluding those arising causally out of one or more earlier civilized societies, has caught up within itself from its inception many pre- civilized societies so that a civilized society through at any rate a part of its existence is really a symbiosis of the civilized with vari- ous precivilized social principles (from this many contrasts which have perplexed his- torians and anthropologists). Every civi- lized society to date has passed through a series of phases which show a broad corre- spondence with the phases through which all other civilized societies have passed, this notwithstanding a great distortion of the pattern of succession of phases by contacts and minglings of the cultures of different societies",-far more distortion than has been admitted by any of those who have, so far, used the cyclic interpretation. The cor- respondence of phases, though still rough and broad, is much clearer in the develop- "I So great in a number of cases is the distortion that I had not considered the broad correspondence sufficiently proved until the appearance of P. A. Sorokin's Social and Cultural Dynamics (4 vols.; New York: American Book Co., I937-4I). In spite of grave defects (see critique by Coulborn and Du- Bois in Journal of Modern History, XIV, 500-52I), that work is, in my opinion, a conclusive argument to the effect that, while a cyclic process continues, it must follow a certain very broadly similar series of phases (which is not perhaps quite the conclusion Sorokin intended).</page><page sequence="9">54 ETHICS Xnent of conscious thought than in the out- ward sphere of institutions and policies. This statement is, of course, a statement of the cyclic view of history, or, as Kahler justifiably prefers to call it, the spiral view of history. Although there are some pre- cursors, the first clear statement of it was that of Giambattista Vico. It has had many variants since then, plenty of them fantastic. Probably the best to date is Arnold J. Toynbee's A Study of History-this in spite of many defects on the rational side, some on the empirical side, of the analysis. It would, of course, be quite impossible here to prove-to demonstrate the probable truth of-the cyclic view of history. That would take several volumes, since it can be done only empirically and in extenso. i2 I can say here only that, so far as I am able to un- derstand history, I do not know how any other interpretation can today be enter- tained by a serious scholar. To reject the cyclic interpretation on the ground that some of its advocates fall into various kinds of mysticism, or simply into large blunders, is to confess to a failure to separate the em- pirical evidence from the meaning assigned to it. Spengler's mysticism consists in mis- placing the deterministic principle, making it resident, in some manner he does not ex- plain-nor could anybody-in the cycles themselves; the doctrine when carefully ex- amined is merely without meaning. Toyn- bee's mysticism, confused and inconsistent with itself, is a relative of Kahler's "spirit," of the transcendental instead of the im- manent variety. Some, but not all, of those who interpret history in cycles think the cycles must go on forever; apparently they fail to notice the simple, mathematical truth that such an argument also implies that they have already in the past been going on for- ever! But the very variety of these notions is reason enough to compel any serious stu- denf of history to investigate the facts for himself in order to discover what there is in 12I hope to produce one such volume, offering evidence from a part of human history, before long. The opinions put forward in this essay give a pre- view of the doctrine arising from that partial study. them to bring thinkers of such vastly dif- ferent prejudices to the same opinion about the repetitive pattern of occurrence of the facts. It is evident that Kahler has not in- vestigated the facts extensively enough, for the reason that within the chronological limits of his own careful investigations his opinions fall completely into the class of those of the advocates of the cyclic view. His account of the history of the Western Society is in all essentials that given by Toynbee, Spengler, Sorokin, and others. In some particulars I prefer him to any of them -examples: his account (pp. 254-73) of the struggle of reason with "revealed truth" in medieval philosophy, in which even the meaning he assigns to the phenomenon is, in my opinion, very largely correct; his ac- count (pp. 405-7) of the conflict of ideolo- gies between different states in modern times, in which, while I should give a differ- ent explanation of the individual ideologies, I fully accept the view that this conflict, rather than any surface material issues, is fundamental; his account (pp. 465-66) of the transition from Christian values to "secular" values in thought, in which I should dispute only the absoluteness of the contrast implied between "secular" and "religious" or "Christian."13 A closer in- vestigation of the history of other civilized societies would, however, have shown Kah- ler that similar phenomena to these have occurred in each of them. The first and last examples above are closely connected and form, in fact, a single process; a process similar to this occurred in -Greek thought, some of the facts of which are given by Kahler himself without, apparently, any awareness on his part of the similarity. A similar process again may be discerned in the controversies during the early dynasties of the First Egyptian Society (origins to the breakdown after the VI Dynasty),I4 etc. A '3 See below, pp. 6o-6i.

Accordingly, the terms "First," "Second," and "Third" are used here.</page><page sequence="10">DISCUSSION 55, close parallel to our contemporary conflict of ideologies is to be found in the Second Chinese Society (Chou to Posterior Han dynasties) in and after Confucius' time- the "Hundred Schools," which were, in fact, some three or four main "schools" or ide- ologies; and, again, there are many other parallels. Had Kahler carried his investigations in this direction, he might have avoided such appalling schoolboy "boners" as: "It is not surprising that in the numerous preserved documents of these peoples [those of the societies of the ancient Near East] there is no individual note, no characteristic ac- count of events or persons" (p. 55). He would then not have been under the neces- sity of alluding obscurely to such a docu- ment as the Dialogue of a Misanthrope with His Soul in order to say specifically that he does not think it contains any "individual note"-a very crude device for disarming the opposition. He would not have needed to sneer at the-admittedly foolish-contro- versies of the Egyptologists and Assyriolo- gists as to whether Egypt or Babylon was the greater, only to fall himself into a larger foolishness by grossly exaggerating the originality of the Hebrews in the face of steadily mounting evidence of their debt to both of their predecessors. There is more ex- cuse, in the matter of quantity and avail- ability of evidence, for his failure to judge of how much was new in the Greek city polities; nevertheless, he gives away his doubts of his own professed views by strenu- ous arguments wherever possible to mini- mize the importance of commerce in other, earlier city systems. The Greek cities, it would appear, had to be assigned a special significance in order that they might be compared with modern commercial com- munities-a real comparison, I 'believe, and one of the few Kahler notices. But the sig- nificance of i the two things compared, both for the Greco-Roman Society and for our own Western Society, would have been dif- ferent if Kahler had admitted to himself and his readers that there are far more than two examples of this kind of commer- cial development-something he, obviously feared was the case. Other important parallels he misses al- together. One of these is that of the "lonely individual" in the latter days of the Roman Empire and the "lost individuality" of the man of today. With this, as with all other parallels between the course of development of different societies, it is, of course, first necessary-and important-to recognize the parallelism. But that operation is rather the elementary operation, and, if it be the only operation, as it has been in several cyclic interpretations of history, it leads to noth- ing more than the simple conclusion that there are repetitive cycles in history. (Often enough those who have reached that simple conclusion have then laid aside their em- pirical material and taken a flying leap into their own particular nostrums.) The further and more instructive operation is the search for differences-variations in aspect or de- tail or whatnot between phenomena gen- erally the same. So, in my opinion, the lone- ly individual of the late Roman Empire is certainly a fact, and Kahler is to be con- gratulated upon noticing him; but his loneli- ness is his alienation from the culture and the society, and consequent upon it is the impending doom of the society when lonely individuals have become numerous. Toyn- bee has, of course, seen this quite clearly in his concept of the "internal proletariat" alienated from the culture.'5 Now, there were lonely individuals in the Greco-Roman Society at a much earlier time; perhaps they were then neither so lonely nor so numerous. Yet it would seem that in Hellenistic times and in the days just before the Macedonian conquests there were Greek citizens, caught up in the intellectual, commercial, military, and other activities of their world, to whom those activities can have had little meaning or else a confusion of conflicting meanings. It is they who resemble the man of today, caught up in the activities of what Kahler calls the various "collectives." The reader I5 But I do not accept Toynbee's opinion of the monopoly of "creativity" held by his two pro- letariats as against his "dominant minority."</page><page sequence="11">56 ETHICS can, no doubt, develop the meaning of this comparison further for himself. Kahler's notion that lonely individuals happened for the first and last time in the late days of the Roman Empire would really be laughable if it were not so important a point in his utterly spurious linear develop- ment of the discovery of the individual. It is, in fact, the turning-point of his argument, for, as mentioned already, he thinks that before then the discovery was proceeding, and that afterward occurred the active tran- scendence of the individual in the growth of "collectives." The introduction of White- head's opinion in Part I above showed that the growth of collectives is nothing like such a simple process as Kahler thinks, while in Part II above it was shown that the con- sciousness, when it fails in its earthly task, may take refuge in a nonexistent universe or heaven. The lonely individual is one who at least embarks upon his active life with a highly developed consciousness affording him a wide objectivation of his world, a sharp dis- tinction between non-self and self-so sharp, indeed, that his emotions become col- lected about the contrast between the two, their incompatibility. Kahler is perfectly correct in thinking that such an individual rejects and turns away from the real world he knows, but he is in error in thinking that he feels alone before the "universe"; it is the real world that appalls him, and he seeks refuge in a "universe" which accords better with his own subjective feelings; he turns in upon himself and loses his objectivity. I have said above that these recurrent crises in human history are the great failures of the consciousness; for the time being they wreck knowledge. But they are not failures only of the moments in which they occur: they sum up a series of failures, the accumu- lation of errors in the knowledge of the so- ciety which finally outweigh the truth in that knowledge in the judgment both of truth and of -error made by the individual. Thus the rejection of the real world begins as a reasonable act of thought, and the sub- sequent lapse back into the confusion of subjectivity is that kind of, wrong which, added to another wrong, offers opportunity eventually for achieving a right. The final justification of setting up a subjective heav- en is the justification of scrapping worn-out ideas, the true with the false, because they cannot be distinguished from one another; there is then the possibility that by the long travail of creating a new culture a better world may eventually be objectivated and actualized out of the new subjective heaven. To resolve these events in terms of the abstract causal analysis of Part I above: the real world as it appears to the conscious mind of the disgruntled individual is the imperfectly harmonized effect of cumulative causes which have operated progressively throughout the history of the society both in species and in environment; they have op- erated up to this time under supreme direc- tion of the consciousness itself using the pri- mary principle of change, but custom, using the secondary causal principle of duration, has taken its almost equal part in opposition to the principle of change. At this crucial juncture of alienation of the individual, cus- tom takes the lead and surpasses the higher consciousness, which, actuating the individu- al, now revolts against the evolutionary trend of the real world, leaving it to the de- struction which iinevitably supervenes upon an imperfect system following contradictory routines. The imperfection of the system is endemic in varying degrees throughout the society, marking the failures of the con- sciousness to accomplish its evolutionary task of instilling harmony, and it extends into the realm of consciousness itself. In this realm the general 'breakdown also oc- curs, and herein consists the isolation of the individual from other individuals, the def- initive disruption of that incomplete unity between individual consciousnesses which had formerly endured. A working measure of agreement upon the objects of life must continue between all men in a civilized so- ciety if that society is to continue to grow. To select a series of events over the whole history of mankind and relate them to one another in terms of their differences of meaning for the self-consciousness and ob- jectivating power of the individual is valid</page><page sequence="12">DISCUSSION 57 scientific procedure only if their similarities of meaning for the same end are also con- sidered; the latter logically come first, the former second. This logic actually dictates the mode of selection, compelling search, first of all, for important events most closely similar; only as events are connected in order of decreasing similarity do the emerg- ing differences have meaning grounded in empiricalfact. To select in accordance with a preconceived scheme in the scholar's own imagination, as Kahler has done, will give nothing whatsoever about the empirical course of history; it will merely reflect the scholar's imagination, imparting to his sub- jective thought a spurious justification. Perhaps Kahler's preconceived scheme of history gives a more encouraging view of the measure of success to date of the con- sciousness in its evolutionary task than the empirical facts give. Perhaps a future his- tory in accordance with Kahler's gospel would be better for mankind and for nature than the actual past history has been. Gos- pels of this kind are becoming, though not yet numerous, of more frequent occurrence than they were. They are, I think, the work of individuals with a very sharp sense of their individuality, a very sharp sense of all individuality such that for them individual events may be detached from their factual and logical contexts-must be so detached in order that they may fit into a better and prophetic world of subjective theory to re-_ place~the actual world of objective fact. I do not presume to repudiate this procedure ex- cept for myself but merely to say that, if it be done, it should be done only with full knowledge and frank acknowledgment of what it is. And it is, of course, art, not sci- ence, and should be so declared. Kahler should have said: this is not history, not reality, but it is meaningfully related to history; if history had been thus, it would have been better. IV Such clarity and frankness would have led to an equally clear conclusion, which is lacking in Kahler's book. As it stands, the whole book integrally is a conclusion: it is Kahler's personal conclusion upon what his- tory might have been and would have been if other men had been more like himself than they were. It will be possible by de- velopment of doctrine constructed here to supply an objective conclusion. It has been stated, not proved, that the history of mankind has moved, since man first attained civilization, in cycles; every civilized society has constituted one cycle. The transition from one cycle to another and the growth process of all cycles have been examined from several angles, and it has been shown that growth is dominated by two causal principles-that of change and that of routine continuity (with two other principles underlying them)-and that the effect of these principles is to increase the collective scope and volume of the so- ciety. At the transition there is a definitive rupture of the growth relationship between change and continuity: the human con- sciousness, which directs change, cuts adrift from custom, the individual from society, and the old society collapses, leaving the consciousness to begin a new cycle of ob- jectivation after lapse into subjectivity. We are concerned in particular with two issues: the meaning and future result of the cyclical process of history and the position in its cycle of our own contemporary West- ern Society. To throw a little light upon these issues it will not be essential to investi- gate all phases of historical cycles but rather to concentrate attention upon the climactic phase. Kahler's own account of the earlier phases of our own society's history is valua- ble, the most valuable part of his book, and, if between those past phases and the cli- mactic phase presumptively to come the present lies somewhat indeterminate (and will continue to do so after this investigation is concluded), that is inevitable because the determination of the future lies in part with those inhabiting the present.'6 As to the ulti- i6 The aspects of the future we can foretell in so far as we know history are those which were deter- mined before our time. Yet these are not concrete, for our own present contribution must also enter into concretion, and we do not know ourselves. We sometimes think we know ourselves, but this knowl- edge is purely subjective and is beyond our ability</page><page sequence="13">58 ETHICS mate meaning of historical cycles, it does not emerge from our present and our own so- ciety any more than from others but rather from seeing history whole and in its biologi- cal evolutionary context. If there is any truth in the interpretation of history used here, it follows of necessity that the growth in extension and complexity of routine which is the outward aspect of the growth of a society results from a growth in extension and complexity of ideas. Through- out this history the consciousness is, or ought to be, seeking to increase the harmony of that extending complexity. In all past so- cieties, to my knowledge, real increase of that harmony is effected as the climax ap- proaches in spite of quantitative increase of knowledge and through and by means of in- creasing complexity. This is the most im- pressive achievement of man. Finally, there emerges a body of knowledge striving to be a unified philosophy but never to date fully succeeding. (With this goes, of course, the formation of the "universal state.") It is evident in history that a unified philosophy which is merely crammed down the individ- ual's throat by force is of no avail to its pur- pose. This is, of course, the formula of the Nazis, to mention no other contemporaries. It defeats itself, as was shown most clearly in China when it was tried by Ch'in Shih Huang Ti. There are many other historical examples of the use of force to this end, and they vary much in intensity. None of them endures long, however, and their historic significance is the great urgency of unifica- tion of ideas together with the possibly still greater urgency to extend those ideas into as many minds as possible including the minds of quite humble persons. I venture, therefore, the suggestion that there are two criteria by Which a climactic philosophy may be judged: how true a sys- tematization of the total current knowledge it is and how deeply and broadly it can pene- trate the minds of all individual members of to objectivate it in itself, let alone to integrate it with objective knowledge of the past and to foresee the future whole and concrete. the society. It is clear that between these two criteria there is an antinomy, and yet it is, in my opinion, one of the great lessons of history, that the stability and durability of the collectivism toward which every past civilized society has evolved depend upon the two. Beyond them lie the quantity- quality of the knowledge itself and the men- tal ability of the human stock composing the society. Eugenists will say, no doubt, that the solution of both problems is to "breed for brains," and it may be so;'but it is also true that brains in high development are required beforehand in the people it is proposed to persuade to breed for brains- the quality of mind necessary to pursue a personal eugenic policy is already a very high one. The evidence of history about philoso- phies which have actually flourished in the climactic phases of civilized societies is that they\begin relatively well and then deterio- rate. There are a few flimsy theories about the quality of the mental stock in those phases, and they point also to deterioration, but those theories are not such as may be used in serious studies. It is necessary, there- fore, to use the surer evidence of the philoso- phies alone. The best known case is the Greco-Roman; and this shows Stoicism as the leading philosophy, with Cynicism and Epicureanism competing, in the earlier and better part of the climactic period. The fact that there are these three unreconciled, or little reconciled, schools, not to mention minor ones, shows that there was a grave defect of systematization. There may be many truths, but they must all be integra- ble. All these philosophies degenerated, and there came a later period in which Neopla- tonism was predominant, and worse fol- lowed that. A similar, but somewhat differ- ent, course occurred in the Second Chinese Society. Han Confucianism (so called to dis- tinguish it from Confucius' own far superior doctrine before the climactic period) en- joyed a period of uneasy ascendance, but it came comparatively late and was already much debased. The earlier prevalence of Taoism and Fa Chia occurred within such</page><page sequence="14">DISCUSSION 59 restricted circles (except in so far as Shih Huang Ti enforced conformity to Fa Chia) as to advertise emphatically both the failure of any considerable measure of unity and the difficulty of popularizing- serious thought. The First Egyptian Society, so far as the scanty evidence shows, achieved an impor- tant philosophy, that expounded in the Memphite Drama, early in its collective phase. Debasements and corruptions fol- lowed, and from the fact that they all appear to descend from the one source we may be justified in supposing a good measure of unity of system. General knowledge about the society makes it clear, however, that thought flourished only in a very restricted circle. Why and how do the great philosophies decline? As several partial answers to these questions have been suggested above, it may not be too misleading to attempt an- swers now in general terms. The decline ap- pears to originate in the very process of uni- fication by which those philosophies are compiled: they have to include bodies of doctrine based upon different epistemolo- gies, any one of which knits together the special knowledge to which it is relevant, none of. which serves satisfactorily for all knowledge possessed by the society; rarely, if ever, has a single epistemological basis of real working value been evolved.I7 As a re- sult this central problem is, as a rule, un- solved, and, as, we have seen, competing philosophies continue to exist. But this problem does not by any means end with such higher thought as is customarily called philosophy. The inclusiveness needed must allow also for the simple ideas of "unthink- ing" people. If it does not, thought fails to serve one of its two purposes-that of im- parting fundamental unity to society (the other being to give effective contact with the environment). Ironically, it appears that the weakening of epistemological and experimental criteria in the process of at.- tempted unification of systems - actually I7 The case of the First Egyptian Society may be such a rare case, but the evidence is nothing like enough to give a large probability that it was. facilitates the entry into them of ill-thought- out ideas of nonscientific origin. Through- out the whole process greater degrees of unity are attained by sacrifices of quality of truth. In the end the masses drag thought down to their own level. Thus in earlier stages of unification ob- jectivity tends to be lost, since there are sev- eral conflicting objectivities. In the teeth of resulting skepticism there is movement to- ward subjectivity, which tends more and more to become unconscious; it is here that reliance upon the "universe," or upon some still more nebulous collectivity, comes to be heavy. This is confusion between actual knowledge and imaginative theoretical structures set up to fill gaps in knowledge; other constructs, at first fairly rational per- haps, follow the universe and find their place in it: the typical Neo-Pythagorean position ensues. But the universe will ex- pand to accommodate anything and every- thing-gods, spirits, demons, other worlds, miracles-and it does so. In a sense, what is happening is that thought is struggling to keep abreast of events-and failing more and more to do so.. Traditional practices must be preserved in order that the social structure shall continue to function, but they must be modified and also "rational- ized," in the pejorative sense of that term, in order to fit them into the complex struc- ture of the society with an attempt at har- mony. Truth is sacrificed again and again to expediency. Custom operates indefatiga- bly an insufficiently harmonious aggrega- tion of ideas, and fully conscious thought loses its ability to change, improve, and cor- rect in the desperate struggle to patch to- gether concepts which will serve for the moment to stave off meaninglessness. What began as systematic philosophy ends as conglomerate myth or, as the usual term is, "religion." If there is a fundamental distinction be- tween philosophy and religion, it lies in the act of faith. Every philosophy is founded upon faith and must be because the incom- plete knowledge of nature which man has had throughout his history forces him to do</page><page sequence="15">6o ETHICS some guessing. If, then, the term "philoso- phy" means anything as applied to a sys- tem of thought, it means that faith is based upon the evidence of the senses and strictly logical structures thereupon-in short, upon as little guessing as possible. But there has never been a perfect system of this kind, and, in so far as faith is based elsewhere, a philosophy does not differ from a religion. Historically the one is continuous with the other. It is true that the passage from the one to the other is sometimes marked by revolutionary changes, but- the importance of these has, in my opinion, been grossly exaggerated; indeed, such changes result as often from superficial political conjunctions as from developments inhering deeply in thought itself. This was 'the case with the re- placement in ascendancy by Christianity of the various competing cults of the late Greco-Roman Society, and it was so, too, with the replacement by the Marduk cult of the Enlil cult in the late Sumerian Society. And in both cases the beginning of the move- ment (further) away from a scientific basis of faith antedates -by centuries the revolu- tionary changes. But what is most impor- tant in this connection is that at no time in the history of any civilized human society to date has serious thought been based ex- clusively upon observation and reason. The change from what is customarily called re- ligion to what is customarily called philoso- phy-or, still less scientifically, from faith to reason-has hitherto been excluded from this essay. It must now be introduced in or- der to deal with the second issue here re- quiring elucidation, namely, the -present position of our Western Society. Kahler speaks of the "secularization" of thought in the sixteenth and subsequent centuries of our era as if it were (a) a com- plete break with religion and (b) an ab- solutely novel event in history. By contrast he talks of thought in other societies as hav- ing been completely dominated, throughout their evolution, by religion. The contention in relation to Western Society is based upon a factitious categorization with a historic, not a logical basis: this basis is merely the division -between theology and philosophy first made in the medieval European univer- sities, and it was due to nothing more funda- mental than the difficulty experienced by the church in reconciling "revealed truth" with Aristotle's logic. Kahler is familiar enough with Greek thought to have seen the close similarity of the transition from the old "religious" to the new "philosophical" beliefs in the sixth to fifth centuries B. C. That transition is, if a quantitative state- ment be warranted, as great as the transi- tion made in Western thought from the sys- tem of Thomas Aquinas to that of Descartes, and the Greek transition was analyzed long ago by CornfordI8 in precisely the same manner as Kahler himself now analyzes the Western transition, namely, as the emer- gence of certain abstract principles of thought out of personalized principles identified with various deities, groups of deities, spirits, etc. The important upshot is that our supposed "secular" thought still contains plenty of "religion"-plenty of that subjective projection of the human self into environment; we still have a uni- verse, at least we had until yesterday and in all except a very few contemporary sys- tems; we still have God in many systems, and, though he has become very pale in most, wherever he is still found his presence indicates a vestigial survival of anthropo- morphism. As for the objective reality of the Cartesian basis of modern science, White- head has shot it to pieces (without, I sub- mit, offering more than a highly doubtful substitute). In the present organization and quantity of knowledge, I should be prepared to defy anybody to offer a substantiated opinion as to whether there is a closer qualitative ap- proach to objective truth in our realist or pragmatist systems of today, in the system of Confucius and Mencius, or in the systems of Plato and Aristotle. The idea that we have cut adrift from "religion" for the first time in history is quite chimerical; the ob- jectivation- of thought has reached a high i8 From Religion to Philosophy (London, I9I2), esp. pp. 40 ff.</page><page sequence="16">DISCUSSION 6i degree, so that it is comparable with other systems which also did so; but it is a matter of degree only. And those societies (or some of them) which Kahler thinks were com- pletely dominated by religion merely achieved a lesser degree of objectivation. It is to be noted that the two comparisons offered above are both comparisons from so- cieties in a phase before unification of thought (or of institutions) had really be- gun; it was, in both cases, not far off in the future. The same may be true of our own- society, but the need for collectivization, which appears to be the conclusion of Kah- ler's entire thesis, if it may be said to have a conclusion, is perfectly obvious and un- enlightening. The great question is what sort of collectivization, how good a unifica- tion of thought, we can achieve. It is true enough that we must correlate and har- monize our "autonomous" sciences which run off further and further each in its own specialist direction and pay little attention to their own need for submission to a unify- ing and guiding philosophy (until, like physics, they hit a stone wall). But this had already been pointed out a good deal more amply and cogently by Whitehead, to men- tion no others. Supposing that we do proceed with uni- fication of our thought-and there are steps already being taken in this direction (Kah- ler's theory is one)-there is nothing in the contemporary scene to suggest that we have escaped or shall escape from the cyclic or spiral process. The profusion of our differ- ent schools of thought suggests that unifica- tion will be as difficult as it has been in any other society, much more difficult than in most. Nietzsche, Bergson, Pareto, Ortega y Gasset, and others reproduce, in one mode or another, the opinion that "the masses are incapable of philosophy." We have, on the other hand, no reason to believe that they are not capable of religion; this they recently demonstrated in Fiihrer-worship. And, since they must be included, they may well cap- ture thought in the end and bring it down to their own level. Can we discern-even dimly-the mean- ing of this apparent cyclic nemesis? I think we can begin to do so. There is, in my opin- ion, every reason for thinking that it will not go on forever-whatever "forever" means. It means nothing in our objective human experience so that, if we wish to think ob- jectively at all, we had better attempt to do so without the forever concept. Our knowl- edge of our human sector of nature gives no phenomena which go on forever, no repeti- tions whatsoever which are absolutely iden- tical. There are plenty of cyclic or spiral phenomena, but they all begin from some- thing else and lead into something else again. If the history of our human societies has fallen into a spiral process, the probability is that it will fall, or mount, out of it again. Our human historical evolution is the story of the emergence, by ordinary biological specialization and selection, of the human consciousness, and the operation of the con- sciousness as supreme cause of the human evolutionary ascent, more powerful than the sum of all causes opposing it. This new nat- ural product, the human consciousness, is subject to natural selection like every other invention of nature. What it must do to survive, and to cause its species to survive, is to establish a definitive and stable domi- nance over the sector of nature with which it has contact. There is nothing new in bio- logical principle here; the only novelty is one of degree-the broad extension of the environmental contact of the human con- sciousness. The dominance to be established is one of ordered system such that every- thing within the sector will be harmonized in its existence and development with every- thing else. In the language of physics the human consciousness, with the general human physique, and thereafter all nature within the sector of contact, must meet, equal, and reverse the second law of thermodynamics; in the lan- guage of biology (which we are using in the main for the moment) the human conscious- ness and species must establish a stable rela- tionship with the environment; in the language of the social sciences (which has been used here, in the main, in inquiring into human history) it would seem a reasonable deduction</page><page sequence="17">62 ETHICS from our discussion above that the human consciousness must acquire complete knowl- edge of the sector of nature with which it has contact,'9 must completely harmonize this knowledge, and that its systematic meaning must be available in an accurate form to all human minds. All these statements, each in the language of a particular conventional divi- sion of human knowledge, mean the same thing philosophically. Until the human consciousness achieves this-if it ever does-the up-and-down cy- cles of human history will continue. The down cycles witness to the, so far contem- porary and partial, biological failures of the human consciousness;, it is then losing its grip upon its sector of nature and permit- ting the human species to slip back to- ward-but not yet ever into-animal sav- agery. If it be true that to date the' con- sciousness has made progress in its evolu- tionary task, that progress is one of a spiral kind, but certainly an irregular and spas- modic spiral kind; that is to say, the later civilized societies should if there is progress, have accomplished moie than the earlier, but within such a general progress there is plenty of room for failure of some later so- cieties to achieve more than or as much as, some earlier societies. And, naturally enough, the accomplishments of some earlier so- cieties in particular, special directions may very well exceed those of later societies in those directions. (Hence all of human his- tory is relevant to present and future human needs; parts of it must not -be excluded on the ground that other parts are'more "rep- resentative" of human evolutionary prog- ress, the ground on which Kahler -presumes to 'exclude the history of China and India.) The human consciousness evolved in nature to meet certain needs of the stock which produced the human species. Biol- ogists have but a somewhat vague idea yet of what those needs were. As it evolved it disturbed the adaptation of the prehuman ancestors of man to their environment; I9 Supposing, as is fundamental to my thesis, that that sector is limited, or can only be known objec- tively as limited. evolved to meet some existing maladjust- ment, its evolution effected new maladjust- ments. If the human consciousness is to achieve its evolutionary destiny, it must eliminate all those new maladjustments and effect a complete new adaptation to the nat- ural environment of humanity. Every newly evolved specialization faces this challenge of nature. Biologists say that most of them fail. If they fail utterly, they lead on by way of overspecialization to extinction of the species; this is true of the great majority of specializations. There are others which seem to have led into a virtual-never, so far as we know, an actual and completely repeti- tive-stability of the relation between species and environment. A good example of a kind exhibiting great complexity (which most do not) is the physique and societies of the Hymenoptera. There are all manner of compromises between virtual stability and extinction, all involving a measure of de- generacy-before virtual stability is reached. According to most biologists, the human consciousness is the only specialization in nature which is still making evolutionary progress-but how much do we know of nature? Whether this be so or not, there is not the least guaranty that human evolu- tionary progress will continue. Our civilized societies may spiral downward; they may already-be doing so. The spirals may lead us quite suddenly to extinction. Even if we achieve a single, world-wide civilized so- ciety, which would no doubt happen only after the failure of the three chief societies now existing (the Western, Third Chinese, and Third Indian) that single society, or another succeeding it, might decline and lead right down to extinction; perhaps its singularity would make it the more likely to do so. Perhaps we shall reach virtual stabili- ty in a number of separate societies (as the Hymenoptera have done), all of them at a higher level of attainment than' contempo- rary societies, or all of them at a-lower, or some at a higher and some at a lower level of attainment. Perhaps we shall achieve a single world-wide society considerably high- er in evolutionary progress than any which</page><page sequence="18">DISCUSSION 63 exist today and there reach virtual stability. Perhaps .... ? Perhaps we can pass beyond the limits of our planet. Perhaps the achievements of other species are' not a guide to the total and final, achievements of the human species; that they are a guide to some of the achieve- ments of the human species is already suf- ficiently witnessed by the extensive similari- ties between human and other physical and social organisms. There is a school of thought which regards the past achieve- ments of the human consciousness as so much greater in degree than the achieve- ments of other consciousnesses that a pre- sumption is set up that human achievements will eventually differ in kind from those of other species. If this view is sound, it seems highly probable from our present knowledge of our sector of nature that such new achieve- ments would not exclude achievements anal- ogous to those of other species but would in- clude them and then pass beyond them. I mean by this that the virtual stability of so- ciety and physique, always reached at some level or other by those species which have not gone, down to extinction, would not be rendered wholly irrelevant to the future of humanity; a situation would be reached in human evolution, in spite of the novelty of eventual human achievements, which would correspond to virtual stability, and that sit- uation would embody the elimination of the present and past cyclic process in the his- tory of human societies. So far as we know, absolute novelty of various degrees of magnitude emerges from nature from time to time: the emergence of life was such novelty, and the emergence of every species was so in a lesser degree. What is clear from our knowledge of our human sector of nature is that we cannot know be- forehand whether absolute novelty of a major order does lie in the future of human evolution or, if it does, its character. Neither history nor all our knowledge will show us more than approximate generalities in the future constructed out of mutually exclusive possibilities analogous to events which have occurred in the past. By hypothesis any analogy in the past with a future transcen- dence by humanity of the virtual stability achieved by other surviving species must be so broad as to afford no definite knowledge of the novelty. Our ability to predict, there- fore, stops short with the possibility of such novelty, with the probability of the end of the cyclic process in the history of human societies-the probability of virtual stability in some aspects of the human relationship to the rest of nature; and otherwise only with numerous mutually exclusive possibili- ties as to when and how, excepting extinc- tion, that stability will be reached. Our knowledge, finally, does perhaps permiit us to reach a certain sense of proportion about the present and about our Western Society, in their relations to the past and to the fu- ture of human evolution. Important as con- temporary events and as our own society may seem to us-important, for all we know, as they may even, in fact, be in the great whole of nature-our judgment of that im- portanc'e is worth little; our guessing about our own future is chiefly of importance to us today, much less so to humanity at large in time, still less, so to nature; and, if we do guess, the value to us of our guesses will depend upon the breadth of extension we can achieve in our existing knowledge and the soundness of the proportions we can es- tablish within the matter of that knowledge.
