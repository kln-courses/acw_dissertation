<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wandering Archetypes in Schubert's Instrumental Music WILLIAM KINDERMAN The wanderer archetype permeates the art and literature of early Romanticism, reflecting the dualistic world picture that emerged from the collapse of older certainties. The process was double-edged. As the human mind came to con- strue the universe as impersonal, mechanistic, and soulless, expropriating higher conscious- ness to itself, it participated in the ultimate anthropomorphic projection. Aspects of this process have been analyzed recently by Rich- ard Tarnas in his book The Passion of the West- ern Mind.' The mechanization of the world picture2 greatly aided the goals of natural sci- ence, but it also contributed to an increasing sense of existential isolation. For if, as Kant argued, we have access only to appearances, and not things-in-themselves, then the ulti- mate ground of the world lies beyond us, mys- terious and unknowable. It is hardly accidental that the early nineteenth century brought new sensitivity to the polarity between impersonal nature and the introspective individual human being. In Kant's famous formulation, this po- larity was viewed affirmatively, as a sublime contrast between "the starry heavens above us and the moral law within us."3 The familiar 19th-Century Music XXI/2 (Fall 1997). ? by The Regents of the University of California. An early version of this study was presented at the Inter- national Conference "Schubert and the Wanderer" held at the University of Victoria in March 1993.

Franz Schubert's contemporary from North Germany, Friedrich developed the wanderer ar- chetype in impressive paintings, including The Monk at the Sea, The Man and Woman Look- ing at the Moon, and The Wanderer Above the Mists, among others. As Charles Rosen has recently stressed, "'pure' landscape in paint- or in verse or prose-now attempted to render the sense of natural, not human, history, the visible evidence of past time in the personal sensation.... The picturesque landscape with ruins of the eighteenth century was replaced by landscape as itself a progressive ruin-the pro- cess of corruption and renewal in Nature."4 The visionary aesthetic content of these and similar works by Friedrich emerges out of a contrast between an objective natural environ- ment independent of humanity, and the view- point of the individual human subject. In a painting like Friedrich's Crucifix and Cathe- dral in the Mountains, from 1811 (plate 1), the perspective shown is that of a wanderer, and the absence of human figures takes on an un- settling character.5 The human symbols for tran- scendence and the deity are seemingly con- tested and put into question here by the sublime natural context into which they have been transplanted: a vast, unordered, inhospi- table ground of being, a world indifferent to civilization. The Lieder and song cycles of Schubert give incomparable musical expression to the experi- ential predicament of the wanderer that so fas- cinated Friedrich. Comparison of the two Muiller song cycles, Die sch6ne Miillerin and Winter- reise, shows an important progression in Schubert's encounter with the wanderer arche- type that has repercussions in his later instru- mental music. As Peter Gillke points out in his book on Schubert, the protagonist of the earlier cycle is rooted in concrete poetic images, which are largely withdrawn in the Winterreise. The wanderer figure of The Winter's Journey is not "poetized" in descriptive terms but himself be- comes the poet.6 His identity and background remain shadowy. Attention focuses on points of correspondence between the inward sensibility of the wanderer and outward natural objects such as the frozen stream, cold wind, circling crow or howling dogs.7 As in Friedrich's paintings, this wanderer does not face us, but peers into the unknown and unfathomable. He lacks control over his environment. The ultimate destination of the journey in Winterreise is identified with "the path from which no one has ever returned,"8 that is, death. Schubert conveys with particular power in Winterreise the duality between the inner world of the imagination-dreams, aspirations, and bright memories-and the outer world of exter- nal reality. Most often, this external reality confronting the protagonist is indifferent, ba- nal, or hostile and threatening in character. The resulting duality captivated Schubert, as is reflected for instance in his allegorical story "My Dream," from 1822, with its striking de- piction of a self divided between love and pain. Schubert writes: "I sang songs for many many years. If I wanted to sing of love, it turned into pain. And if I wanted to sing of pain, it became love."9 Numerous songs from Erlk6nig (1815) to Ihr Bild (1828) show how the dichotomy of inner experience and outward perception rooted in the poetry was expressed even more vividly in the music. Schubert typically underscores this experiential duality through a combina- tion of thematic and modal contrast often coupled with abrupt modulation. 4Charles Rosen, The Romantic Generation (New York, 1995), p. 147. 5This painting is reproduced in color with a brief commentary in the anthology The Modern World as part of the series Landmarks of the World's Art, ed.

In "Friihlingstraum" from Winterreise, to cite one familiar example, the lyrical, dancelike melody associated with dreams of spring is jux- taposed with a rude, cold awakening in dark- ness that is represented musically by a plunge into unstable minor keys, together with a faster, insistent vocal declamation underscored by jagged, dissonant inflections in the piano. Such expressive shifts lie at the core of Schubert's poetic interpretation. Thus the very first word of the first song of Winterreise, "Fremd" (alien), triggers or motivates the minor mode and dis- sonant inflections of "Gute Nacht": only in the last strophe, with its ironic reference to the beloved, does the music turn to the major, at "Will dich im Traum nicht st6ren, war' Schad' 210</page><page sequence="4">WILLIAM KINDERMAN Wandering Archetypes um deine Ruh" (I don't want to disturb you in your dreams, that would be a pity for your peace of mind). A full-bodied resonance of sound with major harmonies is often reserved in Winterreise for dreams, visions, or bright recol- lections, such as the question "wo find' ich griines Gras?" (Where do I find green grass?) when first posed in "Erstarrung," or the oasis in "Lindenbaum" under the tree, where "I dreamt in its shade so many sweet dreams" (ich trdiumt' in seinem Schatten so manchen siissen Traum). Use of the major mode in "Auf dem Flusse" is tied to a mood of reminiscence (the carving of the name of the beloved into the ice), a mood that assumes more prominence in the following song, "Riickblick," even sustain- ing a close in the major. To be sure, in some of the last songs-"Das Wirthshaus" and "Die Nebensonnen"-Schubert employs the major in association with an exhausted yearning for oblivion, whereas in the second strophe of "Der Wegweiser" (The Signpost) its use is linked to the innocence of the protagonist (I have done nothing wrong, that I should avoid people). Yet the entire song preceding "Der Wegweiser," "Tiuschung" (Illusion), reaffirms in the most striking way the shiny, dancing image of delu- sion in the major key: "nur Taiuschung ist ffir mich Gewinn!" (Only illusion is good for me!). Analogous musical contrasts already invest some of Schubert's earlier instrumental works, for instance, the Allegretto quasi Andantino of the Sonata in A Minor, D. 537, from 1817. The appearances of the charming lyrical main theme in E major are separated by two contrasting episodes, of which the second, longer episode in D minor suggests a slow march. Growing out of the march is an uncanny transition, with chromatic thirds and syncopated accents played above a mysterious sustained pedal point in the bass on B. Yet moments later, this note shines in the radiance of the final statement of the main theme in E major, with all the lucid transparency of chamber music. This melody continued to captivate Schubert, who used it as the main subject of the rondo finale of the Piano Sonata in A Major, D. 959, to be dis- cussed below. In earlier studies I have attempted to show how Schubert employs such heightened the- matic, tonal and modal contrasts in a number of important later instrumental compositions.10 Schubert's treatment of his lyrical second themes in works like the Quartettsatz or the first movements of the "Unfinished" Symphony and the G-Major Quartet, D. 887, invite such interpretation. But some of the most impres- sive examples of musical contrast showing an affinity to the wanderer archetype are found in certain of Schubert's slow movements of his later instrumental pieces. The Andante un poco moto of the G-Major Quartet and the Alle- gretto forming the second of the three Klavier- stficke, D. 946, absorb such contrasts into rondolike designs. Schubert employs a ternary form in the two remarkable slow movements to be examined in this essay: the Piano Sonata in A Major, D. 959, and the String Quintet in C, D. 956, both works from 1828. The Adagio of the Quintet in C and Andantino of the Sonata in A each employ a quiet, almost static main theme, with the melody stressing a few crucial pitches in a nar- row register while repetitive motivic figures serve as accompaniment. In both movements, the middle sections bring drastic contrast and dynamically varied textures. These sections can scarcely be regarded as "themes"; Werner Tho- mas, in a study of the Quintet, has written more fittingly of "an organized chaos on the verge of catastrophe."" As Thomas notes, the effect stems from Schubert's fusion of calcula- tion and disorientation; the music is highly organized, but it gives the impression of dis- ruptive activity of an almost violent character. In his songs, Schubert sometimes employs a repetitive melodic fragment in a fixed register juxtaposed with more varied, contrasting mu- sic. One such example is the setting of Riickert's Dass sie hier gewesen, D. 775 (That she was here), in which the memory of the beloved is confined to a single melodic phrase in the ma- jor, whereas the remaining music associated with present reality is more expansive in its '0See my "Schubert's Tragic Perspective," in Schubert: Critical and Analytical Studies, pp. 65-83; "Der thema- tische Kontrast in Schuberts Instrumentalmusik und die Dichotomie von innerer und aufuerer Erfahrung," Musiktheorie 3 (1988), 157-70.

In Schubert's instrumen- tal pieces under consideration here, on the other hand, the contrast in character is much more extreme. One is reminded of some of Mozart's Adagios and Andantes, in which, as Maynard Solomon has recently pointed out, "a calm, contemplative, or ecstatic condition gives way to a troubled state-is penetrated by hints of storm, dissonance, anguish, anxiety, danger- and this in turn is succeeded by a restoration of the status quo ante, now suffused with and transformed by the memory of the turbulent interlude." Solomon refers especially to the use of this dramatic compositional pattern in Mozart's A-Minor Piano Sonata, K. 310/300d (1778) and observes that despite the striking contrasts, the darkening of mood, the piercing, almost Schubertian dissonances, the brood- ing intensity, the relentlessness of the rapid modula- tions through a shifting sequence of major and mi- nor keys, Mozart has no intention of giving way to chaos and disruption .... Instead, after this outburst has spent its force, he moves to reinstate the origi- nal, Edenic condition, which is now heightened by melodic ornamentation and figurative elaboration.12 In developing this Mozartean topos, Schubert controls the process of transition in ways that also suggest an affinity to a Beethovenian model, the "Appassionata" Sonata, op. 57. In the "Appassionata," Beethoven encloses his slow movement, a series of contemplative variations on a hymnlike theme in D? major, between turbulent fast movements in F minor. At the transition to the finale, the dreamlike vision of the Andante is shattered by a relentless reitera- tion of diminished-seventh chords signaling the pivotal reinterpretation of the previously stable tonic note D? as the dissonant, flat-sixth degree of F minor. This sudden collapse of the hymnlike lyrical music in D? major into a darkly threatening idiom in F minor, wherein the note Db becomes an acutely emphasized dissonance, contributes decisively to the despairing charac- ter of the work. Already in the development of the opening Allegro assai of op. 57, the lyrical second theme in Db major had gradually dis- solved, yielding itself up to dissonant dimin- ished-seventh arpeggios as the music, in Tovey's words, became "inarticulate."13 Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht has regarded the Andante as the enlargement to an entire movement of this sec- ond theme idea from the first movement:'4 with the denial of cadence and self-sufficiency to the Andante in its last measures comes a moment of tragic realization, as the strife-ridden F-mi- nor idiom reasserts its primacy. What bears comparison to Schubert here is the way the stable tonic sonority of the con- templative music is reinterpreted and subverted as a crushing, emphasized dissonance in the contrasting idiom. This pivotal reinterpretation involves an overlapping in sound, as audible substance from one movement is drawn into a new modality in "a gesture of complete nega- tion, almost a display of disappointed anger," to cite Lawrence Kramer's description of the transition in the "Appassionata."'" That con- frontation in the "Appassionata" occurs at the harmonic substitution of an arpeggiated dimin- ished seventh beneath the cadential Db in the treble that might, under other circumstances, have closed the movement (ex. 1). The arpeg- giated chord returns an octave higher and then is reiterated thirteen times in the original register at the outset of the Allegro ma non troppo, now intensified rhythmically and dy- namically. The "self-sufficiency" of the varia- tion movement is thus annihilated, as Db, the tonic note of the slow movement, becomes a crucial dissonance in F minor, recalling a simi- lar treatment in the first movement. Indeed, from those thirteen repeated fortissimo chords Beethoven derives the principal theme of the finale by composing out the diminished-sev- enth chord as a sinuous line in sixteenth notes, which descends by thirds into the lowest regis- '2This and the preceding quotation are drawn from Maynard Solomon, Mozart: A Life (New York, 1995), pp. 187-90.

This structural downbeat marks the true be- ginning of the finale, after the Schreckensfanfare of the chords and the descending transitionary passagework, but it is from this passagework that the figuration of the finale proper is drawn. Within Schubert's slow movements in the Quintet and A-Major Sonata, a somewhat analo- gous contrast emerges between the contempla- tive main themes and an almost explosive ten- sion that emerges in the middle section of the ternary form. In each of these pieces, as in Beethoven's "Appassionata," the previously stable and secure tonic is reinterpreted and de- stabilized. Hence, in the Adagio of the Quintet, the cadential tonic note E that was gently af- firmed in the final measures of the opening section (triple pianissimo in the celli) is sud- denly transformed into a unison trill in all the instruments, becoming leading note to F mi- nor, with the pivotal destabilizing shift under- scored by the crescendo to fortissimo and by the ensuing syncopations and other textural means (ex. 2). The parallel passage in the Andantino of the A-Major Sonata, on the other hand, reinter- prets the four-measure phrase pattern of the preceding music (ex. 3). The soft, pianissimo close to the opening section with a tonic pedal in the left hand (mm. 65-68) is followed here by a mysterious transition that audibly elabo- rates the preceding repeated F#s in its texture while expanding them registrally. Thus the four- measure phrase in mm. 69-72 begins and ends at the pitch level of the repeated F#s, while arching upward nearly two octaves to encom- pass the melodic peak on D, corresponding to m. 57 of the Andantino. The positioning of this phrase on F# does not hold the ensuing music on that sonority: the stabilizing pedal has now disappeared, and Schubert adjusts the rhythm and articulation of the descending scale in mm. 71-72 to guide the music toward the following four-measure phrase resting on F?, a half tone lower. This and the following phrases, which are supported by harmonically ambiguous di- minished-seventh chords, combine a pattern of chromatic descent with a subdivision of rhyth- mic values to thirty-second notes and a com- pression of the phrasing into two-measure units. The first point of relative tonal stability in the passage is reached in m. 85 at the cadence in C minor-the most distant of relations from the earlier, stable F# tonality, reinforcing thereby the drastic transformation in character that is taking place in the music. Gillke discusses such contrasts in Schubert's Quintet and Sonata as eruptions, breakthroughs or breaches in the prevailing musical discourse and claims that such events are too radical to be resolved.16 According to Gillke, Schubert's 16Giilke, Franz Schubert und seine Zeit, pp. 294-99. Giilke's terminology is reminiscent of that of Theodor W. Adorno in his classic book Mahler: Fine musikalische Physio- gnomik (Frankfurt, 1960). There is a deep affinity between Schubert and Mahler in their appropriation of the wanderer archetype and in their related employment of heightened contrasts. 213</page><page sequence="7">19TH CENTURY MUSIC ,-  - .pizz.

The unleashing of disruptive and apparently cha- otic forces protects Schubert from any suspi- cion of overindulgence in sensuous beauty. At the same time, it is instructive to observe to what extent these breaches in the prevailing music bear a relation to passages in other move- ments, as is apparently the case in Beethoven's "Appassionata" Sonata. In the Quintet, the intervallic relation that generates the shocking F-minor middle section within the E-major Adagio is deeply anchored in the other movements as well. Tonal rela- tions exploiting the half tones adjacent to the tonic and dominant are especially prominent. The scherzo in C major, with its driving rhyth- mic momentum, is juxtaposed with a sustained, almost motionless, subterranean trio in Db. The development of the first movement turns to F# minor, whereas the passage leading to the reca- pitulation stresses the half tone resolving to the dominant, or AL-G. Both of the outer move- ments of the Quintet contain extended rising linear progressions that are largely chromatic. At two points in the Quintet, Schubert concen- trates the chromatic half-tone movement by having all five instruments play it in unison. One of these comes at the very end of the finale, following the resolution of the climactic augmented-sixth chord three measures from the conclusion (see ex. 4). This striking closing ges- ture is the half tone Db-C, which encapsulates a characteristic tension in the work as a whole.

The passage in question is pre- cisely the transition from the E-major Adagio into the F-minor middle section of the move- ment, the music described by Thomas as "or- ganized chaos on the verge of catastrophe." Here the rising half step forms a pivot between two antithetical worlds of expression. For Schubert as for Beethoven, E major often served as a key of exalted lyricism, and even celestial contemplation. One thinks in this con- nection of examples in Beethoven ranging from the second subject of the opening movement of the "Waldstein" Sonata to the slow movements of the Quartet, op. 59, no. 2, and of op. 109 and 215</page><page sequence="9">19TH CENTURY MUSIC the central slow variation of the Adagio of the Quartet, op. 127, not to mention songs such as Wonne der Wehmut (Bliss in Sorrow) or the Opferlied. In Schubert, such parallels can be sought in "Der Lindenbaum," the major-mode passage in "Trockene Blumen" and "Des Baches Wiegenlied" in Die sch6ne Miillerin, and in the second movement of the "Unfinished" Sym- phony. The ethereal, choralelike setting of Schubert's Adagio has a distinctive texture, with a trio of sustained inner voices framed in the outer reg- isters by the pizzicato cello alternating with short motivic figures in the first violin. The slow tempo, spacious measures of the 82 meter, and the soft dynamic level contribute to a char- acter of spiritualized tranquil calm. A some- what similar texture characterizes the Andante sostenuto of Schubert's last Piano Sonata in B1, in which an accompanimental figure spanning a range of four octaves under and over the melody assumes a function analogous to the alternating duet of first violin and second cello in the Quintet. Schubert blurs his stratification of instrumental parts only toward the end of the Quintet passage, as the first violin descends into the middle register, joins with the other instruments at the approach to the cadence in E major, and plays pizzicato together with the cello, for the first time, in the last measure before the change in key (see ex. 2). The E- major section comes to a soft, unambiguous close here, in a spirit of passive serenity. In relation to this character of still contem- plation, the ensuing disruptive passage assumes all the more impact. The unison upbeat to a trill in all five instruments with a crescendo to fortissimo at the resolution launches the mu- sic into the intensely agitated expressive envi- ronment of the F-minor section. The complex, jagged textures of Schubert's ensuing passage nevertheless take on a quality of gigantic sim- plicity. Initially, only the accompanimental voices are heard in the second violin, viola, and second cello; the melodic parts enter one mea- sure later. Schubert derives much material from the crucial rising half step E-F that opened the door to the pandemonium. The second cello part, for instance, is at first wholly derived from this relation and "composes out" the reso- lution into nervous, detached triplet figures. The other accompanimental voices are racked by syncopations, which greatly heighten the rhythmic tension. The seminal motivic idea of the trill resolv- ing up a half tone with a crescendo is not for- gotten. Schubert employs a series of three such trills in the melodic voices to generate the first great climax, on a sonority of C minor ten measures into the section. But a later and even more shattering culmination is reached in those following passages where the melody itself be- comes stymied or blocked, reiterating the single pitch A with increasing intensity sevenfold per measure (ex. 5, m. 50). The second time this occurs sufficient energy is generated to support two rising sequences, reaching an accented B- minor chord (m. 52) that might be regarded as the climactic peak of the entire movement. Then, in the immense decrescendo and registral descent that follows, Schubert maintains the musical tension by obscuring the sense of tonal direction. As Giilke puts it, the section ends in a "diffuse somewhere";17 for some moments, the music seems to wander. without clear di- rection, before the void is filled through a re- prise of the E-major theme, now heard with an elaborated texture of sixteenth- and thirty-sec- ond notes in the two outer voices. At the end of the movement, Schubert re- calls the pivotal transition that had led earlier from E major into F minor. This time, how- ever, the trill is confined to the first violin, while the middle voices retain the continuous, sustained choralelike texture. The effect of this brief but intense reminiscence is much less that of a resolution than of a reminder of the anguished, antithetical forces that continue to lurk behind the sublime surface of this reflec- tive music. Schubert's treatment of disruptive contrast is even more radical in the extraordinary Andantino in F# minor that forms the center of gravity of the A-Major Sonata. The almost hyp- notic effect of its main theme recalls several of the Heine songs and "Der Leiermann" from Winterreise. Some indications of its expressive associations may be gained from analogy to the "7Gtilke, Franz Schubert und seine Zeit, p. 297. 216</page><page sequence="10">WILLIAM KINDERMAN Wandering Archetypes 49 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I I cresc .----- -----------------------------------------. 3 3 3 pp cresc.---------- ---------------------- pp 3 3 3 I lI.I, I 1 Ir - op Ip N a'wt!V r- I  f- ILIr: r I - - I " f. . pp- cresc- - -------------------------------------- IL I ' - -: pp cresc ------------------------------------------------------------ 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 if _ _ _ _ _ ff Example 5: Schubert, String Quintet in C, movt.

The controlled melodic repetitions of this theme stress a few important pitches in a narrow register and create an atmosphere of melancholic contemplation, or obsession. As in the Quintet, the almost static quality of this music is also connected to its structural role in the movement as a whole. Nowhere else did Schubert employ such an extreme contrast as in this Andantino, where the music of the fol- lowing middle section seems to unleash not just turbulence and foreboding, but chaotic vio- lence. Here, as so often in Schubert, the con- trasting sections are brought together purpose- fully and need to be heard in relation to one another. The outer sections of this ternary mu- sical form thus embody the reflective mood of the lyrical subject, but the music of the con- trasting middle section annihilates this frame of reference. After the descending sequences of amorphous passagework reach C minor, the most remote of key relations from the tonic, the music continues to build relentlessly, ex- ploiting the most extreme registers and a struc- tural use of trills as a means of sustaining the tension of the musical lines at fixed levels of pitch. The approach to C# minor at the climax is achieved in a passage of savage intensity. Following this climax, a fragile recitative ap- pears, only to be broken off repeatedly by mas- sive chords (ex. 7).

Example 7: Schubert, Piano Sonata in A Major, D. 959, movt. II, mm. 120-31. served,18 one can sense an affinity between Schubert and another great painter of the age, the aging Francisco Goya, who in his etchings and paintings of war left a damning indictment of human cruelty, and of the fragile vulnerabil- ity of individual human beings confronted by power. In this sense, the Andantino of Schu- bert's A-Major Sonata bears comparison with Goya's painting Third of May, 1808, which is based on the contrast between the hard, irratio- nal brutality of the soldiers making up the firing squad and the soft, defenseless, and crumbling human targets. The nineteenth-century myth of Schubert's easy-going naivet6 dies hard, and few artists have probed so deeply into the tragic aspects of the human condition. But if Schubert's treatment of the wanderer archetype often tends toward the tragic, it also admits a wide range of psychological nuance. This is especially the case in the instrumental piece the A-Major Sonata, which, like the Quin- tet in C, shows an unusually subtle network of thematic connections linking its four move- ments. Perhaps no other of Schubert's works contains intermovement connections that are more substantial or poetically evocative. These go beyond motivic kinships linking various themes of the four movements to involve a far- reaching treatment of thematic recall and tonal allusion that is not without relevance to our interpretation of the Andantino movement. Most striking is Schubert's allusion, in the closing measures of his finale, to the principal theme of his first movement. This device is surely inspired by the model of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in G Major, op. 31, no. 1, which offered the formal prototype for Schubert's finale, as both Edward T. Cone and Charles Rosen have shown.19 The immediately preced- ing passages of Schubert's coda, in which phrases from the principal theme are broken off into silence, and reharmonized in unexpected keys before the plunge into a whirlwind Presto, also recall and develop Beethoven's model. But Schubert makes other allusions between move- ments that owe nothing directly to Beethoven. These include moments of transition from one movement to the next, as when Schubert reharmonizes the repeated A closing the open- ing Allegro as the third degree of F# minor to begin the Andantino, or when he anticipates paradoxically the joyous arpeggio chords of the scherzo in the closing measures of the preced- ing Andantino, with arpeggios in the low regis- ter. The climax of the scherzo, on the other hand, seems to allude to the turbulent middle section of the slow movement and even em- ploys a powerful fortissimo gesture with a long descending scale supported by C#-minor chords in the bass. Even more conspicuous is Schubert's transformation of the opening theme of the first movement in the trio of his scherzo. Here '8Personal communication. '"Compare Edward T.

Yet the passage most of all evocative of strings comes in the coda of the first movement, where the main theme appears in a similarly delicate texture with high sus- tained chords supported by staccato bass notes suggestive of pizzicato. Hence the trio of Schubert's scherzo seems to be related most directly to the coda of the first movement, a passage that in turn imaginatively transforms the seminal main theme. To these relations I add another passage that has received little attention in the scholarly literature, namely the developmental episode and ensuing reprise in the middle of the rondo- sonata finale, with its ethereal transformation of the principal theme in F# major. The episode grows out of a statement of the main rondo theme in A major. The music turns into the minor, as a forceful, dramatic development of the theme leads through various keys before reaching C# minor, the key of the climax of the Andantino. Schubert now expands the C# to- nality in an enormous passage of thirty-two measures employing triplets in the middle reg- ister and a motivic dialogue exploiting extremes of register in the treble and bass. The immense tonal platform on C# serves a dominant prepa- ration for F#, and it is in this key-and not the tonic A major-that the recapitulation begins. This unusual treatment of the recapitula- tion is bound up with a highly significant intermovement connection between the finale and the Andantino. Twelve measures before the thematic return, the music reaches a ca- dence in C# major, with the arpeggios in pre- cisely the same register as the melody at the beginning of the Andantino. (The two passages are shown in ex. 8a and b.) Not only is the juxtaposition of the F#-minor and C#-major chords parallel in the two passages, but these sonorities are held for a roughly comparable time, since one measure of 4 time in the Alle- retto is not much longer than one measure of 8 in the Andantino. Schubert combines another half-tone relation with the vacillation between A and G# by emphasizing D in the highest register in the second and fourth measures of the example, while resolving this dissonant minor ninth to the C# three octaves lower. The expressive half-tone relation is made gigantic, spread out to resonate over the entire tonal space, while the harmonic support in the trip- let arpeggios unmistakably recalls the sonori- ties from the earlier slow movement.20 In both movements, the tonic and dominant alternate 20For a recent and thorough discussion of the importance of Schubert's handling of resonance as an expressive device, see Robert S.

The stress on the half tone D-C# in this passage of the finale can also be heard as a development of the har- monic and linear relations that are so conspicu- ous in the Andantino. Most extraordinary, however, is Schubert's treatment of the thematic reprise beginning in F# major, in a transparent texture played pia- nissimo. This passage is no mere "false" re- prise but a highly significant resolution. Har- monically, of course, the immense dominant preparation in C# makes the tonality of F# seem not surprising, but fitting; it is rather the turn to A major as tonic nine measures into the reprise that makes us rely more heavily on our tonal memory of the work as a whole to sup- port a recognition of that event as a stable return and a homecoming. What accounts then for the delicately allusive, almost magical, ef- fect of the F#-major reprise? The answer to this question is bound up once again with a link to the Andantino movement, a relation constitut- ing one of the most fascinating intermovement references in all Schubert's works. We may regard the F#-major passage as em- bodying a vision of the slow movement glimpsed through the veil of the rondo theme. The possibility of making such intermovement allusions even in the absence of a direct the- matic recall was exploited by Beethoven in cer- tain of his finales, such as the rondo of the C- Minor Piano Concerto, op. 37, whose central episode incorporates an unmistakable though transparently delicate allusion to the preceding Largo movement in E major.21 But in Schubert's A-Major Sonata there is a crucial difference: if this is a vision of the slow movement, it is a transfigured vision. The minor tonality that had been so poignantly emphasized just mo- ments before is left behind: for the first and only time in the sonata, F# major is brought to sound. If this passage opens a window to the slow movement, it shows none of the grim tragic implications of the Andantino, but, on the contrary, offers a healing, resolving per- spective, hinting at a potential solution to the dualistic dilemma of the slow movement. Studies of intellectual history have rarely done justice to the role of music, which as- sumed special cultural significance in the nine- teenth century. Schubert's musical interpreta- tions of the wanderer archetype in Winterreise or in the slow movements of the Quintet, D. 956, and the A-Major Sonata, D. 959, are among the most penetrating artistic embodiments ever created of the modern existential dilemma. But if Schubert's music carries associations to the duality of inward imagination and outward per- ception, and to the dialectic of "love" and "pain," it is not locked within these dichoto- mies. The finale of the sonata, in particular, looks back at the wanderer's dilemma and briefly envisions a way out, a Schillerian "ef- figy of the ideal" or symbol of perfection. Later, in his coda, Schubert hints at alternatives left unexplored or roads not taken as he rehar- monizes the successive phrases of his main theme, breaking off each into evocative silences. There is a compatibility here between a recog- nition of the open universe and the discovery of deeper unities or archetypal structures that bond the human mind with the world beyond it. Schubert's importance lies both in his inti- mate knowledge of the dualistic world view and in his glimpse of a solution to the dilemma, opening a window of escape from the ORT, double bind of modern existence. 4W 2"A detailed discussion of this passage is offered in my study, Beethoven, pp. 68-72.
